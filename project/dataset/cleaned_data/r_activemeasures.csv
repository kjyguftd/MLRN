this election is about voting against trump and bidens age changes nothing about that you are correct this is true for people like you and me and most everyone else on this sub or in politics who is aware of the stakes the mistake in your thinking is extrapolating this to all voters far from a rare breed id argue the majority of voters are some variation of unawareuncaring about the issue of democracyrisks of trump and a noninsignificant number will decide their vote based on how the candidates perform publicly <number><number> of voters flipping for trump because biden acts old can be what puts trump in the white house given how close this race is that is why people are panicking its not about people like us who will vote no matter what against trump its always been about the voters who can be swayedconvinced to either bidens campaign pushed for the debate to show that although biden is old he doesnt act old and he acted old so people are now questioning if running biden is now riskier than going for an unknown other candidate,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQX2ZtMDM4NzNidzNtOHYtSmMxQUdFZFVIYXBhczZtQmE2eUhmWjVOdG50SzJpRS1OdGVZX2VxYnp3WW1DNS11SG42TmtSNGJ0ZnFLcF9Vbjdlem81SlE9PQ==

the problem now is they use ai so its not obvious with the broken english poor grammar etc its extremely easy to pump out generic antibiden comments sounding as if they are liberal left and supported biden before saw this linked on another thread in another sub they just automate variations of commands like that not typing it out each time <url>,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXM0VmX0xhbnpqSTgwcDZEaXJTZ3UzblJzVlptWTdUT0FRNGhuOEZVVWFXUHJOTF93SDVPTEdNRUFsNTV6czZTSzAtNF9idWVtUG01eVE0VF9sdlVaZ0xOSHlCY25zbXFmdm5DQkRzU1hPZTQ9

yep most of the content the media outlets pump out is aimed at the heavily politically engaged online like regulars on rpolitics these people represent a small portion of the population but most people are too busy to consume political news all day and skip most of it with the limited free time they have and astroturfers in those spaces already filled with doomers quick to freak out type people and bad faith but legit people influencing popular views in them will negatively influence them more and in turn influence the content these outlets pump out trying to appeal to these types,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWmxvNlViOFdKUHRzOEQweXJicjFtb3ZKUFllbDNPcG1haUhUaGVyWWRXN2dpSk9jYm5ORENOUTdqQVh2T1JTSGhKU29MYl9UNldJeU1XcjJvX1lReGhZTFM4MEhFSXZzd1dnT2FBRFBLUVk9

a network of russiabased websites masquerading as local american newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an aipowered operation that is increasingly targeting the us election a bbc investigation can reveal a former florida police officer who relocated to moscow is one of the key figures behind it the following would have been a bombshell report if it were true olena zelenska the first lady of ukraine allegedly bought a rare bugatti tourbillon sports car for <number>m euros <cur><number>m <cur><number>m while visiting paris for dday commemorations in june the source of the funds was supposedly american military aid money the story appeared on an obscure french website just days ago and was swiftly debunked experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online a whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created bugatti issued a sharp denial calling it fake news and its paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story but before the truth could even get its shoes on the lie had gone viral influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely one x user the prorussia prodonald trump activist jackson hinkle posted a link seen by more than <number>m people several other accounts spread the story to millions more x users at least m in total according to the sites metrics it was a fake story on a fake news website designed to spread widely online with its origins in a russiabased disinformation operation bbc verify first revealed last year at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine ukraines government our latest investigation carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites found that the operation has a new target american voters dozens of bogus stories tracked by the bbc appear aimed at influencing us voters and sowing distrust ahead of novembers election some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the us congress the story of the bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation ukrainian corruption us aid spending and the inner workings of french high society another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at american politics it was published on a website called the houston post one of dozens of sites with americansounding names which are in reality run from moscow and alleged that the fbi illegally wiretapped donald trumps florida resort it played neatly into trumps allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him mr trump himself has accused the fbi of snooping on his conversations experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort led from moscow to spread disinformation during the us election campaign while no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the russian state researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous kremlinbacked efforts to spread disinformation in the west russia will be involved in the us <number> election as will others said chris krebs who as the director of the us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the <number> presidential election were already seeing them from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere enter the fray pushing against already contentious points in us politics he said the bbc contacted the russian foreign ministry and russias us and uk embassies but received no response we also attempted to contact mr hinkle for comment see link for the rest of the article,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXdTI0U3MzdkdHY09ZeFlydWw1MUJaci16WFVZaUh0X3p3TlZzV3RORTU1eWswNFEzWkVnOXI1RnNwT0FDRXJ5c1pJczVWc3ZRN0U4ZnNEdjY5MkdQenc9PQ==

okay with you using words like woke and having an overall narrow view of the benefits of diversity equity and inclusion makes it really difficult for me to care about your opinions and strawman arguments but ive got some free time so ill bite >theyre a tractor supply company who meets the needs of farmers not an inner city nonprofit >and because they wont now freaking tractors are part of the patriarchy you do realize that tractor supply doesnt actually sell tractors right it even lists it on their website what can you buy at tractor supply company everything except tractors they sell lawn mowers theyre not john deere >who wins from boycotting the tractor supply so were you on board with the conservative activist robby starbuck when he was calling to boycott tractor supply back in <number> for their lgbtq+ and dei hiring initiatives a boycott which has lead to them backtracking on said initiatives did that boycott not help russia more as you put it also again tractor supply is the proper noun of that company they dont actually supply tractors >its all old white dudes how are they supposed to implement a dei agenda sure lets just ignore the <number> black farmers in america and its just old white dudes they say you cant teach an old dog new tricks but maybe they can surprise us all and learn what the rest of the world already knows diversity brings better ideas innovation and guess what profits if they can figure out how to drive a tractor im pretty sure they can handle a dei agenda >the sad part about this is that my green agenda is being hijacked by the dei people now every culture war post ive seen attempts to lump together lowering carbon emissions with pride parades what the fuck what does an electric tractor have to do with sucking a ding dong nothing the russians exxon neoconservatives opec and everyone else against the green transition love the work agenda because it is the perfect boogeyman to associate climate action with okay this entire paragraph is just a rant but ill try to turn things into a constructive discussion in the glow of the light of this burning strawman youre worried that larry fink and blackrocks talk about diversity and the environment is somehow throwing a wrench in the works of going green but lets be real here having diverse voices isnt going to ruin the planet in fact it might actually help save it imagine this bringing in folks from all sorts of backgrounds leads to fresh ideas and creative solutions shocking right diversity and green practices arent like oil and water they actually mix quite well more diverse minds mean more innovation and guess what even more support for those fancy new electric tractors so yeah lets stop pretending diversity is some kind of kryptonite to progress keeping the same old dogs in the boardroom is going to result in the same old tricks women and people of color are more leftleaning and do you know which side supports the green agenda more spoilers it aint the right as for tractor supply boycotts are a legit way for folks to push for change when they see something wrong a lot of the comments in that post on witches vs patriarchy discussed shopping locally instead of using the chain tractor supply shopping local can support the community and may even reduce our environmental footprint that doesnt seem very prorussia to me in the end tractor supply caters to hobby farmers smallscale farmers and rural homeowners if youre really worried about agricultural production in the us boycotting tractor supply isnt going to phase it dupont pioneer and john deere they are not and now getting back to the original post i was commenting on >im thinking specifically about the witches vs patriarchy subreddit which seems to have been censoring proukraine content my personal experience hasnt supported this claim as they have been very proukraine from what ive seen which is why i was requesting examples,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMkliVWplMUlPOGNuMXVxeElRTjRTQnBRMG5xYUFMN0RKb2NnWWJQYllYSU95bk9BeDNFYndTZ01va3ZKRjFaVnI0c3VhZDRDUFpvdEhYU1hnQURzc3c9PQ==

bidens sole objective was to mend the soul of america after the charlottesville tiki torch march where white nationalists shouted jews will not replace us with his domestic policy agenda <number> colorblind union jobs would give those people replaced by globalization and offshoring the dignity of work for a livable wage they were invited to drop the tiki torch pick up a shovel and pursue the american dream and sure enough biden built back the manufacturing industry for chips solar panels building materials cars and sustainable farming that was previously offshored to china during neoliberal globalization the financial times calls it green nationalism and on paper it worked in theory then enters bidens advisors they ran some polls with focus groups and suggested that it wasnt enough bidens moderate appeal was losing support of the base in particular black voters in georgia the political calculus to give an olive branch to the tiki torchers wasnt enough to bolster bidens black support if anything eroded it the advisors argued now bidens advisors were telling him not only to ignore the original mending of the soul with a bipartisan unity approach but to actively pour jet fuel on the tiki torches with dei and woke rhetoric to appeal to the farleft democrat base bidens advisors hijacked the steering wheel and abandoned the bipartisan agenda in favor of the orange man bad agenda not only did this anger the farright but now the farleft calls him genocide joe for supporting israeli self defense so all of that political calculus from the inflation reduction act infrastructure bill and chips act creating jobs in red states wasted that is why newt gingrich said democrats dont know the cost of eggs in <number> the advisors erased any empathy for the disenfranchised and continued to demonize them as deplorable just like hillary clinton did the advisors wasted the sole purpose of the domestic policy agenda to mend the soul of the electorate and promote unity and for what cheap political oneliners designed to win georgia well now we lost pennsylvania apparently and wisconsin too great fucking job that being said trump is a mobster the people in his administration who didnt leave and denounce him were all mobsters even his donors but the people who voted for him were not mobsters they were just trying to feed their families the biden advisors dont understand this nuance so not only will biden lose the election due to his rapidly progressing parkinsons but he would have lost because his advisors manipulated him to abandon the sole purpose of his campaign empathize with the disenfranchised workers instead of calling them honest workers he called them ultramaga republicans to feed into the democrat base hysteria demonizing them as nazis for cheap political points so in summary yes having the russian and israeli mob run another trump administration is quite possibly a constitutional crisis but that doesnt mean the political rhetoric of the biden administration should be <number> orange man bad hysteria they are not nazisthey are hangry when they go low we go high those republicans are correct in their sentiment bidens rhetoric has become sensationalized race bait that divides us into usvsthem rather than bring the left and right together instead of unity of left and right they chose unity of the democratic base i say that as one of bidens original ghost writers but now they call him genocide joe so that was all wasted you can thank his advisors for fucking up my unity agenda if the shooter was in fact radicalized by this rhetoric and that orange man bad sentiment is confirmed to be his motive then you can absolutely thank those advisors for this as blowback of their hysterical rhetoric they called him an existential threat and some autist took it literally and treated him like one those words have meaning,r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadUttRkVkNE11NGtEZjBiSk5Ta0hVLUFPTEU1YUVVWmJvc0F3SURScjNDRV82TXFpTHJ5a3J0dFZUcFFHNVg3dnJyakJUOUhra0g1VGJBbDlQN1ZTNkE9PQ==
