the one thing which pakistani partnership would allow however is having relationships with both of the states sandwiching the wakhan corridor at the very least it would allow for a very defensable stronghold in light of its remoteness at the very most if china does come around to backing or building a road through wakhan the new trade resulting from that could be taxed the way some taliban taxed the ring road back in the day between those two ends of the spectrum a secure wakhan would provide a narrow but immediate front for expansion along the remainder of the tajik border i only worry about pakistan connecting with any resistance orgs as a sting operation to sell them out to the emirate,r/afghanconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjV3d4TG9HUmx1Nm1IdkxwaXhQWVUwV1Z3clhrcXhLYnlTR21MVHZZR0VYMzl5QjNpU0dUanZxNlluaEtrRGFJMmE2SGpXNENnaTdpSTF6eWN5THRjcVE9PQ==
assuming the allegation concerns the nrf aff and not iskp it would be the first time that pakistan chose the nonfanatical and nonpashtun side in the fight i think the bigger concern is whether this would be if true a sting operation on the part of the isi to get good with the taliban if not i only see this as an improvement especially if the leadership isnt going to switch out and no new groups seem to be forthcoming in the foreseeable future if nothing else any intensified nrf or aff activity could grant new groups the bandwidth to form beneath the emirates shadow,r/afghanconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOVU5cXk4M2JUZzlQVWxEZXhUSTY5X2J5bVpnNG1VelkxWFgwd1k3bm53eGdRaU96Vl9YWGJ4YWVhTWdvZEZjVzdyLXhjMUdjNFRFQ3RSejNySnduYWc9PQ==

okay yes you are correct didnt think of that example since it was before the soviet war but still true at the same time id argue that was before pakistan concocted the formula of backing the craziest islamists they could as a hope to salt the earth against indian influence sure the emirates obstinence in cracking down on ttp on its side of the border may be the occasion for the isi to reevaluate this decades long strategy all the same this wouldnt just be a tweak in policy but the shuttering of an entire directorate and numerous careers spent maintaining ties with the taliban owing to that could be a chance that even if protaliban personalities didnt originate this outreach as a sting operation they may lobby to coopt it as such to betray the nrfaff or even just be in position to leak intelligence to the emirate again not impossible but i would hope amrullah saleh is adamantly cautioning both groups against revealing too much to pakistan,r/afghanconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bHRSUjBadmRHM3BwMG1tQUt2VDhZbUtjV3pOUWJoWnowMW5BWm4wOXVfaGpiR2JUWkgtVHNWVTVfWUFjYjNVa1VsSlhpbEZNemlDRnZtaVdOVDBPMkE9PQ==
