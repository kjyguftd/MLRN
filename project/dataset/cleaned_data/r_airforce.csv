youve created a false dilemma by suggesting that we shouldnt encourage integrity unless everyone in the air force perfectly lives up to that standard those arent mutually exclusive in fact it would be meaningless to use integrity as a core value if we could be sure everyone would live by it we dont use dont commit murder as a core value its assumed that is already understood and largely not something anyone would consider doing by highlighting integrity as a core value we are not only claiming that it is integral to how we want to be as a group but also insinuating that it is something that is optional in daily life and requires effort to truly live by none of this is diminished by the current trends in how we write epbs although it is fair to highlight the contradiction,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdW9lTHFpREllcS1ZQTU5c2xocm56ejlSZXNvY2JpSVBWY3lscVhWZWRtQ2dNX2ZnemlNdmNGRU8wQUk1ektaeTN3ZmJsSXhKSlZ4eFpxZnZfdlZKSTBaQXhYZDFkWURkdHJTOEdZWDBoZms9

ok check it out they just got picked up which means they havent done the job yet means they also dont know what its like good for them i hope they love it you were talking in another comment about how there are so many hoops to jump through to get to another unitmission those are there by design to weed out the people who dont have the grit to persevere and jump through the hoops to get where they want to go if you want it jump through the hoops its your attitude that is toxic and maybe thats because your bad leadership has been poisoning you another commenter spoke with you and thinks youre in a shitty unit which does suck if your leadership where you are located sucks you could work on finding a mentor who does your same job and is higher in rank a tsgt or higher would be great this person can help you out with a records review to advise you on how you compare to your peers objectively one of the best chiefs i ever had did this for me and he let me know i wasnt as cool as i thought i was this allowed me to reassess what i was doing and focus my energy on tasks and initiatives that would actually set me apart so i could be competitive to get what i wanted if you cant get to your dream unit right now maybe just a different unit would be a good move so that you can get some local leadership that will advocate for you and help you get what you want if you humble yourself and seek out help from someone doing the job you want who has some more experience than you do you can probably make some progress toward doing the stuff you want to do without having to go over to the army and be treated like shit if you keep that attitude of how youre so much better than all the ns around you youre going to have a hard time finding the mentor who will want to give you the guidance and advice you want and need,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUjJCMTNDcUF2NUVKMDNoU0loNWhfOHUtRk11b2ZSZ1g1NWx5b1pkbGZ1cUZwMFNxN1kySE9YdkJsQnN2T3dJelZSMktseXJPWnZyZVZYbXFpaVVwQU1GXzR1MENybndnYjRHLWtzSnNkMHc9

some good recommendations here but what you must do is follow the assignment cycles view the available assignments and apply for those assignmentsdepending on your career field amsvmpf or myvectortalent market place this will keep you listing the most current assignment on the top of your list additionally you need to periodically check the list of equal plus jobs you can only have one application in for this at a time so make sure to follow dates closely some less known info on these is that you can apply for certain other career fields as well postal courier academy instructor check frequently as these arent on the same standard cycle another option is to engage with your supervisory chain about a dsd assignment these are special duties recruiter mti mtl they will have certain pre requisites and require your supervisions support final thought i see a lot of concern on here about bad supervision and i see it in the field as well but everywhere i have been i have seen at least one decent person in the leadership team know that they are open to trying to help you you just have to communicate a need for help best of luck to you i was stuck at my first base for <number> years and didnt get any traction untill i started doing the above,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS1g4TlFEb3EyZXZsb3lpSDRtZnowT2lpRE8wY1B6ZWJaRjYwVjF2OFNTZ3lZRDFSXzh4OVM4VFNJbm9UTnhLbTF5UWtEVU81Z0stREhEZUNabS16ZHc9PQ==

itd be more eo than ig but the issue is unless its explicitly its very hard to pin down leadership having a general negative perception of you and that having an impact can be far more difficult to actually prove than it might seem as shitty as it is and its a huge reason why i think this archaic stance against beards is so ridiculous if someone truly believes beards are unprofessional when they see someone like me with a waiver theres no way they suddenly think but hes fine if you actually think its unprofessional i dont believe me having a waiver stops those people from still viewing me or others with waivers negatively and this dissuades a lot of people especially on the o side from pursuing one its stupid as fuck,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYlZ6Vm9JdlBmQUhYMF9KWk9oaXRmbEo5MVlIWnJITFBmU3VfVnlqczBpN3l1T2hhVDB0NEE4ZThlRjhhS29XTGNfMjcxMENDaHVDcDEyeHBKd1I2alE9PQ==

i agree that you can make the most out of every assignment based on what you do however comma i have a different spin on the phrase from the perspective and experience of an army companygrade officer the assignments you get are the ones you fight for im an army lt at an air force base attached to a three star command that is an experience that i only know two other army lts have had the opportunity to take part of this has gotten me multiple development opportunities to set me apart from peers it does suck because my first year here i had no friends as even captains were few and far between there were no other army lts to hang out with but being able to hop in a training exercise with security forces introduced me to other air force lts and since then ive been in good company and have learned a lot about the air force and their operations considerations and planning through casual hang outs now im in the running for a joint soc assignment in a support role of course im not that high speed just because i responded to an email if anyone was interested in the job not many people responded i guess all that to say you gotta make assignments that you can make the most out of,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ0xuaWZsWDltTkZXN1hlU2ZVWmZIemRDOS13aHBqZWFZRU1hREhBeEtEUjFpdkYtVHNuYnNqR1lsQS1ZRVprbENjcU00SkViaDFsYWxXWUVvNEZFU0E9PQ==

first things first the air force has an officer program for nursing super competitive but very rewarding if you can get into that second do not understand any circumstance join as an enlisted member if you are smart enough to obtain a bachelors in biology you are smart enough to get hired elsewhere finally you are better off building up some experience before going for your graduate degree if you try to go straight in a graduate program without any experience what ends up happening is you learn a lot of overarching concepts but are not able to apply them in the workplace because you must have a the experience to do so and b the job position that allows it so it becomes knowledge that rots away worst case scenario go into the guard or reserves as an officer and inch your way into ad as an officer but for the love of god do not go enlisted with a bachelors degree,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU2QzSVV0UU4tOV9kaVkxN2h5XzJ2ODdZbldmTFRoRTNxS1BrZDV6cmYya3BTeXJqZ3pvOFRQY0pvMzNQSmZfYkd3b1B5dXNETWhMajJFUm9kYTllWEE9PQ==

there is certainly something to it my personality a negative work environment will weigh on me more and more after a while no matter what the area is like i loved where i was stationed in germany but i was absolutely miserable full disclosure i had a lapse of sanity and went af to army which turned out to be a bad idea regardless of how hooah i was it really had me depressed and i didnt enjoy as much of germany and europe as i should have i almost find shittier baseslocations that its collectively agreed upon it is can make for a better experience as some try to make up for it of course it just takes one person somewhere up the chain to ruin it but the potential is there but it really comes down to your own ability to make the best of it i cant fake it or lie to myself about realities but some can i can keep it inside for the most part so it doesnt become a toxic virus that spreads around the work center and makes it mentally worse for everyone but i try to make it as fun as possible for my and others sake laughing through tragedy might not be the most healthy thing but its kept me from ctrl+alt+deleting my way out and you could argue thats the most important thing theres always something positive that can be found and experienced even at the worst assignment it certainly may not feel like it at the time but reflecting back its at least a character building experience ive had several experiences in my military career that it was the last straw and i was done and getting out like were talking to the point i was about to ruin my career and make someone cry that you definitely shouldnt do and i didnt care especially at the point in my career and rank but i got through and even can laugh about the experience on the other side one i even trauma bonded with the team i was in charge of and stayed in contact even though we all are all over the place now and some of it were holy shit moments we did that we overlooked some of the cool shit that was happening because of the dumpster fire we were in simultaneously hard to experience when you do something that might be a bit more boring and mild mannered but sometimes that might mean you need to apply for something that could shake things up ive been in a while and theres nothing that wasnt apart of a bigger assignment that there wasnt something cool or fun or worthwhile out of it even if my feelings were fuck this place or fuck that unit at the time and maybe a little to this day and i almost ctrl+alt+deleted at one of them,r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnREJsRFlYdElZdXluOEhMTkEwZ2UtN05TMzFuanl2NTE3Q3RjZTRZNVB0Z0trX1Z0ZEVqVk5qbWxRcGcyUjJzUFhNSTFRMThIdWdqWXRlWWZiVmQ1bVE9PQ==
