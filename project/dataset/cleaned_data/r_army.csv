this may be true but at a certain point you are a soldier you are given benefits even from one contract that many people would do anything for the least you can do is maintain a albeit very low physical standard htwt is a pretty outdated metric for physical fitness but if youre consistently getting a <number> on acft and failing htwt you are out of a shape when it comes to actually failing acfts maybe im an asshole but i think soldiers should be kicked out more aggressively for acft failure <number> is the absolute bare minimum and if you workout for like an hour once a week you can pass the acft im not talking about failures because someone tried to deadlift <number> and fucked the form up but their overall score was like <number> without the deadlift failure the bare minimum standard is so achievable that soldiers have no excuse to consistently fail besides laziness,r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZVFzOEU0b1M2TEoxekRpbHVjeDlUVzl0bDFQY3RjZFVGVklnYXJIQkwtMGxoeF8zT1BTcjVnYkJPWkpWOFhILVFtVUZKRFFiRHhNUnYtazdXOFh2Vnc9PQ==
i can get that sentiment with regard to the acft but with regard to hw id frankly disagree unless the soldiers blatantly fat enough to make comparisons to the michelin man im not going to care if somebodys ten pounds over the max weight limit or is a few percent over the max body fat percentage especially if they can pass an acft with scores that arent just barely skating by considering the careerists in the military seem to enjoy going overboard with treating anybody that cant meet a certain weight rangebody measure like shit arguably the folks that come in underweight get treated even worse than the overweight folks for god knows what reason even if they are also sometimes guilty of it makes me think the sole purpose of the hw portion of testing is to make sure soldiers look fit and not actually be fit nevermind how soldiers are willing to and often encouraged to game the system by either dehydrating themselves before a hw test or solely do neck and shoulder exercises to pass the tape test to pass,r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYjRyUm1EODM1N0hfVE1RaEVVbjFvdmR4SkRVVktPWEwydUVGRlpWTGlBd29NTUYtTnp6a0hlclNGYkNVV2phaGJhMk5RT0RjdkJHNjY3SEJWYzFjVmc9PQ==

first off airtight counseling air tight being the operative word here dont put anything to paper that tds can pick apart counsel them list who stole where they stole what they stole and when they stole it list each regulation they broke let them know they may be recommended for an article <number> due to this event impose no further punishment ie smoking tds can say the soldiers already received corrective action if you do inform the soldiers on whats to come first theyll be given a reading stating whether or not theyve been recommended for article <number> where they should be informed of their rights however you can inform them of their rights during said counseling just in case next theyll be contacted by legal counsel and should draft a statement then revisions will be recommended by their counsel which they should listen to next they wait until the hearing once it comes they stand before an article <number> board at the end they can choose to appeal via court martial considering the px is really good when it comes to evidence i wouldnt suggest they take that route figure out why they stole seriously get to the bottom of it not just the i dunno sarn i jus wasnt thinkin bullshit then if you for some reason want to save their asses try to get every leader in their coc to right letters of good character however the commander amd the sg cannot right those due to conflict this may help them get a reduced punishment for now tell the soldiers they fucked up and due so calmly amd professionally the worst kind of trouble you can be in when it comes to the army is the trouble you dont get yelled at for let them stew in it hopefully the time between now and the decision of the article board will be more of a punishment mentally them the actual punishment good luck,r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYkliMy1TLTFWQVkxSERPTWhYcHhTYmtlVzdId3dDRHlxUlNpQnhORnNMbUtxNjY3bFNETTRKZ3pONktCVFE0Wi1UbHV1dmxzWUVvVFNjQy1lUnJ1eVE9PQ==

you should definitely counsel them at the least but i would use the counseling session less like an interrogation and waterboard and more like a conversation to understand why they felt the need to do it are they buying staple items cause they cant afford food for the barracks are they bored do they come from an environment where stealing isnt that frowned upon is this something that more than just these two soldiers are doing a lot of people in the comments are saying article <number> etc etc i think we tend to forget that as leaders we have an obligation to both discipline but also to educate and mentor we want to create forward thinking integral soldiers who enjoy being in the army not just peons who fear the boot and get up to no good anytime someone isnt looking i think counseling and understanding is a first step then move on to keeping these soldiers gainfully employed take them under your wing put them into details that will teach them something put them in charge of teaching other soldiers it takes a village so bring in other trusted leaders or junior enlisted to provide them mentorship and work too if they dont get their shit together then move on to the harsher punishments,r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhb1FvYUJfaERrSFlsUFJ4UzZzaFNnOVp5ZVFDQVlTQWFmS2UxS2l4LVlfa2NGQzBtLUtsMlZ2MWFkMl9SbDQwRVR0cnBxT0FPbGFqLXR4TVZINDhLLU9sQ3ZHTURVd3pxci1CMGJGM3FKalU9
