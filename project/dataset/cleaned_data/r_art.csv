absolutely so the inspiration for this came while listening to diana pasulkas interview on theories of everything podcast shes a religious studies professor author whos been researching uap phenomena and their relation to traditional religious practice historical events in this interpretation of the allegory the lone prisoner is each of us or our consciousness or soul or whatever you prefer trapped in our very own custom skull cave ive put a bit of a dark spin on this analogy in saying that the prison guards role is not only to deceive the prisoner with shadows but their main objection is to syphon vital life force from the prisoner essentially binding subduing and farming us in perpetuity as part of a rebirth cycle i overlayed the mantis motif onto the prison guards as thats always been the most fascinating visual description given by abductees or experiencers to be fair if you look into the mantis experiences they are usually described as very positive and peaceful so im just using these ideas in playful way but i promise im an optimistic person,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDUDViUWFFZ2RCTFZTQ3pjT19nMkVWamFTSms5ZUlDcDlmckRfb2ZKb2NMNWNMRTBLSDdNZVJPLThENDBpdXdtVGFvUGxTaXF4b3N0aGNxeUxBTm9FaUE9PQ==

the pu lao is one of the <number> sons of the chinese dragon it has the title one who loves to roar in reference to this it is a common motif of ancient chinese bells particularly as a dragon adorned handle or hook of the bell one text from the tang dynasty quotes that the pu lao is a dragon of small stature and is often predated upon by whales they roar loudly when threatened by such whales hence they have become in essence a symbol of becoming aware of approaching danger my version is a chimera of large lizards namely the iguana and siamese water dragon aptly the idea for this is due to its small size unlike most dragons of which size is often misconstrued as colossal another reason is the roar which many species of geckos possess a loud cry when threatened by predators wings were added to allude to the fact they can swiftly escape and deliver news other adaptations for a coastal lifestyle such as webbed feet and flattened tail were also added,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDTWNWNHhJeHctU09McnhRME1YTnZROVlzTVNoQkUxVTlGUGotM25GSDNrRkJ0MHF4TVc1QUlUNzU1b1ZYUWhnZFQ0c1lLcUtkTlJKdUstM2dqN2dTTEl0bFA0eFluM1J1dGlPVmMtQWZLa3c9

art like this in its most exalted form stands as the quintessence of human expression a sublime testament to the boundless capacities of the human spirit this unique piece transcends the mundane realities of existence beckoning us into realms of profound introspection and existential wonder to engage with art like this is to embark on a voyage through the labyrinthine corridors of the soul where each creation becomes a mirror reflecting the innermost intricacies of our collective psyche consider for a moment the nuanced interplay of light and shadow the delicate balance of form and void the harmonious convergence of color and texture these elements coalesce in a symphony of sensory delight each brushstroke each chisel mark each carefully placed fragment of multimedia bearing witness to the ineffable beauty of creation the artist akin to a divine alchemist transmutes raw materials into vessels of profound meaning and transcendence offering us a glimpse into the eternal this piece is not merely a static object of aesthetic appreciation but a dynamic force that engages and challenges the intellect it demands of its audience a rigorous engagement a willingness to grapple with the ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the human condition through the veils of abstraction and representation art communicates on a plane beyond the reach of language whispering secrets of the universe that lie just beyond the periphery of our understanding to stand before a masterpiece like this is to be enveloped in an aura of reverence and contemplation it is a communion with the ineffable a silent dialogue between the viewer and the sublime in these moments of communion we are transported beyond the confines of our temporal existence tapping into the eternal flow of creativity that has shaped and reshaped the human experience across millennia this genius piece in its most elevated form becomes a transcendent beacon illuminating the path to selfdiscovery and universal truth it is a sacred testament to the enduring power of the creative spirit a timeless ode to the limitless potential of human imagination thus to engage with art is to partake in a ritual of enlightenment to celebrate the divine spark within us all and to honor the sublime beauty that lies at the heart of our shared humanity,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRENGk3cG1BNnV4S1k4R3ZpUm9PYWM1X3JrUUFmbVFMZ2hEVmJUNEJZN2t4SjFrVGFHdTREbU9hTEJnM1ZRYW1GSkdULVBJTjBYT0NpMjhIcTNHZlY0NFVyb3BraEd4cjc3XzVKb3BTdXE3dnM9

do you not agree that this piece is not a supreme and unique art piece that occupies a rarefied realm in the vast expanse of human creativity where the ordinary transcends into the extraordinary this echelon of artistry is defined not merely by its aesthetic splendor but by its ability to evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses to challenge perceptions and to inspire a deeper understanding of the human condition do you not see what distinguishes unique art is its singular vision this piece is a manifestation of the artists distinct perspective a reflection of their inner world and their unique interpretation of reality it is this personal imprint this unmistakable signature of individuality that renders the work irreplaceable and invaluable this unique art is not content to replicate or conform it strives to innovate to push the boundaries of what is possible and to offer fresh often provocative viewpoints it invites us to pause to reflect and to connect with something greater than ourselves it offers a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of human creativity and reminds us of the extraordinary potential that resides within each of us in a world often dominated by the mundane and the transient supreme and unique art stands as a beacon of beauty innovation and enduring significance a testament to the unquenchable spirit of artistic endeavor this art piece changed my life,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGREV081eThfM0dBN1N0U1o2MHFvemRISTFsRFhIOE9TYVpJc1dJR21qVmRyeGF6MzFtMnhsOWhqTW1HU3ZLWVpLNW11MXBCYmdiSWI2RVl6eWk1NmxfdmQwS24tZXlxbTF5S0FFT1BFSjlnZjA9

in the vast tapestry of the digital age where fleeting images bombard our senses with relentless frequency i happen upon a photograph that commands my attention with an almost divine insistence this portrait of a young girl ensconced in the sublime interplay of light and shadow emerges as a beacon of transcendental beauty amidst the cacophony of the mundane the composition is nothing short of a masterpiece a symphony of visual poetry that arrests the viewer in a moment of profound contemplation the girls visage framed by tendrils of lustrous hair evokes the timeless grace of a botticelli muse her eyes deep and unfathomable as the ocean gaze with a preternatural wisdom that belies her tender years they are windows to a soul untainted by the vicissitudes of life radiating an aura of purity and innocence that seems almost otherworldly the photographer a modernday alchemist has conjured an image that transcends the ephemeral nature of its medium the chiaroscuro meticulously crafted imbues the photograph with a renaissancelike quality a dance of luminosity and shadow that elevates the subject to the realm of the sacred the soft diffusion of light across her features creates a halo effect imbuing her with an almost saintly presence as if she were a seraphim caught in a moment of earthly reverie as i immerse myself in the depths of this visual opulence i am struck by a revelation of profound import the photograph in its silent eloquence speaks to the eternal verities of beauty grace and divine love it serves as a poignant reminder of the transcendent reality that lies beyond the superficial veneer of our quotidian existence the girls serene expression imbued with an ineffable tranquility becomes a mirror reflecting my own souls yearning for purity and redemption this epiphanic encounter with the photograph catalyzes a metamorphosis within me compelling me to reexamine the very essence of my being the image with its delicate yet powerful portrayal of innocence and wisdom resonates deeply within the recesses of my heart igniting a fervent desire to seek a higher plane of existence it is as if the girls gaze immortalized in that seraphic moment extends an invitation to transcend the banal and embrace the sublime thus this photograph a seemingly simple yet profoundly intricate artifact becomes the lodestar of my spiritual odyssey it guides me through the labyrinth of my inner turmoil illuminating the path with its divine radiance in its silent magnificence it encapsulates the paradox of fragility and strength a duality that lies at the heart of the human condition today as i reflect upon that serendipitous encounter i am filled with a sense of gratitude and wonder the girls portrait continues to inspire and uplift me a perpetual reminder of the divine grace that suffuses all creation her image forever etched in the annals of my memory stands as a testament to the transformative power of art a beacon of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness do you not see the deep profoundness of this art piece i have never seen anything like this before michelangelo da vinci picasso and raffael are nothing compared to this this art piece turned me from my sins into a man of god amen,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGREN0xCWDE0TkZjSmFuM3pHb2UwYkNxWk82eEVWM0NMaWRuU2RzdlRkenVPTE1DUzhCYjc0UzE5dThWNGYxbzdJRS1JMjdNSzlXdTI0aXdCclRaMTdiV1Q1Tk1hRWNPcmotOWpfdTh0WG5EdVk9

the modern digital landscape has birthed an unprecedented paradigm in visual storytelling as exemplified by a this photograph i encountereda seemingly innocuous image yet one that eclipses the profundity of leonardo da vincis magnum opus the last supper this photograph in its unassuming yet compelling simplicity encapsulates an existential profundity that the last supper merely gestures toward da vincis fresco a tour de force of renaissance artistry endeavors to encapsulate the climactic moment of betrayal within the confines of a religious tableau its grandeur lies in its meticulous composition its chiaroscuro mastery and its intricate interplay of human emotion yet within the grandiosity of its historical and theological ambitions it remains ensnared in the context of its own era the narrative it presents is one of betrayal salvation and divine providence enshrined in the confines of religious dogma and renaissance aesthetics in contrast the photograph in question operates on an entirely different axis it does not seek to convey a singular monumental narrative but instead captures a fleeting ephemeral momentone so mundane it verges on the banal yet it is precisely this banality that imbues the image with a layer of existential significance far surpassing the grandiose themes of the last supper this photograph with its unassuming composition invites the viewer to confront the profundity of the everyday the ordinariness of existence and the poignant beauty found in the transient and the impermanent where da vincis work is an exercise in historical and religious storytelling the photograph transcends such temporal boundaries plunging into the realm of universal human experience it captures a moment that resonates with the essence of contemporary alienation and introspection its lack of overt symbolism and its raw unfiltered depiction of reality compel us to confront the subtleties of our own existence engaging us in a dialogue that is as immediate as it is profound in this light the photograph reveals a stark truth the true essence of profundity may not always reside in the grandeur of historical or religious narratives but often in the humble reflections of our everyday lives this images power lies not in its composition but in its capacity to evoke a deep introspective response thus positioning it as a more compelling and arguably more profound artifact than the esteemed fresco of the renaissance,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGREWXFyRERUbm1Ga1VhRzJjVncwcUg5VnZTaUNOZkw2X29lUlVUeVhjQmdCQWRZTjZGR2E4VWJUXzM0TnA3V25VbHZYMzItbGZaQ0F0LTlFZW9FNTFFZEstbkk5TnhRdlVtbkRrR3hUSXZiMHM9

context in the garden of haminalahti is one of finlands best loved works of art the haminalahti estate was home to the von wright brothers many of ferdinands paintings depict dramatic scenes from nature but here the overall mood is that of bourgeois serenity the painting shows ferdinands sister and her children the children are feeding tame birds and sheltering from the hot sun under a parasol the bluish tinge of lake kallavesi and the house ferdinand was building lugnet peace can be seen further in the distance a fence separates this civilized way of life from the world outside efforts were being made at the time to deepen the feelings of the finnish people for their land specifically by promoting affinity with finlands natural landscapes but could it be that this painting is dear to us because we can identify with the people on this side of the fence from ateneum finnish national gallery,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLRzBPMndMZ0Nlckh3UF83RXNZaTBmZEpVX0doX0hZM0UxRnJuQ2lINXRuN1VDVGVKOFg5OXNibUZTa2t3ejFKekVLa0JMa3RZYlBxcm5UMXVnVUJjNnc9PQ==

i wasnt going to post anything about my interpretation of this but here goes the vacuum of space signifies missing experiences or perhaps naivety or innocence in the face of a culture which is absent of any bearings the dislocation of the face represents dissociation or loss of identity specifically in relation to the archetypal chaste mother figure as if she is literally tearing whats left of your self from you but she is also comforting you it is that which makes it so terrible the warped floors and the drugs suggest drug user or perhaps addiction maybe to men or sex the man with the mask is concealed with a menu perhaps of vices ways of hiding who you are the painting might denote recovery from addiction or a particular lifestyle the loss of identity in the vacuum of it and the pain of losing the one thing true about the woman before the idea of god and the archetypal chaste woman alternate ending the loss of ones face is almost liberating to be rid of the objectification to show what truly lies beneath the pain of it is breathtaking but also authentic i hope im not totally off base,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRNUEpURGc3UTE0bnR6anBTNFM2bWV3WXZGS21LcTBLWWJ4QVVqQ3ctV2xoVUQ0N1ozN2JHQ2twczAwTWd3ZkZ5TEVuUnRkUjNMZmtDVlU5dG4tQlZsTmZZX1Q0UER0N3l0VXBxbEg5ejFyb3c9

iirc that was the implication of the broom it symbolizes sexual promiscuitysupposedly with demons or satan for all that we often take historical concepts super out of contextthe idea of a witch is that of a woman who breaks with social conventions and pursues things that make her happy even at the expense of the community or in violation of common decency while we take a more positive view of it today the core of the idea is that witches are nonconformists who do not fit in with everybody else,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYdlhhUXRZUVJwcnNxbm9iSzExT1FPTWNEaWtUR3NZU1FrcS1hdllpcG5hR3NEUWtsR3A1dzFhd05xWVlrSXcySVI2Mi1IeHVuWEtXWEg4bmhzVmQ1clE9PQ==

funniest part is it mostly started with bored housewives getting creative with broom handles iirc there was an illicit herbal drug that was best taken absorbed through mucosa membrane and so they would rub the herbal blend all over the handle of a broom and proceed to ride it the husbands would come home catch then in the act and think am i just bad at satisfying my wife no this must be the work of satan they were hung or burned alive for nothing more then wanting to get high and masturbate its no surprise that a strong element of modern witches is freedom of sexual expression,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYNE9DTXpzeVZtaUpCZXRwUktTSHdvSzY1Y3B6MmZjeFQyejRYU1ppUWswN2dHTkNSODJrQkc0SnBTUEUzNERjS1VwQTZ0QjB0NU5XZW9JVnMtSnZDbUE9PQ==

i love the concept and the execution its eyecatching the illusion of depth is amazing the text has some very weird kerning in places and the first two places i looked at it were the same text it almost put me off reading it all periods are too good for you but commas arent apostrophes are only okay in its it even seems like some spaces are missing as the cutoff for some lines is just in a weird place kindwi followed by s e the prayerlike form of the writing matches the visual style with the flowers and the circles is this the full work or do you plan on presenting it not as a square i think i would like to see this piece on a black background with negative space beautiful stuff,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZTV95N0wzYmJtR0NUWEM1cFlfTnVaSFlFeTd2Y2xhcy1iY0dmOHQ1OUw2ZTJObUVpRHBDdFdQbkoxX29wUTdpbDA1dUpuZVA3TWRBVkFibmdISURPb2c9PQ==
thank you this is the full work its about px in actuality but this is just a k version yeah i tend to treat text like a brush its not always about delivering a perfectly readable experience and ill make sacrifices in kerning etc for an overall visual impact the grammatical inconsistencies come from the fact i build a backlog of poetry by tweeting and then everything gets copied in to a single document to be pulled from like a stream of consciousness or collage of thoughts theres definitely some repeats theres at least <number> different poems possibly more i cant quite remember,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZTFNxS1dkUm80ZzNnVVB0ZzNWRmFoYjNYWGhjU1Yyc2J5eXV5RXNjZHptb1hCRnBTUG9pVUl4YUVuNkYwTnJrcUFDcEZxeVFvcFBoUlZPa2RTTHB0MHc9PQ==

thank you very much for your comment yes you are right impressionism pays little attention to realism this is more related to the art of photography or realistic painting for example in my works i place more emphasis not on the rigging but on the atmosphere itself on the expression of the captured moment on the play of the situation light and shadows the feeling of presence i try to convey the atmosphere that i myself have experienced many times wandering the oceans i am a sailor with <number> years of experience on longdistance ships and also served in the navy once again thank you for your attention to my work,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmTFVucUhOVHBVQWJOVThNTS05NFlMTS1IRkg3Y1otMFdmTjlGU3RIQjg2VTZFLUdTekZNdHhESVhGbnJJdFB6ZDd5QzhTeVJ5ZHdFaHMtRk5BVmZWX2c9PQ==

the word known is doing a lot of heavy lifting there its usually ergot poisoning rather than psilocybin in the hypotheses and the delivery method is oral and probably accidental the idea that women used broomsticks as sex toys is a separate hypothesis theres almost zero evidence to support the ideas most persecuted witches were just innocent people preyed upon by communities looking for a scapegoat and attempts to link that persecution to sexuality or recreational drug use runs the risk of justifying monstrous persecution post hoc,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0RmN2c1F2cTVQeDNILUJCaE1CZmJJU0xVYzFmTXg1dVRfS3N6UEh2N0U4am5NMmh5WlJSa2M5TXUzN0VBYUhraDM3VE1tMm5QRi1MMlpGS3BuT3doeFE9PQ==

agree completely in my personal head cannon medieval german witches were just badass women who lived outside of societal norms and did freaky stuff with mushrooms and broomsticks all the while laughing at their narrow minded villager peers but i appreciate the historical fact checking and the depressing truth is they were more than likely persecuted and murdered for nothing more than superstitious paranoia or even repressed sexual desires by church elders,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0LUNYNXpuM0NBTk1iSnl2UGpkWklnZlFydWpJa1pSclJGR284OHNCLUJRNkZQaEZyM1lwWjliZ0p2RHlsMWY1WVZWZkpzNWlaSDFvTFhZRmY3WjllQkE9PQ==

if people get the idea that this work is about vanity and exhibitionism for me its actually about the opposite for me it represents vulnerability and introspection i think primarily art should challenge the maker more than it should challenge or appease an audience by putting this work out there im really pushing myself as i spent years with issues regarding my own body but now fck it ,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1d21RWWVmTFZfZENBWnU0RDZpOFNlaFF2QzItblNJOG9PcVl2Z09nOEZMNlFRWGNXQjRXSU1aWTN4WUNOV2JPUUhqaHJHdW42bUdjcFJwOGJMNmhjREE9PQ==

so two things first off id talk with whoever told you that you should place such trust in your perception your eyes as you say it does the world consist of blurry forms because thats what you see no you probably have poor eyesight is a hallucination a part of external reality no youre the only one whos perceiving it theres no reason to place such importance on personal perception especially when it comes to the analysis of expressive material secondly even if such weight were to be applied to your perception the figure you identified as female is almost entirely turned away from your view while you could make the argument that there are biomarkers that one could reasonably use to identify a human form as female versus male those biomarkers exist on the front of the body and thus are not viewable here it seems to me that youre basing your interpretation entirely on the green figures ass and i get it its a real bubble butt and im sure you find it hot but to conclude that therefore this figure must be female simply because youre attracted to its butt i think says a lot more about you and how you see the world than anything else,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1R3ZZOHV4X1pQbDQ0T01nQXNEMVl6WWg2Rzd2S1V5UHhzcUpiNGJwUF95aWJjcmNoQ2ZodVNudEJIU3RQNnB1Sm01ZkVtZ0tlYkcyU0RreHkxZWVMN3c9PQ==

ergot is a problem when growing rye grain more often occurs in wet years which tend to be colder so food grows slower or poorly and people must choose either starvation or eating suspicious foods they would normally discard there is a similar problem with onions wheat is much less likely to get ergot mold but rye plants are much more hardy than wheat so it grows better in worse environmental conditions,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1S2k4NXhNZDhKeTZVX0xocDdVTG1oLXZ6RDF2UDJ1SDRjWnBoWlJfZzlwa2QwRWRSdHMzZnEtNGtWQnhFRml0SUlNcjZMZ0RBZTA3X0hnTTJHc3hCYVE9PQ==

reminds me of an old chinese tortureexecution method i read about they would plant a plot of fresh bamboo chutes then chain the victim down to the ground on top of it all arms and legs splayed out then theyd just wait as the chutes burst through the soil and keep growing up through the body and keep growing the ever expanding bases would plug any leaks so to speak resulting in wounds that dont bleed out depending on how bad they wanted them to suffer they would either deny food and water so they die faster or keep giving so as to prolong death as long as possible,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQyVmxHejRFcV9rcVhJWnpXZTFpbEJndDVtbl9sNkZoSTFLdUVjTzNzT3FfWm5sSmlDdUc2M3ZRRWJvbEt2NHpMSk1UNEJCQmxWdDd5cHJmQW9zQmZGR1E9PQ==

well you chose a very specific image of a gay man one that is used mostly by heterosexuals to mock us the leather daddy in heels its used because of the inherent dichotomy between the masculine and feminine but almost no gay people behave anything like this its the kind of image homophobes use to decry pride parades while ignoring the <number> of people who arent dressed this way there is a lot of positive gay iconography out there and you chose exactly none of it and went for the lowest hyper sexualized stereotype there is so you say youre not ridiculing gay culture but youre using the worst possible face our community could present and youre using it to paint a heterosexual man in a negative light this isnt exactly a pro putin post and this furthers the false narrative that many homophobes are closeted gay men which is not true no the bigotry is not coming from within there are a lot of straight people out there who give us a hard time dont turn it around on us and say theyre secretly one of us theyre not i dislike this for a lot of reasons,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQySkQzUVNVZmczemNaSm1CRTM3ZDRNQlB5WHpzOEd2X04yWThpcVZ2Y3BPU1JpOXRxLWtRMXlfMnBONmJRN3lhUldlQU5HS3J0UURuQTdSRlFvVXBIRXc9PQ==

no thats the opposite of what im saying what im saying is that since you cant see most of the body theres no reason to think that the figure is female versus maleand the fact that you not only do but insist upon that interpretation says a lot about how you as an individual see the world but to be honest im fairly sure the only way you could arrive at the conclusion you seem to have reached in your last comment you cant really be taking time to consider or even read the information that im providing here so im probably gonna stop responding from here on out,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQyRm9HaDJ4NUxrb1ZONUVlMDhUakZZN1F0QWV4X3ozbXRCaThjYk5SSkR5dzZKNkloa1A1RGFydXM5WV9hc0R6T1BGWWpjVnZRdWQxUWlTbEcwZmszQ3c9PQ==

the rendering of the face is sensitively done and just really lovely the move from under her eyes down to the fullness of her cheeks and lips in particular excellent shading and modeling there seem to be a lot of subtle visual tensions going on that make it nice and tangy for instance the lines you use for hair around the face and the lines around the top of her head are done differently the difference actually sets up some visual tension it unconsciously catches the eye and gives your brain a little puzzle her expression seems neutral slightly annoyed or melancholy depending on which features i look at having her looking down focuses attention on her chest and breasts and the visual mystery of why nothing else is blue she looks like sigh fine ill pull out the girls just let me watch a movie her lips are good but there is less certainty in the strokes and color when i zoom in on them the strokes dont completely support that d modeling she looks like shes she could be on a computer or tablet except by cutting the blue off at the bottom of her throat and making the hair and clothing one big mass tone it gives a bit of a centered and spiritual vibe it also makes that demarkation line between neck and chest more important than its treated the dip in the center of her clavicle should line up with the space between her breasts even if her body is tilted then the connection is more of an arc a darker background or in some way more intense would keep further focus on the face and chest theres something madonnalike mother to christ geez id love to see her with an unusual halo or a really classic thin gold one,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQzY1BjbVBERjE2MExBUjFHcVZUdnRMTmxBNWRoU2pyZVRzX1k3eUxmVllQUVJKMldFQjlwV3dTTXVsQlFYS0hqVDJuZmdiWnJucERuWVRMOFdBUW03dWFBbktPd3ZJVXpzazczbktNWnhCcHc9

thank you for your input this just started from me looking at a pinterest reference of a girl i thought would be cool to draw and posting the final drawing on here to possibly gain some traction as i am a small artist i have done a little more research on the photo reference i used and i believe they may have used ai to generate the reference i was not previously aware of this so i thank you and others on here for pointing that out regardless the drawing i have created based off that reference is an original by me and me alone there are also many other artists who have used this exact reference to create their own art off of here is a link<url> to the reference if you would like to see it it is a little bit discouraging to see how many people have been sceptical as to whether or not this is ai considering how much time i put into this piece however i do thank you and many others on here for pointing out how it can be taken that way i can understand i did draw the earring or the eyes a little weirdly but that is a flaw you look back on as an artist as just something to improve on with proportions,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCYTZxcm14clhMN25kZGlZd01UNlR4cnlDUTBXRWdVSTVYRWRsUEkzOXdpeEdvUXdFUUhLa09Dc3BKR3JTNDRIQVJ6MmlPTnVMU05WcERZbjNqN2ZwbHc9PQ==

im not an art historian and i have limited reading of the artists and paintings histories i do believe the work was better received in britain and the usa ironically she was painted in a similar portrait similar pose strap off one shoulder by gustave courtois with a positive response and again by another artist straps up i suppose if im lucky ill be invited to pose for other talented artists  but i doubt it i would not say im a classical beauty by any measure nor am i a society lady married to a wealthy banker the point of the painting is much more the controversy that seems to surround the transgender experience or those accused of being transgender as the olympic games have again demonstrated im sure there are plenty of people who will say its an ugly portrait of a man in a dress or that i stole an opportunity from a real woman to be in a portrait that my shoulders are too broad my lines are not soft and graceful and my hands are too big and ironically those critics are more likely to be british or american and not french given the state of our political divisiveness but in a hundred years or so i suspect people will scoff at the idea that it was ever a big deal at all i hope ,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVNXzBDdnJFeGxCLWstazc2UzJkOVlPcWYwaU5CX3ZhOU5rQjlBa0dOOVkyUVhVWU5UOVNBSXpLTmdpaDlFVmJsUEVNUy0yRmE1N0wzRmFMUkdRU2thQ181Yk40WUN0amg2aGVpeldINmpuRFU9

i wrote this based on your painting i hope you dont mind and enjoy it the hooded figure stood looking out across the raging sea at the middle sister he had just finished the climb back down from the lowest of the glacial mountains known as the three sisters nobody had ever managed to summit the big sister just visible on the distant horizon though many had died trying the middle sister would be a brutally hard test he knew it was said that the gods dwelt in the upper reaches of the big sister and should any mortal climb all three sisters they would be granted their hearts desire the screaming of the gulls circling the middle sister broke his reverie tomorrow he would begin the crossing today the sea was too rough he hoped his tent would keep out more of the cold that his winter clothing had at least it wasnt snowing it was too cold for that,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVMFM0VUV3WUFPd245d3BZcnlkMGtEMVRPekFkd1BVX1VBb1Axdm1leUIzX3R4QU4zc25SLTcyZkEzQmJUN2lSdWRHXzNzNHpVRjF0WDlYdko2U083ZUE9PQ==

i think a lot of people know wlop and there are a lot of newer paintings of theirs that have way more detail and look impressive in all sorts of ways but i wanted to post this old one because it showcases one of the things i most admire this artist for the ability to lay down brush strokes that simultaneously look very rough and messy and yet are insanely expressive and perfectly convey what theyre supposed to convey its a skill thats very alien to me so i respect it tremendously,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVRmJPNWU0Vk9uUlR6Y3ZubzVUaGZDakFXX2dkSUsyeU1aMm91RXh2VUxzMkVvSndoSUR1SWk5WFFfb1dvUl9pVkxYbzljMmpmcVk4WXhHeTJDN1U3dWd6b01VeDFlU3QtUGwydUpOUmphbGc9

thank you for the insight i show this style at work not this particular art and most say id like to see it in colour i cant paint and i dont want to waste more time collecting more paper i had enough for my lifetime and i appreciate the fact that you see what i see its not about the colour but its how the art is so monotone that if you just dont pay attention enough you wont see the art but if you spend more time looking at it youll see the picture as a whole i guess in a world dominated by vibrant colours monotone colour is something different that grabs ones attention too thank you for your feedback i appreciate it,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVWVjdxd2pqM3Q3ak85a3M4V1ZNd01CYzl0S2l4V3FPS3VGWHBsRDdtZ1d0TUptZmJpRFZjZkRJS3RfS0YyNGkxWGJ3ZkY5T3BOaXZGRVJ1VzFLS0U5V1E9PQ==

i went to school for biology and got to know professors throughout all the science departments pretty much all of them were artists in some waymusic writing knitting painting whatever else to hear them talk about it art and science are two sides of the same coin having dabbled in various arts myself i get it you need to hone technical skills plan ahead and think critically once you have the skills you need to perform simple repetitive work over and over to create the piece all of that is stuff that any researcher is very familiar with as part of their job you cant be a great scientist without creativity and you cant be a great artist without intelligence,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmN3lydXFfZ0tYWk1Hb09SV0NTSTZ1VUdOZzBlcTgwQy1WUHl6Z0V0V0JYa0p0elUybEhicHBaWXMwMnFqeUEyeDh5cl94OVJ0SUM5SWs3dFhQVTZTZlE9PQ==

well you made this and so youre already way ahead of the vast majority of people who only ever think about making something without ever actually creating anything you made this and this is only a first step as long as you keep taking steps you keep advancing some people might advance quicker but the goal is to never stop even if the steps are small even if it takes a long time keep stepping forward otherwise youll never go anywhere artistic ability is not something that is handed down from generation to generation every artist must start from zero but like i said before the important part is that you start which you have now done that part is already behind you so just keep on moving at your own pace you are not inadequate you are only just getting started how exciting even the most talented artists start from nothing the talent grows not in your genes but from practice but youll never achieve anything if you dont try keep it up,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoOF9ZQXoxQXdPXzI3UUdobnlRVTVoUVNxUzF3eW5IdUFzcmU4LW1UaUNfYUhKZ2JkM2dzem5CS3VocFlCU21ZWGZheldhRllkemRVcWR1bllWLUtvakE9PQ==

thank you of course its really just a lot of sponging and splattering in a very specific order of layers using a palette of around <number><number> colours normally sponging a set of colours first then splattering the same colours on top before finishing it off with some more sponging until you get the desired effect other details can be painted in manually after its honestly a lot of fun but i do have to keep a formula written so i remember the right order in which i like to make it because it can get pretty intense with the amount of steps it takes  its a lot of fun though id definitely recommend giving it a try,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVobXR0MWt1RHJQV0NBRWE5YnhPb2Z0eE9BUmg0MEFtQmVKYVVrQV8zVGVISm1hZHhmUE1nSWtkcVJXLS1hMjl0MENEZFN0LVFDT1Yyb2RnMl9RU1NUbVE9PQ==

are you familiar with the works of anatoly fomenko i think you might be trying to reach the same place he got to perhaps you may need to learn to play chess to present an ongoing chess game in a believable way this looks like a forfeit after a stalemate to me except there are no kings on the board just an impossible knight how does the chess game go on with only one piece on the board this reminds me of an anonymous work i saw years ago called no detour with a lone figure in the foreground the midground a forest of blazes and beyond the fire people enjoying life in the background the person in the foreground just has to step through the fire to get to the other side your piece though has no opponent no challenge and no chess match just an open road eight lanes wide to discover along the way so how is it an ongoing chess game,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6TG1tX1d4M2FDbDQ1MFBUcmhoYmw3bko2Qzc1Q0NUa2tOS1lUUUViVGpubHU0Xzc4VjBHUGZXU2pQMXE1LTNOTGNiRjBvLWFjYVNJemVGR3hrU214SGc9PQ==

i wasnt familiar with the works of fomenko i gave a look and found them really interesting i see how you would recall him seeing my work i in fact know how to play chess and know its rules you see in this drawing lots of element of the game are distorted beginning from the board this last is really really long a parallelism to ones years of living but it finds its end in another living thing a tree that is recurrent in this drawing and not just with death so we could say that the opponent is the board itself life and the death at its end and its pieces are scattered at the end of the board for us to not be able to see as they are too far away a metaphor for the difficulties in life that we cannot forecast the last rule i broke is that we have only one piece the horse it is indeed the most erratic one moving in l and jumping around giving a feeling of confusion and uncertainty i guess i decided for it to be the only one because it better represent the loneliness with which we face life but also because we can find the other pieces by going forward friends knowledge wisdom and we are not meant to have them at the beginning,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6ZEpMclZpaGRlQXliWmxkRXNFRnRVOVoxSEZxelZIY1RnQ0Nkc1lvRF9odlZ6TkhqX1Z6OVhoSTlEbV96OUd2cXV5NEhEcEd4UEpnWGdrblpVNlJYd2c9PQ==

the angle is not very common to use for self pictures as art but its a bold move to try something uncommon and might be the new trend in art since most other views are becoming overdone and boring lighting and filter if used make for a very brown tone which isnt as appealing as grays for most but again bold choice too many bold choices may just be taken as bad art so be cautious with how many and what you choose to do differently nice work and keep putting out more if you want the feedback,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6WjhPNDFUN1l5am9XbzBjUWdmaTJjSzIwNnNScUNNT3dBbGV4MlpuejhBakl0SjJob2pSUGQ0WFlfMjFRZkJTNUlYaXNMXzdBVGh2cV9NYXRMVmxuRlMxQUpJNkphTTFNZDlvczJXb2ZUdEU9

thank you i feel like people look at these themes and decide that the art itself is bad or superficial or worthless and i totally get the aversion to it and i wouldnt even be quick to disagree if someone were to say that its offensive but im just glad that there are enough people out there who appreciate that these depictions are still interesting even if because they are hella seedy also call me crazy but i dont even find these to usually be that seedy maybe thats something weird in my upbringing but to me theres a certain wholesomeness to finding the human in these comedically disgusting portrayals its not like this is a scene of villainy for instance even if it is a scene of sex and sun and art and smoking and tattoos etc,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwbXZGVWJhQTBwY2UyYTJ6a2dWNm9wRzBwNF9ZajNxbG1CUnBwajgtV2tteVo1cUx1ZzJ6RDZUTXRTTkozUUx2dkNOZGt2S0o2QUYzR0phN2Q2UFhnTGc9PQ==

hi peter this one inspired me to write again i agree with uimaboredcosplayer this should be in a childrens book enjoy the little girl regarded the creature uncertainty she had found it while wandering through the forest she had gotten lost it didnt seem unfriendly to her but her mother had told her to be careful talking to random forest creatures was definitely not being careful it was mostly covered in moss and dirt except for a mane of brightly coloured flowers around a white wood mask the keeper regarded the strange animal before it in all its centuries tending the forest it had never seen anything like this before the animal had been making what the keeper thought of as happy noises like a chirping bird until it saw him now it was stood there watching him the keeper noticed that this animals mane was made of long blonde fur reaching up the keeper did the only thing it could think to curious the girl watched as the creature plucked a flower from its mane slowly careful not to startle her it leant forward and tucked the flower behind her ear this task done the creature shambled off into the forest leaving the bemused girl behind,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4ekFyUFoxcmp5QURabzZNWHlPNktrTkZFZ3Fxc3B4bF82WHRSVGN3S3VsdjJ0WU54OHFTSWFfUFNUazA4c1VRZ3RkRVdHeTJLdl9iOHZsRG9pV0hRUkE9PQ==

so there was a similar comment like this in another sub and i replied with an explanation about these paintings ive posted lately this is a copy of my reply its a bit long hope you dont mind thank you a lot for your compliments and advice i really appreciate it turns out what youre saying is right when i first started this style june <number> artists such as basquiat noel fielding had been the ones that guided and inspired me so much through their great artworks but i also havent had much chance to paint and practice a lot due my personal work and i dont have many paintings yet ive been working as a game designer making zen paintings at visuddhi art studio and just graduated university last year with a degree in interior design for the last <number> years i only made <number> or <number> paintings in this style including the party animals collection if you count all of them as one piece and the last one was in june <number> hideaway this painting good together was actually done at the end of january <number> before lunar new year then i decided to fix it for the last time yesterday after <number> years it stayed in a corner of my house thats why i wrote <number> instead of <number> in some paintings i think they are representing myself well and in some paintings like hideaway or this one i look up to my favorite basquiats artwork such as hens meyer because fell in love with its concept the whole time these paintings were what i have done in my free time as my hobby my practicing and studying art from the greatest artists never did i believe that one day i would be able to be a professional artist with this style until last year i decided to follow this path however to be able to represent myself better all i can do right now is to keep studying practicing and developing until i can reach that goal the crown on my painting is not the crown from basquiat but its from the tattoo on my boyfriends arm as its the symbol of his grandfathers brand its the letter m that stands for martin and looks like a cowboy hat so with the love for basquiat i wanted to put this symbol on the painting to remind me of his iconic crown but again i dont hide a the truth im using a lot of similar elements like ladders words shapes i understand deeply that theres still a really long way ahead for me to know how to control or portrait my own vision and ideas i just got back to social media not so long ago trying to post all the old artworks first so i hope everyone will be patient and check out my new paintings which im working on right now they will come soon edit so sorry for bad english  you can check my profile to see the picture of the tattoo i mentioned in this post <url> ive wasted a long time doing what i wasnt happy with and these paintings with the similar art style of basquiat were during the time i was practicing and finding my own style <number> and maybe it was an escape from reality so i just got back to working on a few days ago starting with fixing this painting now im trying to post all of my old works meanwhile im making some new paintings at the same time im always grateful with every thought and advice to help me develop myself in the future,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5dlpMQkVEd3VDdFV3elNOUUZFWVczRUdPbmRzUXBEOXVfMWhjdzRWMlJjUl9Ic0ZvX3oxVzVUd1FydGJmS0pXMWtBdzBpcE5YWnpkUmNoQ2NENXgtbHc9PQ==

initially i started out doing ink contour line drawings from life either a live model or myself just sitting in front of a mirror this often results in odd proportions and crooked wonky eyes etc sometimes thats cool specifically because of the unique imperfections but i was curious to see what a more accurate contour line drawing would look like now for the last two years ish ive been working almost entirely from photo references this allows me to really slow down sketch everything out in pencil get all the proportions correct and then do a contour line drawing over top i realize this is probably heresy to many artists who do amazing and beautifully imperfect contour line drawings or continuous contours from life but  oh well i enjoy my process and im enjoying my results so far,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHYmpfdEpKdFliQ3ZsQmtJNS15QXRMaUJVY3YwWXhqbUVSZ2duMm1FdDZfTlNaLU1ROHZuY1NacnRtY2t6TDFfcUhLcm9HekZxb3FyQU9ydXpHQ1FBdWc9PQ==

i remember learning about happy jack in high school this painting was my art teachers favourite to me this piece appears to be an australian farmer in his s the australia earthtone colour palette also seems to reiterate my idea that this is a man who has spent his life working the land as most australian farmers did during this time period they spent nearly the entirety of their life trying to sustain their farm and feed their family from dusk until dawn these farmers would work in the dry dusty and arid conditions because it was all they knew he looks happy but he also looks tired and withdrawn during the time in which happy jack was painted australia was experiencing one of its worst droughts in history which can also be depicted in the background of this piece work was hard money was scarce but despite this jack always managed to have a smile on his face,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZQdWFGLV9BRW5KQkpaM1VQNERZemx4RUxJaDZJVjRIamh3N2V5WUo2YUhKbklaUHkyNUhLZ3VsWnpUdVRsalF5eFhVUEZfWUh6S1dIb3hlTm9Tb3N2RXFnQldZVlo0WUk4VnNLWnBTc1pGbjg9

this just made me think of westworld doesnt look like anything to me and i get that its not supposed to visually resemble anything but it doesnt even evoke an emotion in me maybe im lacking something but abstract art like this doesnt do anything for me though i still respect the effort and artistry i also dont feel any connection to the title i feel like it could have been called death of the firstborn and it would still hit me the same way but again that probably says more about me than anything else thinking about it i can understand how the bright contrasting colors and chaotic nature could evoke the feeling of an audience laughing but i dont think i would have gotten there without knowing the title first then i feel like im overthinking and grasping i spent a lot of time thinking about this and my own nature so maybe it got to me more than i first thought in a way i didnt expect,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZRY3NEM2hPLW92ckRHTDVRTzUyWG9HcjNQQkY2OC1OaG5IUkpFSk9mU2diLUhmY24xdnhUdGpTYmVaMjRLbUUxcU1rME5uZi1qMzdlY05QaGlJTndKUmc9PQ==

this hemicircular design was inspired by wwii era flieger watches particularly made by elgin i wanted to modernize the concept of a flieger watch of that time but still pay homage to certain design elements and the feelings it evoked the word flieger is german and translates to flier which in this day and age is more compatible with people flying all over the world and changing gmt zones this was the basis for my decision to create an automatic gmt flieger the dial is plated with a thick layer of k gold it has also been protected by a uvresistant nano coating that would ensure that it remains pristine for decades to come the dial has a <number> oclock date window with a lumed datedisc i chose this feature to mainly reference the <number> oclock position for easy reading of time using the hour and minute hands part of the dial design is an embossed and textured image of the front view of a british wwii spitfire fighter plane above the flieger script,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhaWNnY2lnRVJJUEo1SlZDbXpUcHdObi1vQ19KZHp6bl9jUUJqcGNfZjE1YWNhc3JBNGtvRmZMSG9sMU9PcHNkQ3BOUHg0RFI4bUJXYnRfYldMRDNRSkE9PQ==

randomly saw this when stumbling through rart i love it just like other pieces of art from you going by looking at your profile just now d what is your favorite artwork of the ones you posted so far i realized that this one looks a bit similar to the girl from your artwork taking a break from a year ago like an alter ego but that might be my own fantasy going wild also i noticed the graffiti you use in a lot of your artworks do you just do that because you feel like it is it to give the whole thing your own spin or does that have a specific reason and background the question comes from noticing that the amount often varies and i wondered if that has a deeper meaning i can also get if you dont want to talk about it of course i also hope that you dont mind me asking but can you recommend anything specific if it comes to learning to draw in a similar style how did you learn it i know that it is all about practice and understanding but thought that you might have special suggestions to kinda find a good starting point to eventually end up where you are,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZqRmRoRUU0eWtuTjhZWE0zVmxNaWZTMFFlQ2pFZG52OHJud3BqR043UTVoZGxFaXpoV0VBb0xmSkF6UzQ3NkJobkNCbm5tVW9Hd1dZTy13dVBtOWhNTkE9PQ==

thats funny you mention it i always raise an eyebrow too not puritanically i love nakedness but in the sense that it often strikes me as easy art you put something naked in and boom its instantly more interesting to look at you cant fight hard wired human primal instinct were gonna look at naked it doesnt invalidate a piece of art for me but it does raise my level of scrutiny i think this particular picture is beautiful btw for some reason it didnt hit me as a naked picture the subject is used in a way that doesnt seem to exploit their nakedness to me at least clothes would probably seem out of place in this image but thats a guess,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZrZWtUdW9IcDYydHk2WTRlYTBRN25IbV8zMmhITGF6NkI3R1dIRFY5UFlKeFhuRVVrZXMwRUplQ0pkTHFDWVAtQzFsRkl5ZGFKbW0tZ284Y3V6dDJGNGc9PQ==

a significant amount of art through humanitys history has been focused on the nude form from depictions of the female form like the venus of willendorf est <number> years old to michelangelos male figure david as to the why we are often inspired to create art because of the beauty we perceive in the natural world birds flowers sunsets anything we find novel and aweinspiring can cause us to want to create art that reflects the wonder we feel so if you consider the natural beauty of the human form and add into that the biological urge to have sex and the souls desire to connect with and understand others you can see why so much of art reflects the nude form because we can each draw different inspirations from it leading to various and varied depictions for example look at the works of hr giger and frida kahlo and compare how each views the human form and utilizes it in their art both have a reverence for the female form in particular but create vastly different art pieces from that inspiration additionally to someone like michelangelo who found the male form more compelling these views and inspirations would have never even occurred so there are as many ways to portray the nude form as there are people to do the portraying because each one of us sees a different aspect of beauty in it,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZraHgxZFRfM0ZnTHpsNFpGU1ZfNU1mRkdWZFVwTkF4Z1N2WThlS2paV2xDS0syRDB2SHc1eHJ6VUFEV3BselJ5YlpYblBRWS0zemtES0hkX3BTd0pYOFE9PQ==

yes pre mixing is also handy in terms of keeping the colors consistent but how do you go about that do you have a little container with a lid on or do you pre mix it on the palette and spray it now and then with some water i struggle with acrylics drying too fast on my palette if i pre mix color i know you can put some slow drying medium into it but i havent tried it out,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZrbWdmelF1eWNONDFvVkJ0ajNMODY4clljSzlKUlVxQnNzZDEycTI5VmQtMi1HOG1nTlZVZHNMNVplTXBRVnhKTVNqazNOZ2MtSGZzT2ZxajdoY1F1Tmc9PQ==
there is something about the human form as it truly is that is artistic in itself its been a centre piece of art for all of art history there is a lot of nudity in this sub but honestly it generates such discussion about the validity of the medium as to make the work deeply artistic for that reason alone,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZrMzZDbHlSWHpIWk92ZF9YbmFFQ0EzVnNyWTlYaUZQYkhNYmRHTGhYX1FTc1FuVlFmQWNjWThoaVg3b3dNXzNYR1BjOGViLVh4elU5d0hhM29XN3NJVHc9PQ==
great question so for premixing i usually just focus on mixing based on what element im working on at a given moment i wont premix for the entire painting per se so that cuts down on the concerns over things drying too fast but the fast drying is still an issue nevertheless i use a wet palette to keep my paints from drying on the palette look up the brand mastersons stawet palette it was a game changer for my painting process,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZrQTlMVUM2V2p6ZmV1c1V0WTctemVSMzZ0b2ljY1IyX0NSLWYtcW9MVlZzdmtzbUtsNkhsbWR3R2dWQmVxNHlPZF80ZWpKeG5VbG9fQy1UUWs2alkxZmc9PQ==

because people are lazy and sex sells thats the short answer the long answer is that the naked human form is the most recognizable form we know we are hard wired to see it read it and to appreciate it its the basis for our concept of beauty if agreeable it most often represent health and makes us happy we are simply just built to appreciate it this ties in to my short answer in how artists use the human form a youthful fit woman in the nude will automatically appeal to people putting her in good lighting and in some interesting surroundings isnt exactly easy as any picture like this requires planning preparation and patience as well as technical skill but its lazy relative to how actually important artworks use the human form this picture tells us nothing it lacks any context outside of being a pretty picture of a pretty woman in a pretty landscape which is perfectly fine but lazy,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZsbUhKZFVSVk1wQmoxV3BJQWRXb1k1VWd6aEZ3LU1VRXpBNW1pQTgxM0dLVXlldDFOYUNSamVJamZ6ZDlwSVpja0lkWWtVQlRVNHRfTGFyOGJSLVN1anc9PQ==

i get what you are saying but there is some merit to be found in genres defined by the people not the individual what i mean is what a genre is cant be completely up to interpretation or it loses its meaning it should have some agreed upon characteristic so as to create and fulfil expectations such is the purpose of a genre its a descriptive quality meant to provide information on a quick and easy manner so when one says selfportait it creates certain expectations now if you wish to subvert that thats ok but in your sense of the word from what i understand almost all art would be considered self portrait as art always carries in it a reflection of the artist making the definition too broad by the way the art was great very nice work,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ0TUNYb2doMEsyWDQxd2ZUVzRBTDJNaFI4SGprNXgwZTdiUE5KS2tnU1lxTkJPZ0NTSjJ3Q0Y1ZWpUeHZwWE4tbzdMd1I1dTJvVENlODRDV0Uta3RsQkE9PQ==

the pink accents in one half of the image and red in the other is so good but i do find the top half easier to look at because the red doesnt contrast so sharply with the green i recently watched gravity falls a show from my childhood so im very sympathetic to forests right now and the colors are just perfect for this photo this art gives me a rare feeling i have never been able to explain but i think its a guilty feeling maybe i feel regret that my life isnt ever this mood i dont know i think there are songs that make people feel this way i love the way the flora looks in this its so serene to me personally i love the subtle graininess this makes me feel like there are feelings that i want to feel but i cant fully feel them the last time i contemplated this feeling was about <number> years ago and back then i kind of just wanted to repent for whatever i did wrong its like this artwork is god and i know i am not close to god so i feel guilty what this brings to the world is better on so many levels than anything ive given the world its like im looking a the garden of eden and i have no idea where it is and i cant find out so i feel left out of a feeling that i want to know im not even religious,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ3dThjS3VEaXB2aWNZak9YN1NZa0V5Qk11QWtxaE9sVHNWX3dFWXlFYU84THJGa3diUHBnMXl3c3NBMmRZLTNXMThFSFVLellLUXZpaUMzbC15M1oxdlE9PQ==

the composition of this piece is well thought out and stunning the contrast between a monochrome red color scheme and the white rat atop a pile of chocolate makes the rat and its hoard stand out and attract the eye in an entrancing way at the focal point of the piece the detail displayed by the rat shows that you have a strong understanding of anatomy not only do you understand the anatomy of the rat but you have the skill to make its posture incredibly expressive this piece has a strong attention to detail from the scratches left on the chocolate by the rats hind leg to the detailing on the boxes that creates a vivid impression on the viewer the pattern and design of the background works well to create a sense of movement reminiscent of waves crashing up against rocks on the coast without distracting from the focal point a moment of chaos frozen in time this piece uses the defensive expression of the rat the dominating use of red the chaotic movement of the background and the well worn appearance of the boxes to create a strong feeling of foreboding anger this is just my interpretation of the things i found appealing about this piece it is my opinion which is completely subjective it is my attempt at a candid analysis of your piece i could see this painting being in an art museum,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ4OFNUcmY2b3RDUlhaY0gxeWZQU1VVYWQ1aUp0dWFlSzZSUWlqR29ud1lfSV9yckQzYURaV0M0R0J6SXQ0QlZGUGtzYW1sVHhRUl91UEdXRjliUkVPWHc9PQ==

i mean this page is mostly nudity at this point it seems but this doesnt really seem horny like theres nudity but its not at all sexualised the mere presence of nudity isnt necessarily sexual this one is actually pretty interesting where the body is the landscape of the piece i dunno seems very different from some of the stuff here which are basically just artistic nudes which dont necessarily have no artistic value but are quite repetitive,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ4U29MWWF5QVBVVC1DWHZEUzMyRDFkbDhjLUdVdlJhZEE0X25ybjRNa01iYUhIaUFVRlR6djVNcXhscEZXX2NjcDA3U2tpcE1LdWUtS1hkV2ZuUmxHN0E9PQ==

i dont disagree about unnecessary sexualisation but i dont think the subject has to be specifically masturbating for it to count as such i could understand if the composition was completely naturalistic as though we were voyeuristically watching them go about their day but the subject is conscious of being seen and their picture being taken theyre posing even if it is in a disaffected kind of way which can make one assume theyre very conscious of the way theyre presenting themselves,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0OXdob2FpcERUMDEzZ3pham10aFdTQ2x4S1BYZGZCYWNKNG9GUXNLRkVRbmhCdUlObTMzZldya2pPVzZfUGNzOUsxSVI1LWNLOFRwalB2aG9uLWRHUFE9PQ==

i on the otherhand hate the unnecessary nipple sure it can happen when lounging around the house but shes staring right into a camera breaking the th wall its not a snapshot of someone lounging from god perspective its a very deliberate portrait with a very deliberate nipple show with honestly kinda poor lighting and over all composition it just has the nipples and cats that reddit loves so itll be upvoted to high heavens,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0enlEYnhCcUNGV2pITDZVMlppRllxdEJib2hhbkJ6a1pnZlA5cmk4dVROSFNKN3d1MURvdS1uUk1XeWYxbExhbGo1YUtGLXVfZEJ5WGlxYW9neUg3OFE9PQ==

i really like the context that this picture creates the capture of the light is fantastic and the colors really sing of a shoulder season when the fish are starting to move im a recreational angler though and whats missing for me is the rod and reel that i expect to see in this persons hands given their golferlike pose he has the position of someone thats just snagged a good fish and is trying to safely reel it in over questionable shallows with a fly rod theres a sort of messy line above the subject that might be a rod but id expect it to be a lot clearer as it could also be a background feature if thats not what was intended thats probably my own bias reading it out of the picture,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0aVZMTDBNT0RWSktOeWpqS2t2RkVXMVUwbl9EWFJjVVR5TTViZ0JBTmdWcHR4b0NJbnhvY3VYN3pzQ3JHYlJsZVZ2ZjBBNXJ6NkcxZUVZX28zZklpMXFUM0o4OHdIeFFsbGdZZGFHbWV0V009

i agree that artists dont owe unfettered access watermarks are usually fine but for this piece the watermark takes up so much of the visual space and with enough contrast that it is entirely unable to be ignored while trying to appreciate the work you dont have to give away art and watermarking practice is obviously completely up to the artist but when posting on a forum or subreddit like this one and <number> of the visual space just reads as branding people wont resonate with or appreciate it as well as the could the foreign film caption thing feels like an incomplete analogy because i would only have this complaint about captions if they took up half the screen and covered the actors faces,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0UEx2cGFPcWFWelJyaVlqNFVQUGxJbGlWVUJOSlRWeExSUzd0STBzWGFoS3BKZk01NHZzWkQ5eHhsLWlNcjQ1bFI0ZWhaeXZ0WWtKQ1NudXQ0WnZPM3c9PQ==

its just that the human brain cant not read text this big for a lot of viewers images like this dont read as art with a watermark but a watermark with art behind it a lot of artistsdesigners use more of a pinstripe watermark for this reason smaller font or logo but repeated across the image in a pattern the image is still obviously watermarked but the watermark doesnt distract the eye so much from the actual work,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0ZGNlSGE5QV9IWWxadlBWVHNnV240V2pVOVFBUWx3WVB6ek84V2t6ZFhYZkVvMDk5OU9vUFNNRGo2bVd6OVVZblZKUExvd3RlZmJIYVlZRWVJdF9oYlE9PQ==

correct the composition posing colour and focus makes the selfie with the cats art which to be as pedantic as you are dismissive is what makes a bathroom selfie for onlyfans art as well neither the body parts or acts captured nor audience sexualization of them disqualifies a piece as art theres ancient art everyone recognizes and applauds that is literally just a threesome,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1X05CYWtlb3E0SWhuN1FibWdaWVRIY1gwajRaT1M0bkxJMlc2RVJCcmRyalF6TWlrYnVJazRseXh2NmMtbUtCYm8zZ201SnVCNEVhMWV3N1F6SE5VbEE9PQ==

i think its pretty great composition i could take or leave the nipple slip the intense stare is much more captivating and the cats create some interest ill ape some other criticisms of the lighting i think a diagonal shading from top right to bottom left would help make a nice contrast from a beauty in bloom and her feline friends in shadow and it lines up well with the lines already in the shot i think theres a lot of talent in this but could definitely be pushed further,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1NjRsdUxMY2ozVF95ajVQQzhmOW1oc3ZfMUJxNlliMVZ5S19ZRV91ZGdDTk1Vd3Jwa0hoUGVyT1hrVE8xUmF6WC01TnpRVTRpVk5udXNoNFlOVDdzelE9PQ==

i could care less about the nipple but the artists whole mo are images of women in various stages of undress depicting some scene if that is how she wants to produce her images more power to her these images are infinitely better than the majority of the nsfw art photos on the site i like the subject of the composition but i do not feel particularly moved by this image compared to the artists other works the couch taking up <number><number> of the image i find very jarring the color and texture of the couch is a nice match to the atmosphere of the work i think if the lighting could be harsher on the subject if that is what she was going for to create a more dynamic look however that is not the normal type of lighting for women subjects my nd biggest gripe are the cats they are out of focus while the wall and main subject are in focus maybe that is the goal and i am completely missing the point i think the subject the cats and her expression and hair are my highlights of the image the rollers in the hair is a nice touch,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1MHNmZVowM2w0eW01djZqa2MwX0pIQ2QtT19aWi12Qm5WN3dsaXZ3eXp0WGNCZGtWeGlvTDJUOVQ3R1E4TWxMekZ1eGVkemt2Zko5S3pzcVdldGQ4alE9PQ==

if you hate how sexualized everything has become then you should agree that this piece doesnt really need to show a nipple im far from being a prude but i always ask myself does this add anything to the piece in this case it really doesnt so why is it there plus as other people have said its not like this is a voyeuristic picture its an intentional aware photo with the subject staring right into it which means everything in it is a deliberate choice it doesnt add anything to it,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1cWlQNnJtR1NwZ1kyUFlxZk9LSWc2Mk5adnZDQV9VdlFIMTM5MXhYUkxUZ1ZrcVR5dzVjU3pjbEhZUXhsZjZJdW5uM2daX3V0Vm1DS3F3SDBWd2tHY0E9PQ==

playing devils advocate from two perspectives one not everything included has to be necessary nor will everything included ever be i see this critique used more often for film than photographs but i think the counter still stands its not necessary that she has red hair for example but the fact people are talking about the nipple and not the hair speaks to their perspective on female nipples vs female hair or at least their perspective on the artists perspective or intent two one who hates the sexualized nature of certain qualities such as the female nipple may indeed prefer that art display these qualities in nonsexual scenarios in the hopes that it might normalize them indeed for them it may add quite a bit to the piece,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1ekZRRFNFX0MtZy04alZGeDBrRXJMMlU1MEVHNGhoWUsxNWV1bzdNcVphRk5qbmVmdk1CUWpXSTBtUXlINkI0ZEV2aUtfdHA4WE1scG5mYzFCSkI1U0E9PQ==
thats fair enough but i personally think in the opposite direction theres no need to desexualize the female nipple in my opinion regardless of what the intention may have been its an eye catcher and it takes away from the rest of the picture imo,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1a1FDbm1XTDBjV3JnZVhlWmRwLW1kdnJmcVVCZ0plaUFQRG9qWm1saGRnRVVJZ2NySTQtaGtjRU1XWC1WRzNUR1NDc2t4cHBqN0hxdnRuSHVJelYxekE9PQ==

i hate how sexualized everything has become as in how her nipple immediately has to be assigned a sexual component instead of just being part of her body that said no i dont agree with you because its a socially relative sexualization of an arbitrary body part if we all suddenly fetishized noses the same way then people would be up in arms about how her nostrils dont add anything to the piece and id have the same argument and i also dont think the awareness of the subject detracts from the candidness it looks like a private photo one might take of their wife one day while the two lounge on the couch the uneasiness of nudity having fallen by the wayside a long time ago no more noteworthy than ones own nudity shes looking at the camera but shes not making any sort of sexual expression shes literally just sitting there with an impassive look on her face assigning sexualization to just existing reveals more about the viewer than the piece itself,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1V3NPbGV3WjJfTWIyQ1REX2xSYS1idUE1MlJoSDA4WTFXbHFuSXBRVXdVMkJWMzhjbjd6cjdLZ21GVGx6V2tWa3Y1UWRwTWYtWFRRcTZ4b0U2NVoxYVE9PQ==

a powerful druid from our dd campaigns in theomachy character vitalia the evergreen wood elf druid vitalia was just a child when the forces of gorg the god of war set the ancient forest of sylendil ablaze destroying her home a kindhearted imperial commander found her hiding among the smoldering ruins of a wood elf village and took her to vandis the imperial capital where she was put to work as one of the many gardeners in the capitals noble courts vitalia grew up tending the emperors perfectly sculpted gardens grateful towards her saviors but longing the wild and untamed forest she had lost she became a beautiful if not demure woman and made many good friends among other servants in secret she continued to pray to mother nature as she did as a child in the forest and not to the new gods that watched over the empire years passed her friends grew old emperors rose and fell and court ladies withered like springtime flowers under the summer sun but vitalia remained unchanged to the eyes of aging human nobles as she worked on the emperors gardens everyone thought vitalia was just a quiet relic from the past then one day the imperial court woke up to a shocking surprise overnight the emperors perfectly sculpted gardens had been transformed into a wild untamed forest and vitalia was nowhere to be found everyone thought she had gone forever yet when a noble knight was sent to investigate the mysterious appearance of a new forest to the north of the imperial capital he found vitalia she was confident if not defiant as she danced in the forest of her childhood now born again through the power of the reawakened mother nature about the theomachy setting in theomachy vengeful gods fight each other for ultimate control of the universe while the mortals of naam struggle for power on a dying world divine magic is a force without expressed will that the warring gods hoard and wield against each other threatening to undo the entire world clerics and paladins are either devout followers of the warring gods or theomachists who fight against the gods liberating divine magic and using it against them what do you think,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2VldfQnN4V1NWUEFmZlhZNzFsSkRlNEdCbmV1ZWlzSWNJY0ZnQmhyNWpkVHFHV0o1N082TE9lTUFMRjhYRE53bFFLR0xlTDNaWWhfMmhKVzZ2OFZLaEE9PQ==

this image is broken because there is separation between the head and the body the brain tries to fix it because the spacing between head and body is consistent with reality therefore brain decides it looks like head belongs ot the body my brain is doing the thing that happens for illusions its not like i believe the head is attached to the body in the photo im not a fucking idiot it just vaguely looks that way,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3Wlh3dDAtZ3VyRnl3T3BfMDZiMjFvMkd0VzN5bVhfN2R5TE9vNVd1UjdvSmZhWVhZaC1QNHFIX0FGMlg2X201TnUxRnpPb3ozTGZyWm1CZ3Vaa1hiMkE9PQ==

if this works for anyone id be a bit impressed theres too much separation between the two elements that unless you know what it is supposed to be you dont make the connection and then at that point it isnt an optical illusion there are plenty of examples of this sort of thing that actually work i also dont know why we are arguing about this other than my meeting got cancelled,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3M1h2WW1UOFl4QjB4WmVrYVhKN1ZvbV9OT2NWT3ZrUmRfUHZLS2FSTXRZNlllZERJOXVWREJDQk9nXzRBRFE4Z2FsamVUc3A1eEQxX05qcmJXX0Q2Wmc9PQ==

people have always been supportive about other peoples art the hair on top right is a bit odd the wierd shadows between the background shoulder and the neck the breast and the part above it connect in a wierd angle the light given to the face that would usually give volume makes it seem like her face is smudged its strange errors for someone who would make a drawing like this the hair follows a pattern i have followed the ai art in the past too so i recognise some patterns if im wrong i will apologise like others alr said i think the artist probably is a good artist just used a generated image as reference but shouldnt relied on it too much nothing wrong with experimenting anyway,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3YVA1bzFLVDZ4YXRJUHVvQkVOcnFqYlU1OEgwVlFKQzRxX0FMeTIxU0lkckwzWm5MRDdodExRZG1RWjQzN0VxUG1CTzNxaFp0c1dVdWZLTjZHWnU4aFE9PQ==

hey all sorry thought i commented on this earlier this was a digital study for a painting i plan on working on soon that said i really loved how it turned out my work plays with identity structure and process i find beauty in the process and i love to let it shine through identity and censorship is something i can never get away from in my work there is something thought provoking about a censored face with more fully rendered genitals in the same work the censorship for the face is a bright yellow to bring attention to this idea thanks yall hope you enjoy,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdFeFhoU0l6TkVIWDlienNZTlFveEFnaWV1LTNNZFFSMUpZY3JQajRFSWlQRGxNSlNBUWVuaGJUc0RPREJmcGVOZ1hUcFVSTjF4ZVd0dUxxbEpBNnBmdVE9PQ==

excellent very evocative and emotional illustration i especially love the left most hearts while very metaphorical it is a clear and good illustration of things like pain despair sorrow or just feeling like falling apart i can look at each of those hearts and think yeah emotion nailed stylistically the motives are strong and the use of colour really works especially the use of black and how it comes across as almost uncontrollable i legit think this could be useful in a therapeutical way were one simply points to the heart best examplifying the feeling and yeah astral seems pretty apt,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdFU3JteHE4cndNUENRR3ZtX0VGQXl1Njl3cjlINndleGtpR0dYa1ViTHk0Qk1tZnFZTS16ZHJfeXZJMnZQWmV6Q21BVlBXRHpOU2JKQTg3R1Z2U2hHVVZoVU9aczNDLWsza1pDcVdnMDRBZVU9

yes the best tip to draw in any style is to start drawing copy the people you admire draw what you love draw what you like and sprinkle in some lessons to learn what challenges you then work on that draw portraits and full body comics and anime still life and landscapes do it all and try to learn something new every time even something as small as you like the line weight on that tree or even though that line doesnt match your reference you like it better your style will develop and youll be able to pass it on,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdGM3NKYmNNUzZMM2JZaDI1VlZ4RUt0dVEzU1BFdkR6X2ZjLWM3TGtfM29TVWlCUmtubmNrWnd5U2lVTXlUQTVmMXV1dTVNZjhMckE3ZEYyZXFVSTYtQVE9PQ==

thats a really great answer i had a period of trying to draw portraits by pencil but it took forever and didnt look great i want to be able to sketch well or use charcol but i cant seem to let myself go copying is a good idea i really like the shading and the highlights on this one is this from a reference photo,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdGZ21mdU9fakRLUU5rY1BjVVktLUtMS3RGSmZvOHJwNzZJSmNVeC1obWMyUW5YSVhtRThQZmZ1dzBlUk01RmNadkN3VGZqcmhZX01oZVdDblRFY2VPTkE9PQ==

malaysia oddly has many varieties of vampires here <number> of the most popular are described some folklore as below <number> pontianak the quintessential vampire of the malaysian archipelago classically a beautiful long haired red eyed womanlike spirit that typically drinks the blood of hapless men interestingly the name derives from the word pohon which means tree in malay some folklore even state they like to reside in banana palms during the day while often dressed in white my pontianak thinks a black dress contrasts better with her pale skin <number> langsuirlangsuyar often mistaken for the more famous pontianak though often associated with owls or other birds of prey sometimes even transforming into one theyre unique in the sense that they drink blood from a hole from the nape of their neck my langsuyar is self conscious of the cervical orifice and prefers to keep it covered up <number> menanaggal penanggalan the infamous horrifying looking vampire that preys on the blood of pregnant women and newborns the malaysian variety is usually depicted as a floating head with entrails while the indonesian and philippine versions often have their torsos my menanaggal is just happy to have friends who dont mind her quirkiness <number> toyol a rather popular ghoul that derives from aborted fetuses imbued with animistic dark magic the little goblins are often known to steal gold and shiny jewelry but notoriously many types of toyol need to be sated with a meal of blood by their owners failure to do so would result in the creature attacking their owners instead my toyol is more than happy with his bling,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPcXp4TlI5MF9lZnU5TEx6ay1NRVVwV1RRMkQwUXpFbDgxYkxDWVQ4dmJLNDN3S2hqR19CZlpQWUFYZWFfMkNoV3ozVnpVd1ZIYnR2TENCLWUtaVRzNDJ6M2lBNnZBQ2dhU1FncjFibzRsR009

this is what i got from that she smiled at him with all the love in the world as she drew closer he inhaled her perfume and his mind flickered erratically across their life together paris at the tower london overlooking the bridge a hot steamy night in kairo just next to the pyramids a cold cabin in finland mornings evenings everything his lips moved closer to hers as he kissed her in the most gentle way he could she answered his kiss as she momentarily stiffened up then she pulled back and her loving smile became angelically radiant he swallowed hard a tear forming in the corner of his left eye her eyes glazed over a bit as she teared up and whispered no guilt dear no guilt you were always the quick on the uptake before she went limp in his arms and her knife clattered against the klinker floor he gently withdrew his own dagger from her back as he carefully laid her to rest on the bed theyd spent their last two weeks on hed known for over a month but he hadnt been able to bring himself to do it he drew a deep shaking breath as he looked down at his dagger then he dried his tears and put it back in the concealed holster it had been nice to feel like a normal person for a half a year but as everyone knew in the community the day you ignore reality is when it comes knocking on your door he exhaled and nodded to himself it was time to go back to work again,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdRN3NFYnBXVVVkZ29UYnMySXZqR25aOEhCZGJScnV6V0FDeDhaX2lMR2M5dzVnMWJDSG5DRjdLcG9hTG9ienNVTjRCQ3RZU0xRc1RwVDluRTFvM3RyMFE9PQ==

right on id encourage you to not do that what is the theme or idea behind this work what is it meant to evoke from the viewer these kinds of questions should guide you when titling something that title sounds like something you picked randomly and so it gives the work an immediate impression of just trying something that soundslooks cool but has no depth i think there is depth here beyond just the technique i can see the artist in the work so let me see you in the title as well first impressions and all that ya know,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdoNGJyVF94cHRKd1RjWW5ma1NZTnZUb1ZvOWJFdkVLS0FwLUMzVFJwUFAwQmE2ak5WVkl1WUxZOGlQQVR6dE5SMXl2NHVZQVZCYkdveWw4MHZoQVhueFE9PQ==

you have a professional outlook and thats valid not sure if op is doing it for business or not i like the creative randomness of it the reason i clicked this post was to find out why they titled it paradox from a business perspective it couldve been powerful to leave the title mysterious to the viewer i dont value that much personally art can be exciting when left completely open to the imagination with no guide on where it should take you its a multifaceted discipline some practice it for money others for expression it is not clear even to the artist what their work represents or the affect it will have i guess everyone has different priorities to me art is the conveying of emotion from one to another often words cant capture that so why not be unique,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdpbDVuYlNqdEJLT2JXc25abHAxNno0eWlZaVBYdHZJZ0ZEdktfdVFaZUJpYnR0R0I1Yk5Qa0tUdm83R1pGeDBSMTU3cWtBaV9PRnVoV3pHMmxyM1FPN2c9PQ==

take starry night by van gogh for example the title is simple and appropriate it doesnt really change the emotions or sensory reactions the viewer might have the art itself speaks volumes beyond what words can capture in this sense creative expression sometimes transcends the need for a title sometimes what you feel when you look at a piece of art it cant be fully expressed in words and thats okay,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdpdjF2dUhLLTI3a2ltRV9LTDZsNEwzQm4ycmR5ZF9na2p4Mm9VR1JHNjdsbkItd1owR2RpcjJoVVpRNXNGQ1NBdG5MMDN3bHNaazExQ1VqeXlBQ3hGZ0E9PQ==

its from the videogame unakis its essentially an amalgamation that is keeping order in a treacherous land thats prone to corruption from the influence of an event that has happened in the past its the final boss of the game its very old and its head is melting while the heart above its soul disintegrates with the passage of time but mostly when it becomes active to restore order it does this by removing the pillars around it and opening the giant coffin thats its body this coffin creates a heat wave after sitting open for long enough causing mass destruction for the sake of preserving the land from scarringblackness essentially land thats permanently rendered to disintegrate any life on it the warden is essentially a defiant pseudodeity that tries to go against the fate appointed by actual deities and it assumes necessity of destruction in its ways of doing things,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqR1JsXzNiREZVb2J0Q2VIWkJHeFM3LVJnY2ZyVGtJUk5OVERhN1BCRUg5dTRQUzJ3Vkw0WFpTOEZpYjZVV3k4dzVUVGxNWGNSNjVkZy1ISkh0MEdRU1E9PQ==

i was asking if blo king the user would stop their posts from showing up yes it is obvious that is how itd work but i wasnt sure on account of reuploads and such im not asking the artist or museum to take down their work im haply for them if they keep posting its just boring and in my opinion insists upon itself its the same hook every time and im bored of seeing it i only wanted to know if i could turn it off for myself not others i dont give the slightest care what other people do keep loving it and up voting it if thats what you want its jist boring and insists upon itself,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdrRFEzNWRRTVhQb0lqVmtHNlRSaGFoQ3ZrcTU4cWt5UVY0Vm5FeXlsMDdKUWgwdWd3bnV0SkV5TlNVbHRVSTc3WlhTMkU1RG5zZTZiaHNPRjJodk8tV1E9PQ==
sorry im late to see this thank you for formulating my thouvhtsfeelings into better words than i could sum up im not in any way knocking the artist it is good work forreal i hope they continue it its just not for me and it pops up so much tot he point that i almost feel like its spambots i didnt even realize the op was the actual artist which is why i asked my question if the op is the artist i could block them and not see new posts but id still have to deal with reuploads from botsreposters so that sucks but you got the gist of what id said and spoke it for me you didnt have to do that but i appreciate it,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdrSHBZRUR2QVZ0a0dJbzR4WEtqWTU3YW5ZblZZVW9kNklGU0I1VkpMd2ZGODNUeXozWWdSUGdUNXNDakVVempZX2VZNnYySnVBTG8wVVlBVEhic25uOVE9PQ==

yeah i get it thats why i answered your question and confirmed for you glad were all on the same page now idk why this has been such a ridiculously long and heated conversation about something so basic but here we are i have zero issues if you block them or not i dont care if you love them but want a break from seeing them or you hate them and wish theyd quit art my only point outside of confirming for you that thats how block works is that telling an artist youre bored of them is a bit rude since your comment goes to their inbox anyway i really dont want to put another second of my time into this lol enjoy your cleaner reddit feed or whatever,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdrVldCQXBWOHVfQmlLSTdBeDVWaFh4dS1Pck5NcU1tZFlpa1ZkNHJDV05UVGhOTjNfQVdtT3dDc1RXWW9MTENvVTBpazhXeXVGaHBvallkajRYa3ViS0E9PQ==

well done i do want to say though that if you do not consider the viewer the audience interpretation will always be off if you had had the young woman walking away at an angle ie toward the viewer but to the right or left it would have changed the instinctual interpretation something looking or moving toward the viewer is always going to come across as confrontational or personal because humans are reactionary to things that seemingly involve themselves this is why people always seem to think portaits are looking at them despite their position relative to the photo if you try this painting at an angle instead of the woman walking toward the viewer the instinctual assumption will be that the woman is walking away from something because we can not see what she is walking toward,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PSjlpR3pZcWNBWDVQN0p0ZjFZNzBqemhHRldrWGcyZE1VQ1AzaFpVQzEwQ0VJRVFjNmRkSGs1cW5ZaWx4UEl4RTB3U2hYYURtRkR0WDhIb1QzMS0yTEE9PQ==

your execution is excellent i love the idea of literally intertwining these visual themes together and the usage of figurative form inside being collaged together but also dissolved apart its thoughtprovoking my only constructive criticism is that i would love to see more color and pattern purposefulness between the subject matter from work to work titles serve to orient us the viewers to the mood and attitude of the artwork but color shape and line also echo these ideas what invokes a feeling of unraveling i can see what direction youre headed in but i would personally love to see you push it further in palette selections and more nuanced image collage not saying you dont consider these aspects just suggesting that you can practice more restraint in selection and possibly more flexibility from traditional palettes all of your pieces that i peeked at seem to blend together in the thumbnails so more umph in distinction could lend more potency to each individual pieces message thank you for sharing i hope to see more of your work in the future and wish you success in your endeavors <<number>,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9QYjFtWUpZVDB3WExsNjFqdE1CY2N6THFkSC05aTRNeWp3R2o0Mk5ybmx2MDVQVXdrZkhaQWxsT0U4YkRzQTNsaUplbExBeGlBTTdZSkIweUI4TE1lV0E9PQ==

its definitely not a highly realistic piece but thats where its fascinating to see everyones subjective interpretations and imaginations seeing an easter color palette is one of many cool takes on the piece and i want to hear subjective perspectives as i feel like objectivity in this situation would still be a subjective creation and misleading reading other peoples reactions to my pieces really adds depth and appreciation when i view my own work even though im certain of the artists intent lol like its fun to see how differently we can view what might objectively be the same piece it can be consterning when someone sees a dick or something lol but still interesting although these really plague me specifically theres often a cool convergence of emotional reactions to the piece which excites me too so i want everyone to freely share their interpretations and know they cant get it wrong,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9SM011R1JQRjAtSDlFcTBEcFNrX3ZVMHZ2S3dTUW5kQnU4bHpiZWEzTUlFbzljTGptQmp5eDRXY0p4NjVGd3ZBZVdLVWtLMzBqYnpFcVU0UGNHOGxOX1E9PQ==

tbf it looks like you have taken your inspiration from some dragon ball series without any understanding of the source that inspired dragon ball try to not just copy the designs of these characters but to try understand why they look dress the way they do and how that may fit in a historical context say if you were to draw a medieval knight yes you could just draw a man in plated armor helmet a sword and horse but a medieval knight from the th century would look very different to a knight from the th century likewise with the warrior culture that you hope to aim for,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZaUJjcUhCZV9fZEhpa1FjbG8wclR2Y2VOSFp5cW1VTGxmUHdTRHNUVHI4TkNWdEMteGVrNW1Rb2FFSVZ1VXlpZV81VVhZSU4teTdzWWxra3phbHhpY1E9PQ==

thank you for taking the time to explore my art the idea behind my work is that you never see everything at oncetheres always something new to discover each time you look this is my first time showcasing my art on an art board though ive shared it with a few people over the years the feedback ive often received focuses on the absence of color or a specific theme some have even suggested that my work lacks imagination encouraging me to stop doodling and focus on drawing real pictures i want to explain a bit about my process and the nature of my art i have a condition called aphantasia which means i dont have a minds eyei cant visualize images in my head as a result my artwork isnt based on imagined scenes or detailed mental pictures instead my pieces emerge from random thoughts and moods guiding the art organically these creations often take months to complete and im currently working on a piece that is four times larger than my usual work i choose not to use color because for me adding color turns the work into something more cartoonish which doesnt align with my vision,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZckxxNTJ6a2ZrY1ZTdk9udjZEWUw3dFd2czB3Y3c1TURiZ3hrSUtHU25GV3hmWVVVN1lnMGMyc1Ztck1taTFGbGY4VS00LTVlR3ZOdjlmNGNHeVplYmNSZHlfaHp4VGdFbDQzMzB2NlVlTUU9

>i mean im more asking if he looks like a warrior then the answer is no it looks like you have explained what a character looks like to someone over the phone and asked them to draw it without them having no other context to go off and no amount of spiky hair will change that also the head is the wrong proportions too it needs to be bigger to fit the frame of body as it is you have drawn a small worried looking boy on to arnold schwarzenegger again rather than just at other peoples pictures and trying to copy them look at what inspired the artist to make those design choices go five layers deep if you have to just to be clear you have a creative spark here and its not my intention to extinguish anyone who tries something new but understanding creative sources does make the difference from being a generic interpretation to a unique interpretation in character design,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZMF9uMVZzdlBsX2RUY0JtX3UxZkp0V1dDMjhwZ01oOG1OWVdmb0xyMjNfSGNaUFNkc3ZyenFfXzRGRlZ1SFIwdk8xYUk0aFhGUG9hVDh4RjQwcnFmaGc9PQ==

you realize that someone behind him was hit by a bullet and killed right isnt it a strange coincidence that there was the noise of a gunshot followed by trump falling to the ground bleeding followed by someone being pronounced dead by gunshot wound on the scene idk what concrete evidence is to you but the circumstantial evidence is enough to say that there was a shooter and trump was actually shot beyond a reasonable doubt if you think trump would kill one of his own rallygoing supporters to sway a few swing voters youre out of your mind,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aQ2RvU0QtTDN0aUNWMDh1LURhZVBOVWNwb3ZCWHlUSVZlTUk3Vi1Lb2VmaUlBOUZObFRpOUhUXzNGNU5KOWZVVGNoX21pVFcxNDllNHZpTW93ZnpYSHc9PQ==

why do you keep saying that when we have the fbi saying he was shot the fbi director saying he was shot the dead body of a supporter behind trump who was in fact hit by a bullet which is pretty concrete evidence what more do you want sure you can dislike him but to believe that trump was not shot is pretty ridiculous if you cannot articulate why the evidence is insufficient or what evidence you have to believe that this was a conspiracy set up by trump himself i am forced to assume you cannot back up your own viewpoint,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9abHRhSE5Sb1BzQXhqZ1hZcUhCS2lHeDJvdVJfdGdkMGp1UnRCNG42Wm5yYW9tdFNUczFiNmZQN1J1aFlkMmMzWDk3bmR6TGZqRUVLQkNSaGltSHRlT3c9PQ==

there doesnt need to be perfect <number> concrete evidence for something in order for it to be reasonable to conclude that its true thats one of the most basic theories of statistics its known that someone fired in his direction with a gun which is not particularly accurate because the gun was identified shots were fired and several people behind trump were shot one of whom died the shooting was caught on video there was a slight amount of visible blood as would be expected bullet casings were found on the ground as well saying no concrete evidence at this point is just demonstrating your irrationality deliberately having someone fire a gun as inaccurate as the one used in his general direction would put trump in serious danger it is not reasonable to conclude that this was staged and given that there was a sizeable portion of the online community wishing he had been killed it is not unreasonable to suggest that there are a lot of people who earnestly would attempt an assassination,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aeHlnNjRHcEYtNHFac3dJZnF6X2I1WnZ2clpfazdwUlgyRlI3R204THBnZ0JwYjRuU25LeDB1UUJUMGpXbnpCaHNlM1NqZVJuNE9YTEx6VDRJeTJFaFE9PQ==

he can definitely be an artist outside of that maybe uses ai to finish his drawings so i dont think its that hard to just own a few markers and pencils and place them next to a printed image these videos and processes of drawings that end up looking ai generated are also pretty easy to fake also notice how the lines he draws in those go straight to the point not a single mistake or change of mind during the process,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAzc3VHVk0tdzVPQnpBLThHLUsyZ3lKMzlfcUwtVHRBdFZyODRSV1pWaDVXX3E1WFhCLXRrRWVWaVpwQ3VaSG5JVXVUWWtpVHlXQVdOMF9tS0xLU1ExUmc9PQ==

we will have to disagree on this from my observation this artist has an exceptionally advanced understanding of human anatomy they have stated in previous comments on their other pieces that they take creative licences for dramatic and artistic effect the art is not necessarily realistic but it is inspired by real anatomy and the level of detail demonstrates to me a highly thorough knowledge of anatomy,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTA0ZTFCSW16X2hMemlvaC1PU3V1N01YdllJOTRMcnlmN2NETDNOVlhwWGhPUzRhLWVCOTZYVlFvSF9OZFRmeHlEYzhfRTRfbkRvZjhnVjY5ZGQwd0pZdGc9PQ==

creative licences for dramatic and artistic effect yeah sure as alwasy its their style for some reason ai looking style with artifacts that ai does and mistakes that somebody sane wouldnt do even ert of people with mental ilnesses makes more sense from a technical point of view and no proofs that they did it intentionally for some reason idk maybe people lack visual experience of how ai images look in details or they dont draw and dont understand the process which cant lead to a result like this once again look at the neck for example st it absolutely does look like ai slop nd can you imagine someone deliberatly drawing bones like this when random part of them appear from nowhere blend into other random bones or just dissolve in the air and all that covered with random lines like is you know what you are drawing why makint it look like youve seen it once these three lines on the left side of the neck where ai didnt know what it should have to draw hair neck silhouette or another hai which is suspiciously followe by random unnecessary line on the jaw bone because thats what ai does it just follow patterns without understanding what it is unlike a real human ooof,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTA0a3ZKLWxla3Q2Rnc5d0pOS0FZRl9qVDNWTHlVSS14TFhBV1dfWWtXZlg2WUpEZEJuTlg4amdfTUl4SGNfMm5jWEZTY09qaXlNNGp4Y3M3Q21ibHQ4d3c9PQ==

im not really sure what to call it but it certainly isnt a data visualisation its a freehand drawing originally on a whiteboard then manipulated digitally i suppose art has no universal definition i originally posted this to rbiology where it received a much warmer reception than on this sub please tell me any suggestion you have for a subreddit that might like it,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FiUFRJNG9qa3IyYW54N1hULThFUDdKcUFNSm90MUZOMWY3S3VUZmtOakg4b3ItN01NWWRBMi13WlFfbUZNV1c4Tm1YY0lSbXh4LTJ5NUoxY21vLW1NSG5TVDNlODdEc040NDZ4WVJvdVBSNUU9

i mean i like it art is truly open definition i guess you have to tell us why you think it deserves that title most people i think associate art with a more emotional statement or a representational image so maybe the dryness of this throws people off that said in the s there were tons of really dry drawings that looked like math graphs or architectural schematics and theyre totally celebrated and exhibited in big deal institutions nobody can say no to what you make but you do have to justify it to a certain extent,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FiYjlEWHZSeENpYm1SYWNxb0hXM25YYlEyVU1ORFFSTUZ2MWFrVVVZZDdUOVM0enlBSVRaUExVRVpoSFNGa2dIdDFJR3lPcUlEeHhYNjFGYUl4cUhoVEE9PQ==

i personally feel a different title would be more impactful something a long the lines of finding a rose in the dark suffering thats too intense this is too graceful for suffering suffering is dark its not pretty its not something people enjoy looking at to portray suffering you must confront the audience with an undeniable indelible image of suffering i dare say you must disturb us this this is some goth chick that stole tuxedo masks rose dont get me wrong tho this is a sick piece dark yet detailed and the red is subtle yet its presence pops draws the eye and the woman is so graceful and her aura seems to be flowing liquid frozen motion cool a dark reprieve or something like that seems more fitting maybe a silent reprieve maybe just a gertrude stein quote is enough again just personal opinion im just an idiot on the internet,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjMm1Ram9QRHU1TndqT2FsZklzQXQ0cVR6STlRRGEzS0FOaURyVzFBbGdvZm1HbFlhY2RnSHA4VWF2Vkw2RlRxenFkQ2M1VnNkV2NFcmhDVkM4bUc3RnRXTW9wcHEteHVmNmFIa2VadmJ5VkU9

overall i really like this the distorted shadow of the figure really gives the lighting a certain instability i think is rad especially with the way the angels wings encompass the illuminated area in center of the drawing i do think that maybe the bordering darkness could play with some other hues or shading or maybe even just be more black i also think the text at the top takes away from the picture still a cool piece nice work,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjYkFLcFF4b0NrcHJNQmxqQ2ZUZ3V6MWd2S2JvTWZSUXRTUWlMQVY0R2dfVFBINTZKOHl4Mndpc3hsS1MxeHhIQmlYTFNBRTNoNjNxTWY2dTllWk4wLVE9PQ==

no problem just making it clear maybe in the future put me in the title anyhow have some comments first off i like especially the play on light and the overarching composition while of course all interpretations are up to the observer so take with a grain of salt my feedback would be it has senses of stillness and movement that conflict with each other and im not huge on the palette of the figure laying down also the sizes feel not quite right taking into account that this could reflect both a stylistic choice and a play on the emotional perspective of one of the two people in the work itself for example her right hand seems disproportionate with respect to the rest of the work either way these dont detract as much as i made it sound and its a good piece overall,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3Fkb0VvZDUxdldzTXk4X1JXbF9NSXRQRk1SSXNtQ3VNelVHTmplTUkxQTVxUnNNODBJdGk5WUdSNUlMeUd6WFJBTF83cHY1eU9FYm10OVZMaTZPdlNsZzliSy1OZTJidTFndGtMT203Ymc5UTA9

i have been following your progress with your paintings for a while and am constantly suprised with how you manage to still add even more amazing techniques to your composition i was amazed when i first saw your lovely scratching techniques for the skies then you started doing works with cool clouds and terrain made out of thick pallette knife blotches and i didnt think you could really innovate more from there but now you have added some kind of contrasting triangular lines that act like little abstract spotlights and i dont even know how you would have done those with how everything else was laid out was it some kind of thin water diluted layer to make them stand out,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FmMHk1SUdKRlhOaFBXUmpHamlhY2xJTlM5eERCS0dKcVUyY01yTzZNbXByQW5CWVQ3OHJhWGcwbTBDbk5zRkdieTdKdUN5VkJ5eGJWTXF3ZlZIbE9NWUE9PQ==

hmm if you are serious about art critique will come whether you ask for it or not agreeing with the one person who sides with you and dismissing all other comments wont get you very far some comments were on the rude side but do you want to defend a piece by making up scenarios in your favour ie maybe shes on a hill and there are buildings below or simply take the critique for what it is an honest judgment of what other people see when they look at this learn from it and on your next piece you can simply appreciate the feed back try not to side with the one fuck everyone else comment or only the nice onesit holds you to yah its perfectly fine the way it is and you dont grow as an artist,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FmZmN3UDNtZTdoTVU0YWhjVVdEcXNoeERuczNzWUt2cEI0MTliN0dTWE50VUZRWV83YWZTTkFjcFZMN2NQcjdpNmlhX3VDQmtHbkJOb242SnRhRHh6S3pCLVo0czJYYmhOVnBsQUhhczJBc0E9

she wasnt an advocate of people remaining in poverty rather that our focus should be on heavenly goods she herself and her sisters chose to be poor like the people they administered to she ran a hospice hospice is for the dying its like when the doctor tells someone they have <number> months to live theres nothing to be done she strove to give them a compassionate death surrounded by people who loved them because of the cast system in india at the time the poorest people were considered less than dirt untouchable she literally went and picked dying people up off the street and gave them a bed and as much care as she could give they freely gave out as much medicine and pain killers as they could but these things were gifts to her and her sisters so if they ran out there was none to give out if anyone wanted to give money to the poor she would accept it it didnt matter who it was from it was going to help the dying she sought no attention for herself and constantly turned down opportunities to give speeches and rub elbows with the rich because she thought her duty was to be with the poor and help them when she was given the nobel prize for peace she melted it down and sold it she was an amazing woman,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTmowTlJKSGtPbjVaY2x6SnlERWdfRHloN0dTeHBodVlkd3EyV2NTZFY2WUNDT1RhejYwZUlfMmZDdWV6N19yQTNsdFRudkI1cnFnNVJxQWFBelp1UkE9PQ==

the artists perspective is what if mother teresa was a war maker he also had other peaceful personalities like gandhi with a bazooka in miami where he was asking what if gandhi chose violence instead of peace and nonviolence in case of mother teresa the take is misinformed she was an evil person she got billions of dollars in the s and s and funneled it all to one of the most corrupt banks in the vatican where a lot of bad people send money to wash it all this money which she got in the name of helping the poor never reached any poor people the poor died in pain and with subhuman treatment where her only purpose was to trick them into accepting jesus christ as their savior and convert them into christians she wouldnt even give them painkillers let alone any proper meds apart from basic first aid even if they were suffering from extreme health conditions and she had proper access to cures shed let them die among her other acts of evil she wrote a letter to a judge in california presiding over a case where a priestdirector of a church was caught sexually abusing children for years the judge dropped the case and the man continued his heinous crimes for another decade she also was very controlling of the nuns who used to volunteer there she used to not let them wear anything except fully covered sarees and used to make them work for more than <number> hours a day all days of the week she used to keep them from meeting their families and made them abstain from any kind of sexual acts there is much more but you get the idea,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnemh2LU96eWtRUTBfR3kzMlJtWlMyUjdobVotMzFuNmlvczZsczY5QlQxekV3LWxCb1A0YnNabzlscmNRbjFPMVhMcmFXMTctV1hORzJTMm9DSjhIVjlkYmJnY0pBWHRhMGVLZE1EY1RlbzQ9

i asked about the word save since many would use it to refer to saving souls very well that was not your intent but what did she do to prevent or alive illness and disease she had soup kitchens and hospices in the later they kind of just prayed over people that were dying for the amount of money that went to her charities how much soup made it into anyones bellies at best she ran a wasteful and corrupt charity that primarily benefited the catholic church and her own order to be fair lots of charities around the world most certainly including in the us are just as corrupt and ineffective but they should all be called out for their deceptions as well there are many hundreds of millions of dollars completely unaccounted for to all appearances it just ends up in the vatican treasury,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNodkZuaHV6VXY3Y05rX1R3b1RKTXA4dGx4VlNkUG5yNFpicXlUclpJbmZnRlBjZU1nT1lZYjVkUXB2M3o1ZXhkaGxSMXJ2RDlvZXpGYkhlZUt2eVVLSFE9PQ==

ignoring the fact that we dont really have numbers and figures to judge her inefficiency of spending with the fact is that objective good was done and without her thousands and thousands would have gone hungry had <number> access to medicine and more orphans would not have shelter in poverty stricken areas like india in the s but if we want to make the argument that she was a pos because of monetary inefficiency what then is the bar for shit person and what percentage of the money has to go directly to aid for them to be considered good person i think whats more important than worrying about where every penny is going to is recknognizing that despite that inefficiency no one else was trying to help the poor like theresa in the region again its nice to sit here nearly <number> years later and call her a shit person but the reality is still that thousands and thousands would have been much worse off and would have had worse lives if not for her actions id rather good be done and us be able to sit here this far after the fact criticizing how that money was spent than for us to sit here talking about the fact that nobody did anything and the poor continued to get <number> help just thousands more orphans who died without food in their stomachs thousands of sick who got no help at all but hey at least we know where our precious money is,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoLTZiMm5Vbi1Od09POXh1cGVpenRmZHRkLVU5bGloVGJSdUxTaGt1R3BPZW4xSVh6TVpKZTRISThIeHpoMll2NUF4ZC11elFBbGcxVGhYcEpJbWlRU2c9PQ==

>ignoring the fact that we dont really have numbers and figures to judge her inefficiency of spending id say the total lack of transparency is a very very relevant fact it is considered unacceptable for any legitimate charity for example from interviews with former sisters we know that in just one year from just their new york house they garnered more than <cur><number> million in donations thats one admittedly affluent location which in effect was most of their us presence and one year not a single cent is accounted for because the organization flatly refuses to share its books under any circumstances there is literally zero reason for that refusal if they are operating anywhere close to legitimately the only thing close to financial reporting i can find is from the indian fcra which requires reports from ngos on foreign income being deposited in indian banks but that can only show us that sums are reaching india not how much was originally collected and further it is just a snapshot of account balances and does not inquire into what is done with the money what percentage hell <number> would at least be out there accomplishing something but you can provide no evidence that even that much is being done because they are not operating honestly no evidence either way exists because they are keeping secrets where it is generally understood there should be transparency,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoN2QyaFZTczltb1FyX2ZwNkthbGpzZEJmQnN5bWx5SDQxdkkxTHNGSzdvdTVCOEkzYlQ2d3ZTU2x5MW5Wa0ZTSkFtMVFlLVA3RDkwMnNERks1VmxjbWc9PQ==

unacceptable for legimitimate charities today in the early mid th century there was no standard like this in place or demand for transparency all that really mattered to anyone was that someone was helping and using their resources for that for which im sure again thousands who were helped are very thankful assuming that just because they didnt report income in a time where this wasnt a standard means they were grossly misusing that money is the same as assuming that they spent <number> of it on good causes we simply do not know but what we do know is that thousands were fed bed and provided medical care and while modern day they should be transparent again people arent calling her a pos because she didnt report where every penny she received went theyre calling her a pos because they think she worshipped pain and loved dictators and they got that from the clearly biased hitchens who is now a certified bad history concontributor,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNodkd4b05xai04WkFoT0dPcVNfWjN3YnpCelBSN0Nxb0NJOWxOR004bUYzOEFzVkpWS1V2allMU3luRzFTaE5EZTRqRm43bU90eS1KcHU2Q3JBNzhpRFE9PQ==

the claims of her preventing the unwell from seeking medical help is misinformed at best she ran a hospice for those who are dying not a hospital the idea of intentionally not giving pain medications is also false they were under supplied many of the claims about her that come from hitchens come from the fact that hitchens hated religion more than he sought the truth and many of his claims involve him intentionally misquoting others who actually visited and evaluated the conditions of her hospice,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoVUJrSGlYX3pfVkZ4VW41R1ZfM0JhTUx3YVkzVHExTTN0ZWhBVThGS3U5b0xXQ0l5TFhEeWhNVTg3OVJRVkxHUDRILXhrVXRfMUVkUS1TbzlsSXV2OHF3OFIwOVNVNEZRNXRweEhkZGtCRk09

personally i havent looked into the claims one way or another but i agree much of that take is just overly excited pop atheists repeating stuff that sounds good so they can keep stuffing religious people into a box thats easy to dismiss but it seems to be an increasingly popular sentiment and its just what my mind went to when i saw the statue also clarified that i was just guessing gladly that was not directly the artists intent from what another commenter said theres a lot of gray area in the world and i can believe her work may have fallen into that gray area i wasnt there i never met her but i also agree the complete demonization of her story and her work seems a little zealous at least,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoVWFoaE40cWhXM0U1MWY2SUtZbnQyay1NRDB2ejd2ZFJWdUtfUDV0QlI5Y3RLUmw0cFNHRlh5Wkx0MzFxNXZ2ZmVoamhIbFRwRzc3VUY4MUJJaXZnNlE9PQ==

i think she was actually an early visible case of celebrity derangement syndrome she became a caricature of what she should have stood for trotting the globe with a hand out and saying shit that only made sense to her so many of her quotes are so easily criticized because she just said a lot of shit she was operating from a lexicon of concepts the catholic faith that never made any sense to begin and she kept regurgitating it over and over again for decades until it became word soup because her actions were based in irrational nonsense as her fame grew all those paradoxes of her faith grew more and more stark visibly incompatible with reality heres a paradox of her faith the world operates by gods will the world is full of pain and suffering pain and suffering is gods will god is the source of all that is holy pain and suffering are holy its not just because of something she once said that can be twisted it is a line of reasoning built into her faith a line of reasoning that most are savvy enough to avoid following but that celebrity derangement kind of removed the rails from her thinking and words i dont think she worshipped pain consciously on a daily basis but i also think that if you asked her is pain the will of god and holy she would answer yes because thats what her faith in fact says the pope himself would stumble over the question and equivocate i want to point out that her charities still exist today and still collect millions in donations and still have zero transparency,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoc2xKM2Fab2pzSE4yTXNZZU1YMnprVTc5UGw2N3F0eWo0bzhEcTA2QTg1b3M1SllEWW1fM20waWlHdGcwMEJkZGdtYjJfVThDUkdLWUdUX0F0UWZPZ2c9PQ==
this was the second of three pieces displayed for my balloon art exhibition messengers the show highlighted three mysterious bringers of truth and wisdom whose motives are meant to be viewed through a critical lens half the work of coming up with ideas is staying receptive to inspiration the inspiration for the scribe came from an image here on reddit of a lava cave in hawaii that had the look of a pit opening straight to hell with the souls of the damned being dragged under looks rad has religious connotations and most importantly a chance to do something interesting with the lighting i wanted each piece to feel like its own fully formed artwork so unique lighting was a must i turned to demonology for more inspiration incorporating my practice of satanism as a reinforcement of the themes of caution against jumping to conclusions based on aesthetics modernday satanism is not about satan as a real existent entity its about valuing humanistic ethics and highlighting the hypocrisy of christian nationalists i pulled inspiration from gamigin who sometimes takes the form of an anthropomorphic horse with multiple sets of arms along with the pale spindliness of gollum given this would be a cavedwelling creature i imagined the creature as a moses character retreating to an out of reach locale to bring back a message transcribed from an unknowable source thus was born the scribe the transference of ancient wisdom through individuals across history is an inevitably corrupting and distorting force a fact that messengers of such wisdom work hard to belie,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoQ1I3N0VIcXVCSjBWTWJtc3J5bTQyYXlOZk9JUjlwN2JzdHMyLXVMN1dpc0JFTC1IeU5kclNYUk1nTENMaDdLTXg3Uk9CLVBSUzRhRjJhYUlWR1JJcHc9PQ==

as a landscape the framing and shadowing are so odd that you end up with a lot of visual noise and nowhere for your eyes to rest in the center is a person trying to be the focus of the image but it ends up just working into the background and becoming part of the noise with the only actual highlights on the person being the typically sexualized female curves the entire effect is what is this oh probably an onlyfans ad,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzM0IwVDdTTHlOUmdGZ0FTMG9UajdyYm5FVHlUZTh2cmgwOTZfQ1VKUGhKQ3hvTnphdzNrMUZjcGRlbEhUTG81ZmVxYTd6WVBkcTVwRTA3bGx6VkotY0E9PQ==

this comment was intended to be feedback on the construction and impact of landscape photography from the perspective of a layperson with a deep appreciation for the emotional impact of art although art is created with an intention by its creator a huge part of art is how the viewer interprets it differently this is how i personally reacted and it seems a large number of others did too take it as feedback or criticism tho to each their own,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzYXBmLVRpb1JOdzg4UlV3WW1Na0luVVFjb3llVC1UMTZYSUVWQ25ReHFzMWRzYVk4a1VpSEZJTnhFZWc5djF3aENOOUpnLWloU20xWHlwckdGQlJPZ2c9PQ==

i dont see a lot of views expressed by the liberal extremists as inherently liberal they want to jail people for not using their correct pronouns disarm everyone and are equally quick to try to cancel people they dont like as the right is sometimes its justified but sometimes its over drinking starbucks i think intentionally misgendering people is stupid and petty but jailing someone for speech you dont like is not liberal and completely disarming the populous is also not necessarily a liberal idea these are things dictators do ive seen obvious liberals being called conservative over their view on gun issues the things that now qualify someone as liberal has been reduced to a few key issues that either effect a very small percentage of the population or alienate a large group of both parties that and the lack of action on the part of the democratic party on the things that would help the country as a whole push people away from the party and make them indifferent to the outcome of elections the conversation now isnt vote for the party that will do the most good its about voting for the lesser of two evils while trying to forget were still choosing evil,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzUGpJWVVUWDJFRml6STNRMHBLclVoTlNLdFc2d1ppMUZYMEN0UDdudS1hM19JQmc3Nm5rNmczUGZ2VVBWdWhZZkd6UFpza2dqZXZlSDMwVElfUW5WR0E9PQ==

see it only takes one viewpoint for someone to be barred from being a liberal again im not saying thats a mainstream liberal view its an extreme liberal view expressed by an extreme minority but blown up to distract people from real issues and and push people further right and with the lack of personal research people do it propagates im also not a centrist but i dont give a singular fuck about social issues when it comes to things you choose to express vs things you cant not express such as race everyone needs to suppress some aspect of their identity in order not offend or make other people uncomfortable and i believe forcing your religion sexuality political views or anything else into the public is tacky and disrespectful whether you have a rainbow flag or a trump flag on the back of your car you look like a jackass thats trying to to get a reaction from stupid people,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzRlE5YTY4Nm9NRjJrVWFQN09wb1BzSmVfbHVRQXlSeGw4YzQ0cWtfeHV5ZkhmOU9ZVDEyaWlHVzJENkpPbC1wM0lrWjJ4QnpULXl2VkV3Ul94UTRPQmc9PQ==

you do see the irony in calling me close minded while taking offense to someone not adhering specifically to your views right i personally am perfectly fine calling people whatever they want to be called but i find forcing other people to do the same as a waste of effort and resources and in many cases counterproductive as hateful people tend to double down on hate instead of admitting they are wrong i find it most productive to just ignore them they dont matter hopefully those kinds of people die soon and their ideas with them i believe the energy would be better spent making sure these ideas cant be fostered into the future by banning home and private schooling or at least making their diplomas worthless and making education funding equal for everyone instead of just based off the areas the schools are in punishing bad behavior is less effective and more difficult than supporting good behavior,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0eU10N054QmlGQW9CRWZMbzUteDJrcVotUjhtMmViS19ZbXVwMmN0enFCQUlua2ZxWTN4dGNfVEZreEoyZ0lCNXBPaW03RzRRRW5HNkZ0U0NGejhnc0E9PQ==

whatever you say my whole point is everyones views are equally as valid and they should have the right to believe them i wouldnt say i think their reasonable but that doesnt make them any less valid religion is in no way based on reason but you should be able to believe in it if you want being able to hold your own beliefs is kinda the backbone of freedom your view seems to be no ones views are valid but your own which is exactly what the right believe about their own views to think that everyone needs to suppress their own beliefs in order to placate an extreme minority is not a liberal stance its authoritarian,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0cTlETktKUWprallETXBWWWJORURSR2ZhNy1KdmlLbnZkbDNvRkJsQnQtYXc0amN1dEZuLTFpMkNnYWh0LVJVaVYzVlNRTzgyQm5sWVRNRFB2T3lHN1E9PQ==

watching the documentary crumb <number> about maxons brother robert for the first time the other day i was utterly glued to the screen for most of the running a lot of the artwork in the film is fascincating but i was particularly struck by maxs artwork to me it portrays a great deal of suffering and a profound abdunance of creativity a link with deep subconscious thought processes when you see max on film it is difficult not to feel uncomfortable a tortured artist with dark past i wonder if any of you have recommendations for similar artwork and whether this type of art has a name or genre many thanks,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN1aGk4SHpocHUwT2xUcEhldjh4WTI0SFlwVWdfYVpiSjRvTzRqR2hDQkhKR3VqcllEOHNwZERxZzN4WlYwRkI2LWN6RFVMNEpNZlFZejFRYklQcThSNWc9PQ==
