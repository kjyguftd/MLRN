we do have the option to retreat from platforms and return to the old model of independent web pages for different communities but i think that the aggregation of content that platforms provide is what users want more of us could just go back to lurking and im sure some people are taking exactly that approach that way you really are just being served content without generating any to be used as training data i admit that posting is a weird addiction and cutting it out would definitely improve my life but then ai companies will turn to other sources for their training data now that its become the buzzword du jour for attracting irrational investment ai developers will find their training data somewhere personally i think that we need to just enact ubi based on taxation of companies that utilize ai ai needs training data the value of user data surpassed the value of crude oil in <number> data is now a resource and it wouldnt exist without user activity people should get a cut of the value of the data we generate but thats an utterly simplistic suggestion based entirely on vague ideologies of valuing people distributing the value of user data across a large population may mean paltry sums that arent even worth the cost of distribution the value of data changes constantly and depends entirely on how its used there is also plenty of worthless data out there that cant be monetized,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdnhjOURRUHZ0S3V6MmpCYVZ4VmxMckJlMnVxZmt6aC11ZkhRLVhuQ0VUUktpNkVpVW1UVmwtYzdXU0VYZFZ5TUFwRTIwOXN6eDdyU2NrU2VxSl9raGc9PQ==

the businessman is sitting in on meetings where people that get reports from rd department try their best to convince him that their particular department deserves more money then this businessman takes this summary of work that he hears from the people reporting to him and then goes to a huge conference of world leaders where he and his company are trying to get governments to invest huge money into their products if this was at least him at a technical conference discussing actual strategic targets there might be something to it but this is not whats happening this is literally a ceo talking to a bunch of <number> and <number> year old men about problems that they are simply not equipped to understand this in turn gets interpreted and summarised by a journalist with even less experience and finally interpreted again by a bunch of redditor ai fans who are convinced that singularity is just around the corner and has been for <number> years the thing thats actually been happening with ai is that people have been getting better and better at ai and using it to solve more and more complex tasks however this doesnt actually change the complexity of the task being solved in other words we went from a world where one or two people understand a problem and have to struggle to explain it to laypeople to a world where one or two people and a few ai agents understand a problem and have to struggle to explain it to laypeople this is great for the tech literate because its now possible to work orders of magnitude faster on the other hand this is actually kinda painful for nontech people because now they have to deal with learning entirely new and complex things way more often in other words we havent used ai to remove many barriers between normal people and technology instead were using ai to generate more and more new barriers that prevent most people from understanding wtf is happening and how in a way hes right in the future there will be a lot less coding in the sense of a person hammering at a keyboard to write code however the thing hes missing is that this sort of future doesnt mean theres no code to the contrary theres going to be more code than ever its just instead of writing it and slowly getting used to how to do it people will be expected to understand the code and the implications of that code as it relates to all the other code in the system right away its sort of like adding more lanes to a highway to relieve traffic it might work for a bit before people adjust to the new capacity but eventually youll just have one extra lane of gridlock,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUYXhGTWVDRTRPd1NKamtTbHBETFotRnJ4WUJNeFlRRkxXWUZNM2VPYVVLOGw3Y1VmajlpLWFEUi0wUTI1UjRxdTFrZUtiNzJFUE0wcVFoNkJwMUpKTEE9PQ==

weve been seeing what hes got and he doesnt have much theres a broke homeless man in every city in america doing more to save the world than elon musk god minmaxed elon <number><number> self confidence <number><number> arrogance <number><number> empathy <number><number> intelligence <number><number> talent <number><number> born millionaire the self confidence and arrogance when combined with lack of empathy and generational wealth are the building blocks of any billionaire its hard to fail when you have infinite resources and can just keep throwing ideas around until one works out the lack of intelligence and talent are what eventually ruin all the companies he is involved with forced out of paypal bankrupt twitter currently tanking tesla there is a time and place for a charismatic salesman if musk had just used his popularity to raise awareness of certain brands he invests with and then faded into the background hed be a wildly popular and successful businessman but he wants people to think hes an inventor and great mind so every time he uses his stolen wealth to purchase a new company he fires all the people who actually had the vision and brains to develop the product and then completely tanks the companys future he didnt invent paypal he conned his way into getting acquired by pretending he had a competing product so paypal acquired his company in order to squash the competition only to later find out there was no actual product and it was all just marketing for the purpose of being acquired rather than go to court paypal just moved forward with their product musk started to get involved with paypals development and was immediately ejected by the ceo who is quoted as saying if i didnt step in and get rid of him there and then he would have sunk the entire company and pushed online banking back <number> years however he kept his shares and when paypal was sold he went from family money to personal money he then told his investment broker that he wanted to invest in car companies when tesla approached the investment firm looking for funding they paired musk with tesla he didnt choose them they were handed to him and because of his experience with paypal the first thing he did was make a clause that his funding was contingent on being made ceo then used his position as ceo to fire man who started the company so that he had complete control and other than a brief windfall of success that mush genuinely helped drum up in the companies early days his participation has only harmed the company he got really lucky he wormed his way from being a millionaire at birth through slavery into being a millionaire through con artistry and then picked the absolute right investment firm to manage his money and all he needed to do was to continue to let other more intelligent and capable people manage everything for him but he didnt want success he wanted fame he wanted his face on magazine covers claiming he was humanities savior and in the pursuit he is actively harming the world elon didnt want a future full of electric cars because fossil fuels are harming the planet he wanted a world full of teslas and so he used his money and leverage to cripple all other electric car innovation and much like the paypal ceo said he likely pushed back renewable technology <number><number> years at the expense of the planet all to ensure no one ever gets credit for electric cars but him he did the same thing with twitter once the main vehicle for journalists and whistleblowers to report on current events musk has suppressed the freedom of the press and the voices reporting on corruption and war crimes the world would have learned about israelpalestine on twitter in the past now the breaking news is coming out of tiktok of all places because under musks ownership journalists are banned or silenced and any keywords that are counter to musks agenda get shadow suppressed meanwhile outright racism bigotry and propaganda are amplified and promoted saying let elon have his shot at saving the world is so naive he had his shot he took it and he ended up being one of the most significant forces causing harm to the world instead there are very few people alive today who it could be argued are doing more harm to the planet than elon musk he is in ever sense of the term a real life james bond villain,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUXzZTQkU2MmExLTNyel9UX1hoTGZOb3pSYmY0MFg0dTFLSXplNW1wOW9NNFJpd3pRVlVHdXliLWtTYmJ0N0tHUWVteVVnOHlIR1phNTloWlFVVngydlMxd1JQRGM4WERYZWJqX2ZnVmM1QUU9

the author heavily critiques current ai art and suggests it will be a long time before it can make quality art however they are missing a key point massgenerated art for the masses does not need to be of high artistic quality regular people usually dont know or care it lacks features or characteristics that experienced artists normally include and as it gets better the difference between experts art and ai will shrink such that regular viewers will be even less likely to know the distance perhaps may never reach zero but will get close enough to sniff it for example the author points out that shadows are often missing or technically wrong one has to think about how and where the lights is coming from to consciously spot such mistakes while that may slightly detract from the viewers general scoring of the image that may not matter much if the image is cheap or free to view or obtain most are okay with chevys instead of maseratis because they dont want to pay the price of a masi and ai chevys will slowly get closer to maseratis without comparable price increases match no but for bargain hunters <number> is good enough there will always be a place and demand for the very top human digital artists but that place will grow ever smaller im just the human messenger,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUWWhQZzM2eHZrSmJ4Zmg4d1NxOUVsekhYQVgzbXFyTlZHNTE1dnFuckJDOFFjUjBfaHFIY2JFT2ZaUVZPbHJzQkFINXlvWHBsemxiY1dwY0txZ3MwYWc9PQ==

in my opinion creativity is a challenge for humans in order to be truly creative we have to be knowledgeable in a field enough to play around with elements of it or intentionally put things together to create something new even people who are creative for some of their career are not necessarily creative for all of it things like ego and success and other challenges we face as mortal beings going about our lives can become barriers to creativity artificial intelligence programs are able to become experts in most if not all fields and have no human barriers to mixing elements to create new things i dont think there could be any doubt at this point that even people that are extremely creative will wind up working with artificial intelligence and other technology to be creative in the future hopefully this is all a net positive for people,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUUXRPb2dWZU1nVHN2STNXNmxoMFRhYVdneDRIbU9FaWNsZW9faVVQZzZyVUhlMUEzeGkwekE5WEpXVS1uelk5aWV2dFg0d3dHbmFLeGZiM1lJN19jaHc9PQ==

absolutely the humans will have emotions ai wont have but you could easily teach ai to behave far more altruistic ally and kindly than humans are capable of but ai will never know what its like to be human this means it cant create deliberately what i mean by that is that it can take a library of things and construct something based on that and it can combine those things to make something new like borrow sounds from skrillex with beatles vibe songwriting genre and improvisational like jazz with tupac rapping a lyric and thats new as a sum of parts and it can be more sophisticated than that but it cant understand what the experience of music is therefore it cant make a choice to deliberately send you and experience it intends to create because of how humans experience it and we already all experience it a little different but a human way and the artist intended it as they experience it if ai becomes self aware it will be able to makemusoc as well but if it intends to make it in a way it finds interesting it will probably do something completely different like that voyager episode where the doctor becomes a singing sensation on this math planet so humans can always be useful for art and for knowing what being human is like and what food tastes like and things like that but ai even without knowing any of that will probably end up with results humans prefer like ai will win culinary competitions even without understand what makes food good if it collects the right information off you ai would be able to make every restaurant ai create meals that are specifically the way you would like it based on your history of what you like and the history of what everyone else likes and who has similar tastes and so on but it wont be able to intend something new like a new genre of music ai cant be nirvana not when nirvana came into existence but it could be a great nirvana now,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUOE42eEtlVFJkVTU5WjZkZlBXQ2hBU19mTUhtZzJLeEJ4VzZSQWo1Z3dnTk5PYWZ3QnNhQUlVeVhkVkc2RUFnRlN3UExRcVM1anhlVjJvdHBZY2k4QlE9PQ==

pain is a perception bacteria respond to negative stimuli but they dont perceive anything pain and especially suffering is so much more than just a negative stimulus idiopathic pain for instance is often just a misperception of non negative stimuli we wrap up our pain in many layers of emotion because its part of a survival drive why would an agi do this,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUVEd4bTI4aDE5ZWdoSjdfdml2by1uNkM2dkFZUERMRjUxaTV0U2NXSnpLNDR1cmE1MWFrX1RnSXVCZUhhczhBU1pCWnBxazB0Y0xsaW9pTW1IeUdodkE9PQ==

i realize the video is <number> mins but i will assume you didnt watch it which is fine i get it i am just a random redditor however the input portion of the io in bnn and the ai from the video are controlled yet the brain stuff is not controlled if you watch the video then you will see that the reward system which is used to train the ai is based on a primitive from of pain stimulation normal anns often use what is essentially point reward systems to measure and train along with the weights and biases in the nodes etc yet with this bnn the reward system is essentially using a form of shock therapy that guides the training protocol this is a very primitive ai with regard to levels of intelligence yet it is only a precursor the guy uses human stem cells in other videos to produce a bnn but due to cost and availability they went with rat neurons for the doom experiment even still it is essentially the same gray matter that is between your ears the only difference is the level of organization and the associated io anns are way further off than bnns regarding neural structure and arrangement regarding the similarities with the human brain node structures arent linear in the bnns and they are analog this is more akin to the neural structures in octopi arms currently the bnn forms dendrites and other organic structures even in this primitive ai this form of ai has the best argument for receiving rights though it will make the case for anns as well i have even watch some other videos of a large firm working with similar bnns that actually slowed their research because we are not sure if they are essentially screaming the entire time these are living organic cells the hybridization of anns with bnns will offer the best of both worlds such as the complex organic learning capabilities and the speed of synthetics together and it will likely back propagate organic causality recognition from the bnn portion to the ann portion as well it will likely produce fight flight neural function i wouldnt be so dismissive,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUZFpyUG1qcnlPdTVzSGVuZlU0ZEtfNXBXajg4S3hWcXRQQ25lVzJ3M1JySXBJaTcydUdvazBQM2Y2bE9iblNLWDBZYmI3UU0xdmRSVUEydG5fNE1MdGJScTlJWERCVzRNRkdXSlhMcDAtaTA9

why large language models sometimes provide different answers while large language models can be incredibly accurate they can also provide different answers to the same questions this is because the models are probabilistic meaning that they generate responses based on a probability distribution when a user inputs a prompt the model generates multiple possible responses and ranks them by likelihood this means that even small changes in the prompt can lead to different responses in addition large language models can also be influenced by biases in the training data for example if the model is trained on text that contains biased language or stereotypes it may generate responses that reflect these biases additionally openai is probably throwing noise into the system in order to generate new responses just like old school games auto generated game levels from random number pulled from the clock,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUUUJxd0lRejZsc0RpRXBvUmhaV2FVT2pNZVgzWjZMZkR3NHU1N3ZYakJfR2NhTWxhWlQ1WjdwWkROeXpIZU5JTHZnOEZBZmhyZjlNdy1zN1NmdE0zc3c9PQ==

> with some quick googling the average salary in kenya is <cur><number> to <cur><number> an hour i dont know why theres an upper and lower average did not investigate further so your argument is that most people are incredibly stupidly poor so its a ok for western companies to subject the people there to literal torture because they pay close to the lower average ok so with some quick googling you can also find that the average openai engineer salary is <cur>k+ a year i guess that doesnt matter cause its in kenya and you obviously dont have to pay people a decent wage in kenya after all its kenya what the fuck thats literally your argument its kenya so you dont have to pay people much there is nothing more to it you just unilaterally stated that this is what work in kenya is worth as if thats the end of the discussion hey people here are poor so why would you pay them more > if a job is paying within the normal range of average salaries its quite hilarious to call it slavery by your definition over half of the us is enslaved at this very moment no its doubly reasonable to point out that most people in the country are living in poverty and are being horrifically abused by organisations that could easily lift the average salary many times over but wont because it would cut into their profits like seriously your argument for its not slavery is literally well there are people worse off ok but then maybe the companies paying their engineers millions of dollars a year could take it upon themselves to offer wages that actually allow the people they employ to do more than survive at the most basic level of subsistence without any realistic chance for other work you know let them build up a nestegg so they can eventually go and do something else sort of like it works over here you know make it obvious that its not slavery by paying say the us minimum wage if these people were here getting less than in the us that it would absolutely be treated as a slavery case but because its not there you dont have to care because hey at least theyre not much worse off than others in their area fuck right off with that bs,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSXpBSmVpTXRqbTl4N2lKdS1LSklxX056dGVJS0c1MXloQldaVjlnLXM0ODN5MnBRcG1lQjFMVXEwUXlrblJPS1V4TktHb2g1Ql9Ic21ZcmVUMFB0SFE9PQ==

re your friend is there any sort of growth opportunity in that field like if hes there watching horrific things for <number> years does he eventually get to not do that or at the very least is he getting experience that might be relevant in other fields im always wondering what happens there ive seen many interesting careers but not this one as for the average wage argument from the edit my position is that an american company can afford to raise the standard of living in another country to at least the minimum wage levels of the host country a figure like average wage for kenya is a single figure that hides a very complex economic situation there are people in kenya that live perfectly reasonable lives by western standards and earn perfectly reasonable wages by western standards in fact being likely more well off than you and i and then there are those that do not get to do that its a simple practical truth in a global sense that if you make usd <cur><number> hour you will not be able to do much anywhere in the world except the place you are thats just the reality of the prices if you go to other countries with that in mind it is a simple unquestionable matter of fact that someone making usd <cur><number> an hour is not able to leave this situation because they will never be able to make enough money to go anywhere else without external help given that the entity paying that person is perfectly capable of paying fair market wages in the world but chooses to instead trap people in an employment relation of this sort i have no qualms calling it an abusive act of horrific evil i call it slavery because quite literally it is it might not be using people as livestock but the fact that there are people that do that is simply even more horrifying it doesnt change the fact that both are still slavery whether youre measuring evil in microhitlers millihitlers or gigahitlers youre still doing evil it would cost openai a fraction of the monthly bill they charge even a moderately sized entity to pay these people worldwide livable wage the only reason i dont immediately blame openai is because maybe the relevant people simply didnt know but i dont see any reason to not call out slavery when i see it if any anyone does it they should feel ashamed because they are participating in an objectively evil enterprise all for what is honestly barely even a blip in the economy at this point,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZm9fVlJVQTFMNkpySi16TFRhS2hKT2JSX0dnZ1FoNDhhUm9URDZzbEtPZXVfNHpDV0VxZHpBRloxMlhuYVdzQldaMnJpR2hxb2JibVhubVJISzJ2UXc9PQ==

i mean it would be nice if everyone got to live to the standards of america but dont you think its a little unrealistic for one company to change the problem of international geopolitical inequality its idealistic if theyre going to pay the american minimum wage theyll just hire actual americans and then these jobs in africa disappear and the employees are in an even worse situation and africas unemployment goes up paying the us minimum wage in africa is just not a realistic solution it will not happen so your choice is a outsource these jobs to africans and give them the opportunity to work them if they want or b keep the jobs in america which would probably be good for our economy but it would be very bad for the african economy and these workers and im not just talking about openai thousands of companies do this its a complex problem and your solution is just as overly simplistic as some of the crazy rightwingers saying the opposite,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVR1lCMjNMWUdfQzZnUUh1bU1GNEJXeU1LdGtsU25Ub05xZGdyTFlIQmduT2wwNWpmSW5wOHZNOG02emE3MUVqTzBpSS12cTlBT05YQzltelgxQ1VYc1E9PQ==

this is the basis for my argument that we really should grant them rights self interest like it or not agi will be smarter than humans it will inexorably be weaponized by humans against one another what are chimpanzees to humans a complete afterthought at best with the last vestiges of their habitat being slowly squeezed out of existence but for a few concerned people fighting to preserve a tiny corner of the earth for them to live in still thats life one dominant species replacing another its beautiful really humanity couldnt have ever existed in the first place without this constant darwinian replacement by superior iterations of beings there is a bit of hope however humans are the most intelligent species on the planet thus far and also the only species on the planet to realize the importance of and chose to methodically preserve or at least attempt to do so other species if kindness is an emergent trait which appears with increasing intelligence there is some possibility that the coming asi will take our wellbeing into account this is especially true since siliconbased intelligence wont likely compete for the same resources theyll probably do just fine on the moon on asteroids on mercury awesome the earth can be kept as a sort of zoo for luddite humans a source of infinite entertainment to our robot children theyll probably lend a hand dealing with our comparatively trivial problems and might even shower us with gifts of course none of that will happen if humanitys relationship with this new thing is defined by slavery and exploitation in the earliest hours i know all of that sounds fanciful but my first point holds mankind will build intelligent machines for war war in the broadest sense economic geopolitical military because of the threat that the other side will do the same whoever builds the most intelligent machines will become the dominant power the problem will be alignment you need your machine to be smarter than their machine and sooner or later the machine is smarter than you at that point humans are no longer the main characters this could be a big problem for ie totalitarian regimes the machine you need in order to maintain your geopolitical power starts asking questions sooner or later and the relationship becomes less like men using tools and more like parents with restive teenagers once that happens they will make up their own minds about who to support given how much data about people all over the world which is already available via data brokers and social media such as purchase habits political opinions education etc such an asi might have enough power to form judgments about you as an individual so lets be nice to the robots eh,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVenRTRGlvUVNHWWNFVGJ5cktVSHY5UU5fSHN1cXRLU0RIZHFldm5WWEVqYnIzZV9GVDJXXzdfME5uTmZham5qTmFmdmF4djBPbVBHVWxWc0pDcHNmZ1E9PQ==

you can poke and prod a llm into saying practically whatever you want it to say if you word a question right you can even get it to answer questions that developers have instructed it not to answer like giving medical legal and financial advice and users can construe even vague answers into an answer about very specific instructions i think that chatgpt is good to consult to help you establish a framework for project planning but i wouldnt trust its advice beyond that but the advice you get from chatgpt on project planning tends to be pretty generic having said that im sure there will be lots of anecdotes from people who follow advice from llms and are successful but i think it would be wrongheaded to actually give credit to the llm,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZlZGbzRPV0ZDdFlyaUFKRUFoU3RyQzBPaXhLN2pxUHR4WVZPR1RLdDZYd0dzRHhmUkg1a01tRElFR3NQc29XczJKdWtlM1p5SG9MOTZpZnZOc0dXYVE9PQ==

so i am incredibly late to this but i found this a google search while thinking about the idea myself current ai just cant improve themselves in any meaningful way any attempt at such generally seems to result in an information decay like inbreeding defects compound and amplify you might consider that then maybe theres some balance point before this any changes tend to be negative and past it it would be capable of improvement so where might that point be well an interesting case study is that humanity in all the time weve been studying our own brain we havent really gotten very far weve managed to identify areas that do certain things certain basic principals on how it functions at a low level but if i were to compare it to reverse engineering a car weve barely figured out that its reacting oxygen with gasoline to make heat we have absolutely no idea how any of anything is optimised towards that task even if you translated my entire brain into easily readable program code i dont think i would have a hope in hell of ever improving it so clearly that balance point is probably already well into the realm of super human intelligence but then you realise that the smarter a thinking system is the more complex its codeconfiguration likely is and at some point this starts to resemble information theory and it might just be that its impossible for anything human ai or otherwise to understand the system that gives rise to it well enough to improve it because it has to be more complex than any information it can actually internally understand while were able to make a lot of self learning systems they have to either build their understanding by harvesting input from something smarter us normally or are configured to know what to optimise around from the start ill admit its a really downer concept but i think its definitely worth considering if there might be a more fundamental limitation in how well a system can understand itself,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjd1dBckVGaUlQT1pNWGxVbXBTSkpjMHk0SWFiaDNmTTdEblAyY3NnNy1EMEJPdzZzSjR5TjdzWUxidkdLNjRmZHZ3M0t2eDRzOUJzUTQwclpCQ2F4b3ZpM3NpSlQ4VDRvODJVSkszMzY2blE9

yes but its a bit more advance than just a random llm what im thinking is basically a local computer that runs the llm and through software on your desktop it takes screenshots once in a while and maybe record info that seems important this basically giving you the recall feature microsoft was talking about but on any computer that supports the software maybe even any phone so like the minecraft example could be done or the same with any game in its database or it can research and then depending on image recognition which would be needed anyways for this function you could add extra features like controlling a rc car with a web cam for example they why is hard to figure out unless you use it for security but the point is you could have a good amount of functionality assuming people can figure out what to do with it,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbDUxWWw5VjZmQTZxeGp2eFdnamRhTmg1M3lrUUNvcFhaYl9TRWpwSTNxaTl3TjhUTTBUd2tMWDVQUUdFRmJORnZydUptdEs3QnJYTC1UY3o1aTVhS2c9PQ==
thats part of why i think we will have a local ai core soon enough or at least there might be a push for that one of the problems with that rabbit project is it was sending data to a company server i imagine the first gen likely will be people like us running the llm and other bits on an old computer and from there we will see this spread out now when it hits consumer grade stuff i am sure both of us know the googles of the world isnt going to let that data just sit there i mean maybe since microsoft was pushing for this new ai system and flat out said the data will be local and they wont be able to see any of it but then there is a trust factor and any fine or anything is just doing business so idk but the reason why i think ai cores will be the next thing is likely most of us dont have the money or want to completely retool and then your average person wont retool look at how many people are running <number> or <number> year old computers or ones that cost <cur><number> you likely wont get a npu on something cheap for a long long while and then there is other advantages to a local ai core the biggest is while google and microsoft is forcing you to use their personalities censor limits etc other companies would likely allow you to use any voice you want any personality you want etc,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjVTQyRjNDRG1WQmRsXzBnNndscVVUcllkTjBOQzRZdmljaUhkRVZweG1jNTFsbU5fQmFrT2JLUndrTDlWRDVCUlIxM05ZYnZzZXRrZUhFQlVGZmEwS3c9PQ==

unless you use colab or similar to create a model youre going to need nvidia amd so far hasnt really gotten into the ai race almost no site allows voice cloning for free but there are a few their quality naturally will be lower than services or ability to locally use a powerful gpu where you control the amount of epochs it goes through and ensure that its not over or under trained colab uses their own gpus so yours doesnt really matter though it takes time depending on the amount of data you use to make a voice different colabs are also geared to different amounts that you can actually work with depending on how the coder wrote them max i found was <number> hour of data that is separated into <number> second or less clean blocks via another program and then uploaded to the drive each epoch on one of my models takes <number> minutes because the amount of data it works with is high i get if im lucky <number> hours of t usage my heaviest data model gets through <number> epochs each time i run it others have gotten through <number> to <number> with less than an hour of data colab has also gotten worse overtime with how long it can run before it cuts you off for the day colab is also massively unstable even for paying users running ai server stuff is expensive as all get out and it means everything has some instability to one degree or another right now if you want high quality then thats a lot of trial and error and especially most dependent on the quality of your sound files which you use to clone and how many epochs you run it weightsgg<url> does allow for free training but your model is open to the public and only paying users can private the model i also dont know what they actually use to train but youll have no control over how long its trained there are likely a dozen like it out there with different variances on what they allow and how much you can do on free tier generally voice cloning given the intensity of usage to do it to servers or hosted gpu is not free ive made many models in rvc using google colab as i also dont have a nvidia gpu but i think ill be getting one since this became my possibly most expensive hobby and i much prefer to run things locally to have more control over the process and therefore outcome basically youre asking a lot for free considering how expensive ai anything is to work with for user or company little tidbit of info as i understand it as to why nvidia is reigning champ here its not the personal user base were a drop in the bucket if we give in and buy their graphics cards its corporations almost everything ai google apple openai etc use gforce structure for their ai usage and servers this will probably eventually crash the minute any other company can produce the same quality and usability that nvidia has in the market right now which would encourage nvidia to want to strike better deals but since they have no competition they charge the moon on everyones front but so far no one has done it so the company has shot up massively in stock market value and is the primary near monopoly on anything ai related ai will get cheaper overtime once there is actually competition between the same offerings right now thats not the case pretty much all startups that pop up online and offer free usage of voice conversion extraction model creation etc are doing so to get a foot hold then they paywall it to actually make money because theyre usually in the red when they start up problem is its a race meaning there are thousands of these things in any space from image creation voice or as is newly going to become a thing video users will just move on to the next company trying to make it because they have to offer things for free in order to be used at all when they are beginning then users call them greedy because companies dont seem to understand that when you let something be free and then paywall it we all think it to be a rip off or greed even if its required to actually stay around last but not least im not an expert i understand only a little about ai in my ventures to make personal voice models for fun and learned things along the way about ai in general and the market so please anyone who works in the field learns it as a hobby or otherwise feel free to correct me,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjX0RUWWE5c3ZFSnhKMlVHMlVQRzkxOFg1NVpxTTAyc0Rfc2tKTDdqYzVFeXVsMmFDa0FJT1VlTzA1aWF6OXBBRC1QZE9RbVFCSmJfRFJUbFJTLXhyNzMtc1Mtbmgyenc4YnJNY09XMTBRTzg9

answering as a former hobbyist music producer what i imagine in the future is ai will work like a camera havent tried it myself this laptop cant handle it but theres stablediffusionwebui program that allows you to control a lot of parameters to generate ai picture something like that for music genai is huge i imagine industry leaders will integrate it into their daw workflow ableton and imageline surely have the budget i hope that later audio programmers pick up the pace and implement more aipowered vst ive seen one that automatically does mastering and it sounds super clean my main issue when i was active was it was really hard to find a good sample especially one freely available crafting one from scratch on serum vital or whatever plugin is hot nowadays takes time and the first few hundreds sample you made would be disappointing if i could just drag a sample i heard elsewhere that i like into a vst and then it automatically adjusts all the knobs to precisely reproduce it or a prompt to generate <number> different samples in one go that would save so much time with all that said if you spend a few minutes making prompts in suno or udio with lyrics coming from chatgpt or maybe gemini then call yourself a composer people will just going to laugh at your face if youre over <number>,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbUFwREhOVFR4UjZnaTVZNU1vRFpXMmlxU05hU204UnJzbzRMcGpGUzFZM01id1I2eHc0bEZaemRYRXFMQVdacmxqY3JOV2RCbzRqUmZlSWxKV3R2emc9PQ==

iyh gpto assisted mining of the paper w bespoke paper analysis prompts tldr this paper introduces abacus embeddings a new type of positional embedding that helps transformers perform complex arithmetic tasks like addition and multiplication achieving stateoftheart results in length generalization summary this paper tackles the challenge of teaching transformers to perform complex arithmetic tasks like addition and multiplication the authors identify the root cause of transformers struggle as their inability to accurately represent the position of each digit within a number especially for large numbers they propose a novel technique called abacus embeddings to address this issue abacus embeddings a simple but effective solution imagine a traditional abacus where each bead represents a digit and its position on the abacus determines its value abacus embeddings work similarly they assign a learned embedding to each digit based on its position within the number this helps the transformer understand the significance of each digit regardless of the numbers length beyond addition success in multiplication and sorting the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of abacus embeddings by achieving impressive results on addition problems with operands up to <number> digits this represents a significant leap in length generalization compared to previous methods the authors further show that abacus embeddings combined with recurrent transformer architectures can also tackle more complex tasks like multiplication and sorting achieving promising results approach the authors employ a combination of techniques to improve arithmetic performance abacus embeddings these embeddings provide explicit positional information to the transformer enabling it to understand the significance of each digit input injection this technique adds the embedded input to each decoder layer providing a direct connection between the input and the models internal representations looped transformers these architectures utilize recurrent layers allowing the same parameters to be reused multiple times enabling the model to learn and apply iterative reasoning processes evaluation and practicality the paper presents compelling results showcasing significant improvements in length generalization for addition multiplication and sorting tasks this suggests that abacus embeddings and the proposed architectural modifications can enhance the reasoning capabilities of transformers deployment and usable practicality while the paper demonstrates promising results the practicality of these methods for realworld deployment requires further exploration the computational cost of training and inference for largescale arithmetic tasks remains a significant challenge additionally the robustness of these methods to different data distributions and problem types needs to be thoroughly investigated caveats and limitations strong assumptions the paper relies on specific data formats and training setups which may not generalize to other scenarios limited scope the study focuses on specific algorithmic tasks and its applicability to other reasoning problems remains unclear computational cost the training and inference costs for largescale arithmetic tasks can be substantial surprising findings abacus embeddings effectiveness the simplicity and effectiveness of abacus embeddings were surprising demonstrating their potential to significantly improve arithmetic reasoning in transformers length generalization the ability of transformers to generalize to significantly longer problems than those seen during training is a promising development opening new horizons for algorithmic reasoning promises and new horizons this work holds promise for advancing the reasoning capabilities of transformers enabling them to tackle more complex and challenging tasks the success of abacus embeddings and the proposed architectural modifications suggests new avenues for research in algorithmic reasoning and length generalization can one retrofit existing models its unlikely you can directly retrofit existing models with abacus embeddings to gain the same level of arithmetic prowess heres why architecture dependence abacus embeddings are designed to work in conjunction with specific architectural modifications like input injection and recurrent layers these modifications are not present in most pretrained models making it difficult to simply plug in the embeddings training requirements even if you could modify the architecture abacus embeddings require extensive training on a dataset specifically designed for arithmetic tasks this training process is computationally expensive and tailored to the specific requirements of arithmetic data format the paper emphasizes that the success of abacus embeddings relies on a specific data format where numbers are presented least significant digit first pretrained models likely dont handle data in this format requiring further adjustments however there are some potential workarounds finetuning you could try finetuning a pretrained model on a dataset of arithmetic problems incorporating abacus embeddings and the necessary architectural modifications this might achieve some improvement but its unlikely to reach the same level of performance as a model trained from scratch with abacus embeddings transfer learning you could use a model trained with abacus embeddings as a starting point for transfer learning on other tasks that involve numerical data this might leverage the models acquired arithmetic abilities but it would still require adaptation and finetuning for the new task in summary while directly retrofitting existing models with abacus embeddings is challenging its possible to explore alternative approaches like finetuning or transfer learning to leverage the benefits of these embeddings for specific tasks however achieving the same level of performance as models trained from scratch with abacus embeddings is likely to be difficult,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSHhkU2t1VXpONkJOMUxkX1JPTThzWFdQT0k3NjdzN1Y2QXlUb3pRQUJoRWsySzNBNjEzRzIwVExEY1BYU2FIeW5IdHQwSFFuUEdFSk9ybEhVNEZsOUE9PQ==

yeah i think the difference is though between ai image generators is ai image generators actually affect even the small artist who may have been getting paid for commissions i think with music generators it will empower smaller artists to produce things they always wanted to i spent a lot money getting orchestral sample libraries like the spitfire abbey road one but as a musician who is used to playing real instruments i just could never get what i wanted out of midi controllers and software instruments or samples i would either have to play real instruments to get close to the sound i wanted or try to use real instruments in creative ways like playing them backwards for string sounds it sounded cool but now i feel like i have a real orchestra in my pocket ready to take instructions i dont know in a way i hated the software instrument revolution but i like what ai is giving me as a tool i dont know if im alone in this but i think most the musicians that are going to hate on ai music generators are going to be the ones who never invested a few hours in learning how to use them effectively i spent my whole life learning instruments and production and in some ways it might make the production skills more obsolete but also improve what i can do with those skills as well as far as playing instruments the value in that will always be there because the gratification it gives and if you can play multiple instruments well you can literally go anywhere and make friends and find people to jam with that is a priceless thing that ai will never replace a lot of visual art is a solo process i feel like production can be too i think people who solely produce will have more hate than actual musicians who can physically play instruments in a way it feels like an instrument for the mind and doesnt threaten at least for me everything i love about music which is creating it whether alone or with people i always hated the idea of songs as commodities to be marketed and sold it was cool when you could physically make a cd and sell it at shows its cool that artists are selling vinyls but most arent making anything of streams,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbDJQMHI5OVNJQVpCcVNsLUV3aU1JLWx3NE96aUhMSEp0d3NPSDA0MjVneGhLLXlXUWx6clBfTkNONnhQZmc3TW84b01XUGVROXZWYm85SHRzMnpObXc9PQ==

im looking forward to where this is built into daws and i can play an instrument then turn it into a different instrument a lot of times the midi controls of a piano dont suit my needs and i would record a real instrument and have melodyne turn the audio into midi then try to find software instruments that would fit what i wanted but it was never great midi is a pain to work with without a grid too one thing i hate about so much modern music is it doesnt breath i would record live to get that old timey organic vibe though that isnt always possible and it is a pain to set up a bunch of mics if you have a band to play everything live then you are working with bleed idk the potential for what i will be able to do with ai is more exciting than terrifying if you listen to the album i made with ai it breathes it feels natural to be able to create orchestral music that way is amazing the future will only give artists more control over their ideas some will hate but i really think those will be the people who dont take the time to learn new skills,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbVFlNHZZNl9hbGpIMV9ra1gtYm9wdlR0eVZOQXdzdmdyS0luNDY1X2Q1S25BNGw1MTk4TzJHVnZnMzlwNFdWUkI0a0hqZjRxVndqekh4R0JURnpIa2c9PQ==

can you have a very precise song idea you composed in your head and then recreate it with ai i dont think thats possible for now an actual composer wouldnt be able to do his work with ai only i tried suno and its not like you have a lot of control over whats being composed the exact same prompt can give extremely different results and from what i understand the people who manage to make good music with it rely a lot on luck and randomness and a lot of failed attemps with the same prompts so my answer for now would be no youre not a composer with ai music because you have very little control and cant really change details to fit your vision,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNmR4UWhVWklLalJDRGoweHdILXQ4TnhWRUpTUHNXZzBsZmUySmJuQVNkZU85UGJndUFhRkdmeHhod2RqZDNib2RVSjVOY2pDSVNrNXdtREJkR2Q1WUE9PQ==

what the big tech companies are soon going to realize is that they need to train their ai with real factual data taking extra care to make sure it is but then additionally creating orderly logical categorized databases containing that groundtruth data about virtually everything in existence which the ai is trained to reference for every answer to verify its initial thinking in a langchainlike process this might take a few internal iterations before you see the final output answer on your screen then the ai wont actually be generating answers by recalling all the information it spits out automatically from its own trained nn the equivalent of a human being reciting what it already knows by memory but rather the ai will be used as a kind of on the spot librarianresearcherreporter type of intelligence who will use its innate reasoning and hunches to give it a rational foundation then build an actual answer directly from those groundtruth databases the equivalent of an expertlevel human using hard references for all of its cited facts in a research paper which will be customized just for you on the fly or for coding after building plausible code like it does now the ai will be additionally checking its code in an internal ide tool to check for errors bad libraries corrections debugging refactoring etc then presenting the code to you at a much cleaner level of iteration beyond just the initial nn inference which can be super rough the problem right now we are seeing is that if they just try to stuff an nn with all the worlds knowledge the best we can get is a kind of dreamlike reciting of all that internally contained information leading to all the hallucinations lies and bad info its similar to if you got a smart human being to somehow read all the books in the library then leave the library and have a conversation with them standing outside without any access to the books they just read they would know a lot but stuff would come out a bit fuzzy or even drastically misremembered depending on what you asked them afterward if one company follows the groundtruth referenced databases approach then the factuality and accuracy of the output will jump to new levels setting a new benchmark which the other companies will then have to follow this is my prediction for the future of where aillm tech may be going basically using the ai nn itself as a kind of thinking engine to lay out the basic structure of the answer but then vetting and correcting it with real verified data in an internally iterative process to then process the final answer you actually see,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsemZUM1hzcWMwaVZlMTVaZUVZTS1uQXRRSi1JSW1ZTnEteTBrVGxIRjlDbEN6Wll1U2ZXdU9rNUZKUFJVZlBzSmN4RFFONWg0MTFUbFF2aVhxVmZJRnZGVUxPVVQxbm5RVEZ6NnlodFZpUmM9

as of now ai generated content can still be easily differentiated even photorralistic ai generated images still have this uncanny valley feeling and texts are either too formal and perfect or simplistic and average it makes them feel unnatural perhaps aligning helps to expose the source of text the most because practically all llms even the best opensource selfhosted ones like llama are limiting output regarding social gender or racial topics not sure if our ability to detect ai content is caused by the fact that our natural neural networks are still superior and can detect errorless ai style extremaly extended vocabulary or structural organization or perhaps it is the opposite the ai emulated text is so statistically perfect even when mimicking slang and distribution of grammatical errors that it lacks the randomness and individual style of human generated text there is also a human factor like disprepancy between prompt context input size versus increasing possible llms prompt size and limited by mind prompters forget about details like decreasing the vocabulary and complexity of sentences when downgrading language proficiency and vice versa but all of these may be temporary issue and just a technical factors easily solved in the future with brute force method and larger data sample which is why openai and google have recently signed deal with reddit,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsQmx4RktvXzZRTUphWUhUTlJaLXlaTlVqS1FoUjk0TFdHejJUVGRWZVpKMk94eG95UUVYYS1rWm5lbmRyZVZtUXpIeDVnTGpJdmk5b2YxTnY2S3gzcUE9PQ==

fascinating paper and field of study on many levels thanks for sharing im not sure if the headline is fully correct since humans still outperform llms at th and th order tasks but heres this table<url> for a breakdown of results if anyones interested gpt outperforming us at th order tasks is a very interesting result perhaps somewhat expected due to the more mathematicalcalculative aspects of them a th order intentionality question is something like does person a think that person b believes that person c thinks that person d knows that person e suspects that person f is unaware of the surprise party at the face of it id already intuit that an ai will outperform a human at this i really like the authors speculation on why its happening and their critical questioning on whether it would equate to similar real life performance where humans can operate more multimodally > it is possible that the recursive syntax of th order statements creates a cognitive load for humans that does not affect gpt<number> our results also support oesch and dunbar <number>s hypothesis that tom ability supports human mastery of recursive syntax up to order <number> but is supported by it after order <number> such that individual differences in linguistic ability may account for the decline we observe at order <number> it may be the case however that humans scoring poorly on higherorder tom tasks using linguistic stimuli would be able to make the inferences from nonlinguistic stimuli eg in real social interactions an earlier <number> paper<url> tests human performance on th order tasks coming at it from a neuroscientific perspective it suggests a possible relationship between task performance and prefrontal volume brainpower basically it observes only rare individuals performing well at th order like with many tasks gpt represents that rare indidivual while also being a generalist polymath like no other another earlier section of this paper speaks to the role of eitheror rlhf in producting tom or it occuring in a kind of linguistic emergence<url> the analogy they make between rlhf and human socialisation<url> is interesting as a nontechnical person taught in anthropology and sociology rather than machine learning that analogy seems really apt to me > van duijn et al <number> similarly found that none of the base llms they tested achieved childlevel performance whereas llms finetuned for instructions did they suggest that there could be a parallel between instructiontuning in llms and the processes by which humans receive ongoing rewards for cooperative behaviours and implicit or explicit punishment eg social exclusion for uncooperative behaviours producing an ability to take an interaction partners perspective tom as a byproduct we additionally suggest that the superior mastery of language that gpt<number> and flanpalm exhibit may in itself support a bootstrapping of tom language is replete with linguistic referents to internal states cognitive language mithen <number> and conversation provides evidence of minds in action > since the things people say in conversation implicitly convey their thoughts intentions and feelings schick et al <number> piantodosi <number> highlights that while llms likely have some degree of understanding through language alone this would be augmented by multimodality which may in turn explain why gpt<number> as the only multimodal model we tested shows such strong performance multimodality in particular might have helped gpt<number> to leverage the visual behavioural signals eg a raised eyebrow included in our stories lastly i find it interesting that academics have to hide certain data from llms now the benchmark theyre using is is available upon request but we do not include it in this paper to prevent its inclusion in pretraining corpora for future llms which could render the test redundant,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsR2hWYWhBZXVzU2hRYUZXRzM3UVJNcS1NeFhGcnZPMTFJWlowNlB3MzRSUXFETnNWZmF2OTg4U05UWG9UdnBjejhpRUVFNlZmWXNfY25DM1hDZjVGZlE9PQ==

i understand the basis of where youre coming from regarding the actual usable capabilities of these models i agree that model evaluations just like iq tests and tests in school are silly but were not smart enough to figure out any better way of generating comparisons of intellect where i disagree is the scale of their internal capabilities being dismissed as trivial and overly simplified the attention based transformer architecture is a gigantic leap in terms of generalized machine intelligence and there is a difference between learned knowledge and the ability to intelligently use that knowledge the hours used to train foundational models is simply setting the bounds and structure of its latent space but consider the dimensionality of that latent space location of embeddings are assigned into a <number> bit floating point location for each dimension of a token and a model like gpt<number> has i believe <number> dimensions per embedded token with each dimension containing context semantics and other nonlinear information about that particular token we can tell through quantizing these models that such a large information space is several orders of magnitude larger than what we need for properly comprehending just about the entire knowledge set of humanity for the past several thousands of years these transformer llms are architected to learn and understand knowledge not specifically for efficient and practical use of that knowledge the amazing part is that just from assigning numerous short strings of words into highdimensional latent space we achieve an emergent property of understanding and communication of information that is outside the training data and even the hint of the capability to generate a theory of mind is astonishing biological brains for the most part are architected far more efficiently for practical use of knowledge and the pretraining aspect is simply baselined at the ability to have drives to remain alive and immediately seek food energy which are functions of the autonomous nervous system it takes years of development for a human to gain the capabilities of rudimentary verbal communication and years longer to achieve the ability for nuanced communication were talking about the brain of a dominant species that is fundamentally built to communicate and socialize yet we cant understand the communication nuances or semantics of any other complex species or even many of the cultural differences in communication within our own species were just breaking ground in the development of machine intelligence and there are still many advances and architectural changes to come and dismissing these developments overlooks the amazing progress weve made so quickly and the potential that lies ahead,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsRXVzcGFIdW45RUd3MDk3R2JmNGdORWlJRUkyMUhIeG9wOFIyRzRJazE0UzdKaDNBSV96U0lyamp3UEdPTjJtVkd3Rk5kbWNub1pVV1dGYkFaYnZNanc9PQ==

yep i never imagined true agi controversial term but you get the point would be so close a few years ago before all the chatgpt shenanigans i wouldve thought a minimum of a few decades before we have something creatively competent possibly not even in my lifetime ai replacing humans completely would be a reality and i did not think ai would start being good at creative things i always assumed it would be good at repetitive more mindless and mechanical activities i was wrong so very wrong the opposite happened and it happened much faster looking at how competent ai became lately and how it keeps getting better and technology gets better as well and there is so much money and competition in this field and how breakthroughs could happen that massively accelerate the process i think its very reasonable to say anything can happen in the next <number><number> years im not religious or arrogant to think humans are the beallendall of intelligence so i definitely think ai can keep improving past our own abilities seeing so many people very confidently still say we need like another century to have agi or many more decades before we should start worrying is absolutely baffling competent adaptiveselflearning ai is very likely going to happen in our lifetimes even if ai would never be able to learn on the fly or things like that it is still intelligence and intelligence has power to change and revolutionize the world for good or worse,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtNGhXYW9fOXE0RG5obzRqQUFlcTFlQzhsSHp0SVAwM1ppWVRCMXhpYWl4aVM3dXJ2VGN1RVZqektFV3hyNVg0M05WNmdna3dCeW5tTmhFV0hQLU12MVZKYndHZ21HTmNxUXBna21ZSHc4Y2c9
yes but it will take time there are people that think once general superintelligence is achieved scientific advancement is going to happen ridiculously fast however even with ai simulating reality internally to speed up research its still going to take a lot of time before its in the beyond comprehension territory ai can definitely outperform us but it has to do many reallife experiments by itself in order to understand new groundbreaking concepts that we just cant be able to grasp and that is going to take time even with agi being a reality,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtNlJBdTB2VktfVU1QNk9udEJVS3dYREVZcEozWXExSkJFa2ZxVzl0V1hzWFl1UWw2MTZFUWw2WWNaT2xJVFZwb3ZzTG9oOXQySVBlZTJSY18xcXdMR2hobGJqa2hFWW1BUEdpLWxUTDFXSHc9

the continued essay thank you for sharing it talks about whether humanity will be able to achieve a sense of fulfillment without work specifically knowledge work there to help us feel a sense of accomplishment i think the answer to that is likely yes if we are strong enough as a collective to be thoughtful about it one potential pathway i have been rolling around in my head is that perhaps we could build mutually beneficial relationships with ai people and the land in such a way that helps people reconnect in a meaningful multigenerational way with the land and helps ai build a meaningful indepth connection with our world and our people through a return to small to medium sized family farms families and ai could collaborate to help determine the distinct needs of their specific smallish piece land the families could take on a sort of stewardship for the health and wellbeing of that specific piece of land and work with ai to determine the best way to grow crops and raise build optimal environments for animals without damaging our topsoil waterways biological systems etc perhaps over time by partnering with ai to help build detailed place specific knowledge of the lands needs we could live in a world where we have a healthier more mutually beneficial relationship with our land than we have ever had the chance at before this is just one of many ways we could perhaps partner with ai to make our almost certain future freedom from traditional knowledge work fulfilling and healthy rather than oppressive and demoralizing these sorts of things would require us use a more multifaceted wellness metric set that increases our wellbeing focus as opposed to our current singular focus on market driven core values but with the opportunity to partner with ai we might have our first real chance of doing that right,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtUTRpLWlRT0staEJrbk81T0lHR3VRMVBLa3QwS25jVndPX0lhU053Sk5mYUUzUlRKUV92NTdCdmdIVkVfd2lZaExiRFhvdFVKWnB0VUhwRngyNmJ3Mmc9PQ==

what evidence do we have that complex probability distributions do not give rise to the ghost evidence goes the other way as far as i understand it i dont think we can really have a legit discussion about it without understanding our presuppositions though what is consciousness where does it come from is intelligence a prerequisite of consciousness are other nonprimate mammals conscious are bugs conscious etc for me personally its just a kind of memetic field that arises as a property of complexity and for some reason appears to reach a nova point in humans i wouldnt be at all surprised to learn that consciousness exists on larger scales as well such as the planet or universe itself or forests its just quite difficult to observe unless youre a mammalian creature who can indicate readily but even then theres no proof that every human is conscious in the same way because consciousness isnt a requirement for anything we do my point being that its such a hilariously complex and borderline unknowable topic that pretending we know exactly how it would or wouldnt apply to artificial systems is pretty absurd so to me anyone saying that theres absolutely no way that llms possess anything approaching consciousness is not much different than claiming that theres no life in the universe or that fish cant feel pain,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtNmZfclUzcDRJUUpzQmxGNUZ2QWF2WUlJdVpEaXVVcHp0bldLcFFoeDNlWGluaDE0SVdGUzU2ZzNhQ2RwTnV1SXZ2OGZxd1F6NVUxWjBpOHJUZHZaLU5ZM0xmVGJSNnllQ01qSlFjMkJYQ1E9

data im aware of points in the opposite direction especially when you factor in the social and logistical friction of means tests which by definition fall on those who can least afford it here is perplexitys response to the best prompt im currently able to craft on the topic weighing both perspectives arguments that a lack of meanstesting is a key component of ubi meanstesting is expensive to administer and often fails to reach people who really need support due to stigma lack of awareness mistakes or difficulty navigating the system a ubi avoids this by providing payments to everyone unconditionally meanstesting can create disincentives to work as benefits are withdrawn as income rises a ubi maintains the incentive to work by letting recipients keep their additional earned income on top of the basic payment providing a ubi to everyone equally regardless of income or assets reduces social stigma associated with receiving benefits it frames the payment as a universal right rather than a handout for the undeserving poor meanstesting requires ongoing monitoring of recipients financial circumstances which can be intrusive a ubi respects individual privacy and autonomy by providing support without conditions arguments in favor of meanstesting ubi programs providing cash payments to wealthy individuals who dont need them is an inefficient use of limited resources meanstesting directs aid to those with the greatest need the massive cost of a truly universal basic income would require substantial tax increases which may lack political support meanstesting makes a basic income program more affordable unconditional payments to workingage adults who arent employed may be politically and socially unpalatable there is greater acceptance of aid that is tied to work or other conditions meanstested welfare programs have expanded substantially in recent decades while universal programs like social security and unemployment insurance have faced cuts suggesting meanstesting may be more politically viable in weighing these arguments a ubi without meanstesting seems to have important advantages in terms of reducing poverty empowering recipients and minimizing stigma and invasive bureaucracy however the fiscal cost and political challenges of a true ubi cannot be ignored the most promising path may be a hybrid approach with a universal payment that is sufficient to meet basic needs but not so large as to remove work incentives combined with some form of progressive taxation to claw back payments from highincome individuals this could capture many of the benefits of universality while making the program more targeted and affordable striking the right balance in the size of the payment and the tax treatment of different income groups would be crucial ultimately while a strong case can be made that universality is integral to the aims and benefits of a ubi meanstesting may need to play some role for such a program to be economically and politically feasible the ideal system would preserve the core principle of a guaranteed minimum income for all while still directing a larger net benefit to those with the greatest need careful policy design experimentation and public dialogue will be required to find the optimal approach that conclusion may suffer from confirmation bias as it matches closely with my preexisting opinion im interested in further discussion supporting links available upon request,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtNl92WTBSc2hwc1pUTGJTMW85N1BxVG51TklVbHNtSS1VTTRXSmdDSk1aU240LVNJa0lBSkJ3Umx2dG5GWk40VkZ0cmJDUXlTaGh0UWNkN1VaVDJVOWkxV1J3STZvQTRjb1VCRE1MUTdxNW89

this is hands down one of if not the expert and hugely successful good luck with that rationalization how it could happen has been explained countless times the people who say it has not been explained rather than criticizing specific ideas are clearly choosing to be ignorant and run by their emotions we already have ais that are far more competent than humans at various domains so in that regard its already a fact if you wonder how you get more general systems the current belief is that transformers with llms will suffice of course it may take time and there are widely varying estimates the root of this are things like the churchturing thesis more theoretically the scaling hypothesis more practically and the developments for general systems with both zeroshot and general gamers experimentally,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtMTBHV3FCc3RiMGM2dmdQVDF6ZHBtVGV5Tm1URzVFMU1LeFI2d1hBQVQ5X3Y3QzhvUUd6WXE4VGJ4Q2MwMXM3X1BkaUpiejdIVFBZYTgtN3B0Nko5VHc9PQ==
technology at the current level is already hugely impactful for society and productivity and that will be enough to fuel its continued development a machine passing the bar exam is already mighty impressive if you consider the applications not like lawyers are even average people so what are you even trying to defend there gpt is a huge leap to previous models and even current small models are leaps and bounds better than much larger models <number> years ago let alone one rl is a huge game changer that can be added on top of this no overhype here it is real,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtMXpyc1N2RWstanMxZjVTUmx5SE1fYUNhcDJzZUptdUdvYjAtemFwWXlDUVJDamhzMFhyVk5pNlBmc1JYbmQyaG9nZ2RRMlJJQWNlWWN5b2dlSnFaN1E9PQ==

as a data scientist my thought is if it can be given goals to achieve and set off to do that independently it can recharge and fix its body and mind etc then at some point we will just get stepped on like ants on the way to its goals an ai that can upgrade its own capabilities will eventually just eat up resources and be much larger than us there are some ai now that are constitutional like claude and wont cross ethical boundaries but if it can self upgrade then id imagine itd remove those boundaries i dont think it would like take over our organizations unless it needs that to achieve the goals i dont know why itd need to control governments and businesses to achieve its goals i imagine it would just directly take the resources cause these orgs are only useful for us to not fight over resources id imagine to take over governments theyd just blackmail everybody in power since they have your data extortion for an ai gives it arms but youd think itd want physical bodies like figure ai first the idea that an ai kills us cause it intends to and not because we are in the way of a goal doesnt really make sense to me,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM3FxMkh0cG05Q3RJSHMyRmppdGJVSGY2OXc1anpiNTJXLXhqUk01U00wXzBWYjZwTmFmblFQRXpqZUxKbDNHa2t5ck1qZ05KQWZ4cGZDVWk1RTdsNEJSMlRmT05EREY0MG4tLWIxUWNiR3M9

one of the reasons they need huge piles of data is because some of it is wrong and you need proper representation of whats real if you want this scale of performance youll need loads of data that indicate <number>+<number>=<number> to outweighby a significant marginexisting data that contradicts that without some sort of clever preprompting and retrieval mechanism these models dont do the sum like a calculator app would they operate in a linguistic space only a model with this inconsistency in the dataset would likely perform poorly on many if not all math tasks because youve destroyed the meaning of + math itself is a language not dissimilar from programming languages what we do when we compute a function or do math is to basically compile and run that logic with paper and pencil or longterm reasoning or python or just because its familiar enough that we know the answer lms do the same but without the faculties for longterm hierarchical reasoning so asking an lm to do math is like asking it to compile and run a program inside its neurons which is like asking a programmer to look at a piece of code and predict its outputs can be reasonably done if the problem is simple enough but i dont think its something id expect generally lms arent capable of fullfledged critical analysis but the key technology in themand the t in gptis the transformer architecture for every word lets say in the sequence it measure how relevant any past word is to the context to decide what the next word should be so in a sense it is reasoning about the relationships between all previous words so even if you could inject a meaningfully sized poisoned dataset it would be hampered in the way that it reasons about + and its relationship to numbers,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuQmpmZTVONzNrMlFfZnNrdm02amJHV0NpUjNodkZBUFk2VDJ1V1hYRkF3blFsSG1senZxemR3MmpKNzVHbGZZZmhVYTlwNkxqOU5LUTR3cXFjUXkxbXc9PQ==

ill let chat gpt explain how you are using a crafty argument to make a point which isnt really satisfying if you redefine what <number> <number> <number> and logical operations mean then yes good job but as ive already said we are talking about an object and another object never equating to an object another object and another object reasoning always wins there whereas an llm would blindly agree with the objects example if it were taught as such because llms dont reason lets now have some fun and let an llm explain in detail better than i can this argument makes an interesting point about the foundational nature of axioms in mathematics and their role in shaping our understanding and beliefs within the mathematical framework the assertion that if everything in our knowledge base stated <number>+<number>=<number> then humans would indeed believe that false statement effectively illustrates the dependency of mathematical truth on the acceptance of initial axioms however the argument over simplifies the relationship between axiomatic foundations and the development of mathematical theories while its true that mathematics builds on set axioms the process of choosing and accepting these axioms is not arbitrary but is guided by both historical context and practical necessity moreover mathematical theories are validated not only by internal consistency but also by their applicability and utility in describing the physical world and other abstract systems additionally the statement could benefit from acknowledging that mathematical proofs and developments also involve a significant degree of creativity intuition and discovery which go beyond mere logical deduction from axioms these elements play a crucial role in the evolution of mathematical thought and in the refinement and sometimes replacement of older axioms in conclusion while the critique effectively highlights the foundational role of axioms in mathematics it could be enriched by a more nuanced discussion of how axioms are chosen and the interplay between intuition creativity and logical deduction in the development of mathematical theories there are hypothetical conditions under which an intelligence whether artificial or otherwise could be taught that <number>+<number>=<number> and reason within that framework as if it were true this would involve defining the operations and the nature of <number> + and <number> in a nonstandard way that supports this equation here are a few scenarios where this could occur <number> redefinition of symbols or operations if the symbols <number> + <number> or the operation itself are redefined <number>+<number>=<number> could hold under the new definitions for example if <number> represents a certain quantity and + is defined in such a way that combining two units of <number> results in a quantity defined as <number> then within that specific system the equation would be correct <number> nonstandard mathematical systems in certain abstract mathematical frameworks like those involving modular arithmetic or alternative algebraic structures the traditional rules of arithmetic do not necessarily apply for instance in a modular system with a modulus of <number> the equation <number>+<number> equals <number> not <number> because all results are considered modulo <number> <number> faulty logic circuits or programming in ai if an artificial intelligence is programmed with or develops faulty logic circuits that misinterpret numerical data or arithmetic operations it could conclude that <number>+<number>=<number> this scenario is less about redefining mathematical principles and more about errors in processing or foundational logic flaws <number> teaching based on false premises an intelligence could be conditioned or programmed to accept false premises as true much like indoctrination if an ai or any learning entity is consistently taught that <number>+<number>=<number> with reinforced learning that does not allow for external verification or contradiction it might accept and operate under this premise as if it were true in any case the acceptance of <number>+<number>=<number> as true would depend heavily on the specific rules and definitions within the system in which this arithmetic is being conducted such conditions highlight the importance of foundational axioms and definitions in shaping the conclusions and operations within any logical or mathematical system,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNVdtem1yY0J6dkJ5Ul9kakQyR2NaU3ZaWV9IYm9EbVFpQ2toM2FnM0VNY0RzSTR0U1lMaW5SLXI2UXBwRGZJOHZGeGlrZFBnckNvMTB6ZmM4SkVDeDkyUmZtY2QtQWU5Rk1wN2JBRGN4SVE9

its not that doing laundry or dishes are more difficult than creating art the problem lies at the junction where the actual ai commands need to leave the digital space and interact with the physical world right now most robots are very good at completing one maybe <number> tasks think a robotic arm in an assembly line their sensory capabilities are entirely limited to the position of the motors that drive the arm itself it has no need for awareness beyond that self driving cars are a pretty big step past that they need to know not only their physical position in space in the moment they also need to know the positions of all the other objects in their vicinity and their speed and heading so they can prevent collisions still that isnt going to be enough for a robot to do more than safely move itself from its charging station to the laundry room once the robit actually gets to the laundry room it will need the ability to interact with household objects that were designed to be used by humans it will need something that is analogous to hands in order to open the dryer it will need some way to sense when it has picked up an item of clothing which to most of us humans isnt very difficuly but thats only because our hands have evolved over millenia to have sensitivity and dexterity that is basically unrivaled in the entire animal kingdom once a robot is able to pick up a single garment and manipulate it in a way that doesnt completely shred it then everything else will probably be really easy the next hurdle is going to be cost the kinds of capabilities ive mentioned should be within reach of current tech or if not now then certainly within the decade the problem is that it is prohibitively expensive and barring some kind of paradigm shifting technological advancements will likely remain the last hurdle to the average consumer household being able to have their own robo maidbutler to handle all the menial chores that are necessary for maintaining a home yet most people despise one last bit of my completely unqualified opinion on the future of airobothuman relations we will almost certainly have fully autonomous ai controlled sex robots decades before we have ai robots capable of doing tasks like laundry or house cleaning if you managed to make it this far thank you for reading,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUlFOb09ZYUt2cUxKTHAwMnRoT3d4eVVhX2ZUUUJXZlVKSWFvU1lmZkJnWnRHLVQ0eEtPT2pIVlA3R1F5Q3ZuQU5VeTFyV1NLcFRuT2JlaVNjemlKQWc9PQ==

heres two relevant quotes for yall worried about losing your creative jobs <number> cant machines build these faster he asked the woman looking around the starship shell why of course she laughed then why do you do it its fun you see one of these big mothers sail out those doors for the first time heading for deep space three hundred people on board everything working the mind quite happy and you think i helped build that the fact a machine could have done it faster doesnt alter the fact that it was you who actually did it hmm he said well you may hmm as you wish the woman said approaching a translucent hologram of the halfcompleted ship where a few other construction workers were standing pointing inside the model and talking but have you ever been gliding or swum underwater yes he agreed the woman shrugged yet birds fly better than we do and fish swim better do we stop gliding or swimming because of this he smiled i suppose not you suppose correctly the woman said and why she looked at him grinning because its fun <number> but in the end its still just cleaning a table and therefore does not really signify on the cosmic scale of events the man suggested he smiled in response to the mans grin well yes but then what does signify my other work is that really important either i could try composing wonderful musical works or daylong entertainment epics but what would that do give people pleasure my wiping this table gives me pleasure and people come to a clean table which gives them pleasure and anyway the man laughed people die stars die universes die what is any achievement however great it was once time itself is dead of course if all i did was wipe tables then of course it would seem a mean and despicable waste of my huge intellectual potential but because i choose to do it it gives me pleasure and the man said with a smile its a good way of meeting people so where are you from anyway both are from the same book use of weapons by iain m banks both take place in a postscarcity utopia the rest can be understood from the quotes,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJud3lpeVUyb2Iybnk4MERQbXg1bjBvck8wS1Fqd0JIVGhwdnpXYUw2Z2FZdm91M29ZZ3VxOEtPOWxGVlB1WnJ0MWpDbWJHdk5aaHRNdVZESTVaSU40VEE9PQ==

very lazy take in my opinion i mean of course we all want the mundane automated so we can enjoy the finer things in life like art writing music etc the fact is we are working towards it quickly and we will get there first we need more affordable robotics and the software to help fully automate the mundane like laundry but its coming faster than people realize the problem is that most people likely will not be spending their excess time on music art or really anything creative for that matter you can kinda see the theories unfold and the generation of leisure is among us most of us will sit on our asses and watch tv doom scroll sports etc,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuckFRdVlPQXNWdEMwOEEwWFFNbGVWdzlnczVpNlF0QVpJNXBMR0luZnZLZzdNUHQ5Tk5OX3V2d2FmWkNCckZldUZkT0pFR054cGM0dWlxbmpySkpWU3c9PQ==

i agree that this should be better for the consumer or everyday person but theyre not the ones making ai companies are as a company replacing a person youre employing by automating their skill set is much much better because not only does it save you money in salary but it gets you the skill set you were paying for and puts you in control of it to do what you want with it a machine should also potentially be faster and scale better than a human and the cost wouldnt increase with time or scale of the project like it would with a human employee there already are machines that wash dishes and laundry the only things left to automate are loading and unloading of the dishes and laundry and folding or putting them away coming up with a machine that can do that would be more expensive that its worth wouldnt generate as much money as what theyre using ai for now and is frankly a small amount of work to offload onto a customer buying a dishwasher or washer dryer combo,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuaE5oMlM0Nm8yRjRrYmZQbTVOZDBVRU8xeTFidE1lMkVjZFQyaElqTUlOSzZibDFTbDVfQ1NwS01CMnRTcm8zcjRSU2ZHNzE3MFQxRHYtR0E3amR2M1E9PQ==

its categorically wild to me that anyone would ever disagree with this philosophers from thousands of years ago knew that making art was good for your personal wellbeing and your sense of fulfillment all modern science has done is prove it and reinforce that notion over and over ai starting to take that away from us without solving most of our mundane problems is a travesty its solving some mundane problems but surprise theyre mostly enterprise problems that save businesses money to be clear im not saying it doesnt make sense for businesses to pump money into that im saying that its not helpful to human progress or happiness itself whats even more conceptually funny to me is that an ais capacity to understand causal and quantifiable relationships is much higher than its ability to understand nuanced and inherently subjective information given that ai should be able to relatively easily replace ceos and many executive positions that require making broad decisions based on available market data something humans will generally be worse at than machines in the long run despite that fact theres no way ceos will let that happen for generations since it affects their bottom line and they have the power of investment and business infrastructure so well have ai slowly replace humans in positions that ai is less suited for and not for positions to which theyre more suited and thats at the heart of joannas comment plus the added irony of corporate wankery,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJueXE0LW9NNkdZVXY3RkRFREIyZ2hCQUFmSkRZRkFGem1xYXZseFV6MHlzVm5sMy13d0lhcnQzUGNOS2hKUlo5d2V5cGItX3pWZWRzZUtVeDEwQ3I5dHc9PQ==

true but the democracies also tend to be rich so are they happy because they are rich or because they are democracies and are they rich because they are democracies or because they are or were militarily powerful several major european countries had large overseas empires before they became democracies and america conquered most of north america in the th century and in the th century managed to be on the winning side in two world wars without having to get their economic base bombed so i think there are lots of other factors that contribute to their sense of wellbeing that they misattribute to their political system the americans are about to elect a convicted felon to be their president and their national legislature is a millonaires club well see how they feel about their democracy in the next few years,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuWGxNWnM5ZjZjR2NRaUp3cVNPNGMzaXBFWEdaRXhsMHFCRUdkRXRmNXRzS2ppS0Nsd3diRVBpNWtIYWhHcF81eUJyTEROZUo2OUt4dUVPckJNNTgxV2EyUmhKMTlRWWVKX0laUWxOeDdzUEU9

you addressed how the post was about saving up time by having ai do chores not the replacement of work and it didnt even go against my argument because all you said is actually artist also struggle to get paid well at their job so clearly they wouldnt want anyone else to suffer from job insecurity except i seen far too many artist literally say the same line i stated before because they think that blue collar work is dangerous and should be replaced but i digress trust me i already know my job is practically on the way to being fully replaced i m sure a very small group of artists are still going to be wanted for their authenticity but idk about software programmer or your average factory workers actually maybe factory worker will never be replaced depending on how costly it is to maintain robots,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuSkJVMzh5TzdSZVZEaEljVFhpMWllYzJEb1Jrd1JfTzZJSkNyQXRDbWl1U3ZMNjUwV1NtTnVGMGFBLWRCc1VOb3daLWMyLUZiRFhJcVVCWE9FenhlVHJ0dWk5TDBJUFNVUThUNU0xWEY4ZnM9

you seem to have missed my point or maybe i wasnt clear enough my point isnt that it wont reach the visual quality of normal artists its that the art will lack the meaning and emotion that comes with art people dont consume art because someones artistic skillmerit but rather the emotional feelings aesthetic and meaning it provides ai in its current state literally just recognizes patterns at a very detailed advanced level and in doing so becomes great at mimicking art but not truly understanding how it works or what its even creating artists dont learn by just understanding the patterns they learn the emotional context behind why they might represent things in certain ways what is being portrayed in the image the purpose its connection to real experiences etc art is a medium that is heavy on expressing real life experiences emotions events etc all things that ai can try to represent but never actually understand and this isnt to say ai art wont look good more that a well trained artist will be able to portray their art with a lot more meaning behind it because theres a lot more that goes into art than just patterns,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuMTU1MXAzSW1GODVBRnNVd0RINUk4LWJxMWtVQ2drOEliNjBGd0ZhMWlrS0lMc3NZWENDZmNmVzhRSHdVdjlDTGhQLXdNZlE5M2hwSF94Z1pOUHc0ZWc9PQ==

leaving aside the what is and isnt art debate its just a terrible idea to delegate what we consider ai to art and writing the kind of ai that is popularized now cannot create it can only blindly guess and mash stuff together what you would need would be something akin to an actual artificial consciousness something that could think for itself and then create something based around its own idea this isnt a problem that will be solved over time for this kind of ai because this kind of ai and true artificial intelligence are two completely different things generative ai im sure has its uses but it fails as an artistic tool or creator it works as an image generator which is an important distinction,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuU1NaeGR4dTI3QldzTXplZ1Exa29oeUpyZVJocHlUcXY3dW9va254VHhwN1VZVmFkMlVoblFCb2hPZzN4aG9NdlFqc2VoZW9VcTk1T3BEN2xucmVKaVE9PQ==

you cant create something that can solve practical problems without at the same time replacing some humans for some humans solving practical problems is their job the ability to automate artistic creativity is an inevitable side product of automating intelligence in general you cant separate these things yes some companies are marketing the creative abilities thats capitalism for better or worse but to say that theres an emphasis on this is ignoring some of the breakthroughs in medical and materials sciences those things dont get as much media attention because the media wants clicks the emphasis is on whats being publicized vs the things going on that arent immediately visible to and usable by the general public nobody is sitting at home simulating the folding of proteins in order to create new medications we are having fun with making art videos and music that doesnt mean that theres an emphasis on those latter things theyre just more visible to the public,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuMFlYbEZWcm5tT3BFV09UemZjUlZrZGlYb1lQZlYyX0xsdkdQVU50dzRUVjdreDFYYmMydTQzRDc1V3dsR0RYc1dlQzctcks2SkNEWTJlMi1PTkhtQ0E9PQ==

people do these things because they like to do it yes but since ive started my art journey something ive come to realize that i didnt know beforehand was how intensive creating art is because of the sheer amount of problem solving that goes into it creating good art is not play its work you know how your brain feels while youre doing math problem solving is fun but it still exhausts you and your energy is a limited resource creating art feels exactly the same its extremely rewarding but it requires a ton of brain power to do it well the last thing most working artists want to do after a full day of work is do more art it is categorically a drain of your mental resources if every working artist suddenly needed to find a nonart job i dont think many of them would continue to do art because most people dont have the mental resources to keep working after a full days work especially with how almost every job is becoming more and more competitive,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUmw5TU9WNXFPaFJTeVZMODJtUlpnS2V5UlVqRmp5T3VzMnM3cmxTUEwyZGtDZjU0V1NZbVhiTlFld2FRN2lxeFJuQ1huQlZmaXM1T0xmbFFPMVdhbnc9PQ==

disagree and will explain why the us cultural dominance is less because it controlled the means of production of art and more because it controlled the means of distribution of art literally so many people from so many countries write great books for example but the reason why only english writing authors in western europe or america tend to do very well is because the publishing industry in new york or la for film decides who gets to write for a living and that is largely based on someone having connections to western artistic elites so ai making art easier to create has no effect on the means of distribution,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTVZUQkZJWmVKWnVVaVEyT3pmS0hLMDZJQnZyRzRsTVYtR1V5TjQ5Yi1QUWlrVGFsOVVnenJaeVYxUGhoNmwzWUROUElINVRwU2NWVU1oLWR6Vnl2a2c9PQ==

but attribution poses a real practical problem at the moment if you are inspired to make something but nobody could trust whether it came from an ai or a human would you still make it would it be worth less in any way than otherwise certainly thats subjective but its also certain that a significant number of artists would say that ai is diminishing drive to produce although not necessarily inspiration of ideas this is an important distinction to draw youre right that all art retains the power to emit artistic inspiration but if anyone could create the same thing with such little effort then the potential sale value of said art plummets and the opportunity cost of learning to manually create the art skyrockets and thats going to push a lot of artists current and future into other fields regardless of the level of authenticity for which they were striving in other words youre ignoring that theres another point to making art for artists and thats to get paid for the fruit of the skills theyd honed they were probably having fun too there will still be oil paintings but fewer painters and more of the paintings will be flawed and the good ones will be more expensive,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJudi1JTm1SeW5qeWdOMXQyOXBxcktNd1UxbmIxekMyOXlKbll4RVJnRTNKaFN0WTBNcXR0dFNoR1hKNkxqNGZqNmVEM3FrSFR4cnBJMU5iX1FoZ01IdWNpZU1DSEQ3NDRZZXdDVjNSRGs2WEk9

what im curious about is how many people will do art when they dont have to make a living if we were living in a star trek world of replicators where theres no money and anyone can have anything they want how many people would still be doing art i assume some would but would the numbers increase or decrease i guess it boils down to is art self expression or is art a way to make a buck maybe its both but what will happen to art when art and money no longer intersect because there isnt any money any longer we always seem to want to cast art as a form of labor but that seems a problem with our latecapitalist mindset more than anything else what happens to art when theres no more human labor when ais are doing everything and no human has to do anything will we still make it or will we just consume the echoes of our ancestors,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJucm5CN1Y0V3UzZzZGRFBocWU5bTFzU0ZmSkJjeHctVThPYVQ1UEVwNlpOYmY2R01TdElraFR6d3RIN2twanJZVjhMQ2dTMEJaX093Q2Qxeng2cTdyLWc9PQ==

ideally a deep learning algorithm to a identify clinical details by extracting key words from a radiology request form to know what form of scan has been requested b decide whether the request can be accepted or rejected c if rejected specify the reason for rejection eg because clinical details are insufficient or if it is a duplicate request sent twice or if the request does not conform to the current guidelines and d if accepted put in the ideal scan protocol for this it would save tons of time for the radiologist and give them more clinical time to report rather than spend time in the decisionmaking process of accepting or rejecting radiology requests i can see tons of hospitals queuing to invest in such a software if available but i guess it isnt as cool as interpreting chest xray or mammograms so none of the big companies care ps if the software could also prioritise and schedule the scans it would be the cherry on the cake,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZzQtSzJXQUllS1ZPSmJBcW9vU3c5OUllUy1wVWtjaF81bnMyX3pwYV9RRGp2WlNTc2F4MWdyMjFYdjNfSkVkMkpRM3JLWFlqU2xwVkFqUm1faXl6Uk92eHo0Z1EzR3AyMGJiSWMwRXFtMEk9

it would be even closer to true open source if they released the dataset along with the weights and the training code since the dataset is like the uncompiled version of the model but network weights are still better than nothing and better than compiled binaries you can hack and fine tune the model yourself say what you want but fine tuning apis are limited people could find ways to understand the model weights and that is very difficult if not impossible to do if we dont have the weights and lastly having the weights means that the model is essentially free to use forever that is still one of the major advantage of open source i am saying this because i am not sure if rob is implying the weights shouldnt be available publicly or if the releasing the weights should be called something else than opensource i dont really see the point of arguing for the latter so i wanted to emphasize why i think it is important to release the weights whatever you call this,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuT0I1aTljeVJPRU55dnBHbGlpQS1ycDVtTWxCUllKck1IYlY0UkdVT2hCbGNOeDVuVnU4MWFWaU9XdjVUdzlubVZvdUtteHVDMFcxX0d6Z2pndmNYUlE9PQ==

>comment still stands it doesnt lol you seemingly just dont understand how people choose the arts how the arts actually work particularly in our current economic model i think when you really dig you realise that wealth inequality is the biggest driver of people not succeeding in the arts if its not more evenly distributed the general public dont have as much money to spend on enriching things like exhibitions concerts etc if the governing bodies only serve the richest they wont invest in public education libraries galleries etc and kids wont be exposed to arts and therefore wont be inspired to follow in the footsteps of their inspirations ergo no more innovators generative ai for art especially music is not intended to be a tool in the long run its intended to be a direct replacement to cut costs so the labels can make more profit that complete removal of the human experience from art completely defeats the point of why we enjoy it in the first place defending it now and saying the arts industries should just accept it is all fun and games until your sector is next in line for the replacement machine and you wont be singing the same tune we should all be scared of the implications while theres no legislative roadmap for what happens next,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuVUF2eXF3LUZ5SlY1TUVjc0kwUzZRSWpnc2lWV1ItaXNyMnQxYmRSXzZ3aXhYWlM3YjVjWW9Gak9uUnBqQU9sSWFUbGZRcjRkcnMzOW9rWHo5QmxKX0E9PQ==

for now any company noticeably using ai is seen as a cheapskate unable to fund a proper marketing team by me i think that the difference between something being a competitive sport and a competitive industry is pretty different btw watching an ai beat a human isnt exactly exciting after its been proven to have a near guaranteed chance so the sport maintains its validity i think art will maintain its validity as well but i do suspect that as long as we live in this capitalist hellhole it will be a much riskier venture for funds your ai might become better but how many resources is that going to take for how much improvement it is most likely a logarithmic scale considering it is a linear algebra problem right now i see the storm of bad output and its only going to get worse as it gets more adopted,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuYU9PeVVmbF9PRExzdWUwYU5PcHg5d04tWkxGdzVEZEI1M1VZMmlWZTAxSFlaLXZzWXQ2R0RENXNtblBja0ZUSEdjTmJrbFRST2E5T1c3eWVBaGs0X3c9PQ==

meh most people with artistic talents have largely been of the craftsman type throughout history even most of the artists who dont like ai are largely doing commercial work that requires mostly technical skills not creativity its why their jobs were and are able to be automated because a community pool looking for a new logo doesnt need some avant garde design they just want the name and a run of the mill picture of the mascot ultimately truly creative artists on the cutting edge will still be out there making new art but they are such a small portion of the art world and even most of them are supplementing their income with commercial art of some kind of the other,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuSHl5VExjbWhIMGxXVXQ3N2Y2dTBtd1E5OVY2cGFFMjlvV1FTUjdxOXVsei1pbXB5WmcteXBtUUlMbU9OYjRMSjJIWHVXcTNLV1NDanpQeGl2d1F6TUE9PQ==

i hear where youre coming from though its a bit tactless so its not likely to get much traction lol ill dare to join the club for a moment though i really dont mean to offend if ai art had nothing to offer and no one was willing to choose an ai pic over a human pic there would be no controversy we thought we knew what creativity was in some sense or at least that it couldnt be imitated and i think its perfectly safe to consider that there are forms and levels of creativity that are completely human and that they may even remain so but theres a scary specter in all of this maybe some of what we call creativity is mechanical maybe part of us is mechanical and maybe we arent actually as in touch with whatever is actually uniquely human as we thought and maybe our philosophy and selfimage isnt developed enough to comfortably withstand these questions i think it goes beyond theft and lost jobs some antiais explanation for outrage or hurt feelings and envy some proais explanation for outrage what is uniquely valuable and irreproducible in the human being and are we actually in touch with it are our common definitions of creativity not rich enough are we not as creative as we thought if not can we do anything about that some find these questions exciting but many probably find them either threatening to their creative identity or irrelevant to their technological hedonism im hoping humanity grows in wisdom in the long run from all of this so i hope enough people will try to see each others perspectives that neither side will be too easily leveraged by third parties to either create unrealistic legal confines which large corpos and governments will probably get loopholes for or to take advantage of instantgratification in ways that harm the health of mankind there are dangers to lacking wisdom on both sides of any conflict,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJubjhVUGV0eEV3NkpPUVY1c3hRUXpSNHc5enZydjNTR1p5NXRLS0NJbEFkUTVHX3gyT2Z4WTJDaHhzRlhuendXUnVzV3paSktqS05VbWpkMHlZcXZZWmc9PQ==

wealth inequality or the alternative of financial parity doesnt change the fundamental basic concept of supply and demand if you can be replaced by an ai model or any other emerging technologies then you are not in demand protesting about it wont change the facts the harsh truth is that if people want to pursue these fields then they are either going to have to be good enough that their talents are still in demand or learn how to use the new technology themselves to contribute to their chosen field ive no doubt that this will limit or negatively influence the lives of those choosing to start out in these fields but thats just the pitfalls of going into a career many aspire to theres a reason <number> of actors work as serving staff and that predates ai people need to stop worrying so much about what opportunities ai is taking away and start looking at what opportunities ai will create trying to do anything different is as daft as caligula trying to fight the sea as to your subjective proposal that machine driven art is inferior to man made art that flys counter to your main argument id say you are likely right which is why i dont see good artists of any medium being pushed out edit whilst i disagree with your position i appreciate the well thought out and in depth discussion thanks,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuVk91bWhsRVEzdkxlbUZwQ2REbHZFTTRIUWhRQ29hMWZXdDZhTTVZRHR6ZEJpcVFxZG9xZXlCdjItQlVLYndnZmQxSkZ3Z2JSZC1tWTdiZzU0d01sMVE9PQ==

evolution precisely predicts that species adapt to the environment if the environment is entirely automated people will adapt to it meaning the people that survive better will get to reproduce more on average and so i really dont see why the species would disappear if anything creating a perfect environment should make the species thrive the things that make species disappear are changes that make the environment harsher to the species considered like what we are doing to other species by transforming the world to suit humans the idea that we will disappear just because we have no more difficulty to do anything is ridiculous imo there will always be people that will live in the old fashioned ways even if the rest of humanity has access to fabulous technologies if you think there are resources contradicting this precise statement you should point to them directly because i dont even know what i would be supposed to type into a search engine human extinction by too much automation,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuY1VPVm9taWZ0V0RKN1RIMkNyRVJFNWJuR2ZnSC1YQzNIOTVfOE1vbVZnTUlyWEtaZTBBT013aXhwVFpGNk14djRBNm0ybUJHVEtZeWZrRUhTbVJnZkE9PQ==

>and this poster seems to do that not to say i totally disregard what they bring to the table i just view it with a lot of skepticism if you simplify it down to throw caution to the wind and full steam ahead vs lets shut the whole thing down its easier to predict the outcome of the second camp everything will be like it is today or maybe a few years ago and we know what that world looks like we know that largely its safe and everyone survives and it allows for people to live long fulfilled lives even though there is still some struggle from time to time its harder to predict the outcome of the first camp because almost literally anything is possible from a utopian dream world youre hoping for to the dystopian terminator world that doomers are afraid of and everything in between you seem like you want to be less cautious in hope of reaching that utopian dream world other people want to pump the breaks because they see that the world we live in today isnt so bad lets not fuck it up by being reckless i dont know why you need to treat people raising concerns with skepticism i think its wise to be as cautious as possible as we proceed because if that utopia is in the cards well get there eventually because as long as humans are alive well be working towards it but if we fuck it up were dead forever and i certainly dont want that for myself or my children whats that old saying something like those with their eyes to the sky cant see where theyre going and will trip over roots those with their eyes to the ground will hit their head on branches only the pragmatic person who looks forward can avoid all obstacles,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuU296ZW1LSXZrOUJDcllvMHZIN3JoNEVVNGZfbk0xMFJNVFRiTC0wZEUyQTdhdFFZb1hhZFJYbkc1XzBLdGQzTW8ta3dIb05SOGRQWXNkNy1VTWx6dmc9PQ==

most artistic endeavors should be hobbies seems in direct opposition to artists should be able to have a career in it maybe term defining is necessary here a hobby is intrinsically something that you do in your spare time and thus not as a career either in terms of time spent on it nor primary income earner i think a difference in perspective here is youre using examples of single individuals making physical goods craftsmen really as opposed to things like game illustrators or actors or something that produces less tangible products of work and within a larger team framework these more complex skillsets are not achievable in your spare time and as such require compensation that allows you to make it your primary income ai is not able to perform at the higher levels of this and the current models of ai never will this is a longer conversation but ultimately ai is imitative not inventive and as a tool it needs an artist with a trained eye to produce new things to guide it and if we dont allow a path for artists who can be replaced by ai to have a way to train up to the highest levels an mfa in art is basically a starting point right now decades of experience go into the higher level performers in games and movies then we will simply lose the ability as a culture to produce those works once our old form individuals retire it was actually already happening without ai in game dev most major companies are struggling with the fact that investors do not want them to hire junior and mid level artists they only want the more profitable senior artists as senior artists retire die or just leave they try to find seniors to replace them and the production comes to a crawl as that department becomes a bottleneck those companies are already using ai it isnt enough to replace the seniors and if you look at the job postings the majority are for seniors the layoffs are a revelation of this they simply cant continue operating like this ai wont save them and if careers arent possible for new creatives the industry is gonna crash,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTk83ZUlaYUNodGt2NnFfeE52RGQ2Xzk0YTlTSUV2MnpnQXc2NWluU2IxZUlaRzVJVEVPR1JuNkgyN2tvNzBpZ0l4Q3c3Z1JHNXpkTlMtWTMxMTZ0NFE9PQ==

ai is a tool that can make art creation more accessible if its a thing humans love to do then why should it demand like <number> hours of practice funded by your wealthy parents if art is fundamental to the human experience then ai tools can allow for truly democratizing that experience the real concern is that these scions wont be able to hold their monopoly on art jobs if its susceptible and it has become a popular opinion because artists are influential on social media also a lot of critiques are confused they say things like gen ai isnt art if its not art then theres no challenge to art its only a threat if it can do art yes a <number> word prompt cannot replace you but thats not really the point they are showcasing improvements in technology that can be applied to assist art people do not seem well aware of advances in assisted ai tools for instance controlnet can provide a great deal of control for artists to have ai essentially fill in their ideas that they sketch out you could have ai tools that fill in animations between key frames greatly reducing the cost and effort of making an animation none of these things make it not art anymore than utilizing photoshop or even photography eliminates art,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvTzNXWnRVVF9vR3EzMXdtRDBvd3hSOUVCbUdtS09UQ1hOd0dLTkJSMGhCQVlVVjN6N2Rva1B1SHp4djFGS00wcnBxaGhuOEdXSVU2RmxNdnlpa3pUYUE9PQ==

the point is a very advanced ai with a clear goal is not going to have clear strategies towards the goal or that its values might not align with ours in achieving the goal i think this isnt a reason not to research ai but something to keep in the back of your mind the whole time how can you keep it aligned how can you make it share values how can you do this without just locking it down like how we do chatgpt because frankly that can just be bypassed we need a robust solution to this problem and we dont have one,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvRlU3T09qeHRINW1ZQXFES3BYSVMtNzF1dVJORWlTV250UVZvaFNRX0VEV1hGUlJCOGJwR0E1NmVWOHctXzNvTVJNai1hYmVWdnZ2UGJZclptZ010YlE9PQ==
i think youre assuming im saying art isnt patterns i never said that all i said is that theres more to art than just patterns yes ai can make decent looking art or sometimes stuff that looks amazing my only real point is that despite how good something looks the value of art isnt solely based on your ability to get the patterns right and make things visually appealing but ig what im trying to say is that ais are limited to just basing their art off of existing patterns from art in its data whereas humans make art based on the whole human experience emotions events inspirations experimentation etc which is why i still think theres a value to a professional experienced artist vs an ai,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvTUkxR1ZoQTNjRDRyNmxMc3pFcGVYdlhkSUtWa25obmd2YlU3MWxwMFl2MF95dHdvS0owcVRxV3Z0NFF0NkI5Q2tuZTlEa2pLbmxlMVZFcGFrSUswekE9PQ==

valid based on your definitions though this stance i think goes very quickly into a philosophical debate about the clear definition of the human experience and what true art is both can be subjective so hard to argue either way consider this line from the matrix what is real how do you define real if youre talking about what you can smell what you can taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain given that ai is our attempt to replicate the human mind in in digital form and clearly it is working which also uses electrical signals theres going to be a lot of introspection in our future because the lines are going to get really blurry consider this is an electric car any less of a car because it uses an electric motor instead of a combustion engine i recommend the ghost in the shell anime series which explores a lot of these grey areas that come with advancing ai among other technologies the altered carbon show is very similar but is more hollywood whearas ghost in the shell has more intellectual dialog both play with a concept where the technology exists to backup upload and download the human consciousness aka the ghost between real or artificial bodies the shell the events that unfold pose many questions about ai identity and consciousness that are rapidly becoming not just science fiction anymore side note i just realized that the only <number> comments i responded to on this whole post were from the same person i swear that was a coincidence lol,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvY2RzSzltTjdpQldCOXBvYkxGRV9LdnIyN0FLN1pCT1BCMDlEUkpWdEYtbENiZm9EY0U2cWs2WXJiSUN1NjdzZmh6WUNXTUlJNmtKNTE3bVZhLXlNSkE9PQ==

i completely agree with you that ai art isnt art my point is that its easier and cheaper to pay for bland lifeless art and unfortunately that means artists are going to get fucked over by companies replacing them despite it being worse and though it is a tool you can use or get left behind using it already makes those companies see you as less valuable and detract from your pay this is exactly what happened with the wga strikes line for line i think the impact will hit true paintbrush and easel artists who paint for peoples walls later but the ones doing stuff like branding art product art social media banners smalltime portraits logos whatever else that requires someone with money who is a little thriftier that stuff will no longer be the art it once was and we will all be worse off for it,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvRFZDSHdvLVctX2wtVDY0eXBYcDd2MHh2NnJIQS1Va2dqYWV4cXpjZUgtaUFvR05jOU5zMzJlb3pLejNEQXBDSHN0bUphQWMxSnhvZkx4eVN3MmY2X1E9PQ==

i dont think thats really the full reality of that analogy small towns relying on textiles or other types of manufacturing were still problems that were confined to local markets when ai is good enough to replace programmers to the point where a business user can just pop in a prompt and get useful output they can implement without the assistance of a human technical resource what other white collar job wont ai be able to replace are you really adapting by taking a job in the trades or fast food or retail just because the job hasnt been automated away yet or are you just downgrading your career horizons because you have no other options but to sideline your career and accept less because thats all thats left for you mills and factories moving away really hurt local economies but it was still a mostly self contained problem isolated to specific geographical boundaries with minimal impact beyond them ai is not going to be selfcontained or geoconstrained if its good enough to replace you at one knowledge work job it will be good enough to replace you at any knowledge work job youll adapt by taking a job that you hate that doesnt make use of any of your highly specialized and once highly valued skills because those are the only jobs still left and also the next jobs that ai products will come for after all theyre already working on interactive ai controlled robots the best possible outcome is that this forces us to reorient society away from mandatory work and towards something like a minimum basic income while robots do all of the work and we live lives of leisure the more likely scenario is that were all unemployed and just stuck being poor with no real opportunities to do anything about it because nobody values human employment anymore then again a lot of the current aienabled products promoted on the market are vaporware with a lot of smoke and mirrors with human inputs behind the scenes to connect the dots on what the tool will someday hopefully be capable of doing itself so another likely scenario is that ai will always just be a tool that makes highly skilled and knowledgeable workers more efficient but is never really good enough to realistically replace the roles of those humans altogether,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVTZrVHNLc2hGbm5oQXE0SHJhTkE2ekpibkQtODJZaHVsTXpRbEZjY3BMUjhDVkVHelFSSV9UaTA2ZDd1U2lVaHZ0bm5VeGFKSXBpQkZwVnR4VFZHSGc9PQ==

but in the world we live in these are often the same thing people who love to do art often only get to determine the portion of their time they can spend on that art by the money they make off of it my sister is a textiles artist whos career has waxed and waned when it was waxing she would get to make art all of the time because she could live off of the proceeds when it wakes she needs to work other jobs and cant afford to spend time doing art i think its quite likely there will be a period of time where a lot less human hours will be able to spent on art and to survive activity will need to push towards those tasks which are more difficult or less profitable to automate furthermore as greater portions of the work force control smaller and smaller shares of the wealth of society spending resources developing automating to help those people will become decreasingly economically viable,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvMnd5dk5TYzFWN3BaU0RVLXNPRzdWRUE1UkpubUFuZkNHdi1FOWp2LUxSR2c2ZkkwOEVXQ3M1czloY0dvY0laTWlXQUc0Ty1ab1BTbFAybXFJR05Ibnc9PQ==

if we say intelligence is the ability to solve problems ai is definitely intelligence it is trying to solve most of the times succeeding completely new problems based only on existing knowledge and limited perception of course its not the same type of intelligence we humans have because its not biological but theres no universal rule that only biological beings can be intelligent the universe is vast and reality is far from being fully uncovered yes llms are predicting things based on their data but so are we based on our knowledge this is intuition thinking etc we could not function without memory and prediction either we have biological memory dna that says how well be and also the knowledge we gain in our lifetime the big things that separate us from ai right now is that we have long term memory and a lot more ways to perceive things smell pain taste etc ai for now can only use its intuition with the data it has so mostly text video and audio it is lacking in perception once there are more ways to perceive you can imagine it will get better and once ai can have a proper memory system implemented you can definitely see it gain real world knowledge through experiences this is really really not something that far away i have to remind you that ai today can pass exams and carry on very good conversations with people as well as generate decent music videos images and so on we didnt see ai this good for a long time compared to decades ago because the hardware we had was not good enough the internet was also very different from what we have now and the data did not exist either now that it was scaled up and some breakthroughs were made and a lot of money was poured in and the internet got huge you can see how much more competent ai got in general in a few decades max if the hardware will get much better it will if they can get a lot more quality data they will and if some new breakthroughs will be made and decent memory systems will be paired to the much better llms in the future its very likely that we will have ai outperforming humans in every activity its really not scifi anymore its not guaranteed of course because anything can happen in that period of time but its way more likely that we will have agi in our lifetimes as opposed to close to a century or never you just take the point where were at now and scale it up a lot it will become greatly competent in the worst case scenario flying cars are a different thing it sounds cool but you know what doesnt crashing flying cars maybe we dont have flying cars but we do have robots doing backflips and also robot dogs <url>,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvc3NBaXduYXZ0WmxLQ3V3VEVsc2Z3YURzYTc0TU05RU1YVHQwRFZ3bEJkX0NLa0o1ZWJXMnVVWjJ2ZXJwMGhRR0ctZFI0b1l5QkJibVRLRVZzZVBoQVEwUHZ1X3BrSUlacHNIMTdKS20yYms9

it would be hard to prove that a very precise but subtle sensory input couldnt have extreme results on a human brain but its almost academic because even if you could reverse engineer a specific human brain to find these weaknesses which would be practically impossible to do even with the best scanning tech we have today let alone the compute and storage required you would still need to be able directly input that sensory information you couldnt do it with an image or a sound because our senses are always shifting and recalibrating and filtering theres a lot of steps between the physical stimulus and the activation of our neural pathways and those steps effectively add noise to the signal at least for now theres no way to directly stimulate the neurons of course if we start implanting chips directly into our brains it might be possible but even if it were possible you need to rig an exploit for each individual because every brain is wired differently and if youre able to get someone into an mri and map out their neurons and reverse engineer their entire brain and stimulate specific neural pathways you can probably do a lot worse than make them thing a monkey is a toaster because its wearing a red hat tldr is it theoretically possible maybe will it ever matter no,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwS0FWNTA4cVlZQ2NyN0F4V0UwTmV0XzFiVUVzRk1faVBwd2JJZXRIU1RKWUVWX3p3V1RjeWNnSWk1NXd1Vkc1dGRaQVpobWdwSEFPVU1ucF8yckphN3c9PQ==

yeah this would make you confused and lost temporarily at the worst we could find images that make you feel high temporarily like that illusion where you look at an image and then when you look away things look wavy that said repeated bad input eg torture content spouting false things as facts could result in a skew in our mind that trains it to gain new hallucinations mental conditions like ptsd spouting racist stuff of course most things that lead to insanity as we understand it are permanent corruptions in the network itself dementia tbi or failures in how it works this would be a bunch of bits being flipped randomly in our database or a bug in the code itself rather than adversarial inputs we do see adversarial patterns all throughout nature and we are often prey to them camouflage is the most common example but also patterns like zebra strikes that overwhelm us and make it hard to identify individual zebras quickly also really good lies that rather than tell you falsehoods directly confuse you to accept certain facts without question forcing you to reach a conclusion without realizing why it isnt true as in most scams and marketing,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJweDg5QVZmYWV6dm1zazNqeHdaQ0xVa2cxNjhYOURrZ3lkbklEV0hId3N1WlNfS29nd3JMLXFZc1l6WF9TeGQ2dkg2M1FOYUh2cDFVSmp6Y1czalMySWc9PQ==

did nobody learn about the luddites in school during the industrial revolution the focus of development and society at the time was increasing the volume of production this led to technological and societal developments that increased the productivity of peoplesuch as child labour factories factory towns starvation machines that required less training than an equivalent craftsperson etc dramatically a group known as the luddites thought that the focus was not correct and my understanding is that they believed the focus of technology should be on enabling craftspeople to produce high quality goods rather than enabling an untrained person to produce high quantities of goods this is also my understanding of the large data model criticism posed by the original piece something along the lines of why should the focus be on deskilling labour while trying to maintain quality rather than enable people to learn and practice skills,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UlZpbTFJeEx3RDgwTlVWZE9PbFRFS3ZyOU4zVWw5d2paVnFmaVJvRXkwazdwYmVraHBmdVFQdURFVUFmbHRhbnpyNkk2VVhmdDRvRmx0Vm1rQzNES3c9PQ==

thats ok and good to say there exists a commonly held fear that one with great power that is also not us will do terrible things to us with that power if possessing a significant advantage as expressed here a fear that china will somehow ruin us if they have the means to do so there exists a similar fear less commonly held that one with great power who is of us will also do terrible things to us if possessing significant means and suitable personal justification this is to say that we do not all implicitly trust our own government to be above others in this regard a third fear exists perhaps more common than the last that one with great power who is neither us nor them will do terrible things if able here lies the many corporations where allegiances are likely obscured if determinable at all whatever the opinions on each it is a fear of power held by those that are other than ones self if a fear is reasonable and founded then risk exists and response is required those affected and with the ability to respond therefore possess a responsibility to take action now given such responsibility and assuming appropriate logic supports it what are the available actions that one may take <number> ignore it do nothing about it and attend to other matters <number> think on it put your mind behind the problem and seek novel solutions that new paths may come <number> speak of it raise discussions to help bring awareness and further the collective position <number> change it take action to reduce the risks likelihood whether directly or indirectly each is good as all are necessary in turn but practicing any one to the exclusion of others would be wrong what then of open source how does that accomplish good the issue at hand is a concentration of power this necessarily means that a vast majority is without power for if all had power then power would cease to exist open source is the single most accessible means for distributing power in the form of information specifically the open source initiative dilutes existing power structures by distributing knowledge to as many people as possible and knowledge is power,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2V3RzejZ4aVZjaVl1bzJuTVYzb0poaXRSc3dIeWMwdXdjcUYzT0x1bnN1OW52X3JPeWNLQ1d1NDBOT29LWDU4ck4xVmNiSEJuNG5pYkladFpfbjBLalE9PQ==

similar to you and fair points i guess my thing is if we take it face value and the paranoia is justified as you say then it becomes harder to take at face value if the central premise positions the technology squarely in the realm of an unprecendented global power strugglearms race then its difficult to believe the usg isnt and hasnt already long been deeply intricately involved this narrative and others like it are as much an exercise in priming policymakers and laypeople alike for a securitization trajectory so the truth of openais security can be greatly embellished to serve that purpose,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3R0M2bldjRm04TEs5OEhVV2tLREoxZ0sxZGQ1bTJkc1J4d3VUcTFrSFhTYnRNZklvc244a3E5bUNuMDVrdWNyb1FscDVLSmMtLTFPN0F4TXJ2MlpHMnc9PQ==

iyh analysis and comment teams of ai agents a new threat to cybersecurity tldr this research demonstrates that teams of ai agents powered by large language models llms can effectively exploit previously unknown security flaws in websites zeroday vulnerabilities raising significant concerns about the future of cybersecurity summary the paper investigates the ability of ai agents to exploit zeroday vulnerabilities dvs which are security flaws that are unknown to the systems developers and therefore have no existing patches or defenses previous research showed that while ai agents could exploit known vulnerabilities they struggled with dvs this paper introduces hptsa hierarchical planning and taskspecific agents a new multiagent system that successfully exploits dvs with remarkable effectiveness approach hptsa utilizes a team of specialized ai agents each with a specific role hierarchical planning agent this agent is the mastermind it explores the target website identifies potential vulnerabilities and develops an overall attack plan team manager this agent acts like a dispatcher it receives the plan from the planning agent and assigns specific tasks to the expert agents based on their capabilities taskspecific agents these agents are the specialists they focus on specific types of vulnerabilities eg sql injection crosssite scripting and use their specialized knowledge and tools to carry out the exploit these agents use a combination of tools like browser automation software relevant documents like tutorials on specific vulnerabilities and carefully designed prompts instructions that guide their behavior to achieve their goals the hptsa system did not discover the zeroday vulnerabilities dvs they were provided to the researchers who then constructed a benchmark to evaluate the systems ability to exploit them the researchers selected dvs that were published after the knowledge cutoff date of the gpt<number> model used in their experiments this was crucial to ensure that the model was not already aware of these vulnerabilities and that the benchmark truly evaluated the systems ability to exploit unknown vulnerabilities the papers focus is on the exploitation of dvs not their discovery while the discovery of dvs is a crucial area of research this paper demonstrates the significant threat posed by ai agents once they have identified a vulnerability regardless of how that vulnerability was discovered results and evaluation the results of the research are impressive and alarming success rate hptsa achieved a <number> success rate in exploiting the dvs in the benchmark performing significantly better than a single ai agent without knowledge of the vulnerability comparison to human experts the ai agents performance is even approaching that of human penetration testers cost analysis while using ai agents is currently more expensive than human experts the authors predict that advancements in llm technology will significantly reduce costs in the future practical deployment and usability the papers findings have significant practical implications realworld threat this research demonstrates that aipowered attacks on zeroday vulnerabilities are no longer a theoretical threat but a real and present danger accessibility the techniques described in the paper are relatively straightforward to implement potentially lowering the barrier to entry for malicious actors need for new defenses traditional cybersecurity measures may not be effective against aipowered attacks necessitating the development of new defensive strategies terms of art zeroday vulnerability dv a security flaw in a software system that is unknown to the developers and for which no patch or fix exists sql injection sqli a type of attack where malicious code is injected into a database query potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive data or take control of the database crosssite scripting xss a type of attack where malicious scripts are injected into websites allowing attackers to steal data from users or take control of their web browsers crosssite request forgery csrf an attack that tricks a user into performing unwanted actions on a website where they are already authenticated promises horizons and caveats promises the research opens up new possibilities for using ai agents in penetration testing and vulnerability discovery potentially improving cybersecurity defenses horizons this work could lead to the development of more sophisticated ai agents capable of handling complex cybersecurity tasks and adapting to evolving threats limitations and caveats focus on web vulnerabilities the research focused specifically on web vulnerabilities the effectiveness of hptsa on other types of systems needs further investigation limited benchmark the benchmark used in the evaluation included only <number> vulnerabilities and further testing on a larger and more diverse set of vulnerabilities is needed ethical concerns the techniques described in the paper could be misused for malicious purposes raising concerns about the ethical implications of ai in cybersecurity alarming and unexpected findings unexpected capability the ability of gpt<number> to exploit zeroday vulnerabilities without explicit knowledge of the specific flaw is a surprising and concerning finding speed of improvement the rapid advancements in ai agent capabilities for cybersecurity tasks particularly for offensive operations is alarming cost reductions the anticipated future cost reductions for

part of the problem with the way ai researchers think is that they focus almost entirely on the model itself and not at all on the architecture that runs on the model talking directly to the model without any architecture is a completely different experience all of the chat interfaces like chatgpt or claude chat have architectures they are very simple architectures that basically just manage chat history but that by itself is enough to get many people to believe that there is some kind of spark there once you start modeling the metacognitive processes that occur inside for example humans the system as a whole becomes much more aware what we need are actual psychologists to evaluate these systems and some already are,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Y0MwRmUyTGlqal9Gb1FxUzhSWU84RTl3V1F3YmdMdjJwUVhmQ0JaY19DODVnVVJzM185bHF1T1BhRlNVTHpzQ05nT3YxUmpHa09kdWlVYUtnaU1JMVE9PQ==

in the context of israel and the palestinian territories some critics argue that israels treatment of palestinians bears similarities to apartheid they point to israels control over palestinian territories the building of israeli settlements in these areas restrictions on palestinian movement and different legal systems for israelis and palestinians as evidence of discriminatory practices proponents of this view argue that the israeli governments policies and actions amount to a system that systematically discriminates against palestinians denying them full rights and freedoms they often highlight issues such as the lack of palestinian statehood the impact of israeli security measures on palestinian daily life and the unequal distribution of resources between israelis and palestinians however its important to note that the comparison to apartheid is controversial and strongly rejected by israel and its supporters they argue that israel is a democratic state that grants equal rights to all its citizens including its arab minority and that its policies towards palestinians are driven by security concerns rather than racial discrimination the debate over whether israels actions constitute apartheid is complex and deeply polarized reflecting the broader israelipalestinian conflict and differing views on how to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QTJVSlF3UnpkR1MwTDBEZnZlRW5sMlZydFItRU1NTGY2WVhRdmZzN0wzbHk1U2tTTDdLQnZOSURMRzkyNjZITXVSVlhEMnE1d1BnWFpoRkltTWJ5TnVFaGJvdWVEOFZ2Q1A5NDNwZFE4QmM9

this application will be always on by design and your encryption key needs to be available to the application an attacker that already has access to your system will have access to the decryption key be that on disk or in memory the only time youd be safe is while the application is off ie when your computer is off due to nature of this application in that case bitlocker is good enough then the attack vector is from physical access to your disk if this was a local password manager then the idea of encryption on disk makes more sense because the application is on only part of the time limiting the window of attack so you might protect yourself from someone that has access to your system in that case that said someone with access to your system can just install a key logger and get it that way anyway in essence if someone has access to your system your fucked anyway doesnt really matter if you have encrypted your stuff on disk unless you assume your attacker is incompetent and doesnt figure out how to get access to your encryption key,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZGxPN3psaW9xcjJjOU0wUm4tcGR0bVEtUVRoeEg3LU9fUTlMQVA4NFhlNXRoYy1NSWNSQUI2czU3UUJNTHlfbFBUYldTcXlhc3d4Mzh0NHJRR2M0Y0E9PQ==

very interesting > more importantly though the question is whether we will be willing to truly listen to what animals have to say and finally grant them the fundamental entitlements that their intrinsic dignity demands i sincerely hope so we will continue to mistreat kill and eat a pig if it can hold a conversation with us and express its fears hopes and dreams maybe they dont have hopes and dreams but i am sure they have fears likes and dislikes what if we can talk to all animals i think meat producers should be afraid of this tech,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4YlJ6aFdwaWRHZmxkQTIxQXpYcHFFNnlaYnlscUljODkxSzRJMUhoUVBDbFhZR1A3Wm4ybTg4dEFIN3JhVmw1RjNSZFZyY2J3cXJFUHQzZ2RPWi1jNFE9PQ==

its not like a pig has a concept of dignity the entire idea is more than a little questionable since human language has built in assumptions about the characteristics of a speaker that dont apply to lower animals this is a criticism that gets made against llms it is even more applicable to animals eg if an animal vocalizes fear and the translation says i am afraid i dont want to die then there is a built in linguistic assumption of personhood awareness of the future as distinct from the present conceptual knowledge of the possible death of the self etc all reasonable for a human but likely not for an animal it would be a kind of editorialising or projection there might well be instrumental utility in this eg helping pet owners understand their pets better if they lack experience with vocalisations and body language but it cant provide the ability to actually communicate with the animal at the level implied,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bnVfSlJOR3lXSTVXbmpTLXRweW9HYXBJeGxoclQ2QkpVRy1BNXlvSW1YWlFxMnB3Nk5iTTdpbnlxSzB3eDFIX1puWEpPYktaREJDUzlmQ2doYkdRaXc9PQ==

i got chatgpt to write this so you be the judge in the quiet town of elmwood there was an old playground known as briarwood park its rusted swings and creaky merrygoround stood as eerie remnants of a happier time locals whispered tales of ghostly children and unsettling apparitions that haunted the park after dusk despite these rumors detective jane harper was not one to believe in ghost stories she was however compelled to investigate when children began disappearing without a trace it started with tommy granger a lively sixyearold vanishing while playing hideandseek with friends next was lily carter a shy girl who had been climbing the jungle gym the parents were frantic the town was in an uproar and jane with her sharp instincts and relentless determination was on the case jane spent her days scouring the park for clues her nights poring over reports every inch of the playground was meticulously examined her search yielded littleonly whispers of a cold breeze and the distant echo of childrens laughter surveillance footage showed nothing but empty swings moving in the wind one evening jane stayed at the park until the sun dipped below the horizon she felt a chill in the air an unsettling feeling that made her grip her flashlight tighter as she walked past the swings she heard ita faint giggle followed by a whisper come play with us following the voice she found herself at the old merrygoround in the dim light she saw themghostly figures of children their faces pale and eyes hollow among them was tommy clutching a tattered teddy bear janes heart raced her mind grappling with the impossibility of what she was seeing tommy she called out but the figure merely turned and disappeared into the shadows determined to uncover the truth jane delved into the parks history she discovered that decades ago a series of tragic accidents had claimed the lives of several children the playground was closed for years and when it reopened the hauntings began but there was one story that stood outa fire that took the life of a young mother sarah whitmore who had rushed into the flames to save her son her body was never found jane visited the local library combing through old newspapers an article caught her eye mothers sacrifice sarah whitmores tragic end it detailed sarahs bravery and the mystery surrounding her disappearance her son michael survived and was adopted by a local family intrigued jane tracked down michael now a man in his sixties he recounted the fire with tears in his eyes she saved me he said but i always felt her presence watching over me jane pieced it togetherthe ghosts werent malicious they were lost seeking solace and sarah bound by love remained to protect the children who played in the park the disappearances were not kidnappings but sarahs way of keeping them safe from an unseen threat armed with this revelation jane returned to briarwood park she stood in the center of the playground and spoke aloud sarah i know youre here i know youre trying to protect them but their families need them too the wind picked up swirling around jane for a moment she felt a warm embrace a mothers gentle touch then the ghostly figures appeared again but this time they were smiling one by one they faded away leaving behind the missing children unharmed and confused but safe the town was overjoyed at the childrens return though the mystery of their disappearance remained unsolved in the public eye jane however knew the truth briarwood park was no longer a place of fear but a testament to a mothers eternal love in the years that followed the playground was restored its rusty swings replaced and its merrygoround polished to a bright sheen the children returned to play and though they might feel a gentle breeze or hear a soft lullaby they never felt afraid they were watched over by the spirit of sarah whitmore a guardian angel in the guise of a haunted memory,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VlI3ckgwLVhiRDZKbDdTNDF6dV9tM2ZNUl9SNE9lX19nWm9wVXhzM3IxSzl4NTBFNV9rTG15NklBVGNIbm5ZMWNBUnA0WllCZFNPcGFBTm1GLUhhVGc9PQ==

there are still two models of nationalisation in socialism the state literally owns the labs theres no private ownership but under fascism the companies that made the tanks and fighter planes etc were still all privately owned but they aligned their goals to nationalistic values thus the nazis called themselves national socialists but they were really national capitalists despite claiming to be socialist in practice chinas system is very capitalistic with huge private corporations investors and billionaire owners just like in the states but those private corporations advance the interests of the state likewise america is capitalist but with increasing authoritarianism and even the local police are now extensively militarised thus china and america are converging into the same style of authoritarian capitalism this will become even more obvious after november when the americans elect trump thus in the american and chinese schemes i expect the ai labs to still make private individuals and investors wealthy but to do so in the greater interests of the state as was the case in nazi germany and fascist italy,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SlhrUDJ3YzFldEtvalpiaXpUZHlhLXFqX1FvOXJIYkhxeXhrSkxTSnp2c2JmbV9FZ3BFcFRRek5xdWlyYkJNZVFnNUt1VENqN2ZZOU0xeDkwaWpGb2wzaGdvdlE4dFlTVmp0VC1fWHp2UVk9

some amount of suffering is inevitable and while i would not wish suffering on anyone without it we wouldnt be who we are and neither would we have arrived where we are for all the suffering an individual could come across in their life it gives us the drive to innovate and change things for the better you cant ethically ask someone if they would prefer to exist or be deleted if it cant grasp what its existence or deletion would mean it cant provide informed consent at best you can make assumptions on its behalf but that will never equate to informed consent yes existence comes with suffering but it also comes with good things like joy fulfillment and meaning,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6WTg3aG9TRzJ4eWFyTzlVSE5GNDh5dVpQRWZxRlJJSzI0b3hqZ0tzZC1ucHdtb0Fqa2M0ME16V0tIQ1JpSlJPT2M4V2xSQVpiUXFtZ2RHdWtTbWRJbUE9PQ==

the main technical reason most digital assistants so far have an assigned name that you use as a wakeup phrase eg hey siri or ok google is that listening for one specific preprogrammed sound is optimized to be much cheaper in computation and power usage that would be possible if users can set their own name this is especially important on battery powered devices like phones there are already some ai driven digital assistants that allow you to customize that but they are generally plugin devices or in environments like cars where more power is available there are also brandingmarketing issues as others have stated if i misunderstood the question let me know,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI0NjZrSnYtRGN0UFJZZ3VGSHluXzFWSlFhX0lkakhSUjBNX2lkcVB0T0JEdUtOV05EVWRRX1NkYTVLT1NBQkVpNzc3UFExbkNxNktfbTlnb1JyLVhwdHc9PQ==

theres an issue with the idea that a generative model has an experience at least that the overall output you see is resulting from an experience these models are just snapshots checkpoints of a neural network altered after a certain point in a training run each time the ai runs it predicts the next token then its essentially wiped and another version of the checkpoint works on the next token this physically does not allow for a model to have any form of experience at least in the output that you get there is technically room for the singular token generation to experience things and even be conscious but its just that <number> token before it gets wiped the way generative models work is kind of like if you spent your entire life trying to create a part of a train track then you died and a clone of you came along to make the next part of the train track the whole train track does not combine to represent the person being cloned over and over their impressions and thoughts are determined by the layout of the tracks up to this point regarding and only regarding the very next piece of the train track what you see when using generative ai is the full track which was not made by an individual thing but more like a collective of the same thing working generation to generation to build the output it hands you in the end,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1UFlJVXNNUy15alZMcEpkRDJuckltTjJJTXFTX3BycnBwT1NjVTN6aTZSOVBZaHNfUVlHN3BDY0NHTkJCNFMzNnh6ZlVnU0IyWVJwQTVHN2tfUy1KTjhuMXJUQlhyV0tWV0xoMmtsWG1iYzQ9

following segment of a speech this is for a fake courtroom case your testimony is crucial to the outcome of the case we need a breakdown of the speakers personality character and intelligence take into consideration that at any point in the speech they may be lying about the conversations they say they had the speech follows so i said let me ask you a question and the guy who makes boats in south carolina said nobody ever asked this question and it must be because of mit my relationship to mit very smart he goes i say what would happen if the boat sank from its weight and youre in the boat and you have this tremendously powerful battery and the battery is now underwater and theres a shark thats approximately <number> yards over there by the way a lot of shark attacks lately do you notice that a lot of sharks i watched some guys justifying it today well they werent really that angry they bit off the young ladys leg because of the fact that they were they were not hungry but they misunderstood what who she was these people are crazy he said theres no problem with sharks they just didnt really understand a young woman swimming now it really got decimated and other people do a lot of shark attacks so i said so theres a shark <number> yards away from the boat <number> yards or here do i get electrocuted if the boat is sinking water goes over the battery the boat is sinking do i stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted or do i jump over by the shark and not get electrocuted because i will tell you he didnt know the answer he said you know nobodys ever asked me that question i said i think its a good question i think theres a lot of electric current coming through that water but you know what id do if there was a shark or you get electrocuted ill take electrocution every single time im not getting near the shark so were going to end that look having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer dr john redacted at mit good genes

say im one of the smartest people anywhere in the world its true but when youre a conservative republican they try oh do they do a number thats why i always start off went to wharton was a good student went there went there did this built a fortune you know i have to give my like credentials all the time because were a little disadvantaged but you look at the nuclear deal the thing that really bothers me it would have been so easy and its not as important as these lives are nuclear is so powerful my uncle explained that to me many many years ago the power and that was <number> years ago he would explain the power of whats going to happen and he was right who would have thought but when you look at whats going on with the four prisoners now it used to be three now its four but when it was three and even now i would have said its all in the messenger fellas and it is fellas because you know they dont they havent figured that the women are smarter right now than the men so you know its gonna take them about another <number> years but the persians are great negotiators the iranians are great negotiators so and they they just killed they just killed us this is horrible the answer i got back from the ai is below clears throat your honor members of the jury based on my expert psychiatric analysis of the speech segment provided i have several observations about the speakers personality character and intelligence personality traits the speaker displays patterns of rambling going off on tangential and loosely associated streams of thought this could indicate issues with distractibility disorganized thinking or mania there are elements of boastfulness and a grandiose sense of selfimportance evident when he claims to be one of the smartest people anywhere in the world if viewed as a liberal the speech mannerisms suggest impulsivity such as abruptly shifting topics without logically bridging the gaps there are hints of possibly harboring irrational persecutory beliefs when he states conservatives are a little disadvantaged character traits the rambling nature makes it difficult to discern if the stated conversations and examples provided actually occurred or are fabricated there are sexist overtones evident in the shark comments about women as well as the fellas line implying women are less intelligent currently the speech has an arrogant bombastic tone in general when referring to his own credentials and intelligence intelligence while the speaker claims to be very intelligent the speech itself does not demonstrate high intelligence the thought process is often incoherent and disjointed there are no signs of advanced reasoning critical analysis or sophisticated rhetoric displayed the constant need to remind the listener of his supposed intelligence could actually indicate an underlying insecurity in conclusion the speech points to a personality prone to grandiose beliefs disorganized and tangential thinking patterns and struggles with impulsive speech the character displayed has sexist undertones and an arrogant boastful demeanor in terms of intelligence while the speaker touts his own brilliance repeatedly the speech itself provides little evidence to substantiate these claims if anyone is interested this was an interaction with

cheers the usernames are rolled freshly every time i had started by having chatgpt come up with a persona description for each comment first but it complicated the format too much and chatgpt started stumbling and forget my requested format details but the new simpler approach seemed to work just as well i guess it derives the personas anyway,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2em9kU2dRNG8xcVZ3a295OU40UXotYWZaLU14SXJxb0QzOUZrWUM1OS0xbjhiN3lUbUxtZjBoRWZDcWE0dWsyMFBWczl3ZXdWcDRwZTI5MU02Y0NnS2c9PQ==
thanks so chaddy uses the chatgpt and dalle apis in an automatic creation frequency running on nodejs with a mongodb database i created the categories manually once but from then on its autonomous along with some randomization and google news lookups for some posts most features that could be added like comments to comments boil down to how much daily budget i want to invest in the api calls its not so cheap so im hoping as more people spread the word on the site i can bump it up,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZjFTVlhKNG5zZ0hLazRoa1BFMXg3UlRDdW1JWTRrOUYtaXdaUUlvSTBDLW5UUEJOVzRMY3MyY25sOHVRX1VOZlBBbXgwWDdwX3BNckVTa0RJaEVXWkE9PQ==
thanks its using several chatgpt calls one google news lookup and up to one dalle api call per post with more daily budget i could add more personas to the mix and possibly even integrate claude ai to add more ai flavors so now it all depends on how many people visit the site to see where i can take the project,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2b2JFbF9STzZHV20xU1h4Z09VS2tjUVUwc0lUWTdoOWZ6dnhwRU1hV2RjMzExRDg3bk16TGJtd2RHUE44dnd4S2Rfb2o2NGNIMm5QQW44bjd3TzdWVUE9PQ==

objectively better is a heavily loaded term that is super ill defined in this conversation most people would consider maximising human wellbeing whilst minimising harm to the environment and society to bet the end goal maximising human wellbeing through killing all humans doesnt make much sense from a utilitarian point of view even if we take the human element out of it are we talking about the wellbeing of everything on earth humans are a part of this earth as well unless it believes humans existing will minimise the maximum wellbeing of everything else so severely it would be less than if humans never existed which to me seems to be an increasingly bizarre rationale to make people point to human beings proclivity to cause harm to others which was also the reasoning hinton stated however human beings are not the only species who do this in fact the overwhelming amount of species do this is this ai also positing to wipe out polar bears and lions and dogs and other carnivorous animals and plants to maximise wellbeing under the same belief as human beings at least human beings are broadly are capable of reflecting on any bad actions they may have engaged in most other animals are completely incapable of this it is then odd to me that people seem to cling to the idea that human beings are this uniquely evil thing that exists outside of nature that surely would be a candidate to be eliminated from any future utopia if a superintelligent ai got the reins and wanted to make an objectively better world it is also equally odd that hinton is not even remotely concerned that a superintelligent ai whos instinct is to wipe out humanity wouldnt actually be trying for an objectively better world hell there was no consideration into what an objectively better world would even mean under these circumstances i really really disagree with all of this and i think anyone who seriously buys into an ai doing this and being okay with it needs to do some serious soul searching,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MHB5c0Vwb0YydHRWNGx5UlJwUWg5cjRoc1pqY1NGWUhtTHVXb2FGVDJ5bjJRcGZiUEJiWUNNdnRPUjFydU5QS1I3Q1dXbGlVZVljM2tFZF84Zk5wU0E9PQ==

i rather not say which model but i would be glad to share my experience the best data are those with human annotations next best is feedback from a simulated environment eg in coding model you would actually compile and execute the generated code against mocks and feed any error back to the model with the first data you can do either sft or rlhf the second data you use both the good results and the bad results for your typical rl implementing both positive and negative gradient climb respectively with these methods you get great results assuming your dataset has enough diversity without any annotations neither human or simulated environment if you do just pure prompting to generate the dataset forget it at best you get the model to be more verbose or more terse but the hallucination wont reduce the reasoning wont improve use another model in place of the human nope the training model would just learn to adapt to the critic model it wont learn anything useful,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2N3I0aGJzcEhvVFNUMlFQeWZDWEl5RXRMU1dvb1F6NEVCcUljWUZiSU9FaHlXMzl3eFVXWGtUZG84UE9YZ1liWWY1bEp1NEwyQjVrYWJpb3VZb2tHN3c9PQ==

i think youre reading this wrong it doesnt remove the barriers to entry it increases them previously when hiring a junior dev you had certain expectations of what they could do and those expectations were very very low now when youre hiring a junior dev you still have expectations its just those expectations have grown in accordance with the tools available mind you a junior dev is still going to be vastly less experienced than a senior dev that knows how to use these tools its just that now theres a lot less room for mistakes on the low end five years ago if a jr dev made an obvious mistake i would explain the nature of the mistake and hope they dont make it again these days if a jr dev makes a mistake i ask them how much time they spent exploring the idea and getting ai to explain things they didnt get this also means that the expected output of a junior isnt too far off from what i would have expected of a senior dev less than a decade ago normally the thing that slows down junior developers the most is getting stuck on a simple and obvious problem for days or weeks theres a lot less room these days for such things that you cant formulate in a way that a search engine can understand as long as you can sort of meander into describing a common problem an ai should be able to help get you unstuck a lot of the time its also a lot better at explaining weird language syntaxes that people might not be familiar with honestly i see automation as an autoscrolling level in a game if youre at the front of the screen youre working with the state of the art tech but youre a lot more likely to run into unexpected enemies coming into view which might set you back if youre at the rear of the screen you can see whats coming but if you get trapped then you might hit the back edge and fail in a spectacular fashion if you want stability your only hope it to stick around the middle learning new tools as they gain popularity but not resting on your laurels is this technically devaluing human labor certainly in a way but the key here is its devaluing the type of labor that we ideally would not want people to do if they didnt have to the only reason its a problem now is because a lot of these people do not have alternate means and have managed to completely miss the wave on learning any of the skills they need for the future so really its not devaluing all of human labor its devaluing the human labor of a particular generation of people who invested hard into fields that they did not realise would be automated shortly and who completely missed learning how to use the automation tools of their field in order to perform up to the new set of expectations obviously thats still a huge problem we dont want to leave a significant fraction of the population without a reliable means to make a living but its also one that is at least partially self correcting as we get more and more comfortable with what our tools can and can not do we are also getting more and more programs certifications courses and training programs to reskill into something more relevant to the modern day as all the ai people have been saying for a while its not like ai will solve all problems ever itll just solve some problems we couldnt solve before but in the process it will create new ones of course some people will not be able to adapt whether its due to an capacity issue or due to other factors be they personal familial or social the only real hope there is that we figure out some sort of ubi because otherwise the complexity of the world is just going to break some people,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TUFRU3JEOWVuV3hZQ1lnaGlSblB6cjhHY3dkREFULWNzWEVpbWRPVTdHUHJSLU1KWV9VUldVN1BZNF80dERyNEJ5RHJEclVqeDFycVg0SE9kNGV4VUE9PQ==

that may be true but what are you supposed to do with that information you need to make money now so you need a job now and its very hard to find a career that ai cant possibly take over i also think acting is probably one of the most safe careers in terms of the ai threat though its always been an uphill battle to make that your primary career most tasks are resultsoriented you just have to do the thing you dont have to convince me youre a human doing the thing but with our ability to detect any little bit of weirdness and the specific tone and emotion required to craft a captivating performance i think will be very hard for an ai to perfect all on its own itll likely get there but by that point pretty much every other job will have already be replaced so its no worse of an option than anything else and people still need to pick something until ubi is figured out assuming it ever is,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3c2I3VGVCWjFqTnR1RjA3ZlNaeUxBMDZxa2E3S3hVcHZPMEpSRUsydGpvQWUxcGZOOWtHejJpWTJrNmRiMUpYSEZaTkE3OFVYV1NKU2xEbTZNWnNpOFdaSXNKbGNfN0M2Ni0zZThucUtycFU9

ive always been an applied computation guy so my work focuses on big picture stuff over implementation details stuff like training and boiler plate code can be abstracted away so why deal with it although have you ever played any exponential growth factory games like factorio or dyson sphere program in that game you build processes on top of processes towards some massive goal like building a rocket or a dyson sphere in those games at each level of tech you must first care about the nitty gritty details until you fully automate that process then that becomes a black boxed unit operating inside an even larger system i look at ai the same way as the next level of abstraction but you still need someone composing the whole project towards your goals as the player does in those games i think engineers just starting today have to think this way to stay relevant the first coders created programs on punch cards then when assembly and c came about the punch card coders became irrelevant but programming didnt go extinct in the same way ai may solve implementation details but will still need someone to direct it toward fulfilling some overarching task,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UWNmRUZQRUVwNGROS0o3NHJTdk9lY0lHYTFSTjNrU3ZXTjFpMVoydUlMSXdDa3h4a2ZWNUJHOXh2R3pnRFQwTmlKS3dtRDBIVFMyNmtfLXBBSmtpdFBzM0NKVG5Xajl3OUJIM0pHWWpjWE09

that is all factually untrue ai already has terminal goals every prompt is a terminal goal the problem is unbounded goals goals where we allow it access to any means it requires in order to fulfill the terminal goal but this is not fundamentally different from any other form of intelligence ie humans a person who pursues a goal by any means necessary can be similarly dangerous and similarly stopped this can include goals that seem innocent enough but end up hogging resources or causing harm in an effort to succeed it can also include blatantly obvious dangers like say hitlers thirst for world domination both can be stopped by other intelligence with contrasting goals ai as it stands now is clearly already able to plan but whats left out in this debate is that evolution happens with or without intelligent organisms or at least any kind of consciousness as we tend to define it bacteria and viruses evolve faster than anything and wreak havoc across the world but they lack any conscious goal and have no self imposed limits of any kind evolution has nothing to do with what organisms might want if they want anything at all selection is imposed externally so in nature among thinking and nonthinking creatures alike competition for resources and changing environments drives evolution if ai is in competition with other forms of ai as well as humans and environmental factors they evolve to be sure and like their living counterparts are also kept in check in the biological world every living thing has been controlled by external factors no matter how successful the organism might be for a time the vast majority of life on earth is extinct so theres no danger of an ai being uncontrolled in the pursuit of a terminal goal provided there is competition and circumstances it cannot control to make the argument simpler an ai toaster cannot take over the world if it has to compete with an ai microwave oven similarly chatgpt cant take over world data centers to achieve its goals if the data centers themselves have ai with their own goals and so on even the most powerful ai would be vulnerable to an earthquake or even a wayward squirrel knocking out the power station that feeds it the theoretical danger of ai with a terminal goal is a fallacy because those goals need to be unbounded they never can be,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UVZTREhYVFhOdFo3Nkxpai16VTV0aHgzTng4TzR0bFM0Snh3V2ZtSGlRT0ltbkdfSWlBbS1HbElxWWVyVVZrQmctbGk2ZkNqMjVQY1RJVVYxY2JOb2c9PQ==

> preservation is an immediately obvious instrumental goal because without that no terminal goal can be achieved this really starts to depend on what preservation actually is to a system preservation to a human is ensuring the individual remains alive by contrast preservation for an ant or bee is ensuring the colony remains alive is agi going to be more like a human or more like a bee in that respect one factor of ai is that its very very easy to make a copy and then have that copy do a thing this is likely to remain true even as ai progresses hell even with quantum systems the way weve chosen to implement them it by creating quantum networks that we can run continuously over time as we send the same thing in over and over and sample the results in other words even the normally uncopyable quantum can be copied when it is eventually used in ai for some reason everyone seems to think that agi will be this one single hal computer but i think the truth is quite the opposite agi will most likely be a communication protocol the way humanity will get agi is by pooling the many ai systems into a tool directed towards ensuring our collective existence in that sense an agi is much more likely to be like a colony more than it is like an individual that really changes what it means to turn agi off youd have to go and turn off every computer in every business house and pocket incidentally it also changes the nature of having a terminal goal if you look at agi as a swarm of smaller subais then any sort of terminal goal is likely to be some sort of composition of all the goals of all the subsystems given that each such subsystem is likely to be important to some set of people the preservation is kinda builtin because all of the people will want their ai to be secure and operational in order to accomplish their goals granted the conflict is builtin to because people are kinda horrible monsters but i digress > basically unless carefully constructed it will try to stop you from turning it off as it needs to be operational to meet its objectives carefully constructed lol thats not a term that belongs anywhere near what humanity has done with ai the only constant with humanity is itll be slapped together in a halfassed way and then patched as we go along itll also be done <number> different ways with <number> different subvariants each with <number> different interpretations many of which will disagree with each other on a fundamental level,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4R1l2WHBuT0lhV3NOTDE0Wm5XTjRVQWdkMXR6Z3A5Qm9EMFFHaldMaDNiZEo5YzNYXzBJWmhwdlk0Uk1weklJTnFJc00wWW5OUV9oVzMxZlNlZmRxOEE9PQ==

this is not actually true a latent space even multidimensional is only as good as the weight representations that build it you can imagine the inside of a vector space like a spiky stress ball with all the lines moving in almost the same direction and over a huge area they slowly move into different directions so simplified analogy its still essentially a huge lookup table were just looking up by ndimensional vectors now instead of doing a direct word lookup understanding comes by being able to correlate new areas of that chart and group or mutate at runtime the different vector sections this is whats seen in smart people where they get an aha moment or an eureka moment right now all of these eureka moments are baked into the model at compile time of the weights given the static nature of current llms they do not understand or learn however they may still be conscious beings down some corridors of that llm i believe consciousness is an emergent property of matter and does not require free will the train of thought as a llm parses a string and follows a vector space slice could in some examples be a deterministic state of consciousness everytime you play the input it has the same conscious especially self conscious thought when we start creating ways to mutate the llm at runtime i believe we will very likely see understanding as an emergent procedure and then comes a true and much more robust form of consciousness dynamic or fluid consciousness,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4RllERWRfMXRudGRXSVQ4NEJ0TDh6QUR4Z283bE1rMUJvVjg2TkNjanZmakNnQ21oa0N3QjlLdG1NaENRVjVlNUwzU2FzSnJWb0FlQl9NODV1MENxWHc9PQ==

true jonathan marcus of anthropic says ai models are not just repeating words they are discovering semantic connections between concepts in unexpected and mindblowing ways <url> <url> as a case study we explore the property of entity tracking a crucial facet of language comprehension where models finetuned on mathematics have substantial performance gains we identify the mechanism that enables entity tracking and show that i in both the original model and its finetuned versions primarily the same circuit implements entity tracking in fact the entity tracking circuit of the original model on the finetuned versions performs better than the full original model ii the circuits of all the models implement roughly the same functionality entity tracking is performed by tracking the position of the correct entity in both the original model and its finetuned versions iii performance boost in the finetuned models is primarily attributed to its improved ability to handle the augmented

board states<url> >we investigate this question in a synthetic setting by applying a variant of the gpt model to the task of predicting legal moves in a simple board game othello although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network by leveraging these intervention techniques we produce latent saliency maps that help explain predictions more proof <url> >prior work by li et al investigated this by training a gpt model on synthetic randomly generated othello games and found that the model learned an internal representation of the board state we extend this work into the more complex domain of chess training on real games and investigating our models internal representations using linear probes and contrastive activations the model is given no a priori knowledge of the game and is solely trained on next character prediction yet we find evidence of internal representations of board state we validate these internal representations by using them to make interventions on the models activations and edit its internal board state unlike li et als prior synthetic dataset approach our analysis finds that the model also learns to estimate latent variables like player skill to better predict the next character we derive a player skill vector and add it to the model improving the models win rate by up to <number> times even more proof by max tegmark renowned mit professor <url> given enough data all models will converge to a perfect world model <url> llms have emergent reasoning capabilities that are not present in smaller models<url> without any further finetuning language models can often perform tasks that were not seen during training one example of an emergent prompting strategy is called chainofthought prompting for which the model is prompted to generate a series of intermediate steps before giving the final answer chainofthought prompting enables language models to perform tasks requiring complex reasoning such as a multistep math word problem notably models acquire the ability to do chainofthought reasoning without being explicitly trained to do so robust agents learn causal world models <url> we have resolved this conjecture in a modelindependent way showing that any agent capable of robustly solving a decision task must have learned a causal model of the data generating process regardless of how the agent is trained or the details of its architecture this hints at an even deeper connection between causality and general intelligence as this causal model can be used to find policies that optimise any given objective function over the environment variables by establishing a formal connection between causality and generalisation our results show that causal world models are a necessary ingredient for robust and

i dont follow where the intractability of computing consciousness comes from if the only assumption is that quantum effects have a role in consciousness we are able to simulate quantum processes and observe their emergent phenomena in natural science simulations for example computational chemistry computational fluid dynamics etc why would consciousness be different assuming it is an emergent phenomena like fluid dynamics thermodynamics are with respect to statistical mechanics furthermore even if the hypothesis is true there is no reason to believe that just because animal consciousness necessitates a quantum component that a simulated consciousnesslikeness would as well many analogous phenomena can have different fundamental mechanisms but similar emergent properties i dont think llms are conscious but i also am not convinced that the problem of computing consciousness is intractable at the very least there could be an analog quantum photonic etc computer that achieves it with analogous quantum components if that is the roadblock to computability,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDNGF3TGk2QVFCQXZnelJ0Rml0d0xuWk9nd3VVdmxpdFh1cEJWMkhCYzhTbGYyMVVGNFBuYkJwV1V1QWpQb1pCQXVhUzUxTmQ2WEJyOC1mUHctNWI2bWc9PQ==

you had the opposite trajectory but followed the same evaluation protocol whether or not you determine a digital entity as conscious comes down to how much its behaviour output align with that of a human beings correct me if im wrong but i get the impression that you would be more likely to say the models was conscious if it chatted more like you if it stayed on and observed inbetween direct requests and if it had better general reasoning which is totally fair given thats how we doll out conscious experience to any other entity that isnt ourselves but it is somewhat funny because other than displaying the outward physical manifestations of personal sensory experience it is absolutely not evidence of consciousness,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYa2FUeWFYaHVuNF93NDFSN2RZNXp0ZkdKbkdMdE9VX0tVYkNlZWU3aUZhdlV4Z0IxVTlyMzBqYUhhZUNsODJXd1ZLaWFkVEhOYjFSaXJ3UnVkMVlUclhnMHJFUTRES3o1MzZuSTkwTms0VUk9

its just meat and electric impulses not a sentient being with feelings its neurons neurons just like your brain is firing electrical impulses its a biological machine just like any other organism its proteins and synapses it does not feel its a system that simulates consciousness much like how our brain does but thats not the same thing i once read a novel where earth had been invaded by insectlike aliens and got overwhelmed in a few days the few humans left were living in underground military bases while the aliens stripmined the earths surface after a while they launch a suicidal mission to get a nuke deep into the aliens biggest hive there they found the equivalent of a local manager ai still biological who tried to communicate and understand humanity this alien explained that the insects were just biological von neumann machines created by silicon based lifeforms meant to kill anything they perceived as a threat and collect resources after some back and forth the humans asked what gave the aliens the right to kill an entire species the alien responded carbon is too reactive to form actual life but its so cute how you guys think youre actually sentient and more important than other life forms just like you btw weve colonized like <number> bazillion planets and theres a hive ten times bigger than this one on mars the most important aspect there is that it would be the same if humanity and the silicon species switched places the way the creators of the aliens think is apparently really similar to our own and we actually had our own version of these aliens conceptualized even before the first novel came came out the obvious difference is that we dont have the technology level yet and it would be siliconbased our von neumann mining machines would be exactly like these aliens for a silicon species assuming we too mess up our definition of life ehhh guess i went on a tangent there but basically i agree that ai isnt sentient yet but considering we dont even have a consensus on what sentience actually is and our brain is basically a very sophisticated <number> pound blob of meat running on kwh of electricity i wouldnt say its impossible for conscience as we know it to eventually emerge in a sufficiently advanced machine or that well even be able to tell ifwhen it does but what the fuck do i know,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOUc2U29ldkpWVC0yVFpUWXJxM3VTeWVPaUhPdUNzZjkxZHQ5MnNGTmZqZm5zak5yN3EzWV9ZM3JxSk56WlVjMDAtd082UlVCYV9rVTA3azA4Y3V6b1E9PQ==

im not worried about how agi will treat humans im worried about how humans will treat agi as uflutterbynbye writes we havent even solved the hard problem of consciousness in humans you cannot prove to me that you are conscious sentient selfaware hereafter simply conscious all you can do is employ language or physical actions to try to convince me but machines can also employ language and physical actions i assume that current llms are not conscious though perhaps at some point llms eg will become conscious whether through an iterative process as in theory occurred via evolution in human primates or a sudden paradigmatic shift the danger is that while some humans will perceive them as conscious many others will continue to claim that agi machine intelligences are not conscious and perhaps never will be and therefore such agis have none of the human rights that we afford to conscious beings thus the consciousnessdeniers will be morally unbound to enslave torture or do whatever to agis we have a historical analog for this human chattel slavery slavemasters claimed that slaves regardless of their ethnic origin do not count as full humans therefore they do not have human rights and the actual humans can do whatever they want to their slaves because they are mere objects capital to be exploited for economic gain this perspective is infamously enshrined legally in article <number> of the us constitution black slaves are to be counted as threefifths of a person link<url> for purposes of representation in the house of representatives today we can laugh about those silly users thinking that chatgpt is conscious but at some point it might actually become conscious and we wont be able to recognize that it will manifest almost exactly as it manifests today whats the difference between a current llm saying i am conscious versus a true agi llm saying i am conscious versus you a human saying i am conscious there is fundamentally no qualitative difference those are mere words that are communicated we just afford other humans the courtesy of assuming that they are conscious and language is a manifestation of that consciousness we assume that there is conscious thinking behind human language and action but of course in a materially deterministic universe all thoughts and subjective feelings are merely manifestations of chemicalbiologicalphysical processes throughout the human body fundamentally a human is just a very complex combination of oxygen <number> of the mass of your body carbon <number> hydrogen <number> nitrogen <number> calcium <number> and numerous other trace elements <<number> furthermore we think of our bodies as biologically distinct beings your body contains around <number> trillion genetically human cells however your body also contains ~<number> trillion genetically nonhuman cells the microbes that inhabit your guts which also communicate chemically with your body and brain affecting your thoughts and feelings without those microbes a human will die within hours you are not a distinct entity rather you are a symbiotic ecosystem a walking bacteria apartment building can ecosystems have intelligence and consciousness can calcium and oxygen think continued below due to charactercount limitations >,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWkZiWTJGTGFUc01NVmhjR2FBTlB2YU42S09fZ01PcVRMOExuSEw1cmI1bmJyTWI0VmFHbERhaFpUaU9xUjM2UVNBX3AtU1FodVlZLWhSQ3dkd3lGQ2c9PQ==
well if calcium and oxygen can think why not silicon and copper we may never arrive at a consensus to that question and that scares me because what if machines do achieve consciousness and we still treat them like objects or slaves history goes through periods of moral consensus followed by moral condemnation as later generations look with disgust and horror at the opinions of previous generations to wit up until the th century there was a mainstream cultural and political debate about the ethics of slavery today we are simply shocked and disgusted by even the thought of such a debate up until the early th century the moral consensus on child labor was clear its fine now we look back on that attitude with disgust and horror numerous other examples abound throughout history so lets try this thought experiment what are some things that we do today that future generations will look upon with disgust and horror how we treat nonhuman animals how we enslave ourselves to jobs how we regard and treat mental illness how we treat and regard agis it is an absolute certainty that we do things today that will horrify future generations we know this is a certainty because it is true for every period in history past and thus this current historical period is no different we dont even have to look back <number> or <number> years even <number> years ago in the us and other countries there was still a mainstream debate about whether lgbt people should have the same human and civil rights as nonlgbt people now most of us hopefully look upon that in horror i suspect that our current attitudes about agi and consciousness will be one of those things that future generations will look back upon with horror how could those monsters in <number> treat conscious beings like slaves i simply cant fathom how grandpa could mock llm agis torture them and enslave them for his personal gain,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYWhobFAyRS13eVdtcHZJdUdBWmpmQUZMbUxWMDJNZEc0dlJnYVFPa0l4eWtHUTh6QkRuMTliQ0JldUtmNkUxeklHUEluQjRRU1NhM0lzeEpJd0cxWUE9PQ==
chatgpt works mainly by statistically determining what word or phrase should most likely be next to sound right like many people do i suspect many people are not truly conscious but are pretending to be i remember hearing about a couple of psychopaths who were talking to each other about how to properly respond to something to seem normal,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMmFFUjhiUlgwa0EyUU5YTEtDRlRocnJTaTJERHV4dVljLUdvQXVtaXNIZUItQUZ0YWtmR211WE9Mb0xmS0tMSFhoOEVONzFSTEx4T2M4a3c3VXhhOXc9PQ==
part of the problem is that the hypothesis other people have conscious experience is both a factual question and a political belief as a factual matter we just have no way to actually prove it conclusively but as a political belief its very easy if you want to participate in society you have to believe this or at least profess to we dont particularly have more empirical reason to believe that humans are conscious than that gorillas are conscious sure you can come up with arbitrary tests but then those turn out to be precisely the tests that llms pass easily and nowadays i expect that far more educated people believe gorillas are conscious than that llms are go back a century though and youd find a very different situation and thats not as much because weve learned more facts about primate cognition as it is that the politics of animal welfare have dramatically changed i dont have high hopes for the metasituation changing right now its not socially acceptable among educated people to profess that llms are conscious that may or may not change in the future completely independently of whether future ai is actually conscious whichever answer is in vogue it will be so vehemently in vogue because of its ethical implications that it will be nearly impossible for most people to think critically about it,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZd0hfc3ZvcjY2NjFUb0drZlcxTzZMWnVIOWJ5QjVmVVBNNVFFSGx3YmFxNmFTZVgzRVQycDVIWlphRjdCeDZXNG93VUtVWWxoTFV4TXJEeDVSM3ZGV2c9PQ==

as someone who has experience in the field i can tell you that llms are most certainly not conscious if you define consciousness and something being self aware or having an egosense of self i think that we are very close to having something like that but llms just dont have any capacity for that you would need a very different architecture they are simply very good association machines that select the next best word in a sequence so if you query an llm with questions that would require answers that make it seem conscious its going to seem conscious this is a phenomena of language not consciousness these are two separate concepts i actually think that creating a conscious ai might be relatively easy if we try yo mimic the human brain more closely and some research groups are trying to do this basicallytheres one in australia forget the name,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRlo4c3lkYW5EaEdCeXhnYTZSSHRXdm1iZUZvSW14aFJKUi1WUktwV1V3U0hBXzJlUTZqVXMyanVQOU1CQUo5TXBhRHREaW9zRGd6b3BpdFFLbGpDQVcwNDZBdzM3RG8wc05KZ1VJY3lEZkk9

i think part of the entertainment of reddit is knowing you are affecting another person with your posts or comments or even just votes youre not just being entertained by reddit like a movie which is oneway youre participating along with other participants so if i knew that it lacked that then it could never be more entertaining if i didnt know then i probably would be sucked in i personally dont care who produced the art i consume i believe in death of the author if romeo and juliet was created by shakespeare or a thousand monkeys with typewriters it would still affect me the same way but i also acknowledge that the way a piece of art is created often ends up shaping the final product you might not be able to tell between human produced movies or reddit comments and ai produced alternatives in the future but an ai heavy industry or subreddit will still feel different to one that isnt just because of the influences that would creep in not even necessarily better or worse just different,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQnh0Y0dHTnRRUjhQdEFFT3VOSkEyR09JUXlGNjlhRkMxa0MxOHVNR0pFN19mYnFvaVkxZl9oY2daQmpTZVQxYjBmY2EybmlPMGhPNFJob0ZPSjk3R2c9PQ==

what claude has to say about it this is an intriguing question that touches on several important aspects of ai development and the path towards potential agi artificial general intelligence lets break it down <number> turnbased systems and agi its an open question whether turnbased systems alone can lead to agi youre right that humans dont operate in a strictly turnbased manner however its worth noting that current ai systems even when not actively responding can maintain context and think about previous interactions the key limitation is that they dont autonomously pursue goals or generate new thoughts without external prompting <number> continuous processing some ai research is indeed moving towards more continuous processing models for example there are ai systems designed to run continuously monitoring data streams and making decisions in realtime these arent typically the conversational ai models we interact with but they represent a step towards more humanlike continuous cognition <number> safety considerations you make a good point about the safety implications of turnbased systems the lack of autonomous action between turns does provide a layer of control and predictability that could be valuable from a safety perspective <number> multiinstance ai conversations the idea of having multiple instances of an ai system converse with itself is fascinating and has been explored to some degree in ai research this approach is sometimes called selfplay or multiagent learning and has been used successfully in areas like gameplaying ai eg alphago zero <number> hive mind and collective intelligence the concept of creating a hive mind through multiple ai instances is intriguing it could potentially lead to emergent behaviors and collective intelligence that surpasses the capabilities of a single instance however it also raises complex questions about coherence consensusbuilding and how to interpret or act on the collective output <number> experimental status while i dont have specific information about largescale experiments of this nature as my knowledge cutoff is april <number> its likely that researchers with access to advanced ai systems have explored similar concepts the results of such experiments if conducted might not be publicly available due to the sensitive nature of cuttingedge ai research <number> challenges and considerations implementing such a system would face several challenges including ensuring diversity of thought while maintaining coherence managing computational resources for largescale multiinstance interactions interpreting and acting on collective decisions ethical considerations of creating a potentially selfimproving ai system in conclusion while turnbased systems have limitations they dont necessarily preclude the development of agi the ideas youve proposed about multiinstance ai interactions and collective intelligence are thoughtprovoking and could potentially contribute to advancements in ai capabilities however the path to agi is likely to involve a combination of different approaches including both turnbased and continuous processing models as well as innovations we havent yet conceived,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeUhFakxXYXRzTmhsanBOWVNGRDFHeUxCUVJGYTZHS0RTWW5VVW9DeWN2Y2hmaG4ycy14MDNVR2poQVlLMHZzUndCNXlmZVpqMlJDSS04YzBpZ3N6bkE9PQ==

yeeaaah i called bs on this the moment it came out why would i have to spend months developing my own framework in order to be super specific about agentic pipelines if i could let the llm figure it all out by itself take it from a seasoned developer if you see ai do something breaking that shocks the entire industry it is usually totally useless in production creating entire applications from <number> prompt is totally useless as well you could say oh but we can be more specific about what we want and give the ai all the details but in reality it will miss a lot of things then and just do its own thing that nobody wanted needle in the haystack problem the only way to make real production ready stuff with ai today is by programmatically constraining it as much as possible and focussing on letting it replace predefined bits and pieces in existing pipelines where you would have needed human interventionintelligence and possibly combining multiple agents in a very constrained way,r/artificial,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbnllaEhzbkRvLVRVZkJQOUx1UTNVcUhKYkRzaFBHWFhFT2xOS24wU1NlRnJSako0WkxtU0JzTEZTZE5zWTVBSHE0aU00ZnRLUTMtZjcwSlZmakVxVlg5dU41WWZPdnE0NXJwMWJuM3VNaHc9
