because modi announced at the beginning of the conflict that india cant afford to do anything thats not the very best deal it can get for its people their hands are kind of tied about it so the us has decided to keep working with the neutral poor country thats stuck between a rock and a hard place vs making an enemyopponent of the most populous country in the world also because they buy our military equipment iirc china does not,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVkpZMGhPM1RhdUc3ckplYndrR21xblRfT3V0d0pMblpWMEdBcmF1TkU1Q1VxREl1ZVN5b004eEtpTnFMbnMwQXkwOWIxUWpKSWU4VEg0cWtQazZwa1E9PQ==

a lot of democrats are not clinging to biden the most important bit is that biden has over <number> of the pledged delegates set for the convention in the primary we just had so democrats that feel he should step aside need to convince him to step aside so that he will release his delegates to someone else that someone else would almost certainly be vice president harris for a number of reasons but most relevantly as shes the only other potential replacement who has legal access to the millions of dollars raised by the biden campaign for the election,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVV8wOWNiS2JCbUNjdzVHc0NOdzI0MlpFSS0zNEU5TDdybFZEV3pNUlk0WkZZNXZkOERlRFBmWTVQTVhiZnJEbHRmLTdYY1gwRDBvbkkzbkNUbU9nSEE9PQ==
i believe its a multi layered answer <number> biden still has a right to run if he doesnt step aside of his own free will they cannot force him he was winning his primaries albeit against nobodies handily nobody serious stepped up to run against him so why would he step down forcing him out somehow could be a very bad look for the dnc and majorly backfire on them <number> a year + ago it probably wouldnt have been so bad the main issue currently is the timing we are <number> months away from election day thats not a lot of time to mount a nationwide campaign for president yes a large contingent will vote strictly against trump but there are a ton of moderatecentristindependent voters who do sit on the fence and <number> months may not be enough time to win them over <number> most polls that i have seen show that no other potential candidates poll better than biden does anyway though whitmer and buttigieg do seem to perform better in key swing states to make those races more interesting,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUGFQbGk5clB2YnplZnV0SWZFMHEwenR2djd6aU41SGdWN1puaG91QnBZZ2VITkRWMXBuV2dKUWxreEdKU0otRV81cnI5WlhtVW05QXVJRzd3MXN4NXc9PQ==
i dont agree with all of these but here are the common arguments against <number> its anti democratic biden did win all of the democratic primaries atleast partly because no other significant democrats ran against him <number> it is uncertain this would be an unprecedented change no party has changed its candidate this late in the election cycle and there isnt a clear process for it <number> who is the replacement switching now there isnt a slam dunk replacement harris would be the most likely but people didnt vote for her as the candidate a lot of infighting could occur between the different segments of the democratic party <number> money the biden campaign already has a massive war chest of funds that only it can access and due to campaign finance laws it could not transfer the vast majority of it to a new campaign possibly could to harris as she is part of the current campaign <number> personal at this point there is no mechanism to replace biden unless he chooses to be replaced,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZm1fTDNkcnBjMVY3LU9WdlhxWVdhdFE2ZGFDM0xVRzNjdHhnSllGYjFaQnlsOGdac2RZLXBmbUpVRzFjNWI3dlE2WXA1WVR2YmJQeHUwQkh2eHRiM2c9PQ==

biden cannot be forced not to run hes secured the delegates to win the nomination and they are required to vote for him on the first ballot at the convention unless he releases them the dnc changing the rules at this point to allow them to no longer be pledged to biden would invite lawsuits immediately if biden were convinced to not run the question becomes who is the nominee there would be a substantial party fight at the convention to decide the nominee no potential nominee polls substantially better than biden and as soon as a nominee was chosen the republican party would initiate an all out attack on that individual as well as on the democratic party as a whole for being disorganized corrupt etc the nominee would have about <number> months to gain enough name recognition and trust to win the election candidates usually take years to establish that type of recognition trying to do it in <number> months is virtually impossible in the end it would be a messy fight with a fractured party and <number> months to win an election,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLTZzbnZ6cnhpbmpyRzloUXJKd2VfRm5Na2ZwZGplMWEyX3ZYZ1NBVWpZeDNTMmF0VmVOT3k3dklMdzVLNUlrYXFEQ0gyRFRiRDBjZjMxY01PcF85cUE9PQ==

unless the dems get a new candidate this conversation about biden will be front and center until november every single gaffe no matter how small brings the age issue back into the news cycle the debate turned this race into a referendum on bidens ability to serve which is a race we lose no matter how hard you try it will be impossible to change that narrative when you consider that <number> of voters think hes too old to serve including half of democrats if you truly want to stop trump the only way to win is to turn this race into a choice between the two candidates that is impossible with joe biden as the nominee,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLXY1WkdRUGoyX183MFJmaUtTQUppeHlwZWVZZGRGNXBrQVd3aHNqaF9idjNMRmU5dkxpU0loUGZNVFBKQ2xwUFFZUHZpby1KMGVkZV9oX1V0UjBiUmd1N3N2UDFFbF9ZbHJzYkhnalBvUWM9

i think setting a precedent that the delegates can toss out the results of a primary because they felt they could in all good conscience would irreparably damage the legitimacy of the nominating contest things would have to be truly dire for the democratic party to take that unrevokable step besides i find it unlikely that delegates that voluntarily chose to be pledged to biden would back anyone other than biden or the person he designated as his successor harris,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMERValhkTmFLZEFUcGVYMGEyYXh1MmVYRFdqRnRyOVJSNWI1dE9CSU8wTnNMaGxrOU5EeURwbmFzQklsbzVaTWxQaUpySmpMYldlSmVxZUNmLUduUHc9PQ==
a few reasons as much as it sounds like anyone would do better against trump compared to biden trump actually does better against everyone else the only person who gives him trouble in the polls is biden trump beats people like harris whitmer newsom pete etc in polls biden and trump are about even trump beats basically everyone else in the polls the only logical candidate besides biden harris actually does worse in the polls think about how embarrassing it would be if dems said yup were switching out biden thats after supporting him for a year and a half thats basically admitting you messed up thats a guaranteed loss for the dems depending on the timing of the replacement if its after september its after early voting has already started in some states what do you do with all those printed ballots that say biden on them what are you going to do when someone sues their state when they want to vote for biden but hes no longer on the ticket but hes still on their ballot millions of americans have already voted for biden in the primaries do we just tell them their vote doesnt matter anymore the public already has a bad perception of the dnc after basically blackballing all candidates in <number> in favor of hillary this would look like more meddling who is going to get the money from fundraising you cant just magically transfer funds from one person to another its not a bank account and most importantly you have to ask biden before you replace him what would happen if democrats replaced him and he found out through the papers or didnt have a say why not ask him first do you want to drop out and then if he says no then say we really want you to drop out you cant just replace someone just because you want to,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWHI3ZEN6WER6ckZWQlpFQTlYcDVGaUFWTURhMkFRQ1hjbFk5NlF3NEFHbjdXWTU4RnZ3cjdjMFk5NG9uMTU5aWYycXZGZWJRVVJycngzWjJna2p0ZHc9PQ==

others have had a different take and they are not completely wrong my take biden has a bit of a stutter and he will often make impulsive comments to the press that hurt him later this has always been true trump is a bad candidate for a lot of reasons the people surroundingsupporting biden have tried to limit bidens exposure to unscripted press to let donald keep saying things that damage his campaign their thoughts we will win if we can keep the focus on trump since the debate for the first time in <number> years the media isnt focusing on trump talking about replacing biden is keeping the focus off trump actually replacing biden will keep the focus off trump even longer this goes against the entire campaign strategy of the biden supporters so they see it as a losing strategy this is why not only do they not want to replace biden they want everyone and the press to stop talking about it edit i and many others think not only it wouldnt be a big deal it would be a great thing for the democratic party by proving that the democrats care more about running a good candidate than being a cult supporting one man like a fascist government,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUm9QVElHWDhlZjhxY2swSGh1VG5USDFIdXpFTnVSbDZEMi13YzFVd3B1cFRHZFp4cnRZSE1maWpNZTdWdVRpTFlpS1oybjBNSTVPRUw5TzNmdlB4OXc9PQ==

i think the loudest voices against biden arent coming from the democrats the first time he should have run the dnc put all of their support behind hillary we see how well that turned out the worstcase scenario is he runs gets reelected takes the oath and resigns shortly after then harris will assume the office while she would have the financial backing the fact that shed have trouble is because she is a female person of color she has spent the last year drumming support for biden who fits the look of a president an old white guy if biden resigns after taking office harris will have <number> years to drum up support for herself and shell need it look at how obama got the support of minorities when he ran in <number> he needed it in <number> running against romney who was suddenly embraced by the evangelical christians iirc billy graham removed the pages from his website which denounced the mormon church shell face the same bigotry that obama did,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeHQtbFFZZEJqUENkZDBBUC1nSXJuSkx0ZUpQckZCMV9yeDZ4cDlMbFE1WVpWd2dWRkJ5SWFMRmtvekdoWmhCQjBqN3hKbWwzYnZKakhyY3lpUjNnM3c9PQ==
i dont necessarily agree with all of these but these are the arguments biden won the primary contests which is the way we choose our nominees that means itd be very hard to oust him without his cooperation and he doesnt want to drop there are probably ways it could be engineered but all of them would be controversial among voters and youd probably lose more than youd pick up the main reason we use primaries to determine who the nominees are is because it provides a testing ground to see how their popularity will hold up through a campaign see what attacks theyll face see how voters respond to attacks etc if you replace him with somebody who hasnt been through that process its entirely possible that they might be popular with voters now but that once they replace biden they would lose popularity in response to effective attack ads or scandals that pop up bidens weaknesses are at least baked inpredictablehes not going to lose a whole lot more voters than he already has everybody else who realistically could replace him polls similarly or worse to him the only person who could truly realistically replace him is vice president harris because our campaign finance laws make it complicated to transfer the campaign funds to anyone else she has her own complications with electability already for example the us has never elected a woman president this is getting into the nitty gritty of things but to try to explain it to a nonamerican because of the way america selects its president there are certain states that matter more than others the three that are mustwin for the democrats are three midwestern states where a moderate white male candidate would likely do better than a black woman thats perceived to be very liberal in <number> these states swung hard for trumpagainst clinton bidens not really in an unrecoverable positionhes down about <number><number> in the polls thats not really a position where you normally consider replacing your candidate if he was down <number> or something that idea would make more sense changing a candidate late in the game like this conveys weaknesspanic and voters dont like that the only two times a party has changed their ticket like that they lost in landslides anyway the democrats changed their president in <number> and their vp in <number> switching over candidates doesnt mean campaign offices funds workers advertising etc automatically transfer in some ways youd have to be creating a campaign from scratch a few months out from the election you usually have a solid <number><number> years to build a campaign,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTUpRSDlWTWZiVElLd1FiZXdlTUVLeXJ2RGx6N0Q2U28zUHJXY0V0MUtVeVQ1QXBtWUExcWtYODU0eGg1ZXctcnJUS085Ry1xSG5PQXl3MHROM21kTGc9PQ==
no chance is inaccurate but she doesnt poll substantially better than biden polls have biden an average of <number> points down<url> against trump and harris down an average of <number> points<url> so slightly better than biden but still not winning and thats before shes faced any serious attacks her approval ratings<url> are only slightly higher than bidens shes also perceived to be more liberal than biden which would make it harder for her to appeal to the middle and obviously it goes without saying that the us has still never elected a woman president so thats likely to be a hangup for at least some voters too all that said shes definitely younger sharper and more vibrant than biden and would be able to run a much more energetic campaign if thats the main thing voters are worried about shed absolutely provide a contrast,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSXpQLTVlanB1NXdiNkNQdGJWVWl2VFhBTF9QN0xuWVVtZDNJWnBSTHR0ZUZXMEU4MThyeUZxeDdzOERQTkFNdWJSUTYwSm5iaTVMN3NCdkd5ZHZDNFE9PQ==

and yet somehow this is still preferable to sitting around waiting on biden to stroke out on national tv during a speech or debate you do realize that if everyone tries to move forward acting like nothing to see here and he glitches out again like he did at the debate thats it its game over trump will be the president if the dems are going down might as well go down swinging,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYd0N1THctdmZ3ekRoNjdUcnQtVVNZUmxSdWRMS2JkMTI3RzhHbkRfMmhHRGNWc1oySDJfZmgwWUxHcWc0azAyeWFlb3pNc1d2YU96U2FMU1hNeHp1VWdhd1FzcGR3SmdYMW5UNWZIQmhMTWs9
this is all just such handwringing nonsense replace the mentally failing candidate and move the hell on the american people will reward the dems for being rational i swear i think a lot of these comments are right wingers trying to prop up biden because hell be the easiest for trump to beat,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdEhXOEZLV19xaXNhRVE3UTZiMExGWEpkOEdvNjg1QlhZbUNXbHVQeUhLNVVHQ1ZMUnVRVVBtT0pmbWxLaThKcWlBUE0wbkVRalpwRG1tN1BtcXc3TjY0ZjBENjhGbmp0elVsVUExTmFBRXc9
while i understand where you are coming from the reality is there was a primary and he did win and pledged delegates are bound the two most likely and reasonable options for biden not being the nominee are he drops out voluntarily or he is removed from the presidency using th amendment the idea that the convention becomes contested is fantasyland,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbm51Vzh5WVI3cG9zTjRkTTBMNjcwZ2lQeWFlUXV1cFlkS1hiSkp4OGZlaU0yRGRqYm1QaUtHaTZJVUhWeDFxTUZwQlpaSGNLZlJlNUFvbG9xT1hfTEE9PQ==

because the guy could probably still win even with the bad debate performance and the gaffes since the polls just dont show the debate and aftermath were knockout blows to biden also theres the worry about what happens next from my reading of the major comments from democratic insiders and loyalists it doesnt seem like there would be an automatic promotion of kamala harris to the top of the ticket so much of the commentary simply leaves her out and says three or four other candidates should be in the running for bidens convention delegates this risks alienating the black vote and the womens vote without which the democrats cannot win anything,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTkV6T3lyZmpDV1I2Z2o5TE44R0luOFA4d2pBMU13R3RUU1gxUl9FN0dfRTJxR2R3STdQLVlRaVh2Rk5EYmFUak9oTEtsU25CUmpCLU02T3pUX0p3WWc9PQ==

im not exactly certain they do theres probably some degree of legacy with the standards set by the world rapidly getting rid of their monarchies virtually simultaneously but what constitutes rightwing and leftwing is a lot more enigmatic than people realize like the traditional definitions of conservative vs liberal primarily pertain to only the economy and entirely leave out the sociological and political affects various different countrys version of conservativeliberal take like the us republican party is actually pretty big on big government in all aspects but economic in that they are very happy to deregulate large corporations but heavily regulate their citizens at the request of those corporations where as in my country the conservative party tends to be more traditionally conservative as in they will sit on their hands and let everyone figure it out for themselves until they dont have a choice but to do something,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTGJWc24zcDVhbmxBZ01udlo2ekh3clpJdFdrTWswQlBnTlNET0w0c1YwZzdFMGZfSW9nS294bUY1SF90ejUxSzRBR3UzVWF4OXQzNUlXSlFqNFhWMjQwRmcyRElSa0phU3JwN1JZQy1hTk09

>the issue is that ive had great difficulty in finding unbiased sources to learn from the problem here is that youre never going to find an unbiased source its impossible they do not exist the key is to read something identify in what ways the authors might be biased and then combine those two things with other readings on a subject if you are a little more specific about what you want to learn about this sub can probably point you in the right direction,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT28zMGcyN01mbm9za3ZCWXFveVo2ZWkyZWpvT1hRVU5NZXc2VXZJdWw5M0swV2NndFlMQi1xYXZwMVUxdFUxMEhHVHZvZlVXMFdmY3lPalBnT0Exdnc9PQ==

theres no such thing as an unbiased source if there was most people would just read that just read as much as you can try to understand the authors biases and your own use that to be understanding to be critical of what people say and how you react to it thats probably the best thing you can do that said wiki is usually pretty decent since theres often a bunch of different authors for an article heres the article for social democracy for example <url>,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhOE1jSHFsT0tVSDE5SU92QTduYUhSRHF5QS1QUEpTMndNWjhQelRlXzllQ1E3NzdzbnluX2I0UDkwZjBUUkR1bXQ3anJMbFc0SkdhQXJkYUNCLVAwaHc9PQ==

that legal scholar has no credibility if he has forgotten the plain text of the constitution disallows anyone to be nominated vp who is ineligible to hold the office of president obama is ineligible by simple fact that he is already served two full terms the th amendment reads that no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice president of the united states,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheEZMeXQ4R210dFNycW40eC1ZT0lrNWJmNVRhUTZhcDQ3c0RuRnN0dGZGUjRicndlekt0b09KbmxudWpGc0FrWk52RlM2cExTakE0WHAtS2VZdGZCSHVfazRRV0Fhb3dXQjVvVGxDMkxjWU09

the article you linked is very much not in the mainstream and the wordplay it relies on the nd amendment doesnt say the candidate is ineligible just that they shall not be elected is a little nonsensical saying that a candidate shall not be elected is synonymous with saying theyre ineligible beyond the plain reading of the text if that argument is accepted it makes the nd amendment meaningless the scheme that youre laying out is exactly what the nd amendment was passed to prevent beyond the legal issues and maybe even election certification issues that would cause voters would likely not buy it and finally > the current dynamics of the presidential race require biden to make a bold change if hes to stand a chance in november reports of the campaigns demise have been greatly exaggerated the fundamentals are very probiden which historically offsets the polls which are not great but four months out<url>,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndW1kTUljWGg2OWh2bm5zRFNoclJxU3B0akM3MWRWOTN2YWJycDVQVkhKai0zUk13eDJLaTFBdTlWTTAwdzlBMWpDbFFXQnl0SDZYeGo2bDc2dzRlMlE9PQ==

i was surprised at that oversight and he does address the point the argument he makes is that the constitution says no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice but there is another clause that address the question of eligibility so they treat eligibility age residence and citizenship separate from the prohibition from being elected more than twice not saying i agree with it,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncF9BTkpfd3F5bFEtRllmTjMwczZXM0ctb3MwM2pjWlVKeWZFYi1zc04zNUNWeWt5bXRGdnBNQllSMVBRNVhJcmgyYmVzUk9fb2dSb0NZeHdlUWFuclE9PQ==
