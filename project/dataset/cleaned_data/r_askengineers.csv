this isnt done because of logistics and cost while <number> seems like a lot of cameras realistically they arent going to be enough to cover the area you think they will <number> cameras might be enough to cover a single county in the us but not a big one and they still can miss the aircraft cameras have the same problem as radar they have a maximum sensor size and a focal length which determines how large an object can appear to them but that is opposed by how large the field of view gets to be if youve got your camera set to view a wide section of sky that aircraft <number> miles up m might only register a single pixel at a time on the sensor and thats not even very remotely enough because you cant just identify that something is there you must identify what it is or youll be sending missiles after bugs if you do the reverse and have the camera zoomed in to clearly see objects that are far away now the camera is only seeing a hundredth to a thousandth of its area of coverage and you cant even see the fs following a half mile behind the stealth fighter that serve to eliminate ground launch sites now you can bump up the resolution of those sensors a lot to compensate for the deficiencies of the sensors that come with typical drones but now your sensor alone might cost <cur>k and it and its cooling system weighs lb instead of <number> ounces how many <cur>k drones can your military afford remember you are going to need hundreds just to protect a single military unit because you have to have them far enough out from the unit to detect aircraft before they launch ordinance which they can easily do from doubledigit mile distances while at high altitude oh and youve got to employ someone you both spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and continue to pay about <cur>k a year to monitor those cameras and be the final verification on a good target how many cameras can one person monitor effectively <number> <number> so you need a lot of those as well and well paid techs and a big contract with an aerospace company because offtheshelf dronecamera systems are likely hundreds of years from being effective at what you ask radar systems also have an advantage over cameras in being able to detect distance with a single antenna by noting the time it took the pulse to return to the antenna as the source of data for cameras does not originate at the camera you need two cameras synced together but set a significant distance apart so you can use angle deviation to determine distance the further the distance you want to be able to accurately confirm the further apart you have to set the cameras or the more precise their angle sensors must be and the more accurate their installation must be again you can quickly find yourself at major dod contract levels of cost,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbG1mNUhDcGNvVVJQcENoZ1VWeXJsWTk1SzMyb3Y3S09KUm5wWTA1NG9GeEtLaW5GN0ZSSl9zQXRqeHhIb2VZN1BhSjdyZ2M0a3BhV2lKUGRXNEhyOWc9PQ==

indeed most of the energy from hydrocarbon fuel comes from its hydrogen the carbon backbone is a convenient carrier for the hydrogen plus it adds a bit of energy this is why imo the best idea for what to do with sustainable hydrogen is to capture some carbon from the air make conventional fuel out of the hydrogen it saves all the expense of converting the infrastructure is easier to store just put a carbon capture synfuel plant with every wind farm ship out the fuel you can burn it at night,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVWs4eUYxWFVEcVAwckpOc2dpYUpjWUQzS2dGREJXUFFJTy1sY282ekhwNWRwYzZkckV3ZWc3X0FGeHA0T1pFV2dOQ2FsVTZIcTZtVHdYZU1McmM2cFE9PQ==

if you scale up all dimensions with constant weight then it will have best ld and equivalent glide ratio at a lower speed remember that drag is also a function of velocity drag is the sum of parasite and induced drag and the velocity factors make total drag proportional to v^<number> + v^<number> for constant lift this drag curve has a minimum where ld and glide ratio is at a maximum a heavier aircraft at the same weight need to fly faster for best ld and a lighter aircraft will need to fly slower however this ld max is the same value for all weights even though it occurs at different speeds for different weights the takeaway is that ld is purely geometric and depends solely on the shape of the airframe with dimensional scale and weight determining the speed for ld max sailplanes often carry ballast to achieve a higher glide speed but this doesnt affect the glide ratio the purpose of ballast is to increase speed when lift is strong and higher sink rates are acceptable it will be dumped in the evening when thermals die out and to reduce landing speed a sailplane has a peaky ld curve due to the high aspect ratio wing ld decreases rapidly as speed moves away from best ld a glider with short stubby wings has a flatter ld against velocity and is said to have better penetration meaning that it can fly fast to offset headwinds and sink without so negatively affecting ld the ld curve is called the polar and it is basically fixed for a given airframe increases in weight move it to the right and slightly widen it but they do not increase ld max scaling up the dimensions has the same effect as decreasing weight the polar will shift to the left and narrow slightly however the peak ld will have the same value,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOVN0UU9ydTZlNjhBOGRBbElUSU5WVTVHWkJZMjFfQnBQX2VWdHBTY2dDcUNTaEhmQmhlb1pTMERKUEMyblNaNlQtZ25wZXZlOGZIamk4MDUzOGhfdVE9PQ==

i had a very similar unit to that one in the uk the house i lived in used to be several houses but they knocked some walls down and my house was born probably over a hundred years ago i had a fireplace with a chimney and i thought about using it like you are thinking about using it but i ended up finding a wall that i think used to be a chimney in one of the other houses it had a small rectangular hole in it that i was able to mount my ac exhaust hose to and it worked well but the reason was because it had a good seal if you just put your hose in the chimney some of the hot air might make it out but most of it will just flood the room making it hotter than it would be if you just left the unit off if you really want to vent it out of the chimney you need to find a way to seal off the fireplace and i doubt you can do that without ruining it like caulking a box in it,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb1RHNUhEQm5YTjVGblh4UmMwTGlmNEpBYUZCV1NDR21scG5vV3M0SGtGRkdZUjhXbDRhUUxQS1dOcXN2YTdYdUVRemtaVGFqcUUzb29GaWFZSjc4amc9PQ==

the dual hose unit i used to have was really frustrating because it had vents open to the room in parallel with its intake hose of course that was a much more direct route for air to flow than the hose so while it did pull some air from outside it also pulled a significant amount of air from inside the room that meant that it still ended up making other rooms hotter by drawing outside air in i eventually hacked around this by sealing up the vents with duct tape and putting a duct fan inline with the intake hose to assist it it was a classy setup let me tell you but at least it worked i dont know how to discover this in advance when shopping for one of these it took me years to figure out the design flaw since the only way to tell what theyd done from the outside was to shine a flashlight through the vents and of course none of the reviews for that unit had mentioned it either i assume that they figured nobody would notice and that it would let them use a cheaper quieter condenser fan,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWkNFbFMyelEtalExNGFlcmFwRUZkVFZ6MjBYdGwyb0FKeXUtLW91VVh4cHV3Q3FYLUM5Mld3UnJYNTg4NTJNemxtbTlrSDlEakdQOG9SMmtXZzR6WVE9PQ==

im not an aerospace engineer but i do know that a long low aspect ratio wing ie a bigger wing in fact produces less drag thats why gliders look that way and why comercial airplanes are adding folding wing tips i also know that drag is proportional to the square of speed and more wing area allows for lower speeds but i dont know how a biplane ie two wings compares to a single longer wing so far the only thing i have learned from this post is that the glide ratio might remain constant although im not yet convinced thats true even though the stall speed would decrease,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYTJzbVQ4WVhKak1iamI1cGQ4LU9GZ2JxVXBlVlhINks2ekJPZTMwaFJrWjg2aEFDMTJzVVlfdFEwaU9uZVFqRDlWS1pzVDVqLVBEcVYtOUxmWFJVZ2c9PQ==

i think it would be fun to go in to a dealership and pretend youre deaf you do all communications by writing down numbers thats all you need literally everything those salesmen say is intended to get more money out of you and into them the less they say the better i heard some good advice some years ago which is to fax a number of dealers with a specific make model and trim level and ask them to fax back an offer you throw away the responses that dont have an offer that saves you a lot of time and takes away their opportunity to lie manipulate charm or otherwise sell a car but people dont have faxes anymore,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZd0h6ZFhYTGlNOFNzNm9VM0JvWUhET2N3VEEtYkdQbXF4by1LRDh3Sy13NEJRNmFGYnpCcWNXNlc2UXA3MW1jd3BHb0l0WGxSdG5XX2xlaWg0XzE3NnhlSWVKVmZLLTdheE5LSG4xWWR5a1E9

how long has this vehicle been on floor plan or which vehicle of this type has been on floor plan longest floor plan is a form of credit that dealerships use to get cars onto their lots basically a short term loan the longer a vehicle is on floor plan the more expensive it is to the dealer if you can find a vehicle thats been on floor plan for a while it probably wont be the most popular color or trim level but youll have a better chance to negotiate on price,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVEdCYlR6UlYxYjhFTU8xZ0c4Nmg5M0g5aDdJbVpiZkNEWTZzTV9SRUJJYUhSaXBFLXd4dmIyNXBJQ3pJSU0taGxJUHhsellzaTVoS3hEUEJnN2JUYlE9PQ==

while miliary aircraft are hardened those measures reduce but do not eliminate the potential for damage from e hemp the location of the aircraft relative to the hemp would matter since e dissipates in strength with distance from ground zero also hardening has to be tested periodically because wear and tear can reduce hardness over time and with equipment configuration changes that produce unexpected results unfortunately no one can reliably give you a solid yes or no to this question but it would be likely to survive if not in the area of highest e strength and if weartearmodifications havent weakened the hardening,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOEdTVlRfUWZja1dqOU9fb2ZRc2IybndVbEtKLU9hREgtaGNaaDEwVjQ2WG9VR180a1JueEZRTlJYcXhGWWFyczlxakM2SWo0eU9tU0ZFTTVick53d0E9PQ==

the point of doing a floating shelf or desk with pipes coming out from the wall is to leave it floating with three of the edges out in the air away from any possible means support that gives a certain visual effect in order to achieve that visual effect one uses support methods that are kind of lousy from an engineering point of view but are done with strong enough materials and mounting that it works anyway in your situation you have three edges of the desk along walls so you could use more conventional means of support i would make the new brackets along the ends the primary support and make the support along the back the incidental extra antisag support it probably flexes too much in the middle if you only support it along those three edges so you probably need some reinforcement which could be one or more pipes running underneath i would expect that running those pipes lengthwise would make things easier the mounting points would not have the same severe stress trying to pull out the top screws,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTnFKM2VMSF8tWTJjWlVOalVoaHVCN2JzUkhLSzNVTmNRaVBRYWdyN3NpWHNjNHdubllZdGQ3Z281b2ZsMUJUeWx2Y3JCTHpnN3dQWEJXSFBMa3RFUXc9PQ==

to battery energy storage systems but also to hydroelectric including pumped storage and also to flexible loads scheduled or controlled based on real time grid operation in some cases controlled curtailment of renewables can also make sense it can be cheaper to overbuild the solar and plan to dial it back a bit during peak generation times when there isnt sufficient load rather than buying enough battery energy storage to save all of it for later use as part of this strategy not as the main strategy the nature of the control needed is not all that different from whats needed now fundamentally it doesnt matter much whether the uncontrolled variation is in the load or the source but as more sources become uncontrolled the value put on controllable loads and storage will increase because the people controlling the grid needs something to control,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblNPcmRrcjM3US1SdzFiU1JCdXBWc0lkMkptbHJTTXE2U0VMZlJfTlVPeG03eVBmaDF1eFFqVHcxeDhURjVHeTdJMkJoRFg1RnE2TTBRSExoN2dOSGc9PQ==

if we had an internal reaction engine that would take gas as an input and perform a chemical reaction that would produce liquid as the output at a temperature where the liquid would be liquid that would mean we would generate negative pressure in the cylinder and we could pull the piston in during the power stroke i think it could be a pretty nice twostroke cycle intake and then immediately initiate the reaction and suck the piston back in with no need for a compression stroke first as you approach top dead center you would open an exhaust valve and drain out most of the liquid at the very end of the stroke and then proceed with the intake stroke of course hydrogen wont work for that because the reaction is exothermic and water boils easily enough whats a reaction between gas molecules that creates either a liquid with a very high boiling point or is endothermic such that we arent generating a high temperature certainly that would not make a practical engine but its a fun thought experiment to help op understand what would happen if the reaction created liquid water,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeEZFOVFPelBFUDRzSGZuZG50MGdNRUVUdlNtYVA2Qnp1QVZvX3RlZHJhU194ZzR3eDBZZmhIb2htNjE1WGtlQkRyUGMtVXdnSWc2X09SZlNwRFRXZGc9PQ==

i did a little looking around to try to find endothermic reactions that start with gases none that i found have liquid products but it would probably be possible to make a highly inefficient and impractical engine using something like the suction cycle that i described above but just using the reduction in temperature from the endothermic reaction to lower pressure not a phase change >the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen at a very high temperature to form nitric oxide n + o = no is an endothermic reaction >it occurs in the gas phase deltah change in enthalpy for this reaction is <number> kjmol >another wellknown reaction is the hightemperature decomposition of ammonia into its elementsnitrogen and hydrogenwhich is the reverse reaction of the haber process for the synthesis of ammonia source<url> the first reaction is a side reaction in normal combustion engines that one needs to avoid for emissions reasons but the ammonia reaction is kind of interesting one could imagine a process in which you have two internal reaction engines one running on the suction cycle with hot ammonia gases the input and hydrogen and nitrogen as the output and then the second one a conventional internal combustion engine running on hydrogen and using the waste heat from the latter to heat the incoming ammonia im pretty confident that highly impractical but i think it would be pretty amusing to try to build one,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ0F1Qm5lWXdrMFdQSE5MLXZEU2FFOWFxN1I5ZTR0M2Fzek9oeVA1bklMY05WNDJIY1liUlVJUWFORVZXeHhZWWlJbFVVN1BzdmdKeWpCT212bENSWHc9PQ==

cars really ought to come with a workshop manual or what you refer to as a tech manual but they dont because the dealerships make a significant part of their money on service and repairs the official workshop manual is typically digital these days used to be a physical book or binder and is an expensive subscription service that manufacturers only make available to dealers and approved shops which is why third party manuals also exist but they arent free and are in some cases next to useless due to being out of date or based on a model sold in a different market etc for older cars haynes manuals come in physical book format and are really good they show with pictures and text how to disassemble and repair just about anything on a specific model car for modern stuff haynes have a digital subscription service that goes quite far into the technical details like what voltage you should find on each pin on various systems but unfortunately leaves out the practical details of how to safely disassemble enough to actually reach that pinout to measure anything as a fairly experienced hobby mechanic i found this only moderately useful in chasing electrical gremlins on a modernish citroen,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWkRZMlFMLW9Ld2dCMWRoQmFDR0dOc19pMlJ3UTc1WlVtTXhhcFNqYzNHZG9BaFJqYS1NYzA3eEd6VkF1a0I3QjduYjhFR0h4LWJhT1YtM1FNSDZKcGc9PQ==

imo your possible solution is the way to go just use a dynamic displacement pump or if using a positive displacement have some kind of pressure relief and use a solenoid valve to control your volume dispensed a benefit here is that theres already a ton of purpose designed components because thats generally how things like the water feed for ice makers and drink dispensers work but often without a pump bc theyre operating off of line pressure you can even get rid of the worrying about if the pump provides smooth flow by including in a reservoir of large enough volume doesnt even have to be like a tank could just be larger diameter tubing of sufficient length thats maintained at a pressure thats high enough to ensure uninterrupted flow for some safety factor above the maximum amount that youre intending on flowing size your orifice to give you a flow rate that puts you within the operational speed of the valve you choose and accuracy shouldnt be much of a problem this also reduces complexity of control because it becomes a timing thing if you want to add extra fancy you can check for pressure and fluid presence in the line to have it call forkill the pump this may be necessary considering your requirement of no risk of releasing harmful gases which i assume are present in where youre getting the fluid youre dispensing once you get the numbers sorted it should be pretty trivial to have your + controls go up or down <number> at a time,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNWN4d3JjX1pyV2tmNElYZVpfd2FTczZnLUU3cy0wTTg4TG85cEl5SHlpV0VhZ2QtdGYyTTRHOE40amtLQ1B6R2xUc2Qxa200ZTdqMkJBNWkxQkVxNXc9PQ==

well peristaltic pumps unfortunately are nonexistent to be capable of mls and below eur or even eur and syringe pumps are also too expensive however i will probably diy one in the future a basic variant of it shouldnt be expensive with some pneumatic pistons or weights or whatnot and yeah a pump with an inline flow meter in a closed loop control like a feedback loop between a microcontroller the pump and the flow metersensor would be very accurate however its a bit more complex than id like for starters i wonder if there are any simpler solutions if there arent then ill have to take this idea,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNWhjNVI0TnoyVlVjUkJEVlZkNExFRHRVWkZXX2FNTEJpNmxTckw4VHEzZXhkcDBxN2U5U2RwM3VRbFJWZ1pjRDVTbXRPUTltR0xKakx4blJrNGxRQXc9PQ==

it got better but its still not perfect after the initial pushback from what i mentioned for the requirements for industrial control cabinets they moved to a cal calculation method which ideally was better but the problem was that a lot of vendorscompanies didnt adopt it or implement it correctly so its been revised again the part im talking about was there were hard requirements around acdc voltage ac voltage above a certain voltage it was either like <number> <number> or vac i cant remember would push it into the next category of arc flash requirements dc voltage above vdc i believe was similar on that end so using the metric established in the nfpa e at the time and applying it to a common residential task since you are changing a light bulb if the switch is off but the breaker is on youd still have to suit up regardless of breaker sizetrip speed the nfpa e really needs to change how it looks at voltages and energies in a control cabinet it needs to treat vac on amp or less circuits different than it does vac three phase systems but it doesnt their goal was to try and isolate dc safe areas from vac areas or other higher voltage equipment but the problem that you run into is that vac is used to provide power to the dc power supplies and such along with used for a lot of standard equipment for power including the laptop programing power outlet i eat sleep and breath industrial control cabinets and compliance continues to be a serious struggle,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad3ljdHk4bnptellWa0tfLTllclBodE44QWlISlV0MHlBaGtjN3pzbGlmRkFIcU1RMVJoR3F5YVZHUXFYcVcxaFR2WUdqb295SkpaWnVQZXh1TFRhQ2c9PQ==

sure if there were layers that resisted deforming ie were stiff or created space between the magic punctureproof layer and the person that would help but in that case what does the magic layer add if a material is stiff and hard it generally resists puncturing pretty well on its own but it occurs to me that if a band of punctureresistant nonstretching material were wrapped entirely around somebodys arm say then the tension loads from a bullet strike wouldnt be so localized but rather distributed around the entire band the effect would be enhanced if the band were pretensioned somehow perhaps by expanding foam layered under the layer that would reduce deformation perhaps future armor will look like sets of rings surrounding the trunk and limbs,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRzhQaHFxblZ5cGtuRVlXTE00OXNoaFZpUG8tNWhuRTdXdXJzeEFfcXV0cEZ0WG0xUVhJUy1GNnFiUVYwYVN4RFZVejdvMG1IYmQ0VnhLcnJXYmF6VnBxTnNDTG9WR1A0VFdpTTlyeS01VEU9

>the only reason for using electrical transmissions are for ease of combining prime movers hybrid cars diesel locomotives are the common examples the reasons in these two cases are actually pretty different in diesel locomotives its because the extreme gear reduction needed to start a freight train gets to the point where its easier and more reliable to convert to electric in hybrid cars its to enable operating the engine closer to its peak efficiency point its typical for the average efficiency of the engine over a driving cycle to be about half the efficiency operating at its peak efficiency point thats pathetic and opens an opportunity for a better system even if that system involves more energy conversion steps with losses in each >locked mechanical transmissions have nearzero losses yes and this is why the series only hybrid has not become popular the volt was close to a series hybrid but still have a mode where it could deliver direct power mechanically to the wheels from the engine at highway speed for the free piston idea to be viable we would need the improvements in efficiency from the free piston setup to be counteract the losses inefficiency that are inherent in a series hybrid and while the stuff that you can avoid with a free piston does have losses those are not the dominant losses in an internal combustion engine so the possible improvement is limited,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTUZERkFsRXZJbUlnZ0J5dGk0REFHZlRtZEwwaEdoVGtjOFY2OGd3V1doMUEtVzVMR0VCNjd0UWp2czBQbGFJd2hJQndhaXdoQ2tqZExSeFRzNVRIT0E9PQ==

its a fun concept and could have some advantages but i think that the statement that it gets rid of most of the mechanical losses is exaggerated first of all most of the losses arent actually mechanical losses but are thermal losses and pumping losses the energy required to pump the air through the engine and secondly a lot of the mechanical losses are friction of the piston sliding in the cylinder the other mechanical friction losses you can reduce with ball bearings if you want to but that doesnt apply to the cylinder moving in the piston,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNXBDOTdJcGE2MEFyaTZKX0t1cmU1SGhqSmZiSzFSRVpyWVBVLU5CX2pYM3l5elhINU5NZWNMcVctVERrR3RuQ2MxOWVwQ2lPcWNfbVhsSlFMUzJScWc9PQ==

yes you need to spend energy to make the reaction happen just as for example in a steam engine you have to expand energy to make the physical boiling reaction happen thats not a reason not to call it an engine its a reason to call it an engine unless you want to argue that weve been using the wrong name for steam engines all along but thats just a debate about terminology not engineering we agree that it would be useful for nothing other than demonstrating concepts,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabm1kSzV5OWxybkNGQ3ZYR3FDU0xYWDA5U1FwTDE3QXNQb2E0SFBoU1BCamlvMjU2OU1kRGwyQ2RXVGxldHVYcXV2OVh4OHZEVUh3cldpT0NVMjFZdnc9PQ==

simplest case is an antenna broadcasting power equally in all directions a so called omnidirectional antenna imagine this antenna is at the center of a spherical bubble all of the power broadcast by the antenna has to pass through this bubble if this bubble were a receiving antenna it would capture all the power heres the trouble we cant surround that transmitting antenna with a spherical allencompassing bubble the best we can do is build a receiving antenna with an effective area imagine if instead of a bubble we tried to capture some of that power with a big sheet the amount of power we capture is the product of that sheets area the receiving aperture times the power density whats power density remember the big bubble around the transmitter it has surface area of pir^<number> with r being the distance from the antenna to the bubble surface all of that transmitter power is spread across the surface of the bubble so the power density is power divided by area or ppir^<number> the power you will capture with your receiver is papir^<number> where a is the effective area of your receiving antenna lets run some numbers suppose the transmit power is <number> million watts and you are <number> km away with a <number> m^<number> aperture you will capture a little less than <number> watts one one hundred millionth of what was broadcast the situation can be improved a bit using directional antennas but the rsquared loss is a killer what if we used a laser you ask if the laser is very tightly collimated and the receiving aperture is big enough to cover the entire beam at distance it will spread a bit in principle all of the transmitter power could be captured ignoring transmission loss due to absorption and scattering of the beam between transmitter and receiver,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNzVoS0pRZnlpWklnWDlzT0o0VHZHWnA4c2hjQ0FucF9sX1lzSzlQeGtQWlhpTUltcEowWG1FVXFDQXctVW5yVFZ6eXgwUkxTR1BFS05TSkM1MFVhZWc9PQ==

the word you are missing is stereoscopy or binocular vision using displacement along epipolar lines across multiple viewpoints to estimate depth that is both popular and successful at short ranges in controlled environments but stereo vision is really annoying calibration needs to be ridiculously good and you need stupid resolution and large baselines to get good depth for anything resembling longrange sensing it is actually possible to get depth information from a single camera its not uncommon for things like cell phone apps you can definitely throw machine learning at the problem but it will have weird failure modes the traditional way to do it is called structure from motion sfm which tracks how a camera is moving through space and measures how it changes the image usually with a few key points in each frame you can get a reasonable depth approximation and you can do some form of visual odometry to sort of bootstrap the motion estimation aspect or imus are cheap but bad over longer periods but it does require that the camera moves in reasonably useful ways you can also throw out a light pattern that the camera can see and measure how the pattern gets warped by the scene and use that to estimate depth thats a structured light scanner and that is how the kinect worked not so hot in direct sunlight but it takes oodles less processing and gives a pretty nice depth image just some additional info from a guy who loves sensors and robots,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaalh1cE5ZczdFR01JUjhHLVFIMW9LWFI1MERpTXdPa0s5cTlFempCWDhOQkdMZDhzOEZRRGlIUGtZOFhkeWx5TmJvdTB4bzBaMXpYQlVTZGtCYW9CYVE9PQ==

so this is a shitty situation because customers normally shouldnt get directly involved with an investigation like this you usually go through your insurance company and only if they dont pay what they are supposed to pay or you dont like the treatment they gave you then you get a lawyer involved its usually counterproductive to pursue anything yourself in fact the moment you touched the evidence and modified the battery it became likely any legal case you might have wanted to bring to court would get dismissed automatically because of spoliation of evidence the insurance company is free to use whatever resources they have at their disposal for subrogation if they so choose they can hire an expert to investigate in that case the other side will also hire an expert etc then both experts have to agree to an inspection protocol and the other side has to be in attendance a typical inspection of evidence will have lawyers from both sides and experts from both sides sometimes it gets settled other times goes to court if you are not satisfied with what has happened so far i would immediately talk to a lawyer and cease any further communication with anyone source worked for an expert firm that did some subrogation work,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNab3A0WlE2Y3hpMDVEeXgycDRkN01MbDRxaXVzQk5CYmg4TmFYSG1UenNCLVhiUEZMU3B2MTBuazdNN0NPX2V4Q1dYZXg4YldDSUVMSHZrWmJGVmoyOUE9PQ==
generally speaking larger diameter wheels particularly of the same width suffer less loss from rolling resistance and encountering obstacles on an uneven road surface thats a large part of why road bikes and especially race bikes have trended towards larger thin wheels smaller can help with acceleration trick bikes though that can be made up with gearing wider wheels help with traction on uneven surfaces and ground pressure in soft ones butstreet bikes dont deal with that,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeHNBZXVXd3ZuR3NhcmlJX0RkTGVWdW9XOWREUjN2Q2lpQzhWeDRhenh2TjZSRWhmRHk0cklQLUg0MVFHS2ZkM1RaU3BqNF9qazE1MmYxek4temhRZ1E9PQ==

larger wheels will have more rotational inertia which means they take more energy to get up to a given speed or slow down from a given speed however travelling at a constant speed wheel size wont matter much from a practical perspective,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZGV6Zlk2eXI4UzlYbmNPWElaV21GaDlKZ1J4bENTQXZ2OGRqZjZGR2lYTGRZMG1fdGRqYks0enJnYlFMSXZyelVJRzRnTzFZM1QtU0o1Nng0V2xkTEE9PQ==
because it is not a direct transfer at <number> ft the energy is spread across <number> cubic ft of area at <number> ft it is across <number> cubic ft of air ft distance is <number> cubic ft of area <number> ft is <number> cubic ft of area so a ft by <number> ft receiver in a vacuum at <number> ft away would get <number><number> the amount of power put in to the transmitter this is before we calculate the resistance of the air after all that when you do provide enough power you created a constant emp any electronics not in a faraday cage are destroyed and metal objects become electrified,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa2Mxa3VfeEh5QVdnTVhjNzdqM0JFQmp6LU1GeDBWVDJNbVJWWS1nbkJZUllGVDVrY3BxTXZtTGFtNGZvbnhzNmt5SklGOFZVaC10TW1xZEVrYmtNbnc9PQ==
it seems you are confusing the energy contained in a moving object and the amount of power required to maintain that motion you are kind of on the right track towards figuring out that theres more energy contained in the rotation of a bigger wheel but that isnt particularly important for two reasons firstly there is a lot more energy contained in the forward motion of the frame and your body which can weigh upwards of <number> kg combined than in the rotation of the wheels which weigh a few kg at most so when you are accelerating most of the effort goes towards getting the heavy things moving not the wheels rotating also it turns out that that the size of the wheel cancels out of the formulas all else being equal bigger wheels store more energy for the same rpm but bigger wheels rotate slower for the same forward speed secondly once youre up to speed it doesnt really matter how much energy is stored in the system what matters is how much power you need to keep putting in to keep it moving to maintain constant speed on level ground you have to defeat friction and air resistance friction depends on many factors like how hard or soft your tires are and how welllubed your chain in and the size of the wheel may play a role here but its not clearcut how and how much and in any case air resistance will matter much more at higher speeds and there the size of the tires matters pretty much not at all if youre after formulas heres a summary energy contained in forward motion = mass you + bicycle speed^<number> energy contained in spinning wheels = number of wheels mass wheel speed^<number> number that depends on how much of the mass is in the rim and how much is closer to the hub power lost to friction = speed difficulttocompute factor that mainly depends on the softness of your tires + speed difficulttocompute number that mainly depends on how welllubed things are power lost to air resistance = speed + wind speed^<number> density of the air difficulttocompute factor that depends on how aerodynamic you are extra power needed to go uphill = speed steepness rise over run mass you + bicycle strength of gravity wind speed and steepness can be negative in the last two to account for tailwind and downhill respectively,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX0xmWmRzX29STnVvdE14UzhTeUNpNmp1b3k5cVg0dm1ja0p6WVIzbE1iTldpcU5rSXZLMkQxeWVHd1ZDVDhFTHFRVmh5c2IyaTN2aWdESnBqbXFHeVE9PQ==

my exact thought lol youd be able to drive with a much smaller pack because you recharge whenever necessary even when driving and at the combustion engines peak efficiency so a huge liion pack like in evs would not even be necessary something like relatively smaller lifepo or even a big lead acid pack might suffice with much less environmental impact from manufacturing and a much longer lifespan but im not an expert in this stuff in any way so next to just thinking about things this setup could possibly provide im trying to fish for its downsides another commenter pointed out the biggest drawback of series hybrids is the energy conversion loss so unless the free piston engine provides some big efficiency boosts to compensate for that loss andor we work out better generatorselectric motors theres little to nothing to be gained from it,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNackc2WDVuSkZyZDVpUXZfeVAtdEFHbXpfdzh1aHoySEM1N1dOSWduU3NIbHhvdHQyVjh1V0xmVDR6NzRlRzNXTzR0bVotRkZlREhjby01X3ZPX2lacWc9PQ==

oh wow this is an amazing answer my intuition was always telling me that wheel diameter shouldnt matter as much but theres a crap load of calculators and blog posts why larger diameter wheels are faster than small diameter wheels but they never really disclose why >and in any case air resistance will matter much more at higher speeds and there the size of the tires matters pretty much not at all i saw a chart and post made by schwalbe<url> going more into detail and they pretty much come to the same conclusion as you did going above <number> kmh increases air resistance exponentially its pretty late here but ill definitely dig into those formulas tomorrow thanks,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOTZxWnM1WndNUkhzQ1lsVHhPMm9IU3FYX2k1SDRmMWtqTEJrc21PbHhLTnNTaXNacWtRQURxTE1NelpUZ2g1ZnEyVF9kRmxFMVdWNTRwTWFsbVltSVAtSjdpT3RlUFM0NHRuSHFkU3RSRU09

if you had said with the same size or weight or with the same run time on the fuel they can carry no but without other constraints yes nuclear makes it so they can have a lot more range without refueling and generally in a smaller space but they can and have made many turbine or piston driven ships that size,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadzZSdkR3cTVxUllaeGg2cTZ0T2R2cGZJTndWdnZFY2QxVUhocnBTbmZOazRsQUVJaFZHd3RBbkRya2MwOS1lWC1aVEJ6Z3J3MUZrdmhobGpabDZVaWlVRS1zVHZ4VGdEM2FZNjY4VmJnUTg9

disclosure im a phd battery engineer and worked on building leadacid batteries for over <number> years my interpretation are private and no way legal leadacid batteries in cars ice engine are mostly flooded type where there is excess electrolyte dilute sulfuric acid in the battery at almost all times these batteries are at full or almost full charge soc the electrolyte density specific gravity changes when battery is fully charged or discharged when battery is fully discharged deep discharged it still has a voltage of about <number>v <number>v per cell but the electrolyte density drops close to <number> gcm density of water when it is fully charged it has a density of about <number><number> gcm in these density ranges i can guarantee that the electrolyte is not capable of melting a hole in any material that the car is made out of flooded batteries can have hydrogen gas accumulation during its cycling and that can potentially catch fire if conditions are right but i have only seen one instance of such battery explosion in my <number> year career in lab and that too was a prototype battery with faulty busbar ask them what was the battery acid density and that can tell if battery has any charge i bet if firefighters droused the battery with water and the seal was compromised that test is unreliable since water got mixed with electrolyte and then the density of acid will be lower anyhow i dont expect the battery voltage to be v unless it is shorted if shorted the acid density can still be higher examining the electrodes anode and cathode visually and chemically can tell if the battery was charged or discharged when it was damaged electrodes color changes when it is charged and discharged and so does its chemical composition in charged state negative electrode is metallic lead while positive electrode is lead dioxide in discharged state both electrodes are lead sulfate examination of separator is needed to find short dendrite if shorting happened in my opinion the battery needs to be physically examined by experts and your local distributor is an idiot,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT0FuYkdQdzByY0g1MnQtY2I3RkRnZGtjQlBGZnJXNTFCcmlfOURlWjZaRjZVc1RqR1pkaFZkT1RHczhyUmt0QUhIcmhqekVUbTBoc1dVZHZtMHdnMERFbE5TNUNsYlRSTzBLeW5nUlpMR1E9

briefly sure the reason nuclear carriers are so much faster over long distances is because they have essentially unlimited fuel so they can go full blast for weeks on end conventionally powered ships slow down to conserve fuel horsepower is overrated as a unit of measurement it does matter but it isnt everything theres a lot more to how a ship performs on the water than the bigger number is better,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabl9lQ0VPYi1XV2Z0Xzd4TVNtMDdCTU1rTXh3aVhXRTdTbFZ1MUFuejYxdUw4Uk5UdXRkc2sxaWxCT3V1NXVOWUYtLUpiYVc3QXlUYUtKZHUzSnZ5OXo2b2RoeUtiRmgtNWFYSXFQY0Jlanc9

through my reading lcd is limited by a ms transition time so after hz you are not going to get the right colors in frames although the way around it is to use a superbright backlight and only show the image when you know it is at the correct color this seems really hard from a timing perspective as many gaming monitors try to do this and fail and end up with a nasty motion artifact that makes it worse than not using it from what i read the timing mechanism is finicky and things like ambient temperature and age can affect the timing as well crt already have unequal fade times for rgb so you see trails on motion but it still looks better than anything i have seen,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacl9xUzlRRFFKVjNpT3ItZjFQWE5wSTJpNnlyRXBzcnBGT2tNb1Z1cVczVWp4TS03Mjg2YUQ5Q0RKSlpsUWN0UU1ZWUNVaGVKZGVvcjdSbXFMSWNWQVE9PQ==

its one of my favorite things i ever learned in school<url> looking at a bit of air as it travels out and away from the engine nozzle its pressure is high so it expands and gasses expand away from the exhaust center axis they do this so fast that momentum causes them to over expand effectively creating a vacuum along the exhaust center axis which causes the outwardly traveling exhaust gasses to slow and reverse direction back towards the exhaust center axis when they get there the momentum of their inward velocity causes them to compress even to the point of recombustion or heating to the point of glowing then the cycle repeats i basically just repeated what the person above said but focused more on momentum because thats easier to understand my favorite favorite thing about this if you were to examine a hockeypuck shaped bit of exhaust gas as it travels out and away from the engine nozzle what you see is basically that hockey puck shape bit of exhaust gas going boingoingoingoingoingoing<url> as it travels along,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTk0teDJJTUF5TmM3NDFjLWQxbzZnODF1ZUhQQjRuUTY0WFhyVDJjWHptTGZLQ1Myczg5UnVyQnRSY01rTjVHRExHV2drVkpfTWd1UDZic2ttdGx3NUE9PQ==

crts are only illuminating a point at the time which means they have problems getting to really high resolutions at high refresh rates crts dont have low persistence they are deliberately made with high persistence the inherent blurriness of the electron beam can give you the impression of having a smoothersharper image than you actually do just like for chemical film your brain is filling in the missing information tip for anyone watching movies with a projector adjust focus until you can see the individual pixels then adjust it out of focus just enough so the boundaries between pixels disappear plasma screens for a while were the best you could get the technology can be compared to having one crt per pixel they had better darkness better colors and higher contrast range than anything else out there but they lost out to lcds on price in theory you could get what you ask for in plasma screen but this is no longer a technology in production the best hope for better screen quality in the future is oleds but that is still much more expensive than lcd micro leds may push this even further these technologies have the potential to outshine any other technology out there cost pressure in the consumer market will most likely mean that most screens will not take full advantage of the technology,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa2RzZHRnYU8wMVNLZnZWdDFvNzljUF8xRzhWTjlPSFJpT21SeEpFSEgxa2VBQzBKZGpKX3JqSUZCRFNndG8tTU5VdXIzNkpNSXRFTU9GNlBscjc5cGc9PQ==

yes formation process generates a lot of hydrogen and oxygen and that is a recipe for explosion in fact for a ah automotive battery formation process requires almost x ah input energy battery manufacturers does formation in a very well ventillated area with battery unsealed since the battery loses a lot of water during formation it has to be top off post formation to account for lost electrolyte most of industrial battery tall type are formed separately positive and negative plates formed separately in huge tanks and the actual batteries are assembled with formed plates,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSWpUQzg0M2NMUXE5OG5Yc0RHakZJT3NCbkwtZlZGa3NxWGxGWWItNGM2ZzBQQzY0ZHVkOEN1dHVMX1dLSUMzTkYzQktvelMzTTM0ZXBTcTdQNkhwOWpmM1N2bC1qb0g4c1JYZi1UbnhNZkU9

yes as someone else suggested since there are <number> individual cells in the v battery and you registered a <number>v it is likely that one cell is shorted somehow lead acid batteries are very resilient temperature wise so i dont think c or even <number> or c can do any damage to the battery how old was this battery reason im asking is because electrodes in these batteries expand and contract during cycling and can deform internally and that can cause shorting from edges touching electrodes plates itself are made on a lead grid that can have sharp edges and those can puncture the polyethylene separator to cause the short another way a short can happen is if separator has tiny pinhole where metal dendrite grows during cycling of battery and eventually it will short i still suggest that someone battery manufacturer should carefully evaluate all the individual cells and find the actual issue by careful dissection of the problem cell and check for separator short andor any electrode defect,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT3Q1LURJV3NzXzU0aVNKQWYxTUhOOXhLOVJmVG91QTIwdGhHVXFqWmpvdW1tMGdBb0ZOa2tKOUdMRTBNZjRLdHhKN0FobUFua0hUempBbXBkd3Y2TmJCZ3VwYjQwMU90R3Z4anJ4cGRQMFU9

generally i can see them using led acid due to the poor weight to power so i expect they will stick with current lithium ionpolymer packs but you have to remember the reason the vehicles are being produced which as far as im aware to replace ice vehicles and reduce emissions which these will allow you to do when used for most use cases and charged over night at home and the ice engine on said vehicle is just there to extend the range for when you decide you want to travel a reasonable distancepull a large trailer which most electric vehicles struggle with i expect that are some disadvantages when you start comparing specific systems but the general justification for this is it will be electric around town and at lower speeds so less local emissions in cities and will only really require the generator if you forget to charge it or you do a long distance trip,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZHdXY2Q0b1RyWjNJY1U0WVdvbWpkNEdMUU1oRWF6Z1BqaGMyei1OdVM2MWoyZG55aktSVGZ0MzVtdFBTeE9heUQ2OFF3MTVIQ1doQ3ZDWlZUMmY0QWc9PQ==

it is a reaction sensor you mount the motor assembly to the front of this device so any torque reaction goes through the body of the motor and this device the reason for the coupler is just to extend the shaft out the front so it is actually usable,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMjIyWHlkdkMyZjcxRlJab083U04ya1k0SjlQUUdfMzZrdEt0YWs0b2l3SDFTMGE4V2doOXN6ZmljR1JQcTh5TGpPRmdPSlMya2JCWHY1X1dtZUpQakE9PQ==

i dont see why toyota wouldnt implement a battery tbh free piston generator are supposedly very compact so space wouldnt really be an issue having a reasonable battery pack would allow you to operate the engine at its peak efficiency <number> of the time that its operating at all and whenever turned off you could just drive on the stored power i think the biggest drawback is the energy conversion loss but having no mechanical drivetrain and very few moving parts in the engine itself together with running the engine at peak efficiency <number> of its operational time could outweigh those conversion losses im trying to find out wether or not it can actually do that since the concept seems like it could actually provide some real benefits but next to energy conversion losses i cant really find anything else that screams major flaw with this approach unlike things like the wankel,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOGhjT1EwcjVSWmU3bHNKdEx0ZXVpWEcxY1ZQVTlybmotOEg4YmJzaXNuanNRdk9JbU5tS0pEY09nNFhTd0tub182aWE4ajF0RGY2Q3kzTjg5RTVvS1E9PQ==

how accurate do you need to be motor data is generally pretty good but you could also look into a reaction torque sensor if high accuracy is required they also measure output torque directly and measuring current only gives you motor torque so doesnt account for friction in the gearbox,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacE50RGg1WERvZUpjaW1QUE55YWJRRmxnRThMYXJnNW43ai10a0pqeWN3YjQ4OFVFWXg1WDFfWWNiZmtteUY2Z1FrNlRoVG1HWjdsNDVGMUpYQnJpV2wxZ0ZybmZ3Ri1qUmVWQWJGMUhhOGs9

this sensor doesnt measure the torque in the shaft of the motor it measures the fact that when theres a torque in the shaft there must be an equal and oppose the torque applied to the motor mount normally the motor would be mounted to the mounting plate instead the sensor is placed between the mounting plate and motor the sensor bolts to the motor body with one set of bolts the sensor bolts to the mounting plate with a second set of bolts the reaction torque from the motor has to pass through the sensor in terms of how it works probably strain gauges,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUlhqOWVkT0wwR2NiZDM5NU9DdTRSTzdTclhVelhKT285d1NWQll1WHhHSkduQVM0YVVnTmhLcGlRdEszRDVVRHQ3eGpRU1V4Z2podlhibmFQWHhuemc9PQ==

most of the benefit from the wider low pressure tires isnt really at the wheeltire so im not certain that really counts as rolling resistance maybe it does a fluid filled sack of flesh ie the person riding the bike is actually quite a decent damper and harder tires vibrate the riderdamper more which dissipated energy as heat in their body also people fatigue slower when theyre more comfortable,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN0VCV3NXbkJtbXdDS29mWHV3TERHZ1RTS25MUE8tTDVLMGFRZVcwUjFkOEJPaXJCVDliaW95SVY1aDZMc0tmN1Z0VFF6UnVxVUh0OWM5V2hHcDZEY1E9PQ==

usually its highly uneconomical to run a pump at high flow velocities unless its required by design your pressure losses go up by velocity squared so theres a massive difference between ms or ms he is completly right about keeping it below ms for the piping as a rule of thumb <number> ms is insane if your job is to just generally move fluids around and no other technological reason require high flows your pressure losses are insane and paying way more than you need to emphasis on the piping for pumps in the last decade or two there is a large tendency from pump manufacturers to undersize their nozzles this means cheaper manufacturing costs for them and for the users a <number> required reducer for the piping right after the nozzle to go up a size or two if you dont you are shooting yourself or whoever you design the system for in the foot its okay for the exit nozzle to have a higher velocity such as ms but right after you use reducers to go down below ms generally varieble frequency drive btw and its not a beallendall solution as the ranges it can correct economically is limited you still need to properly select a pump taking the entire system curve into consideration including minor and major losses,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaHlKdUNmUUgwUS1KSjhCY1pkZkJfODl3NUEwLTZzUV9hOU1MblJkeVJvM0hXbFRUTktyNzQ0R1RlMHVzVlFrWkM5X1czTXpUVTh6THJ1TnNMWGJjS0tEUWZ2cy1xQ0EtS0N0UFNnY0l0VTg9

exist nozzle velocity being ms is ok you immedietly use reducers to go up a size or two in the piping to reduce flow rate alternatively you can order pumps with larger nozzles i know grundfos does this depends on your budget and connections to the supplier did you take the system curve into account when sizing this minor and major pressure losses if you have to ask about nozzle velocity my guess is no make sure you do that othersize your selection will be fucked,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNGhTZGJFaGVPck9WMmdMSTh0NERkUWt5SFlFMHliWVZrSnVaVWVFSUJKMUVTVmVvaXlDWVZVa0xHTE5aTnp6VGNfV3R3emc3dm5FN2t6MTJyZno3QUVUaVd2ZzZ0QmJhckN2TzBhaW5PZGM9

you could make each piece have a different conductivity with a simple resistor have a metal ring and a center dot on the board and two metal contacts on the bottom of the chess piece so that a reasonably centered piece will make contact with both ring and center dot which may be probed might be a little sketchy and unreliable when theres corrosion or foreign material but its cheap could improve this by making the metal ring and center dot be grooves for significant metal protrusions on the bottom of pieces to fit into and make excellent contact with no piece balancing issue so long as the resistance range is far and away larger than variance due to contact of pieces this should work,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSE1EY2U0NXIwSVNvalNHQXlEdUQzYkNNOURLNmdwRTlac0hfbWVielJwLXl1R2w0SWdOTl8zOXl5QjhtVl93cjdPdnRtOHJqbk95VV9COFdqZWhNaHc9PQ==

i hate to tell you but very very few people are anything but a name on a headstone maybe if you make some really substantial advances in your field your name stays around for a for a time but eventually youll be name on the headstone the best thing you can do is be a good person good friend good partner and a good parent because those are the people that are going to carry your name with them,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnektQbFY3MHpUNUNnczVzTG14TUhVZEUtR2VhRHQ3U2FhdjMwbk5ncENJMmRDMzY0YVNIS2phT25DemlSNEM5aWdxSVhrNjF5QUI3M1dHamlFNjBTMlE9PQ==

the combined cycle are separate trains to the compressors i did work a long with e turbines single shaft cmw with two compressors hanging off the ass and then a helper mw helper motor on the ass of that were quite cool,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYUdWc21JT0k2UXJ3UUpEclRpVVhDVXlqdXp2aHE2OTVVZk9kRmh6S0hFaVVpRXFUeHFSNEFtU0U2LURBNmpRUG5UTXFpSDFYUUJJWWozdXNkMk9aaWc9PQ==
that would be reasonable for an industrial design my numbers were typical for aeroderivatives,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLW5TMk1OTlp5RkhLZGJEZUhoM1RrRGtaX1ByTE5WT3pxb0loeDNuUkZYWXNUZ1liVWNTTDExUXVfRVRXVHZEb0xXRmptOVc2RjdaODNkUFEzRWFwQ1E9PQ==
thats very true i guess i just grew up thinking i could achieve all my dreams and never really realized until maybe either a year or more ago that that doesnt always happen and requires a lot of work and luck hopefully my headstone is at least a nice material maybe engraved copper would look cool ig,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZlJZQTlUZ3MzUVlFNkEwb3pLamJITnBtbTAzLWdqZ2dCRlQ0d3BiNjF6ODFmQkJnazUzb0swNHVTTS1RX20ybU1sSkVQTXlFaTFkOUNWbUhFQjJzaENlOFctOFFkWFRTNG5hQzVZMUNjSkk9
operating temperature is the principal factor in gas turbine wear and they get hotter during startup than they do at any sustained operating condition,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUHVxTGwwUFN1aW0tQ0NjVHQ4VHRnN21IdmpHSFRMYWFrS01nQ2xyVTdXWUxWU2NhQTd5Tlh3M3FFT1MxeE9tVmRyX3VJU04xQkxQMGNTMkxGUVNlZkE9PQ==
and the lead times for deployment or repair there are lots of places to get electric motors contactors breakers plcs vfds etc where do you go to pick up a gas turbine to run the assembly line chain when it reaches eos take it down for rebuild keep a spare on hand get a rebuilt exchange with a core it would require a monumental shift in the management of industrial power its not something that you could practically implement at just a single plant site a possible single plant option might be some universal steam turbine engine that could be used anywhere and a central boiler to power them some industries actually have a centralized air compressor with lots of pneumatic actuators but for long term motion you probably need a turbine engine either way youre just trying to get power distributed over a plant site electricity seems very efficient at that and electric motors and controls are available just about everywhere,r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNjNCRWJ6WDBlNnJTTDBGb0dWSXVHaXZvSTlkSmNLZnRrY3dlS05iV200VXRMUVc4MTBua1pseVlTeVF2c3lUY0VQYjNJRllzUEF3Mjh2eTJXeFRWMnc9PQ==
