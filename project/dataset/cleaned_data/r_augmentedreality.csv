hi at the moment its not possible for clickable hotspot interactions from my understanding the reason is so that youll be able to have the experience across multiple brands and ages of mobile devices and to make the file much lighter size wise from my own experience testing other platforms that allow such interactions it seems that each interaction is actually a duplicate of the scene with one thing changed so each tap will quickly swap out one scene for another but then you end up with a massive file that gets streamed to the user slowing things down its also computational pretty heavy so if youre using an older phone the experience will not be smooth which could frustrate the user and then you lose their concentration if i was to showcase a vehicle then i would have one door open so the user can peak in there you can also have floating info boards with extra information all in d keep it simple you really dont need full interaction because for most people just seeing something in ar is awesome enough you dont want to overload their brain remember that worldcast doesnt focus on having all the bling that one could get by writing your own app because they try to reach a broader audience that might not have the best or latest phone not to mention the pain of having to write and app for both iphone and android good luck with your project and remember to think outside and around the box because thats where the fun lies in creating ar content  shout if you need any help,r/augmentedreality,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXemtyd3RiczFLTFp5VFVucXBOcENPRzVEYUh6UmdnV3VPY0drcnZVbmxNZFk0V0pXUFdUWjVzalpnRERQWUVFUHF0M2Y1eFNiUmlRVXE3ZWgycE5TRmc9PQ==

thanks <number> i had a little sign printed up but that did a shitty job of grabbing attention because my art is like insanely maximalist in content and color and there were a few dozen illustrations hanging so i just said hey if youre interested in playing with an experimental animation thing check this out <number> it definitely pushed a couple people from interested to definitely buying i didnt try to sell the ar experience as a service <number> i did book a booth the organizers for this maker market do lots of them in my area and are refreshingly open about how to apply which is absolutely not the case for most markets honestly most of the time its best to just ask vendors at events how they got hooked up and theyll happily give you some leads ive noticed that most maker markets dont even advertise until they are full which is pretty gatekeepy whether or not thats the intention the organizers i work with are very much in the new wave of craft fairs and encourage applying openly always have their own booth to advertise future events have live music just overall making sure everyone has a good time and great experience in general most organizers that do more than one event a year will keep you in the loop as soon as youre on their email list,r/augmentedreality,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT3FaNURmRElyVTFEbmU1VFE4cmZGVEMzX05qakItMXVxbnFaYl9nMlF4cUwzUEpzOGxBR3V6QllsX3ZLTDc4dy1DcndUcjhqRkV5ZkUxSUdtQzREd1E9PQ==
