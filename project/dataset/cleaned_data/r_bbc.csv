there have been changes in a few systems in the bbc lately and i know there are issues with new starters at the minute did they give you an external phone number that you could call if not keep emailing in my experience once it says the process is complete it means that they have picked a candidate but you should keep on chasing until you get a response i know you probably already have done it but check your spam email too and hope you get good news,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRBc3FNS05fMjZHdE9pQ0xvSXRFRFJ0T3h1OEdOUmZmSl9GVmFLUHR0NFdYb1ptd1JWZWlGU0YyRDJFa3hZVmk2QlhmNm1zUnNZNlFudUQ2OS1aSkYyLW1qSWRtQWpwUUlhU2tmZ25FMkNjVFU9

familiarity and name recognition biden has it harris doesnt yet especially in this country > went back a few weeks and headlines for biden simple biden or something something biden what happens if you go back four or five years though to when biden was a relatively unknown name here in the uk like harris is today give it a couple of months and the bbc will be calling her harris in the headlines,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGROYU10U2RKV2NQdnVxNERfOHVPUnlvRjE5X2ZJQ0dIWnFqX0VkUTVlMjB3LTczTFdDT1NoZWFybTVvRVctRzFNbHBJTnB1THQwY2k4c0ZiZFZSQmRMenc9PQ==

discovery bought the rights to show every event live so the bbc can only show highlights and a limited number of live events this means the bbc has a choice to make between showing more popular sports that might attract more viewers or niche sports where brits might do well to give those athletes their moment as it happens,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyS3VHM29vWXg0dXNWd3drQllXYVVUTGpUSVF6RUw3TnZJZWJhZkFGZk9WcnJkdmNPQURzYWtUdGdQMmxMdHJQX0l4TTNEMlUySnNNZnJTcTZCWHlLbVE9PQ==

the ioc controversially sold the european tv rights to warner brothers the bbc have a deal with warner brothers that allows them to show up to two events live at any one time but only one on broadcast tv the other on the internet theres also a limit to the highlights they can show its rubbish devaluing the olympics and reducing the interest in the whole event,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyY2haUzM2RTdtME8yWFJsOUJjeVBvZ0h0Nk1faElOVVFJcjdRX21xNlhoc0RPZlFBMGQ3V000QUtTeGxDc2hwZVVhODA4dU12UExpazNONWVJTm1fcjh6Y1ZVck9Rb2dFZnR6TFhpVDJReTg9

fully explained on the bbc website <url> essentially the olympics sold the rights as a package for all of europe which obviously the bbc couldnt bid for that discovery deal lasted until <number> for <number> to <number> the ebu which includes the bbc bid against discovery but discovery obviously had loads more money and so ebu ended up getting exactly the same deal as the bbc did with discovery,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyMDdkWk11VXBRV3JTejZtdDdIUEpEM0hBTVBUTUtIclNCRGd5ZTRIcHk4YzVTQUstc1praFgtZGRNRGctc25SUzBrdV9Ob19xUXdjYWFya2Y2S1QtcFE9PQ==

i refuse to give them the money on principle i think all major sporting events should be on free to air tv i used to watch so many sports as a child f olympics football rugby bmx etc and now its all on paid for tv i just dont watch them anymore theyll rue it come a few more generations down the line when majority of people just wont be getting into sports as kids as they dont see it on the tv,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyWjNjeFpudlN2OFJJQ1dlOWwwZW5NNXNQMm9GU29QVk1HUXFWOXpXaFFuZmdWSzJMVXNyaERqR3BTWjZRV3VJY2tqUERMbHdmU0dDeHhDanprZTZqc3c9PQ==
no mate they wont because the world of entertainment is going entirely online now netflix amazon and disney have made it so easy to watch whatever you want whenever you want theres simply no way a government funded body will have pockets deep enough to compete the reason wb have the money to outbid everyone else is because enough people already subscribe youre very much part of a dying breed and you can either get with the programme and pay or go without but dont assume the rest of the world shares your principles as its plainly obvious they dont im not saying youre wrong but thats just the way it is now,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyOW5ZY3hMcFk2MV9vNktKTW41d1AwZ2cxOEdad3VPTVpVWHNPdXVzR0g5b3Iwd241QlprZFprSWdjdDJDTWtVd0hsYlJsUnhyYldMRWZLQkxQWXo5dWc9PQ==

they will people will still pay it for the now but when you have a few generations of youngsters not watching sports on the tv then you stop youngsters becoming involved in those niche sports that takes time to trickle into sports but its going to happen its already happening in film and tv due to streaming,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzY3hPNVZlYndGTlJvWmkwSjd2bDU2R0RtSy1uQWpqVEViQVZoVTh6dzZSOFVJdG91WUJYdEJHd2htb2d0RExOWXpZQTJIbDR5d1dHY1UxZ01aZlpVUWc9PQ==
but they are watching these niche sports on tv theyre just choosing to watch them online these companies are making huge profits and that comes from the sheer volume of people who are prepared to pay so ive no idea where you get the idea that people arent watching i get that theres a whole generation of people who are used to the bbc behemoth being able to buy the rights to every sport but those days are long gone and they wont come back and the product is good honestly you cant beat the disco+ coverage its worth the few quid it costs which lest be fair is less than the cost of a pint or a couple of coffees you get everything and the stuff you miss or clashes is all there to watch later my <number> year old daughter has been hoovering it all up,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzelE0ejRFNlRKVEtSSHk1ZlRsSFZtTG9tNGhGRjNvOEdhM1F0ajlNSW9jeUNJNFlXZDdxbzhJbHVTVmYtY3lrOTBzdmkwaEpiZnBodzJUWVpwUXA4WUE9PQ==

seems better than last time i remember watching <number> hour <number> minutes of bbc <number> in <number> in which zero live sport was shown just replays of the diving gold and medal ceremony repeatedly this year they seem to be much less expert in the studio discussing how the athletes will be feeling and more actual sport which in fairness they did move to in <number> as the event went on saying this i have seen the same adam peaty vt at least <number> times now,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzZ3paVEFfWmx3V1l3aDFaVC11SEgzMk1oZ20tUDktMVpiWjFoMjh6QV9TUTk5Z1ZpMXRwQ0tMRWJtZDhtdHVERnRVUkg0Mzh4X2hnczhIdnV6QTh6S3NvT3VzLXJsN2tnTll3cXA3anhaRG89

i agree that the coverage has been poor and its not just about losing the rights which as others have said was outside their control bbcs coverage spends too long in the studio and not enough time showing live sport too much is shown after its already happened the punditry has been poor at times too such as adlington for the swimming tonight,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzajJBU0s2WmZydjlpdFJuWWczVDZLWWdzWjM0SkN5RVE4MzB5YjFvNm8tU2V0dUpwT1l0N0RFT29pbGdtd3BTb2Z6NWI1bWQwYmd5aWh5Um5Fd25nZlE9PQ==

its two channels broadly the same until a couple of years back it was bbc world news and bbc news for the worldwide and domestic channel respectively world news is funded purely through advertisement as it cannot be funded by the licence fee however budget cuts consolidated the two channels together with opt outs for the worldwide channel at certain times of day breakfast and national news bulletins in the uk for instance at <number> <number> <number> and <number> gmt dont get aired internationally instead a world programme goes out to the world as others have said as well certain breaking news will generate a bespoke channel for either the world or domestic and in the run up to the uk general election they were standalone services again,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1NkhSdXRwS0NMZm1mcl9wSlU5WmVTOWpZR1JZcEVSMlNDYnV1RlQ0RGI2Sm9BX3l6WV9mUVktRWMycHNwem0tNkxoNjdJbG5sektpa1pWbmNvRzdwZGc9PQ==

totally get ya i guess having watched way too many crimecopdetective shows i thought the message was pretty obvious because they tend to follow the same formula the example that sticks in my mind is marcella except in marcella its done way way worse lol different outlooks are part of what makes fiction interesting though so everyone will have different opinions and again fiction can explore multiple outcomes with no consequence i dont think theres one correct answer to how someone would act in that situation in real life let alone the infinite possibilite of fiction however i do know that one can break out of an episode like that just as easily as they went into it it doesnt mean they stay that way forever and it doesnt mean they were always like that before either the logical portion of her came back and said i should be punished most most importantly that i think i left out writing a show isnt the same as thinking every character is good and wholesome the writers arent trying to say abi is correct and we think everyone who kills their baby should be forgiven more like two of these three women can change their course in life but the other cant it was about the contrast of what puts people in prison how certain sentences are fair and the ones that arent fair are put in the same prisons as serious crimes,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBcHFsMWRCVjliaFQxeE9HeHFaTElaUWt6dE81N2pzYnh0aGRNdGFYTmt2MkhWdkc4cERlMjByUUtUcjlCWEFUU2pfTmdTSnBxT2xYcktPU1ZjVVFfU2c9PQ==

many jobs at the bbc are fixed term so loads of people get their first in by starting with a short fixedterm role and once they have a foot in the door moving around the teams and departments until they find an area that suits them fixedterm contracts are always a risk because theres never any guarantee that youll find another role at the end but its the same in most industries i guess dont limit yourself to presenter jobs when youre looking for an in they are few and far between but you can start elsewhere and move across with time with your marketing background you could look at researcher or content roles across a wide range of teams the bbc have an <number><number> scheme that gives permanent staff the chance to spend time from a few months up to a year working across other teams theyre interested in they also have a hot shoes scheme where you can spend a week or two working alongside a team in a completely different area of the bbc if you want to there are quite a few apprenticeship schemes higher degree and masters applications open in autumn <number> for september <number> start dates <url><url> ignore people who say the bbc is elitist or that you have to know someone to stand a chance of getting in it may have been like that in the past but that was never my experience do make sure you read all the latest bbc guidance on completing their job applications they changed the marking criteria not so long ago to try to make it fairer for external candidates but if you dont follow the structure they advise or structure your applications to address key words in the job description your application wont make it through the first sift by hr meaning none of the actual hiring managers will even see your cv before it ends up in the bin tldr dont wait until your perfect bbc presenter role comes up find a job in another department and work your way up across good luck,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhZHZSTng1dEM0NEdfQXFhX1d0N0hRS0llaUttVGVYY3ZOUlR2dkJlNUJEN3o4WDNWd2h2U3dWOWdOOXp0T3VvcEV6TFhLT3FibHBrSjVCSEdMbTd5Nnc9PQ==

if by the desktop you mean a web browser there is nothing to pay and no need to create an account just click on the link for musics live stream and it should play you can if you choose create an account and this will allow you to subscribe and bookmark programmes for the future its not onerous just an email and password i find it helpful to get notifications of new programmes i like a tv license isnt required for bbc sounds so you wont need to answer any questions about that edit if you are at all concerned you can also go to tuneincom search for bbc <number> music and stream from there,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PY21KMEk4MFdRcVpHNzVkS1FERHBUd2diM2kzbF9PMDFYSkFlUHg3NjNPN3NQMl9PUkdhVzFjVlB6M3VmQ0lSenRBSFFWTEZvOUU3V0Q1QTNvX3EtVXc9PQ==

yea i just tried it to verify in my browser before i posted i think my bbc sounds android app requires me to sign in and iplayer in the browser does thats why i added the tuneincom suggestion just in case the op has any problems i think you can also stream it on apple music if you have an account i no longer have an apple music account so cant verify im in the us,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PSnRfQWtzYlltMHBoczR0ZzJ3N2h1a0VwZ2xPMW9nTWE4bDRnRVBwcXM5OFFxZi1sYmp6M1dJYm5QWTJSdU5wbERDTDJDejlXYnZjejVHamV6M0xBcEE9PQ==
in the uk if you have a tv or use bbc iplayer you must by law buy a tv licence the question of whether its worth it or not is irrelevant you either need a licence or you dont when it says free they mean you dont have to pay to subscribe to iplayer like you would netflix etc,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PY1lsR0Y0eVpObi1heEVJQ3NhazFacTV1c0ZPemZnY1l3OHNNRk5PSUlNOGt3Vl9PcFg1eFN0bnUyMjNDenhKRGFRR1hueXFzTjcxOUZRaTFGLWVOclE9PQ==

i tend to agree its pretty misleading to say that content on iplayer is free nowadays it used to be the case but a few years ago things changed and now you need a tv licence to legally access iplayer its a little complicated though because from a technical point of view you dont need a tv licence you can just register for a free bbc account and sign in and watch anything so theres nothing technically preventing you from accessing it for free but from a legal point of view you need a licence,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PdGhqTmxkeFFVVEcyeEx3RDlwcGNycm1ieHpTV2NPZTNCQmFwZk14NDFuT0RtYkdPV01jYXhaM0lkWmRrYUQyaVpfTXBuWW1nYjRSR2xfU3EzMXJGSFJMV0ExZktUc1c3UEROdElocnNFZTQ9

also it may be worth reaching out to the internet archive they preserve a lot of pre internet media and if you talk to a librarian there theyd likely have some knowledge re your question they recently lost a big lawsuit filed by some large publishers so the name of at least one of their librarians is pretty easily available,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0RS1xa3ZTaTZrNUxER3pvMGhqU1VWRHF0TzR5eTBDWmU1eGlfVDRnR3AwODd1dFVidXgxOVludzMwbWM2aUEwcXZ6TFNmbl9DVGpWVEFQQlp0OW5HRml0UEJxRkRWenQ3RG53NVc0Vll2Smc9

i agree that the bbc appears to be obsessed with us politics the intricacies of which the uk public has only a very dim grasp of most americans dont pay much attention to american foreign policy unless their blood and treasure is being wasted in overseas wars they are far more focused on domestic issues in particular the economy weve already had four years of trump in office and aside from his very different style in the end not much changed as far as the rest of the world was concerned nor will it in my opinion should he be elected to a second term in office,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1YnNUX0Q5SFNXVmk2RnRuN25sbUJMXzlvNjJUVVpuWHNWcW9Fd0traUtCRjV6WnFBYjZ4SDBzcnE0c3hBLTZFVkg2V2NUUTMwekxrbThVQTRVUEd5MkE9PQ==
the next us election is massive if trump wins expect withdrawal from nato and ukraine forced to concede lost land to russia huge spike in us inflation and its impact to subsequent changes in interest rates and the global economy potential recession as a result of said economic explosion no further investigation into big tech and the danger to society it poses dire consequences for the environment huge backing of israel like youve never seen and the likelihood of middle east contagion war causing massive numbers of migrants to flee to europe and thats just the beginning but yeah not important newsnight generally isnt for the plebs,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1TGtiX01LcC1FaE9wZzRNcGY2ZGk2TjJZVXBjLW9mNFpRY3JlOHRiMnJpc2lXMHI4ZFdyMzVlU1VMLTJ4SlY4alY1REcybVhGWkFwamVqN0hJaWlvSXc9PQ==

as someone who never listened to it my first question would be as with any station whats the value over and above just listening to something on shuffle with the better shows the host will tie things together draw you into the programme maybe ignite your interest in something beyond the show if its just spa music then whats the point of having it,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1dDUwMFptd19fOEFlYXBYb09LZ2hQRWJ2UktYZnQ2MmNtU3dqNVFLcFlUS0hhaXhDZ2hhWWh1RWtQRzRKY3RkcmFmekhGTkJLUGhkN3JBWFk3ZW5iUGc9PQ==

the bbcs initiative to engage in coproductions exemplified by collaborations like doctor who is a strategic effort to generate increased revenue through commercial avenues this approach aims to mitigate the reliance on funding from the licence fee particularly in light of the recent government decision to freeze the licence fee mandating the bbc to prioritize viewership exclusively thereby producing content solely attractive to advertisers or paying subscribers would result in a significant reduction in programming that caters to minority audiences or unconventional formats not viable on commercial networks the american television model operates in this manner and as a consequence numerous exceptional programs have been prematurely cancelled due to a lack of immediate popularity,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2RmpBQkhlbUMtaGdEX1ZRQkhXOE1zLXpsVWVsNHhLMm5HS3NtOUhJNXFXZjF2RTlvUERwN0h5VzVSbE1aZVQyaHQwTlZTV25kV2lZMGJONWJBRUlhTUE9PQ==

disney partfunds dr who this isnt what the bbc want its because the lisence fee is too low to fund competitive internationalquality programming for news and current affairs funding from other companies could be extremely problematic the bbc should probably be funded directly from the govornments budget as its a powerful media force and valuable public service but for now the lisence fee remains underfunding the bbc is something the previous govornment were very keen on as they didnt like being held to account so often by bbc journalists,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3QWdmS3lwd2VZb3hSSHVYMUZfeC1FWVV6UHRlWHpVS1A5ZHd3M3ZYTFctWW55SEh5YWdWUnZUaWhQVmI5bTZWN0VEOXh5dWhDcm5qbGctTXFUMnhDVUE9PQ==
these two comments are great id also add that coproductions between multiple broadcastersmedia providers is quite common they all chip in some money to make a single show and in return they get the distribution rights in their home market in the case of doctor who bbc is the uk distributor and disney+ distributes it everywhere else the extra money means the bbc can do so much more than they would have been able to do alone and they still get the same outcome as they have always had ie showing doctor who on uk tv other context worth sharing <number> bluey literally the biggest kids show in the world <number> of all viewing on disney+ is cofounded by the bbc and abc australian broadcasting corporation in this case disney are just outright paying for streaming rights rather than coproducing so bbc studios separate legal entity from bbc public service and allowed to turn a profit are making money off disney <number> one not unreasonable comparison for the license fee is the nhs we all pay for it even if we dont use it because then its there for the people that cant afford it eg old people on pension credit in practice the people that cant afford it technically shouldnt be watching but they still get all the benefits of radio the news websiteapp bbc bitesize in schools etc,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RXhBX3FKWEhLdUFEUHpvemVYU1U2Yl9WaW0tTmpiSGJZdUVpUGVXS1VUMnFtV1pPTk9FcTRXVUFvcE5fTGFaQWhNeTdUekJjaWtmRk16VlBPUkI4UHc9PQ==
if the bbc was advertiser funded it would ruin the corporation lets say they ran regular ads like most other tv broadcasters they might advertise brands such as flora cadbury samsung etc what if panoramas research team found that cadbury was involved in a huge scandal they might choose to expose this scandal but cadbury might pull their adverts or bribe them to keep quiet now that important panorama episode wont air also what about things like the shipping forecast hardly anyone listens to that but those who do rely on that information for safety and their business that sort of programme could never work under an advert supported system but it is vital it carries on what about advertising on cbeebies im sure some companies would love the chance to put their brands in front of toddlers to manipulate them when they are most vulnerable just to be clear i dont think the current system is perfect at all making the licence fee a criminal issue feels very wrong and the bbc is definitely not free from potential bribery and influence but the current model at least avoids the influence of brands and corporations which i personally think is a very good thing if there is any reform considered for the bbc it should definitely be free from advertising at any cost on the disney front its really no different than what the bbc has been doing for years disney paid for the rights to show dr who outside the uk that is a deal that has been done many times in the past as a long time dr who fan and a follower of the works of rtd i dont think there was much disney influence in the latest season really maybe some increase in the budget but its very similar to what we saw with his dark materials which was also made by bad wolf studios the only direct thing ive seen was the dr singing a disney song in one episode,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3a1JPQldjQURlZ3dVaVROeUxzU1NuMG5ENHZKc19yXzk3VnpBV3lzLUlLc3laSUFhNTZCcjRfbExXaFlsV0I2bjI0YS1NWVNCc2hjdzVkWnFQU1RaUXc9PQ==

there are many different models of funding public broadcasting in different countries but none of them are free and money is raised via taxes or via licence fees licence fee seems somehow more transparent imho i lived in many countries and i can honestly tell you that bbc is a very special and worth the fee bbc offers so much more for a similar fee as other streaming platforms everything from news many radio stations excellent kids and nature programs and education if there is one fee worth paying in the uk it is a licence fee,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SkhLS2dVRUdrajlTa1NiM24yWUU2T0FtUVFxd2JtTndvOGVObWltU1FYMlJab0FjbjgwN3pDSXlYcWFpVHUzRnlMWmJ3WV9OYVNROExoZm1reVVFOWc9PQ==

bbc news covers local news around the world the bbc news division is still the largest news organisation in the world although its local coverage worldwide has taken a hit since <number> due to government cuts the bbcs us news division is still substantial as us news and specifically us politics affects the whole world not just the usa in regards to us coverage in america yes i think there is a fair bit of interest in us news again especially politics presidential elections specifically are closely followed in the uk and sorry for all the emphasis but with trump in the running and looking like he may torpedo world peace and the rules based order of the modern world its especially important this election thirdly people in europe and the uk are probably more interested in overseas affairs as the are more worldly and travelled people in the us there is enough domestic news that you could just look at us news all day long whereas european news coverage is much more nationalised and therefore there are less stories overall theres also just more cultural integration meaning people in the uk care about things outside their own country,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFZmR0cEhKUnQ3WjFtY1dQUmJEQUt3aFdMZ21jOHlwQWxmb21uRlRkUmtfLXNqdGsxWmNmamlyNmdiVHByQ0Vsa3ZXbUxBeXhZZDFMRUFidEF5TkczZUE9PQ==

i know its been a month but i came here looking for someone else with this issue ive had bbc bookmarked for a long long time and yeah since the website change as a canadian it loads the uk version before switching over to the north american version i switched urls because i found it annoying too usually sites that redirect based on location do it a lot more seamlessly than bbcs it did look glitchy,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXZ0pweWZBTjF3czBOZ0o5djZqdUpOMldqLXhETXlrSklwQ1A0aUFhVFJ3cHNqUnBTWGtJeVZQbWRYN0RtNDRTSTJQWHBVNEVGV2YzYi0xR3NYZTR1SHc9PQ==
the reason i described it as a glitch is because it never happened before and only began after their website redesign its jarring for those of us who had bookmarks saved or when our browsers autofill the url in the <number>+ years ive used bbc as my homepage this has never happened hence why it feels glitchy to some users,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNlVaZFFBTlkwekFyS0l6bXBaeE5oOFM1WEdhOUhjZldDZkE0cTF6Q05SUDktWWdsLWZScFBmRHQ3Rmw3WkVpb3ZqS2NUMmoxSVlYdXpWQTBuc2tkRmc9PQ==

they werent trying to make her seem innocent they were trying to display that she was not okay with killing her child she did ask for help we saw her conveying to her husband that she needed help she asked the nurse for help and was told off it wasnt trying to make the character seem correct but to show that she was in agony inside because she didnt feel like she deserved to grieve she very explicitly agrees with your opinion that she is herself a horrible person who doesnt deserve compassion she never tried to tell anyone she was innocent even while shes finally telling everyone her story she makes it clear that she knows other women cope with worse things and dont kill their kids never once does she defend herself simply tells the story as it happened sure she hoped some people would connect with the loneliness of anger of new motherhood but she wasnt hoping everyone would say oh yeah i get it youre forgiven the other women make it clear as well that they dont forgive her but they wont try to harm her anymore i think they could have delved deeper into that i think this is a topic where most audiences need a looooot of handholding to fully grasp seeing more of the discussion before abi walked in would have been great also i feel like a lot of people are missing one simple thing she didnt kill herself because she felt she deserved to live in pain knowing what she did it wasnt because she felt she deserved better than her child its that she didnt feel she deserved the comfort of death everything that led up to her committing murder was circumstantial the loneliness the being turned away when asking for help this is something that happens in real life no matter what you think of the morality of it its a real thing that women go through constantly asking for help being ignored and then when they snap they are screamed at for supposedly not finding help the point is that no one knows what anyone else is capable of when theyre at their wits end again fiction is a way to explore these things and time explored it okay i think it felt really rushed for all the feelings it wanted to portray you have three women in prison with different childrenrelated problems as the overall theme kelseys ends up happy we dont get to know orlas ultimate outcome but id say shes mid and they left abi hanging at barely surviving,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpaGJVQkxpa1pSWE8tek5zZVlOVDk4XzBmLTNBRy1mekI3T2gzOGlKQjBfZmdSU0Y1NDdwNmllNVN5eWZqT0FJcHpDUWVXeEpQN0lLcnV2RmxhYUdpTUE9PQ==

not in radio specifically but my thoughts would be get into any radio you can as a presenter ideally but maybe just behind the scenes to start whether its local radio hospital radio workplace radio the coop stores for example have their own in house radio station then build up connections and experience,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyeThuWjBWU1pFZU1Vb0J3cUNia1lMNjBKZDJHTzg4LUJTTUhYTWxsQ21iQk5jYVl0WHRENUJaR3BQeW16NzhYdUZPQjZYR19RRlBSS2dHZVp4VEhVeFE9PQ==

consider starting by volunteering at your local hospital radio station as they are frequently in need of volunteers although it is unfortunate that your local community radio station is not currently accepting volunteers it typically serves as an excellent starting point community radio stations often provide opportunities to network with professionals from the bbc and ilr which could potentially lead to opportunities with the bbc many towns now have community radio stations and there are also small independent radio stations as well as internetonly radio stations that may be looking for volunteers explore neighboring towns to identify any stations where you could offer your services while hospital radio can be a valuable starting point gaining experience at your local radio station could be even more beneficial best of luck,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyWjkyYU1sMlNfMFVISFpLWWpGNUVFRW9vdDFDc3lTZW8zWEE5RDhSV19WRkpBcmZrNm03S3hiOVlPTkd0TnRNYm5HVmJjOWswNUNkVHRtb3RUcmtzcnc9PQ==

also once you have some experience in communityhospital etc look out for jobs as a studio managerstudio director it sounds like a daunting job title but its basically working on the technical side of radio jobs come up fairly regularly and often give people a break early in their careers once you are in at the bbc they are pretty good at professional development and if you say that presenting is an ambition they will hopefully help with that,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzS05TTXkydWlRTmp4dUgzSVVyRURVYnBJMi0tQnUtNnFDNUstTGRBXzRMVTN4RmozbjNkZ2ZEZE5tVzhHZXJsSHh6a1NKamoyRVlhMkdJZ0gteDQzN0E9PQ==

find your voice and what youre for stations want presenters with unique voices passion or purpose dont imitate whats already out there or try to be anyone else highquality personal projects podcasts blogs videos are as valuable as professional experience create great content connect with an audience and build a following dont wait for permission volunteer radio is helpful as long as it helps you develop an authentic voice focus on creating standout content that shows who you are and what you bring the table make connections by starting small depending on your interests get in touch with specific local programmes and pitch an idea give them something easy on a plate that adds to their show and also showcases your personality its tough and it takes time take rejection and unanswered emails on the chin presenting is a tough gig opportunities are rare and competitive broadcasting is exhilarating but youll be challenged every step of the way prioritise defining and explaining your uniqueness before knocking on doors when youre ready someone will be proud to give you your first break keep going,r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzVTVkN3ZvS0gzbTJGeHV0RnFHaWxSeW9DM1FmTWRYcWNQNU1EYnI2UGNvcjNRRUdJdzg4Qmt1enNaUGZ3SndmWlZHbzY1OV9zaXN4MEZnc2VpOHpnYk1pVFVHRV93aXlBQzZrdUVSa0g1b3c9
