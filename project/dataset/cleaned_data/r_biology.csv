short answer we dont know for funsieslayman talk we can say were half white or mixed or asian or hispanic etc but realistically speaking none of it pinpoints the genes that we possess in other words we dont have an african gene or an european gene these are all social constructs what we do have are a mulitude of genes working in tandem to give the appearance for those distinct groups of people the genes within this gene pool will consequently yield the same phenotypic characteristics like eye shape and color interocular distance nose shape and size hair color skin color and other facial features because people will marry similar genetics and give rise to children with the same set of characteristics when a person with one set of genes makes babies with a person from a different group of people containing a relatively more different set of genes the two sets will consequently be a mix of both even though some of the characteristics may already be the same and overlap going into a bit more detail there are a few ways genes can take effect pleiotropic traits are when traits of different seemingly unrelated systems in the body are affected by one gene polygenic traits are singular traits eg eye color height etc that are affected by multiple genes so in summary its really hard to say when multiple genes can affect ones eye color,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeGhUZWN2N04yS28zT0t5eUFvelliZEo1Zk9RSFFaWVlRN2pWbWNKZWE4SDYxeEdrMG9QWVk3RGtkVkZURkJjck44aUFKZDFQX3lIQmsyaWVZYzVKSXc9PQ==

any trait is one or mutations i think you mean to say recessive gene a mutation is just referring to the change in the genome that introduced the trait a recessive gene can be passed down through many generations without being expressed its only when someone creates offspring with another individual that carries the recessive gene that the gene becomes expressive both must carry the gene at least recessively someone who is not a carrier that has a child with a red head will not have any children with red hair but the children will all carry the gene recessively this is a little simplified as red hair has some genetic complexities that i dont fully understand but for the most part what i said above applies,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaXNuWEFXd09teE1HWWdDTkpadmNlNkFUVHBsVXNlRkNpdGxjbS1IYVZLcmh2VDVsOU9kYktQUGZYejM5ZTQwQnFPWTVsUzhkR245a0F4cGVmUGd5RUE9PQ==

to find out if a virus was made in a lab scientists look at its dna for unusual patterns that dont normally appear in nature they check if parts of the dna look like theyve been cut and pasted they also see if the viruss family tree has weird branches and use computer programs to spot signs of genetic tinkering they also consider where the virus outbreak happened and if its near any labs that work with similar viruses,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVDh3bE1WeXdwWXRkTjBUck5QYkgtLUN1WENqZU5PNWdKM2ZfdXlMWDI0MlVacUMxY1hSeGhRLVhfQjFsdVVkQ0xyRUpkY19EX3JqbXVZM1gyUUdDRFE9PQ==

i also find it difficult to advice since i dont fully understand the scope of your involvement i am not in a related discipline so as a general advice if you feel that your contribution merits coauthorship i would recommend that you email the pi and in a very polite and friendly way say that you were surprised when you found the paper because you were under the impression that your work would merit coauthorship i am not sure it helps for this particular paper but i think it would make you feel better and it would be an important mark of integrity for the future second when you are involved in research projects lead by others raise the discussion of coauthorship very early preferably before you have done any work this gives you leverage in the discussion and then once a manuscript is being drafted there is no discussion on whether your name should be included i find the concept of long publication lists silly but it kinda does matter to some extent once you start applying for your own funding good luck,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZem93bFIxUEFpTE1aVkp2cTRzYUxhZUhTMC1lcm5OZFBpQWxfa0xhVU1kRk9LTXdpckRIaE83cURBLVg1cU9GNDUxekxEclVHZ0RvOGMxcEpKeVZyTnc9PQ==

its not ideal but also i cant say that its definitely bad your body has a sort of internal clock it produces melatonin to make you fall asleep and cortisol to keep you awake usually at pretty consistent times so sleep is a lot more regulated and these hormones work much better when you have a schedule society doesnt really help with that our bodies differ a lot and arent built for most work schedules we have currently idk how good you feel physically after sleeping like that i know when i had to work different shifts each day it felt terrible but i guess sometimes we have to compromise,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVllkbG80czYyZ29tZ2UxSUJHWmF6OFM1VVc0MVVBaXNrVFpkVEJvbWhOOGVMX3BFWnp6WGFISi1zWnFUMDVHdzVSNXhaMFhpWjZBRDVkUU9Nb05YZXNKaWdKbmg2N2VfNHBmUER4RFFNSU09

the likely answer is survival of the fittest either the first life around changed the environment so abiogenesis becomes harder to doeg because possible resources are snatched away by life before they can get in the right positions for abiogenesis to happen or any abiogenesis quickly and immediately becomes food for existing life no matter what abiogenesis looks like exactly there must be some inbetween stages where life is barely more than a few amino acids hanging out together,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdjFpdi02YkN0SXhTRF9RTUFCcWNtMkxnM0hpMmdpdllOd09GbkVsQW81bEZIRWZ5WHY2QzhGWTBpSm9wZlZTUUVPcHJVRFJ5ek43UDdsMFc2UmJnbWc9PQ==

we undervalue common knowledge and intuition i think strict definitions rarely encompass all aspects of scientific concepts but we have to write something down genetics and evolution is a gradient and individuals are a snapshot of that gradient and every individual is a different snapshot of a different part of that gradient we can intuit that just because a fertile hybrid exists doesnt mean that its parents are the same species because we can look at a lion and a tiger and see their different physiologies and behaviours and histories and know that they are different its broadly a fine definition as it conveys the obvious and intuition can do the rest,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb2JkNlJlSHFleUVNczFWWFJhSEp2Q3ZqRnJ1WGtlZ2J0TjA3dWs3a2hYOWUtZzItcm1udU4ybVluR2dwdk1HaHVJWmlWMlp6MVIzYVc1TldaVmFmQUE9PQ==
the relationship between sexual activity and various health outcomes is complex and not fully understood here are some points based on existing research prostate cancer possibly but evidence is mixed some studies suggest that frequent ejaculation might be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer a study published in the journal european urology found that men who ejaculated more frequently <number> times or more per month had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared to those who ejaculated less frequently source<url> however other studies have found no significant association between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk source<url> cardiovascular disease no clear evidence there is limited direct evidence linking the frequency of sexual activity to cardiovascular disease risk regular sexual activity might be part of a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity stress reduction and social bonding all of which are beneficial for cardiovascular health source erectile dysfunction ed possibly regular sexual activity may help maintain erectile function a study in the american journal of medicine suggested that men who engage in regular sexual activity might have a lower risk of developing ed source weaker immune system no clear evidence there is no strong evidence to suggest that a lack of sexual activity weakens the immune system sexual activity can boost immune function by reducing stress and improving sleep but it is not the sole determinant of immune health source insomnia no clear evidence sexual activity particularly orgasm can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality due to the release of hormones such as oxytocin and prolactin however there is no strong evidence to suggest that lack of sexual activity directly causes insomnia source<url> anxiety and stress possibly sexual activity can reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins and promoting physical and emotional intimacy lack of sexual activity might contribute to higher stress levels but it is not the only factor involved in anxiety and stress source<url> overall while some studies suggest potential health benefits associated with regular sexual activity it is important to consider that sexual activity is just one aspect of overall health other lifestyle factors such as physical activity diet sleep and social connections also play crucial roles in health outcomes,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUF9mUDBpSEYzS0NmYnZ6UXVYbTlnLWpWS0xUYTc2dUwzakoyWWZvc0RrdG9TbGY2UVktUXpzanFVNFQtMzFCNkFYNVhpR0ZtQlllYkRFS1dYTUVBNUE9PQ==

ive also heard the theory that the early organisms were highly unstable so constantly engaged in horizontal gene transfer basically the idea of species didnt exist yet so there could have been many continuous events of abiogenesis and they all just mixed out to one apparent common ancestor by the time things became more stable theres also the interesting question of why all of the life weve observed and certainly all of the big visible life uses only a small subset of organic chemicals like dna and rna when there are many others some of which are even easier to form than the ones that are used it seems to point to our biochemistry being highly deterministic ie this form of life is the only design that actually works,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZlRvcURYTFA2YnM4VHZJcTZNOWNLZlBvZUtwa0lPUFZPSC1RZW5kY0V6M3k4TzNQbW5RZjVudW1TQTZEZ1pNUU96dTFORng1bnRNMVE3UWFSNFRSMVE9PQ==

one argument which has yet to be mentioned is chemical the earth as of <number> billion years ago long before any fossils or other reliable trace material aside from genetic could form is not conducive to any form of life vulnerable to chemical attack this is because oxygen is a very reactive element that actively attacks and degrades carbonbased molecules this probably killed most thenalive organisms on the planet including a large portion of the cyanobacteria that produced the oxygen in the first place we as humans have a wide array of proteins and enzymes that exist for the sole purpose of keeping oxygen from killing us by disrupting cell membranes or damaging dna and we still suffer serious toxicity if we breathe in too much oxygen in medical settings when fat goes rancid or iron rusts that happens because our atmosphere and water contains a large amount of elemental oxygen its something that is so corrosive it shouldnt exist in our atmosphere without photosynthesizing life it would all be turned into co or minerals over relatively short geological timeframes so in addition to the other arguments id raise you that the oxidizing environment of the earth precludes the formation of new life because it wont be chemically stable enough to proliferate before dying,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdkNOQjNZZGtHM3VOYVc4cG83dTZsazJNTFAwOU11N2x3LW5TMUhGa3oyNHhpNmlCUHE2aHBIcVowQjRTZE5PWl9nQ2p3Z2FxVGdUY2hmUEF3aGJGaUE9PQ==

from my own experience and research going to bed early and waking up early seriously helps you gain and maintain balance in your body our species went a lot in front of evolution we share a lot of mechanisms with our ancestors who went to sleep with sunset and got up with sunrise today this is simply impossible because of school work etc but sun exposure is connected in such a crucial way with your pineal gland nerve fibers carry information from your retina part of the eye to the pineal gland which releases melatonin you probably know what it is the sleep hormone which helps you get asleep as soon as theres no sunlight anymore thats why some people say its the third eye the mechanism is still there but its completely fucked because of the way we live and why is this important the pineal gland has a role in regulation of all your hormones via the hypothalamus and the hypophysis scrolling social media blue light exposure bright lights in the room eating before bed etc all harm you but besides that if you establish a routine that consists of going to bed a couple of hrs after sunset for example <number>pm and waking up with or couple of hrs after sunrise <number>am youre basically regulating a mechanism that serves you well i know this is hard to achieve and personally im not there yet but doing this alongside getting <number><number> hrs of sleep can help you improve your mental and physical health significanty good luck and take care,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVzIyX09ZSFFfdTA2YnBWWXRwdXRJZVlyNGw2RDVfdk0wMmdlX29DZXVqWGpaNUNUcVBOdUNTN2tlbFdhdHFoN0ktSjhmMnNMUGFSMGNfSWxZWW1IZ2c9PQ==

oh yeah i was oversimplifying good catch i shouldve hedged my words more than just to say that the typical free diffusion process ie brownian motion explains how many molecules ie not all or even most arrive from the initial location of synthesis to its site of biological function brownian motion is often too simplistic in a complex cellular environment especially an eukaryotic cell and people have observed proteins that diffuse in highly heterogeneous patterns diffusion may of course be limited by the presence of barriers or molecular interactions or due to directed motion or both however to be clear brownian motion models are sometimes the best fits for the observed diffusion pattern of a protein molecules can move in a brownian or nonbrownian fashion eg anomalous diffusion and personally i think in vitro studies have put more emphasis on the former while in vivo studies emphasize the latter and highlight the need to consider other interactions the abundance of other cellular molecules in vivo introduce many competing specific and nonspecific interactions that can affect substantially the physical behavior and biological function of a protein of interest,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYjVlUjZ5a19MNkxJOWxocUR4a3VXb2hXcGpmYTU4ZElDRVJPZ0ZtODI0WUhpeXBCTjB2d29hR2JsVzJXaUdEWjJDdmNhVVF1c19fSlFyYWppTVdSenc9PQ==

the current line of life might be the one that won the evolutionary arms race we see that pattern a lot in nature lots of stuff goes extinct for the things that survive to survive lots of stuff probably evolved and went extinct before the last common ancestor of all life on earth the answer is basically abiogenesis probably did not just happen once though it depends on how you define abiogenesis it was more like a process so saying that it happened once is like saying dinosaurs only happened once they did because we have defined it that way there were plenty of dinosaurlike life forms before dinosaurs for example it therefore stands to reason there might have been many lucalike life forms before luca i am however not a biologist so i might be talking out of my ass here and have no idea how stuff works this is just how i rationalize it,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa0pFTXZxQnZIbVYxUXVvV25SSVZLWG93Mm1EM3hJYWRWZG5mMUwxM21rd0JHRVRtWE5lQWx6ZXh5ZjBacVVXY1pDZl9senNIM2JmTHotRld2Wm9EWEE9PQ==

i recently got glasses for myopia at age <number> probably needed them for <number> years grew up using computers constantly and as much as i hate to admit it what my parents would say about how you would get square eyes from sitting too close to the tv actually had a grain of truth to it when i looked into it the general concept behind myopia comes from a few factors close range vision is difficult for your eyes to achieve and takes a bit of workstrain and your eyes usually stop growing around age <number> ish combine these together and when youre constantly using close range vision it constantly promotes excessive work or strain in your eyes which causes them to continue growing past when they would normally stop into the oval shaped eyes common in myopia the physical shape of the cornea is what focuses light on the retina in a spherical eye this would work with no issues but due to the oval shape of the myopic eye the light isnt focused properly it has nothing to do with your eyes being too weak like some people say and interestingly it seems like quite the opposite you used your eyes so much and they grew too big for their own good this is why laser surgery works because it literally shaves off the oval shaped part of the cornea and makes it more spherical letting it focus light correctly again,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOEdLVmVrd2NNRE9VdEV0cWkwOXpkTWlIVEVKWVlXSHJvOS1RbGdaOEZhOFJUQzRsSDJtd0JjelpRQjdldm9qQ2tfUUdMQk56MHh1UEozNXRpenZTMnc9PQ==

a theory that has lots of attention is ribozime theory where first molecules where rnaprotein complexes able to hold genetic information and replicate them and then dna appeared in my mind there were regions on the planet where the conditions necessary for this kind of molecule to create were optimal and trillions of these proto first biological entities were created on top of that its possible that other kind of abiogenesis pathways were almost impossible to happen so this was the only path for life to occur at the end we know that life must be carbon based that we need water and we even know that genetic codes must be similar of what dnarna is so what i think is life originated from multiple abiogenesis events throughout the planet and these were fairly similar between them,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSktxSG1MLWFwYnF6SEo1YXpZQnVQVHdraFI0SUgyNG1NOUxlZVRwX29aRlAyZ2kxR0YzT3V4QmtHSUhiUjZYX0IzMFRPN2JSYzFvY2R4dDdzRTNpMVE9PQ==

no because another issue is that glucose is not getting into the cells to drive atp production in your given scenario the extreme ketosis will still lead to ketoacidosis glucose must enter the cells hence the need for insulin theoretically perhaps you can eliminate all glucose and just use fructose which enters cells through an insulin independent pathway however the inherent lack of control of fructose uptake and the fact that excess will still be stored as glycogen means that its not perfect insulin is also a cog in general energy balance so i would be hesitant to even consider eliminating insulin supplementation,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac202QUlPUHZaMmJnbjhNeDlSR3RHRkx1cVJHQzRVN0oyN2k4Wl9uMzNQZmRma0V5aE1NNmVlVVQ1Ym1aZjJtRGRpNXUtZ2YzOGtCZHJOcnlZOEFRYWc9PQ==

the body evolved to use insulin to regulate getting sugar into certain cells so yes you need it blood sugar being too high is just a symptom of the true issue that your insulin signaling pathway isnt working properly for some reason remove all the sugar from your blood fine and you wont have hyperglycemia but you still have diabetes your cells still need to import glucose neither type of diabetes is a simple blackandwhite problem that boils down to a low or high amount of sugar present it your blood its that one of your bodys main strategies for controlling the movement of sugar has become deranged diabetes is an issue of insulin as a signaling molecule not being produced in high enough amounts andor the signal not being received at the proper level insulin resistance,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadVljN0hsTTZZZU1fZVVONy15OG56c2lHV1R1REF0WjNNTkk1dVNxN01lLWtaYl92bWxUeEdnNDlaTW9ENkZrU3hLQXZPaDV4Q05nVmJfSXFrd0xCQldaaEFtUjRxc0hLaDFhbThmUGNqNm89

there are a couple of big benefits to being slow first it requires less energy so an organism can eat less or eat a species with low nutritional value and low competition like koalas do and still survive second it acts as a sort of camouflage most predators have vision thats drawn to movement so not moving much can help a creature blend in and avoid being eaten,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa3JmTXJSdndjSDRIdWVrTGxqT2tvWUVsQ0EySWtqUFRoMEdSOTJWakliaV9NVXQ1bkhGNHVZX1hnMml3SXkwR0dYZEEtckJEb1ZtODA0MklHX2RZS3c9PQ==

there doesnt need to be an evolutionary reason for being slow <number> being slow is sufficient to eat and survive long enough and reproduce <number> being faster doesnt benefit them of course we could hypothesise that if snails were faster like the speed of mice they would survive better by being able to avoid predation better but how are snails going to become as fast as mice thats not the kind of evolutionary change that happens in one generation and the incremental speed changes that can slowly result in large changes over millions of years provide absolutely no better chances at surviving and reproducing because their prey is all so much faster than them thus nature does not select for faster snails thus snails do not evolve to be faster,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad2VQVllEX2czRzJ3T0hHTENnWHJxTWJDS2Q1bl81QXFlN19sWEhoRUMtT2NucEVSMjlFWUxoU0NuQ3RLZ19BSVBaR1dKbXVFd2pGaUlhZlhEbHVENXc9PQ==
its also worth noting that evolution is absolutely littered with local optimum states that cant easily adapt to a new niche the respiratory and circulatory systems of birds are absolutely insane for high power output but they wont survive in any niche that starves them all winter many of them must migrate because their energy demands wont allow them to tough out a hard winter maybe a snail could evolve such a circulatory system one day but the niches that would require it are all occupied by birds and mammals that are already better adapted both are way too far from ever being able to do a good job at the others niche,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMEZSM2ZCVXZQcXo1UUhDck5QMHVXV1dlSkVaZkI0OWMxQ2stZkRfWThpV0NiUkxpT0dsR1h2UEVROVNIZWh5WUxNTXJkSHlHVWpqSV95cHVpSTVWcFE9PQ==

in general terms it means an ecological role defined by an organisms environment qualities that can define a niche for a species include the food it eats and where it tends to find it the times it is most active and the predators it is good at avoiding more specifically niches are what organisms compete for survival over when we speak of survival of the fittest what we mean is survival of the organism that is best at occupying a specific niche the reason the concept is important in evolutionary studies is because typically two species cannot share the same niche in the same region for very long the one who is better suited for that particular niche will usually outcompete the other which must either adapt to occupy a different niche or go extinct,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRVVVTG1CeDB3X0Z2bnBQdEpPTk14djZXRDJwZzZvLXBya3RoeThCTnVzTm5qRG5qNFVENkVUMzlwZG4wOENINVpBZ2c2Uk1UNzhHYXRPd1dIeWVIU1E9PQ==

okay but no one is claiming that evolutionary change happens like scrabble letters falling onto a table evolution even what you refer to as macroevolution happens gradually by little tweaks if the little tweaks benefit the organism they are more likely to be passed on to future generations look at the human eye for example if i claimed that there was an evolutionary jump from light sensitive cells on the top of a flatworms head to a complex eye with a retina vitreous lens aqueous cornea and muscles to move it around then you could compare it to winning a lottery with impossibly long odds or dropping scrabble letters on a table and coming up with hamlet however there are examples throughout the animal kingdom of progressively more complex eyes evolution is a gradual process and nothing happens with a flash and a bang it has been my observation that most people who believe in intelligent design or young earth creationism really dont understand the science of evolution and all of the evidence for it the author you quote made a straw man argument against evolution by mischaracterizing it,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUUdyX08tMDBRTEVxWDNETm15NW9OU1JwRkxfSHJHVVBoSlZKZEwyd3dRZ0QwOVI4ek9KNXdYV1dYNWM2TTBWMThPQ0tQdXlUQ3p5WW5rX3dkWHdXQ1E9PQ==

nope and no not always evolution has no agency and doesnt always result in the best way to do something theres also millions traits that are either neutral or sometimes even bad but because the animal doesnt have direct competitionor because it has other better traits that mitigate the effects of the bad traitsthose traits are passed down there isnt always a purpose for things and evolution doesnt choose what we might term optimal in a vacuum whatever is good enough for any particular environment will likely stick around even if it seems bad to you,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNXE0bW1sT2dvY2Mwd0hyeHlCTkltbGgwWnl0M0RJekdZVEdJTVhvOE9ObmZMWFBESy13clk2eTZ6U0JlY2piM3N6M1g2RTVJSFNGZHhnVXFJb2hwYlE9PQ==

generally normal in mammals especially larger ones like other mammals though it is not necessarily healthy for large mammals like humans to have children within the first years of sexual maturity that being said evolutionary pressures tend to prefer a species starts having offspring as soon as possible in terms of human specific traits women also tend to mature mentally and psychologically much faster than men a study done by mark hanson and peter gluckman from the university of southampton suggests it was likely the age at which women could function as mature members of an early prehistoric and paleolithic society as huntergatherers without an unnecessary risk of death due to pregnancy complications for the time males however needed more time to mature physically before they could contribute to their roles in an early homo sapient tribe and so also developed psychologically at a slower pace as well longterm societal pressures as a species essentially as society became more complex the period in which humans considered ourselves psychologically developed enough to function as mature members of the tribe changed obviously our biological functions could not match our rate of psychological cultural and societal development so were left in the awkward predicament where both men and women but especially women reach sexual maturity far before they should as an interesting note chimpanzees have a relatively similar gap in their ages of sexual maturity between male and female members of the species likely for very similar reasons,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLVpOMDZxMndfMkNUNlN0UWJta2lmREdTdnQ2YzJ3dGJYa2dkVzlpYUt0VFA5cGJfc3N3aXJIVFVLOVJlQVN4VlVmSG9GYmRiSk40V0lieml2RkVpM0ZCX25NYVZHRHlVaTNRak51SEpIaXM9

the optimal evolutionary strategy is different for human males and females sexual maturity is always costly and keeping up reproductive potential costs resources for males it is a more beneficial strategy leads to more surviving offspring to use more resources for growing bigger and whatever other development happens while juvenile and obly a bit later start reproduction for females it seems that the fitness benefits from those extra years are not worth it compared to starting maturation and conceiving a bit earlier,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUjhSbk9BSXY5bkFKV2VXc0lzeVlJZlUzaDlGc3hfbGpYWkVlZ3Y4MFgwMHJLTGJpMnR4MGVabm9aLVhpcmRhc2tyZkhNczZBZGlYTVZ4ek5QS2prNkxWTXIwQ3ZzekFpWWxBUHRqMEdCSm89

sexual maturity means that a childs body can produce gametes that are fertile that means boys can produce viable sperm as soon as they start ejaculating thats usually earlier than girls can produce viable ovum so no girls dont mature sexually faster than boys its usually boys that are sexually mature before girls young boys just dont have access to women the same way that older men do that has nothing to do with the state of the boys fertility,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRzBLRzhZYUZ1dzFTQnp4Q3FZRXVFNkstaXljeC1BUzd1N2ljeHlSamx2amhrNHZFWVpjS3ZwVFFEYy1pY1dRdlJ5SFJ0ZWtwa0dtUGhLOE43VTJfQ3c9PQ==

you dont actually enjoy the pain from the spicy food you enjoy the feeling it gives you this is mainly because the sensation of pain causes the release of endorphins which act as natural painkillers endorphins also give you a very good feeling one similar to the feeling one gets from opiates like morphine but much much less pronounced people have different capacities for feeling pleasure from endorphins and different pain thresholds for some the pleasure from the endorphins is much greater than the pain felt while for others that is not the case this is also why masochists exist,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR2I1NHpFSUszWWg1cWVmeFpKbkRLMkZ5Wkl1MEFwcW1lMGcyZF9oS0tXSjZJRHZrcnVLUktKaG9INUQyTlFYQzNnRERvVmZUUUhRejlPcWxFYUVPMUU1TXpJMzExcDJmTUZGMldHZE1vdUU9

because secondary sexual characteristics show later in men than women usually usually emotional maturity and facial ruggedness etc etc doesnt kick in until muscle levels is fairly well developed this is evolutionary believed to be because men can often kill who they view as rivalscompetitors ie what they perceive as other men but far less likely to kill a child this means men who have more time to build their muscle bulk etc before they look like full men are more likely to survive to adulthood as they are more likely to survivewin fights and more strength puts people off from fighting in the first place therefore more likely to have children who survive,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMS1ObUF2RC1FcjA5YXJzYWNJWERxMnBrNUszZWo5dEg2MlNFbjdBNjVEMDhUUHZqeDU5dW9iamNMOXhrenRVTVBWT1NkcHpQODZwbHYzcW9Sb2RZS3c9PQ==

reproductive maturity occuring faster in female at least in humans seems to be tied to the fact that the wierd way oogenesis occurs makes it extremely disadvantageous to wait too long since meiosis in female occurs in almost a suspended state until they ovulate which completes meiosis compared to in msles where they just make a new batch of sperm every day that lets the egg suspended in the middle of meiosis accumulate damage that can mess with oogenesis and result in a faulty egg thats why the age of the mother is a bigger factor in congenital diseases than the age of the father now why this wierd paused meiosis occurs in eggs but not sperm i dont know but i suspect it has to do with eggs having the mitochondria and cytoplasm and sperm not having it another good reason is that female are inherently the one who invests more in reproduction because the egg contains the cytoplasm with mitochondria and it scales upward to pregnancy which is safer and more succesdful the younger the female in mammals reproductively the age of the father does not matter as much as age of the mother because a dad is not as critical as a mom an old father can still impregnate a woman and lead to a successful pregnancy an old lady may fail in health and completely terminate the pregnancy,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS0N5TTU1VFlGVkY3UEtfd0pEOG94UlhDemhPcG5pQzNIT3pVUFpZY2ZyVUU4NTY5U3JHYXhLWWx5MUxxSi1oRUE0cDFuTGJ3NWxNWGp1Q3IyYi1GZlE9PQ==

no one seems to have actually answered the question some are even denying that puberty occurs earlier in females than in males which is deeply concerning given this is a science subreddit yes females begin puberty at around <number> years and males at around <number> years the start of puberty for both males and females is similar the production of gonadal steroids namely testosterone being metabolized into estradiol which stimulates gonadal maturation in both sexes for this process the body requires body fat which females tend to accumulate more of than males with body fat being more readily available to females gonadal maturation can begin earlier and progress more quickly this is also why its common to see females much taller than their male peers in the early teenage years following the onset of gonadal maturation the process diverges substantially in males and females but still tends to progress slower in males nutritional availability has also allowed for earlier onset of puberty compared to centuries past it can also be difficult to assess exactly when puberty onset happened because the first physiological signs of puberty are apparent only sometime later,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVzA2XzVGeW94Y1BvWkZqeWU4cFh2ZE40NWVVaUwyVFdUTWI4eG1MUk85REI4c2Q2Yi1aZzgzZGtVMnBtVkxIVkhSYVRhRUNTaDZ0S3JPazQ2aHU5ME5qSThnU2oyLW9hODZpaXh5UkR5ZjA9

it depends on exactly which chromosome was doubled and which was deleted but in general the sperm and egg wont even mix if the numbers of chromosomes are different its worth knowing also that the vast vast majority of all genetic mutations result in almost immediate spontaneous miscarriage before mom even knows she is pregnant living beings are extremely complex and screwing around with their dna almost always interferes with the delicate balance that allows us to live genetic mutations that actually allow the person to survive even long enough to be born are extremely rare thats why we can list and diagnose them all because virtually all of the astronomically large number of possible mutations result in death before birth,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhOTFPYnc3b21GQVNmRjFfazRFNTdubUlGc0lKNE9mYmgyYXFTTHZmOFlnZTBpOElvYzl4NE9HQm0tWVJaV1ZOZXI2bkZDN2xhVy04dFVybFpkX2ZpUFE9PQ==

at least according to this video why dawkins is wrong | denis noble interview youtubecom<url> his point is actually not that his claims are revolutionary he even said darwin knew about what he is claiming to be the case his claim is that a genetics only model that reduces organisms to genes or to phenotypes that are an expression of genetics is too simplistic and leads us down the wrong track as or more important is the clever utilisation of genes not as coding for how to make a cell body but as part of the whole toolbox that cells bodies use to do what they need to do specifically he is addressing types like dawkins who see an organism as an ensemble of genes first and foremost not saying i agree i dont know enough on the topic to say either way just presenting the argument as best i understand it because it is an interesting idea,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQ2Z1TllpMmx4V21ua3NFQWU1OVJiTHYzeUt2R0ZhMXFiYTJyOXRRaDNMQlhzeVpjNEVGYUQxMkVPLV9OMnpORU9ERm8zSUpOTllCQmxFbVlieHJfUlE9PQ==
