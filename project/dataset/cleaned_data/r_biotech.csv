hi sorry im in desperate need of help and hence reaching out like this since you are at a good pharma company and work in qa can you tell me what degree gets you higher paying jobs in corporate pharmacy msc biotech preceded by bsc hons biochemistry or m pharma and outside pharma does the biotech degree offer greater jobs in the same aspect and just this last bit im really sorry will a btech biotech graduate have more options against msc biotech graduate,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZ29Hd1lSeHB4UndsR1BUVm5nbWtUeVFvYkFsbjNVa3VqMjZzUEJWZ3hweFhrREpsTGpncDRhanF3VHBrUkxXOXlzRXJaVEViSDAtRFhUc3NZQ2ZUb0E9PQ==
in my opinion the best way to express excitement is simply by your voice tone when you are saying this make it sound genuine in addition by researching as much as humanly possible about this company youll be able to land pearls of knowledge about the company which will certainly make it seem like youre passionate about their work in short the best way of showing excitement is genuinely being excited and being yourself,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOS1VcGgwOEJZSGlzaEphWEMtSG9ZVjFBakd1Wkp6NnFzdkpSczFtM25ZQ0Z4ZXllaE1BVUNwcy1uNlpjUDJpdlEyQThpSFF5b0VtZnBzSjJkR05RTS1Mcmw1bDM4M3ZLeW9IYnVLVDhidlE9

hi first of all i really have to say thank you so much for such a detailed answer i truly appreciate it and i know it must have cost you a considerable amount of time initially i was searching for btech biotech colleges for the same reason that the pay will be better and i know a lot of universities in the ncr offer it to students who didnt have maths in high school the reason i voted against it was <number> i will have to work harder for maths and while i can manage that i dont think only managing will suffice i will have to be good at it for better positions at least thats what i had in mind <number> the fees i can afford barely but it is a lot and i wasnt sure if id get a worthy return on that investment placement records werent that great and honestly i have no idea if that improves as career progresses so eventually i proceeded to pharma vs bsc msc and yesterday i had just decided to go with my instinct and pursue bsc but then you replied its for the best no complaints obviously but im again in a dilemma will i really face such a huge cut in jobs with an msc degree what if i pursue mba after it while working somewhere and will pharma with mba yield better jobs also what colleges for b pharm m pharm do you suggest just curious because all i knew were pvt and i wasnt so enthusiastic about that but a degree is a degree thank you so much for the recommendations to enhance my portfolio btw the only boost i was aware with was of publishing a research paper so everything else is a great help oh and yes i dont want to work in labs or continue in research field but thats only because i want to finance and look after my family research wont be the way to go about that everything else you mentioned im on it reading in detail please respond if you can for the above mentioned queries,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRm9fRzRhczc0T0prVmlGQzdvZmNZQk9fWGFMVE9ZeXcxcjlCcjdUTkFFa2s2X0pFMWx6aFlHcm9ZV0M0VW84M3gxdU5CYmtlMHpzOUtyTFZ5Y3UtTkE9PQ==

the only way to progress in biotechpharmalife sciences is to do an ms outside india but you need work exp now more than ever because international sponsorships are hard to come by first bsc then work experience for <number> years and then msc employability after a bsc may will take a hit in the sense that so many domains wont be open to you a starting package for bsc is generally <number> lakhs and even for btech unless its more a mathcompsci filed such as bioinfo where you can bag a <number><number> lakh p a package at an entrylevel so pay cheques may not be that divergent you can do an mba that has nothing to do much with knowledge gained in biotechpharmalife sciences specialised health care mbas in india dont make much of a difference mba outside india needs <number><number> yrs of work experience from a good company constant promotions leadership positions and so on you can get into research later on outside india to move up the ladder in sciency roles you generally need a phd and there are many industry phds as well if you are hellbent on research after undergrad try bagging a role as an ra in european university of course that will only happen if you have done some research internship at that uni before during summer or something it will be hard to continue loving science in india because it doesnt pay and you need math for any and every field today you dont have to be that great at it also learn advanced excel sql tableau spssstata during your last year will be needed on most jobs,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS3dfS1Uyc3V0MzlnVk1DM1VCNWRsaFdxZVJSQ3N6djZGMU5wYW1XVXppZ1ZxYjNaMzhBQndnZVZHUkpOMzNHWDdCUUN2bmRTNXFmXzAwU0RFMHd4ZXJEWi1TX3EtOE5CWmVJMUNHdm15Tlk9

one of my fav subjects was organic chem i really wish i studied biochem and med chem perhaps as an ms though its a bit of a saturated field in the us and in india there are more generic drugs being produced if you love what you studyit wont be that hard but you also have to be pragmatic about it also whichever of the <number> paths you take after life sciences choose wisely you cant switch between one cluster to another you will have to start again at an entrylevel pay unless you do an ms which is why work exp before ms is super important a great way to earn money after undergrad is scientific comms on the side pick one subject that you are a master at epidemiology or whatever you are taught find people on linkedin in that niche find them on nature science science aas blogs read their blogs or newsletters email them that you would like to contribute it could be something like data visualisation interesting info graphics and so on there are great data visualisation courses on coursera often these people will be profs find a redditdiscord community to be in touch with research scholars you can even contact profs on coursera actually whose courses you take thats the easiest way you could also earn money through scientific illustration its like drawing comics but for biochemical processes and stuff do the same thing as above many people need some illustrations for their paper others may need for publishing a science novel find top science writersillustrators from scientific american pop science nyt science and so on look at their work build a portfolio online great way to keep you in touch with sciency stuff and your work actually many edtechs like byjus just dont ever apply there will need your help build a great portfolio first learn animation after drawing dont make these your main jobs because often people with phds switch to science journalism and illustration earn money on the side through this often people who have spent almost a decade or two grinding themselves learning about tech and have a lot of exposure move to switch fields later in their life when they are looking for something creative and relaxed you have to hustle now <number> linkedin <number> india bioscience <number> biotechnika <number> fiercebiotech <number> fierce pharma <number> substack <number> science aasnature <number> coursera <number> mit ocw <number> nptel maybe are your best friends in this journey find comparative websites for pharma as well trust me when there are jobs that dont pay you need to create your own job,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVktsZEVwT2lseFRGUlNidVNTWTl3eUlZdE5zS2lPMkRnYXVrVlJNWlY0cVExYm1EYm13dGF2eHh6aE9oMUFUOFg5emljYXpvODdQc3Y4aXZ2TlppRTh3SGhTQU1hZXNzazdHa3BKN1hnN009

welcome to the industry the most important thing to know about an entry level role is that youre not expected to know everything show a willingness to learn ask questions and dont be afraid to acknowledge that you dont understand how something works or that you need help ive found many times that fresh eyes experienced or not on systemsprocessesproblems can yield improvements or new approaches im assuming this a gmp manufacturing role and if thats the case take data integrity training and documentation very seriously your signature is your word that you checked or performed a task if you see or suspect something is off say something id rather have a nonissue be raised than an actual issue be overlooked take the time to build connections in the different departments itll not only give you insight into other roles that you might want to explore as your career progresses but i also like to have some gotos for quick questions and such youll often hear that this industry is small and as people move on these connections become even more valuable as your network grows best of luck,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ0U5djYxbFlFTW5kTkRjQ0ZMbG15TFQ1WTFKdU1MeWpVLTdRRUQ2c1RzOWdlcXk5bHR0TVprQ09fS1FNMnZmYzRhQ1FSNTFlc2VfSnA1TFl1SHd6R0E9PQ==

i love organic chem it is one of the reasons for my inclination towards biochem i understand about maths not choosing it in th grade is still one of my biggest regrets and yes ms outside india im super aware didnt know about work experience however if i go through bsc or pharma ill need to have work experience and various other skills for my portfolio right got that so entry level salaries for bsc and btech are in the similar range but im assuming btech offers better range as career progresses as per your initial input that an engineering degree makes better does that stand true despite the college i do it from mba yes i wasnt particularly talking about health care mbas but rather a general mba actually research im not that excited about actually i know pay and research dont go hand in hand so industry phds i havent looked into or thought about as much but i will keep this information with me for the years to come thats so true loving science in india part thats a relief to hear i dont need to be great at maths hah excel and sql i actually did want to learn for the same reason i even looked into programming languages courses mostly python and data science on coursera data visualisation im hearing for the first time i havent started anything yet but im glad to know they will help other skills you mentioned i will look into them too cant harm having more things on your portfolio anyway should i search for the hrs now talk to them i mean sorry im confused whether you suggested that as a course of action for now or in the final year of bachelors cant switch courses got that too after undergrad ventures also got it saving these earning money through illustration sounds really good because i love to draw and wanted to learn animation for a while this is a great push for me honestly but yes these are side hustles ill try my best to surf through these sites and get in touch with more and more people and that last line is a hell lot of motivation not gonna lie just this one thing everything you suggested about building connections after undergrad building portfolio during undergrad all the skills and people and platforms im so very grateful for that and it is such a big help however forgive me but my dilemma prevails pharmacy vs btech vs bsc i just want to ask that these things you mentioned theyll help me with either of the ones i take right so exactly how do you choose i mean dont get me wrong im not asking you to make the decision for me but out of all the people ive talked to you know a lot or at least have helped me way more and after learning so much now i just want to make a choice i honestly dont think my brain can handle more confusion bsc will cut down jobs even if i learn programming languages sql excel and other things securing an ms outside india via scholarship is obviously a hectic job and a chance event more or less depends on my merit too but does that make me more qualified for jobs as qualified as btech and does pharma follow the same trajectory as for bsc or does it allow me to have better options than it ultimately what is the better shot given that i take it seriously and accompany my degree with the mentioned skills get familiar with different networks people etc and oh my god thank you so much i cannot thank you enough honestly all caps because im that grateful to you seriously nobody helped like you did just the sheer amount of information youve shared with me is astounding thank you truly,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaWxkQm5Udzc4VWdJbW51eEJFbnRDa3dNWjBhU1NPOWVMbmxoVHExbFVYZUhlbVJaRDNRQ1hfb2twV2dyYjZEa2ZWREFCNkdVYTktaXBsb3o0Y05VV1E9PQ==

remember this journey is not easy profs might tell you that you are medical rejects and that there is no scope in this field classmates will cry about the payscale and compare it to tech and finance professionals most of them will end up preparing for gate and jrf positions even though they arent interested in research you do you if you build a side hustle as a freelancer in these sciency domains you can earn enough in an international currency and will be away from the toxicity or you could do the same with data science remember data sciencce is a language you still need bio and pharma and life science knowledge to apply it also we underestimate our profs many of them have industry collabs especially in pharma colleges so be in their good books as well,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMXJ1c3Y2VTVqVFlxTng4MnV4SEZwVVBjeFhyZDZJWGxSNm5FN1dudE05M1FUSkdLWGNZS1ZkdEZWVDlOdEg3RC1IZHl0WGY3Yy1rMWdyTkdoSkVZeU11TnJaZGFJdDNDXzZ3QlVjeGU0elU9

i totally agree with you and this is how i was working on as well in the last one year i drove the projects and tried to show how that provided value to the company but the only feedback i got was its not matching the vision where vision is very abstract i then took on another project discussing the aims of the project and the questions ill be addressing etc but again the response was not matching higher vision i think as a manager one doesnt need to hold hands but help see the vision and have constructive discussions as to how those expectations could be met im sure youll agree with this being the role of manager as well,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNjNmY2JLTHIyQnlxNEktUGtaalBaaHdzaUZnZjlFYzZubE1YdGxybGowODBQUk5Ld2txU0MyZ0dWbkE4M3JEZldpNmFjZ1NmdXd4T3RtVVVsanJZQ3c9PQ==

i have used a career coach twice for short periods due to the ongoing costs of coaching thoughts coaches are of some but not great use for short term issues eg i have this problem right now at work it was still useful to discuss those things to check my thinking almost like a counselor it was also useful to check job materials like by cv its mostly useful for larger issues like what you want to do a strategy to craft the career you want ideas on workplace behaviour etc more abstract more long term theres all sorts of coaches of all sorts of skill levels and all sorts of price points shop around dont be afraid to move on and try someone new,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeER0VFZHclNuNmQxRlhneHRJNGlyNUI3anh5OHdqLWFvWEdNRm55MTNfa3JDUm1FWEdaQWQwd1BEcnpkRVF2VUNuUjA1b1Y0MW8tek1aM0w3RFduNXc9PQ==

not a specific suggestion but a general tip when looking for academic jobs consider directly asking pis who were born in your country ive observed that there is a strong hiring bias in academia most big research universities have large international populations harvard seems to attract people from all over and is obviously a good choice if you are able to convince a pi there to hire you,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY0JKN3VOWG13d0gtTDdGUXJoa0dFYWFqVHpmbVFEaUV1cUZqWk5yR3gtZ2xaQXZNUzVRWm41WXdJdTFaNzhHSm91b1dxUTQxaDUyRldZVWpVRHFVZGdaeklNQzFpd0JoaEUzUEdQVUtPSkk9

ive been on the big pharma side of diligence and youd be disappointed to see how often move fast and break stuff start up attitudes accept things like missing controls obvious controls not did you think about this kind of stuff a treatmentrelated noisy molecular result that goes unchallengedunexplained underpowered data or lack of convergent validation for a foundational result it doesnt necessarily mean the result is wrong and bad but its not always supported to a high standard because of the emphasis on speed and forward momentum big pharma doesnt always do better but innovation cant take the place of rigor if your goal is to put something in a human,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVpYcG5mR2NKa3l4eXM3MzBaRkI2UHdCM0FLYjhaM0EtaWNyQXZVdUJTMHktUldIYWV5VVQxRl9jNjZFVElteVRISEV0OEo1X2JKNldsRlpjQzNCT2c9PQ==
it probably depends on expectations of role as well if they are looking for an higher up scientific or director role in big pharma it could be possible theyd lack the political skills and influence to work cross multiple departments which is required influencing a svp of another department to build objectives is not the same at a small vs large company id personally not like to work under someone brought in that is fumbling their way through this and not enabling me to get my work done by breaking down barriers in other departments if they are being hired for individual contribution its likely they might be more rounded since small companies require more jack of all trades skills and they probably would excel quickly with the right coaching on the big pharma red tape stuff,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWjFwOEdVa3RwZWFKck1idUhCRmZjZjhDeE1Ba0tiTm9CNzdSWjZ3bWRxLWtIT1RFdW9ONm4yRDB1V3JiVmVMem10X2UxWkhEdlppWG9XYmtxVk9Kbmc9PQ==

there are two completely different worlds and this require a different approach to science big pharma can take time to really polish up their therapeutics because take io as an example someone will id a new target and then the company will throw a plethora of modalities at it with the intention of bringing all of them to phi and letting the clinical readout decide the winner there is some time pressure but the company is likely to get a winner out of it scientist grow in this environment feeling quite close to how things happened during their academic trainings of course my description is not a perfect fit for all pharma companies startups are a different species you get one tech one bag of cash and one maybe two shots at goal you have aggressive timelines cuz your cash is running out lots of competition limited resources so you have to make gng decisions with limited info most of the time scientists learn to be nimble focused and to not follow the scientific method but rather get enough info in x amount of time to make decision forward ive worked in both i have big pharmas red tape bit i did it earlier in my career ss and ps i love the speed and maneuverability of startups plus only there you truly wear multiple hats in the end good seasoned scientists will understand the environment they are in and will adapt ideally with good leadership there is no reason why a talented person wouldnt suceed in both environments,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUlFEQzFwLVdSTUIxdG00U0RobVRqY1k0elJyU1hGRGtmUDlIdU9LZ0FlUi1JUVlqVzV6cm1xR3BUR3lOSEtVcjNUQ0hNbG9WQk1WdjBOU0N0MlpEekJvRjZTd1JwMHJpelhtQlVLN1ZHTEU9

in my experience people like this are excellent in rd roles that focus on getting things done quickly but not necessarily doing it in the best way possible lots of taking shortcuts and cutting corners in order to prove a concept quickly theyre very good at these things and that can be of tremendous value ive seen them be much more independent and able to take the ball and run with it though sometimes this is a negative in the sense that theyre used to being completely autonomous and dont play nicely with others or deal well with managerial oversight its painting with a broad brush but i typically dont see these types of people being very successful or very happy in the slowerpaced realm of dotting the is and crossing the ts that comes with bringing fully vetted and tested products to market dealing with regulatory affairs and quality assurance teams etc theyre not any more or less bright or capable than people that have been kicking around at larger more established companies for the last <number><number> years it all just depends on what youre looking for i try to build my teams with a nice blend of both im at a midsized well established and publicly traded biotech,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUGFGS2dOTTNjNXVkQXJsbnBRbTNhSmp4OWRkcldld1g4RG13cDlRQTVxblNFbmFUa1JwTlVSUWxhc3JjaUFDaHQ3TDBFSFgxWHhfTlhTSEZwWG1PSGc9PQ==

since alphafold is not a homology modelling tool a previous structure is not necessary to build a new model the whole idea of af was built upon the premise that you wont have to theoretically do a nmrxray to know the structure alphafold is not yet good enough to do that for proteins that are disordered even when known adapter proteins with idps are simulated in a multimer environment it still fails to predict the structures derived from crystallography in full disclosure i havent tried the af yet and maybe things are a bit better in it,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVpFbGQ4MUZsNDhFaFlmR0NTN3lZc2p2eTNsNDI1UnZiSkpmVWRlWWFKVXZaRWl0OVJwRXlYQk9VN3lfVURjWHdiSXBVVmNGX2NPWjdqVzhidnFwcWc9PQ==

having worked for lonza and with catalent theyll both take advantage of you being a smaller biotech and slate you as less important your projects will get less priority than their larger clients which from a business perspective you cant fault them on because thats the nature of it if you do end up working with either of these companies you need a really strong cmc consultant and qa to check everything you get from them because theyll definitely try to get shoddy documents and batch records through you lonza was better on a technical level a couple years ago but the msat scientists that actually knew what they were doing left a while back so not sure what the deal is now,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYjVIOHFjbXltbVFmaVBES2xBWFRrNmctUlNHOGNFaUs0eERwSGhEZDdjT01TWEpxSjd0NHhMMzhiWElUdmFYc0owY0IwQnRLakVJdUk1U2tuXzVnS3c9PQ==

given your citizenship the current state of industry and your lack of experience this is a tricky one safety is probably easier to get into i would suggest looking at physician training programs at larger companies which sort of mentor you in the clindevsafety space but theres a lot of local competition for those another idea would be to target cro medicalsafety positions similar work and a stepping stone to sponsor side finally since these are often remote positions you could try and find a company with local and overseas offices as suggested gain experience and then make the move once youve shined up a bit or just use that accent to seduce an american and get the green card the oldfashioned way,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVWNxSVRtWlM0eEhONmp4VE9hRVhrdnh2a3Fxc3l2QXRyQjV1ZGs3MWlTSUo1TkFWdjVfdHFFYk0xdDllbXJkREREY1FyQVdhMm9xQUxscXFzMHkyWWc9PQ==

the us is definitely higher churn and offers fewer protections but the cutting certainly happens in the eu as well its also a highly cyclical industry so you tend to be unemployed when everyone else is so the length of searches are longer the one nice thing about being laid off is severance if youre good have a skillset that lets you find another job quickly you can switch to the next thing quickly and pocket the severance and maybe add a hiring bonus on top of that last time i was laid off it took three months to find a job but i took in about <cur>k in severance and unemployment worth my trouble in my opinion and also a more positive way of framing a layoff as an unexpected benefitwindfall instead of something to be feared,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY3VUU2hsU3VwVVIxeGVzODgwMng0RjltaWg2WVdXSGZLUjhVc2s2Z2VsQlBNZklGR0F6eXp4T0tXYllLeW1paDg3SG8yRmo4al9aSEV0Yl92dzFaeUE9PQ==
it often depends on the company most of the big companies have some sort of severance for layoffs and then there is a state based unemployment that typically lasts <number> months different states also have something called the warn notice which applies when the layoffs impact more than a certain number of people or are a site closing whats nice about warn notices is you at least get <number> to <number> months depending on the state of notice before it happens so you can start looking while employed if you arent covered by the notice i believe its up to the employers discretionmercy that could mean youre gone today or a month from when informed,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYXZBQm1aYjhqdnJWNVlTUmJZUFNhOXlRN1pYcHppcVVsb3JFNFZ1MHdaTWRocFA3QldqRU84VEVKcV9ESVVLN28wSHp2UHc4aVNOcDZiRnhwZ0h0eHc9PQ==

greetings i wish i could provide a meaningful advice i am somewhat of a contrarian based solely on my own life experience i find most of the advice either useless or totally wrong for example during my postdoc i very quickly realized that i was wasting time the pi tried to lie to all of us talking about publications in nature or science no one believed him all postdocs understood that it would take somewhere between <number> to <number> years to even have a try to get to nature what mistake did i make well i am a former life scientist so naturally i hoped expected to find a job in biotech pharma government lab plus i listened to questionable advice from cheeky scientist etc all waste of time about <number> years ago i was sending applications all across canada from bc to ontario and pei i am sure that i sent over a hundred applications only to get a job of a project manager in a noname place from what i hear these days a hundred is a minimum essentially i should have tossed aside my lab skills i should have learned how to code back then computer programming was picking up steam and there was a real chance to switch careers because the barrier to entry was reasonable now the situation is vastly different the entry barrier is higher there way more people competing for fewer entrylevel jobs salaries are not that great etc what was a reasonable opportunity to change careers it does not exist anymore another bs advice in my opinion is to customize your application resumecover letter have you noticed that no one talks about what exactly is meant by this customization how significant should it be imagine you are sending two job applications per day you spend minimum <number> min to customize your resume cover letter is my time estimate realistic probably not you have to find a job posting on linkedin read it couple of times see if it fits even remotely probably google the company etc start rewriting your resume cover letter submit them in response to the job opening for me it will definitely take more than <number> min per job posting,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNGdaQTl1Y05pQkN3Tko1VDJVZzJrU3NqSEJYMlZoWUx4d2FGLUFjZzl3cGZxQ2l4RXQ2TzRCYlJ6UzI2N2lUVGd5Q1o0eWpPZ2tRSGRQdU02ckhneHlwVGVJalY3NDlBNmlzSDZkWjhIa289

i disagree with not getting too attached to colleagues i think i know what youre trying to say but networking is important some estimates report as high as <number> of jobs in this industry are through connections some of the older scientists ive worked with have wound up at the same company multiple times throughout their careers its a soft skill to have people you work with actually enjoy working with you not everyone has this skill lol i havent had to rely on my network at this point i have been at three companies and i got them all through applying and interviewing most recent change in april <number> but when you start looking for a new job it is reassuring to know people are looking out for you and are willing to vouch for you it makes the job hunt much less stressful,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRVJ1UGhDVmxuN1FidVdzcnByNHlNQ3p2cmU5bi1EcjlsMDg4M0xmS1VSX051b1BGZnZGdzVISnhFVHlNTTJiNUREY01pS1I3YTIyRVhjR0g4YnExZTdGbk1nckJsdDdRcG8yTTAtajd5dWc9
can we stop using words like victim to describe mundane topics like layoffs there was no crime committed nobody is victimized in a layoff using legal language which implies a crime was committed in an otherwise trivial situation or using the language of pathology to describe the human condition is getting so incredibly out of hand that framing robs the individual of agency in their situation to either avoid or remedy the problem,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMGFtR1VvWk9NLXUtR0FydVRvd2FKNTdZMDhwd0ZMS1N6TTkwcXBTZW8tclF3SnBxSkJQcF9SNmgwM2hSVlFFQ09rZUU3eTdOQUx0Q2o2MnBkdVRuRkpaaEVtSnFEc2JYVlBCVnhIdlVlVHc9

having network and professional relationships are different than attachment i was talking about i have seen people getting too attached like best friends forever and then it would hurt you emotionally when layoffs happens i doubt any of the colleagues would refer you or vouch for you for the same job they are interested or interviewing for at the end people would secure their own ass and not yours in some situations i didnt say burning bridges and not have network we will all cross roads at one point as we are in same industry and same area but keep it professional to save your mental peace as op was talking about insecurity,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMWtSQ0JJcG1ic2cwOUxtNkhGSFJHeXdkWnRlVF9UamxxenNsSjZSN0plMFlYV0NPbDNidHhvM3hGTVhiWDhSc0VkV2ZBbHk5SXJkTW9EUFVQWC1ReFE9PQ==

something i have learned is that you have to drive your own growth and internal promotion its not going to be handed to you just for getting the work done years of experience is one thing but working on the right deliverables and making a business driven case for why promotion is deserved is another is there a clear framework for job ladders and promotion at your company if so i would consider mapping out the projectsdeliverables you have completed matches what is required for promotion then use that to have a discussion with your manager if there is something missing it could also be an opportunity to work smarter not harder and plan what the rest of <number> could look like for you the best time to find a new job is while you have one the market is rough right now so it could take <number> months <number> yr to find the right next fit in the meantime you have nothing to lose by trying to grow at your current company unless its a highly toxic workplace,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYUt5M1k0S0pBcHFrNEswdEdWOVQ2OThlYVR5N0dCNEE5TnhGZzE3TDZZZlJKLXB1NXFZdEZMeDZURDI4SG45Z0VUMEVIeEVhRU5PdkpiR3FKNEY2TWc9PQ==

i do not really understand the question do you refer to adc as in specifically antibodyoligo conjugates because that is not really a hot topic but still a very niche thing industry wide i think there are only a very few companies in advanced clinical trials and those who are are in very limited therapy areas its certainly a very interesting development but if you think about manufacturing cost or scalability it seems to be a absolute nightmare only feasible for rare disease with high disease burden if you ask me at the moment and cost of oligos will come down eventually so it may change and i would say that small molecule expertise at its core is still essential for chemists working in adcs and oligos as well as oligoadcs,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTFd6LS01bTNmSkQ2ZTBkNFBoUzJMbzVLTTJKaFRwdEllT0dlLWtIMUJOQmZUUE5NTXFwNkU5YVlXSnlTRkhQUGNxemZKbVdwUWdXdTNaYXR1c09QeGVoZDMtTmhIM3A2ay0wcE5zSWtkcVk9

laid off fall of <number> i hustled and had <number> offers by middecember pocketed the <number> extra months severance as well as <number> months unemployment so it turned out great but the truth is it really sucked there was no warning from the company no indication cuts were coming and it really shook my confidence and sense of self worth nondescript meeting from my manager at <number> and at <number><number> my computer was inaccessible people need to understand that that is how it works plan accordingly i did not and it made things harder i can only speak for the us what folks must understand is that pay is much better than europe but safeguards are generally less generous the way to make this work is to pay yourself as if you worked in europe for the first year or two in order to save up a very good emergency fund at least <number> months my wife has a stable but lowerpaying job and i have two kids near collegeage once we cut out retirement investing <number> savings the cleaning ladies and a few other relatively painless changes it was clear we could go for a very long time before we had to dig into the emergency fund let alone rainy day fund or retirement savings if its possible this is the position you want to be in it would not have been possible for us earlier in my career there were times within about the first <number> yrs out of grad school that a layoff would have been very challenging and forgoing retirementcollege savings for many months or years certainly would not be ideal i have no parting words of wisdom that will make everything ok my new company may get bought this year and since im relatively new this would not be much of a payday so i may be right back in the ring or i may become a stay at home husband or switch careers i dont know but i do know this i will not give away my physical or mental wellbeing to any company no matter how much they pressure me to perform im pushing <number> now and ill tell you if you dont take care of yourself and i mean dealing with stress especially it will come back to bite you in the ass at a time of life that youd still like to be feeling healthy dont give that away whatever it takes take care of yourselves physically and mentally workout every day even if its just half an hour nurture your social interactions spend time with your parents hug your kids,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaEl6bW9xX3ZOaGR2VnNZSTBPTGp0cmZRQlBhTTdwTk51UlVYM1Y0UnkyU1U1R0RCTmJ6ZGFub3JHVFJfOGI3emc0ak1XcW4wMTNnTGVEdmNGZlA2MjBaRUUwcjE5UVlJNzRRRXlZV3dXa2s9

as someone who took a similar route the question is twofold what do you enjoy doingare good at doing and what is impactfulvaluable not just to the company but to keep you relevant and growing there are so many career paths and i would network across and outside your company to find out what those entail some may not be open to you based on your degree or your company so that can direct you to either obtaining that degree or look elsewhere eventually at the moment it sounds like you like doing more of what you already are doing so the immediate question is whether you want to deepen your expertise or apply it to more leadership and management roles personally i went with the latter there are definitely some areas where im an acknowledged expert but i found more fulfillment in using that to influence decisions and strategy as well as coach and mentor others,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNE4wTEFnY2NGQ3ZMQ0IxQ1ZoWE41UkFTSU5hbWZPeHhWSUFxOFpkdnh5ZVZ3bzRsdzEyUzNtYUV0ZmU3RF9JYU4zSklGTXZXLWUxR3hveUF6ODlkMFE9PQ==

biochem faculty here im guessing from this question op has no chemistry research or internship experience it will be very hard to break into pharma without this even at the entry level tracking hundreds of graduates over the last decade those with strong research experience had almost double the chance of landing a science job within <number> months of graduation ie ><number>+ vs < <number> this is at a large public university in ne us nonprestigious but r op is already graduated meaning they cannot apply to reus or internships either in such a scenario i would highly recommend considering a chemistry masters with thesis at the nearest research intensive state school as a way to get hands on lab experience into your resume ms are rarely funded so instate tuition if you are in the us will be the best bang for the buck it doesnt have to be a fancy school but it does a need to be research intensive so you can join a research lab do a proper thesis and hopefully get hands on experience with every type of analytical equipment that industry uses our ms students have a <number> success rate getting pharmabio manufacturing jobs by time they graduate as we happen to be located near several manufacturing hubs and other regional schools are either not research intensive or do not offer thesis ms degrees they have the virtue of putting you at the top of the list for bs+experience jobs ms counts as experience while not over qualifying you for entry level positions as can often be the case for phds see a more detailed discussion in this previous thread <url>,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ25SMG9melV6eXFYRFNfN2NpQmt4MGlKc0xOVEE4dmNyUWwtdmtUZGc0RVF6Y1FweUhlZHZQbUctS1Mwb016NWYyOEFwTmVyLWE2dnkwdG5sOVNBWGc9PQ==

i think the way to generate value is to either <number> develop the technology whether that be the structural component ie the bio ink or the scaffolding or the printer itself or <number> find a novel use for the simplified version of bioprinting that is actually achievable from a cro standpoint where companies that sell bespoke biorpinting as a service have failed is in the pricepoint back in the early days of this technology big pharma would have to pay six figures to get a <number>well plate of transwells that had pseudo liver tissue printed on them thats only enough material to test at most <number> compounds the price point was set due to the insanely high cost of scaling up the technology primary cell isolation cost of developing suitable materials like bio ink and structural components the immense cost of developing the printers themselves and then all of the cash burned in not only proving the consistency of the product but also that surrogate pseudo tissue matches the clinically accpeted biomarkers of real patient studies i think the real payout would have to be in the advancement of the bioprinters themselves if someone could figure out a tangible way to improve the functionality of printer nozzles in a way that advances the geometry that we can commercially print that would be a huge huge leap forward and it wouldnt come close to advancing this tech for an application in regenerative medicine yet it would alter the bioprinting landscape as we know it,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR0VUWm1TZnQwOXo3QXpxVGQxWkFPRFBVa3JUVXBfUktodVNWYmFFR3QxaXZDcTBfQlllNFljSURBbXRqd3h4SkZTY0RCNHBQeTV2QlMweWozZjJBMVE9PQ==

honestly your undergraduate major is not nearly as critical for career as it may seem now so dont stress too much i hired a theatre major into a quality group a few years ago for example any life science degree would support a next step into either industry or med school id probably do biology general bio or even biochemistry if thats your thing vs biotech to give yourself more flexibility dont worry at <number> about a masters or doctorate because your interests may change its also generally not recommended to do a masters straight from undergrad because the value isnt there for entry level its basically a bachelors degree in a fancy hat,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSWI0U2pwOGExRXJXTkZvN2xya2MtNDg2VVFtTUMwZEVfZkljenhwOXZKMWtpRTN3dDBOZ3lKNldSdWdSZXlIZjludG5rUFZhLUxjc1h0QTZ6cGtzcEE9PQ==

for a lab tech role id guess theyll be less interested in the research itself and more in the process lab techniques and equipment used documentation challenges you encounteredovercame improvements you made to the labs ways of working be sure to look into good laboratory practices to get a sense of what working in a regulated lab is like and how the rules differ from the academic environment as your first industrial placement they wont necessarily expect you to understand glp deeply but theyll want you to understandappreciate that being a lab tech in pharma is very different than doing lab work for academic research a simple example is the treatment of outoftrend or outofspec results in academia you might be able to get away with just tossing the result and running the equipmentsample again in pharma there is no erasing bad data and you must formally investigate to determine if the result was valid and if not what caused the error everything is tracked traced and documented in ways you might not be accustomed to,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWFFuNVJ6TXJ0MlBDemIwQnZEQ0I1LTN0UnVYQUZleWhJcWtNMUt4N2hWTU05TkFscXQwNVlfQ09ESlFRSzd4VlNsU3FVTndjdi1CclRlTVdqeE1teGc9PQ==

we have a clear resume problem your resume is too generic nothing screams expertise not accomplishments this is what i would expect from an undergrad associate scientist as a postdoc your productivity is measured by your publications you need to add a bullet point on number of publications and relevance do the same with your grad study for example n publications including fancy journal <number> with over if number is impressive citations i would also recommend getting rid of your summer internship from <number> and older its almost <number> years ago its no longer relevant you can use that space for expanding your thesis and specialty but tailor it to the job youre applying or something that shows relevance to the job and something needs to be cleared up are you a postdoc or graduate student this is extremely vague,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQUhFQWh3RE42ZV9VdmJXb1QtR3I4MEo4TE1GLW9yT0ZJd0hKSmtUX1VXV3ZWaFZadnNOcWk2Zk5ZaFp2VE1FUHZWb1BHZXROeGJKNm9xMkdXTTdDdFE9PQ==

do not turn the opportunity down you already met the hiring manager and they think youre worthy of presenting and that alone makes you qualified if you want to apply for scientist level roles youre going to need to give job talks so you might as well figure out how to make the best of it this way youll at least have one made that you can work off of in the future as far as how you approach the presentation id do the following email the recruiter or hiring manager if not applicable and ask for clarification about the expectations for the presentation they may be different than you think and it may end up helping you refamiliarize yourself with your projects you will need to be an expert during this talk present everything that you can data or no as long as youre in the clear to do so just be up front when data is missing to head off any questions about it its okay to present projects at a higher level if thats all you can do you wont embarrass yourself the worse case scenario is that you gain some valuable experience for future interviews the best case scenario is that you get the job,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQTlSMHU3eWtPWmxybzVwT1lkNmxxa29ka2hFSmY1SWUwOE9xVU9VQXdyMkJua2phTHJEeXJtc3VwV0UyZUNoMzRmRnFScHkxd0R1UTJNRjQzN1podFE9PQ==

i had a similar situation a few years ago most of these talks focus on a past project and give details on what they did and the analysisresults since i could not present data or share specific project details from work at my past company i formatted the presentation as an argument for why i was a good fit for the role first slide gave an overview and structure to the talk what topics will be covered and why i was covering them these are the things i didcan do which make me a great fit for the role i started off with <number> slides giving a brief background of who i was credentialsbackground etc and what i like to do ice breaker give the team insight to who you are as someone they will have to spend hrs a day with then i talked about the requirements of the role and highlighted the ones of most importance and i had direct experience with <number><number> main points talked about a past project situation that directly relates to one of the job requirements without giving proprietary info and what specifically i did for the project talked about the technical skills involved and a problem i overcame along with the result repeated the same for <number> other job requirements then i talked about what i can bring to the role and the department outside of what was already talked about hopefully youve asked the hiring manager about any skill gaps the team is missing and you have those skills this would be the time to highlight them or anything you think may boost yourself you dont need to talk at length about one project but highlight what you did and what you can do you can provide faked data for your interpretations if you need to if you dont remember details about something you did dont talk about it because follow up questions will be awkward if you dont remember the entire study thats fine just talk about the skills you used,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRjRVVl9QYjBCLUVGVGhlUU1XUUJFcHdyVjBiLTk2OVdZRVhyc1lGNkRfOGxUMWFBUGkwdTJYSjYyLXhadkQxMThDMExXZTY5QWxMRlN1cFdGVUYxc0gwVlRTdDNSa0lvOEVycnhfeWZRVlU9
to add on to everyones comments youll probably want to elaborate more on different aspects of your experience depending on what positions youre applying for industry is a lot more segmented and specialized than academia and your resume makes you look like a jack of all tradesmaster of none im sure youre work was more thorough and detailed than what youve listed here so i would dive more into specific assays and techniques youve done to help get through some of the candidate screening filters a protein purification role for example might want you to go more in depth about your cell akta work so start listing things like different chromatography techniques you have experience in affinity iex rp sec etc projects youve led and troubleshot if you can disclose and important milestones can be anything from papersconference presentations to simply completing a specific project or goal just glancing at your resume the departments that pop immediately to mind that would be easiest to focus toward would be related to protein purification molecular biology protein design in vitro pharmacology and specific areas where your did your phd in,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSDFSZDY3MUM0em5hZnlmeWpxN1VZQ3FxcERTZldRdUIzTm04S1QtRV9BeE9WcUlwUFFWY2FDS19MaFRRMjZuWUE4QlBwY3N6UVI2enZNS2ZjdDNQRVE9PQ==
your job was to validate did you author protocols publish a summary report make any improvements i realize its difficult to do some of these things in an internship im just fishing to try and help you out a simple thing to do is is look at the skills being asked for in the jobs youre applying to and work them into the resume somewhere yes the candidate molecule advancing is worth mentioning briefly ie validated blah blah for candidate molecule enabling advancement to preclincial studies there are subtle little benefits to statements like this they make you sound more successful and it adds preclinical as a keyword hit even,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSUVWbkVzdnRickd0RHBFSVFOam95TVVnTTlQcFdSVFZ4M2JmUnlicG1PZUUyRG5QY2hrblVieTJSSFlFNmpBdmpKQ3ZuOHMzcDhJRTVNQlo1UjdmdGc9PQ==

it will differ depending on what area youd like to get into my biggest advice i give to most people trying to get into industry in any way is to get as much handson experience as possible in school and the more niche tech you can get your fingers on the better some examples of technologies to consider would be microscopy confocal fluorescent etc nmr mass speclcms flow cytometry ftir rtpcr next gen sequencing etc etc getting that type of experience will make you stand out amongst the slew of new graduates that probably only have molecular biology or wet lab experience but with the job market right now i should caution you that you might need to pay your dues for a while before getting these types of positions regardless of your experience in college im part of hiring for my team and were looking for pretty highly experienced people since you need to be the expert in the field in order to be able to do application development or support for customers in the pharmabiopharma space as a reference almost everyone on my team had been in their respective field for at least five years before they got hired with us some <number>+,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQTdSeTkycWpQTHN6cUtJN2pkWEhRTXpiOUt0YV9Wbi00XzY0UmxFNTd2NWpGMHBOdEdLdFpuLTB3UGREZ2NIckg4QnlkbFk0eVRxYzVuTEFLMjQyYkE9PQ==

<number> chance you are not an expert at all those things and presenting yourself as one is probably turning hiring managers off cell line development that means something different in industry than making a ko line monoclonal antibody assessment so you did some facts on a wt vs ko line once again assessment of an antibody means something very different in industry thats binding kinetics stability assessment etc on top of that you are a master data analyst and programmer in between doing library construction and a bit of confocal on the side might as well take my job while you are at it if you have time,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMEYwcDdSRnowU243a0poeC1sejZ2aWdESDdLRTZqMUo0Y0tBZkxZN29ETTM3VTZZQWI2LVFkUGV2ZTdsVDJaSWdrNHJyV3l0Mm4zdjZKSktVZTBQS3c9PQ==
to be fair to that person the question was do you have the necessary technical skills for the positions youre applying to and their answer was my skills are and i dont think either of those necessitate claiming to be a hyperexperienced super scientist its good to note that you shouldnt write your resume in a misleading way though,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSnVYZmxjeVJzX19NSDJtamh3SDgwT3BEZkFtWU4wZk1tNTdubDFYd2t3bnNhR2R4U3NuMnU1WENuZDhKcmVJT3pvLTY2OHBxa1ZXU1R0VG96TThmc0QyVjIwdXk0LUdBUWE0VU9QRDBsRkU9
to give my n=<number> experience big pharma neuro rd during covid we hired a bunch of fresh phds straight from school without a postdoc but before that time a postdoc was essentially a necessity to be competitive nowadays the hiring trend is reverting back towards the precovid era for my company you really need a postdoc especially when there are internal postdocs competing for any jobs that get posted i get it it sucks i certainly didnt want to do one but it may be necessary depending on your search have you looked at industry postdocs they can be a good way to get your foot in the door and while they pay under a scientist role theyre still ~k with retirement,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYm8wUFc4T096N3ViSldUMExGT3ZvVDNrcUp3U3FGeHBTSXppRnNPR05GNi1RVGhSd1NUX1ZsaWo2ZTd2U2RRRExOYzZfSndwdVV5c3J4cENYcmpnWlE9PQ==
ive heard it as a place thats so good to work at that people dont leave my understanding is that they do profit sharing and every new hire dilutes the pool because of that everyone in the company is allowed to interview any candidate they are very selective about talent because of this the people ive known who worked there loved it,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWHBuVVM0V1NOcGJMVUNoT2diNUQzZDBXY05oTHRwNjZEdjRzNnVZbktBUlBqVHlIVTllcmVGMDFSR3dBdU1kNXMxZHdQeVpoaHItOWtlakpqa3B1emc9PQ==
i know three people who work there and they all love it great culture good worklife balance and the profit sharing makes the total compensation well above average even if base salaries are relatively low many workers stay there a long time,r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUW5uMlRrczNKS1E2RmZzUkNOSlYwR2JwajZRTWYwZC1hdGZMOHJCRXJNbHpuQ0szN2hxbVJzVVNtSTRBN1NLSVRWdHdYWnlEUzFzc29sMms4WjFPSUE9PQ==
