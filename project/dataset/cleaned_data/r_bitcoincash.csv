> the authors seem to make the claim that miners wield the most political power within the bitcoin ecosystem because they have the largest capital investment but due to cultural or psychological reasons they deferred to the seeming authority of bitcoin core i also found myself frowning at that thought it was frankly not falling in place with earlier conversations ive had with roger it felt like a shortcut to avoid overcomplicating things for the reader the basic concept of bitcoin is to balance out a free market a market open to competition and selfish interests because those are directed towards building the whole as such miners just mine the most profitable way and holders users of the coin just hold the most useful coin which closes this circle by making the miners get paid more each of those has political power the problem in <number> <number> was that the circle was corrupted and as a result there was no open market there were not really any alternative coins to pick from there were no ways to profit as a miner by simply giving the middle finger to bitcoin core this is the reason those miners kept on following as the threat were always there as part ii showed very clearly the people behind bitcoincore were not afraid to use any and all means needed to keep miners in line they have shown they could and would bankrupt miners and pools that went against the narrative anyway just read the book its still very much onpoint about everything even though this was a bit of a shortcut to avoid complexity,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVMU55MUNKMlFwb0h2dUxfbzJBUVVOWjkybFlpOThnbmhXQjd1MnlLc0FkNkVrRkw4Rm9fNDRvT0VyRkdiZmhUZjhPblNHMTRsYkh3ZUQyRjFTVmtWaFE9PQ==

the whole thing with percentage blocks mined with a flag was likely responsible for the thought that miners have political power the initial idea was to avoid a hard set forkdate and instead do it when the miners have upgraded their software to the latest and we can know this is the case by the new software putting a marker in blocks so there were websites that counted the percentage of blocks in the last week to get a feel when the miners were ready and wed see the upgrade happen that was the intention that is how it was designed but people started seeing it as voting miners voting for or against something and miners had no intention of taking that spot the moment it got used as a mechanism for voting was when things started going severely wrong,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVMUZnTUhZVGdGalhjZnpWUVE2aE5UaTNfSHE3b0EwaWJSSWVIck9IUXc4RWpRZmY3emFlSWpBZl96MkdLSVZYUnBKVXRPVzdPaVlzLXMyVU82Y1dqeUE9PQ==

in theory no because bitcoin cash has bigger blocks and bets on having many transactions at low fees to reward miners validators in the future which can be a problem if there is little adoption and use but we can see that it works for solana,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVaEJRc0xLMGVfaENxcHo4MERZWmZzRDdVanpsd3BnWmU3ZzZDUnM4OGZGTDd4ZTBPNU0wSU5nUi1INGRDWGtRX0RKNW5qSjNHWEg0bHhLUmxYb2hyMHc9PQ==
solana uses a different protocol bch uses the same as btc bigger blocks dont matter since if you look at the me pool for bch many of the blocks are empty btc block are mb but can expand to mb the amount of transactions increase especially with bch with so few validators you will have to pay increasing fees to fight for quick validation,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVdnVSZ2JGY29faE9Lcy1IVnotQ0R4NXBUVWQ2TjRPLVREdzZGQ1cxdndMdnpwVU55ZjBENVlVcGNRd3Z5YlFNRWp0UHNFa2wyYVNuYUotYjFQSERSM0E9PQ==

hi op thank you for raising this very fundamental question like all network we had to start somewhere if bitcoin cash is so good in comparison to thousands of coins out there why people are not using it just an analogy what good does the best phone in the world brings if there is no one you can call this is where bitcoin cashs reality sadly stands at the moment people are not using bitcoin cash because they are unwilling to use bitcoin cash simple as that i dont have the definitive answer to why people dont want to use bitcoin cash but being part of the crypto community for the past decade++ have thought me that humans are tribal creatures just imagine what kind of btc dominant tribalconformity pressure a normal person will face if that person use bitcoin cash i have been called a scammer for just being a supporter of bch imagine what a normal manonthestreet would feel like living in that kind of community i was that man i would conform easily i hope the above examples gives you a clue on why bch dont see much support despite being a more useful and technicallysound tool,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbnRnSkFUZ1FMbXoxN3NtRHVtSnI4Uk5Uc3pZVmJCdV9CRXUwNkF2eEFMRHdscUxoeWVSTmQzaUIwLXUtYnJaRE1jSmlJYlJpTmlXNVF5cFN6ejRncEE9PQ==
ok and that is by holding and not using onchain that the bitcoin cash model may not work long term because it needs to have many transactions onchain in order to reward miners validators in the future and also because the block rewards will decrease,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWel9HTWtyT2RNMjFwMEFTd1RXNzVudmpJcVdqZmRWem1mNG9melNrOUFleGFnZERjQTcwV3pYQVh2OWRtQXJILTB5RjdFMHpvbmNjS240Q2piM2hHVXc9PQ==
personaly i had <number> bad experiences with centralized exchanges so after that i decided to keep my funds on the networks on different networks on different wallets ethereum polygon tron bsc solana algorand avalanche because on such networks i can transfer funds with fast transactions at low fees except on ethereum  but also swap between a native token and a stable token which is really useful to manage my positions but i cant do that with bitcoin cash or with monero fortunately nowadays we can use instant swaps exchanges via trocador or cross networks swaps via thor swap so this may be less a problem in the future,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbnAwOElxdjBodEU5ZGVkM2NuZjFzb0NwS1VmOUZPNXd0MU5RRGNlS0pCck5FUFFpcXp2RWk4V1VtZGY4TUZIZVdmWHZKSVIzX0RwbFZUcnMwRmpJdlE9PQ==

i agree if they want to buy it its their choice however i think its damaging to bch as it prevents adoption for actual usage people prefer to do the easy thing and will buy an etf as its much easier than buying and managing actual bch all this will do is create a ponzi scheme instead of allowing people to use it as a currency it seems that people have the wrong idea about bitcoin it was meant to be peer to peer cash and not some weird investment vehicle but youre right people are free to choose,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWQ0pvZGdMUTB3TmdqNEFFZUdIQ25tTkhOZ2hHUWJVQzdPck1QRE5HdURMVEF4WnVJaEhxT1N0aHlZM3NpanhpcW8ta1hEd3NONl9BY1BGdFR4THZ3T1E9PQ==
thats mostly correct though a <number> attack could theoretically reverse a transaction practically thats not going to happen without great financial or political reasons so your transactions will be fine its huge amounts that would be targeted which themselves would probably be devalued by the attack itself undermining trust in the system if the attack even succeeds,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbFdnblhFWU4xNW81QzZZN1I0cjl3SWEtNXNoTmZFRjRnNFRSMFFfZGkyR1FKVkhLalNkYzFCWVdweGIzcUFjU1pfVkZFaXRDTHVRYVRJM0pVRWlaNVE9PQ==

yes thats correct as soon as a merchant has seen the payment broadcast they can be sure that they now have control of the value of that transaction theoretically there are some attack vectors that could make that not happen but there hasnt been a case of it happening in <number> years they are all very expensive and most wont work all the time they all depend on people that have large investments in the value of bch deciding that helping you get something for free is worth more than those investments it is very likely cheaper for them to just buy it for you the largest threat for a merchant by a very long way is they store coins in someone elses wallet and then they steal it,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWQTR4Q1RzVUhpQU1jM1ZLZ2VSOGt2QnFBcGpUUXg0UXpjNkQ5UHJEd1hkYnVFclBNQWR2STlxazctYXJvbUgyc0xVQWNyYmw3bXlvVWkyMDVMaTBqeEE9PQ==

because it wasnt about avoiding making blocks bigger it was about containing bitcoin and moving activity to their side project they also reactivated rbf claiming it was needed to create a fee market but in reality was just to break the original network moremake <number>conf transactions impossiblemake the original network less safe to use to push the need for confirmations transactions broadcast on the network are nearly impossible to reverse within <number> seconds confirmations not needed changes to harm bitcoin started when the developer that knew satoshi was forced from the project and another original developer started ethereum that was supposed to happen on the bitcoin network but was made intentionally impossible with core changes,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiaTFMcWVRWlFnSExteE9sdndhRTQybXZDVnhPbGc2WHlFSHY4LU5iaTVxbi0tM3JMU0Q0X0lrVzBBd0NKSTc4VVBBbEttZE9uWkREcWVJZy1fOTBfYXc9PQ==

thats incorrect miners can choose what transactions to include in a block including a later transaction spending the same inputs as an earlier transaction some miners will respect first seen safe but others wont in most cases especially for small sums its safe to accept zero confirmation transactions as its unlikely someone would try to defraud you like that but theres no guarantee,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiNHg1cDhIWHJ5QjhLaFVmMGkxeGhLeWljRzdXTEhWUjVLOU1hNTF2dUxyaXliTEJDZW1fX2Q4NjBkZXNtUEFNaVNrTHM0Wkk3ZC1tek1VTjF4ZUNYTWc9PQ==

bch is first seen first safe and doesnt have rbf unconfirmed bch transactions are good enoughsafe enough for most transactions i would still want <number> confirmation if i was selling <cur><number> worth of gold or something but for sake of argument if you were to be developing a merchant pos system for btc the best way to handle it is have a pos system that handles bip bip rather than providing a qr code with a btc address and amount will instead provide a url that url contains the payment details such as addressamountfeememo and a callback url so your wallet gets the payment details from the url signs the transaction and sends the transaction to the callback url the callback url examines the signed transaction and says this looks right and the merchant will broadcast the transaction to the network if for example the signed transaction has rbf enabled the merchant can reject the transaction and not broadcast it or if the btc tx fee is too low the merchant can reject it and not broadcast it,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQkZsdmlaY0xjTXdseFlRYjBUTV9kMEIyLVQ2Znp6QW1qR01QbHJoejByMV9JOGhXMm00S0Q3ek5aY2lfSmxVcC1ia2xYTXIzdzdtSEU2dmRaSWdfcEE9PQ==

maybe i am a little confused about the connection between random key pairs and wallet addresses i understand a little that i can generate random key pairs with ssl can i then generate addresses from that eventually i would need to import into a wallet to retrieve and move the funds but they would all have been created and stored in cold storage maybe a way to look at it is that im building my own hardware wallet i can use an ubuntu live cd to create a temporary operating system can then install a new blank wallet and import the relevant keysthen do the transactions and when done i remove the live cd and reboot everything was transacted and cleared the remaining keys are still safely in their offline file and never were exposed to hackers another advantage is it separates the hardware the key storagedata storage and the wallet software from each other a hardware crash is not a concern because any pc can be used,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlLW9QV2lhYjN2UGNOV1JkRXdmX2swVWdQVVBjMFEwM2hlbGY2dy00Z3JDLUhrSncxMmJQejRBY3FZc042Y0x0ZklueU9OaXNyRURMdHY3S29TS1FIRnhmWWxoWWFFcF9mSWsyRXgxdnkxZk09
it could be millions of addresses this is for a web app that enables website operators to earn crypto from there websitethere <number> billion websites the app generates a yellow pages type web directory and advertisers get listed on all the installationsthey can bid for better postion but they have to prefund their account so we will need a new deposit address each time that an advertiser wants to load or top off their balance the plan so far is to store the public addresses in a db and deliver one upon request from an advertiser confirming the deposit is not an immediate concern,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNGpvd0JkLWRVWDZhbFcybk1sVVNCaWdPejRpT2hMVElUamFRZnNNUks5cS1CT1NrWktodFNEeFA0ZS1mQS1wOGhRcldMNFJ6TFVpamxGRjZUMWlaZ05hWFhoWTlvX0NWY0JvR3FRM0VFS0U9

sure im using ubuntu easiest way for me would probably be to call the rpc keypoolrefill with <number> eg and then after its done generating you can call the rpc dumpwallet to save them all to a file then simply go through the file with a bash script perhaps and call the rpc validateaddress to check if isvalid is true and getaddressinfo to check if ismine is true save private and public keys to db of your choice and done some other options would be to use <url><url> offline or run a bash script and call the rpc getnewaddress in the case of keypoolrefill possibly making your wallet unresponsive for some time repeat steps of using dumpwallet or if you prefer you could also use dumpprivkey and just check that they are all valid before saving to db,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUjkwMThLWkd5dGROXzAtLUFidUZuQzdGX1JTWFVoYWh4U0ZUc2w3R3ZKb3FiM21OODcxbEhzMnhpU1BXalBGazhCUXVHa3FFVDh1dWwtaXNFSVdEaWc9PQ==

firstly an address that most people see can be considered to be an encoded form of a public key regarding key generation choosing random keys versus a hd style wallet depends on your requirements around recreating those keys if you have method to retain random keys forever and accept the fact there is no easy way to back them up other than copying them then random keys probably provide some security benefit on the other hand if you want to be able to copy those keys or the method to create them for purposes such as backup then hd allows you to restore them using <number>word mnemonics or similar to elaborate a little further you can consider hd wallets to implement a tree of keys where the leaves are child keypairs the public key of which is an address if you can remember the root of the tree and the child generation process then you can recreate the entire tree at the end of the day a keypair is a keypair i suspect for the purpose youve described youll go down the random keypair path,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWkhXdnkxcW1zcUJlcldRR3h0b0Q3VHJlLUZkUngxd2NDQW5CUlNySXJYODhUVnZJWE1IeVVMdGxwazltR0FfRzRxZnJULU5lQk5uTGw0bHhiVjQzTlE9PQ==

sometimes i do wonder if roger ver not just him had been jack maed jack ma was a lot more restrained on his criticism of the government even so jack disappeared and when he reappeared he became a really good boy when george donnelly got appointed as the mod even though briefly at rbtc that thought did cross my mind and i wouldnt blame roger i mean when the government tells you he will beat you up and take everything away from you or the alternative is to do some stuff for them what are you gonna do call the police lol government is like a big bully they can just come up with false accusations and use the countrys resources to put any person in prison and that person can just disappear even if he is a well known influential billionaire like jack ma i would be surprised if blockstream or tether is not working for the government,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvNkFYR0hmSW9vVnAyMkhBLTgyekZ2NDUxZnh5UGh0aDNSRUZRUmN3OGM5V01FMlppWVdFVjVkLXNhaUlmeEtYSGh2X2NkWGxyc1phcWZHaEVtZl9PdXc9PQ==

i agree i dont think roger was jack maed but just putting it as a possibility out there i am not just talking about roger because the government can go after anyone so when you see a person supporting pp money in the past and then the behavior changes drastically maybe something happened behind the scenes having pp money is going to be very bad for the people who control the money supply eg governments banks etc i have no doubt they are willing to do very bad things to anyone who is a problem,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSXZNMnZfMVY3c0Y5a3ZzZGRVRWoyaGY2N0YwNjNYcDlLWFFRQ0U2bFVrM2JDRTNBNk5taEpNWUczUktGa0tIcFhPZTVPUlRKMmdrVENVQmlWelgwY0E9PQ==

hi fireduck thanks for coming here and not taking offense to my post the issues surrounding roger specifically his awful actions against the former modteam his decision to insert a trusted agent as a middle layer of management and then his subsequent arrest was like a giant explosion of red flags for most of us after everything we bigblockers have been through the personal attacks the censorship and bannings the affinity attacks from craig and others etc i can say for myself im gunshy and triggerhappy as a result i was instantly suspicious of you not remembering where i knew your username from and then once i heard that roger was probably heading to prison i though uhuh no way do i want to be associated with this mod team anymore so i quit it makes sense now that roger tapped you considering his friendship with erik and probably you as well from back in the dinosaur era if i suspected i might be going to prison id probably tap a known rather than leave the sub in the hands of the active mods who were afaik totally unknown to roger except thomas of course who operates under his real name id like to apologize for my distrust and extend an olive branch,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdnN1dzh3cGx2TXJ1MENwYVhPZHIyTk5xdWR3azgtMGdjcjVVemUyWWVLMVpaZDRFYTdiOFl5cmwzU3V0eGplWkRtakJGcUFnckJSVXJIcUhqSXFRSVE9PQ==

re cheaplightning > bch is ignored and censored by all the main stream media i post the news every week on <number> and growing platforms the highest reach is probably the bch page on coinmarketcap itself i have offered to submit the news to major crypto news sites as well but sadly no one is taking me up on the offer please help spread the weekly news by liking sharing subscribing to the weekly news on all these places snip while i do like the effort this isnt about people like you getting the word out it is about what the word is you cant disagree that our branding is indeed almost entirely for the insiders if it needs to be explained it doesnt make for very good branding it is too smart and uniquely hits the impossible line where the older generation actually knows the reference and at the same time it is a joke that is really only funny for the jonger generation if they know the reference and what op said,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvMGtoeHd4NUN5QmJpRWhjSUhZSWk4dFcwRjNnaEVrSnhTeGhsZ3g4VFZSN3F4UWFaUzVXNmpXU0VucExEcS1rQ2oxZU1QOTVBenhJUnRESGk5REhPOVE9PQ==

i echo what you said i could comment on some technical stuff being slightly off but that is irrelevant i agree with the sentiment and the intention behind your post but i think everyone that is really doing stuff in bitcoincash will agree with me that this is a permissionless community you dont have to ask for permission i agree with what you said but i have literally zero time to do any of this id help brainstorm throw some taglines in in <number> we tested mb blocks in <number> we made bitcoin cash remove all block scaling limits yet in the end someone needs to drive it i can applaud your efforts i can give some <number> minutes of my time but someone needs to drive it and you have the permission of the community to be that person i dont mean you jessquit personally i mean everyone that is passionate about bitcoincash everyone has permission to represent this community and go out and do cool promotion connect back and align for maximum impact but under no circumstances should you feel the need to wait for permission,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZW4yVV9ublF3OGhWclM1YzByX0ZOaHducjN2bzZJMjVZM2xMS0pod1p1NjVIcFY4aGNuaHRnSjMxWXIzZklEZk9rZGpFai15R19sbXpCV3FINlI0U0E9PQ==

i have a few issues with abla a lot of bch nodes are still running old versions of bitcoin cash node or bitcoin unlimited bitcoin unlimited only very very recently released a abla compatible version so if i suddenly manage to create the first mb block in a few weeks it could cause a unintentional hardfork for a large chunk of the bch nodes i think the block lookback period is too short i think that median fees should play a roll in raising the blocksize if you look at the bsv chain its several terabytes because its full of garbage nfts etc im happy abla has been implemented but it solves a problem that is so far into the future we might never reach it unfortunately currently bch still has less on chain transactions than btc has onchain,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwTlZwdXNGcjQ1b1FnOGpxcHBrMWxwLXVCMVk5MTBObGtuaDRnTHNVSTVYSUVIX3NsWW52TzB3Y2hTaXNGOVZuMDJ6RWw5VEFEZ1RRWnB3ZmZZR1UxYmc9PQ==
technically utxo commitments and the vm limits are both consensus changes and while we could live without improved vm limits not ideal at all living without utxo commitments will break idb as blocksizes and time grow i echo the sentiment that weve achieved a ton of great things and essentially solved scaling while also improving the scripting language to be on par or better than evm we should indeed be proud and we should indeed tell people but lets keep in mind that just because we dont know of any further limits doesnt mean that we wont find them as we scale up,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwRk5IZlU4LTVibG5ndTNaMmdOck9RSzc1bklCSWw3SWxTX1B5MmpTMjJWTVI1ZlJ0ZWpIN2ozYnhMWmRaRHEtNVlnWm1Idk93UjdsQ2h4UjNsRDRUZzJRR05ybmgwaF81enNHLWtFUnVwcVE9

in response to your questions <number> buying bch the well known exchanges are the easiest places to buy bch from although its not physical cash its easy to obtain you can check out <url><url> <url><url> and <url><url> im not sure about buying it with physical cash as the world is going cashless i dont think this option will be around for long <number> selling bch the main exchanges are probably your best bet for selling your bch i like coinbase binance and coinspot but there are many others a quick google search will usually find some sensible options selling with cash is a bit harder as i dont do this however if a friend wanted to buy some id sell some to them if you have customers paying in bch you could take cash sell them some bch and then accept any further payments via bch this way youre starting the cycle <number> how can customers buy bch again the main exchanges are easy to use you could also sell your bch or buy on behalf of your customers as mentioned above sell the bch to them even make <cur><number> on each transaction but only accept payments for other goods and services via bch <number> mobile selfcustodial wallets i use the selene wallet <url><url> i use it because its solely a wallet and doesnt try to sell me other services plus it supports the bitcoin cash community the bitcoincom<url> wallet is also okay you can buy bch through it so its convenient both are easy to set up <number> running a node im currently running bitcoin cash node v its exactly the same to set up as a bitcoin node you just need to open port <number> on your router and allow incoming connections other parameters within the config file can be adjusted but as youve already run a btc node youll be aware of all this visit <url><url> for more details <number> additional notes regarding specific details on how to perform each action you will need to check the mentioned exchanges for their registration steps i cant recall all the details off the top of my head the wallets simply require you to click install from the apple or android app store and include options to send or receive if you have used a bitcoin wallet before this should be second nature to you the same applies to running a node but ive linked the documentation should you need it if ive missed anything my apologies,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bW8tU0oxX0ZXeFQ5RUlWdkQxX3pPR3pCWGRRcTNOZTNVQWdmVTFmX3Axd1hWVFBjM3BKTUlzaVd3R3FhS3k4YXdyUWhvVlRZOWxQLVlaSmxfN0lHa1E9PQ==

buying using fiat without kyc is hard but i believe haveno is on its way to making this easier a lot of services like this have been shut down so its becoming more underground any kyc exchange will work though just pick one with the lowest fees spread etc there is changenowio where you can swap other coins for bch with no kyc a spv wallet is all you need for basic usage electron cash is great for desktop for mobile you may want a nicer looking user friendlier one like selene i havent compared all the mobile wallets myself yet if you really want to run a node you can pick a node implementation and run it like you already did before,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Q1lEQ0VEU093UHpVeDZ5REVWYjBVVzVwTWRCT0c5c3Q0Vk5GWGp0WmZ3cTdxQmNMWngtOTNkR0FGdmNCRnhWQk1fV0ZadlppR1RYWlBfdlEwa2xydnc9PQ==

everything in helpmecash<url> is kyc all the exchanges listed are kyc thats beats the purpose of decentralization that makes crypto almost pointless no one needs to know your face to trade you dont place a shop and ask everyone who walks in for their id and take a photo of them im going to think you want to use it against me or want to sell my identity and privacy in the black market which is exactly what happens theres onion sites selling kyc costumer data right now i have bought my own data in tor not everyone uses crypto yet if i cant use bch or xmr or any crypto not just everywhere but barely anywhere then its worthless and i wont use it even if fiat money is bad you dont give transition a chance the only chance you give it is under surveillance they log you into a system which makes it worse than sticking to governments cash,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SkVUYlRTWnJuWDBJN0duZ1NnSlllclRjUUxQMk5tSWtqNDBKSTU0MlhYNUJvdk1NZEpsajVkV1hSOFhtU0FXQ1hfc1p3ZjJ4elJCS0xQMUFxM0pxM3c9PQ==

the nonkyc fiatcrypto onoff ramps really dont exist at this point and im with youtheyre desperately needed localbitcoins was killed years ago and that was the best option around bitgree really is your best bet to convert fiat to bch without going through a centralized exchange the issue isnt bch the issue is the stranglehold and control tied to fiat currency unless you can find someone willing to tranfer you bch for cash youre going to have a hard time acquiring bch without some initial form of kyc now ifwhen you do acquire bch there is cashfusion through the stackwallet for anonymity so you can ultimately achieve your goal again this isnt an issue with bch or any other cryptothis is a controlledfiat issue unless youre offering a product or service and get paid pp in bch youre going to have to get creative to convert your fiat digital or paper into bch or any other crypto without kyc  if youre on tor as you claim ill bet you can get creative welcome to the fold btw once you do get some bch enjoy the experience of using pp electronic cash as it was intendedinstantly and at fractions of a cent,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4c05JNEE3ck1PMGR5VnR3SXpiZVdPYllMTmRkOTdJbHRLaU4tMWZlSlBRUTVENmNpQTVjZFVCWnpmdlY2TTlTTmxveUZxM01YUXNtaWlwZV85QUNrM1E9PQ==

kyc is required for exchanges to operate in many countries so your answer may depend on what county you live in but regardless its becoming increasingly difficult to get crypto without kyc and if you can find them youre gonna be paying a hefty fee to avoid kyc most people just have an account with coinbase or kraken is theyre the most reliable exchanges as far is getting fiat converted to crypto and viceaversa you can also earn and spend bch on bitgreecom but that takes kyc since we lost localcryptos and localmonerocom i dont know of how to reliably get crypto without kyc anymore,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4YTFtbFZmZlpYXzZ3VEQ4SG9wYTh5NGUtbTdQdGoyX2RlbjhzUVZoMXN6aEpkdmgzN1g3UGNrQ2hra1o4djNFaVJtRlAtYXFXalZPWnBSdWl3SUN3dUE9PQ==

>im here confused about how they created blockchains like monero and bch open source guis and clis for your nodes and wallets but no builtin dex exchanges i hear you but as stated above localbitcoins was a huge deal for years it was much easier to onboard from fiat to crypto without kyc in the past there is no bigger threat to fiat currency than decentralized selfcustodial bitcoincash the clowns running things have known this for a while but figured it would just be a flashinthepan that wouldnt amount to anything when the idiots realized that crypto actually had teeth they began paying attention and attackingshutting down all the nonkyc onoff ramps its about control its always about control and the only thing more easily controlled than fiat is cbdcs which is the ultimate goal we can beat them at their game but education and time are of the essence because things like monero zcash zano and cashfusion on bitcoincash exist im not too worried about onboarding via a cex that uses kyc once youre in crypto you can move swap bridge trade to any other crypto of your choice some easier than others of course or conveniently lose all your crypto in a boating accident if you so choose its not ideal but for nowthems the breaks i do remain hopeful that a nonkyc solution will emerge soon however your objections above are not a reason to opt out of bch in my opinion again youre going to run into the onboarding kyc issue with any crypto you just have to get creative or use the solutions currently available the more important issuefactor in my opinion is actually using bch as pp electronic cash once you have it making fiat go away by making it irrelevant is far more important than using nonkyc to convert your fiat to bch imho,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cWpndDFmQUxXbXF0NGxfc1VHMHZQc2ZCamo3OW9mb29yYThEUjVtMzJGVzlPbXBZZWh3VHNiWVBxdFBYcHQydV9lYzlvUEJXSUMyZTVZOFpMNy1OSUE9PQ==

best suggestion i can give you is to not cash out your crypto to fiat at all keep whatever amount of fiat you need in fiat and use your bch as pp electronic cash as intended use and replace this is how we make fiat irrelevant over time,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4N3NRSkVhZ0Q1QllVWjJadmp6cVlRakdmTFZmaHhDWXVFaFJJdHZuN2VIQngwblQ3eXZISm8ya0xGR3NPOGlidWdMTVViSmQ5NS1KNnpfTmtaSHdKN2c9PQ==
i disagree for fiat to become irrelevant you need to have a gate for the transition i cant find monero or bch to be worth as much if its not useful enough most online establishments dont even know bch not even some of the most freethinking ones including some of my personal cloud hosting services let alone physical shops bch needs us to be interested in it in the first place it needs possibilities if i know ill be able to swap it for anything else ill buy bch otherwise it might just not be worth it thats part of decentralization too not getting married to one currency only,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ajlrem1NWk1LSV9sMlFkUVhtU3JyS3d4T1BoYW9NTm5DY0lGTy1vWndOcnptVmxOb2lwYWZEMmhfNEo1WURyTWx5ZVBZc2g2aGE0c203XzB0U1RiVVE9PQ==

there are plenty of gates for the transitionjust currently none that are nonkyc i just completed a trip to europe and back using nothing but bch bch has more pp merchants than just about any other crypto yes it does vary by area but overall bch is the most accepted pp cryptocurrency out there very few merchants actually accept btc anymore due to confirmation times and ridiculous transaction fees btc has been defanged hijacked crippled and the current narrative for it as a digitalgoldsov is a complete bastardization of its original intended purpose as pp electronic cash you can buy as many prepaid visa or mastercards with bch via coinsbee as you want and spend them anywhere visamastercard are accepted many people live exclusively on bch this way to my knowledge there is a bch>xmr atomic swap in the works but you can also swap bch to multiple other cryptos on current cexs im with you use multiple coins if you deem it necessary i just think bch currently has the best shot at replacing fiat altogether which is why im a big proponent of it,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VkRGN1NuSmVsU2RyOV9XZmk0aW12anZxcGUwTjByQjFZekxramlMUTZ5cGhXbzFFRFkzT1FkVjRuajBRR2hvTnZaeTZ3bzhNcmcxM2ZZWWZOS1ZKNEE9PQ==

have you compared the outputs of your algorithm with the output of other aes encryptors you can probably use openssl command line and get similar results cryptography is super hard its very easy to get things wrong therefore doing cryptography on your own is dangerous ps btw what is the advantage of using your javascript app comparing to just booting up airgapped ubuntu livecd and using something like openssl gpg cryptsetup or even veracrypt from command line,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEaVNIaGdkWnpyaHV0d3VILW0wTFdsQXZ5cFhHVE16cDdobjB1eTdqS3RHN01WcXpCellrQVBRajBmUGkxTThjbDk5dzBnaFdBQ0ZQeXNhNUVTU3k3d0Z5U0EycUJvUExFOXE0Qnk5T1ZSaTg9

it is possible ogs may swap their btc distribution for bch at a ~<number><number> ratio however some of the mtgox holders are in desperate need of cash and may sell all their btc and bch holdings as soon as they are distributed also there are some maxis who obviously will immediately sell as well one of the reasons we see high volumes in <number> is because maxis sold off all their bch and have no exposure to it anymore definitely a good time for some whales who were looking to buy in because usually the orderbooks on many exchanges are quite scarce without pushing the price up a lot,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEYmdJWGtMXzNGdzdkdVh6ejBXSF84MHo3R2hhZFZPZEZjalViVkpDVDNscEVOdTh1RnRFOEszdi1NSUxTR3BOWnFabWtxMzRTRWlGSnlVV0FOOThYVkE9PQ==

bch is the better bitcoin try on chain transactions for yourself and compare the fees and speed to btc we have a long way to go for adoption but i believe this is the bitcoin that was envisioned in the beginning i have so much conviction after doing s of hours research and trying both coins in self custody that i sold my btc and put it all and then some into bch rbitcoin is about as toxic as rbuttcoin lol getting kicked out has been enlightening if you want to learn more i would say the best bang for your buck is hijacking bitcoin by roger ver the man is extremely knowledgeable and has been around since before the blocksize wars for bch ta i enjoy czar gets crypto on youtube he also has a discord that he links on his channel lots of info and banter on there shout out to the dragon riders and the house of the dragon best of luck and enjoy your journey with bch ps this reddit has a ton of knowledge dig through some of the older posts as there is a great group of guys here who have shared a crazy amount of insight over the years,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEM0Jab2ZjU3pvSkFqdExsTWtSSmMxa1ZJQ3R3MGFvb2V6enlIeDUyMHpTaUFRWFJHYXlPZmQ0Skw3aGp4VEh6Vi15M1VUSVYtOE5kdGtnRy1ZVEVkOVpZRXZDUXIyZFhYZkp6SmVWR1drS289

scarcity doesnt sound like enough to make value to a lot of people but what people dont get is that this is digital scarcity everything else digital can be replicated a lot of things just because of copy and paste which we all know but if we intersect digital and scarcity we have something extremely powerful it doesnt need to help fix your cavities or lubricate an engine scarcity in other objects exist but not such that you can send it across the globe instantly those features are the main parts of what this tech is about and it will go far it is a technology that humankind absolutely needed to move forward into a better future and more people will become aware of that fact over time,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbC1wR0toS0hfYWtzUGdKaFU0LTZvMW5QSERpcG9ZOEx2YzhZbldaZFk1VU8tWnZQbmVlRGdLRWlKT05pZDNfd0Y4Qm90OG1BRTJVRXVITzE1bmRDZnp2T0Y1V2xPZ3JHeUJ3dndWeU5vLVk9

bitcoin cash definately has a future and from a technical standpoint it is already today very impressive but as you have noticed this coin like most others is traded primarily for speculative benefit and as such it moves up and down more based on speculative bias than it does on its underlying utility i would argue though that the underlying utility provides a floor under which price will not stay very long and that floor has been increasing over the last couple years and given the people involved and the quality of their proposals for how to move forward i am optimistic that bitcoin cash will be seen in the top<number> for a long time now if you are looking for financial advice about what to do with your speculation though i have nothing to offer you will need to do your own research to determine what the true value of the coin is and then take actions accordingly,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNESF9zVlJvXzNEQkJpUWVrRC1uS1lUNnBvNkN2TjY0d1YzZHQ5R0hmZGtPVW9yN0Q4dGMyLTJRMXNTdktQSS12UjFvOVk5bnRLS2VEUDNwRlFLZDdzaFI1NjF4MVowWmgyZGVGcWdmT1VQdmM9

i dont quite understand the buy and hold approach of any crypto the idea is to get people to start using this thing as pp cash that means you spend it you exchange it for goods you want it to be the primary measurement of value you want vendors to use it price goods and services with it you want its value to be the primary measure of stability if a vendors all over the world paying <number> transaction fees with credit card processor ultimately transferring that expense to you as the customer wouldnt there be incentive to switch if something could process your transactions for <number> fee while leaving the rest of the funds in a stable state and you could pay other vendors you depend on it with then weve arrived at utility and merit bch can do this btc seems uninterested but its code afterall and code can be changed currently people continue to think in dollars with all of their crypto at some point without any practical utility all of it is going to fizzle out because the asymmetric return potential will be diminished to the point that is less attractive than and other real productive asset with utility that day approaches if you want to buy and hold something that has virtually no utility for the sole purpose of hoping just to get rich quick btc seems to be better positioned but if you want to actually use this stuff to transact for everything like cash is today without the inflation issue bch seems to better positioned i have no interest in owning btc bch is a different story but i want to be able to easily buy things with it,r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFY1lYaG5laE54QjRncXNoaWM0VmtjU2VFZ0R2ZjNNUEVsY3k2cGtmLTRuRmVHNnJmbmd6TERRTWh4UXlNTGM1SWFtQ20zVWNSN0tDaGVOS0VSUXF6ZWc9PQ==
