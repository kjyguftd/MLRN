not sure why they keep receiving a fraction of the btc back after sending them out each day but the total balance keeps trending down at the end of each day its possible they havent been sold yet but at the very least once the balance in their wallet hits zero it will calm fud and those tens of thousands of btc germany is supposedly selling will be no different from the other <number> million btc sitting on exchanges what we know for certain is spot etfs bought <cur><number> million worth of btc in the past <number> trading days or around k btc yet price hasnt moved much in the past week so theres definitely some serious selling going on outside of spot etfs and germany is potentially a large contributor to that sell pressure since we can see tens of thousands of btc have left their wallet in the past week,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcG4tUEpCOW5jTXJCcG5tb0ZEZlgyVXpJdDNrTlJ2emZmTGJabkZpVmx0UWY1MU04WVJNLWJxZkxPSFEtVEFTVTRIcXQ5N1JGOVhVZ3J1NVFLVDM2V2c9PQ==
then wheres the insane volume on exchanges with all this extra activity its not happening on exchanges so it has to be otc which no one has records of and getting k btc back to the wallet isnt a fraction you send k btc and pull k back why is it just sitting there to be withdrawn fact is its all speculation i am certain some of it has been sold but like a few weeks ago when germany dumped k btc on exchanges it dumped the price of btc <number>k and now k btc have been sold and we ranging etfs are buying otc so wheres the fucking volume i keep getting down voted for saying these things but i go buy facts not speculation and i cant find proof anything happen except a circle joke of tweets and crypto news sites speculating that transfers on the blockchain <number> mean the btc was sold ignore the clawbacks from exchanges etc something isnt adding up,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTmlIMjA2akl1T0d3VXZTZTFXeWZoREVtclcwbEJXZHJXQ3pUbFNhZlBHbEoyRzBQbG9YS1lVYmFwenhGTXp6aVlxMnhjZ1ZYYkhhY1I3Tms0aFVYclE9PQ==

since ive started following they are selling the coins between ~ <number><number> <number><number> utc coins sent to otc desk are never coming back from what that im gathering only coins sent to exchanges are coming back its possible they arent twapvwaping the coins but are just using regular market and limit orders its probable that they are using limit orders that dont get hit and then they send the coins back to their address now about the volumes your assumption that dumping of coins will result in much higher volume is probably incorrect high volume days are correlated with high volatility i would argue that since we hit local bottom they caused a decrease on volatility as they sold into the correction this is also evidenced by the etf showing high inflows people were buying the dip and the germans selling into it lowered the volatility,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZFVrTHlyc2FtaEsxTDlRS2RXeWkwMHpvMXVEeXVoem1BWWt5RHpDNTRIYkVfVHFrcVBrQlZOTXBhRVZiYm52SDVlOXpkUzZBbTFOdVRJMTJfMnFxM2c9PQ==

dude fact is their address has gone from holding k btc to <number> so even if some of the coins they sent out today wind up coming back to that address lets say like <number>k thats still a <number>k = <number> reduction in their holdings of course to your point just because those coins arent sitting in that address doesnt necessarily mean all those coins have been sold but do you really think theyre going to leave tens of thousands of coins sitting on exchanges for any extended period of time that would be wildly imprudent of any governmental agency the most logical explanation is that they send a certain amount to the exchanges and if the exchanges are unable to move all of those coins in a given day they send the leftover back to the government so while we cant be sure i think its reasonably fair to assume that virtually all these coins have been offloaded already,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSGVVMTNMbm9MNVVXLWM5VXRFbVVIT2g3MVRORWtpd3RvazBFa0xsV3MtMUJCSkRWZFl3VDA1Z2Rha0t4YkpJNlFNb3d1b2c3YU8wYUktdHctSk5lV1dlNTRnTXR4T2dhdkIxMmFBVDg4X3c9

except theres nothing to suggest an imminent stock market collapse and besides is there really any doubt that the fed wont step in and cut rates the moment things start to look ugly they can never resist playing hero by turning the liquidity spigot back on also everyone reflexively assumes that if stocks go down btc must too and sure in the case of some true global crisis everything will shit the bed at the same time but barring any such huge crisis i think what were more likely to see is a more benign modest drawdown of the stock marketlike <number>just to cool off an overheating market in which case i think its far from a given that btc must go down as well its entirely possible that btc just frontran the correction and may well just go sideways while stocks correct and again if stocks retreat more meaningfully eg <number><number> fed daddy jpowell will just ride to the rescue,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRXBMSGJnek5EY0NrQjNDUGpESHczWEZCNGRDbGh3eFRyM0s0V0JZbWQxdkh1UDNWU3NTRDNGaHp0cGMwNHgtMC1RSDVFTmRPelN2RllTXzhFWi1RcTI5czhVMmNkZXN6OWUwdXhOc3NFSkE9

because its exchange based you cant see k coins going to kraken and assume that wont cause the price to trend down on kraken this activates bots etc if its all bought up the volume should be way higher then <number> extra but weve seen lower volume this week it just doesnt add up dude not to mention we are below the <number> ema which is acting as resistance below <number>k this added sell pressure plus the mtgox coins should have us testing k ive resisted building big trades and been scalp shorting this below the <number> but something in my head after <number> years trading these markets doesnt add up i could be wrong which is why i am posting and what ive learned is i am usually the outlier but my pl speaks for its self and otc desks dont just let you withdraw at a whim have you dealt with them i use to own a mining operation and unless it changed very drastically its very different then placing market or limit orders on an exchange anywho i could be wrong theres a reason why the price is ranging here that i cant figure and i expect this weekend to trend upward and test the <number> and if we break above it i do plan on longing the fuck out of it i did reload some spot at <number>k after selling some at <number>k,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNlBFb3dCUUI0ZzlxY0VHbDBYRDRwUUplUFFQRGFsZ0Vjeko3aS1jRkdEdEtvMTdfcHp3cUVQajdlVC1ZRWZRbmRpcGlxcHZwa2lLMzVxUzhXMmtUYnc9PQ==

k gox vs k germany so less than x but from my understanding only k of the total k gox coins are being distributed over the next few months so really only like a x and mind you those gox coins may seemingly get disbursed in chunks between now and the end of october vs the german coins getting dumped basically all in one week,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRk1CV0k1MkpoMmVUQjlyREVueldFRnZFS2lNWUNnZnFPZXBWY3N2b2JmMHBYbVJlbXZJRjBHNDVNd25OOTFCbzE5NVFSTkhFeWpzN0UtYTNmYW1aaGtnWFp6RnBWOHZOcG5SRzVfZkQ0SWM9

someone check my math but <number> btc <number> min = <number> btc made each week <number> mm average etf inflows day since etf launch = <number> mm inflows in a week of trading so if we look at inflows vs print rate were averaging roughly k dollars in per coin minted certainly if this continues the price cant stay below k ea for much longer,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZU8tQi1wY3RRdzYtSWg3dEVEYmRPcXNMeDlUR2F4Sk90N1RZeFNDMUtYSjI0ak93eVM1Ui1Cc0JScXE0U3liLWFqMG5yenF4T25HQTk0QXV3bnFFQUE9PQ==

at this point i think its neutral i mean at most youre just giving up the benefit of these coins having been locked up for so long which bitcoin benefited from the point where people actually care about gox has long passed,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZGFmY0RvSzQxdVM4Tjk2cWExZE1JdWk5Zk4tMHljSXJtbW53YldIUjljd0Vma2lfdjhTcC1hRXNNMkRqS3FfWW5ObmRuZGg0dGpQX1d4YlhRZ1dZVkE9PQ==
mt gox has k btc<url> but is the k being disbursed all at once or over a longer timeframe also what percentage of the k actually ends up getting sold immediately upon receipt to trigger a taxable event germany dumped <number>k btc in the span of a single week thats thousands of btc being sold every single day nonstop for a week yet price never fell below <cur>k while mt gox payouts could theoretically end up resulting in more selling pressure within the same timeframe as what we just experienced with germany its unlikely to be that severe if you are not already fully allocated take advantage of buying while fud from my gox is heightened as their wallet gets depleted when we fail to reach a lower low compared to what we saw with germany because sell pressure will likely not be as extreme despite the sizable disbursements btc is going to rip much higher bullish,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncFVtRjFRYWZfT09TZ3JVdGVqS0ZmWUtzODBDTUVMcTBfSWhfNXFVRk8xTjNEZTEwdU94LVdFN2Q1d24tUVB2TmU3ZWl0Y2hPeUlJMGxKVnRILTU3c0E9PQ==

there will be a bunch that is sold for cash which i think happens after the btcbch disbursement so expect another forced sale at some future point note there was cash sales before as well but there is a second amount to come the registered exchanges have <number> days to split their allocation up once it hits them but kraken has stated they will be doing it as soon as they can and indeed this is their latest response here<url> which indcates they have recieved their allocation and will be doing it in <number><number> days,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndUJCU1owcnM0VWEtaHFySHpLNGctM2JocmRXeFNmcDhnUFZmWnJZbUp5aHkwTlZSNDhYZlRlekRqYkk5R2VaWWVVYXhSYm4xTWN5ajJxcE1uWDRmZ2c9PQ==

what percentage of the k btc does that end up being though in this initial disbursement and after accounts get credited in <number><number> days what percentage of that btc is actually sold immediately upon receipt to trigger a taxable event suppose the k btc that moved earlier today ends up being how much the initial disbursement is for <number>k btc would be <number> of that initial disbursement meaning if the initial disbursement does in fact end up being k btc <number> of those holdings would need to be sold immediately upon receipt triggering a taxable event just to achieve equivalent levels of selling pressure that we saw from germany while mt gox payouts could theoretically end up resulting in more selling pressure within the same timeframe as what we just experienced with germany its unlikely to be that severe,r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVzVMX3ZxMnRkWGdTUG5rSG4wNGtrX1FxXzBId2tleENVcktCTHZsWmR1TkhfaTBVOU5IY3pVdTNyUVBGUXRKQWJyUWxuUHJ6RGdmcThub2ZvQzhKV2c9PQ==
