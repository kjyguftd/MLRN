you pay more for streams than spotify pays you because i dont think spotify has a fixed value they pay per stream at least for small artists spotify are also very keen to ban content that makes them lose money a very controversial change i remember them talking about banning lowfi music and whitenoise stuff as these are mostly uploaded by the same artists to make money by creating big playlists promoting them and putting their songs in a loop ig if you have a botnet of the size that would be worth botting streams you can do a lot of other things that could make you a lot more money,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPMTJnQnlJNVVuUEtDNGltTkJqanREY3VoSDRtQ013Mm9Wc2RGbk1zRjVJNXZNV1otbW5TQ2tLUGh3ckFfQ1RiZVNhaDZvaUFpN2tPa2ZvVGM5TUlHaFE9PQ==

i mean one were not going to help you break the law and two are you new to the arcade scene like <number> of games out there are programmed with specific payout rules even ones that dont award physical prizes but especially ones that do even if you could change the payout odds remotely you have to keep in mind that isnt a magic next attempt wins <number> button all it usually does is tell the machine that from this point on its allowed to let people win but you still have to have the skill or potentially just luck to win regardless i get why you dont like it but even if you could hack the machines youre making a pointless effort not only are you probably going to get caught and end up in legal trouble at some point but in the end that doesnt really accomplish anything if you want to make a difference spend your time making videos or social media posts teaching people how these machines are rigged against them winning or try to lobby your government for changes that would require these machines to be more upfront on the odds even then you have to realize that end of the day human nature is that even when they know its rigged people will still play anyway if that wasnt the case casinos and carnival games wouldnt exist,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQNGx5eDNjMkdNVmE0U2NGRm1mbS1vbmxoZmQxMFMyNFhOdDlDMnlGLXk3azVTUXNNbmF1UzU1cUl1R0NIQUFxaXZjSUd5bWQ2dE5yVVNpeHlSMGVtOXc9PQ==

just learn how different operating systems work youll pick up with c and python easily since you already have enough knowledge at the development end just focus on os cpu architecture and bit of networking if malware is your priority try improving your skills on c vbs javascript python and finally few bits of assembly these are the most common languages preferred by other malware devs once you know how to use these tools your next step will be actually making and obfuscating malwares while obfuscating you will have to learn about av evasion methods and craft your payload for specific cases this part is called resource development apart from resource development having knowledge of buffer overflows and exploit development can sometimes be helpful special tip just dont give up and everything will be fine happy hacking,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdmQ5LVhQOUE0ZHh4eU5KRjNUUHNnQ2JySzRRUVBqUTJzMEJwZndzeGlZQmItVGc2RVotOHlmMnRXdkhGV3VhMndHeDAxMmx3SGk5TGJlcHZ3TDVKVTM0N1NmZE00NUVZa2lqTFBSX014aE09

the best way to get caught with it is to put it on a hacked server hackers pay for legit services all the time especially servers they just use fake data and pay in a way that cant be traced back to them for most causes hacked accounts can be used but hosting is critical infrastructure you dont want to jeopardize some operation because your hosting account suddenly gets suspended for some reason,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZU9mQXM4WHFpc3B4MUlBX0FjTndQR2Vwb2VVcjRTT3g1SThTZVBiMklsT1hFekFJSUVCeThYbXZJcFBsZVA0WHRzY3BqV3NRY05PMGhaSVBDR1RNdnFIaVA2MXJFR0NGYngxNjM1NlFCc1E9

first understand why things get detected it mostly breaks down to <number> areas signatures and heuristics in older avs you just had to worry about signature detection but as time went on technology improved and now you gotta worry about detecting behavior an unknown file that acts weird ie open sockets to weird domains performing discovery commands using abnormal system resources etc is gonna get caught eventually this is why we go fileless and just take over running processes altogether its much harder to detect since it blends into the background this should be enough to get past a regular home users antivirus but for a company with a defenseindepth security thats another question there are different ways to take over legit processes like process hallowing dll injections thread execution hijacking etc they all do the same thing but in different ways for the most part it involves finding a legit process with nt authoritysystem privileges reallocating memory inside the process then injecting your own code read up on memory injection techniques for the nitty gritty but this is roughly how you might evade antivirus software,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ0l6bXZJdk0wem0zS0daWXVmQlA4UVpfcms3RzlvNzl6LTMwc1dad3M1MGxDd1RWR2I5NUhsczhWODZDTUlOUGFFd2Y1VFNrVE12dFFlTmhQSXlzTkE9PQ==

you should probably make your own thread for these types of questions but i will be happy to answer them yes python can absolutely perform process hollowing if you are unfamiliar with the ctypes builtin one of its functionalities lets you use the windows api i dont remember all the api calls offhand but you can certainly call createprocessa virtualallocex readwriteprocessmemory and getsetthreadcontext from within python as for write dlls im not sure what you mean yes python can modify and write files to disk it can also modify running process memory as well if you meant use dlls the answer is also yes a simple example to call the messagebox export from userdll would be ctypeswindllusermessageboxw<number> world hello <number>,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYm4xM1ktWHVMR0hOVFlBa1k3ano4aGhSX1U4RzRSdHBJNDdGcGM2T2hNazBFOHZIWU5yeVJ5VUxmMUNHRHNReU9TUkMyb0ZpZU51bkdFcnU3RVQzS2c9PQ==

the answer for this is sorta dependent on who you are for instance if you were a corporation with an edr at your disposal youd probably get an alert with all the details that this was popping off the detection will tell you the time it happened the user running the command what process they took over and any embedded commands in the process from there youd have a good idea where to look in which case id tell you to isolate the affected host stop the process from running disable the user that ran the command find the root cause of the infected process through various threat hunting techniques and mitigate from there but if you were a home user then that answer is entirely different home users dont have siems intrusion prevention systems edrs or other alerting methods to even be notified that something is going on to begin with most people facing these attacks probably wouldnt even know until after the fact that something even happened but if you were suspicious of a process id look into velociraptor by rapid its a forensicir open source software that lets you perform threat hunts on your own hosts without the need of an edr plus its free,r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV1JFSVAxdlZVNUlva09yeXhHR1JlbUZzZFlvcmhudUtyeGJJeXdHN2MzOFF6Q2xmb2VBdXBkcFg5dGNtMVRvaHMyZnpLQ1IzRVgxQ01rME05TVlUSVE9PQ==
