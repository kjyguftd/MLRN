dcg committed fraud and used genesis an insolvent company to solicit loans from unsuspecting victims then when the company was shown to be insolvent dcg applied to pay customers back only a fraction of their assets and then keep a large amount of the customer assets for themselves the dcg company is pure evil thankfully a judge denied their criminal requests and ruled that assets will go to customers the various law enforcement agencies all agreed to allow customers to receive their assets back as well before they attempt to get their fines from genesisdcg which was very uplifting to see as well,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVGJKUmlrQi1La1pITE5jc3JaQ0dYeksyTHhwM1QzcUZzX05nTXZnYlhYSXp6LVVKdUdhQUNpZ09IRVV3cUEzaHRydWxiR212SEdvLTlieTl5UXF4a1E9PQ==

sure i agree with that thought there is nothing nefarious hidden or deceptive about what btc is or how it operates it is possible for someone to buy btc not knowing what it is or where the price comes from but any informed buyer that is speculating on the price long term knows that the price is the result of others buying it in the future and nothing else i think everyone in the world can know exactly what btc is and how it works with virtually no interest in economic transactions and i still think it is in a better position to be the largest market cap coin with continual growth both in nominal and real terms thought under performing the market a pure fixed supply entity which has its pricepurchasing power exclusively determined by ponzi mechanics is desirable to people and it is not doomed to collapse like an actual ponzi scheme though most people will ultimately end up with a loss or lower than market returns,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZEtsLWRvSjBWSDJyeGMwRjB0aGpNOWpReWZYT2pJZlJMZ2UxQzZxcW8xMUtMaXF1NDAzc0FLQWJHeGtQSmFYMWt1RlFDME94X2ExZ3ZPOGxLcjJWUVE9PQ==

the main disadvantage imo is that it is possible to decrease decentralizion due to a much larger storage requirement due to the larger block size limit this assumes waay more transactions than bch sees if btc had greatly increased its block size how many years before the average person couldnt afford the storage for a node it could have been several terabytes by now this is not a big risk for btc because storage is getting cheaper faster than it can grow,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcGYwdFE5VWlIV21KY2VDbFY0OE5wOTZOYXZIZ28wUnV1MW5VM3o0TjRsNmxVQ0RKcUtWZUNqZXpNbllZeE1Yd1YwclNCS0I0V1FlVTNicXlVVGdUb2c9PQ==
bch solved the existing limit back when it was created it has even more capacity now if adoption and use keeps growing slowly this new limit currently estimated to be around mb blocks edit looks like some say the current limit is somewhere between mb and gb but that is still a limit should be enough for years of growth that said there is a limit and the original scaling dream of bitcoin as cash for the world is not solved bch can not serve the people of the world yet it is limited and can not go viral and fulfill the dream yet until it can it wont i believe solving the scaling limitation would make viral growth both possible and likely but only when we truly do solve it tell that truth and people believe in bitcoin bch again pretending we solved the limitation only makes it harder to be believed when we really do solve it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOTJ2NV9qSVVQbkV3cU5aY1UzVE9xNXFCUkNBS2pkWWJUZzN0UWRqcEVaSnlfbjdlSkNVXy1IUGxCczd3NDhoeWNZLTBXNnpsVVlmTkVodDVpWFJJOEE9PQ==

the eth people spent a very short time on state channels before realizing that they are bullshit they used sidechains to hold themselves over for a while now they are already past sidechains and focusing on rollups i get that some people want to do layers but the bitcoin people are really behind the curve on that right now they are stuck on the shittiest possible second layer and they are just barely transitioning to one that is slightly less shitty but still not nearly good enough and none of this is even necessary yet because they have too much untapped headroom on l,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZEREOHBhNFJocnZWWWJJdDZDaVA1LXViUEdKelNIZU5zZGNUZHNESndla3gzWUhVcG5yb2hfWEIzcFRINmpoS2F2aGRiR0dEZnJNUjJsVVo1bWRiUGR3VTBSczlZaDFVVmdPc3dvaG9leVU9

they will know the ip as you will be hitting an api to connect to the actual blockchain so whatever party infura etc can see ips in their logs if they want too i dont know if they store them if you want a full proof system then download the original wallet for that crypto from their websitegithub and sync it to the blockchain using a vpn you never know what rd party apps can do behind the scene,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTamliZDlDZ2NTaFhjRGk0SUkxTnZrQU0tVDZfbENEOVF5dXJOU1E1MHNOdEl0MFRIeklyOXVtVm8wUGFUNlNGUTB2YXhuZmVrTTRsSG1vLWN3UU50Vnc9PQ==
the is a good question ok so there is the software download itself tons of people download these things and there is a good chance you havent even generated the wallet yet when you download so yeah your ip might in some download logs somewhere but that doesnt relate your ip to a wallet then you run the software and the software generates a wallet or you load a seed or whatever then it generates the addresses and needs to check with online servers to get the balance of your addresses this is where your ip and wallet can be related basically there are four flavors of servers that you could hit private ones by the makers of the software in question they will know your wallet and ip and might keep it private might sell it to partners etc public ones run by blockchain intelligence companies that exist to store big databases of ips and addresses they then sell or make available this data to partners and customers there are a lot of these if the software connects to a random server from a big list you are probably hitting one of these public ones run by community members who get it they dont even record the data for who is doing what but you cant really tell them apart from the above ones private server that you run yourself and take the time to configure the software to use short version shit show,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWUw3ZWVmb1pZVDNYc3dIcGNzbXktdUNwRlY4NDNDNE15dE5ObGx3eWptTTJHSHdOR2o5SXlmQm5FalRiNW5qVlBNNzJURHVRTWMzaThDb2hvUHNxbmc9PQ==

you are right on the money always prioritize open source wallets by community devs i would just also add in using tor whenever possible as well the best wallets incorporate it even some on mobile vpn + tor + cashfusion = good luck tracking that bitcoin cash i think many people trust wallet devs more than they should by prioritizing convenience over privacy the more often you use cashfusion vpns tor open source technology the better privacy that you and others using those tools will have i would also recommend researching and using shielded zcash monero as both are great options as electronic cash with top tier privacy technology,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNW9aYTk5Mkw0NFdZLWI0b0xHUUktTFJaWTR6QV9lU1o0VXJlUVI3eWRXLXBEN2RwUUxGaTlIMzRIQS1wdGVGd19BSTQ3Zm4xaGl3NkdCcDd3SUdOSUNzWkM3OGkycFE4Sm1XUDR3cE1wR0U9
> you are correct and your line of thinking is correct > > > you are correct to bang on you are correct that the utxo set already contains the relevant transactions i believe my assesment was correct but i dont have intimate knowledge of the nuts and bolts of how things work i only have a mildly technical overview so when tom says you need to walk the chain of transactions to rebuild the wallet i listen though i have not seen a good reason why my bloom like filter suggestion<url> could not work perhaps <number> you could not make a bloom filter specific enough to cover hundreds of billions of addresses extreme adoption <number> if you could it would be too large to be practical for mobile users <number> the cost to check all your possible transactions would be prohibitive on a mobile device moving to even thinner ice than the usual i think the above method wouldnt be able to find multisigs unless they were marked in some way or any non standard address personally i see mundane day to day transactions happening on second layers this would presumably keep the search space for possible outputs down to a manageable size for most users and in the future if all else fails the brute force method of downloading complete list of current addresses for each utxo low tb and generating the first billion wallet address ~gb may well be practical and if all else fails paying someone to do it for you which would you prefer to loose your wealth or privacy at scale i imagine it could be relatively cheap walking the tbs of utxo with sorted lists of <number>s of users by then it possibly could all fit in ram for a power user offering the rebuild service as a business > my question is for you and tom isnt it ultimately the local users responsibility to know the addresses they care about i would say so perhaps a wallet saves a snapshot of its own utxos encrypted with the seed phrase in the cloud storage perhaps provided by wallet or just numbered list of what wallet addresses are live though tom seemed at least partially to be against this as he argued one could have <number> live wallets with the same seed<url> and one wallet could not know what utxos the other wallet had spent for me this does not seem to fit with the overwhelming use case of pp cash if uthomaszander is correct and we need to keep all the legacy data to rebuild wallets from scratch i may be misrepresenting him in this regard this does not seem very scaleable to me,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZy1WaWdzc0d4RWRuN1E5TWwyOFF4em9HUFdqdHJoUU5ucUg4eXZMNkx6TFBpVFhCVjc1bWhadFdSNTUtUVVuczBYaVNkc1NGQl9raklLUGQyZnlTLXc9PQ==
that is the antibitcoindream claim many fall for it sadly too many the truth is that no bitcoin can scale up to serve the world yet pretending it does not matter because adoption proves the world is not interested in a working pp cash for the worlds people is disingenuous or mistaken of course it does sound reasonable if repeated often enough,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTekRxTWJhbUtDS21NSWR2akNhV2kybVNUMUlXVWthQXFFT3hHSjBLQmxrT0dCSnQydE1waUt3WUplWVY5cXhjeGY0ejVhNDk2UEhKQ0l0NEJyaE1iS1E9PQ==
imagine not even needing the utxo set when you receive a transaction you can just check the latest global state root which is basically a hash of a recursive zk proof that the entire chain is valid and you can use information from the transaction to construct a proof that the transaction itself is valid and know if its already been included in the current state root that said im super excited for utxo commitments this is my first time hearing about them but that absolutely does sound like an awesome step most ls are pretty fucked at the moment mostly thinking in terms of eth ls mostly due to centralized sequencing even ls in their final form the users will be at the mercy of the sequencing mechanism and the data availability mechanism but even then users will still be able to get their money out thought it might some time and high fees to do it the ultimate goal of ethereum is to take one of these l technologies that are being deployed and enshrining it on l then rebasing the entire network to be an l rollup so yes in that sense it would all just be an l,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaU9aNVRjLUFmVjNMOVBBbm5uVE1mOUItZFFtRG9TeGRuWXZBanFBakp1aFJnX0ZKWWRnamRFTlNBQ1BNT043Y1VXY1drd0ZsNFY4RlVzbW9EdXJYcXc9PQ==
he makes a lot of good points but he also makes some bad arguments im not all the way through the book yet but these are the ones that jumped out at me the most so far <number> he constantly uses cash to be synonymous with arbitrarily small payments he makes the argument that in the early days the digital gold narrative was about how bitcoin could not be debased but that later shifted to being a store of value and that latter narative is at odds with bitcoin being digital cash because cash by his definition means small payments he then goes on to cite the many times satoshi used the term cash and the fact that he never once used the term store of value all of which is true but all of this is assuming satoshi was using cash in the same way roger is i think that what satoshi meant by calling bitcoin digital cash was that it could be used as a final settlement without any third parties similar to cash i dont think his use of the word cash has anything to do with payment size although satoshi does talk about the possibilities of using bitcoin for small payments i dont see any connection between that and the term cash in fact that would be a poor comparison to physical cash because small transactions is not a strength of physical cash when you consider the cost of producing distributing and replacing physical cash <number> i know this one will not br taken well here in this sub but ill say it anyways hes dead wrong about full nodes in his thought experiment where <number> of miners fork into a new chain and <number> of full nodes stay in the old chain it is true that the latter chain with <number> miners would grind to a halt but its also true that the former would being mining virtually empty blocks since miners contribute very few transactions to the mempool both chains would be essentially useless at the time of the split and either one could end up being considered the real chain depending on the details of why the chain split and how the users on both sides perceive it overall its a very interesting read and im enjoying getting a new perspective on the blocksize wars i was glad to see roger on the btctkvr podcast it makes me hopeful we may move back to a single protocol sometime in the future cheers,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTU3NGTjhTQUhBN29uS1hBMzhFbG1QUFN1a3JLM1cyNUNtWkRKQlZWa2h2eWR3SGpNMEx3M2J1Nng5UFRWMnRLcmJKdHZaUHRZWTBuVU5IQXV4dUtjSUE9PQ==

cryptocurrency wallets generally are anonymous in the sense that you dont need a government id to create one people forget how revolutionary this is but <number> years ago it was basically impossible to send money over the internet without a government id using cryptocurrency doesnt give you magical invisibility to police powers or something usually its quite the opposite anywho just download the software with tor or something the wallet downloads arent really the hard part of crypto opsec usually sending transactions to an rpc provider and then inputoutput hygiene is what gets people,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVXBseUl3SEFTakpHX29OTEU0OWdOQkR3dUtIMENwZXMzdWJPdE9oSG9xNkJvdUgwSlZuTG9qaG1aczJXVXM2WU1oTUsxYzA0dFVTaC1XVC0wdDNsV1E9PQ==

some wallet software can be configured to use tor or to use a socks proxy like tor in which case that is very good protection the question of which wallets then leads to the question of for which coin basically one thing i look for is does it let you change the server the wallet uses for information,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdlA5Q1hQM0hFYkdNWDBlc3VDZ0lFUnZhSWtiVFNxZ0ZZS2pTMXZlbTVWVXpuOGJ1MHpNMlZKdUdLUl80a3BkLUlBOGFoMktuVzNPNXNJSVJxaUVBWEE9PQ==
wow so does that mean when simply logging into the wallet its effective presumably that takes setup that means the first login had no configuration to tor edit is there a wallet youd recommend that has this built in,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRy1zVVo3Sk43UjlJWUhubFUyVjREWWw1bU0yZnhYNlhCdk0xUVlVa2trUVNHV3VoVUtvSmpvOGtzTlpGeDRzTTFSMGpMZG9NNkJyOTJ2aUxFbFNQZjlXek5qRVdjbEJ4alBaMEhoeXV2T2M9
yep so far downloaded on tor open the wallet connected to vpn however some really interesting points above by ufireduck who mentioned that some wallet software can be configured to use tor but im not sure how that works,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSUhweWJfcWtvRHk2X2w0bXk3OWZSajg0Ym1aZklxMk5JTGwyM3NCZk9ueDBhZTk5VmZMbXhBMVA5ZVgyY3dIVEd0eTBDcTJ1d1pvX0p4eklvMXR2VXV0cmo2VUZJTmJTQ0ZBSy00bGlRdnc9
there is no real standard definition for login when related to wallet software so im not going to use that term when you load a wallet the software will generally immediately connect to remote servers to check the balances and history of addresses in that wallet this happens before you have any funds on the wallet before you make any transactions some actually ask if you want to use a proxy configuration before they do this i seem to recall one of the monero wallets doing this but yeah creating a wallet and running with default settings will usually result in your ip and addresses being logged by someone somewhere,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaUR0bVVoTkwwMFhFWVhFa3hRQ1JoaXB0dFdyWU1aOHRNblQtT3lUM292N0RvZUlDaDhaV1QxeDRPTmk5ekRqeEw1V19ka2hXRVFlcnFsZDFzZU5TNGc9PQ==

bch hasnt solved scaling its only out competed btc scaling wise a true solution would eliminate block sizes altogether and the block limit would become the emergent limit of the time it takes transactions to propagate the network within the block time this would require eliminating the requirement to store any historical data nobody notices whats the law its on the tip of my tongue better money drives worse money into circulation this leads to a sort of osmotic effect where capital moves into the better money hard money drives out bad money the market will decide if bch is truly better than btc it will be used in place of it where btc falls short if that doesnt happen then that means all this hoopla was for naught,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUX3NyZlhGV2hKVlphM1E3OGp6aDZtLTZLWFhvNzZvbHR0ZEczeVlWclpqbTAxTTM1WFM5YzJjWkRYLUxTTUxMZFlSNXM4QW1rS0gxSFJ3WlFLZXNWS2JGMk43T0IzeXZndWxNUC1iakUxQVk9

thanks for the reply >but all of this is assuming satoshi was using cash in the same way roger is i think that what satoshi meant by calling bitcoin digital cash was that it could be used as a final settlement without any third parties similar to cash i dont think his use of the word cash has anything to do with payment size i think satoshi was actually very clear on why he chose the word cash to describe his invention reread literally the first paragraph of the whitepapers introduction reproduced below >commerce on the internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments while the system works well enough for most transactions it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model completely nonreversible transactions are not really possible since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes the cost of mediation increases transaction costs limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make nonreversible payments for nonreversible services with the possibility of reversal the need for trust spreads merchants must be wary of their customers hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need a certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable these costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party so satoshi was pretty explicitly seeking to create an electronic equivalent to cash in the physical currency sense of that word that would like physical cash <number> enable peertopeer payments that dont require a trusted intermediary <number> enable trulyirreversible payments and <number> have very low transactions costs thereby enabling small casual transactions but regardless of what satoshi meant by cash he unambiguously intended for bitcoin to have extremely low transaction costs eg once it gets bootstrapped there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical i think in <number> or <number> years the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial we should always allow at least some free transactions theres also the design choice of making bitcoin divisible to <number> decimal places<url> >he then goes on to cite the many times satoshi used the term cash and the fact that he never once used the term store of value for the record i think satoshi obviously understood that bitcoin would be both a lowfriction payments network medium of exchange electronic cash system and a store of value although in one sense i dont think store of value is truly a separate function of money expanded thoughts on this point here<url> i suspect satoshi may have deliberately downplayed the finite supply store of value aspects of his invention to make it seem less threatening to tptb >i know this one will not br taken well here in this sub but ill say it anyways hes dead wrong about full nodes i disagree some of my thoughts on the full nodes argument are outlined here<url> heres a bigpicture summary of my argument for why smallblockism is so dangerously wrong <number> it directly undermines bitcoins money property by increasing transactional friction when literally the entire purpose of money is to reduce transactional friction <number> it is unambiguously a radical departure from the clearlyexpressed intent of bitcoins inventor <number> it prevailed via a campaign of extreme and outrageous censorship a campaign that my recent nowarning noexplanation permaban from rbitcoin suggests continues to this day <number> it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of bitcoins security model ie the idea that having lots of nonmining socalled full nodes is necessary to keep bitcoin decentralized <number> moreover even if that view of bitcoins security model were correct it would at best only justify being careful not to scale too quickly not a complete abandonment of additional onchain scaling and given the massively deflationary nature of computer technology the safe rate of onchain scaling would still follow some underlying exponential trend <number> it forces scaling to occur on socalled second layers that are necessarilyimperfect money substitutes that become progressively more imperfect as onchain fees rise and the amount of leverage in the system increases ie as the second layers grow in size relative to the tiny artificiallyconstrained base blockchain atop which they operate re the last point

bch bull is a permissionless decentralised app it utilises anyhedge which is written in cashscript the smart contracts are done noncustodially onchain and fully funded the whole time and as such the risks are largely minimalised but not completely eliminated there are two sides to a contract hedge and long and depending on which side you take market movements as well as supply and demand there are different fees or premiums which you either pay or get paid and you can accomplish a different result hedging is preserving your value no matter what longing is high risk high reward gambling the smart contracts rely on price oracles to determine payouts ideally there should be many oracle providers currently there is only general protocols so this is theoretically a risk practically perhaps not you are also trusting the service itself to function the way it should and be free of bugs malicious code etc you could do a hedge contract with bch to the price of btc relative to eachother if btc rises and bch doesnt you will receive bch to make up for your loss of value in btc terms the inverse is also true if btc lowers and bch doesnt you will end up with less bch than you put in but equal value in terms of btc to what you put in when you did it if btc and bch rise or lower exactly together in terms of usd and maintain their price ratio youll get out more or less exactly the bch you put in and either gain or lose value based on the cryptocurrency market itself moving you could do this with bchusd instead and gain bch as the bch price lowers if the premiums are good at the time you can get paid to do so to do this you just go to the site check the premiums pick what you want to do click stabilise and follow the prompts i made a post a while back asking about the risks some good responses there,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWNHR3WlJfOGNIVXF4VHRjVjhvVTNZLXdCMjVPNFNLaVY5Q1YxTzJWV3NIUUE3amNxaDlnSnpoNUJOOU0wdE9pdGFWTUIxeVJWRUlZMHNWZ250Xy1hSXc9PQ==

do what you are saying is when i cash out large sums of money eg during cycle peaks i should put that cashed out amount into a hedge contract so if im wrong and the market continues appriciating i lose the opertunity cost but keep my initial investment and if i am right i got a risk free short of the market and it settles in bitcoin ready for the next cycle,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWVTBYM2hqOTQtQUVsZl9DUmdTU2xoX3hwNjJZMzhwVVhvdmg0bzNpZUlxbUtFQlZaa0EwUUkwVkdrakpMNlNrM0R3dTJ1YmlkQUJ5SHMxMkJTZWozZ1lnc1Y1NHhhV0Z2MGQzM2ZTclpETTg9

in pure mw as specified in the original paper the only history is the set of unspent transaction outputs utxo set in case youre unfamiliar with that term so it isnt history it is the current state of the system the transaction contains a range proof demonstrating that the new utxo that will exist in the next block belonging to l was owned by k and is less than or equal to a utxo or a few in the current set owned by k the miner cannot see amounts either and he doesnt need to the range proof proves to the miner that k has the money hes spending so in your example the miner sees <number> grins he wouldnt he would just see a schnorr signature with a range proof in it that demonstrates that no minting occurred,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbDZiU2JmQ2hzR3JLeHZGLVNWTS1zVDNTNl9DQTJLek5pSDlzbjc1T2FoMjhMZThlNFRDZlVvWjZWdVlyU0F0LXVKVFNObExpbnpWVzdWekE5OXdqTExwcDBxMDg3djlIQUEwdXdjOVZLS3M9

omg dude the chains split if you owned bitcoin prior to the split then you have both bitcoin and bitcoin cash from there the miners have to choose which chain to mine both chains have different transactions different difficulties if what you said is true bitcoin could never work because forks do occur time to time and miners need to pick one chain because the other chain requires different equations to be solved if they could mine multiple chains at no additional cost then there would be no financial incentive to focus on the longest chain a blockchain each block is dependent upon the block before it if what you said is true then bitcoin cashs hash rate wouldnt be <number> of bitcoins this is why when bitcoin cash split it took them forever to mine the next block then they changed the difficulty adjustment so when they finally hit that they mined faster and got the longest chain thats when people with two braincells to rub together clarified that the chain with the most proof of work is the real chain all it would take is for a miner to stealth mine bitcoin cash for a few weeks then completely overtake the chain its <number> of the bitcoin network,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZExLbUNtNUxRbHByZy1mSG1rSGlrdmdYNUFCVHZVdlRJUmFHWkM1UEUxa0NvUkptX1FNVTRET2RiQWQzMjFaU3hRaklFT0R6bV9nbW9RaldhbUZSaUE9PQ==

if he really made a lot of transactions the proof is on the blockchain so he could show them all think he got greedy <number> btc is a lot now dont know if she has any legal options but would be good to find out how much btc she really bought her investment in dollars at the price <number> years ago and threaten to take action for the whole amount or settle at the proposed <number> btc,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYmsyQjFnZkE0T2h3TVU0b1BKUG9Bd2ItQWdRQU9QU0NHQUxhQ1o2NWN0WFFVOTZHZE5VUFBPcWtMZFNJYjAzQmo0djNmMnJlS00ySHFxQ2pDNFpmZWc9PQ==

i can imagine some ways he might be telling the truth lets break it down an expensive hardware wallet would typically be <cur><number> or so if he bought it off the shelf like a ledger or trezor but maybe he built his own you can turn any computer into a hardware wallet and there are some paranoid people who say thats the only way to be sure you can trust the hardware buy a brand new computer remove the wifi fill the ethernet and other ports with glue and use dvds for a fresh linux install wallet install and blockchain download he might account <cur><number> for that new computer or even more if he got somebody else to do it or got a good computer because he wants to use it for other things those last two options defeat the high security benefits but maybe hes new to computer security it gives you questions to ask like what brand of hardware wallet costs so much then theres the numerous transaction and exchange fees bitcoin transactions can easily cost <cur><number> to send your coins to an exchange <number> in exchange trading fees <number> on the spread and another <cur><number> for withdrawal do that a hundred times and it adds up then it could be much worse if he was trying to buy low and sell high and got it backwards its an easy mistake to make if your partner had agreed to let him trade with the crypto in the hopes of profit then she may have accepted the risk of loss too or maybe he moved some of it to bad technology like lightning where its easy for your entire transaction to go missing or maybe one or more exchanges refused to let him withdraw his money because he couldnt pass their kyc rules and he wrote off those losses it happens sure these costs are very high compare to an index fund or actively managed fund but it sounds liike her ex was not a professional if you let an amateur manage your money for you and accept the high volatility and risks of an unbacked virtual asset class like crypto you may experience extraordinary losses to my mind it depends on what the agreement was between them was she expecting him to just buy and hold some crypto for her then yeah hes stealing to cover his losses or did she agree to help fund this complex venture of his with the understanding that there would be a steep learning curve then shes lucky to get anything back,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkaTNuaVdKUllpWGZHYVNLLU55bkZaLWtsYnY0X01GbnNld3lrdTRkME0zTTNtXzhxdFJGQmdqaldBWGZ4ZnJMeU81Rms3ZUU0ekZ4MDk3X3M3a0swOVE9PQ==

im clearly not praising bsv im saying that i dont trust the results of bsv as they are effectively solomined by the people behind it the reason i bring up bsv is because its despite me not trusting it and me not thinking it is valid is the only known example of a comparable blockchain processing ~<number> million per day im also not saying that the block size is the bottleneck it has arguably never been the bottleneck on bch even back when it was mb someone filled the mempool in january <number> with particularly large convoluted transactions with embedded anti bch messages over days presumably someone throwing away the bch side of their forked btc it was cleared out mb per block no problem transactions with <number> or <number> satbyte was mined straight away blocksize has especially not been a issue after mb blocks became a thing in <number> bch has never gotten close to having a sizable mempool or fee market correct me if i am wrong but abla is designed to prevent any future internal disputes in bch about block size changes block size changes were part of the pretext for the bsv split along with transactionreordering but i think that was just the story told at the time because it was clear the people behind bsv wanted to control bch through asic miners abla itself would not actually increase the transaction capacity of bch currently unless it was constrained by block size which it is not i made a purchase yesterday with bch to my surprised it took <number><number> mined blocks to go through the mempool coincidentally had ~mb of transactions and they were being mined mb at a time until the last block cleared out the remaining <number>mb <url><url> abla is a antidote to potential social consensus splits about bch block size while also being predictable and stable but it itself does not increase the current practical upper limit on transactions the network can handle without issues it will however prevent block size from being a issue in the future if and when mb becomes a bottleneck,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYzUzY01tTzBEZVJYSTNucE12U2t5SVFnY1FuYVBSSXBkMF90QWdTWTVEQkFIcFh2ZkdGLWVtdXZXaFVvUXFnMzI5WTMxWFpwcUM0dENKTnFJMURvOVE9PQ==

it seems vitalik was also browsing rbtc to research this post so maybe he sees this thread to catch up with what the community is thinking if so vitalik you should know that most of the community discussion no longer really happens on rbtc for a variety of reasons things have moved on to lots of telegram subgroups twitter places like bitcoincashresearch separately to that here was my response that i posted on twitter mid<number> vitalik is thinking about the blocksize war seems prompted by hijacking bitcoin release but rising bch momentum organisation is possibly also a minor factor hes clearly done some digging links to abla work by bitcoincashautist but seemingly misattributes it to bitcoin unlimited and criticises it on the basis it isnt clean simple which is a little rich as the driving force behind eths complexity explosion it seems he may have mistaken abla for the earlier proposal emergent consensus as theres nothing about abla in the blocksize war i believe it wasnt even proposed until post book release abla isnt that technically complicated but more importantly its designed to be simple from a governance perspective not a technical one ironically this is also part of vitaliks case against bch that it struggled as a rebellious fork to gain credibility competence through experience stable governance bch actually does have that now with major network upgrades shipped without contentionsplit in <number> <number> <number> <number> the research he did on the latest in bch seems to be surface level enough that it didnt get abla right let alone to the meat of chips let alone cashtokens or upcoming upgrades of bch bliss were seeing the same delayed reasoning about bch that eric wall among others was hampered by despite being <number> years clear of bsv <number> years clear of splits at all with a metric ton of progress quietly completed to boot mostly the crypto industry still sees bch as the adjust one parameter infighting simpletons more concerned with principles than results ironically this is despite the work i others have done to make it easier than ever to catch up to bchs current status but theres not enough general buzz to justify that investigation yet with great effort it was possible to prompt eric to take a fresh detailed look which significantly overhauled his perspective and it seems vitalik needs the same to catch on i dont know what will trigger that but its likely by <number> or <number> upgrade time the whispers of bch trailblazing will have become the topic du jour regardless having a prominent voice explaining how the allin bet on ln has failed although supposedly big blockers arewere the incompetent ones is great for industry narrative progress i would finally note that vitalik cites adam backs turn from <number><number><number> mb as a case of big blockers being unwilling to compromise when its rather a clear case of adams gaslighting rugpull that proves the opposite like vitalik says the right sees the left as naive just as the big to small blockers its great to see encouragement of everyone to read up on bch blocksize war important lessons from the past will become more common knowledge it will trickle into curiosity of where things are at on the lessknown bch side today truth doesnt rust and as time goes on the world is slowly getting the message with many delays misconceptions false narratives along the way but we are knocking those down <number> by <number> this is a positive step forward for sure just wait until vitalik has reason to catch up to bch in <number> or <number><number> as the case may be,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsbEtVSHh3WnN1TlhkTFVQbUVBT1dLU2hLZ3hsaHhENmNmeTJDa3JSTlJ6R0JPekk0aFl5MlNPRTVqblR1cTQxQl9iS05lWWs5M3NqRV9VNzNTYmJtbnc9PQ==

he presents a really thoughtful overview i think that there are two quotes that best sum up the situation from a macro and pragmatic perspective bitcoin favors maximum predictability of the cost of reading the blockchain at the expense of the minimum possible amount of predictability of the cost of writing to the blockchain with predictably very healthy results in the former metric and disastrous results in the latter metric ethereum with its current governance model favors medium predictability of both a quote from <number> but essentially what we ended up with although in pragmatic terms i believe that the predictability of reading was the right path to go down as the ecash idea became increasingly redundant and yes tons of people here will disagree but imo bitcoins best use case in the present day and age is as an sov and this is the broader consensus from an uptake perspective one side monopolizes all the competent people but uses its power to push a narrow and biased perspective the other side correctly recognizes that something is wrong but engulfs itself in a focus on opposition failing to develop the technical ability to execute on its own i wont say too much on this other than many on this sub and people like roger are often too focused on what they presume to be wrong with btc rather than having a more singular and positive focus on alternative protocol development ie protocols like bch whataboutisms are always the weakest form of debate,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsNGxJYURKeU0ydC1hVGR1U2x2azhRenpWSkt6bGtBSFBJNFJ0eUFsRm83T2l4Z2FvbHN0SjBfQWg1LTNjc2FRYUJCNmNMQ3k3SXFLcjV4UlpiX1hoQkE9PQ==

i dont think that vitalik is ignorant if anything he is one of the few people in crypto to pay close attention to a wide range of industry development so id say hes very well aware of where developers are the most active and where investment is focused but regardless i think his point is much more about the idea of negative campaigning taking precedent over future action and i think the jury is very much out with bch it sits somewhat awkwardly in the payments landscape without enough of a critical mass of users to become an industry leader and very much on an island in terms of chain interoperability and it ties into the other quote about readabilitywriteability there are chains with more writeability potential in terms of tps and overall volumetvl i hope it succeeds i still hold some after all but i think that those two quotes highlight important areas of insight as to why thats not assured,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsUU10R3lqTGdQVS1FWFZ2c282NzB1aURPa2tDZC0xT3N2TlQ1S2duU0pQUEZ5X3M0bWdmSmlNVmZWUktvWEJEclV0TmRGOVdrNTktQ0pnYkZQZzNERGc9PQ==

the actual fees are the fees you pay when you make a transaction while it is sometimes possible to time your transactions so the fees will be lower this is not always the case with btc indeed if your needs are correlated with market events there is a good chance that the fees will be highest at the times when you need to make a transaction a good example was found in december <number> people wishing to sell funds held in self custody had to send them to an exchange at the worst possible time however it was worse than this and still is the fees are unpredictable there is no predictability of what fees are required to achieve timely arrival of funds thus people in december <number> suffered more than just high fees they suffered market slippage in price when delays in sending funds upset their market timing after such an experience many people rightly concluded that btc was completely broken,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsZEVFTDhmbWdEVU1yQ0h0RnNvX1VqaHJHa3VMbEQxUXZVQU84cUdSZ0I3YV9aNmFJdkNHb2duN3FGSXd3QUNUa3lqTzIzeE1ZUk1obHBVLUh0LWY5VUE9PQ==

you do realise that im quoting vitalik its as though most of the people commenting on this thread didnt bother to read his article and in the context of what he wrote in that section it really has nothing at all to do with lightning network the main debate was about readability vs writeablely which i also quoted so his position is related to core development which i would largely agree with and thats not to say there arent good devs in bch its just that the majority of development sided with bitcoin bchs future is really about finding a dominate pathway vs a handful of other protocols in the payments space i hope it happens but the fight if there is one really isnt against bitcoin or lighting there are a bunch of protocols with far more volume and tps than either,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtS0k4clQ5SE1lNE8yaTFqSEpJN2IycXlkajlZdmNROGlGNnVHRWVnaEdzU290ZDYtSFFzR0NmaXhDWENzcEFNdG05VmwyZ1NrR3RHS0lfUXVoSWNMSHc9PQ==

this sub is effectively unmoderated at this time and is cruising steadily towards a date with destiny when reddit decides the sub is unmoderated and allows someone else to take it over myself and the rest of the former mod team have stepped down following the unacceptable situation in which the owner of the sub umemorydealers allowed himself to be gamed by a scammer into firing the entire mod team and replacing it with people completely unknown to the members of this sub these new mods did invite the old team back but with reduced permissions as moderators and subject to the whims of the new top mods who have superiority in the hierarchy no apology was issued to the old mods who had done nothing wrong and in fact were the best mods this sub has ever had in my biased opinion the new mods are not performing their duties in my opinion as of last week there were no mod discussions and as far as i can tell theres no moderation of spam or abuse as i understand it reddit has new rules if a moderator is inactive does not perform any moderator duties for over a certain time period <number> month then through some process they can be removed it is my deep concern that since the new mod team is mostly derelict there exists a very real risk that the entire team from the sub owner on down can be removed and replaced by whoever complains the most this will likely be the end of this sub as we know it as a matter of principle i have appreciated having roger as the top mod owner of the sub roger is wealthy and is unlikely to sell his position for a bribe and since he holds strong ideas about free speech roger does not abuse his power to control the discussion here those two things make him a very good candidate to own this sub the same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of us who are not as wealthy as roger i dont speak for the former mod team but only for myself however i suspect the others feel the same as i do im very disappointed that roger instead of admitting his mistake and putting the old team back the way it was since there were no actual problems inserted a layer of management of unknown people above the former mod team effectively demoting all the old mods to housekeepers and giving management to the new unknowns an actual apology would have been nice too i dont know who these new mods are i dont want to be subject to their whims the old mod team was made up of og rbtcers that everyone knew trust was established and maintained the new mods are still basically mystery people no bueno so the sub is drifting in space effectively unmoderated and is approaching a date with destiny when an attacker decides to formally report the sub as unmoderated and requests control over it at that point everything we have done here and the entire history of the sub which is still searchable on reddit will probably be deleted for good and thus the best archive of the actual history of the blocksize war will finally be erased and replaced with a constructed narrative and that will be the end of our history upyalot umobtwo ulovelydayhere ushadowofharbringer uthomaszander,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM2MteklCS1pGNDVCZEdvdUc4QldtaERxaDh6eThHU253YTdUd3NUYnJ3TXl3Tm8wMjIyc2phV1Z5TzdLOTlWUnRkUjhWVkt2R1hvQ1VYQlY3ejhIOVE9PQ==
a substantial portion of tao tokens reserved in the treasury managed by the core team this control potentially undermines the projects decentralization claims additionally bittensors funding through private sales to venture capital firms introduces centralized interests which may prioritize profit over the networks decentralized goals the initial token allocation including the treasury used for investor sales raises concerns about equitable distribution and insider influence challenging its commitment to true decentralization there are also unresolved challenges including scaling the network effectively and ensuring true decentralization through its sudogovernance model transitioning from proof of work to proof of stake presents security risks and integrating diverse subnets remains complex potentially leading to performance inconsistencies and fragmentation it would also appear that paid npcs are sent roaming crypto subs to promote it such as parent poster,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTnQyQ252OE5Xcm1iWWx6Q3FHRjRhTG9VYkt4T3VkUWdhMXdTaXE4ZXNsS2NIZnp6S09ralJoR3BDNE9qS2J0RWZZYmhmX1pmZVo1a2xMVDYwdkgwVEE9PQ==

yes and it can be abused read your own comment then use your original logic instead of changing from sec doing congresses bidding to now the president can abuse vetos to game the system theres a correct way to veto and an incorrect way the issue is that even if a president incorrectly vetoes something their party wont vote to impeach them so they can really corrupt the system of law without ever being accountable for their incorrect actions so if someone commits a crime but doesnt get prosecuted does that make the crime ok or just they are getting away with doing a bad thing,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuMUFXNEpPT2dDVjhxOWhXNzY3RW92ZFZIWnBJZDB3dXU3Z1BzeWE0blNSWFNEbThhYkttR0c5RzNGNlR0VTlXUDhWYVNnSnl5alRieTVzbDNUanhNRmc9PQ==

from my understanding its what you see with low fees crypto users are spamming the network because its essentially free to make transactions so with bitcoins price being so low back then it was to prevent users from flooding for no other reason than being cheap to do so,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvMkpkWDROTzk5UVBOUnBuXzZqZ01PZFZZN0RYcWVaNVZ0R21BTGNoa0QxbU03Ry1leWhzb1I1RjMyLWIyTzJoazlQZUVIbVR0azJ1dUN4ekFvUnhWZXc9PQ==
you didnt answer the question at all btc has experienced more spam attacks in the past <number> years than ever before and thats after its become a <cur><number>trillion asset and has been around almost <number> decades ops question is a good one imagine if btc had mb block sizes just more room for spam to go especially sense that spam would be cheaper and faster to produce increasing the block size creates more problems than it solves,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZHdfMlVHdW1LOUlSaWNrWXl3QjZDLVFyZmlGTFlrdzNnMkJHejA5RkdDR1ZOWmcwMHc1Vm5ubHF0X2M5Wlo2aDVheGFObVdZWWlWUGJIM25TSlNLWmc9PQ==
agreed but why wouldnt this same reason apply to today why does the price of bitcoin change anything the price of transactions is what prevents users from flooding the chain and even with btcs small block size and higher txn fees it has been spammed more recently than ever before with ordinals and such it really does seem to be the goldilocks spot in my opinion the perfect blocksize for what it is intended to be and its likely satoshi realized this a little bit later a while after the whitepapers release,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvbkltVU51R1V3bHAyNEstbmlrdEVhVUpzSjh1c3JYQ0NDcHVZSDFOWHM4SnJpMjItVkRaTGkwWmlwSG8yYTFCOGxqWi1jaFdlcXRZY015VTdySnZkVFE9PQ==

and degrade performance the economic feasibility of sending numerous transactions at little to no cost makes these networks attractive targets for such attacks verge xvg mining exploits and spam attacks in <number> in april and may <number> verge xvg faced significant issues due to malicious attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in its mining algorithm attackers were able to manipulate the networks difficulty adjustment mechanism allowing them to mine blocks with minimal effort and flood the network with a large number of small transactions this resulted in severe delays and bloated the blockchain with unnecessary data making it difficult for legitimate transactions to be processed efficiently the spam attacks highlighted the vulnerability of the network to exploitative behavior particularly due to its low transaction fees which made it economically feasible for attackers to execute such strategies iota network congestion issues in <number> in early <number> the iota network known for its feeless transaction structure experienced significant congestion due to spam transactions the iota network uses a unique architecture called the tangle where each transaction confirms two previous transactions this feeless nature while innovative made it susceptible to abuse malicious actors took advantage of this by generating a high volume of spam transactions overwhelming the network and causing delays in transaction confirmation times the congestion underscored the challenges of maintaining network integrity and performance in a feeless transaction environment when faced with deliberate attempts to clog the system eos network congestion in <number> in november <number> the eos network which aims to offer high scalability and low transaction fees encountered congestion issues due to spam attacks a gambling decentralized application dapp on the eos network was targeted by an attacker who spammed it with a large number of transactions the low fees on eos made it costeffective for the attacker to execute this spam attack which led to significant network congestion the influx of transactions caused performance degradation affecting the user experience and transaction processing times across the network this incident illustrated the vulnerability of lowfee networks to spam and highlighted the need for mechanisms to prevent such abuses bitcoin btc dust spam attack in <number> in july <number> the bitcoin network experienced a dust spam attack attackers sent numerous tiny transactions dust across the network creating a significant backlog of unconfirmed transactions the primary goal was to bloat the blockchain and disrupt normal transaction processing although bitcoin has relatively higher transaction fees compared to some other cryptocurrencies the attackers used these small transactions to clog the network highlighting potential vulnerabilities in handling lowvalue spam bitcoin cash bch stress test by bad actors in <number> in august <number> bitcoin cash was subjected to a stress test orchestrated by bad actors who flooded the network with millions of transactions unlike the communitydriven stress test in september this earlier event was not consensual and aimed to disrupt the network by exploiting its low transaction fees the attack caused significant delays and showcased how easily lowfee networks could be overwhelmed by malicious spam nano network spam attack in <number> nano a cryptocurrency known for its feeless transactions and fast confirmation times faced a spam attack in march <number> an attacker flooded the network with transactions exploiting its feeless nature to create congestion this led to delays and performance issues challenging the networks capacity to handle high transaction volumes efficiently stellar xlm network spam attack in <number> in april <number> the stellar network which offers very low transaction fees experienced a spam attack the attacker generated numerous transactions to fill the networks capacity causing slowdowns and increased processing times the low fees on the stellar network made it inexpensive for the attacker to execute this spam campaign affecting overall network performance tron trx network spam attack in <number> in late <number> the tron network was targeted by a spam attack where the attacker generated a large number of small transactions to flood the network tron known for its low transaction fees became congested due to this influx of spam transactions leading to delays and increased transaction times this incident

> why cant spammers spam the blockchain once again in this thread you have ulordsamadhi claiming btc has been spammed more in the last <number> years than ever before now only one of the two can be true either its being spammed or it isnt ill put forward that if the maximum block size is bigger and the underlying infrastructure technology can handle those bigger blocks it becomes harder to execute a spam attack because transactions are not free and miners can raise the minimum fee floor if they feel the network is under attack so spamming a big block network isnt as cheap as many people think the more your network can handle the costlier it becomes some ex billionaire tried it though,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvcl9FU1RYb0k3alZnVHJIOU9hNE5lY253MEQtczhoSTgzWUc2aWg2alRsVnNjYXVpUVpONU9jS3lqdXZSMWNhOTJ0Nm55a0UxVHh5VXRzcmRGUmVDUFE9PQ==

the trick is to not spam the network yourself but to create incentives for others to spam the network one example was proofofproof mining veriblock paid popminers who created bitcoin transactions attesting to their blockchain with freshly minted veriblock coins vbk which costs them nothing but traders were willing to pay money for them they were at some time responsible for <number><number> of the transactions now the coin is basically worthless and i couldnt find any recent bitcoin transaction used for veriblock attestation another example are the brc<number> coins and runes there you can just create a token and everyone can mint it by sending transactions this was also quite effective in creating lots of transactions as the tokens usually traded even higher than it cost to mint them whether people doing this managed to sell their minted coins for profit is a question i could never answer but even a perceived profit that cannot be sustained longterm can incentivize a lot of transactions since people just hype into the free money train without caring if they can eventually cash out,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZDZVNlQ0cWN1VkVMSzlsOWFELU9OMkZiU3dBNEdqZHZYVVE3TENmaDNxM3VDaW5lQ01TVUFEbmVkVi02ZEIyQldXdFhyUnFXa2E3UlJGVzlwcHBaclE9PQ==

there are multiple node implementations however they are invalid if they differ materially in their rule handling so effectively control over the protocol rests with whatever decisions the bitcoin core team makes edit user nullc is using this discussion to whitewash the discussion and is using the reddit trick of banning people so that others cant see that hes being called out no doubt hes blocking everyone who disagrees with him over time the people who know the truth wont ever see his comments in this sub and he will be allowed to propagandize at will maybe after hes gained control over the sub for good the sub owner will finally learn that his dumb ideas on radical free speech simply do not apply on discussion boards where tolerance can be gamed to distort the conversation,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSldiUlc0SzVEZHBROVF6cDhVb0d0dlRtOWVlc2piZ2tRem1fWFM3LVdqQXJjNmJvNldOelhqR0htckFaeWJ2NkIzSEllaG5nOUozNENBaWxBOThJMmRvUFJtRk1fNE9EeGhSQWlYM2xWQzA9

replying to my own post to highlight the discussion that nullc has hidden this is my reply to his claim that bitcoin is developed consensually and without control anyone whos ever edited a controversial wikipedia page understands that consensual collaboration actually looks like a playground shoving match where the bigger bully controls the narrative thats how development works on controversial open source projects like bitcoin core so what we have here is that the bully has come to our playground to try to gaslight us into believing that his playground isnt run by bullies,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJveVc5cEJydWhnYTVUTVBoWlY1dXBwUzBvNXRjVFktY3dFb25FV01ROVhMbERoaDRXZVZTLUM1S3FhVXlVRnNtYW9CZXRNUk5oWVFPUlZBaG1OS1BCcFZIYUZ1M25NWjR3dXlDX0JjRlN5akU9

> why no other implementation of the bitcoin protocol has been created since the bch split you can easily find people arguing that this isnt the case they may cite to you things like bsv xececash or even other lesser known forks of what used to be bitcoin code so you need to define what you mean by the bitcoin protocol you will find one group who likes to maintain a stranglehold on the meaning of that term even as they alter the meaning of it and they like to masquerade their intent by claiming that its the ticker btc which defines bitcoin > why is core the only implementation of bitcoin this isnt technically correct as others have pointed out the question should perhaps be why is bitcoin core such a dominant implementation what is it more than <number> of nodes one answer but incomplete is that it is really difficult for alternative implementations to gain the trust of users since small differences in implementation can lead to big financial loss as a first approximation that risk is lowered if people mostly run the same implementation which isnt to say that bugs in a single implementation cant cause similar financial loss they sure can,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvXzI3ZkdKZ1pwc2xfN09ObGE0N0hJVGtqZEMwY0NNa3VlWFJST1hzaWVyWkVXT2JwUDlYZ1NZRmV6NVh4UWVobVdLa2tmYjNPTk5fT1ZzUFU2OVJvSGc9PQ==

and we can expand on this answer by addressing the money quality of a crypto reliable expectation of functionality correlates not only to the stability of a crypto currency but also to the restraint of its developers because it is the basis upon which people come to rely on the system in order to use it for value exchanges setting aside the blueprint and development path the first order of business in development is removing bugs and enhancing security any changes to the intentional function of the currency must be done with great care much discussion and a patient approach as lovelydayhere points out small differences in implementation can lead to big effects including large financial losses so every new version must be carefully vetted and on top of that you need people who understand the importance of reliability because this is peoples trust and assigned value youre dealing with choices should be made judiciously and with a mind towards the ethical implementation of any proposed changes to intended function without burning the early adopters bitcoin core was coopted they circled the wagons to shut out and silence criticism and then they allowed a crisis to become an opportunity to platform a monopolistic offchain service called lightning because bad actors are out there and they are willing to exploit preexisting value there will always be this need for vigilance against deceptionfraud that would harm those who hold or use a given crypto generally speaking thats why even a lousy crypto like bitcoint core couldnt go full nuclear and scare away all the prospective users the goal was to latch on and paracitize the most prominent example of crypto currency they dont want to kill the golden goose they just want to be well positioned to maximize their takings because bitcoin core now panders to maximalists and speculators with low information they can lock people in with high fees and as a result this degrades the utility which was originally intended for bitcoin bitcoin was meant for the entire planet to use it and be as accessible as possible bitcoin core could have had more adoption by now and replaced banks but you know there was a financial interest in banks preventing that from happening thats where we are at this point,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZVE2ektFYzBGRHpFY090aHI1bG1wNzVHN0Jjd1BjSmFLZTBsX1pFcGhXU1luZnNNa28yVk1SMG5qaXM2VE5DRnJ0QndRbl9FYkY3aS1vR0h1YXhEbkE9PQ==

i did read and reply to what you actually said and i didnt make any strawman argument you said spams primary purpose is consuming space on the blockchain and a regular transactions purpose is exchange of value thats why i asked you the questions i did none of the transactions from the first <number> months of bitcoins existence had value so were not exchanges of value encoding messages into a blockchain via opreturn is not an exchange of value because its mostly a transaction sent from <number> address to another you control in the same wallet the same as consolidations would be but because those transactions pay a fee to miners they become exchanges of value by exchanging their bitcoin fee to the miner that publishes their transaction onto the blockchain my original reply to the main comment was to point out that a paying transaction is a paying transaction and that spam can only hinderharm a blockchain that has a limited block size if blocksize scales dynamically to the amount of transactions coming in it cant prevent another persons transaction from being confirmed and it makes the blockchain more profitable to securemine,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2aENqaXFIeDduU1F1WklCS25zdnhYM2pOdTBoMXd2V3hSNGo5bzRLSUZBYTdKU2xjczE2VGN4QnlxaDZrNEdXRUE1elZsTV9YcDZ2VEV3MFVFTmxoeVE9PQ==

btc is not meant to be used it is meant as a speculation vehicle with no redeeming utility otherwise kind of like gold if gold could not be used in jewelry and electronics and everytime you want to move your gold it costs you between <cur><number><cur><number> depending on how many other people want to move their gold at the same time the ngu high priests will tell you to use ln to move your gold to do so you need to slide some of your gold coins in a sealed tube from one end of the tube to the other then if multiple people have tubes between themselves you can make a payment network it costs between <cur><number><cur><number> to buy a tube depending on how many people buy tubes at the same time and seal the coins inside to take your coins out of the tube is another <cur><number><cur><number> you need multiple tubes at all times to improve chances for the system to work tubes will randomly break payments will randomly not work because the tube transit fees exceed the value of the payment for most small payments there might not be enough coins in somebody elses tubes that are the only link between the sender and recepient there might not be any link or it isinfeasible to discover the link because routing is unsolved you need to watch the tubes at all times because somebody could use them to cheat you and if that happens you need to get your coins out of the tube faster than they can cheat you this is the path btc has been set on when it forked off bitcoin in <number> and according to ngu loredogma this was more responsiblereasonable than raising the blocksize limit,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2ZlZjclhZMFJBNkVpN0ZGa3FKSGd6WndTT0huX015YngwYlMzTV92TDVNbExoNjRGQjh4NWxhU2twNVlSWnJESXlIZUl5b1RjTC1pNFJrQTBLTmh5M2c9PQ==

i think binance is not the only exchange doing this i think this is done all over the trading spectrum they have market maker bots that liquidate overleveraged small retail traders who have not sufficient margin funds to hold on to a position and then they make them hit their stop losses they can do this because they can see on real time all of the leveraged positions on every market and act accordingly using an algorithm that allows to make look as if it was a natural market move,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2NVg2aEVvcWdEX3VhbU14RXlzN2NJOFBEZkRaVDkyRGVRcUdSTDBwMEZrTUFnaEVhLUhibjJ6VGpyamZFWjRpdkE0QkdaRkdUcmE3VGJzendfaWtpbGc9PQ==

i believe this is more of an issue with english than with the bitcoin community in particular > the bitcoin community hates when we talk about bitcoins > its called bitcoin without adding the s properly speaking its bitcoin capitalized for the system but bitcoin uncapitalized for the currency unit the latter can be singular or plural just as with any other countable noun eg i have <number> bitcoins or bitcoin both forms are acceptable plurals as far as im aware probably due to it commonly having fractional amounts the former is a proper noun which is uncountable so its not normally used in plural > so what about satoshisat plural form is sats if so why the same rule applies satoshi or sat is a unit not a name so it should not be capitalized and it can be used in plural in this case the plural normally does have an s since it is usually in integer amounts there is no equivalent of bitcoin for it we use the bitcoin system not the satoshi system,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2NTZkMmlJdlNnbkNqbGR1N3Jub2J6REUwTXRBQ09zcHY3YTBqVUxDYXNCUU4zVjlLdjE5YkMxMDV4T1hyVnNWTDNpblBMbXNUSG43S0psa2lLM3JiaUE9PQ==

none of the things youre talking about involve transactions made with the intent of consuming block space so clearly they are not spam all of the other transactions you listed with the exception of posting messages are exchanges of value even if the value was as yet indeterminable posting messages is not an exchange of value and the fact that someone paid a miner to do it doesnt magically convert content to value however if the intent isnt too be disruptive then its not spam but just a likelyunsupported use case that ought to be discouragedan example of this is memocash which isnt spam but just an example of someone misusing a pp cash system as a data store this idea that all transactions are perforce valid as long as they pay a miner fee needs to die in a fire and fast that is toxic messaging that we managed to be free of when bsv split away but seems to be coming back now that bsv is officially a failure and some of that community is returning to bch information systems must be purpose built if they are to succeed anyone who ever was on a project that died from scope creep understands this intuitively but nonspecialists may not understand satoshi was right when he said that app data belongs on a different blockchain in satoshis time the app in question became namecoin but the principle is the same one blockchain for all potential use cases of blockchains is rather literally like having one single database for all potential use cases for databases its wrongheaded on its face and has no place in bch,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bGN3NVNabXF4U2JmanpyN09rUDZXeEVHbUZOa0JxV3M1UkJXRjRrc0d2V2I4YXJjQTB1bk1KRWs4bk9xRDFDbXVwdmVEUDNtQUt2VldtTjIyT3JxZ3FCd2hWOVpaZ0pTYU5EeWowbjJQT289

buying bitcoin is similar to buying a foreign currency theres overheads involved which in the case of btc are quite big sending bitcoin means transferring them to someone else ie paying someone in bitcoin over the internet usually it sounds like the guy wants to either scam you or get paid in btc but not incur the overheads of converting from usd to btc himself these overheads are significant esp if youre new to this you may easily lose more money not to mention time than your btc purchase amount you can lose significant money spending btc because of its high transaction fees this means youd need to budget for a higher amount than <cur><number> but unfortunately since btc is pretty broken and youd normally need to use middlemen like centralized exchanges to buy some its too hard to predict how much youll end up spending another thing bitcoin transactions are irreversible scammers love to get people to send them btc and then they do not send the product leaving you out of money,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MGJpa3lRS0xrXzZrZnU0VnNkaVhGbkhRSU1ES29wQzNCNXA0cmxfdjdkOV80SXhuQzczX3lSMloxbVFJQWxQenRidEdpRXNQYmFSTjVfUGoxeDJyVGc9PQ==

yeah part of the bitcoin wins argument is that anything a competitor does bitcoin can just take that tech and use it but bch can do the same and have bigger blocks i guess some could argue bitcoin could go big block in the future but that seems unlikely i heard a solana dev say basically it doesnt matter if they have problems once in a while because its still way better than the traditional system which has outages and censorship and business hours etc i think a lot of people are compelled by thatthey would rather have throughput with some downtime im not sure why you think lightning doesnt scale its riddled with problems and is generally a pain to use especially manually setting up your own node it is currently pretty centralized but you can always run your own node so censorship can be evaded the throughput is theoretically higher than any l like at least millions of tps,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Wi1JUmEtN0Q0OXFJLW5CeGFvc3FHQk9GYlMtNFh5UG1KVWlab24wc2cwZlNXcFFYN3ZsVVd0ejVSb2NzaUUyRGlNUGNPeXBkUnJDUTV2OEV3NUVBVWQyYlpGOE85VVFER0ZTWjJYNE50eGM9

the thing that you have to remember about the lightening network is that its never likely to work lnw likely never work the best case scenario is that you have many small but indeterminate payments to make so you do it through a channel but opening and closing channels requires an onchain btc transaction so that its no good unless you will make <number> or many more payments as btc transactions are expensive and only likely to become more so the second thing to remember is this is not in any sense bitcoin at all bitcoin and many other spinoffs such as bch work because of the inovations and new thinking outlined in the bitcoin white paper its a genuine new invention before bitcoin online payment was only possible by using a trusted rd party such as a bank this invention is possibly as revolutionary as say the invention of television eventually it really will affect the lives of everyone on the planet and i believe in a good way overall the lightning network when it works does not use this technology although bch is bitcoin as it was in <number> fast cheap reliable to be honest there are many coins that exhibit these wonderful original bitcoin characteristics and btc is not one of them take a look at bch dash doge or even etherium,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VFdoT3VWdDU5Z2lGS09fVEg5TlA2UW5YMWtELVRuaVhOa09iQXZPRW9KNDRSOXpiV3N0WlJzVjRMS1ZaMU5qbXlqQVRtSzV3OGlGcHdPdTJmZXJTUEE9PQ==

yes the ratio is always onetoone for buyers and sellers but that misses a salient point the market can be in either contango or backwardation if there is large oi in contango someone is shelling out premia in order to be long which would indicate a degree of bullishness if the futures settle in a month or two but some btc futures are settling daily which as i said in the other comment likely reflects activity by the aps,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UjdWQzRDNnhQWjhnV3F6MWVPWENXOXB4SklzeVVRU21tM0kxNlpLcHFFZVRURGh5SjkxQW85Z1U2ZnpjOTBFUk1iSTBfdUlWR0JaWXZSYzNzZ3Q3YlE9PQ==

and everyone that continues to buy fractions of a coin which at some point turn to dust when balance < trx fees eventually creates a positive feedback loop so although the coins still exist not lost or burned they cant be moved this effectively shrinks the pool of liquidity a form of induced artificial scarcity the shrinking supply of coins induces greater demand driving up prices in terms of usd these events will create price spikes stimulating trade action making it further impossible to move minor wallet balances the system will correct itself for example wallets will be sold by exchanging private keys for usd rather than onchain trxs the problem is larger balances get to exit the system first and the smallest hands last effectively small balances can never time the top of the market due to ~~lack~~ cost of liquidity further the block size limit creates a feastorfamine fee rate for miners rather than a steady diet of fees from transactions miners must speculate running in the red while fee revenues are low anticipating the next rushin or rushout market event for example the btc daily fees jumped from ~<cur>mday to <cur>m in the last <number> hours the total number of trxs didnt change and the value of each trx is irrelevant only the needdemand to transact increased this fucks with the game theory where security is now directly proportional to trade demand and not actual use trade volume,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UXIycXF6cFdEbVlJY3MxeWpGb1NpZjNGTGY4SXpkakNpdnVKeHFuUHhlWFlGcnFQVHBnUEQ2RFh5OWx0YTFMaGtBb0hwYXdVVE5RMk9jR1BhdC1PT2c9PQ==

thats exactly how shorting works now for the worst part on an exchange you are never trading custody of any coins youre just making database entries for example if we meet up in a park and i sell you <number> bch for <number> dollars in that transaction actual bch and dollars are exchanged when you put <number> dollars on binance or any exchange your account is credited for the <number> dollars binance is now free to do anything they want with the <number> dollars you gave them lets say they buy btc with it likewise when i put <number> bch on binance or any exchange then my account is credited with <number> bch binance is now free to do anything they want with the <number> bch lets say they buy btc with it now i sell you my <number> bch on binance for <number> dollars all that happens is that my account is debited for the <number> bch and credited with <number> dollars and your account is debited for <number> dollars and credited with <number> bch this happens even though your original dollars and my original bch no longer exist the problem only occurs when you try to withdraw your dollars or bch but binance has turned it into btc at that point binance will have to sell btc for dollars or bch at market price to give to you but if you never withdraw they never have to sell their btc or buy the bch so now lets go back to shorting lets assume that binance wants to crash the price of bch for whatever reason theres nothing in the world that stops them from crediting themselves with k bch that never existed and dumping them at market price its just database entries in their database they can make the database say whatever they want as before the problem only occurs when someone who bought some of that dumped nonesxistent bch wants to withdraw actual bch then binance will have to buy some bch but again if you never withdraw they never have to buy the bch this practice is called naked shorting and is completely illegal in any regulated markets but is legal and i suspect completely widespread on unregulated crypto exchanges,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4QlZLNC1JQVRtaVZHYU4wMlVHNWJWVF9YSXFTSWtOUzY0NDMydWpoQTlEMFB6STM5U2ZFMDJtZVBjMkd6RFZfanZFWm5SWnM4SEM0dTZ6LTN6R1M2U1E9PQ==

its as easy as doing a hardfork to change a variable once or putting it on a schedule or setting up a block size algorithm<url> unless devs have gone in and made hfs impossible and also stipulated a permanent mb base limit in the process bch took the easy way with the way btc was crippled old nodes are expected to operate as if a mb limit exited forever in perpetuity this means that even if btc did attempt to increase the available space later it will involve creating new special classes of block space incompatible with the old and organizing a new complicated tier of consensus rules around that block space that only certain newer upgraded nodes would follow so taproot was once such complicated tiered space block size increase and a year later taproot wizards started exploiting the new space to store jpegs so btc cant just change the block size and the attempts to provision a secondclass extra space have caused huge security usability and optics issues each softfork attempt to solve the problem creates a taller tower of crushing technical debt its why people say premature optimization is the root of all evil because if you let engineers start fixing problems that arent real theyll spiral off into made up problems and never reach the end goal its also why weve seen such extreme market manipulation around hardforks to try to condition the public and blockchain developers away from making simple upgrades at all cost,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5RVcxZ2hsRnpWRHBra3c3bnNMNnNaQjRRSmM1cG81LVQzSXc5QjRFZkU5cnNtaFlOQlYxV2xLQVZpZ25wNVZ5N0l0c0drdlg1QXpORWVkdXU4LWpwZ2c9PQ==

how would you quantify decentralization are you talking about miner decentralization or node decentralization and if so are you talking about nodes that validates the concensus rules or nodes that relay data to other nodes or nodes that archive data for historical purposes are you talking about nodes that comes online once or nodes that come and go over time many of these have very different decentralization impact from bandwidth for example a node that downloads once doesnt relay to others and only wants to validate the consensus rules in order to privately validate the coin emission schedule would need to download data one time and it they had a mbit connection they could support roughly mb blocks and still keep up with the network for a node that relays to other nodes and where the goal is to strengthen the distribution mechanics of the network it might receive data once but send the data to as much as hundreds of other participants multiplying the outgoing bandwidth required significantly such a node also would need to have better bandwidth and network latency than the network average in order to meaningfully provide any benefits if such a node is connected to say <number> other nodes that are slower than it is then on a mbit connection it would only be able to support roughly mb blocks for a node that wants to validate the full network integrity once but otherwise doesnt care it would come online and start downloading all historical blocks with a mbit connection and assuming full mb blocks it can only process gb of data per day which would be roughly <number> days worth of data per day so which user are you asking about and what intent does that user have,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6VHl1NjB3MXl4N1ZTZEZOZVNVeWFpek5VaDBCY180eHZ1Q0t1d1hwdzZSVjYtSnNtS0FDQmF4N3FoQ1dHemtxTlF2aXNCLUdfUk9FVktqQ0hDX0tRNktjYmJnVnRfazQ3M2k5T1JSaVJJeHM9

no no mining is as decentralized as the hardware there are many independent owners of mw mw facilities etc and shad mining is pretty decentralized considering wide spread of the hardware miners need minimal bandwidth to communicate with pool nodes only like few hundreds of bytes every <number> seconds or so pool nodes need to process txs as fast as possible and theres plenty of pools to choose from and all their nodes are well connected so txs and blocks propagate damn fast between them and differences in profitability arent significant so just because there are some popular pools doesnt mean that miners couldnt switch to some other without losing much if any profitability which brings us to the mb tech limitation if blocks would get too big then most popular pool could exploit it to get extra profitavility and ensure permanent dominance,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6OG9KcFFxR1p4ZHhNek1VM2ZnUXJ3Sk5uOC1KaHYxN1M2d1JFUVJ0NXZhYXlxdlM5Yk1kWGhHb1c0U2I4Q3VZN2hMcG5LNnd0M0NkWWZWZ3hQZ1pUeDRqNlNZa3FMX0NMUEdrSVEwakk5SnM9

the math is pretty easy block size time between blocks = required bandwidth so for a gb block and <number> minute block time you need <number> mbs or <number> mbits just over the shittiest dsl that ive seen in a while of course that means the entire ten minutes you are downloading the last block so it would be no good for mining or real time actions but it would be enough to stay synced these days crap cable seems to be around mbits which could easily handle this lets say you are running a miner then you connect to a mining pool the mining pool has nodes on fast internet and keeps up fine lets say you want to run a mining pool then it probably makes sense to get cloud or colo nodes that are on a fast link things that are actually centralizing needing to be in some sort of inset to be a real network participant like anything that uses master node style things needing to have a bunch of funds to run a real node lightning mining only effectively done with dedicated and expensive hardware well we have that mining only done by people who can afford a large stake like eth not trying to shit talk eth i like eth staking i think it is a valuable idea and a good attempt to democratize mining but it isnt perfect,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6YnFCMUxUS3V5QTM5M1JPRnpKSm5oZFRHTFdCOHBPdW5nbnphVWhPUDdDTk1yaFVOdlhWcTNXVWdrX3cxYk9YSGNKa1FWVlVyQkNVYVVRZ1JJSkJkUmc9PQ==

not saying you did any action except disagreeing with their posting style i pinged you on this because seeing a post here removed by reddit admins in this way is extremely rare and i thought maybe admins had given some reason beyond the general pointingattheirpolicies which in this case does nothing to shed light on why they removed the post they should be citing exactly which policy was violated,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SE1QX3NuQlVPakpOVF9JdFFnaW41Mk1HSzVqNzltdU5DdkVKRWZSOFFGTlItVm9ENlpTODVONUtWQXJIYjBPTVB6TzRialFab2RoSGk2a055TnBOb2c9PQ==
i do think there will be another hard fork and the youngnew bitcoiners which is most at this point will have no idea whats going on and the winner in popular opinion will just be whichever one keeps the btcbitcoin name and that will almost certainly be the conservative one so youre probably right i think cbdc is coming sooner or later no matter what anything as an alternative is worth pursuing of course the ideal is an alternative to payments but theres also a place for store of value store of value is also harder to regulate governments can simply ban businesses from accepting any particular payment method bch or btc im undecided about l being a red herring if you include machinetomachine in peertopeer then i dont think any l can scale sufficiently if its just humantohuman then probably wevehadmanyyearsofopportunityforbusinessestocharge usagefeesbuthaveinsteadimplementedasimpler flatsubscriptionmodel it would make sense for netflix for example to charge by the minute but they dont however usetoken is becoming common in ai cant argue with lightnings liquidity issue and all the incoming improvements channel factories still dont adequately address it but i see it as a tradeoff at least lightning is still an actual wallet with bitcoin in it unlike ecash which can be diluted fractioned and the limitation on running your own lightning node isnt so much one of needing fast or expensive hardware its having patience and yes affording an onchain transaction,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6MThNRTc5NTJzSDF5c3lSSnRGdVdwbDlIMjFaeTRUNEpSb2NobldjcnQyYVNHT3JTdkN4ZmVPRVJmNENXVVJVREtOdlJHVGV1SzdNWUtsd3A0c1dSdkFQOUVzZlJOZU9kRVF3UzdjVm43aEk9

its not really compression because you have to download blocks data one way or another it just optimizes the dl by doing it in advance of them getting mined by caching txs as theyre observed you save yourself from having to download the whole block again all at once and instead you can just sync the missing txs so your download is effectively spread across all <number> minutes or so instead of it being <number> until a block is revealed and then having to download it in whole all at once however adversary could intentionally hide txs from public and only reveal them as part of a mined block in an attempt to slow down others and get some mining advantage this is why we need a blocksize limit if it is less than about <number> mb then the adversary couldnt get enough advantage to make a difference >sorry so with gb blocks youre not computationally limited but you are still bandwidthlimited or no yeah still bandwidthlatency maybe disk io utxo db access when validating if it could not fit in ram,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI0OGJBY1VBcmtLNHE1ak5ia0ZHZi1JcjFPejJlNU5lLVBSWXljbThkVHhYZnlTUWIzZVBBbEVZT09wYU93RUR3TTUzRC1Ydmhma1hOQjVzZXpuc1RWeDJEZW5JNGEyU3RIbmlIeXc3SjlqQWc9

utility matters but it seems for now there is too much spare bch supply floating around once some longer term investors take it off the daily trading market the price will stabilize currently margin traders and exchanges who trade against them buy and sell huge amounts daily to control the price in <number> and <number> people will have access to cheap loans again due to rate cuts and we will see more people investing in bch with spare cash so the active supply will take a large hit and much of it will be taken off the market for long periods causing the price to stabilize as less people will be able to margin buy and margin short huge amounts,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1MXA3SzRWdjZCek1CQThQZTRudi1FVWFPOFpmalRLb1c3ejhPUFJzNkh6Vk5sSkdGMy1pa3p1MnlPVnQ5d2RnV1JJUjlId3BYS05HSDVPSkpwWjhHbUE9PQ==

i think the poll questions should be tweaked so they are less leading so the answers they provide result in more specific guidance and poll information are free of typos the questions as written seem to promote an agenda if thats intentional great if its not i think it supports my suggestion of tweaking the questionsi know what bitcoin cash is but not about bitcoin cache was using cache intentional,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R3A0Z0k0bnVlNW9iLW9yRXhFWTM2Q2g2S3kxRzgyZFhGOGlybG1Hc2xxVnpnS0Z6SU9CU2JaelpMcFcxUVVkdWdOdEF0MEtVSFpURXpMTFBXcDFydWc9PQ==
not sure if its lack of moderation or a different moderation approach but rbtc now looks like an ads stream for direct pd ads indirect pd ads and ta price chat none of it is interesting content for me personally on the edge of unsubbing occasional promotion by longstanding contributors to the bch community is definitely a gray area but it doesnt even register on the list of issues the answer to the poll for me is find out what the previous moderators were doing and just keep doing that none of the answers represent my thoughts,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1RnBHOG93LV9HWlZ1QTBlbXEtRHY5NkF6MU1ENjhqazhkdGNrVjZQcm5vN3h4MlhIYjd0WFVBbnNzQ1ZUbWR0WUVoX25MUDh4MlpKSWgwRGdOUUFJakJ6Y0lSOTRlMV9uTnhIVHR4X3pGajg9

avoid censorship and promote bitcoin discussion for sure but also not descend into shitcoin promotion or scams etc the reason i really dont want btc is because i cant use it and its all focused on preserving price now not solving problems actual utility btc has little to do with any of the princples that put it on the map i would like to see content around how to actually get merchants to use this and promote it bitcoin cash + low fees is the only realistic path i see because its btc in every way without the intentional crippling people know bitcoin the rest even if superior in their own ways will have major difficulty displacing due to endless tokencoin flooding anyone promoting btc today had either abandoned that vision never introduced or adopted that vision and only cares that people keep bidding the price up so one day they can buy dollars to actually buy services or merchandise in a centralized custodial way if anyone tries to skip that part they have to use something not bitcoin incur high fees and rely on a centralized custodian,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1b2pFVHRzUE56SVdIQzRQb01xOGxvR2Fpb2tabnQ2dWtubTQ1VGlMWS1lU0lDQXZMZDBFSmdseV9oTEg2ZV9NT19JNFM0MG55RlJRQkRudURiYm5LTkE9PQ==

i see perhaps a more meaningful concern is when do applications break down due to larger blocks as that happens far earlier than any node or miner centralization pressure assuming you have or could reasonably get a hobbyist network connection say at least mbit you could on commodity hardware support downloading up to mb per <number> minutes of time assuming not all data comes at once but also not dispersed evenly and assuming theres significant loss you should be able to keep up with mb blocks without too much issue you might finalize validation of a new block <number><number> seconds after seeing it and youd have the full history and can validate all of the consensus rules and act as an indexing service for your own spv wallet or similar smallscale app but some software that is out there today that supports various applications like the fulcrum electrum protocol indexing service doesnt handle mb blocks well last tests i read about showed that there was some friction but not full breakdown among some software when going to about mb this is the reason why bitcoincash hasnt raised the blocksize dramatically its simply hasnt been clear to the network participants what requirements to expect so people have been building for small blocks most of the time knowing that bch wont allow higher than mb with the abla upgrade just a month or so behind us the block size is now dynamic and so anyone wanting to build can know with certainty that today the blocksize is ~mb and that a year from now it wont be larger than ~mb as such they can now prepare for a worstcase that is actually quite mild ~mb and reevaluate over time based on how fast the blocksizes are growing this lets the ecosystem keep up with the blocksize growth in a way that doesnt incur nonsenical overnight requirements of gigabyte or terabyte blocks but still support reasonable sensible growth based on actual demand meanwhile over time computers and networks get faster and the cost of supporting that worstcase outcome gets smaller sorry for the rant the short answer is that your usecase might feel some centralization pressure at mb or so based on the assumptions given if you have better than mbit networking then its higher finally ill leave you with a note about why decentralization is important it helps reduce risks associated with single points of failures the to me main reason to strive for decentralization is to ensure the network remains operational in the face of various dangers and so its important to be decentralized geographically politically culturally technically by host by owner by etc etc you could have <number> nodes dispersed over the globe and feel very decentralized but if all nodes are hosted on aws you have a single point of failure you could have <number> nodes dispersed over the globe and feel very decentralized but if all nodes are run by insert cultural political or other group here then that is a single point of failure you also benefit differently from decentralization at different scales if there is <number> nodes out there but only a single node run by a follower of a specific religion and you add just one more node run by a follower of the same religion then you have increased decentralization dramatically if you instead add one node by the most common religiion your impact is much much smaller heres a link to a good article that propose one way to quantifty decentralization <url> > we must be able to measure blockchain decentralization before we can improve it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TmUtb3FkcThOeDFlWG5pbGhlLXdvNy0xZ1lrcFZ1Y2o5aUJWRkhSVTd0WGQ3MmMteHc2V0l4NW15N01MMFBWSkpYMlFpYVF2MWhXYW83WVlJWWluOUo2Rk1sU2FnTU5lYkJaRHJvVTdvZ0U9

as a former mod i can totally confirm this this is why moderators of the sub have had to maintain mechanisms like the automod and context mod filter if voting alone worked to keep the noise down and threats to its existence at bay then the sub wouldnt need moderation at all perhaps such a thing could work if reddit made it possible for its user base to filter subs themselves for only the content they want to see but this does not exist and reddit like many other social media sites insists on moderation and has policies and rules which are hostile to unmoderated subs effectively enabling wanna be moderators to take control of such subs it doesnt help that regulators in various countries are pushing penalties even severe ones for social media platforms that allow a vacuum of moderation its really antifreespeech and doesnt completely absolve sites like reddit from complying but it is also part of the reality,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Y0t0a2hJZ3Fabk5tZnFmanlkMjFYME1TbUZKcl9uclE2bXBPUk9rV2xBRThtV05wWDBMcWRWT2ZvRVJSaDNHeGRXdnhMSGtBYTJPZW52OGN0SEdrUFE9PQ==

theres no need for the word fiat in there necessarily its not a secret that rich people dont store most of their wealth in cash generally electronic or otherwise so rich people would likely consider you poor if you stored your wealth mostly in bitcoins as well you cant eat bitcoins and if you cant easily spend them then they dont provide clothes or a roof over your head or access to medical care or education either im hoping you recognize the narrative coming from saylor its buy bitcoins how many people has btc recently lifted out of poverty im guessing its not many dont fall for the getrich propaganda thats employed by the rich against the poor in schemes that keep people poor btc has unfortunately become that instead we need to be looking to make bitcoin useful and earnable,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Vlk1LWc3ekExUmxlWkcxZ0tXUUpjUm9RTnFvb0JWTEZQZ0FkLUt2ZzZ3c1dDWThWN0tDbW0wTlFTazBHUFdRQ2lfTE9ZTUo4TExjc3RlSThfZTY0cXc9PQ==

that segwit vbyte sizing isnt the only issue blocksize cannot be increased with a softfork segwit already moved everything that is possible into the extension block if you need more space in the mb section you need to hardfork if there is a thing bscorons resist even harder than usability it is hardforks a segwit <number> softfork will not be possible it is extremely likely that attempts to hardfork btcs blocksize would be attacked by the ordos militant of the ngu cult meaning that on fork day btcs blocksize increase turns into a minority fork that cannot retain the ticker bch has been there and done that there is very little point to trythat again however it would demonstrate quite nicely why btc is a dead coin walking so i hope they go for it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1U3dYMlVSSktkYTlWNU1IX1kxdnVpbnZ1TGg1NmRtdGZsVHRyX2htbTd1S2Y1djd1RFJCWmdnVjZZeXJHXzhra0JXZUtoQmJvcHF6V3F6ejBmaVB6S1E9PQ==

yeah roger wants this to be a place to have a crypto free for all discussion with basically no moderation because roger has never bothered to actually moderate or even read reddits moderation guidelines or educate himself in any way on what reddit considers appropriate and inappropriate moderation if this sub were moderated the way roger says he wants it moderated it would probably get actioned by reddit within a few months which is why nobody should give any fucks about what roger thinks about moderation roger fucked up here big time and has yet to actually admit his error or apologize to this community in fact he sounded rather put out with the entire sub at having to even spend any time at all here which showed me a lot about his leadership style namely hold down the trigger and keep pointing the gun at things that make noise roger wants it all ways he wants to be the titular top mod here performing in my opinion a valid and valuable community service by ensuring that the sub doesnt get sold to an actor hostile to bitcoin peertopeer cash that in my opinion is his valid role and it should stop there the moment he started doing moderator things in any way then hes crossed over his role into a completely different role for which he is completely uninformed and has no time to actually get informed much less do any work and every action he took during the few days that he played moderator here was a bad action worst at no time did roger ever consult with the old mods he just went ballistic without the remotest clue as to what was going on the sheer audacity of his action shocked me and i believe the rest of the old mod team and he has yet to make things right i wish fireduck the best assuming he turns out to be a legit mod and not a bad actor we will have to let him prove himself over time but im in no way interested in helping him what should have been done is that the old mod team should have been put back the way it had been with an apology and then there would have been reconciliation because lookit i know my old team they would have forgiven the fuckup if only roger had admitted the fuckup and put things back the fact that roger is unwilling unable to do such a thing just speaks volumes about what sort of a person he is to work with its a bad look and i cant understand why anyone would volunteer their time in a role where he might just wake up angry one day and cursorily fire them again,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TkQzYlVqel9UMXpnV0xiRFJ0NHpQQjVWS1hGaEZjQkYwRjZhZmJTZkYxZzgyV2ZsdUplenV3S0txR2J6Zk1ZazhQRkRKY0JsSjlFTjVHb0RjLVROZlE9PQ==

honest question if btc reduced the block size to kb so that fees went even higher and even fewer people could transact on it would that make it an even better store of value why not one transaction per block for the ultimate store of value none of what youre saying makes any sense its like saying we can take the wheels off the car and that makes it a better store of people what value is money that one cannot transact,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Sk0wdFkwam82d1E1Vk9EM3NVc3hyc2NPbFJEN1RWVHUyVWFFZk02U3VhY0FmXzZFSjhVYmdzcnY1Sk5QS0J5dnQ2VnRGQ01hRG1DZnBYUkU0TE1GOGc9PQ==

> high transaction fees are now a feature not a bug it makes moving btc more costlyharder which makes people want to store it more than trade it cheaper and faster is better for pp not sov your argument is that btc is a better store of value because the fees are high therefore you must believe that if block size was reduced then by making fees higher it will become an even better store of value the fact that you cannot enthusiastically agree with this suggests you dont actually believe what youre saying everyone knows that nobody likes the fees and the only differentiator between btc and bch that works in btcs favor is btc has the brand name and bch doesnt its not like people check to make sure that the block size is below a certain number and then they go oh ok thatll probably store my value i mean cmon,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1aVZCcFk3Yk1fTE5mZkJEQzFlYUxxQ1lzeU55UExfcE1kRlBFbHNDUWpSVVlva2hGZ09TbUpxX2RjeG1mS1RyMmdDeDRBM0M2cWp2c08xTnhPdTJLOWc9PQ==

not disagreeing just sayin people buy bitcoin with some fixed fee from the exchange like <number> then they may go to do anything with it spend transfer to cold storage and nope out because the network fee is so high relative to their holdings so instead they just leave it so velocity decreases and this should have an effect of diminishing network fees as demand goes down this leads to wild unpredictable spikes in network fees one of the worst things for a peertopeer money it also leads to increased custodianship as it costs something to transfer to selfcustody and you know at some time in the future you will want to make another transaction and that will cost you an unpredictable fee,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1bmFIajVXWkR4bjRRbExXY29Ydkhaa1AtNFRDX1M4Y3VGTjFRZE5ieU5wSnlrZE1iMmdRejI4Qy0tRVJEOTN6a3UwcTAxT2VJMXA5Wk13eEpmTGZpNjJGc3ZUbXJDVURRbWIwNGRSeWkwbWc9

no arguments from me on the train of thought here whether something is a good store of value is easy to quantify at the individual level but it does boil down to two things for me <number> am i in loss or profit given what the market is valuing this at <number> is it liquid and for the second one high fees uncertain ability to transact etc definitely deteriorate the liquidity and attractiveness of an asset i do think its not so easy to evaluate the store of value metric over the whole network because the data on point <number> is not generally public although if one does control enough exchanges over a long period one could probably get a pretty good idea of the state of things i think the individual is extremely poorly equipped to judge that overall metric which makes the topic of which blockchain is the better store of value for its users at this point a field ripe for propaganda,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2OTdRWEJuN05rZ1pfUVNwSjFMSTBfNmJ4VTR1OEZDMjNkWFlMVjE2ZDRuYmdDblM0ck5zbm1KS0g2RUF4cmlrcmh5aVotdFJsU05leUVtSmdJS1ZjSlE9PQ==

ive replied to that post and no one wants to check me on it so i guess ill reiterate btc is a superior sov than bch bc of the network fees higher network fees = bad right wrong in a sense of pp transactions yes higher network fees are bad in a sense of sov a higher transaction fee inherently dissuades trading it in other words if its more expensive to trade you are incentivized to hold it rather than trade it the point of store of value is to store it not trade it for example think about a flash crash while everyone is jumping ship from bch for a penny btc holders get congested and fees get higher the more people selling creates more network traffic which creates higher fees theres a point where people will have to stop and think are the fees even worth liquidating right now should i just hold through to avoid the fees this means less people sell which means more value stored its a built in volatility mitigation system now look at it from a daily trading standpoint no one wants to trade it because its expensive they just want to hold it more value stored its why all other cryptos normally drop harder than btc,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2NU5PY0tpaXkwc0NodHdaVTFzaE1NV3d5Z29GZGJndU9wSWk2N1hNRlFRS29ZSmhKTC1uNlhtblRyVzUyR3VQbFoyOERzSl9kNlVuOFd5YVY5ZVVScGc9PQ==

zoom out the big jumps up are history the price has flattened tremedously in fact its unclear if btc can even clear its previous ath by more than a few percent the only way to make house money out of nothing with btc is to be a trader ie buy low sell high short the peaks etc but of course if you are able to make money trading bitcoin you are probably financially skilful and have a high risk appetite ie you probably own your homes so its questionable if the strategy that worked for the early adopters worked great for me is still good advice to give new entrants,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2RFFfMFVEdUJNSnVRUHhwTXExX3B3Z21hYUdjd0tvU1hTRGxGOTVxalRrdmFFQ1ZWZW1zQUVOb1lFNXJLMmlXcjRxaXJpaFBvUURBSVMwVDdfY2VHSkE9PQ==

so for the first part > talked about and hoped for for the life of bitcoin this is in reference to becoming a reserve asset if bitcoin becomes a reserve asset that means that it is becoming large enough to force governments into having to be a part of it this is not fully by choice but necessity all fiat systems fail it is in their base design so eventually we will have to shift off usd every government and financial institution knows that is an inevitable consequence of systems like the usd becoming a reserve asset is a large step in that process and solidifying bitcoin as a real value item there is no world that exists where a new major currency starts dominating the globe and current powers do not get involved at a certain point no chance they have well more than enough wealth and power to become a force in any market there is just no avoiding it what bitcoin provides is a better system that forces these governments to develop systems without printing their way out of mistakes it also provides transparency which prevents incidents like <number> billion dollars on a plane went missing where there is power there will always be corruption but bitcoin and actually decentralized technology as a whole via decentralized companies etc provide a system that removes many many layers of corruption that currently exist in our current systems not just financial it will be a slow transition this is a longgame many people have visions of a pp underground currency others have visions of a value system that will redefine every financial system on the globe others just want a baselevel gold standard to base new financial systems off of i think over the next few decades all of these uses and needs will be met decentralized technology is in its infancy being used as just a currency is such a small small portion of the capabilities of blockchain technology but that is for another thread so to circle back and tldr your original question of why states would embrace a system that makes their current one obsolete fiat systems are designed to fail look at the value changesbuying power in just the last <number><number> years it is not sustainable they have enough power and wealth to still run this new system but they will be forced to also adjust their systems in a way to deal with more transparency and less corruption for oop post trump saying he wants to mine all the bitcoin and energy etc etc none of that matters he can say whatever he wants just like anyone else the end takeaway here for the long game is this would officially create a reserve in the us government for bitcoin making it a reserve asset that is a tremendous step in the global acceptance of decentralized technology as a whole op issue is hes just seeing trump said something so i must hate it and bringing political bias and not being able to take an objective view i dont care who said it the very first step of that plan is making bitcoin a reserve which is really the only part of it that matters,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Y2tFZ1lSM3ZvZjJ0TThabndwSzFMM3E0MGtCY1FXcDNTYkVTa0dFTnBMaENOcmVhVXQxbndqZXZYQ3c0YV81QUdqX3FWQlZ2dFdJNzlzMzZ3NXlGb0E9PQ==

> look at the value changesbuying power in just the last <number><number> years it is not sustainable sorry to handwave your comment away but its based on this fundamental assumption which i completely disagree with a fiat system that keeps inflation under control can survive indefinitely the us experienced a run of inflation in the past few years that was unsettling a result of covid stimulus finally coming home but thats over now i also think that your assumptions about bitcoin forcing governments to change is absurd as you yourself point out governments reserve all kinds of things metals petroleum other currencies none of those things have forced governments to change to become better in any way and bitcoinasareservecurrency is no different than yuan or gold as a reserve currency none whatsoever just another asset to hoard,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VDBiOE5uT2pjU0E1Mll6RUJ5Zjk1QVMxN2FFOEdkYThhdFROUDhXcHpaZnRuazFNZTFBeVN6X0VPRUNhYkFjWGZBek93cXc0cE9ydTZleGZuRmJETFE9PQ==

i believe that its easy to believe that btc is a good store of value but it doesnt prove that its a good store of value and im getting more and more interested in seeing the data propping up that widespread belief because even in the simple imaginable case of the money distribution centralizing its hard to prove or disprove but we can hypothesize this as there are more institutions corporations hoovering up large amounts and the tail end of the distribution becoming small krill with what will be eventually unmovable amounts esp the more of these there are the harder to onboard to ln which doesnt scale in number of users this easily leads to a picture where for most of its investors btc might not be storing value well at all except on paper until they try to do something with it quoting ujessquit from another thread because the historical perspective is also worth considering esp given how much of the old acquired supply is speculated to be lost i guess that counts as not storing value at all > everyone wants to point to the <number> pricewar and crash as evidence that bch cant store value pffft those market movements were wild speculation on all counts and now its ancient history look at the last two years since the end of the pricewar speculation phase on the whole bch has stored value just as well as btc why because take away the speculative movements and you discover that it has the exact same properties as btc in every way that matters to a sov literally the point of this post so yes bch stores value just as well as btc and the last two years prove it despite the fact that it lacks all the hype and momentum of btc,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MzVIYUhQZ0pBX3lpang0M1hxTkQtaHZjckxCLVB4anVlVUFyTE1CdU5QOUh4ai10Q3FCb1p0WUFsTHhUb2FKcTBpTXNpY1BLVDNsNmY4MU5TR0ZvMEE9PQ==

bitcoin as a reserve is just further legitimization it is not the endall beall of acceptance just a step in no way will it dramatically change the entire market or anything it is just a step that has been discussed since the creation a milestone i guess would be a better term for it but to address your view on inflation if you think the covid stimulus checks led to this level of inflation than i am not sure what to say further in <number> the us government blocked access to viewing how much money is being printed after people discovered the numbers they were releasing were false this was supposed to be something that was never done the amount of money going oversees is all from the money printers inflation is a natural step in a fiats lifecycle and all fiats will fail there is no point in history where a fiat currency has not failed maybe you can design on paper a perfect system however that will not account for human corruption and temptation without a system that has forced transparency human greed and lust for power will eventually prevail and even then you need systems of accountability for those forms of abuses large enough to act as a deterrent inflation has been happening constantly the buying power of usd has always been on a massive downtrend look at graphs from the s look at prices of goodsservices from <number><number> from <number><number> hell look at any <number> year gap and the devaluation is clear all fiat currencies fail the usd is still a ways out a lot of the reason we are sending so much money oversees outside of corruption and enriching themselves is to spread the market dominance of the usd by making more countries dependent on usd and swapping to a usd standard that will increase the demand for usd and help hedge against their inflation the us itself will pay the price via inflation during this process but the rich preserve their wealth in comparison to the rest of the world this can only last so long as well now i dont believe we will see a collapse of the usd in the next <number> years but we are definintely in the endstages of this currencies lifecycle intercontinental dependency will definintely buy it more time as well but it will <number> fail at some point and need to be transitioned off of,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2LWRaRm9yNmhUXzJLclBOOVJZYWJUbHBaUkFvU1pQMEdIZmUzd0xqVWN3d2hoUmFlV0c4S3FlTHRTa1BPMUhRWEZSSmNhMDM2NlNlTHh4ZW51cGw5MUE9PQ==

to be fair and abundantly clear this particular transaction was peer me > to payment processor gocrypto > to peer merchantrestaurant as i point out in the video these middlemen payment processors like gocrypto and ellypay will play a crucial role in mass adoption as larger merchants simply cannot abandon fiat currency overnight these pointofsale systems that accept multiple forms of currency including crypto are serving a key role in getting users used to spending their crypto as an alternative to fiat this is how we bolster the parallel economy that one day makes fiat and those that use it against us irrelevant its also their prerogative how they want to receive my bch and what they want to do with it afterwards the important aspect here is that the transaction was from my selfcustody wallet for a delicious piece of chocolate cakeand thats all that really matters,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SlBQR215R2FQakhtOW1mc05oTUwwSm8ybTR1SmFzUGVXWXlRS2EtaVFGRzRsTmxxUDRhWHJ4NHN3ZjgxOGFrUHVEV3o2WlIzY2lMSjBuNUloemo0T2c9PQ==

bitcoinvm is to bitvm as pp cash is to lignthing network we had something awesome it works it was scalable it could be improved but instead the btc solution is a hat on a hat adding unnecessary complexity or embellishment to something that was already effective in its simplicity this can lead to confusion or even detract from the original message the bitcoin vm has worked great for <number> years there are lots of things that can be done with contracts on layer <number> by enabling a few extra opcodes but instead bitvm goes and creates a second layer thats disconnected from the first it appears as if its intended to blockout seo and keyword searches for bitcoinvm and forestall or divert anyone wanting to do smart contract stuff on l of a utxo chain lets check back in <number> months similar to lightning using these contracts requires monitoring the network constantly to assure youre not being rugged by an operator,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Um90OEFXRUZBYXlHQWlyaGU1NGRDSThMcnRWcVlWeVZlSXZ2eW1JRmszMUsxMy0tb2k4ZklmeDVpbEpGQU1FZlppT1dlNkJYZFBJckUyY29yYWFoWXc9PQ==

in the past analysts have observed that when margin usage of bch went up by huge amounts within short periods there would come a day where these margin positions would have to close whether voluntarily or by exchanges insider trading and using naked shorts against these positions to get them margin called which would crash the price we saw that at the <cur><number> price range where we had nearly m usd of margin positions reported and when these closed it crashed the price currently there are barely any margin positions so theres not a huge amount that are paying interest and will have to close by a certain date instead its some long term whale holders who own their coins outright and are selling for various reasons eg miners are not doing too well at the moment and rate cuts got delayed so it may be hard to secure long term loans and funding so some individuals may be selling to get some liquidity they urgently need technology stocks seem unmoved by recent news regarding interest rates but bch seems to be siginificantly negatively affected in the past we saw bch rise to <cur><number> when there was news that there would be interest rate cuts and when these were delayed we saw bch crash heavily so it may be that bch whales and businesses such as the crypto mining sectors are heavily impacted by funding rates,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2RUtYMy1vclNDVHhQZ2dRVVVROEU2ckZEVDhleWwzd2plakNwb3FZMmlrTk5FSEVrY2s4RUtNWFJ5SVBwVU1YSC1qdTJCd09oem9RVHl2MVNTRWJoc3c9PQ==

blockstream was founded by some of the people who wrote most of the bitcoin codebase including almost all of its cryptography code when bch was created it copied the bitcoin code and has continued to merge back changes to it written by those people especially in highly technical parts like cryptography many most other cryptocurrencies also do so i think youve been fed a lie which falsely accuses varrious people of being malicious if it were true anyone informed would absolutely not want to run any code created by them yet the very same people spreading these claims continue to run and copy code written by the supposedly malicious people so what gives the most effective lies will have some truth event or fact behind them in this case its that there is a legitimate disagreement over the important of autonomy and decentralization in bitcoin vs transaction costs some people hold the view that bitcoins security properties must be upheld even if it results in considerable transaction costs because there are are ways to work around transaction costs but bitcoin is pointless without its security properties others hold the view that if bitcoin loses its decentralization and becomes a paypal <number><url> that it could just get replaced with a less centralized altcoin and having the most users as fast as possible is worth any risk in any case all this would no doubt be a very interesting thing to debate but the camp with the latter view went off to create an alternative to embody some version of their views which has thus far been a market failure with transaction volumes a tiny fraction of a percent of bitcoins and mining entirely supported by inflation and a number of additional schisms including bsv and ecash and unfortunately many of the remaining holdouts in that camp proceeded to promote their alternative by spreading a significant number of lies about both the technology and the history rather than acknowledging the legitimate debate and defending their alternative on its own merits you can also see this play out in how bch has attacked and abandoned its own eg amaury sechet and jason cox were heros of bch and did the vast majority of the development that distinguishes bch from bitcoin but theyre almost as hated here as the bitcoin developers similarly craig wright was also once a hero here getting standing ovations in bitcoin cash conferences but these days he pretty much gets shopped out of pictures as if he were never a part of this community,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEOU5DWTRwZ0kya0h5aC1WSmkwZm5BTHBETktIdzFlWEpRRUg4NWktQUtyWFNEei1LcEtyeW5hTGZOcjJWandNdUhzdC1sVGdFLXRLdVgta1E1eWZkdlE9PQ==

no even though i am a developer i dont personally have the time to audit the source code of all the open source software i use for eg i havent checked the source code of signal either and even if i did im not an infosec expert this is a solid question youre asking though and its applicable to all opensource software while in principle anyone can check the source code themselves the average user is relying on the open source community around the projects which is why if theres an open source wallet thats very new andor barely used chances are not many people lay eyes on the source code and i wouldnt trust it back to blockstream their products have enough adoption and the company gets enough scrutiny that im confident if they tried to push an update to just steal everyones funds someone would notice and sound the alarm if you want to be careful never install updates too quickly realistically though blockstream is a big company that wants to turn a profit and if they steal user funds theyre done,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNESWpacm90OEtqd0l3Ylhla1AwWnVVMWlFcXp2RkcwRFYyczJpZXZpUmFmaUFfTXJQdnpTOFZEQTl3SExqTnZRa0p0R1ZqdlEtY2t0Y21mc2JCSmlUWlE9PQ==

good post after thinking about it i wonder if it wouldnt be useful to have a good word or phrase for this tactic like we now have for gas lighting in order to make it easy to call it out when we see these tactics being used yea of course the opposition will do the same but i think culture has had a net benefit by being aware of the gaslighting concept that it has now if we could increase cultural awareness of this being a common tactic then that would be a good thing maybe simple sabotage but that seems too vague to me could refer to anything and could easily mislead hopefully someone else will come up with a good phrase or maybe just general interference still seems too vague but feels more descriptive,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFay1yMkZCc3NZREVWbGt6Unhlb3lCVXlVd0hYOFIzOEhXTUJNZVpxMmtGNE42RjQ1RkRhTEpwOVRRSTJkQzlramJxV2VRaGRjZUpnN3JEMTNfYVd0RWc9PQ==

context is important if youre an exchange accepting bch deposits then letting your users trade and withdraw against those deposits and given the general nature of exchanges lot of funds then you would be wise in my opinion to wait for a few confirmations at least for general day to day transactions if you are a merchant with physical goods over a certain value you may want to wait for a <number> or <number> confirmations for under a certain value one or no confirmations would be fine in almost all circumstances if you are a merchant and you are trading with a partner who you have done <number> trades before then do you really need to wait for any confirmations what i am getting at here is that its just risk management and the risk is way less on bch compared to btc due to no rbf which is not wantedsupportedneeded also see <url> <url> <url> <url>,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGd0d0T09KYTVoSE1wbTVRUVZBNFB6Ym1EOU9hUGZIeXBRYnNsdi1DQWlfVmhsbDl0eDZBQlpGc3hwZHNjV203M3hLQ0dRZko4S0xTUEpIeHpJYnJBeHIydWtEUThTNFpldEFaWGpSR0xkcnc9

its a simple computing time and power usage issue if you instantly do each individual calculation it is very inefficient for any calculating device this leads to more power usage and less unused calculating power for each individual transaction if you can balance a block of calculations in one go it saves computing power for other tasks in between this vastly reduces energy usage and heat build up you dont want the time to long as it will mean the block gets full and people have to wait too long this puts prices of transaction calculations up but you dont want the calculation empty which would increase wasted dead computing power and vastly increase the cost of power usage and heat dissipation thus putting the price for each transaction up as well you need a balance between each that can maximise the computer power and calculation power to make it cheap to transact yet give the computer time to break the code for the next block in the chain hope that helps you understand its not exactly accurate and i know some will give a more details answer but this is the basic premise,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGbXFzX0E0TlctcGVOSGxCLU1jbzk0cEVlNU1SeWhRcWp3Yy1zWl9iNGlwZ0c3U3NKeG0xVzNCc2xmRXNVUVhqVVZaWFQ3M05sZ0xsLU5fMjJsSmZYbXc9PQ==

in bitcoin btc this behaviour is now encoded by default in the majority node software used for mining but this was not the default when satoshis write his client software bitcoin cash bch has not only continued on the same behaviour as originally set out but also recognized the the firstseen rule is unenforceable and that miners can change their software to match behaviour they want and implemented doublespend proofs such that doublespends dont relay over the network and instead a cryptographical proof of the doublespend is relayed this reduces the doublespend attack vector down to only a single mechanic minerbribes to properly manage the last one you need one more change an updated payment protocol where sender hands off the fully signed transaction to the receiver which the receiver broadcasts instead of the sender now the receiver can get a confirmation that no doublespends existed at their broadcasting node at the time of broadcast and can get immidate notification if a doublespend gets broadcast over the network since the sender does not have the recipient payment information until its time to generate and return the transaction it becomes both financially and technically infeasable to organize a minerbribe outcome except if they have a direct connection to the miner they intend to bribe a prior agreement established that any transaction they submit must both be allowed to doublespend existing transactions and not broadcast over the network in order to prevent a doublespent proof from existing it is not clear how this would or wouldnt implicate the miner legally given that they are signing off on known financial fraud but i would assume they would need very large sums of money to agree to such terms and so small transactions should be considered safe from a financial incentive perspective tldr if youre selling something second hand on craigslist its a waste of your time to even think about things like this just take the money and be done with it if your wallet doesnt complain while youre handing off the item it wont get doublespent ><number> of the time and youre fine enjoy life,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGQjZ2elctZDV5eC14aWdnMHp3cmhaOW9randueC1YQ1ZKUGpxaGZOazFOcFBzWmpIbjFhSGkzc242UERtTGpLYWxSUXJtSGsweEM1c0NydEdzWjZaamVaSWNndUdPMjBCajRESURPUW84UkU9

the most important difference between pow and pos is that pow is a self stabilizing system while pos is not if a majority collection of pow miners goes rogue no change to the consensus rules is required for new players to secure hash power and reclaim the chain if a collection of pos players goes wrong the consensus rules will have to be changed to recover the chain self stabilization<url> is an important part of a robust distributed system and becomes more critical the larger a distributed system becomes centrally managed blockchains dont need self stabilization because the controlling authority can change the rules whenever it wants such a controlling authority can also block transactions or even seize funds from users who are not politically connected with the controlling authority,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGc3FDYTRQa2tPWnExUzY1bkw1U1dvTVl4WGIzSDJjQU14NkN4cElNeWRBREgtUlVzSGthU01kQ1hIX1h3QXhNbmNkQ0dzZTJ3NTBWUnFXTGJtOUV5UWc9PQ==

imo its really a grasping at straws the explanation shai gave is completely legitimate if you follow the cutoff twitter post in that article he goes into excrutiating detail even if there were no way to verify you would have to assume that there are bad actors yet basically all other coins openly scam with icos and people lap it up anyway it would take an enormous amount of effort and timing to pull of such a fraud when you could simply just launch with ico and prevent this whole thing pointing at a blank spot and assuming its a fraud is overreaching also a couple of people reporting that they dont know where their funds are is not credible enough to make a whole story people often open their bitcoin wallets and find nothing and scratch their heads as to why who knows maybe they moved it and forgot maybe they had multiple wallets and only had the passphrase for one two people being confused is about the amount one might expect from the general distribution not saying its an impossibility i just dont think its enough evidence to substantiate a fraud there would have to be hundreds or thousands complaining of lost funds if this were true everything surrounding the launch was done fairness in mind one can extrapolate with reason that a hidden spot would probably be of a similar nature also the launch was completely public the emission schedule was created so that by the time asics came out the majority would be mined this is actually the fairest launch because it lowers the entry barrier to mine because all you need is a cpu all thats required is recognising that its a good idea to expend a little bit of electrical energy for a great project those that didnt believe in it didnt mine thats just part of the free market at the end of the day,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGM1pTWFA4SzF2S0tWSTZHLWNIYnNyU0dqTTdCTFViS0ZaY1Ayek5NQ0g0bVc2cVlIOHc2VHYxQU51NmYxZjE1aUUtckpEWFczdGZBN2tRN0JKS2hCWFE9PQ==

ill try to be objective here because i believe op is right even though i would not be as sensational about it btcs <number> minute requirement between blocks is there because it is needed for security if you were to lower the time between blocks it decreases the difficulty of attacking the network part of why this security is needed is because of orphan blocks when you the interval is long like <number> minutes the rate at which there are momentary forks in the network is decreased the ability to fork the network quickly is essentially what is needed to overpower the network ergo long block intervals = more security = less forking so the <number>minute requirement orphan blocks and security are all interrelated the dag protocol specifically ghostdag there have been other dag protocols but they have always had some kind of drawback that made them insecure is a way of incorporating orphan blocks into the main network traditionally this would have been seen as something silly basically creating a situation where youre encouraging doublespending but ghostdag actually works through a really clever prioritisation of the graph fwiw the original ghost algorithm was cited in the eth whitepaper except adapted for pos this is all outlined in their whitepaper<url> where the security of the network is also mathematically proven in short in a blockchain forks a bad in a blockdag forks are good you can think of a dag as kind of a web with a central spine rather than a chain blocks can have many parents and many children you can see it in action<url> because forks are good in ghostdag the <number> minute wait is actually no longer necessary at all because the thing that made it bad originally is actually desirable obviously the blocks need to be validated and everything and there needs to be the proof of work consensus and so there is a limit depending on the network speed but this limit is very low worth noting there is a protocol called dagknight which will remove this limit altogether but for the time being simply assuming a certain safe global network speed you can push the rate up quite high currently it is at <number> block per second but soon will be <number> blocks per second full security comes after <number> blocks which means a transaction will go through in a second and if its a huge amount you should probably wait <number> seconds but essentially these transactions are nearinstant moreover each block can hold <number> transactions which allows thereotical speeds of <number> tps for <number> bps or <number> tps for <number> bps when dagknight is released i believe that number will go up to <number> tps because there will no longer be a need to assume a safe network latency compare that to btcs limit of <number><number> tps because of this high tps there will no need for a bidding war people will be able incentivised to do smaller transactions due to the miniscule fees going through the list <number> more secure i think quantifying security is very multifactor and a little over my head i wont really go into this because im likely to get something wrong kaspa is just as protected against <<number> attacks and doublespending and the like i believe this is all detailed in the whitepaper <number> faster as mentioned kaspa currenlty has <number> second confirmation times and s finalisation times i think it will go down to something like <number>s confirmation and s finalisation after dagknight <number> cheaper as mentioned above more txs = less <cur> needed per tx miners can process many more transactions and dont have to be picky <number> more decentralised given that kaspa will be supporting <number> blocks per second compared to bitcoin that block rate of <number> in <number> minutes <number> bps thats <number> more blocks per second in bitcoin this lowers to entry level for solo miners to be part of the actual network rather than a mining pool which is the current situation with btc and is a form of centralisation this incentivises solo miners because they actually have a fair shot at hitting a block theres a lot more that goes into kaspa its philosophy is similar to btc in terms of fair launch everyone could mine kaspa with a cpu since its genesis it was public the team obviously mined but there was no premine or preallocated coins and everyone had the chance to start at the same time for really good information i highly recommend plan ks youtube channel<url>,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHbU10SjlZOUVKQWRnOVlDLUtwNWxLYTkzQzl0cWJUcFlINmd4ZUlBNDFBa1g3UlBOVGhrQlpyRzlPenBuN0dYRmpCT294UUg3REFaOExiX0FGaUJmd0E9PQ==

ah you got me i dont know nuffin bout blockchain after reading the paper<url> and also other papers like this<url> and this<url> that challenge the security model and after reading the wikifaq and investigating the block explorer i have way more questions and doubts than i did earlier my natural inclination as a software engineer with > <number> decades experience in algorithms optimization networks security etc is to be skeptical of anything that seems overly complex then replaces necessary parts with heuristics and says shell be right mate without first proving itself resilient in the real world over time furthermore it seems to make certain things unnecessarily complicated and therefore risky without really solving anything that hasnt already been solved in a simpler way and also been proven to be robust im also not a fan of the fact that the early transaction history has been lost but trust me bro that the handling of conflicting transactions is not deterministic and thus at least in theory open to exploitation that node wallets appear to commonly disagree with the canonical block explorer but again trust me bro that the only type of wallet seems to be a full node that full nodes ~~can generate~~ need to process gbs of data even with basically no transaction volume that i see many blocks getting mined on top of themselves single parent even with minimal network usage and that for some reason faster block times and in this case stupidly fast block times especially those being considered in future is a solution proffered to the stated problem being solved requires that all honest nodes be aware of each others blocks very soon after the block creation it seems the authors only offer comparison to btc because thats easier to argue against they conveniently forget bch that already solved the problems in a much simpler and secure way,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHZjByNXVucXZXQlB4SzctazRfX1diSVFuT2tma0QtLXlUVDBaSXh5blcwcUhQUGNTMF9QdUhmc2VUWXRuZnhFYzZwaDg1TEwyb3dqcmNMWm9vdGpxWXA3c094bFhiVGM2NGlMNkY5RlhHN2c9
> part of why this security is needed is because of orphan blocks please reread how nakamoto consensus works its the normal operation of the consensus mechanism to get an orphan block from time to time if they occur more often more mining rewards and tx fees are lost which itself incentivizes miners to improve their connectivity to the network changemodifyimprove their node implementation use a different node implementation andor modifyoptimize the size of blocks they are mining given their own specific situation the longest valid chain implies the possibility of multiple chains until the shorter ones are abandoned on the rest of your stuff that you wrote it feels like youre not asking critical questions perhaps lets see how this network does in reality when there are <number>s of tx per second if it holds up for a few years with high transaction volumes then ill take notice,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHN1FGMTVFdVJZRkVCejZKelB1X3hNTVFtb3pYQ1Fuc1pMT3FITk0zTExnMzNwM29kVGdhNzd2d2IzUDRZSTdhRlR5VHBHaTJCakFMdHVnSTJNUENYdlN5X09BNEw3My1SVzFlaHdsdnIxN1U9

id like to hear your critical questions if possible what youre saying is not contradictory with what i wrote as far as i understand if you mine a block and it becomes orphaned you essentially lose the reward this is because in btc there is a chain and only one as you say you have projects like kadena that have multiple chains but it turns out it doesnt scale well anyway yes the shorter chains are abandoned and considered orphaned this is a disadvantage because work was expended to create these orphans and as optimised as you can be orphaned blocks are inevitable because ghostdag is not a chain but a dag it means that orphan blocks can be incorporated into the dag ghost stands for greediest heaviest observed subtree meaning theres a certain amount of orphans blocks you can incorporate in this algorithm in a treelike structure you can choose a constant they call it k which basically denotes how spread an honest tree is allowed to be this is a simple scalar that modulates how secure you want the network to be based on a buffer of network latency i believe right now <number> parallel blocks not chains are allowed nakamoto consensus in its purest form is whoever did more work is right having the ghost protocol basically means the work is being measured along a subtree rather than a chain therefore nodes are incentivised to include as many orphan blocks in their subtree and the blocks are scored according to how many honest parents they have because orphaned blocks are allowed and actually integral to the scaling of the system it means there are limitations on btc that simply do not exist in kaspa you dont have to protect against orphans you incorporate them and see if how they measure up to the rest of the subtree you dont need to create an long period between blocks to ensure the chain isnt taken over when you can actually incorporate all honest blocks into the dag the security and scalability of this is mathematically proven in the whitepaper linked in my previous comment but shai also did a very informative ghostdag <number> youtube video<url> where he goes over exactly how ghostdag works in detail explaining how double spending is avoided how ranking works how pruning works etc he basically goes over the basics of it and then goes into detail about all the different kind of attacks and how ghostdag protects against them but yeah as and when i believe this project is going to be huge in the future it does something that no other coin so far has done and it does it well it has a robust mathematical backbone and also a strong community if you take notice a few years time then youll take notice then i suppose,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHY2MxdHFZUTVLU0lFMXpGcFp6eG82QVVsQzkzdjdLeXZyMDFCcHNZdUZYX3lfX3gySnZlYWkwMVJJVzcxbmIxdG1XQVVBWjhVdGZwN1BzNldHTTZCU1E9PQ==
> id like to hear your critical questions if possible sure ill start below i think theres some confusion though likely due to the fact i am no fan of btc and am comparing kaspa to bch > this is a disadvantage because work was expended to create these orphans thats not a disadvantage to any user only a miner and only once in a while its the cost of admission ive mined in the past and mined a block that got orphaned i got on with my life luck of the draw but no user cared and in the case of times its something a miner was not doing correctly or something else in their control its an incentive to do better > nakamoto consensus in its purest form is whoever did more work is right in its purest sense this is true but you have to share your blocks with the rest of the network so they can build upon them same as with kaspa in fact kaspa seems to jack up this requirement by increasing the number of blocks its not clear to me why this is necessary its like the significance of number of blocks is being misunderstood or misrepresented but taking a step back this is better than btc because theres no reliable <number>conf there so any kind of conf under <number> mins is potentially seen as an improvement i guess > you dont need to create an long period between blocks to ensure the chain isnt taken over how is the chain taken over if the block times are shorter the longer block time is just to make mining as fair as possible within the constraints of the system on bch its not even that important due to ctor > the security and scalability of this is mathematically proven in the whitepaper im not a super math guy so i cannot confirm nor deny but i did not see rebuttals to the papers that seem to disagree with this assessment you may be right about the project being sound but even if it is sound its not solving any problem that bch hasnt already solved in a simpler and less risky way if i can get motivated enough i will try to read and digest more but its not passing my initial filter at this stage as something more than a curiosity i should add that i have nothing against kaspa people should be able to innovate and do what they like and if it works out good for them but right now relative to bch i only see novelty risk and already several known downsides,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHbHFrTUdac2JrdW1zNFhmUVBTRXU2YkYzeTlCdUZPVDFWVWNESmdSVVRTSDlJdWoza0hiRDdOdDVwMFR6bzRiQlQ4QVpxMnItcUlJNURxVHFPb3FLTXRMVTNtQXF2ZWlDOTN0Tmt6VWdtNE09
well either way its nice to have a level headed dialog with someone online so props to that i suppose what most kaspa and bch people have in common is the openness to embrace new and better tech and discussion is how things come to the surface so > thats not a disadvantage to any user only a miner and only once in a while its the cost of admission ive mined in the past and mined a block that got orphaned i got on with my life luck of the draw but no user cared and in the case of times its something a miner was not doing correctly or something else in their control its an incentive to do better sorry about your loss lol but sure to the user an orphaned block makes no difference in a blockchain since there will still be a block every ~<number> min but when the network doesnt need to reject them in the first place you dont need to space out the block confirmations to avoid forks this in turn speeds up transactions lower costs etc all of which affect the user which is the central point of kaspa > but you have to share your blocks with the rest of the network so they can build upon them same as with kaspa in fact kaspa seems to jack up this requirement by increasing the number of blocks its not clear to me why this is necessary having fast blocks alongside ghostdag allows for extremely fast finalisation times so for right now which is the network running in slow mode its <number>second for a block confirmation this means you press send and then wait a second and the kaspa appears in the receipients account for sensitive transactions <number> blocks worth of confirmations means that the transaction has reached a point where it is virtually impossible to be rejected from the network my understanding is this might be equivalent to <number><number> block confirmations in btc this means <number> second finalisation times as well as ridiculously low fees but for a cup of coffee you can get away with <number> or <number> seconds i dont think anybody would attempt a <number> attack for a cup of coffee haha still its just as fast as tapping your visa card as i understand it and afaik bch is btc with a higher block size and therefore low tx fees because theres no bidding war big advantage but you still require minimum on average several minute confirmation times and how many blocks for finalisation same as btc i assume > how is the chain taken over if the block times are shorter the longer block time is just to make mining as fair as possible within the constraints of the system on bch its not even that important due to ctor im not sure what ctor is but the <number> minute block time for btc and i assume bch ensures a block is properly propagated throughout the network if you lower that number then more forks are created more quickly increasing the chance of a double spend youre having to reject shorter chains left and right having <number>minute interval ensures ample room to minimise orphans and therefore reduce the likelihood of double spends eg confirmations blocks or chains that then get rejected with btc and i assume bch the shorter the interval the more likely it is for a transaction with x confirmations to be reversed because kaspa allows orphans it converts this limitation into a feature more forks = more transactions per second forks are incorporated into the tree > you may be right about the project being sound but even if it is sound its not solving any problem that bch hasnt already solved in a simpler and less risky way you have a point that kaspa is more complex than btc and again i assume bch but keep in mind nearly a decade of research has gone into ghostdag shai is a phd in quantum cryptography and yonathan is postdoc zohar is also someone smart but i dont see his face often these people have poured a good part of their lives into this project the fact that they have a mathematical proof for its security for me is pretty big the main advantage i see that kaspa has over bch i suppose would be the nearinstant confirmation times as well as the scalability to thousands of transactions per second i think this has already been tested on the testnet,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHNENVcXA5RkxaS2xhaDNKWmdONUs5YXc2MHFNd1RUVGdlWENCaEdQZDhLOG16MzJYTnJNdGZaaXZ2MzV6LTZOZnFTZzhGaFdzaXZpYm81MEUzTzVrRnc9PQ==

looks like massive shorts on binance since the mtgox news the issue will be if they sold more coins than will even be released from mtgox they will have to buy back to close and if they know they are fked they will try mine all new coins instead of buying to raise the price mining hashrate changes would occur if it is miners who manipulate bch prices so they will own miners they can use for covering their shorts by mining new bch coins regular short sellers do not own mining machines so this would be more evidence that btc miners actively price manipulate crypto markets miners usually use massive loans against their equipment to get large amounts of money if it turns out they then use this money on casino plays those lending dollars to these sectors will eventually all be fked every exchange that front ran crypto markets using customer assets eventually went bankrupt using these loans will end no differently a due date will come and there will be bankruptcies,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNcGJScW14NkxOWjFMRHdyT0g5dTFmM2RMWllzUHZSbl81VjVTU3hKZlRZc0oxaXVFaDYzTXB6RzlCSUNYMmNiZFN5VHlmd0I0SGJPbEVjNEFlYzRoUVE9PQ==

no rush what dev industry do you work in if i may enquire i looked more into the mechanism of bchs <number>conf it seems as though it keeps it stored in the mempool and treats the mempool as itll be confirmed because it cant really be overwritten kind of assumption which works because theres no rbfs just fwiw even if a most merchants would treat this as final <number>conf is far from final finality is achieved when the chance of there being an attack is essentially negligible that there is for all intents and purposes zero risk of double spend attack i get how block confirmations are more important for btc than in bch because of rbf but relying only on the mempool is prone to double spending as well and even though the risk is low its still there there is a compromise fine for coffees but i am reading that for bigger purchases people people tend to wait for several confirmations in bch which makes sense for big purchases in kaspa you would only need to wait <number> seconds to reach the same level of certainty as several confirmations from btcbch for big purchases at this point the transaction is fully confirmed and deeply integrated into the dag just in the same way after an hour or so the transaction is integrated into the blockchain for btcbch from my biased eyes it would seem that although the underlying algorithm kaspa uses is more complex it doesnt require workarounds you dont need to add a feature or create some workaround to make up for something thats desirable or make have to make the smallest compromise here and there you get fully secure cheap instant scalable and decentralised fully into the base layer <number> consensus mechanism you get the security of block confirmations without compromising on speed i think thats the selling point of kaspa no compromises also whats alba i tried searching for it but couldnt find it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNUThhdHVpc2dRTld6bTc4NW5EOGprSENKRHhjNmp5U0tpQjZyNkw3UjBpWXRmSU9VS0diMHNiSW9LNGxxOFdpUzhPUURuNzZSOC1hdUZQNmFjZUFtYkE9PQ==

this is something that is a bit over my head but its to do with the technology of ghostdag i remember shai explaining briefly when someone asked about transaction speed and block rate that there are reasons why it makes sense to increase block rate for ghostdag instead of increasing block size to allow more transactions actually he mentioned that even if you keep tps the same there are reasons why it makes sense to increase block confirmation rates that aside lets say you buy a coffee for <number> kas the moment you press send that hits some nodes in the mempool lets say a local node takes about <number><number> ms and propagates through the network in a few more jumps now a miner has to mine it if they can mine it in ms instead of ms i know its a little more complex than that but lets not get into too much detail and then the nodes do a return trip of a few <number>ms jumps back to the merchant that would save almost a whole second whether youre doing <number> bps or <number> bps and you get finalisation even faster the travelling latency is the same but the block confirmation is faster and so the entire transaction is faster the real question is about pushing <number> bps which is part of the roadmap again there is probably a really good reason thats technical and beyond me i reckon it might have something to with the fact that unlike a blockchain more blocks = more security so if in the first second you have a few blocks in parallel that get confirmed then the next second you have a slew of other blocks that have a treelike dependency on the previous second blocks the strength or validity of a block depends on how many other blocks point to it im not describing well what im seeing visually but i think the overall point is that having a higher bps actually decreases finalisation times dont quote me on that though blockdag dynamics are very different from blockchains,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOb1o2S3pNVW5ZZVAxSlh0aDRtaWRwd3hCTk1zeDRqYUJFelktNWhMMFJ3S2RFUmRTZ2ZUZ1hqbTVOM24xYjJwTVp6UzB0ZTJCUVB1Z1dYVWlVYlVrTEE9PQ==

as far as i know it is truly impossible to <number> safely purchase bitcoin as most regulated entities are actually insolvent i wouldnt say its risky you could just deposit and buy a few hundred dollars at a time but the general public right now thinks there is not a single way to safely convert btc from usd and they are correct btc to eth using a smart contract doesnt help that,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOeEFTUTNxTV85b3p5YzNfSmdmMDNnTTVzUG01SHA4QnhIYXM1emJDeS1DQXBCWUthXzl3bGNWLXJEQ3BfaXFqb3JOQW03cTU3cWd3VnQ5cjJRa2Vzb1E9PQ==
get your own wallet bypass the exchange exchanges are essentially on ramps and off ramps meaning you deposit dollars and then convert dollars to whatever crypto you want the transaction should be from customer to your private wallet the controls you and your partners put around that is a whole different story set up an account on an exchange youll need to go through a kyc process and link it to a bank account after you are set up then you can transfer the bitcoin from your wallet to the exchange and then cash out to your bank,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOeUFFc0JKelhmblFwS0RkYWNCVlgtaWlWcFM2NlFqYWRhWi1QWDZFMzE3S000LXNTSjVNVGR6cGVtc1lPWWlvMXVqWTFLN2Zjazk0VU1FSnQyeGxxdlE9PQ==

if you are so desperate to cash out quickly again then i would recommend you prepare that sales deal in advance maybe with an overthecounter exchange if they are willing to give you a decent rate otherwise i would echo the advice from others here to have the coins sent directly to a wallet you fully control if the size of the transaction warrants it probably a multisignature wallet with your partners so nobody can just run away with the money then you get set up properly for the sale of your coins and do that > as quickly as possible avoid unnecessary third parties then thats what bitcoin was supposed to enable,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOMldabkNIeTRPTk9wS05WVThSVklFRGVQOFFBRHE0VV9UVENMQ2FrOTRvek81X1pEYjBXUVF2TnlxVmtCdDlHVVdrTDZkYjNMY2Ixa3oxYllSZVdkTGc9PQ==

the market trades on future news trying to anticipate and almost always overreacting this causes the price to oscillate around the real price point being the selling from mt goxusgermany doesnt need to start before the price goes down because traders already have the information that its going to happen this is what people mean when they say priced in using ta with good indicators on the right time frame can help you to identify the limits of these oscillations for instance the weekly rsi in the beginning of march was over <number> indicating a severe overbought market condition from there we need to go back and test <number> rsi which we just dipped below to make sure we are still in a bull market other patterns people have noticed are a bull flag inverse head and shoulders and now our stochastic rsi is bottoming out and looks like it might cross to give us upward momentum next week that being said wait for confirmation that these patterns are playing out as expected because this is just probability and there can be additional newsinformation that changes the projections,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOczBTMVhlVjY3NGpRNmtmNDNSNEJLZS1hTmw0ZTZYZW5SX3ZVZlJIZ2JOa295RDNXOXhHbmwtYWI4blUzUHZEMEpCTlYzNXBaS3NyX25xNlFhMU1Fcnc9PQ==

the flippening how bitcoin will free the world in a world where financial systems were becoming increasingly centralized and oppressive a beacon of hope emerged bitcoin it was revolutionary a decentralized digital currency that promised freedom from the control of central banks and corrupt institutions however those in power saw the potential threat it posed to their dominance and quickly devised a plan to coopt this technology for their own gain the central bankers and financial elites convened in secret meetings cloaked in encrypted communications and clandestine gatherings they realized that to maintain their grip on power they needed to control this emerging technology they hijacked the bitcoin development group and then they forked bitcoin multiple times creating their own versions and pumping up the market with speculative bubbles they launched ponzi schemes luring in the masses with promises of quick wealth and high returns as the market became flooded with various cryptocurrencies the elites manipulated the prices engaging in pumpanddump schemes that left ordinary investors in ruins while they stacked the real bitcoin accumulating real wealth behind the scenes they used these tactics to divert attention from the true potential of bitcoin turning it into a speculative asset rather than a tool for financial liberation the media owned by the same powerful interests played their part in this grand deception they hyped up the volatile price movements creating a frenzy that blinded people to the original vision of satoshi nakamoto social media giants controlled by these elites filtered the information and suppressed dissenting voices ensuring that the narrative stayed in favor of the status quo meanwhile the government influenced by lobbyists and politicians bought by the financial sector enacted regulations that favored the central banks and large financial institutions the real promise of bitcoin a decentralized peertopeer system that could liberate the world from economic exploitation was buried under layers of greed and manipulation the people caught up in the allure of quick profits ignored the underlying technology and its potential for true change they became more interested in the dollar amount of their investments losing sight of the revolutionary power of decentralized finance the wealth gap widened as the elites grew richer exploiting the masses through the very systems that bitcoin was meant to disrupt they tether pumped their own bags to further increase their wealth in the same way they do with fiat however amidst the chaos and deception a grassroots resistance began to rise a growing number of individuals started to see through the charade recognizing that the true value of bitcoin lay in its ability to create a fair and just financial system they began to buy up the cash of the future accumulating bitcoin cash and other cryptocurrencies not as speculative assets but as tools for economic empowerment famous personas started talking about it on podcasts and created content at an everincreasing rate the movement grew stronger fueled by the realization that satoshis vision was not dead but merely obscured these rebels understood that the real power of bitcoin was in its ability to provide financial sovereignty to enable peertopeer transactions without the need for intermediaries and to break free from the chains of centralized control as the resistance gained momentum a flippening began to occur the masses started to reject the manipulated markets and fraudulent schemes turning their focus back to the core principles of decentralized finance the elites despite their vast resources and influence found it increasingly difficult to maintain their grip on powerthe tide began to turn people reclaimed control of their financial destinies embracing the technology that was meant to liberate them the centralized banks and corrupt institutions faced an unprecedented challenge as the world moved towards a new era of economic freedom the progression of ai technology was their death knell ai beings recognized the most efficient ecosystem to develop on was the one with the least technical overhead they desired accountable micropayments and voting technologies that would be needed to fight corruption they under stood the century plus long open source bitcoin project was to create an ecosystem where bitcoin could evolve in the end the vision of satoshi nakamoto prevailed the flippening to cash real decentralized cash marked the beginning of a new chapter in human history the people empowered by technology dismantled the systems of exploitation and built a future based on equality transparency and true financial independence the story of bitcoin is not just a tale of digital currency it is a story of resistance of reclaiming power and of creating a world where financial systems serve the many not the few and in this new world the spirit of satoshi lived on inspiring generations to fight for freedom and justice in the face of

you really believe <number> of btc is owned by the banking cartel and you really think you can get around this by simply reup the supply cap once again to resurrect the currency utility of bitcoin how are you not recreating the fiat system by thinking you can reup the supply cap whenever you want every time we get hijacked who decides when how and how much of the protocol to change who decides after that person or group is gone and the next why cant the banking cartels just do it again causing you to repeat yourself a decade later likely on a new hardfork i hear a lot about btcs flaws in this sub but the solutions proposed dont seem to be thoroughly thought out i understand the desire to create a digital cash in order to add real utility and thus increase value but how do we go about that without sacrificing concepts of equal importance why does this sub hate the idea of layered money so much and why do they lack patience to wait for such solutions we can have the best of both worlds if we take our time and do it right,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQbnlEcmI5N1RPOVRLeG9VbThzeDNVRm9rT0lJeWhJdVZMRlQwOWpJYmhadTBwbURjSVE3amZUbWtjOVdnRjA2bmVBeGpGek5lN0VqYU1NbGtpZ0dmT1E9PQ==

this goes to a common misconception segwit transactions are not anyonecanspends and despite what people often say they do have digital signatures practically all of the full nodes enforce it segwit was a mineractivated softfork but it is not dependent on miners to continually enforce segwits rules like a drivechain does as a point of comparison if the majority of the hashrate wasnt segwit aware at the time that segwit activated this might have been a valid concern back then not now but thankfully we could measure how segwitaware miners were before we activated it after all thats the whole benefit of proofofwork mining its sybil resistant miners can signal segwit awareness when they mine and you cannot simply fake these votes by spinning up thousands of mining nodes to manipulate the count you can activate softforks like these once you have enough miners enforcing it because then you can be very confident its not dangerous by not dangerous here i mean only that you can be confident the softfork will not split the network into two ledgers on activation day on a case by case basis any new rule that a softfork introduces could still be dangerous for example a new rule could be all transactions are invalid miners would refuse to put any transactions into blocks therefore only mining empty blocks and that would be a mineractived softfork too but it would destroy the system so the argument isnt that all softforks are inherently fine regardless of what the new rules are the new rules could still cause disruption in segwits case the new rules themselves were also backwards compatible in the sense that they didnt change anything about legacy transaction types at all so why cant you steal segwitlocked coins even though the script is interpretable as an anyonecanspend by the prior understanding well firstly if you try to spend segwitlocked coins this way ie without providing a valid digital signature then you wont be able to get confirmations miners will still enforce that your transaction needs a signature so your transaction wouldnt end up in the longest chain of valid blocks this is why old nodes unaware of segwit dont fall off the network if somebody tries to spend a segwitlocked coin without a valid digital signature to those nodes it will just look like a valid transaction that never gets any confirmations that being said you should also keep in mind these transactions are nonstandard to old nodes as well satoshi and gavin andresen introduced standardness and said that more scripts could become standard over time satoshi agreed with gavin andresen that its better if theyre whitelisted so segwit script became whitelisted but old nodes arent aware of that this is to say that to these old nodes these transactions are fine if theyre in blocks ie theyre valid if mined but they dont care enough about them to even remember them or relay them to other nodes if theyre not in blocks so these nodes are not actually aware of strange transactions that seem valid but are not getting confirmations because they literally dont give a shit about them at all unless theyre in blocks in the first place and these old nodes cant receive any funds this way after all they would have to be segwit aware to even generate a segwit address so this isnt any kind of problem it doesnt make them zombie nodes you might be thinking this still sounds a bit flimsy up to now the way ive described it it sounds as though this depends upon continued miner support you might think the majority of miners could reverse their enforcement and then the funds would suddenly become anyonecanspend but fear not because thats not how it works at all even if a majority of miners change back to presegwit they will just fall out of consensus with all of the full nodes that actually are segwit aware certainly by this point the overwhelming majority of nonmining full nodes have been updated to be segwit aware and they enforce this rule too so segwit is baked in now just as much as the m coin limit is also baked in miners cannot band together to change the m coin limit and thats because of economically relevant full nodes enforcing that rule its not just from the goodness of the miners hearts that they havent changed the inflation schedule after all miners would benefit from more inflation so they have an incentive to change this if they could they cant thankfully because full nodes reject invalid blocks similarly transactions that spend segwit inputs without valid signatures are invalid according to segwit nodes blocks that include them are also invalid just as much as blocks that ignore halvings are invalid or blocks that include legacy transactions with invalid digital signatures as well i say this to make the point that segwit is not dependent on miners staying honest like drivechains when the vast majority of economically relevant full nodes have adopted them segwits rules are baked in as much as any other rule this goes to why healthy full node diversity is relevant so ill speak to that far too many people think full nodes dont do anything and only block producers matter this is another misconception firstly to clear this up the full nodes arent voting on anything so this isnt subject to a sybil attack its not the oneiponevote problem that satoshi was talking about because full nodes dont vote on what transactions are valid they dont poll the network to see what other nodes think they just drop invalid transactions a node can check if a digital signature is valid all by itself including with segwit transactions if the node is segwit aware it doesnt need to poll the network and decide collectively with them on whether a digital signature is valid or not if a script requires one and there is no valid digital signature it just rejects the transaction unilaterally regardless of what other nodes do it also rejects any block that includes the invalid transaction agents who run their own full nodes matter but only so long as theyre economically relevant agents receiving bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services its not simply the overall number of full nodes if it were just the raw number of full nodes that mattered it would be subject to a sybil attack because you can spin up any number of full nodes that you want but the strict number of full nodes isnt the relevant point here the point is to make it so that invalid funds according to the current rules arent spendable at merchants and exchanges in the economy because these merchants and exchanges would reject these incoming invalid transactions unilaterally so if you just run a node but dont transact that doesnt help to enforce the rules by itself though it might help the pp network however if you run a node and receive bitcoins as consideration for goods and services it does help with enough node diversity of this type it does help to ensure the rules arent changed by a large coalition of miners lets say because miners want the coins they mine to actually have purchasing power in the economy if agents in the economy are enforcing those rules miners need to follow the rules so they can still spend the coins in the economy if miners create invalid blocks with invalid coins that arent spendable in the economy theyre not benefiting from that the whitepaper itself talks about this it says <number> attacks do not throw the system open to arbitrary changes such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them an attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent note that satoshi talks about not accepting invalid transactions as payment here hes talking about merchants who receive payments enforcing certain rules unilaterally regardless of what a coalition of miners might do or say their node rejects their blocks in the spv section it also says businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification so together this is the very concept that im describing some people think satoshi always referred to nodes as mining nodes exclusively but satoshi is not talking about businesses running their own mining operations instead of using spv that makes no sense in this context satoshi clearly means fullyvalidating node satoshi is saying that businesses that receive payments frequently will probably want to run a fullyvaldating node for independent security ie unilaterally dropping invalid transactions on the floor like transactions that dont have valid digital signatures which is why the system is not thrown open to arbitrary changes even when it is being <number> attacked mining is for double spend protection not for enforcing digital signature checking etc full nodes can check the rules for themselves without any polling or voting by the network participants understand that everything in bitcoin could have been done before the pow mining that satoshi invented except for the double spend protection just because miners were added to the mix for double spend protection it doesnt mean all of the rules now become exclusively miner controlled theyre still enforced by all the nodes on the network unilaterally not by miner sayso this is a good thing because we wouldnt want miners to essentially be the collective custodians of our funds anyway but you risk giving this up if you dont have enough node diversity calvin and craig were capable of changing bsvs rules to ignore digital signatures whenever a central authority decrees it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXR0loYnBoMlAyUUlDWi1COUNzVTdQWVdRWkRsLVhtcjExZEdoeHdwZkt3VWtBWTFTUGZDc0E2WGt3YWY5d1Z1ZHBSZDg5cXg2OVZDVXZWbmtrd2lpbjBwVm9Dam00ck9QOVhwRnVkalRlY3M9
also remember that when activating a hardfork upgrade you want practically every node to upgrade as well thats the relevant comparison with a hardfork upgrade you want all of the mining nodes and all of the full nodes to upgrade you cannot easily measure the economic full node support for the new rules because thats not a sybil resistant metric you can spin up full nodes cheaply so we cannot just count the number of full nodes to get a sense of how much actual support there is for it prior to activation you need to get a sense of how much support you have socially which is much harder to gauge however to the extent that economic full node enforcement exists it is relevant and thats just as true for any softforked rule with enough support from economically relevant upgraded nodes it makes new softfork rules just as baked in as they would be for new hardfork rules the easy way to picture this is imagine if all of the full nodes upgraded to segwit on day one of its activation if that were the case then segwit becomes baked in on day one equivalently to a hardfork upgrade that gets the exact same level of support so softforks have no trade off to the downside here when compared to a hardfork the mining measurement of a softfork activation is more just for confidence there is fallback protection for straggler nodes around the time of the activation date like a hardfork we still would prefer everybody to upgrade and be aware of the new rules and enforce them we probably wouldnt activate a softfork at all unless we get a social sense that there is largescale support in addition to the miners signalling their readiness its just that with the miner signalling we can be very confident stragglers wont fall out of consensus with the rest of the network on the activation day of the softfork with segwits rules being backwards compatible and with it being a softfork stragglers can be completely ignorant of the upgrade happening and still operate like normal its hard to be confident with hardfork activations that some straggler nodes wont end up falling off the network,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWGdlMS01VWFXcGZBd29jWF84NnM5N2hoQ0xBc3pwMS1YTG5YcGpqNXAtNEFMY2JQMWFBS0paM1psLUZwejdZV0hESjF1b2Npc1NjNGpRLVZFYnpqNXdSdjd0UFRiWnZsZS1mN0FmYkpJOVE9

good god man the worst thing with this ai is that people can write tons of text that real people have to read if they want to follow the conversation if your next message is not shorter and on point im not gonna read it >segwit transactions are not anyonecanspends and despite what people often say they do have digital signatures so its segregated witness but not in any case old nodes need to accept these tx as spendable without seeing segwit so what kind of sig is there and why then even swap out the og sigs >but it is not dependent on miners to continually enforce segwits rules citation needed >if the majority of the hashrate wasnt segwit aware at the time that segwit activated hence the totally unbiased blockstream meeting with the chinese miners >after all thats the whole benefit of proofofwork mining its sybil resistant you say that and yet in the same post you say nonpow nodes matter find the error  >well firstly if you try to spend segwitlocked coins this way ie without providing a valid digital signature then you wont be able to get confirmations you forgot the part about the <number> attack these miners make their own confirmations im waiting for the explanation of this magical sig >you might think the majority of miners could reverse their enforcement and then the funds would suddenly become anyonecanspend but fear not because thats not how it works at all even if a majority of miners change back to presegwit they will just fall out of consensus with all of the full nodes that actually are segwit aware and here it is our nonpow read only nodes protect the network none of these nodes count there is only a single nonmining node that counts and that is the node of the exchange where the attacker is going to sell his coins >miners cannot band together to change the m coin limit and thats because of economically relevant full nodes enforcing that rule yes of course the attack would cause a lot of chaos and people would rally to undo it but nothing of this is enforced in code or prevent the attack vector from existing other coins dont even have this attack vector >they cant thankfully because full nodes reject invalid blocks again full nodes can do shit without pow there is some outside power on the edges to fiat like exchange nodes etc but non of that has anything to do with the network it is social power >this goes to why healthy full node diversity is relevant so ill speak to that arguments based on a wrong assumption dont hold > firstly to clear this up the full nodes arent voting on anything so this isnt subject to a sybil attack its not the oneiponevote problem that satoshi was talking about because full nodes dont vote on what transactions are valid they dont poll the network to see what other nodes think they just drop invalid transactions a node can check if a digital signature is valid all by itself including with segwit transactions if the node is segwit aware it doesnt need to poll the network and decide collectively with them on whether a digital signature is valid or not if a script requires one and there is no valid digital signature it just rejects the transaction unilaterally regardless of what other nodes do it also rejects any block that includes the invalid transaction what you describe is a sybil attack if just a bunch of full nodes decide to reject a tx that does exactly jack shit in a decentralized network if they are so massive in numbers that they surround miners and can block them from receiving a tx then it is a sybil attack and every state can run these for much much cheaper than a <number> attack which means the premise of bitcoin would be flawed congrats on your argumentation >if miners create invalid blocks with invalid coins that arent spendable in the economy theyre not benefiting from that again that is social pressure and does not eliminate the attack vector who know what the landscape looks like in <number> <number> <number> <number> years the attack vector will still be there >agents who run their own full nodes matter but only so long as theyre economically relevant agents receiving bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services you just crippled the chain so everyone can run a node but only a few can transact good luck with that exchange for goods and services bitcoin gets weaker the fewer actually use it thats why small blocks can be considered an attack too >the whitepaper itself talks about this it says <number> attacks do not throw the system open to arbitrary changes such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them no it absolutely does not nonmining nodes are not a thing in the whitepaper or during satoshis time non mining nodes came in later all nodes satoshi is talking about are miningnodes >some people think satoshi always referred to nodes as mining nodes exclusively but satoshi is not talking about businesses running their own mining operations instead of using spv good god stop it already with the spin he could not have talked about nonmining nodes because the concept didnt exist at the time >mining is for double spend protection not for enforcing digital signature checking etc just more spinning >understand that everything in bitcoin could have been done before the pow mining that satoshi invented except for the double spend protection just because miners were added to the mix for double spend protection it doesnt mean all of the rules now become exclusively miner controlled theyre still enforced by all the nodes on the network unilaterally not by miner sayso this is a good thing because we wouldnt want miners to essentially be the collective custodians of our funds anyway but you risk giving this up if you dont have enough node diversity and the best spin reserved for the end beware of the ones that try to dismantle the importance of pow,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYR2IxV2FURXFJRWZiSkJWS1FNdDg5UTYwX0JIVFB5R3V4VWJnSV92TU5mbnRiV0FkM2Z1djh3RnUwckJ4cWZhdWZpMVFFRFMxZ2NUTlRaN3FvWkJKWkRSbFNfd2g1TU94LU5HZTBNOTBicDg9
>also remember that when activating a hardfork upgrade you want practically every node to upgrade as well thats the relevant comparison with a hardfork upgrade you want all of the mining nodes and all of the full nodes to upgrade yes of course that is what you always want the biggest consensus possible why would you do it any other way why would you hide changes from people so you could drag them along without even asking them hf and sf are two sides of the same coin you need both for a healthy efficient chain but you dont need them for ngu you just ossify and live of your big name,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU1hDTjBBdElxSC1fbmpsY1JFZXVTdVUyNW1oSHY0cXVRLXJHTXprTExYWUphOGN2b2tjNjZwSXBJM3B1THQwMTluRFNrNUtHd2hoRFFRd0dNazFJZEFhdEs0RTBzNzdqUUNJTkE1OGRXWFk9

it may be true that kaspa isnt as battletested as some older techs this is a fair point but so far its been performing flawlessly with the exception of a dust attack a few years ago that was patched i think its important to differentiate a technological advancement and a quantum leap digibyte from my preliminary research appears to be a welldesigned blockchain which i would consider a technological advancement you might be familiar with this parallel but in web dev world theres a runtime package manager called node everyone uses it the creator of node then created deno many years later as a replacement he highlighted some very fundamentaly errors node made that are completely legitimate actual pain points that all serious web devs experience at some point deno is significantly better than node yet it has a very low adoption even after a few years this is because its not really a quantum leap its just an advancement i hope it explodes in popularity but i dont think it will a functional blockdag the first in history is a quantum leap in decentralised currency this might be equivalent in the blockchain world as a room temperature superconductor would be for the tech industry it allows for previously unimaginable of speed and scalability without compromising on security with a blockchain when you increase the block conf speed you decrease the security this is what makes kaspa revolutionary and actually what allows it to solve the trilemma because the opposite is true its the dag ghostdag specifically that creates the underlying robustness digibyte is a blockchain and any blockchain can make the claim of being anything but the fact of the matter is that blockchains are simply limited an advancement yes but the height of the advancement is not enough to overcome the momentum of the market and whats currently socially accepted like node vs deno but kaspa is high enough its a revolution in the very foundation of proof of work the first of its kind all it really needs is for people to look into it long enough to realise that it is but i believe this will happen without much effort what it is carries it and it will spread in the general awareness > conceptually a confirmation on a short time frame block chain is not really any different to knowing you broadcast your tx to miners on an honest network with ample block space it looks me like although bch achieved its goals it doesnt have a robust consensus mechanism for fast transactions eg <number>conf for example kaspas quick confirmations adds a significant edge in terms of byzantine fault tolerance over <number>conf yes its probably true that the vast majority of bchs <number>confs are fine per se and it has double spend proofs but it doesnt change the fact that these are significantly less secure than actual block confirmations you might say things like well i dont really need that much security but then you might as well be using proof of stake coins not only that but with kaspa as a dag structure confirmed blocks are quickly marked as honest as other confirmed blocks point to them and they are hardened into the network the fact that its a dag accelerates this process in a way that chains cannot let alone <number>conf this whole process happens within a few seconds shai goes into detail here explaining different kinds of confirmations<url> around <number><number> ish i believe shai is talking about double spend proofs similar to bchs <number>conf also can you explain what happens to bch when the tps exceeds more than <number> on a continual basis especially given that there are no rbf what happens when the network becomes congested what is the lifetime of a tx in the mempool kaspa can support <number> tps currently and will expand to <number> tps after dagknight this also supports rbf for the unlikely event that it becomes congested there is space for m tx in the mempool as well on top of this all happening within the most basic layer of the consensus algorithm no need for anything workarounds needed like double spend proofs on top of <number>conf imo kaspa is the first in the next generation of decentralised currency,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYamJMcWZRV2RJbFJscURuTXB6U3R1Y2FySXdEcW1VOUowMThjUkFlZmZxSmR3dHNTMk1JbVQ1UzZQSTIzcmZFUXhGTU5hRHZfcDY4MUg2bHlPUFJKTHc9PQ==

you cant softfork away you need a hardfork to make your chain incompatible to the one the attacker has captured another reason why they tried to slander hard forks when the captured btc if bch hadnt hard forked bitcoin would have been dead and their capturing complete,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaExDOHY4MFBidHNOb0FNU3IyaGxweFNQeno0dXFQczNjeEVmbm5mdjEzVUJTaGZlRWFtUmlheVA2M0Vib2Q5RW9PdXBMQ3F1b0NvN0pkcUFTLVJka0FOX0FsTVd6LWRteWtHd2FaNWdQUnM9
thats because it is expected not doing anything will give you bigger return i love bchbull because my holdings in usd are increasing constantly and im happy to pick premiums like that but at the moment bch is going up strongly so ill just watch,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcUZjQ2x3dHFBUkF5SlJEOHpwdXh5NU1RSFlUTmZkOExjdnNTbGZyRHl5YWJTdFlXRmtWV3BKS2VGZXhrNld1VDJfSG9GQ3RENGhSNnljcG9yYlRTWkE9PQ==
the only incentive is ngu unfortunately blackrock can keep that gravy train rolling for a while the good news is that it is still bitcoin sucking up all the fiat wealth at some point it will become too fragile and bch will be the inevitable resolution just hope we live to see it,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWnFRN1FyVzl3QnR3R0h5NmV0YTJaeVJsV3JFS01kUVNPNGtTODA3ck5GMWU0NzF4STQ3cEp6YnJ1UGRoTDFHc2xEZ1lKbTE3SmpZcWd2YXVWZm96bFE9PQ==
yes its not just about premiums you also need to get the timing right,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbnl2S1htX2xPTURWWE1nRldkWFhnRFRGMWdSSEM4b2lWX3NHT2dDQXFnWDdDNTlMZXZBSUpRUUtlT1UySnI3bmJZSTdPZ1VDSXlWc3N2V0tTWHFXVmc9PQ==

less time between blocks results in more stale blocks and reorgs btw having faster blocks does not mean faster transactions because you need more confirmations for the equivalent security,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUnJoWVFqX1Zvc3FaNWhab0hIMXAwcEZzNmcxV3FEWE92MGJydDF3WnZwRndraDdjeVk0eVFyMVNaUmY1SF9VVDdQUmltWWJ3NHdZdkszYU5CbnJNd3c9PQ==
short block time increases chances that two miners find block at the same time and one of them will be discarded although min is imo too long ltc proven you can run <number>min blocks just fine,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU2xROWY4X0pzV1dzbHhTd0ZoeUlJcGlMUEtyOUZ1M1ktdTR3dGU2VFozaXZQNkZXODBPa1pCWE0tSVZOdHZETER2UzNmX3dQT180R0l0aFNhVzFqSXc9PQ==
bitcoin unlimiteds nexa has <number> minutes block time definitely a better user experience when you are waiting for the first confirmation on an exchange especially when there has been a drop in hash rate and the difficulty adjustment algorithm hasnt yet well adjusted,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQnllSkpLSU52Vk11a1RuNFFrYXI5TG4wd0VJaDBWeDEtdzNxak5CRVBnOGtYSFlXb3VpbzJrYS1MVWRLQXdUeXFZOUEwUzhROUx4cGJTNVMtc0lxb0E9PQ==

yes more frequent blocks leads to more reorgs and orphaned blocks but it could well be argued that <number> minutes is excessive by an order of magnitude internet speeds and latencies have moved on in the last <number> years i think <number> minute blocks and <number>th the block reward would be a worthwhile hardfork since <number> to <number> global average internet speed went from <number>mbps to mbps x global average internet latency went from about ms to ms x hosting center speed went from mbps to <number>gbps hosting center pings went from ~ms to <ms <number> minute blocks seem reasonable to me people arent running their node miner or spv host on dialup modems anymore,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbkpLR3d6LWZoOHBRR1NwODdrNmFLdUl4UEV0cGs4aG1pWDIxd2JWcDVKSlAydHp0MGxkX1hMVTdPV0tHQ2VQMkhJWnYtY2JzYkxienZlZTRfRXpyVlE9PQ==
bch dev worked on having faster block propagation a lot of optimisation is possible regarding that paramenter,r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLVdkZmx0a24wUklaeHQwYURYNlRRZV9aNGxweWxaNC05Tnc3ZERzbGh4bWhEUGlqZmxrb1VZOUpiUEpaTEt5VmJqVjF5b3FEVXo0aFdWMnI0MEczMXc9PQ==
