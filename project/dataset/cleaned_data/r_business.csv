gotcha so he outsources hr at this point but he still does all his own hiring he has a very specific vision for his company hes still at the smaller stage so he wants to make sure the hires are going to add not take away i dont think he trusts anyone else to do the hiring for him plus he doesnt have that position filled yet he did have his ea go through resumes and then set up the interviews for him but she didnt end up working out unfortunately paul really could be doing this differently but i think he is hesitant to ruin his <number> success rate his company is his legacy its so much more than just a company,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMTVORGFFZVNxcGxDWjlHQm1aRFdmVThENVZrM2NDX2FRQUtYVVE3My1PZ19TTDdCRU01VjE4VExROUxmVnNNeW1ONjViLWExdFc2R2lHMENiRTJ2UkE9PQ==

paul had an ea who did most of the communication for him but she didnt end up working out his company has a <number> success rate with his clients he does not want to tarnish that he hasnt run a single ad for his own company everything is word of mouth which is literally unheard of and insane thats why hes selective with the new hires plus its costly and time consuming to be constantly onoff boarding i keep telling paul all the time he needs balance and to set his priorities straight he wants to get past an obstacle but there will always be more to come so he ends up neglecting a lot over his company he likes to say im doing what others wont now so i can do what others cant later i respect his vision and passion but at the same time im freaking out over this man  he has almost no life outside of work he comes home and just passes out most days or spends his free time resting in bed,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSmZna2tzOUZhLVJJV20wYkVuS1FYS3VfSktabjBXQ0hTOGk2NlladDhPMkp5b0hTZEU0bzBRVWJqOTJxVm54ams4TzZyLVF6WEwwaHhBVzN6NF9EMlE9PQ==

ill probably never work a big corporate job again if i can help it the incentive to do so isnt as strong as it was a few decades ago yes they pay you more than most occupations but it comes at the cost of your mental well being more often than not also big companies used to give people perks and help them out with things they were struggling with like providing child care for new parents or putting you in touch with financial advisors now companies only care about shareholders and short term profits were in an era of greediness and short term thinking that i am confident will have negative consequences later on,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN2JMYTZ0emliRG8yalFONkMxY21weG1DUHJMbTl1bGtvTzdWcXJSbkN0dnFUVWxhbTdqSERCVUVoM2tEOU9rZHhDRUxMYm9qZTF2aW5abUhRTFRZRGc9PQ==
people telling you to take an undergrad business degree instead of engineering are missing the point you are young you should push yourself if you are interested in engineering then do that its a much more door opening degree in general in case you decide to do something else and it will be a lot easier to learn the business stuff on your own vs learning technical skills on your own also you never know where life goes im currently working with a friend who went into the family business but after a decade is looking to get out his college degree was in religion it definitely limits some of his options maths i have a math degree is a very door opening degree other quantitative jobs will take you seriously as i have learned its not about becoming a mathematician same for engineering but its often easier to fit in some business classes on the side in a math degree bc engineering programs often have more requirements,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMnBnUVJId21JNW1PdmMxNWc1LTZRVUJ3eGF3OUhFTXZDQXVidnVYcHpBcV9nandQNXU3NG9BZjJIYzRiU0xxSTF3aFRZQ3lUaEN0eXd2dmh3SWhPU0E9PQ==

yeah i know a few people who have bought businesses bear in mind that youll generally need a lot more than k to do it there are two approaches i would recommend first buy a franchise business or approach a franchise business whose owner is looking to retire and offer to work there as a general manager with the goal of buying their business this is a good training ground for general operation management which youre going to need to be skilled in second find a business whose owner is looking to retire and offer them a vendor finance deal basically you buy their business but pay them off in instalments and if you miss an instalment they get to keep their business plus all the money youve paid them the reason you do this is to remove all the risk for them as most owners would prefer to just get a lump of cash instead this makes your offer more compelling if you do vendor finance you can pay them back from the profits generated by the business itself this is where having the operational management skills comes into play because if you know how to pull a few leavers to increase revenue and cut costs you can improve the profitability of an existing business fairly quickly many existing businesses are poorly run i have a friend who likes buying hairdressing salons for example because most of them are run by people who are good at cutting hair not running a business then he usually raises prices does some proper marketing has a more systemised way for following up customers and reminding them to come back for a cut etc and voila he bought a business for very little upfront cash and within <number> months it is generating substantially higher profits than previously so he can cover the payments to the original owner and still generate a nice profit for himself,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQWFqTDJLb1lwZ2hGSk9xbGJRcGFqVU9LSVpLVEpZUE1mdXFLbWstZDhyQXpCc25RMkZlcGt6aWs2ZlUxZ2RLclNERS12bUZuZG5QakowdW9HVFlBVmVQNzNLSm1lcE11Tlc4Z1hHODMwTVE9

it really would be a stepping stone for establishing a more dependable business for me i know alot about dealing with transportation companies and produce but also food safety stuff ive thought about this stuff before and have experience with what goes on in the back end regarding the things that cause rejections and then having to figure out how to scrape as much money off of aging and unwanted inventory as possible but connections and knowing the demand are just as important as having the money to do it and hard work someone motivated could find themselves a niche and like i said before there will be serious lulls in the availability of cheap rejected product,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRGRjVFB6cFdNVVJRNWROb0JUZUt1RkJObU5ublRGdE1jRl8tYlFuMDNRTHprdEh1UG9sdkhQRHQ2Zmt0M1JvdjkwbXNJR3lGT3RzbTF2WXpKdTZyb3VfVnl1TndiUDk2LVI2TTVEMTNiSWc9

a holding company is essentially a separate company used to hold assets and limit exposure you need the companies to be separate to accomplish these goals you can utilize separate companies to fence off different assets and exposure when my wife opened her medical practice she was required to use a professional corporation i then set up two llcsone for staffing and one for equipment when we bought a building we used another llc for it the equipment llc borrowed money to buy the equipment for the practice which required a personal guarantee which it then leased to the practice the loan and the equipment lease comprised this llcs operationswhich limits the chances that its going to be sued which makes it theoretically a safe place to keep valuable assets the staffing llc contracted with the practice for staffing borrowed money to make the initial payroll and then billed the practice for staffing services this didnt hold assets which made it a less likely target for lawsuits an exercise i recommend when creating several interested companies is to do a venn diagram with lines for contracts and payments between the companies it can get complicated your question brings to mind a series llc which has a parent llc with child llcs created under the parent with only the parent required to pay the filing fees series llcs were created with property holdingmanagement in mind so that a company that held or managed several properties could operate each property as independent companies without having to set up each company they are interesting but the law was still undecided in some jurisdictions whether or not the child llcs provided adequate protection,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZnFjODUxbWNrR1hlQWNRbG5GalNEVDdENFdEdDNZQnpjVG9PQnZSN0loMlRxQTBNNzh4dzd3TnpIRXZtbXB5NzlrVTV0WHN3LVdKb2Q2RGNFbUJiU2c9PQ==

i raised prices at the same time everything was increasing due to short supply at the middle end of covid we had shipping containers sitting in the ocean not able to get here the retail products are made with commodities type raw goods so manufacturers or producers were increasing cost significantly which led me to think it was a good time to follow the pricing strategy that i used in my other business i didnt change anything else but i did lose some key employees and now i pretty much can only afford myself and <number> employee and we offer really great customer service i have customers pull me aside to compliment my employee and me being customer focused my whole life i know i give at minimum above average customer service the segments or brands ive analyzed show the higher end product lines have remained stable or a bit down in sales the main drop is in the middle cost brands so im planning to aggressively market those brands with a return to proper retail pricing i agree i need to get out in front of the customer more but im usually pushing paperwork when im there so i dont get to see customers as much as i should i cant decide if i offer a mea culpa on pricing to my customers to get them back or if it will hurt me further i do have contact info you mentioned so sending email ds is a big part of our marketing campaigns,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb2F1Q1ZBamhfWFZmXzNqaWtDWmFaQ0pPLS1uZ1FsVFV5bUN5b1FWdVlycHNFRURmekYxNkJGMTViQ2VJQVpkR0UyYksyOXIwRFFJTHJGUEV5TjU1dU9zdzFvRnB4MUttTlo4aWtpWEh4YlE9

im not saying an accounting degree is a bad degree its a great degree if you want to become an accountant accountants are very useful in my field there are generally <number> professional pillars law econometricsfinancial mathematics accounting and engineering i wouldnt really call any of those options a generalist degree though there are no generalist degrees anymore the world is run by technical specialists nobody gets an accounting degree and then does engineering work outside of maybe the software industry where historically software developers didnt need degrees but technical skills get you into technical industries which is where the money and power are and theres a lot of onthejob learning where someone with a strong mathematical background can flex their way into other roles to a degree but it generally goes in one direction the more technically specialized the work the harder it is to get in but you can move in the other direction more easily so engineers and lawyers can move into finance but finance people dont generally move into engineering or law without additional degrees though there are highly specialized areas of finance where this might not be as true as it used to be,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU1h1eHd4ZEU5aVlqNkdFQnJ2X3BEZXotZkRkZ3U1eGl5QTlaaUhhbExEM0QtUlA5Y0pSUmVNZ1VjUEdNelhuU2ZENmpRV1NlNjBQeHJ3VDFfTkt6blE9PQ==

it depends upon whether the sale is structured as an asset sale or a stock sale most small business sales are asset sales old owner regardless of the form of entity will sell all of the companys assets to new owner in that case old owner keeps the debts and pays them off with his share of the proceeds a stock sale generally applies to corporations in that case the old shareholder sells his company stock to new shareholder the new shareholder then owns the entire corporation including the companys debts those are very basic illustrations but they should illustrate the concepts,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV2RMejQ2R0EwR2Y5ZklYaWJQVWpXRXBPTk1RWm43b0pMaUVkbkVBNF8taFpCR1BHa2p0ZGl1TFFBZVJHbVVFM2h5S2tldEVGNDVPOXdZWFhpQjlsZ3c9PQ==

hi i understand your situation dealing with social anxiety when starting a business can be challenging one way to handle it is to prepare thoroughly before any business interactions know exactly what you want to say and have clear goals in mind also start small and gradually expose yourself to more social situations related to your business practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing before meetings remember that most people are focused on the business matter at hand and not on judging you it might help to view these interactions as opportunities to learn and grow rather than as stressful events i hope this helps and good luck with your new business venture,r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOVJUVG9IR0dBMFlWZ0wwODd0UFVUdTBCeXZPZ2s2VnVPWDk3dEVEbW9uYnZENlBTVHNLV0dkcUdZaDN6WktnWlJ0SDhSUi1KSklHeE14aWpudjNYWXc9PQ==
