there are several factors that influence the solubility of salts eg dielectric constant temperature and ionic strength of solution probably most relevant for you is that any source of chlorine will decrease the solubility of your salt due to the common ion effect think back to le chatliers principle de ionised water is probably best as for how clear the solution is that largely depends on how much light is scattered through it if your salt isnt precipitating or indirectly causing large colloid formation by aggregating small particles in solution then it should not be an issue all the more reason to use pure deionised water hope this helps,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVklIbE81VGZnWnFKU2QwMWp1eVFEd19uVlJSdnJQYUdGYVFMUkhBVGw5ZE91TlZaLXZ2QUdtMDhtanZaV2w2b3JxNGZsNHo1U2xKcklaS2tMSGkzYkE9PQ==

also any comments on this exchange about the danger of introducing water from chatgpt o >the recommendation to avoid using water on a lithium fire is due to the fact that lithium reacts violently with water producing flammable hydrogen gas and heat which can exacerbate the fire this would be true regardless of the specific lithium compounds present in the battery me regardless i find this suspect >chatgpt o youre right the specific chemistry of lithium compounds in batteries can play a role however the key point is that lithium metal itself reacts with water >while lithium hexafluorophosphate lipf is used as a salt in the electrolyte of lithiumion batteries the guidance to avoid water on lithium fires primarily relates to the behavior of lithium metal when water contacts lithium metal it produces hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide both of which can worsen the fire >additionally in the presence of lithium hexafluorophosphate water can indeed lead to the formation of hydrofluoric acid hf which is hazardous thus while the presence of lithium hexafluorophosphate can make the situation more dangerous the general advice against using water applies even without this specific compound,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZmwzWHV3Vmk2V29hRWJoSW8za3Job2Uzdk92OVItMzhnc0tHbG5CdnBXODNhR243eXpnR3k0Uk1RcG4zMGNBR1FHVlBkbmFGdVpkMFJzTlJnZlFZQkE9PQ==

solubility depends on the substance to dissolve and on what other suff is in solution so also ph for example i would avoid tap water for a multitude of reasons and stick to distilled or deionized water boiling the water off can cause reactions that can introduce impurities if you boil the water off to dryness all of those will stay in the material once you reach a point when there is almost no water left the temperature of the slurry can reach much much higher temperatures and decomposition can occur do not boil to dryness over an open flame or stove it is better to slowly evaporate at only slightly higher temperatures and continuously remove the escaping water either in a vacuum or by ventilation for large amounts this is very slow another option would be to carefully evaporate until crystallization first occurs and then precipitate your product by adding a solvent that is miscible with water but doesnt dissolve the product for example acetone or if youre lucky isopropanol then you filter the slurry through a coffee filter and carefully press off the solvent then leave it out to dry at roomtemperature this introduces flammability risks and can introduce impurities from the solvent if you buy crap so only do that with some knowledge of what youre doing this may provide and additional cleaning effect if done right but at the loss of yield depending on how much water was left,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTVdMUS0zbWc5c2VheDhkWHB3ZVFpcC16SlNhMURvU2FRcS1ad1BUeEVRQUZ4R3BFdEhaMU1PTU9zTW9xLVNTei0ybnUwZ3REY2tmeHZJUzRobTM2SUR2emFfQzFnU0M4ak9oeEhVbVM1OEU9

there are a few things i would say are wrong here <number> transmittance vs absorbance wiley is showing absorbance amount of infrared light utilized by bonds at a given wavelength while you are showing transmittance in your graph amount of light passed through the sample which is the typical way organic chemists look at ftir data your conversion may be incorrect depending upon the settings for the ftir as other forms of measure do exist each with slight augmentations to the output data kubelkamunk transmittance absorbance reflectance <number> wiley is a pretty poor source for ftir data as unless you pay for their services you often receive a single peak often in the fingerprint region at the most intense pointnot the most useful point realistically there should be far more peaks than this singular peak in your compound even in the fingerprint region <number>realistically the only times you see true ir invisible compounds is when you have diatomic elements such as oxygen and nitrogen or perfectly symmetrical organic compounds with nonabsorbing groups acetylene and ethylene <number> of the time organic compounds always have some absorbance to be seen so i would expect to see ch bonds sic sionh and nc bonds <cur> what is your atr prep procedure do you properly clean the atr crystal and press between samples have you visually inspected the surface between samples i suspect based on the lack of ch peaks and general lack of compoundassociated peaks that the background was taken with a sample present subtracting a from all of the expected peaks <number>it appears your ir instrument observed a change to the amount of co present between the background and the actual sample this isnt a big issue for personal use but can be quite a nuisance if you attempt to publish with ftir spectra as the negative peak should not occur there are instrument techniques that can be taken to control this but is not necessary if you are reporting only peak positions and not full spectrum data,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWllicmx5aDdzejNwSUJzYWVSemYtUmNjaUk0RkJ2YlU1TjNtTkdpcndMNTJiZ0MtR2d4aHNkNkRNRjhja0FJQVpVRlktb3B5Ykc5S2NOYngxUmZoeXc9PQ==

no problem ftir is a beast of a technique when you get into the nittygriddy of all the possible controls that can be taken care of with the instrument additionally transmittance isnt just the term utilized for the y axis of the output data transmittance ftir can be taken when you take an ir invisible salt and a portion of your sample and compress it to make windows for the ir to transmit through atr attenuated total reflectance contains additional mirrors compared with transmittance experiments since the beam is technically displaced from the original path up to the back end of the crystal so that it can be reflected towards the detector opus settings can be adjusted between collection units to give you the data you want for each experiment one way you can ensure that the data you are collecting is sound is by doing a stepbystep approach its a little timeconsuming but you can take a background with any preferred setting absorbance transmittance et cetera absorbance being easiest for doing math in excel before conversion and take sample measures several times with that same background take a sample of the air nothing on the crystal to prove a good background is being taken the slide you wish to use to prove that the slide allows for clean atr analysis a known compound with clean ftir peaks methanol or isopropanol are great choices since they are dirt cheap and have nice clean ftir spectra when performed correctly and then finally your sample with absorbance so long as you dont change things between steps you can subtract the values from each other and receive the same effect as blanking with the instrument now you dont have to do this every time you run ftir but this will be strong evidence for if your spectrometer is giving accurate data and that your approach can produce excellent data its better to do this series of experiments once than to guess if your technique is good,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaGNzcE5mb2VyUm9hUWt1RU00NmpJUkh1Qm1oVGVFS0JCemprVmNSMmwzcWR2bTN3bzRCNC1WY3VJWi1ucUY5Z0ZoNXJpRXYwWHBNVVNjRXdVRk1hc2c9PQ==

everyone in my lab wears jeans and tshirts no matter gender i would wear crop tops tanks to school and just change into a tshirt before hand the labcoat covers the rest your school might have a dress code for lab wear like mine does mine does curiously allow skirts dresses as long as they reach the ankle personally i would never wear long sleeves in a lab if you spill something on yourself tight fitting or not youd have to pull it off and the fabric would keep the chemical in contact with your skin longer a lab coat is easy to rip off a shirt is not of course youd have to rinse for at least <number> mins anyway but might as well be able to keep your shirt on also ive gotten stuff on the cuffs of my gloves and it would get onto my labcoat sleeves better the school labcoat than my personal shirt that id wear home and expose other things too chemical hygiene should be your top priority here,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTEl2YzdiSUY2YVNxa3IybXNwcHNLYW4wT0xGaVlidkNSWTNwZ0ZMb3RUM3hLNncyM2piUzBfR0czWUxlOVB2TlN3R1NmcjVXTk5KRmhmTFlSLUZRWFE9PQ==

especially when it impacts safety i work in service labs and some are pretty horrible bad pay lots of time pressure so cuts are made where ever its possible in many places safety just gets ignored to a frightening degree theres one lab with an extraction that requires like ml hexane and some toluene as well since they dont have much time there they dont use the solvent dispensers and instead just use the large chemical bottle lots of splatter many puddles in the fume hood and the workers there often reach into the fume hood with their entire upper body once asked one of them if the smell doesnt make them worry since it was so strong even in front of the fume hood and they just said smell i dont smell anything they also handle toluene like water washing glass ware with it using it without a fume hood and gloves etc in another lab were they handle oleoresin pepper extract one girl got some on their hands and washed it off with methanol from the barrel right on her hands from a barrel with no drain below so it just ended up on the floor fuming away it scares me to be in labs where safety isnt a priority most of these people have no idea what they may be doing to themselves,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSkE4ODRtbW8xdzM2QWtlV3I3aUU2NXdrMUw2ek9sbmhfN0Q1aDVoTmNFOTdadGhqQjExSjlqQjBpd3FoUEhiRlNSUHg3UEJIOVpNZkRFODdJenhfbkE9PQ==

if you want to do chemistry for any decent salary youll need at least a masters ideally a phd its really not a field that i would recommend going into if money is your priority the safest route is to focus on organic synthesis and then look for jobs at pharmaceutical companies and such any wet lab experience can also get you a job in the petroleum industry if you do end up liking physical chemistry which isnt typically analytical you could potentially get a job with companies like intel working on semiconductors or even quantum computers id say this is the high risk high reward path if your goal is money theres fewer jobs in this market but they pay pretty well ive also known people who got their chemistry phd and then pivoted careers to consulting or patent law which can be fairly lucrative,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZS3hnd3B4dGhtaDY1Mi1KSDRnc1BTRTFmbkQwTGJiRDByMTlodExwWUYtUEZ4bXNwcUplRGx5VHVmSzRFTXVpT2R5dmhieXVpSUw4N0NfSGpaaUxlNVE9PQ==

deucravacitinib has a deuteromethyl amide by making that methyl fully deuterated the metabolism shifts to another site on the molecule metabolizing the methyl amide led to a compound that was still active but was also active against other kinases which would lead to offtarget effects the metabolite of the other site of oxidation does not have the same tox issues,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZ1pNSHFxUFhqa1AtSDYtdkhlNHdiV0Q2SGFqcmVsUmhscnBmTDEtU25lZ19XWWNYajZFXzBxM0dYVW0xOS16dmxUc3RlVDkwTWdFWHdZNVhvRjJlTVE9PQ==
just commented to someone else but yes it can matter hugely and the tox difference can be massive deucravacitinib is the first i think drug approved to have deuterium intentionally incorporated the site of deuteration was the metabolic soft spot when not deuterated and that led to a metabolite with offtarget activity by deuterating that site metabolism was shifted elsewhere on the molecule and the toxicity was greatly mitigated,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdy1qeW9iR1ZaYWtNTjd1WVg3LW10Z1hNRzdDOGk5bHJJYW5MeDZLMUtmMGFta21RVndFeS1zejB4eUJRcGo0ZlpMZlp4QmhLNEFvcDRLbTg1eGlxZnc9PQ==

you are not doing this at home considering that boron melts in the same temperature range as most common ceramics maybe higher blowtorches are also probably not as hot as you imagine they are the temperature of the hottest part of the flame being in excess of the melting point is quite different from the flame actually being able to heat a bulk object to said temperature particularly in an open environment if you really want this to work you would likely need to invest in a tube furnace and an extremely high end one at that i am drawing a blank on what material the crucible could be constructed of all the common materials like alumina quartz stainless steel etc would melt before boron maybe graphite or some kind of tungsten alloy once again i advise against this working with temperatures above c is likely far beyond the abilities of anyone who has not undergone years of rigorous training and even then it would be illadvised for them to attempt outside a professional setting where there is likely inadequate safety equipment if any at all,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU0dWcXFEODZIMmN3RUhGR2QyN3NLZ2xPMGJNeENEOG4tVGFXM1R2aFJNTTgxbjlfVzNESWVOZUNOWmx2X1d3WEs3TEFudWhaY09vVkNneVg0SEZDUVE9PQ==

whatever you spray on the rusty joints is not going to last auto parts used to be hardchrome electroplated by a multistep procedure i think first it was copper plated then it was nickel plated and the nickel surface was chrome plated at the end in a thicker layer very involved procedure if you wanted hard scratch resistant shiny chrome plated parts for your car that would last few years and not peel off as you said you get salt aerosols and everything will rust in these conditions so chose some simple anticorrosion primer and finish and apply it more often chrome spray is not a good choice because it will not last or if you want to be fancy replace them with parts made from some coppernickel alloy but it is going to be more expensive,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVkhXVDF6bTJPMzV5NGdfbU9OUUpZdGhTUGhUM0xEbERRLTN5MG5mTlY2WUJuNFEwbXdBQ1NVV0pZLXVUUGhYaHFabm1nWC15WTIxTnNoaTBVandhM2c9PQ==

food safe just means the manufacturer is very certain theres nothing in that thing that you can sue them over plenty of things i would guess the majority of things are safe or relatively safe to be used with food but may contain components that could present problems if you use them every day for ten years or present a problem for a remote percentage of people it could even be as simple as the manufacturer not giving it a proper wash before it leaves the factory this automatically qualifies something as not food safe out of the box,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaODZWOHJjQXpneFVqRzVZMndhVGVTa3NOekE5M3NuQUdEQTlwbDU1U0xBZjMyYjJqaFYzY1VqUEVNUHJyMld5Wm02MWY2dlhnbENFbkFwSWRoWl9mNHdJNFNBVjBmSk8zRWxOSEhnWS1OZDA9

idea is good in practicality say you take a bucket and fill it with water place it next to you and for example take a jug that you would fill up from the larger containerthe bucket and use that jug to pour water on what ever you are holding in your other hand theres a few problems first as the pile of dishes growsit doesnt even have to be that many you find yourself in a situation where you have to keep getting up and refilling that bucket potentially even several times you would be surprised of the amount of water that goes down the drain from a longer dish washing session if you choose the open tap rinsing option i say that because even in a normal household situation there are alternative methods for rinsing dishes second it is quite time consuming rinsing each item by pouring water over it if you step it up and drop being shy you ad to first problem the bucket gets empty fast in a remote scenario imo a more practical solution is to take a container with clean water and simply place the dishes in that container once the water gets soapy replace it or you could even use two containers for an optional rinse post the first,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTkp5ZEdreGJlbzJ2UDNNQWVvcFJWdWxLN0k2T0R1cld6XzhTb1lyWWI0czlZVDhKbmgwclpsTnpNSVNKb1RvZFlMZXVQYV9kMGJ4YVE1V0VjRGdSc2c9PQ==

really highmelting materials can often use a watercooled copper crucible you wind up with the molten material inside a solid crust of itself inside the actively cooled crucible which remains below the melting point of copper it does mean you have to apply the heat directly to the middle of the material usually by something like vacuum arc melting<url> or induction heating see skull crucible<url> a graphite crucible might work but id be worried about the boron reacting the with crucible to form boron carbide tungsten borides are also a thing for that matter,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeDM4X2NYNkVHbWI0YUtoWW9FN2FHWllFRWlRcVM3NVdWcE5zeVVlaUtHTVE0NkUydmJMWFJWV2E0Y3RxMjhncDdWeUZ0RjFPdTRqSTNfdzlVWlVNS2c9PQ==

boron has a very high melting point of c only the very hottest oxygenfed blowtorch would reach that and even with that it is questionable how well can you do indirect heating of dust in a dish since much heat is bound the escape but before getting into that we should consider the fundamental chemistry problem of hot boron reacting with air it does oxidize and its oxide partially evaporates before melting plus it also forms nitride with nitrogen in short you better not try this at home,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQVM4UzYzN3NnYi1adWdnMU83NUh5WlEya212SUNsbWlDZmdVZm5UOGY5QXRWRHBLQmlHb1JQOEphaTQ5NTJFNWVjRzItMS1MU3VHcDJCalRYaWkzTExWLWs4cWluUDViN2dFeDFsZmdKeTg9

you have a lot of biomass in the drain that has absorbed water and swollen chemically bad idea to start mixing chemicals in the drain you have already added a strong caustic chemical in an attempt to dissolve hair and fat ideally for biomass you would have used dilute sulfuric acid it will break down the plant cells walls and any hairfibres you have to be really careful because you dont want it or any fume in your eyes also the drain is now full of strong caustic any acid is going to react and make heat + pressure you can fill your room with corrosive acid vapour its basically going to be a drain snake if you cannot try taking a metal coathanger and untwisting it into a long piece of flexible metal poke that down and try to dislodge the lump you can also try using an ordinary garden hose clamp it onto the faucet and poke the hose down the drain turn the water onto full and try to blast the lumps further down downside this may move the clog into a worse location,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNXlrOVdQOEJyaUNzYVBHMzM1Sk5VLWlqRHJWaEhONzRmOHBxTTJrcGZjNXFTZXNkbXp6WS15QjdrTTBqclJCR0JHTEQ0MTY4aV9obkk4a3dXMC1INFE9PQ==

ah in that case you dont want to use a pure nitrogen atmosphere it will destroy the fruit you want to control the temperature humidity oxygen and carbon dioxide levels<url> fruit changes ripeness because of ethylene gas as it ages it naturally releases that gas which causes other nearby fruit to ripen at the same time best method to preserve fruit is fridge temps and put it slightly under vacuum or just get lots of fresh air pumping through the container to dilute away the ethylene gas a really cheap method to do this at home is with dry ice throw a handful of pellets into your container it will create positive pressure that displaces any ethylene increase the co concentration to stop ethylene production slows down any microbes and kills a few insects plus it wont leave any residue,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNnJIeFRjQ3ZQbTZWNVoxdHEyZUVHLXNzRzZRRUl2bHJvOGVtUm5Ld1BuQ0ZTZlhNMUhTYjZkU0FvR1laX08xaVM0bWRvYXphbjlETXhkcDJMR2VqaVE9PQ==

dude those tanks are nowhere near enough gas to purge a box <number> grams of nitrogen is about <number> gallon in volume the box will need to be at least a half a gallon if not larger in volume to hold enough fruit to justify its existence this is a lot of effort and cost to preserve <number><number> apples i assume you want this to save money by buying in bulk or while on sale to get oxygen down to a low level for say a <number> gallon container you will need several gallons worth of nitrogen gas theres nothing that prevents the incoming nitrogen from displacing nitrogen and leaving behind the oxygen effectively doing nothing but waste nitrogen so you will need a big flush of gas to get all of the oxygen out essentially the problem is more complex than you think a simple addition of a small amount of n isnt going to magically force all the o out its going to take way more than those cartridges can supply if its not completely air tight which is what you seem to be suggesting oxygen will constantly be diffusing back into the container a completely airtight seal or a constant positive pressure would be required to maintain low o as another person pointed out you need to be mindful of ethylene gas sealing fruit in an airtight container might make them ripen and go bad more quickly since they are trapped in there with the ethylene lots fresh fruit packaging has air holes for a reason,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeW9GZjZBcmpYVWp1T1dnOU05XzR6Slo2dEFtUXJvUHBlcExPdlRXR3JWSEtWVGdYQldzWUV5UlF2YkZQX0t1c3BBNXROSnowdkZMYzRCcFlaNk5ObFE9PQ==

hi from a soon to be chemistry graduate i took ap chem in high school and had the exact same excitement about experiments labs and wanting to learn how everything works and exists i started majoring in chem but then suppressed these feelings and switched to majoring in engineering because it would bring in more money i suffered and struggled through for two years hating school and losing my passion for learning after a ton of inner turmoil i decided to follow my instincts and switch back to chem and it was the best decision ive ever made i need to work hard to understand the concepts but i love it beyond belief i tell you all of this so that you dont make the same mistake i did listen to your gut do what will make you happy and what you hope to do long term not what will bring in the most money in the end you are the one who has to spend all that time learning material so you might as well make it material that you enjoy my advice is to just do a ton of practice problems when your teachersprofessors give you them repetition and rewriting notes helps me understand the concepts better also the job prospects for a chemist are enormous everyone needs a chemist most bs jobs fall under analytical chem which leans towards quality control and analysis but phd chemists do research and figure out how things work,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR1RudTJTUlNSM0gtLXJETUdFOW9PVnh5NGZ4aUJQdkNLNU56QmxUX3J0RHptUXZNSFE3c19pWVloMXBteGhDSnZZRUYxRExwNlB4SnV3Ym9EZmxCT1E9PQ==

it depends on where you live and what kind of chemicals you want to buy but with a few exceptions eg sulphuric acid in the eu and certain drug precursors just about everywhere most reagents can be bought by anyone its just that most companies dont want to take responsibility by selling chemicals to random people so some specific substances are nearly impossible to get but apart from that youre putting yourself at extreme risk if you try to do this unless youve got some previous training and a wellequipped lab in this video you can find out where to get chemicals <url><url>,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQ3RHSGNIUC1iU0tDakEzS2RpcGR2MlgwQzZaYmtYYnN1WnRBWXNLNzRQZVFLZlZ5Q05mbmZ2OWFsRGZlbEdwbjItZUZmUm4zWEVWUHN5X0ZTbjI0ZVE9PQ==

so to clarify the situation when the practical course touches the end students are asked to clean up the glassware they used which they should do anyways as it is part of the training a date when the integrity and cleanness of the glassware is checked with assistants is also given at the very beginning of this course as a matter that of facts all other students were there on that date to check out of the lab that wasnt the case of the author of this post his glassware wasnt washed and contaminated with chemicals not droplets of water which represents a potential hazard for the group of students that come in the next round this is not a case of a tutor not liking him or anything like that only of respect towards the rules and others this doesnt end here maybe the author should clarify on what the person responsible for this practical course found when he finally came back to the lab and what his bag was containing or should i,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacHI5NVFobThwOFdhd196TUJUa2k0c2VQRzlSckJRbDV2aEx4VXl4d3l3YTdzQzJfYzN3Z0xtN2k4RWE2RlJTcGhmWDlXU0JIVHoxTW4tNGtqTW1KOVE9PQ==

try putting a snug fitting grommet or even a rubber band around the thermometer just above where you want it to hold a snug fitting cork might work also again just to hold also make sure the inside of the plastic fitting is clean and free of oil maybe soak in ethanol or even soap water might clean it now one more possibility notice there are two plastic on glass seals there the intent is apparently that that plastic should be able to seal against glass but it is hard to anticipate every possibility if the thermometer is the right diameter for that fitting then if it is leaking from one it might be leaking from the other too that would be diagnostic that that plastic just does not make a good enough seal with glass for that vapor in which case we are back to putting something around the thermometer above the fitting,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaXdBTGVpMmQ0NEJxTzhnT0ZzaEZYRnFSY2hvaHV2S3cxMlFpTzRROGJHTVFjZUlnNVE1N2tIZjhBS1E2SkxsbUE2OVZWdUZ4dU5SeUo4elhqaWF5UEE4TnZGUTVvTHRiNjdhNWV2WWpNZGc9

my best friends father owns a paint company i visited his factory recently and was intrigued by it i actually asked him if i can make what they do and he was actually willing to give me the chemicals the amount he gave was not very useful though he gave me ~ml of toluene which they used as a solvent and also so that the paint doesnt become too thick he gave me ml of glycerine which he said helps to make the paint thick and make it retain its moisture i hope that satisfies your questions i have proof too if you want,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVklsOGZCZUQ0MDBMVWpNZ2dKS011S2laLUduMWFQZVdVeE9jRkpINnhWbTQyejNoM1R2RGYzc2p2SWNUWE9rblo5WkVhRHVmWktNMVJQVmp1emVBWEhZT00xSVBRRWpla215UkJLOURpMUU9
<number> agree with the comments to start with python it has a manageable learning curve and a powerful array of libraries to perform all manner of computations analysis and visualisation some people suggest computational chemistry but this will require a lot of investment in understanding the underlying physical chemistry which is heavy on maths also the algorithms have been optimised by computer scientists so you wont be doing a lot of coding for the computationally heavy bits rather than using other peoples software that said it is always useful to be able to write python scripts to interface between bits of software parse output files or help with analysis while the comp chemistry route is useful for understanding the physical properties of molecules and their intermolecular interactions there is also to bioinformatics side of things which cover a vast array of topics which can link in with the biology of disease mechanisms of action pkpd modelling etc either way having both computational abilities as well as chemicalmedicinal knowledge and skill will be very useful if down the road you wish to move to industry,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeXVmZlpsNGxLVGptbk53RVNkNjdZZUY4YVc5VXVlem13S1BiQ2ZvNlZnM0ttTnlScDVDeWpUNHFRTXRDb3VLaGhYZzRXeWJRRHFORVRmS2tjMnpoUlE9PQ==

if what you say is true then you should have every idea of just how not simple what youre attempting to do is do you own any laboratory equipment or ppe that would render such a process even remotely safe or possible gonna be honest making paint is a pretty obscure and industrial process to take such a keen sudden interest in the chemicals involved are certainly not hobby friendly and if you dont know what youre doing you are inviting serious potential harm to yourself others or the environment i inquire again what exactly would this paint be used for surely there is no reason to make paint as an individual without professional training if not for a specific application,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTWFscURwSTlqWnIyVlNoT1VpdUhlbFpjRlMyaVJqTldzTWd3RHdjQzJuYkZlb0wtT1YzY0xMZVUzNEdUcktCeXc2UWs0dTN1RjA4V0hROUxlM3d0clE9PQ==

well you said yourself that your best friends dad is willing to give you the chemicals so i suggest you source the materials and more importantly the training from him i still find the idea of your best friends dad just giving you some toluene and glycerol to mess around with as odd bordering on negligent like alright you have some toluene now you can strip paint or thin it but what paint are you stripping what paint are you thickening i hope you can see how those two things are a very far cry from making paint if youre not a painter or someone who interacts with paint then why would you need a solvent i dunno little of this makes sense to me any questions you have or chemicals you need for this project you should source directly from your best friends dads company and seek advice from him hes the one that makes paint,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadXVlWEtfdDhNZkJvdmxyOXFVSkJIUHhKUHNnZENweGNHZ3RmS1lSc2JTbGMxYlQ2b2NFLUJ2SzBwMjFSQUVWUmQzX3pwQlJ3SmZhdkR6bGFsdmhMblE9PQ==

the rules in my place arent enforced strictly it is very common for people to just use many dangerous things like that daily there isnt a lot of awareness which maybe why he just gave it to me because no one seemingly cares as there are no consequences its not that he only gave me toluene and glycerine just to mess around with he gave me what he could at that moment hell probably give other things later and frankly i dont care even if he doesnt this isnt my career and more importantly not my priority i was just infatuated with it and wanted to do more,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWWU5LWg3cWU1VmdWY2dHOHFDT3NGNHRMY1NwMWpHampQa0dmd3BWN2dZbjdyUTEtMGpsYVc4aTNJVjFydDNWUkphX2ZhTHV4RHdHUmJwQVNianVkNU12UFU5Uy1ZTl94a1VkaFVaelk2dXc9

that makes sense just some advice but high school courses are an absolutely horrible metric for what you will like in college or postcollege work most of the time most of them mimic very little of how the work in the field actually looks or what studying in the field in college requires thats not to say dont go with what you know you like but i strongly encourage students to try new things in college even if they didnt like them in high school i would say about half of the students who decide to major in chemistry because they liked chemistry in hs end up swapping majors many of them because they liked the algorithmic approach that works for solving problems in general chemistry and not the rest of the curriculum on the other hand i get a ton of students taking my general chemistry class who tell me they hate chemistry and are majoring in biology or physics or something similar taking my class for a requirement and they end up realizing they love it,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncWVuRUNDUnc3bEpEMlN2bXVkcm9GMEpuVGlMblZDUldrdW1rckZ5ZDRHQi1TUHYyYllYZjdUcEJjakdMUVZ4WmZFeDFIbzhDN1pBZ3pNMkd6dk40REE9PQ==

eh dont be like this guy figure out what you want to do in life and then tailor your education to that dont just major in a science and assume it will make you good money a chemistry bachelors is a stepping stone degree the degree itself doesnt teach you enough to have skills that companies pay for it does however equip you with the knowledge you need to specialize and gain those skills in graduate school i do not recommend a chem bs only especially if you have big career aspirations the majority of the pessimistic people ive seen on this subreddit never had a plan for after college and just assumed their degree would entitle them to a big salary without actually doing the research to determine if that was true its no secret that chem bs dont command much payoften do repetitive work i knew as much going into my undergrad in <number>,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWGc5dDZQM0NaOXNtSlVXNFREc0YzM1M5WDNaMHh1WFJETkVLcWhfbnN3WmQtcVpYREpVaW5YcUN2b05Gak9teWplUTlqVndvdl9DWFpoV19Kajk3Qmc9PQ==

i see but im not trying to pressurize anything i need sodium acetate for a future experiment so im doing a rough measurement of how much nahco is in some old baking powder i found in my drawer its not in the picture but i filled up a measuring cylinder with water and held it above the tubing in order to collect the co gas the thermometer there is to get the ambient temperature which along with the volume i used to calculate the number of moles of co produced with a bit of stoichiometry i then estimated the percentage by mass of nahco in the baking powder mixture ps its <number> acetic acid thats in the addition funnel,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOXkySXdZOUlabHdMUWl2ek5iaS1FUHRTQ1JfTGVwb2pQb0pyTFVqdWZpMnpxQkJqdE1yM0drblhyaENKaUU4YWQxN1FOOW5ReFZTSFlLMVE5UUtVWVY5TnFMTlNKY2k2TXNNVXBPa3FpR2s9

same way i made some in the lab take the three metal oxides in the right ratio grind press and bake at c iirc for a few hours grind press and repeat until it demonstrates superconduvity usually detected by looking for magnetic levitation ybco is a nearly stoichiometric material and just baking in air usually gets you the right level of just off stoichiometric oxygen to show the effect that said i dont think youre going to be successful youre looking to cost optimise the cheap part of using ybco the material itself the expensive part is the liquid nitrogen to keep it cold enough to superconduct youll need a high temperature feedback controlled furnace suitable for running for hours thats not cheap and not cheap to run youll also need pretty high pressures and a die to form the pellets in a cheap arbour press would probably work but the die is going to cost or you already have a metalworking lathe to make it on finally superconducting wires are very difficult to make with a brittle ceramic the usually way to make a wire that doesnt just destroy itself due to thermal shock is to not actually make a superconducting wire instead a high density of superconducting powder is embedded into a metal of good conductivity silver is usual here such that theres a superconducting pathway for nearly all of the distance to be covered making a simple disc at home if you have access to an electric furnace or even a pottery kiln is possible but i think youre aiming for something that is useful youll need tight process control to get consistent results and thats not cheap nor easy,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneGxiSk1jSEdZSlVwY0k1WDB2SlFrSWN4THc1d2tvWlJpRWlES3ptMHBZWHJOTldlWDlGYlBGcHZHRUF0LVR3bEJEenFENi1oeExSWDFtaHI3ZnJuZmc9PQ==
