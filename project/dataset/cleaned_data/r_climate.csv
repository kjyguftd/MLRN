i threw it into chatgpt seems like its all accurate  deregulation and investment accurate deregulation was indeed marketed as a means to encourage investment in needed areas however the effectiveness of deregulation has been debated with varying outcomes in different regions difference between power mw and energy mwh accurate power measured in megawatts mw and energy measured in megawatthours mwh are different concepts power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed while energy is the total amount of power used over time this distinction is crucial in energy management and trading frequency and droop accurate frequency is a measure of the stability of the power grid and is typically maintained around <number> hz in the us droop refers to the change in generator output frequency in response to changes in load and it is indeed challenging to monetize directly sales pitch and maintenance costs accurate the argument for selling off generation assets often included high maintenance costs for old generators with the expectation that private investment would lead to more efficient operations however this has not always resulted in the anticipated improvements education on power generation accurate business and law schools often do not cover the technical complexities of threephase power generation and distribution this can lead to gaps in understanding when it comes to managing or regulating the power sector stepup transformer wait times accurate there are significant lead times for critical components like stepup transformers which can indeed take <number><number> months to replace impacting grid reliability breaker settings accurate breaker settings can vary between the generation site and the transmissiondistribution grid the specific trip settings eg <number> hz or <number> hz are critical for maintaining grid stability and preventing widespread outages regional comparisons accurate comparing fully regulated states with deregulated ones can provide insights into the effectiveness of different regulatory models texas for instance has faced significant challenges including the wellpublicized power outages in <number> highlighting some of the limitations of its marketbased approach,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUTVhbnFzblMwRHJZOGVtSXBlY2xSYTNRdDFmMVZLcW1vZ3pnUHM4cXlxNXlXNElRRXdoQjVxNk40a1NfcXBaSWRSUWpPLUYzd2NsMHJhMlhmWVZJa1E9PQ==

the damage has already been done and there is only one logical move at this point biden absolutely must step down if biden were to stay in trump would have tons of ammo listing all the democratic politicians celebrities voters and donors that dont think biden is fit to serve no campaign has ever ran the oldest candidate in history with very evident signs of cognitive decline being the daily topic of the national media for weeks on end no campaign has ever has dozens of their own politicians call for the candidate to step down or had this level of well known superstar supporters of the party call for their own candidate to step down or had their donors say they will withhold funding until the current candidate steps down or had the majority of the voters of their own party want the candidate to step down trump could stay things like they all wanted him to drop out folks they dont think he can do the job in the days right before the election ousting biden for someone that can passionately and clearly deliver a compelling message would be a huge win for the democrats a democrat candidate that can passionately and clearly deliver a compelling message and does not raise any questions about their health can take his place the democrats can say that they did what they needed to do to pressure out an unfit candidate in cognitive decline and this is where the counterpunch hits full force trump would be about the exact same age biden was when he became president and is showing his own moments of cognitive decline which could be put under a microscope the same danger of a president being overcome with cognitive decline and refusing to step down is even greater with trump trump tried to rig an election tried to stage a coup and the supreme court just gave him dictator level powers if he were to be president again the standards for each party have hit the dirt and are sinking into the ground at this point whichever side actually decides to raise their standards has the best chances in this election as jon stewart pointed out theres still plenty of time for the democratic party to have multiple candidates present their vision and choose the strongest one<url> any attempts by the republicans to try to obstruct the democratic process or prevent funds going to the new democratic candidate would only further expose them for what they are and bolster support donations for the new democratic candidate my vote is for the democratic party to raise the bar edit grammar,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTnhKWVc1UEc5b3dycl8wRG9rOGxIQnpRNVVyczFXR2gtU2dQWWNVcWczZEdhTE02aTRmV1B0dnNNWWdvNHZRWlVzZTlXc3RFOHAtUVhUSEhnWU1uSUE9PQ==

i personally havent noticed a decline in butterflies this year fortunately and its something that my family and i take note of every year allow me to explain if you will a little over <number> years ago we planted <number> butterfly bushes in the middle of our yard to both attract and help pollinators whether they be butterflies bees or even hummingbirds i dont know the scientific name of the things we planted my dad did know and was very proud of them but he passed away in <number> these butterfly bushes have many little white flowers per branch at the end of each branch they have a nice fragrant smell and dont require much upkeep at all im just outside of philly but about <number> yards from where i live is the edge of a large forested area that we colloquially call the woods there are plenty of flora and fauna in these woods such as deer weve occasionally had turkeys show up in our front yard and theres a stream in the middle of the woods that even once had a beaver in it damn sorry i couldnt resist the dad joke so far this year ive seen both yellow most common monarchs orange monarchs and more small white butterflies than i can count if one really wants to both see more butterflies and help them at the same time i highly recommend trying to lure them in do a quick google search of butterfly bush and you should see what im talking about the hardiest version has white flowers but there is a version with purple flowers that is gorgeous but they are more difficult to keep going on a year to year basis the purple flower ones dont like how cold it gets around here thats my hypothesis at least,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcXNKbUV6TndBZ3hUUFkxRUtIWEE3QzhBZG1FaTZTRnpQejBhenMyQU5rcUdIaWc1MlNQZHF6N2F1WUlTaGJYeEdMNUNfeUpsdGhLbkhYbHNzQV9iRWc9PQ==

i did read the article but there is more to a rotorcraft performance than just its lift rotorcraft are very much dependent on their power source to provide power to turn the main rotors as well as to turn the antitorque tail rotor the hotter temps reduce the ability of the turbine engine to produce power which in turn limits its ability to produce additional lift that is already being robbed by the hot temps the benefits of the evtol is that all the power is being provided to lifting the aircraft vertically youre not losing any power to an antitorque system and with multiple rotor disks youve effectively increased the lifting surface area thats why when you look at any heavy lift system it will have either more blades to lift such as the chs or the chs that take all the power and just convert it to lift with the right configuration helicopters can have very high service ceilings i dont know what your idea of low ceiling is but the h has a service ceiling of <number> eurocopters are a lot of the helos that would respond to that region,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWDdyUkR3a3hXMEdVaDNVRXdJZ0tIQlhUbllNNkVFV19MSXNCYTRwcThxN2VOaURvbmpPb20yU0JpYXR5dndVSXFudThUdTRzZFNYNTQtS3dUVS1YUWc9PQ==

actually the warming up of the oceans at this rate doesnt point to many made global warming on the contrary it points to a different source of heating such as higher levels of low frequency radiation that the earth is receiving which would coincide with what we have seen from the sun in the last few years if you dont understand what im saying try this experiment put water in a large pot with water temperature equal to ocean temperature out a lid on it then heat just the air to current global air temps you will find that the water will take forever to change temperature its if fact hardly noticable now bombard that pot of water with a few microwaves and notice the rapid temperature changes heat from above does little to water temperature radiation does a lot if this is the case the our current climate change analysis is wrong and we might be wise to reconsider what we think rapid ocean temperature change doesnt really support the man made climate change theory it does the opposite,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTVRaVmtYaW9jblVucEo4N25DVlFONHRBYm15MzU4OUxrbWpiSXZpSC1Cb2FoLWFQWnR6WTJvLUpxYkg5RW02MUVTazVBVWtZWnVLUC1qZlVITFFfWFhnY3NxdW52U2ZNM0s0YXpQNGtyRzQ9

lol get out of here with this bs nuclear fission hydro solar and wind are all we need solving our reliance on fossil fuels is not a technological problem it is a political problem we could have eliminated fossil fuels at least <number> years ago and could have done it at least <number> years ago had we been forward thinking enough the only thing keeping us reliant on fossil fuels is the lack of political will to crack down on fossil fuels and make the change start voting for people who take a hard stance against fossil fuels and are willing to push legislation that will make the changes needed it is the lack of confidence in maintaining voters that really prevent a lot of necessary changes from happening so the more that get our and start voting for those willing to take a stance against fossil fuels the more politicians will be willing to do what is necessary unfortunately no politician is going to ruin their career pushing for something that has a risk of alienating voters so it is up to us to make it clear that the majority supports the elimination of fossil fuels we do that by voting,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRTBCbEp3bFYwM1FXdG5lMEgxWnMwRVR4Znl4Qmw0MmxFcnZ5LWYyN21QY3RFdUszYTgycGJ1MjRaSTJwMWkwQ1FBMWlzeTlpR3FxT0Jkam9jWkdZNmxCLWo2S1E3RjViRHBPdUtxWEttUmc9

for sure those are reasonable points and trump plays an equal amount of political games with climate change i think the difference is the direct attack and signaling out of tesla by biden thus making it personal for musk and clearly musk has been a much larger critic of bidens general other policies border security dei etc i suppose you could also say that bidens overall degenerating mental and physical state in recent years could easily have been the thing that pushed musk to trump recently but again this is all conjecture there are plenty of reasons both on a personal or policy level that would explain musks move away from biden to trump none of those indicate musks is any less interested in climate change then he was <number><number> yrs ago theres definitely the thought that musk is using this all as a method of appealing to right wing folk who are less likely to buy evs as they view them as a left wing thing anyway regardless of intension musk moving toward trump probably is an ill use the work likely again overall very large positive to ev adoption which is kinda the only thing that anyone on this sub should care about seeing as this is a climate sub and not a politics sub,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYnMtNmwwNi1iYXRiakFzNkgxekFUd2JMSmVmZUV4QmRlam1oZ3Z3eEU0d1lPN3FrMDhGVEVkdnJUTTlocEVEMG40OVlOU1dsczl3RVdRSVlaY3hGcDRTaGtyRGwtYnRqdnJKb1JNUDUybEU9

the whole world though obviously different countries have different needs and resources its also a complex picture because there is a lot of trade eg a lot of the soy that is feeding chinese european and american pigs comes from the amazon in brazil but in general the countries that are doing most animal agriculture have a pretty straightforward way to phase it down without risking mass starvation like i say we already have way more crop production than is needed to feed humans some policy is needed to phase out subsidies for animal agriculture switch then to plant ag to increase affordability and institute policies to help farmers into new activities etc but as demand dries up supply will change as a matter of course,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcXYyTEZfbFB2aTN0UzNvNjViYkxyYW9WQXB1NVFfNFZCcUhLcW1kUTc4MEhqT3pJSUIwWk5ISDI2ZGFkRERQMG5WbWJtd2NyVTY3SU9fWW5RcFFKaXc9PQ==

it doesnt have to reward the righteous and good it only has to properly allow for the interests of everyone to be taken into account when making a decision for example a car plant that is owned by capitalists is very likely to move manufacturing to another country with lower costs for labor and weaker environmental protections because that makes them more profit a car plant run by its workers is unlikely to do that a factory run for capitalists with the sole demand to make profits is quite likely to make weapons that kill kids in foreign countries a factory run by workers with secure jobs and families of their own is less likely to do this i use this example because its a real world example of how democratic worker decision making works in practice <url> > the workers argued that state support would be better used developing socially useful products and production than supplying military contracts sociopathy is inherent to the logic of capitalism other systems can avoid that,r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTHBFQTVWNGlnbWQzdF9iSzRIdG9yZ0lBNkhxLU1yVk5PQ2JRWXpoQXFRNWxTZVlUelJBS2M2Z0NObWxqV3hLTzlmUi1PaVNGdTJwVmk3YVc2aDZUVVE9PQ==
