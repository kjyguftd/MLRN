you havent had very good answers to this so i will try and give you a better explanation the surveillance itself isnt the unjust part it is what can be done with it in the wrong hands you might argue but its not in the wrong hands however its overwhelmingly likely that one day it will be china is accused of unfair treatment of muslims specifically uyghurs lets imagine some part of the chinese government wants to imprison or restrict uyghurs with mass surveillance this can be done in minutes uyghurs like jews will have facial characteristics so you have your facial recognition select for these characteristics and then refuse admission to transport to anyone matching this would get it wrong many times but the people implementing would not care if you look like a uyghur to a bigot thats enough my family parted from judaism many generations ago but the nazis would have killed us anyway sometimes the ethics of a situation is not about the reality of the situation in the present but the possible perversions of that situation as time goes by this is the case for surveillance if your masters are good then surveillance is fine but they will not stay good forever so surveillance is incredibly dangerous,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHQmhxaU9FNXRYVkx1aTBaYVIxZl9jR1pxSXBsQ0hjM1RncWF2SUJRNGdfQTVRNXR1R3J6UWVKTnRITUxxVTU2WFV1NWhTaWRPcWlpRHNpTWhMdkhWTmc9PQ==

another huge benefit of nuclear power is that it can provide grid stability and inertia renewable energy sources like solar and wind really struggle with instability and frequency regulation so if we want to reduce our dependence on energy sources like coal and fossil fuels were going to need to replace them with another source of power thats stable and can regulate grid frequency nuclear energy is perfect for this,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPYm9WOXBrV2IycFBYZEduM19FdUxmTFVVUURMd3ZUOVhfa1pMNFpiWnAwLXNQOVZFR3llYm9yZkh1Yy11WElYZlZNWDVxU2hSNzh2aFUyXzg4c1F5Qmc9PQ==

renewables still have issues it seems to me that banking our energy grid on just a different kind of completely nonrenewable resource lithium or whatever other battery tech gets invented is a bad idea but without batteries renewables have no backup nuclears expensive sure but theres nothing inherent which makes it expensive is my point if we flash back <number> years your same argument would be used against wind and especially solar and in favor of lng so here we are finally your argument regarding cost is contradictory you say that magically it bucks the trend and increases in cost as adoption increases so clearly this trend will continue but literally right after you and your source reveals the reason to be lobbying for more regulations more burdensome manufacturing requirements more nimbyism it follows that a governmental policy of deregulation and streamlining to allow new plants to come online quickly and efficiently would reverse this trend and allow nuclear power to follow the same cost reduction curve of all other technology look im not anti renewable but it seems obvious that in terms of scaling investment in nuclear will be able to meet current and future energy needs more easily simply because the energy density of the materials is greater,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPT2ZCVlJnaG9pY0VNY3RVcTBmX29kRHI5V1lmNnlxeFBMQWxHeG9HcWQ1bGVqRkVMajlrRGg1V2thaGNNOTFBR3haTjFLMWhUSWxKLVJzQjJkaHV0S3c9PQ==

<number> im not saying renewables dont scale but at some point you run out of area that you can pave over with solar panels nuclear scales in the sense that theres only so much solar energy per square ft you can find and so much wind speed as well in an area so if we continue to consume more power and in more concentrated areas nuclear does scale better <number> regularly regularly what the hell the last meltdown <number> years ago happened because the goddamn plant was hit by a tsunami that is in bad faith and in poor form <number> breeder reactors can indefinitely produce fissile materials so no <number> name one gridlevel hydrogen storage plant in existence which does not serve some middleofnowhere arctic village i dont really understand why youre doing an all or nothing stance with this nuclear is safe and a good supplementing power source to other renewables thats not a bold take,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPeEtLeTRQOEFCZUE4ZWxQZ3gtU19lVzVrbFotOVhSRXZJNWJIa3pyREVNZVh0WkpNOHYxa21JaFNxZVlNdmhDQmxsQkZkRFVsNHRPSjhwTDE1NVFqX2c9PQ==
you can power the entire world with solar by covering a tiny fraction of the surface so no you will not run out of space yes we have a meltdown every decade or so if we scale that up this will be more frequent thats regularly fukushima was built in an area known to have tsunamis and was designed to withstand them its failure isnt unique or special its no different than building a reactor in a hurricane or tornado region its not arguing in bad faith its a recent pertinent example heres a list of grid scale ammonia production <url> we can and have scaled this up a <number> mw electrolyzer run all <number><number> of the year can provide <number> mw to top up those weeks in the winter where the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine breeder reactors are a good point but you missed my point which is that you cant talk about lithium not being renewable when its not consumed concrete is also not renewable but its not a problem as its not consumed when running the reactor im not against nuclear but it wont save us its too expensive and too slow to build and not do safe that we can afford to get lax about the regulations which i will point out this bill didnt do,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPSWZ5S0pEM2RoNXdwWmhUeTVyMGM5d3l4U1RTMGg5TVY1SWtpWkQwR0tBal92QnJPWE9yWEJrb3ZMUk1IMnBvdEszU1RNck1jdTh0dk9tNFdYeEJyaXc9PQ==

you miss the problem of solar which is that while we certainly could blanket a bit of the sahara and generate tons of energy the problem is and always has been transport energy plants need to be close to their users and plenty of user live in shady climates where is the unending fields of natural space in the metropolitan north east or the greater london area or in tokyo that solar needs space is still a problem or if not space transportation have you actually read what happened with fukushima the whole problem was that a key part of plant infrastructure emergency energy storage was in fact not tsunamiproof it was a design flaw exacerbated by the fact that again it needed to survive tsunamis i would likewise say that most plants should not be built in tornado or hurricane alleys which is the vast majority of the planet for that problem i say its bad faith because the vast majority of nuclear plants are not built in natural disaster magnet areas and so are not remotely in the same risk class as fukushima ammonia storage is interesting ive never heard of that one and apparently its already deployed at scale very cool while lithium can be recycled and reclaimed from batteries thats not really different from fissiles my point is that one battery facility requires a tremendous amount of lithium whereas a nuclear plant requires a relatively small amount of fissile material in fact is breeder reactors are used you eliminate the need for rare earth mining altogether finally this bill solves the problem i was initially talking about namely that approval is incredibly slow and costly and bureaucratic the example given in the article plant vogtle is a good example if two reactors went through all of the review and safety designs why cant a dozen more identical copies be built off of those same approvals instead each new reactor is treated as a totally new thing requiring a fresh review process its both slow and avoidable and impacts safety not at all,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPRkdZelZMOHNSTG5XMnZ2emFJN1FoRnBTM3hYbEFSZ1hVZXZwLUxicHZ1dllwcmFPTDNCWVBrdHZOZDdMZjcwRTFSYnJ4V3hMdGZOaDNsY2pnMVl1OVE9PQ==

but that is not what the union of concerned scientists says when they mention that a third of existing nuclear plants are not profitable andor scheduled to close the issue us not technology or optics or politics or safety the issue is budget and so if you say costs will drop significantly like they did in france in the ss is our best example really <number> years ago then what evidence can you give to convince opponents that is true the ucs said it would take almost a billion a year to keep existing plants from closing i assume this legislation will allow them to operate longer on a lesssafe margin maybe not even build new plants at some point we are propping up an industry with taxes which is fine if it saves the planet but we cant pretend it is the only possibility so we have to see some cost comparisons and make an informed decision <url> if nuclear can get down to be comparable to solar at <cur><number> a watt still more expensive than gas and wind but less emissions then you couldnt say it is not a good investment if it stays close to recent georgia prices then maybe not the mw vogtle <number> and <number> project both using the westinghouseap design westinghouse went bankrupt in <number> supposedly due to cost overruns at these reactors if we got <number> reactors for <number> billions we are getting mw for b each so at current cost that is <cur><number> a watt comparing solar at <cur><number> a watt to <cur><number> a watt im sure you think it is reasonable to want to see some cost numbers before springing to spend tax money on it right this vox article actually has some numbers to discuss <url> it does seem like other countries have got nuclear down to that <cur><number> a watt so it is technically possible it just seems like a stretch between <number> and <number> full of risks you know <url>,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQX1d6bG9PU3pmay1Kbk0zRUNPMEgxVkU5b1ZfY0RDVlYzQU5oT0FiSWJkN1l2UDFZOG1DY09TZEpUb2MxWmYxQ2FhaDVzS2RFVWpYMmpzVHlCSm50RXc9PQ==

>the bill slashes the fees the nuclear regulatory commission charges developers speeds up the process for licensing new reactors and hiring key staff and directs the agency to work with foreign regulators to open doors for us exports having just skimmed the bill im not seeing that it does those things its mostly just calling for studies reports and recommendations,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXYTZHUTZvRkNlZTFqM2xSR2RESE1fbWhBNk1IbV82Qnp4Q211cUdyNnB2MG54ZHRvV2c3OE9faVhmaTVyUnI5Z09NMWVhejU2TF9NUDNaakpSV3BJRXc9PQ==
re surpassing nuclear is not the same as re be sufficient to replace fossil fuels at present re is only just offsetting the amount of new energy demand in absolute terms since unsurprisingly energy demand hasnt yet plateaued,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXMk9mU1o2Ynd3UWtyaGFjQ2RpOW5WNWlOUlVCb3VNNE5vckYyOVFRUHBQVHJ0ZzFYLVUzRlk5TEVMeEFSZlBmbzRLZEQtLXMyR1ZGSVpsSHNxbkpBSHc9PQ==
>re surpassing nuclear is not the same as re be sufficient to replace fossil fuels youll noticed i referenced both nuclear and coal renewables which only hit the grid in meaningful numbers about a decade ago will overtake coal next year nuclear energy and its <number> years of innovations never got close to doing that >at present re is only just offsetting the amount of new energy demand in absolute terms not true clean electricity additions led by solar and wind are already forecast to outpace demand growth in the coming decade securing moderate reductions in fossil fuel use and hence emissions even as demand accelerates to meet the growing needs of electrification and other technologies embers global electricity review <number><url>,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYnVjQno5Q1dreTV0OFVBSzFTdFl2Zy00dExlOUw3NFd5UTl1V09ZdjJEMTBDc2ZoYlZ1TU5BeHFHLVA3Y1JBRzd5UEp1MEI4UG5KRmI0V081dGFTQkE9PQ==

the fact that these sorts of groups are cropping up is a grim sign that reform is simply not going to cut it at this point people need to realize that industrial society and wild nature are at odds with each other the technoindustrial system will keep expanding and subjugate all thats in its path,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRlRQQlAzZFdSZk5aT0lfT2JUTGdXazlFeHg0enQ4NTNtWkxsVy1FQ1p2OURWSngxT1dqalJBRHlUQVFRMzBNMzRvNndEVzNvTUlLX3VpZ3BCeEhCRGFlQ0F4eFlocXp4eEx4LUg5T2FIOFE9
i honestly have little hope for many of the environmentalist groups that exist today because many of them simply reinforce the values of the system which depends on technological progress proposing and supporting things like green energy will not get us any closer to actually solving the ecological destruction our planet is facing at the hands of industrialism and technological progress i think a group that actually wants to put an end to our technological system will have the best success in ending mass exploitation of the natural world,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT0hwWUY4Z2N6RDhobXhaZVV5NmFxZHNpN1R3bVJSbzM4bnRTU3FpODVSVktZSXZPWWZ4bDd1NVFDMW9ST3k4ZTdTMVVMV2NSdG8tNFhQSk0zUC1HaXc9PQ==

yes these useless gadgets and services are all just the circus part of the bread and circus the technoindustrial system needs people sufficiently docile as to not express their innate desires to exert their will towards working for the lifeanddeath circumstances of their lives were no better than dogs at this point and it can still get worse what kind of social phenomena pop out for you as being an outgrowth of the unfettered progress,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTV9mZ2cwWWRnN1hfbUtLc296X3c2T2oxOGRZSnByd1ZxNmFsWXlOR1VTWHlnN01uOGZUVUd2OEZZY1RJWEdlWDNuTWllTWFETm9nbExyR3ZZNmFtSzFqSHUtWk5Xem9MQS1JRzVZQXgzWEk9

you saw the graph yes with all due respect coal fired plants are being shut down which is why wind has caught up not because its so superior which is the implied byline of the title thought exercise for those of you who still think if a <number> acre field that once hosted vegetable crops is plowed over and paved will a well prepared planted and maintained <number> sq foot home garden produce more food than the former crop field,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWktEZWpPdXE3Rk9Eem5GVzZ5Y3ZscXVZQ0dxaUp5REMwLU1hdFlmNV9sSGM5c2NlbUFsc0g1TE56ZlNoUzJXR2VINHIyeGlGeUpzSDhPbEJvOFNwd3c9PQ==

with all due respect the ratio of coal plants to wind farms has always been unequal wind caught up also because of increase in infrastructure not that it was inherently worse it just didnt have the widespread infrastructure and billions in subsidies like coal in the past,r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaenlNVTg4RjhpWjdhTmFFeEFMendkSERmaWc4T0dJT216ZGZzanVhVVV1MDM1NnFjWkJxd0I4dEtxS19hRkxsVWFrakxPNV92VjQxODFDVVlJbGNCdW5XVjlLWmpycUZjWFlET2NuWTZ0U0U9
