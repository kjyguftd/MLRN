in my opinion collapse is already happening in many countries in the shortterm society will experience a painful and slow collapse with taxes going up public spending decreasing people working harder for less and decreasing quality of life for most people these trends will only continue as the growing burden of the ageing population higher percentage of older people and fertility crisis less people being born increases climate change will also continue to make matters worse with rising sea levels making more land uninhabitable and more frequent natural disasters making our food supplies less reliable in the longterm society could face a complete and catastrophic collapse the only reason we can sustain such a large population is due to the creation and use of artificial fertilisers fossil fuels or very high energy intensive processes are needed to create artificial fertilisers at scale when our supplies of fossil fuels start to run out so does the high yield crops the world has become accustomed to the countries which rely very heavily on imports of food will face having their supplies cut when there is no longer a feasible way to deliver food over long distances at scale the threat of world war is already high but will be even more likely as humanity starts to run out of food water and other essential resources the ageing population will mean that nations are less likely to be able to take part in traditional warfare as they will not be able to spare any young people as troops they are more likely to turn to weapons of mass destruction to get their way in desperate times,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeTIxVEhvZ3otTWJ2UFN3bWh1ajN3UVh2VE1RY05TN1ltQmR3RUhIV2Z5R3BRc2Izb2tMWG8yakJMWVNHWVcxOEF6Q05DV0J2N2hmRzNiZ3g5UVNCWGc9PQ==

allow me to preface i have never and will never vote for trump the news of the assassination attempt spooked me in my opinion based off evidence around his conviction or the amount of things hes been accused of the money they spent in pis to dig up anything they could on him fbi being told to arm with lethal rounds for the mara lago raid the democrats really dont want the people to have the option to vote for this guy i joked recently that if they cant get him jailed theyll have him killed i get that this sits behind conspiracy but our country has done things like this before i think its indicative of being desperate to retain control i worry that we are on the cusp of outbreaks of regional violence and the trump fanaticism scares me i cant say with certainty that if trump died today that there wouldnt be rednecks with guns storming the streets i also cant say that if trump wins the left wouldnt riot and start burning down cities again its baffling weve allowed politics to define our character like this and i think its leading us to a really volatile situation nationally at a point where globally so much stuff is happeningabout to happen that we desperately need to get our shit together and unify under a flag and brace for that storm its bleak but i promise ive tried to stay as objective as possible to arrive at this point as someone who dislikes both sides rather equally,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSEVpY0tSdlF2ejlSczZnS2EtMGE3MFBhV1NqRXNmY0R3WjVEbllFS1gtZDdjdjBFYXhHNGtNdTIxWDJzZ1ZyNmdaYXBOLWFtWGJNWWlfVnBPMnFRSnlzd09FVkdTTWo4VG1fVmJNUWtxWXc9

theres an argument to be made that the current levels of ghgs are already analogous to warmhouse to hothouse transitions for those who dont know were currently in a warm interglacial period within a geological icehouse period these icehousecoolhouse periods have a habit of ending very abruptly due to forcing the petm is theorized to have been forced by volcanic activity for example the current rate of warming is up to ten times faster than the onset of the petm which was considered a very abrupt rate of climatic change academics such as hj schellnhuber have already conceded that weve pretty much ended the glacial cycle entirely its just a matter of lagging right now and waiting for the climate to fully terminate the current ice age nisbet manning et al recently demonstrated that this ice age termination has already been occurring for over a decade based on atmospheric methane volumes which continue to increase without explanation this is perhaps one of the best arguments against other theorem such as regional cooling proxy analogs based on present ghgs suggest its simply not physically possible to observe any sustainable cooling responses as things stand were at that point where any further major change in climatic systems will be the final push necessary to propel us into a thermal maximum state,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVDN0UVBqdnBtT2pKakFEQjNUdTFpRnhYRWd1UkxYYXZ1cy1ibXo5OXpwSUJ4VjRYM09SV3V6SmxLV0RMTVM2aXh6dXRRLXhfcHhheDRnQ28tdktVNzBqa2dwVWV2bWVCbTJHd1BrUUFGSWs9

buddhism has always anticipated collapse collapse both of buddhism did you know buddhism is the only religion to predict its own demise than collapse of the world itself the first is the collapse of buddhism which is tied to the collapse of the current human civilisation the collapse of buddhism was already prophesied the moment the first monk chose to break the vinaya code and the buddha decided to ordain nuns these two things set buddhism onto its trajectory of rapid decline the buddha out of compassion and at a plea ordained the first women to become nuns so that they can too enter the path into arhathood this however is a move that the buddha was reluctant to do initially as doing so shorten the age of dispensation the buddha can do nothing about this this is kind of an inbake law however by doing this the buddha set in motion alongside already the first monk who broke the vinaya into buddhisms inevitable decline <url> now in some ways it did not really matter if the buddha ordained nuns or not as buddhism would inevitably decline anyway but it was accelerated by <number> years of decline as a result nothing the buddha can do about it the buddha still has to follow the rules of nature this set in motion a second problem the very moment an age of dispensation arises ie if buddhism successfully restarts to become a religion that can outlast more than two or three generations the fate of civilisations itself and the world axis becomes tied to the now rerotating wheel of dharma the wheel of law the moment the buddha set the wheel of law in motion when he gave the dhammacakapvatana sutta out of compassion for all beings with little dust in their eyes <url> this tied the entire worlds protection to this wheel prior to the rerotation of the wheel the world was operating more by its own function once again like the nun ordination the buddha was initially hesitant to teach both because it is difficult but also moving the wheel of law beyond himself in a strong way ties the world to the wheel times with non sustaining dispensation were collapse free in a sense as the world has never been under the protection of the wheel in a reliable and stable manner however he only taught and really moved the wheel of law due to compassion not only of the current people but for later generations after he saw everyone who could benefit from the teaching he had to weigh out the benefits and drawbacks once the wheel wobbles and fails entirely the entire world which has for thousands of years been tied to the wheel of law directly or indirectly has to revert back to its normal state this inevitably causes a so called decline in the world and collapse both of the ecosystem and the human world the buddhist prophecies are very very clear that starting from the th to th age the buddhist prophecy describes <number> periods of the wheel of law the first one got shortened to <number> years significantly due to ordination of women and each period slightly shortened from its original <number> years due to immorality of monastics the world will enter decline and will end up in catastrophe the world will recover without the wheel of law but will generate very few enlightened beings until the next wheel of law is rotated this time by maitreya buddha however the recovery time is described in tens of thousands of years so buddhism deals with collapse very well pretty much baked into the teachings,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadFA1bTRmb0pXb1FhekE4bWFzY2dUWWZtcThMdGx1OFZMM1JacWNQdFk3emV5M0JlLWotX3djZUo2WEZxR3FNSk1sT2NsMi1YU1hvUFFaMjNwVGMzenc9PQ==

christianity and perhaps the other abrahamic religions may face a reckoning when the collapse of the biosphere becomes apparent there is the edict found in genesis that gives mankind dominion over the earth and god blessed them and god said to them be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth the word for subdue in hebrew iskavash to literally put your foot on the neck of a defeated enemy but the root word in hebrew for have dominion over isradahwhich relates to the meaning descend go down wander and spread or to walk among as followsthe lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and take care of itgenesis <number><number> niv to work it comes from the wordabadwhich means to serve to till ie to cause to flourish its clear that the biblical justification for mans domination of the earth includes an order to tend protect and cause the earth to flourish and the bible makes clear that this power is only delegated to mankind the earth is the lords and all that is in it the world and those who live in itps <number> heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the lord your god the earth with all that is in it deut <number><number> the land is mine with me you are but aliens and tenantslev <number><number> it may become clear to many people of this faith that mankind has broken this divine order and used our dominion over the earth to poison and destroy it and both the old and new testament makes clear that god will hold us accountable for such a crime revelations <number><number>the nations were filled with wrath but now the time of your wrath has come it is time to judge the dead and reward your servants the prophets as well as your holy people and all who fear your name from the least to the greatest it is time to destroy all who have caused destruction on the earth ezek <number><number> <number> niv woe to you shepherds of israel who only take care of yourselves should not shepherds take care of the flock you eat the curds clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals but you do not take care of the flock you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured you have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost you have ruled them harshly and brutally therefore you shepherds hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says i am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock i can imagine an extremist movement within the abrahamic religions taking up these passages as part of a potentially violent backlash against modernity perhaps under some kind of charismatic cultleader preaching the end times,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMWdfT2RsV1pxY3dtZWNzaVY4Tl9uMEtEUW9HWEZ2WnZqODkyV08zMEg5S3o1WTd5UlJxTGxvZWNpVS1Bajhtb0VIWTdfWjJHMzl5cVRrUlhHYnBHTHc9PQ==

in buddhism one of the most important thing we teach people is all feelings of unhappiness and worry stems from <number> craving for pleasurable things <number> craving for becoming <number> craving for non becoming part of the reason we suffer when we are encountering tough social situations is that is i loved and unpleasant so violates our desire for pleasurable things it also directly threatens our sense of safety and self so threatened our craving for becoming and if we are trapped in it and cannot escape so threatens our sense of non becoming in this case unpleasant becoming recognising this all our distress and displeasure are internal they are all driven by our own head our own wants and desires therefore the solution around this is mostly internal with only some external buddhism does teach that we have some external control we have some external control and where we can of course we should try to fix it for example our personal health situations which could be improved by exercise and better diet should be something we get a handle on we should save more money if it is a monetary issue we can deal with the buddha actually taught this by the way we can set aside if we have land a few trees for birds to stay in so we should however something as major as political and social changes are outside us as individuals so we should instead focus inwards on those things or move somewhere else buddhism does encourage renunciation and abandonment when things cannot be changed externally,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaW1TZ0VIZFkxZU5XR1VBdkxQR0djM0pyUXRSYndKTXFDaUpCZXo1RDM3LWVRNVo5UUZ4eFNwb1pVOWhIMEN6ZGRZb0FkQWxsYW45X0VHVmpMUTFJU1E9PQ==

i think ive given you the wrong impression somewhere im certainly not demonizing joe biden or the democratic party generally what i said was its not out of the question that he registered republican to vote against him just for the primary potentially in spite of whatever political leanings he may or may not have had i did not claim he was democrat liberal socialist leftist antifa or whatever else that would imply that he was aligned in some way with the democratic party or favored joe biden to win the election what i was attempting to do was remind people that without adequate knowledge of a persons beliefs and motivations we shouldnt assume that we know what they are this is a fraught situation and we should approach it with cooler heads and some selfreflection it is entirely possible that we could be pointing our collective finger at the other only to find us pointing at ourselves and yes i picked an absurd example because it was absurd but in this day and age not entirely out of the question remember the nashville bombing where someone believed the conspiracy theory about g so deeply they blew up an att building this is the dystopia we live in where people young gullible and easily swayed could believe and potentially act on the craziest of ideas i dont think that never trumpers who hate trump enough to want to kill him still call themselves republican after <number> years of him running the party its why the ranks of independents are swelling and the republican party is <number>+ in the bag for their candidate on top of that never trump republicans tend be moderates and moderates dont have a track record of assassinating political candidates my personal suspicion completely unfounded of course is that this shooter was trying to start a wildfire more than he was trying to kill trump whether thats because hes jumped into the deep end of the rightwing internet cesspool or has been taken in by accelerationist beliefs or even selfradicalized into an islamic state jihadist i cant say any of those things are possible but its also possible he thought the only way to save america from a future dictatorship is by committing an assassination its possible he frequents this subreddit and in dismay of the future decided to take matters into his own suicidal hands to give his life some meaning before he goes all of these motivations are possible and maybe if we are lucky well find out if one or none of them are true but we shouldnt say we know with any certainty what his motivation is because of a single piece of information like supposing because his parents are republican which cnn was reporting his mother is a registered democrat and his father a libertarian and therefore assuming that piece of information gives any gleaning into his mindset ill add that im a liberal in the classical sense and while i dont label myself a democrat most of my political values do align with the democratic party i think that joe biden has done a better job with the crazy state of the world that he was handed and far better than most anyone could possibly have done in the same situation but hes a pisspoor salesman im not sure if that changes your opinion of anything ive said but i imagine we are probably more alike in our political opinions then dissimilar,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZVpvOFY4Mk5hNTVqb2pTQkdUQjNwUl9HSldvaFNhTElvYy1lbnVFS2hlemRBTGRNbG9VN3JhUk90X3ZwcHB3cXhRYzdpaW45d3pxMmVQd01CZ1pRbVVQUTZhWVRkMWJBWFdHd3V1TlFtYTQ9

students in school teacher wow it turns out that the boiler room cant be turned off anymore and people that arent us built the school out of bricks of flammable cancer so we need you students to work as a group to figure out how to make the school safer and to make sure everyone learns the doors are going to be chained so leaving the school isnt possible now your assignment is to save yourselves before the school burns down or everyone dies from the heat there are snacks in the fridge but you can only have them if you do an unrelated bullshit worksheet or build more flammable cancer bricks or report one of the other students and have them sent to time out dont worry we did give you bottles of water and the class bully has even been given a list of which water bottles have a special ingredient that is flammable cancer now some of your classmates were told about the flammable cancer three weeks ago but the flammable cancer company offered them candy to not talk about it or money if they told everyone that flammable cancer isnt real they will start the project having pizza soda and ice cream with me in the front of the class the rest of you can join us too but you have to say there is no such thing as flammable cancer between bites now you should probably all get started good luck im going to see if any of these keys i have that could unlock the doors for everyone open the active shooter emergency room i can hide in so i dont have to watch you all suffer the tvs are set to pornography a video montage of our last school shooting and touched by an angel the brand new computer in the back room will feed you candy every time you watch the commercial you could ask it for how to complete the project but if you ask it the wrong way it will kill a random number of students and if one of the pizza party kids is on the computer you have to wait taking turns matters,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmRsWmY1cHdTeVlhY1hPcGdHdnFFSnc0eWNZbVVURnN5ai1yWlVCZ2NzRmJFaVlZaDNHdGJIR25yeXFBNzNrNzlOWXpGSUQ5cnYycm55cEczNDlMdFE9PQ==

america hasnt been a democracy in a very long time theyve just gotten a lot better at manufacturing consent from the definition of fascism in brittanica >although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from one another they had many characteristics in common including extreme militaristic nationalism contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites and the desire to create a volksgemeinschaft german peoples community in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation fascism is opposed to democracy >and if you create the rules and others find ways within those rules to get arou d your particular intent you cant then decode you want to change the rule to benefit your side at the expense of the others i mean most of us havent had a hand in creating the rules and there are a lot of things politicians do both inside and outside the official rule of law that dont align with democratic principles nepotism funneling money to big corporations that gave them massive campaign donations etc those corporations have successfully lobbied for the interests of the rich for decades to push us politics further and further to the right i recommend the docuseries century of the self the guy who founded the public relations field and coined the term manufacturing consent is edward bernays freuds nephew its on youtube,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQk1TWFYzcHV0Y3MzZlpPNmFhanBxMTd2NzVxMkEwN2UtNDFzUlRrZ0N0aDAyOGhBdmtBdlBrM1k2bGZCRHlxVWxvSU5FT0xyTTRVOVhxX1hoMVBiUEI2X0NLNUFSZ2dwWVh1LVdBT0xIaUk9

while others have answered perhaps an analogy would clarify this the earth bank account has some arbitrary total value say <cur><number> and produces say <cur><number> annually in interest we humans are spending almost <cur><number> a year this doesnt seem like a lot compared to the total but it is depleting the principle it may take a seemingly long time to deplete the total principle but remember that there is less interest each following year because of the shrinking principle and we continue to grow our spending practically exponentially in the last couple centuries the analogy is missing pollution and other forms of degradation but for illustrative purposes tells us the same as the article something bad is going to happen at some point if we continue as usual and as we love to say probably faster than expected some would point out that reducing our consumption is a form of collapse as well so essentially nature and physics has us by the balls,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhOTVzVWs0M25TcVdUZ2Zzd25LbUZLYmtrckFhZVY5emNqenBJbkhHN3U4SWNkY09uZUMtSVpEcnFUY2tSZHBqejY4ekZiLWRZZDFNWXZWTjduLVJEd3c9PQ==

no not the most friends with guns sensible honorable friends that stand aside and allow people to handle things fairly oneonone with their own guns fists knives whatever doesnt have to be guns it just has to be without the interference of law the rule of law is what allows a mod of majority opinion to enforce things on others a person has no right to walk somewhere unless they also possess the person capacity for violence that allows them to walk there by the fact that no one wants to challenge their assumption of that right in short you dont rely on laws to stop people from somehow interfering with you or your property you stop them and when you reach the point where you no longer can someone else takes over from you i think perhaps you may want to watch more nature documentaries or something to help you see how the natural world functions without the artificial construct we call civilization because i dont want to be civilized sounds like being domesticated both are the same either enforcing security with violence by a large number of people or enforcing security with laws backed by a large number of people at the end of the day you are still trying to tell others what they can and cannot do and if they dont do what you want them to well you put them in jail that is the essence of might makes right the individual should always be the highest law for that individual,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhMjkyVVI5dXF4amhKNkdQQ1RWdlpqSjdqTmRzUFE5VnRrZDBtMFk2MEIzZXJnM19EMDRUZ18xX1RDS0tsSC1ncWRJWE9OUDJNU19uY2FxMXI0NnFybmc9PQ==

i think it all relates to the adaptive cycle during the growth phase there is an arms race to increase complexity and consume more resources to literally grow that transitions into stagnation or conservation phase when behavioral sinks take over to reduce individual energy expenditures in order to maintain eroi as resources diminish and competition increases due to overshoot then the collapse phase occurs faster than the growth phase due to the seneca cliff effect where the population comes back into equilibrium with the newly diminished carrying capacity due to overshoot at this point there are <number> outcomes for a species extinction or reorganization assuming reorganization new traits will be selected for according to environmental pressures that are very different from the dominant traits selected for by the old paradigm a species may exist in a poverty trap for a very long time post collapse where they will either slowly develop traits that allow growth to resume or fade into extinction at the mercy of environmental conditions beyond biological organisms physical abilities to adapt,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYXBuQnFFMXdiZUdNb0RxTE5Ia29VMmVBUjcyRDg4V3N0VE50M0dGYndXVXNuVHAwTmtHSzlBbjR1Q2ZHRzRPM0ZQb1dhbnZOY2hXUHJmX1ptZmFfcGc9PQ==

i think the underlying issue to all of this is poor risk management companies and especially individuals are pretty good most of the time at risk management if the effects of x are really bad dont let x happen the problem is theres been no risk management at larger scales for many many decades now liberal governments have gone complacent thinking they are at the end of history and the rulesbased system that got them there will continue into perpetuity reality is anything but that nobody wants to believe that nebulous decisions about their life need to be decided by experts but holy shit we need managed societal risk yesterday many three letter agencies have decent narrow plans eg nasa probably has a protocol for a threatening asteroid collision but theres a layer missing above that which looks at all existential risks and attempts balance the resources devoted to them i dont know how to bake something so complicated into a democratic process the only way out i see is a technocratic systems engineering branch of government more or less equal in power to the others the fourth branch of the us government which solely follows the laws of thermodynamics,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX1VjSnFicE1hdFBJcUtuS2xYSFEzd0FYVlluWWp2emhhZFpkb3RNZU1DdGFaSkNYeWhKQkFCdzdsRGpkbmpCLVJmZlVmMFJYWTNaLVRHc0pOS0lQalE9PQ==

actually aircraft encounters with turbulence involving storm systems are lower than ever the reason is that reduced minima with aircraft separation allow for more deviation with greater ease so flying in bad weather is actually safer today than it has ever been we also have far superior image products including all sorts of groundbased and airbased radar and satellites and of course technology that allows pireps to databases in real time its almost unfathomable but just a few decades ago when you flew you basically had a weather forecast and maybe a sounding and that was it you got your weather via ground stations and flight service stations and local atis reports today due to endless streams of data all over the atmosphere there are much more and much better tools in use constantly and it allows the arena to be a lot safer for all participants no matter if youre in aviation or not anybody who watches a whole gaggle of commercial airliners poke through holes in storm systems on radar gets a absolute fucking kick out of it i mean its really something to see the pilots will be in a holding pattern over a fix and theyll ask yeah wed like to fly <number> miles east we want to point and take a look again and see if we can find a gap through that storm and we say go for it pathfinders can then fly through the storm and typically you can fit a few planes through that gap its safe but this was impossible just a few decades ago this is all possible because of onboard radar systems ive even seen tcas procedures be used for separation in situations involving bad storm systems but thats a bit out of the scope of what were talking about now with all of that said i believe what you are talking about is clearair turbulence<url> which the media has been reporting on clearair turbulence doesnt involve a mesoscale storm system its particularly notable in the northern latitudes due to the north atlantic jet stream especially in the nat tracks<url> its worth reading about in <number> years ive only encountered severe turbulence once it was pretty intense you could hear it in the pilots voices when i was at zny i worked in two different control areas which is rare one was a busy domestic radar area and the other was an offshore nonradar oceanic area this area dealt with a lot of the north atlantic flows into other areas and off to shanwick gander piarco etc from jacksonville center miami center and boston center new york center runs the two oceanic areas technically zwy turbulence is still pretty rare across that area but reports are increasing bad storms have always been associated with turbulent rides nothing new there planes avoid them asking for deviation clearances sometimes hundreds of nautical miles away if the flows are impacted that much especially in the nonradar oceanic environment pilots talk to their company dispatchers and air traffic controllers so theyre wellinformed of turbulent areas its not like theyre flying blindly into a pocket of air and suddenly exclaim holy crap thats exceptionally rare but it does happen which is why you should keep your seat belt fastened at all times a big part of this is the unsaid responsibility of the controller the primary goal of the air traffic controller is safety but it also involves efficiency and expediency avoiding turbulence is part of all these a good controller works with the aircraft to manage their sector of airspace or area of control and even more so if working in a tower on the ground where the whole pattern might need reconfiguring its a fascinating field the fact that people dont know much about it is a good indication that its working well i was a former atc at new york artcc and now i work at faa hq in air traffic operations and training material,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnc1FVYnRlTmxCZ0tyMFFjZGh6T28yczR0TE5BNTNrMzV0UFVURjduTVE3TDkwTjZnOHpkSzN4dTNoUG5wY3pkdFRXV2tyMXQ4blowZVAtVGdFSDlVS3c9PQ==

perhaps its the easiest answer but my answer would be when we had to start using the haberbosch process to feed our population we have a lot of natural gas but its still not sustainable on human timescales and we can create hydrogen which is reformed from the natural gas with blue methods but that is still energy intensive so when we had to move to synthetic nitrogen instead of bird poop that was big indication our population is not sustainable in any longterm way and perhaps its not worth stressing over that at the time you dont know what the future will hold perhaps theres a way to create infinite h and no consequences to the process except that people will starve without food now but now weve found out what the future holds which is climate change from fossil fuel usage and evereroeidiminishing resources i really like the book the alchemy of air as a look at the history of this from the guano to haberbosch and its effects on the world wars given it can also create explosives with ammonium nitrate would highly recommend giving that a read,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWmpIcHZ0b1NPcmh1R1c5MHNYNXM5Y3pYRXUyWUtYREVRS0VVSnh6Ylh1bDdkeU1tV2tfQmFDc1ZGWlVpSFY5eTdnY2d6dEtRcGROTzNWNy1abV9NZEE9PQ==

there is one way that both creates it transports it to the field applies it and mixes it with the soil already present in a easily plant available form moreover its extremely scalable even to the global scale and to less developed nations and its kinda telling that you didnt think of it andor dont seem to be aware of its potential the tricky part is that it requires eventually very similar amounts of energy i am speaking about legumes used in regenerative agriculture the energy use is an interesting fact that seems to be ignored in so many of the still prevailing technocratic discussions about ecological issues people only see the energy we humans produce and transport around and almost entirely ignore the energy flows the ecosystem provides for us haberbosch like so many processes to date is ultimately due to the carbon pulse we use abundantly available energy from fossile sources to power things at an energetic level that is far beyond the previously sustainable level we turn gasoline into fertilizer with which we produce yields also higher than in the previously sustainable system we borrow the sunlight put into the ground over the course of millions of years to increase the energy and material flow of things that do also flow without it and also powered by sunlight,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUEY5bjd3cUlSR3AyUHhCWlM4MzcwMG5UM0c4S1NfdF9iTDFSc09EdWxueURWVzc2WTZ0VVVnUldDQzFxOUNEb3FlVzdSdVU0V0VKbVl1aXlidXBuUEE9PQ==

hm i understand your scepticism it would be a fascinating research question i do think one aspect why it hasnt been tried before could be because its extremely labor intensive and maybe its only profitable in terms of food output with modern cultivars perhaps we simply didnt have the free labor density before and then our development took a turn where armies had to be maintained to secure the then still scarce resources and where then other tech came in to take the functional role of increasing nutrient density haberbosch and all of a sudden we were locked into the capitalist technodictatorship we have now that tries to solve everything based on extraction and progressing tech with the surplus to drive more extraction and sometimes solve existential questions if its convenient now that we have the labor density people prefer to believe the lies of the extractors because if everybody just digs enough everybody can eventually be free supposedly edit i do also have a thought about the free market i think the problem is that companies are individual entities that have to fight against other such entities as long as one such entity cant extract enough capital to guarantee its survival to the share holders there is no viable option to refill common goods due to race to the bottom situations hence the stuff every company profits from even down to care work deteriorates increasingly until the noncommodifiable stuff is gone it seems as though ecosystem services or natures contributions to people still arent commodified enough to be active as economic entities reflecting the limited pool of natures entities not sure whether a truly free market could solve this but im still thinking on it any input is welcome,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWW16T3dEVWZfNmZoSVlpZ2cwX3A1WERiS08xdjJjR0Y4SkNFa1ZaR2tPblVaYnR5MVZKLXdnem1sdEJFNWFxVEl5V0d5QkNUTVdtTGdMSWxXTDJFbkE9PQ==

interesting to be honest i dont remember the summers maybe because in the part i live heatwaves are ordinary and usual so even if the total of days with <number>+ temps was bigger than before perhaps i didnt notice it because im so used to such weather what i mostly remember from the <number> <number> decade regarding the climate is that its winters where colder at least locally than what i remember from the s and s we even got a snow layer of about <number> to <number> cm for several days each consecutive year in the place i live that caused troubles in traffic even though the norm in the s and s was to perhaps see a few snowflakes falling for an hour or two every year but it was unimaginable up to <number> to wake up and find everything covered with a layer of snow so thick it forced us to not go to work and stay indoors for several days many people where also unprepared and where running out of necessary household stuff,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSFowa19iV1JSTGVpbXRTN2pMUG1JZll1VTI0RzZiYmZYalNnVG1vbHVybHg0QUdKQ2x3OEpQYS1McGNnVnZqN3hVNmoteklUR0R6VVk5aUhaSW5ZblE9PQ==
exactly peter zeihan a renowned geostratigist used by many industries and government organizations talks about the impossibility of going green based simply off the materials not existing the capacity to manufacture within acceptable costs not existing eg an ev sedan costing luxury vehicle prices or an ev suv well into the sixfigure range thus not pragmatic for the average consumer and the impossibility of delivering an all green solution to underpin civilizations energy requirements <number> evs alone cannot be achieved thats before we even consider the charging infrastructure green energy and infrastructure for industry homes and public the world would have to rip everything out and replace it with components made from materials that simply do not exist in the volumes we need anywhere earthwhat he doesnt mention but what you are concluding is exactly what this means the idea of all green is an illinformed pipedream that amounts to nothing more than idealistic value signaling as nihilistic as it sounds evs are nothing more than another consumable to capitalize on others value signaling its not going to change a dmn thing the only practical current solution to energy needs is fossil fuel the world needs significantly fewer people probably no more than a few hundred million before we can think about going green heres an idea counterintuitively double down on fossil fuels to energize quintupling down on technological research and development for hydrogen fusion artificial fossil fuels and directair carbon capture if we make it great if not it doesnt matter anyway no reason to restrict ourselves either way nature will solve the problem wars are likely and famine is assured keep your loved ones safe,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNWc4VUkxNVZVS1ZFYTZUSmozRUxCR1pGNmRtZjdsZmJ1ZFdMVE1MN3VxN1c4RG9OOUwyX3JSNVlwN193LW54QVY1TS1NSkxYd1JaLU81WWJSaEpZeEVYWFc2eG9ZNV9LdWVZem9SRmJ6MWs9

labor is an interesting aspect im not sure how expensive labor was when we had the food crisis which brought on synthetic fertilizer i would imagine at the time manual labor was highly sought after compared to now with so many sectors automated i guess one good part of a laborintensive process like legumes and plants can it be automated much is the low startup costs compared to building an ammonia plant and definitely agree on the missing parts of the free market not accounting for the use and pollution of natural resources is a huge blind spot in it were already bad at it and the us will likely just get worse now the chevron case was overturned,r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOVhtMG02WHJobmg3UW8xTnJJY2xXVHZadUNwWlpiOFJDMldLOHlMX0xDSFU1dDUtdXFTODNxcDVfR2VTNFkzSEdkYm5waVB4YWc5QVplM2FROGVONFE9PQ==
