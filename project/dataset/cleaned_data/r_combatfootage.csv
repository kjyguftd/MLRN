this type of drone almost certinally receives no human guidance after launch there are some very high tec systems that can use automatic optical guidance through their entire flight through terrain recognition but it is unlikely that this drone uses such an expensive system other tactical drones use optical tracking with human targeting but strategic drones are not well suited for that due to the problems of communicating over long distances it is most likely using a positioning system coupled with inertial navigation as this can be done cheaply with readily available equipment that is resistant to jamming as an entire system even if the positioning system is often jammed,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVZ4Sk0xdDBMMEg4dmRGZ3gtVkhKOUlBenJpTHZtdHpzUmpDcUMwQXpZdWk1dm9saFV4bUxtWXlpajhoOUs1WnNqMjQ3QlFMMW5hZERRTEhxNmkxNnc9PQ==

okay this is quite the stretch cs gas has never been proved to cause any deaths us army basic training requires you to enter an enclosed space with forty people and inhale cs and no one has ever had any adverse health effects from it at us army trainings like ntc they will heavily gas entire battalions andy let those units sit in that gas all day even if someone forgot to pack their pro mask cs is also very heavy and tends to settle to the ground quickly i dont have the glasses inserts for my own promask so i tend to put it on wear it for about five minutes then take it off and wrap a bandanna or shemagh around my face instead it still sucks but you can still hold a fighting position and see just fine cs is nowhere near as bad as actually harmful chemical weapons you really think a nerve agent that will kill you in minutes or blistering agent that will leave painful boils all over your body is as bad as the tear gas that cops spray across entire city blocks,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTzlDazhoNUFwLVpkV2tSRTIyVEZDUTF3T2Z2ZWs3cm9xVjl4YmRQUkxTZUhnWUUwdHhzZlpERXBabzg0MlNma1dDaXBlaFBibHUxUFFVRGNEMHQ4VUE9PQ==

depends on the agent we had our mopp gear with us at all times and two atropine injectors i think the only time one of ua was hospitalized was tripping near one of the dump sites and getting blister agent contaminated dust in their eyes now my personal theory is that most of the incidents were pretty localized and the sensors and alarms were very sensitive and they didnt want us using a mopp suit for every alert since we were there for a year i do have weird neuroligical issues and muscle twitches as i get older i cant know for sure but it could be the exposure was at trace levels,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMU9fRXlQZDlleWY1MXpEWGRKb2h5dXoyc3RPU0ZpbnJPRWRhUEFCSDZpXzZETnlqR1hnbWZobmUwQU1sRnZJSEM3cGQ4RXY2TnNWWjRZbFJwTlhjUXc9PQ==

i actually like talking politics because i like finding common ground with people i absolutely do believe you i would like to tell you why so heres my life story keep with me because its a little long my first exposure to the concept of war guns explosions the wider world the concept of geopolitics crime cartels england germans geopolitical opinions came from cars <number>i completely didnt know that works isnt always daisies and roses i was five at the time theres a lot of conclusions that funnily enough i can retroactively draw from this movie its funny how many conservative themes this movie had electric is the future but people do take advantage of this transition billionaires dont have your best interests in mind racing benefits from tourism and vice versa controlling oil reserves in the future is important theres something called climate changetheres something called intelligence agencies and the military oil cartels the concept of torture littoral combat ships can be referred to as little crappy ships ive always been in this politically homogeneous suburban city i was told by my parents that we were middle class and i believed that because i knew people that who lived in brand new moroccanstyle houses and people who rented them i thought apartments were for the poor because i never saw them turns out that was false home ownership wasnt as common as i thought the world wasnt as equal as i thought not everyone could afford a college education i was more fortunate than most because both my parents were college educated and the suburban town i lived in was upper middle class we were more middle class but the median household income was k pre fourth grade i in essence thought that outright racism had been ended by mlk i didnt think about the effects of the financial crisis of <number> all i knew was obama and hes black and hes the president so thats how i knew that racism was no mostly no more mostly because i thought that mostly all white people were not racist and the racist people arent actually racist theyre just misguided plus theres not a lot of them anyway so i wouldnt care that much turns out that was wrong plus i had all these east asians and indians friends theyre smart and im friends with them thats how i thought i knew i wasnt racist but i still thought that it must suck to be black because people are racist plus you would have dark skin i had some internalized racism but i thought there was no way i was racist because i knew about not being racist and racism just came from ignorance that was also wrong i realized that a lot of other progressives had also internalized that stuff too politics basically entered my life in <number> i was in fourth grade ive basically seen blue vs red as good vs racism all my life and trump was told to be the big bad racist american i thought since progressivism would wins hillary should be elected plus i thought there would be no way that what trump said would resonate with people then trump got elected and it shook that belief that progressivism always won again i was in fourth grade did this mean that progressivism isnt always right what i equated conservatism with moral bad but trump didnt make everything morally bad and then he didnt build the border wall which i thought was a good idea even though the way he sold it was deliberately otherizing towards mexico then trump killed soleimani the quds force major this was a touchpoint momement for me which i agreed with i had always agreed with the war on terror more than the average bernite even so i still equated conservatism with racism and therefore it would be bad covid capital riot biden midterms my opinions didnt change in fact they were reinforced but invasion of ukraine happened and my information gathering went into hyperdrive i instinctively disagreed with russia because theyre a geopolitical threat of the us hegemony and i do think that the us hegemony is a net good ive been trying to understand more about the world rather than just the basic la times and new york times diet ive been getting trumps back on the ballot so i really wanted to understand why people thought that way i didnt see those videos because i guess ive been in a partial echo chamber the blm riots were really glossed over and talked about more in an abstract good vs evil sense ive never seen those videos but i am nuanced enough to know to believe that that couldve happened and it would be incredibly concerning for a white trump supporter those video does sound chilling please do send them,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblV4TmZzNmdKQnQ1WTUwSkJVMGR2ZHNFQ3N4ZE11d2pkLXhzODRvcWJBNzJWOUZvSGR1Z1IyUnFXV0dLbXQ1OGRKbG5xdkltVEtRdDlBNHFQd0RWRWc9PQ==

when ukraine fights they fight aggresively and surprisingly effective now i will give you this ukraine is probably the most experienced country in the world when it comes to conventional warfare so they obviously have a headstart but when you are fighting dudes in sandals and your whole convoy hides from them that says more about you as a fighting force than them lol americas military is currently geared for counter insurgency warfare the switch from that to conventional has been painfully obvious when we see how useless nato training has been so far we simply arent ready for an actual war and not just an outrageously unfair war lmao our pride is gonna be our downfall just like how america used to be the greatest place on earth now its on of the worst i always say complacency is the cancer of warfare and russia has stage <number> america has stage <number> rapidly approaching stage <number> if you think you are the best then you probably wont make the necessary improvements to remain the best anyways im not uninformed i just like messing with you guys like damn i just made a bunch of people super mad with words on a screen also if america enters a real war and not a pretend one id be willing to bet you they would be pulled out by their own people america is too divided to wage a war rn,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNGY4OFpVcjFuaHh6ZEZIOW52ZVVmUnFpUVJITGktUHNqY05LbHZtcFpvMXlOclpzempfNDdGR29wYnFsbkJZYjdZRGhzdGtuVXBXZzRCdFFmMElXTkE9PQ==

russian storage and equipment numbers has become more and more interesting to me over the past year or so i think its the key for ukraine to wear down this gigantic stockpile to such a degree russia wont be able to mount serious offensive actions with enough quality and that the lack of armored quality reduces the potential effectiveness of the attacks ofcourse a t<number> is still deadly but russia has a higher chance of capturing its th oleksandrivka in donetsk and the random treelines up in luhansk if their armor is in a better shape that what is currently the case its also not really something russia can fix you exactly cant just spawn in more vehicles so this sovietarsenal theyre fielding is a card they can only play once and as long as ukraine gets the aid they need which is a whole other case then it will be interesting seeing how russia will adapt to this im guessing they will just keep attacking still but with even more emphasis on infantry since they seemingly is fine with killing thousands of their dudes every month it helps that a bunch are mercenaries from other countries im sure despite how inhumane that is theres also the future implications of it regardless of what happens in ukraine over the next few years the big advantage russia had over basically any country in europe was this absurd number of armor with that gone theyre quite hamstrung for a long time which is good news to countries like the baltics,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNk1nb3ltNjFGNzdmZXY2SzRYSlE0S3hWdFEzakc4amlROXJwblFDNEJMbzlhWnlrcjJKUHozdkQwcnBndHZpSDh2eTJqTExBQTB4Z2VxeWhtYU0xVEE9PQ==

it is mostly difficult because of the lack of warning and that it is difficult to know where to aim to attempt a lockon as they are so small and thin having a small crosssection so theyre difficult to spot they fly at near the speed of sound so you get very little warning from audible cues too ideally they pass overhead and you fire at them as they are flying away so you dont have to move around trying to track it but the window for doing so is very short as the heatseeker missile you fire after it has a short range although it is very fast so it can catch up and the heatseeker takes some time to acquire a lock so you cant just fire immediately so its quite easy for the target to pass out of range before you can acquire a lock so its a combination of being in the right place at the right time combination of skill and luck since you can predict where they might travel and be there waiting for them and a lot of skill to actually carry out the shot successfully,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa0FyY3BoQ0MwOE82LWJKNlgxUXhmcURoS2VxZmpmS3RGQUstVkl6MFlfWU5wN2p4clh0aTFCdzhUZGhKVUFPNm83bU9vNkRMMzhrSXduTXo4ZnlycVE9PQ==

weird timeline the ppk were instrumental in the defeat of isis as well as protecting turkey from isil fighters who were fleeing back to the west via the northers borderlands but of course nationhood is often forged in conflict and the kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world without a nation not going to lie i know several kurds and ive met folks who have fought with the ypg i hear nothing but good things about em but now apparently theyre not our friends anymore and were just all okay with allowing turkey to eliminate them the same turkey that has secret meetings with russia and wants ukraine to accept surrender and nato to appease the invaders seems bizarre,r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVWpfdmljYXdlc19ZbkE3LTZTUHRvLUJ1MGVSWDV1cDlHcGRYVkNBQklUZndvaVQyVGg5MExLTnZYbHFpVlNFUml4T2V6Y0RPVGpkVm10WlhENkNDLWtUUGEtSFBRd01PSnpiR3FPemtQemM9
