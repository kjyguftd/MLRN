im no expert man but i would assume they can somehow monetize a portion of the outstanding obligation they can transfer the guarantee to a financial institution which then advances the money at a discount divisible sblcs makes the process easier keep in mind that currency fluctuations can be an incentive say the dollar is overvalued as compared to the local currency they can monetize part of the obligation on a high,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUDRfN2ZQZTY0VXBuR2xWTGF4RXFCd2hudV9SbUJ2N2NpdjRObzRBRExwZ1dFb0RxV1pTTU1TSXp0SUg0MUFneHQ3UWVNaU1CeGNmR0piXy1PSmswWlE9PQ==

some similarities in the day to day some differences as well for one both physical and paper traders follow the market and all related indexes closely although with slightly different objectives the physical trader will search for opportunities within the market in the form of gaps and inefficiencies he will then determine if these inefficiencies have already been priced in before deciding to take a position the paper trader examines the same market curves but uses technical analysis combined with his knowledge of current market situation to determine if certain indexes or spreads are over or under priced this will help him to develop a trade physical traders require a good knowledge of operations since thats where money could be made or lost also many money making opportunities reside within the complexity of logistics so yes there will be an element of ops involved people around here often say the best way to break into the industry is to become a scheduler which is not wrong but my personal take is do whatever it takes to get your foot through the door and work your way from there earning potential varies with different commods across different firms there are both paper and phys traders who net <number> figures yearly everything boils down to how effective you are source physical gas trader with some experience doing paper,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRDlBWk9kdkJTOUpYdG4xZHJtbndXTzhXWjJrQVk5WW1SSUI5RkdBbkdza2pveVIyVWtQRFdZcjUtX1dpSWc2QU5sa3pZd1kyc2pBcjhDT0VIUVgtZ3c9PQ==

commodity trader basically takes the risk normally by upfront payment to the supplier and providing credit terms to the final buyer big trading firms normally purchase goods many months in avance or they commit themselves to purchase goods without knowing on papers how price geopolitics or weather will affect the goods by the time of contract enters in force this is why they hedge also they become tenders of the goods before you so you will have to go eventually through them,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS0l0dU8zRUZWMURRanU2NlRjbmlBeWp0XzVLTTJiYVRaVnRiejVtUW5ZdjJTVzRGZHlTc1V4R2lrdHp0czBzXzNEV2w2X0VDR0xTVFpzeFRtaWxYbHVwTmo3SFU3VVFsVkU0TF9mZmRSQU09

lol yes you will need to learn that map but it will take time a good trader and manager will give you grace on that at least mine did i would think this answer varies widely all pipes essentially schedule different and while the fundamental scheduling activities may be the same the economics of the pipe are different some have pools some dont some segmenting some dont there are also storage management interconnect management and cut management for my pipeline what helped me in the beginning was learning what my pipes scheduling priorities were and all my contracts paths i have roughly <number> contracts and understanding their primary rec point and del points helped me understand how i can get gas to areas on my pipe also understanding the economics of the pipe will help you should know all the rec points price action on your pipe you dont necessarily need to know the daily price but at the minimum know which has the cheapest gas where expensive gas is being sold and most importantly why example my pipe is in the east region gas is cheap on the west side of the pipeline and expensive on the east thats because theres a bottleneck in the middle where two sections converge one section is a <number> pipe the other is a <number> pipe both converge into a <number> pipe therefore theres a lower amount of gas that can make it thru in the summer you can get secondary in path thru usually secondary out of path will likely get cut during peak days you can guarantee only primary is getting thru maybe a small percentage of secondary in path makes it compressor stations at the interconnect on the west side can receive roughly k dth all the way thru to the choke point that choke point can flow roughly <number>k dth so because less gas can make it thru gas becomes more expensive east of that compressor station to add another variable theres not a lot of production east of that bottleneck further increasing price and then lastly the east side experiences much colder temperatures in the winter which can send prices thru the roof its not uncommon for me to see on a day in the winter were gas is selling for <cur><number> on the west side and then <cur><number> on the east side and <cur><number> in transco zs,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZekx4OHQ3azhMNkIxU29KTERYOENCeFJxQ0lVdjRWUTJCcGVtc0tLVFNUR3FPajJ6WlZJa1MyU09TMWlUUlBMa1BZUDRfdEVEZW04a01yRklPaVR5b1E9PQ==

scheduling is ideal if you want to get to trader because to trade a pipe you need to understand how gas flows on and off the system when scheduling you master your pipeline and are the keeper of this knowledge my trader scheduled my pipeline many years ago if he jumped on it he would be fairly lost therefore he relies on my forecasts and numbers to assist his trading strategy i would say it is difficult to get into scheduling there are zero degrees offered for it and last i checked theres no courses offered at any university in the united states dedicated to just scheduling i would assume there may be some graduate programs that have a course which may cover scheduling activities in one lesson additionally trading desks like to hire someone that already has scheduling experience or promote someone from within the company that has already been managing activities that support scheduling and trading functions like an analyst,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRllydzgxOUNoS3pGaGZfU3JYV1BoaVp3ZU9oWjlBbEItLWZJSlBxZ2dVYWRkNXlRT0VURDR5R3VsMEtXUWZZLWxsZFJwTmpTSTNQaHMtNEx4WFFxdmc9PQ==

hi grand depends on the utility and personalitysuch as edf and uniper imho are much more commercial and a bit more spec which means higher pay but higher job volatility the others i believe are going to be more straight buying for energy needs and sometimes selling for your career if you start at a noncommercial utility then you may be limited as pure trading houses may not see you as a creative thinker shouldnt be the case but ive seen this first hand so my simple advice is while you are young and mobile start at trading houses and you will learn the ropes in a high stresspressure but then youre equipped to go anywhere hope that helps brian energyroguecom<url>,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTR5ckdEVFNWY25UamtmOVFYbTdyaTFKNWFtSk85VThVODEtQUpwUWg2eFphRlFmdEJiMzlRWXhKWmNQb1JjUF83U0hud0tqdjBGM3VmRmh4MnNOd1E9PQ==

your mistake is that you think physical trading has nothing to do with option pricing mechanics you wont last long as a pro physical trader with that opinion option analysis provides you with mathematical levels of valuelike what is undervalued and what is overvalued such data puts you in a less risky position if you decide to go long or short or work a spreads value the risk manager and vp of trading where you work will want to know what the volatility of certain physical energy commodities if its a viable trading company your best competition will know option metrics and have them coded into their algos option basics are simple and if you have a command of them youll advance farther faster in your career but you be you,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQ0ZNRmwtV0NuekxJdzJSanBRZk9BSy1jTUZITWlFLVRPZXllRDRfdW5LWmYxUnRPZ20xcF8wSEdpREYwbzlHdVNLSmVZRUtNU3luaUtlUm1tNFUyckE9PQ==

it has elements of both obviously shipping side is a lot like oil but offtake and sale you need to deal with the gas side eg if you sell lng into europe you better know your stuff on ttf nbp and eu gas markets same for the offtake side you need to be pretty fit in hh market and dynamics and actually the shipping side is as well a bit peculiar you have eg boiloff during voyage which is a big factor in trading optimization on the other hand you have to deal less with quality or grade which plays a big role for oil so your gas is usually the same around the globe and you bring the lng to where its most profitable asia sea eu latam destination side is mostly accessible with pretty liquid futures so your difference discount of your physical lng vs your hedge is quite low on oil you usually have to optimize for the right refineries who run that specific grade etc some hedging can be done via ny futures but the grade and quality differences are quite substantial so you need to have a wider network for your shorts to make sure you can manage the risks so in way different than both or actually you need to master both worlds to excel at lng,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWE1mVFlsbHpaNENDN1dsbHprM2kxankzVXNVQ2g1ZGZhWlZtckZPa3VUeDhBRERhMUhLbjBTRkI3YlVVbUhnOU9MT3hXcUVXSWNzWG9RU0dUUHpkZHc9PQ==

jkm is a lng market not ng physical henry hub doesnt correlate with gulf coast lng its normally a net back from ttfnbp or jkm maybe important if you are in liquidation and an origination role but thats based off the nymex futures physical natty trading is a different beast understand actual physical european natty market might be useful kind of like its useful for a crude trader to understand the crude products market mogas jet but you are definitely not a master in european gas trading,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac3JmNlYxaEViVlZKNDhDd245SnM0SU8yWjI1a05za0JqRGxiZ2hzLUl5b3ZBd3VVOUM1X2hwMl9VemNBWTQySHZEZElNcmFQd1RTdjV0dTJsRlFQSnc9PQ==
fine jkm you are right hh when i was on one of the biggest lng desks we had substantial analysis data and exposure to hh many lng offtake contracts are priced hh<number> so surely whether the offtake is profitable or not depends on both hh and the destination market so you are right once the lng is on the ship its decoupled from hh but to get it there or not ie execute your takeoff option or not has lots to do with hh same into europe but you are right it may depend on the trading strategy you drive,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTzY2WURmMlNHT1hyR0pGRlo4ZVNRZjdBSVEzN3lSUW1TSjIyQklDVzgxanU5ZjNZbzFPSFJraS1CcGhMaDctbkJzTWptQjI5MEtPVGliNWhITXM5X2c9PQ==
so what is the implied volatility of the commodity and physical commodity you have to buy if you know the annual implied volatility you can divide it by <number> to get the daily price risk range above or below prior days closing price that way you can tell the boss we are buying at undervalue heshe will be impressed or we are buying at overvalue and perhaps should hedge heshe will be impressed also your boss will always ask <number> questions whats the commodity doing and next ok then where is it going option volatility math tells you where the banks are and what thy expect natenbergs book gives you all that math you can use to advance your career your peers wont be doing it you win even as a physical buyer you can produce a document spreadsheet each day like the banks do and pass it around the office for others to see pretty soon you are director then manager then vp think kindly of me at that time,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNnREeDNfUWFKNk9STHAwaUQzaWNFV1pTMW5HcVV6M1p0cXVQZG5LSzU0dHRDVjhXYk1FSTJzNzhLU1BVQW9CVFRPbjVuR0RoSWRPSzNnbmd6el82QkE9PQ==

there is often seasonality in commodities for example a lot of end users hedge natural gas at the end of summer in anticipation of increased winter demand opposite goes for the end of winter theyll sell the summer months obviously this one is pretty in your face but this kind of thing i believe is what he is talking about also certain people always go the same way on certain structures or you can tell who the counter party is by the structure that they are trying to trade,r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTmhMMzF0OWMyeEhsUzBVT1RaU09HYWIybDJOdDZoT0FwNURRR29ka2k4OWduYXdPSEVGbmMyUE5uRHF0V1VKME50ZkxZZnl0NDdvTXZYYlpFTVptOURTa29LeHZuWHZhcEtPdDUyeXFIU0E9
