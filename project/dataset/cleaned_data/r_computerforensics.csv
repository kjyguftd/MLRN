the suggestion seems to be based on the assumption that the malicious files contains the file name of the created file in clear text if it does a simple search should find it however good malware does not do that if it needs a specific file name it would either decoded or decrypted at run time or constructed at run time the only way to catch those i think would be to monitor openfile system calls with creation options turned on and any related calls that can be used for the same purpose for cases where the specified file name matches the one you are looking for basically you need to know or research the windows api is some detail and then use a tool that allows you to look for those details as the malware is running and autopsy is not that kind of tool,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWjM3YTJqZy0zTHl2X0JFV2tKN1lySTAwaEt1NnRDaVZvcDZUN3ljSWVLcVU3NjhXMjBfYmRLaG1ET0l0cHh1SDYtUDFuUzlaQVZoblI0NDdYR2FuU0E9PQ==

a few ideas <number> if this is related to your security implementation the first thing to try would be to run the same test acquisition outside of the environment if it succeeds you have your answer and you can talk to it further to get to the bottom of the issue <number> if your test accounts are on google workspace it is possible to disable the use of drive api there we can walk you through where to look in google workspace admin <number> with the new google granular consent it is possible to give an app partial consent so you may be inadvertently not authorizing the drive scope that is needed for the collection recent versions of fec support granular consent and detect such a scenario automatically if you are working with test accounts feel free to reach out to our support and provide a limited token we can run a test acquisition and report back ,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc2xwTmdkbk1sMWNmeVZ0SEs3d016Q29fTXFfV0UwaC0xeV85UEpCVE1Wc0pidzh0clN4VWgzX09GU2o3cF9mMExBNFFNc0xLR283YU04VncwUzJkLUE9PQ==

similar to regular ctfs you have <number> types jeopardy style where you would either get a disk image memory or sometimes even pcaps and asked questions which are submitted as flags secondly live fire ones where you get access to vulnerable network and asked to respond in real time as threats are introduced this is more of log analysis and incident response than diskmemory forensics but there maybe some elaborate ones which are conducted over a period of <number><number> weeks where forensics might come in handy,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVVZJQ04taWMxNUxiYkhRTGg5akt5X1E1VGtxaTluVXpBcUZON1ZWTWg2RFh1dUZuWnVJbkpEYUttQ0FsbUNlV1dlTzZQUTU3UlNvYjhLSjc0cFNWNHc9PQ==

analyzing the filestream itself will only work if you have access to the original file from the source if you got it from any social media site video aggregator whatsapp etc the video will have been reencoded and compressed causing any potential info or signatures in the headers etc to be lost best way is probably to analyze the video by its content instead and trying to find telltale signs of ai use such as incorrect amounts of fingers morphing body parts nonsensical objects etc,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYT2JTeHN6aVZicTIxU05zWi1mZWN6RVdEZWlMRUd2ZXlXQ0pFSlI4M1ROY0oxQXZiTjNZX3YzTFBwLVZkam1RTTc3RU5mazJBU3kzVm9LVFR1RzcwU1E9PQ==

hello all i have a specific question i deleted a text message thread from my phone that i really need to recover i use a moto g stylus g phone with boost mobile as the carrier the default app for texting is google messages and i have never previously backed up anything to google one or any cloud based backup program i know that google says that once they are gone they are gone and theres no recycle bin or trash but is there any way to recover them forensically i have called boost they can only give me call and text metadata but not the texts themselves and i have tried to contact google with very limited unhelpful results ive also reached out to a handful of private investigators who have been up front and honest that its pretty expensive and either may not or in one case will not work just hoping beyond hope here but getting discouraged,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMjNvaUh2WlV3ZURJOGR2Mm9PUU1xQWFaamFjVGJUb3BLa21mYVEtRWNLRFJUeHotMVZTTHZReE82Tl9LTUNzQkZTb1R0XzNTbzVDVVNjeVZQVmpFd2pjSEJxaWduMXB3OUJUdXp5ZHZob009

you can use any type of experience in digital forensics you just need to know how to adapt those into the field when i was younger applying for jobs i would say i have x background and i can apply that and give you a different perspective that would help you and your company you have to learn how to sell yourself being unique or having a different background could be good but you have to show the company how it applies to them for example you could say if we get a ediscovery case or you want to expand and to ediscovery i would be able to help when you ask what are the best certs the main question is what is your objective are you looking to learn are you looking to collect certs like pokemon or do you want to start thats recognizable in the field if the objective is to get hired certs arent really the best way to go,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb0hyb3pDMmhVcTRYcnFPc2xMY3BhazY0RDg4UVJIMnM1SGl6LUk5Sm9DdWFOa1oxaHdnVjZ0ZmRXQTd0R0VzcFowVV9LbXA1WEJWdFBUNDN0S2dLdXc9PQ==

in order to answer that lets look at it from the standpoint of the person you want hiring you say you personally are charged with a crime and the data on your pc cloud and phone can all prove your innocence your attorney hasnt had to use a computer forensic person before so they google computer forensic examiner and call them they also find your company listed as a company who does computer forensic work when you are interviewing the <number> parties so you can retain them on your case what would you want to hear from them in order to believe they can not only handle your case but also have a really good shot at winning your case the answers you want to hear from them is where you want to start ive taken the pck courses in canada and they did nothing for my cf side of work although the knowledge of firmware boot sectors pcbs and drive mapping was interesting to say the least i hope that makes sense as a hypothetical i can try to go into more detail if there is something specific,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZME1GNkxQRm1zR1hQa29iSVhtNTlxTnRWZkpMRnotSmVMd0dzYzJ5ZEU2Y3ZvamE4WklZQXAzdHZVLVpiVHVuanRWQmktR0hoODN0N1FLNzMzMzlGVjN4RFBOTl9oOXV1ek81aDNrQ3VZbTQ9

what youre going to find is that there really arent many of us in the industry theres no solid pipeline for dfir work but the work is there if youre willing to do it if you cant go the gov route next best option is mssp vuln management or sre try to pivot that way once youre in youre in dfir skillsets and the willingness to do the work is rare and valuable,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeHRhSzJ1X3pCbWZ0N1RWY0E4YWtra0Y2aGZWVkg2ODZCQzVxejVsOEdMdmgwWWt4cFpvcXgxZF9QMW9fWVdUXzVoUzZ1TGZQclJaWTE4eUlNUjdremc9PQ==
in terms of alerts our edr typically notifies us if something is executed or if there is any suspicious process we usually check the file path associated hash and command used sometimes we verify with the infrastructure or software team to determine if they initiated any actions in terms of incident response ir if any malicious activity is detected we need to contain the host and examine the logs from our edr to identify the root cause,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQXZzc3BmYzBQUFJBcWhNVzBPOGZ6Uk9MaFFxUTk4dXZacUgyMkpxNWcxN1NOSV9KRzJzamU0aTlOczQ4RkFQZ0l5bkFWc1NJM2ZtQmxudGkzUnNJXzREMjM0LW9EMHAzTXVqa25fTURhWjg9
i would caution against relying on the file path and associated hash to prove benign unless it was a detection from the hash based detection engine if the behavioral engine of your edr indicated suspicious behavior that should have more weight the process could have been injected into by another process loaded a dll via search order hijacking or otherwise been misused i would recommend zeroautomated and sektor courses covering blue and red side of malware however there is a significant amount of information for free if you look into malware reverse engineering on youtube john hammond malwareanalysisforhedgehogs oalabs etcfor example,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZLW1sQkhuMkpjV1E1NFV4cTdGTHFRUVkwNGV1ZjZBMlczbHV5c1pZV2hPbXhwYWVtdk5iQVBhM19pYkxzWHFHd0pIcVp3bG9veGpyNUxxS1UyUFUwc0E9PQ==

for computer forensics at least what i mean by the term you need to get closer to the software and hardware those parts that can done by searching documents and their metadata you already know but you probably also need to get security architecture under control so you can answer if user u could have access to file f directory d registry content r and so on for all controlled entities im thinking windows translate as required for other platforms at time t or in some period of time access control is not well covered by any of the usual books or cert training ive seen and forensic tools tend to bypass it altogether things change though and might have done so recently as well as other things often related to malware and nonmalware identified as malware by overeager antimalware products and not infrequently related to imaging and data recovery cf is also i believe more divided into expert fields a windows analyst is not usually useful for other platforms the purpose of computer forensics is to answer additional questions than those ediscovery addresses for windows id suggest something like a sysadmin cert from microsoft possibly with security engineering added to it those existed several years ago a quick glance through microsofts certification does not identify anything obvious unless it all is subsumed into microsoft <number> this will help you understand corporate it environments where things are not the same as in personal systems as always time spent in sysadmin roles and such are probably more worth than any forensic cert,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbFhNbmk0VE1PR1pfLVczR0t0ZUtHX01ILVpmcHVDVnh5bUNHRDJkdVN4VG5TWXRaeXlpQ193bERIbFBMVy1HQXBXMFZEQzJDbUFWRkZJaUpBU0xGYXc9PQ==

im going on <number><number> years in dfir and to be honest it is hard to get real experience in the area without living through an incident the biggest thing i have noticed when it comes to the work is the fact that you just need to be versed across everything because you never know what your going to be given my route to dfir was helpdesk for a number of years whilst studying cyber sec and then applying for a dfir job i got the job because of my years of experience working in helpdesk so my boss assumed in which he was correct that i would have a very good understanding of what an endpoint should look like so when i get something thats off i can see it pick it up straight away this has worked for me thus far ctfs would be the next best thing and i love doing them but they are generally far from the real day to day stuff so if anything i would say make sure you stay versed across all systems and get good and identifying what is normal so that you can show quickly what is not normal although given the money you currently on i would just stick with it and continue bettering your skills in all areas and focusing on something specific that you want to pursue as a hobby for reference my first dfir job was paying like k private sector in aus,r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRTMzSFZLQUhtNnBXMlYwa3loaHo0THBUTmdIVENFRFFkVTU0X2tUa21tUkN6a3g5U3VIV3J3d0ZWR1lvY1I2azljbWhvZEpycTNyOUNrLVlVZndHRkE9PQ==
