tube artillery is more efficient in terms of the propellant weight needed to push the same mass to the same distance compared to rocket artillery they do this by containing the propellant burn and accelerate the payload quickly this translate to you needing to ship much less propellants dozens times less to the gun rocket artillery is less efficient in this aspect because you accelerate and push both the warhead and the propellant in the initial stages and the propellant is burned as the rocket flies you need a dozen times more propellant for rockets than tube propellants are mix of fuel and oxidizers they are unstable with longterm storage meanwhile howitzer barrels have practically infinite storage life once slathered with cosmoline on the other hand because of the high and sudden acceleration in tubes its harder to make electronics that will survive the acceleration and than more gradual acceleration of rockets more of the tube shell need to be the steel casing most of the weight of an he shell is the steel casing the rockets warheads outer wall may only need to be a light aluminium shell leaving the hollow cavity to be filled with specialised payload cluster munitions scatmines thermobarics bunker busting etc tube artillery platforms are also heavier than the equivalent range and payload rocket platforms what this means in practice is that a gun that fires a shell to the same range as that of an atacms will be of ridiculous size and weight what this ends up in practice is that most tubes above <number> mm and about km with raps are scrapped conversely very few or no rocket system between the range of mm mortars about km and km unless the platform weight is an issue eg airborne troops it doesnt seem to be worth it to have an mbtbarrellength gun in <number> mm to shoot beyond about km with raps rip to erca probably barrel wear issues for very heavy payloads ><number> kg and ><number> km use aviation bombs,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZmxjekZZUGp6U0NROVlTN244dkh3emZncjZMZHhTNXE1dGRidm9OZVFrVS1FeXJpMm5icGpQaVRTS01ka2lkM0RCVGNRMFRvS2tGc1VGSHFjUnZRYThqZU11U3E2bF85Ni1ES1VoaFhORDg9
> its why russia did nothing when their red lines over western tanks cruise missiles spgs or anything else were crossed red lines have to be backed up by actual capabilities and willingness and russia has neither when it comes to war with nato they are committing sabotage targeted assassinations and other destructive acts on nato soil they can or have cause significant damage to undersea communication cables and such in the baltic sea so yes they do have avenues to respond and escalate and they are edit for example earlier this year the germans americans foiled an assassination plot against rheinmetalls ceo if that had succeeded how would nato respond if the russians miscalculate that response it can be much larger than expected which requires a counterresponse now you have an escalationladder out of control the worry isnt that nato cannot respond to escalations its that russia miscalculates and webs both sides in an untenable escalationladder,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYODUzZDFSNnlGM1RxZkJpUkFsU05saU8wc2JwTFU1U3ltOS1oVVN0dmZwQ1pRMlc5a2NFc25HMExaX1J5X0I0NDU4QnNvRUh4d195QVFJaVBUUl93ZXc9PQ==

there are likely several reasons but one of the big ones is scaling in the opposite direction with how plenty of older apartment buildings and industrial areas often double as effective bunkers the kgs are often insufficient for causing major damage to those hunkering down this is part of why ukraine can often hold out on these areas far longer than others this need can even be seen early war with mariupol where ultimately russia began to use these larger bombs unguided to address those hunkered down at the industrial plant in my opinion i wouldnt be surprised if they cause a lot more morale damage as well the removal of safety and overkill in some usage may cause units to not want to stay around where previously they felt confident,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWEw2a0Y4X0tHWDRpS1JaWFl2bVB2d0YyMzNpMnJZd19QZHB2MDd3cnB3a1ptYzlkcXFRVWFnVU8yMEZjRUFmLTRzbVhrZFJ4TF81eUFqWl85UU10U0E9PQ==

a bit unclear of how exactly this crackdown is going some say its ethnic with groups seen as fighting with the rsf like the nuer are being expelled while the others are being allowed to stay while being sent to the ethiopian refuge camps or its touch and go whatever the local army force choice over a thousand have been moved to refuge camps a bit of context pre war sudan had a million refuges though that in itself is a complex category with plenty of south sudanese first wave where people who never left sudan after <number> either because they settled down or feared the instability then another wave hit when the south sudanese civil war began a lot of those being returned are hostile to the south sudanese government looks like the sudanese air force has been using barrel bombs like the government in syria > the national observatory for human rights sudan expresses its deep sorrow over the bloody massacre committed by sudanese army aviation against unarmed citizens in the city of el geneina the capital of west darfur state the bombing operation left dozens dead and wounded most of them children and women aerial bombardments with explosive barrels against civilians are war crimes and grave human rights violations that have been committed by aviation in the darfur region in which regime aircraft have committed genocide against the population for nearly twenty years the observatory calls on international human rights organizations concerned with human rights to condemn the massacres committed by aviation against populated areas it is necessary to ban flights on the cities of khartoum aljazira sennar blue nile and darfur we call on the sudanese army to stop targeting civilians with explosive barrels out of respect for human rights first and in response to the united nations agreements that guarantee citizens the right to civil protection in areas of armed conflict <url> this requires a bit of context not justifying this but this barrel bombing is on a cleansed area the battle for geneina attracted international news for the rsf massacring <number> people in a week mainly non arabs and burying them in mass graves sometimes alive with the rest of the anti rsf population fled with their homes being taken over by rsf fighters and their families some of which came all the way from niger in other words this a indiscriminate attack on a opposition held area that killed civilians a war crime as a result of this though plenty on sudanese twitter as celebrating it given what the rsf have done to sudan the rhetoric of total war and atrocities committed have paved the way to this > video by rsf militiaman shows a double strike using guided missiles targeting a building in the army general command khartoum rsf militia uses guided missiles extensively

civilians as the saf takes the gloves off airstrikes and the nation continues to starve and rsf keep looting though aside from that one concerning issue has been ethiopias dam project egypts anxiety regarding it are well known <url> less well known is that sudan also had a lot of objections but both backdown as well as given how sudan gets its water is less a mortal threat than egypt that is should it be in a golden year without this horrendous civil war perfect harvest and things generally going okay you would likely see sudan have to transition to having their water supply and own damming projects for development being affected by ethiopias mega project i think you would see sudan suffering a bit no worries of that now given there was barely a harvest this year most of the population has been displaced gotten their crops robbed or decided to hoard it for their own survival than sell it its something id keep a reminder for the post war if it happens the sudanese pie

they have link <number> a data sharing protocol its s so it shares in the kbs rate but its enough for information on location some status like fuel weapon status and so on to pass between system this means it will be able to integrate with the partiots the awacs that may arrive and the electronic warfare units that have been donated so everything works in a much more coordinated fashion in western doctrine the pilot would be the lead and everything else supporting rather than having a ground controller watching a radar and trying to run the battlespace they also get data from gps organic into the weapon systems this should allow for better targeting systems can be targeted dynamically and the ew pods can feed information into the harms so once they work out the training they will be far better at sead forcing russians to turn off radars so other aircraft can make closer runs another advantage they will bring is some at least have sniper targeting pods so they will be far more able to get devastating hits in support of front line operations they may be far better at avoiding spoofing and jamming of gps but they are oldish systems so that one is not known i know even modern airliners have issues with the spoofing and jamming but perhaps they were not hardened to it or its not something turned on radar and the processing should have far better acuity if not range better target selection more able to burn through jamming so at first its going to be hitting some cruise missiles but expect the mission profiles to become more complex as the other components of the system become more used to getting feeds from and sending too the aircraft this will take time to learn unless their has been a really good training program already but as the ship numbers grow and experience and capacity is gained you should see much more western style complex multi ship opps with real sead modern ew coordinating with the patriots and if it arrives the awacs,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNUJ5SEZuRXNrSmtxOE9IdThYUjJYWURDMkU4YzU1UVRYaFAtdENhcTFKUC1qWGdVYU93SWxieWJmd0c1MGk3bzNnRXpHdFRVeFppcC1mdlBmbVUteHc9PQ==

sort of those same air to air missiles namely sidewinder and amram can both be fired from nasams air defense systems but those are only present in small numbers mobility is by far the biggest advantage from an air defense perspective a relatively small number of jets should be able to cover an absolutely massive area of ukraine and given proper notice move wherever they are needed,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSTNGVk9Gc25WdFNwYkxKS2ZCWjZqdTloMkZBbGVhNmhTVWdsRkhpb2pfV2tZNG8wVWJ3andoZDdSVklWYjBQMFVoOERMc0l4OHJLYXlTSlRqOGpIbFE9PQ==

why are there so many videos from the ukraine war showing only small squads or even a few men but nothing when it comes to larger forces are assaults not done with larger armies anymore even when im seeing vehicles its just one or two of them on their own is it because of artillery and drones or are there other reasons edit thank you all for the eyeopening replies,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUWt1RHRWVk1kb0lIUUJER3ZHNTFtV0ptQy1HbmtzWjFoRk9fWkhRdXZCYUEwQVpvMzhBYVpaeUVkU3JrYk5VSjJtLW50amRkVkdhOVNrQkR0SndsOVE9PQ==
both sides seem to lack officers at the middle level who can coordinate efforts between different squads manpower also seems to be an issue especially as russia prefers to dripfeed the army with a constant supply of men with minimal training rather than build up a larger better prepared force,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWFU3S1JxOUJrcEtFeXZ3dXB1MGpvellIT2luaWVkVVpYOUJqX1F4OUR6aDVfSWRuSEZSbjdIS1pwTm9HbHlvS0Q4eXMzbEswcTg3dmtmeU9DVFMtTUE9PQ==

i heard the first issue is because the soviet military did not rely on ncos as much as western militaries so officers had to do a lot more this trickled down to the current ua and ru militaries also i believe there were less staff officers in the ussr as well which again impacts the two exsoviet states,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaXlLQVpkOGtIVDFBcGd6LTMtNXlmMjZQWE5yaWI0MmRzNE9ZOUdNanJrcDFERy0tcVNsa3JVX1FEVDY0ekF2YnpuVTlXZ1RQbWExTXJrM2NaNWc3N1pXUjBxUklwNFZoQWNGNGxRUlVQUlk9
because massed assault are not worth it economically too many losses in manpower and equipment both sides have learned the lessons already so the default tactic by russia is pulverizing positions with artillery and glide bombs and then overwhelming demoralized ukrainian positions with small scale motorized assaults with dismounted infantry,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZFZ5LUxLUVZOempOZFVoRV9TdURvRlQ3SGxndFlYaEJkZ2d0WF9vcW50cEw3SVZ6Qm9NLUhiVHNKTmhHWlFyM3JpNi1jZjM5MjlVRUdDUHFmc25DMGc9PQ==
i would say artillery and drones are the main reason troop concentration tend to get hit very hard very quickly by precision weapons both sides learned this the hard way ukraine during their counteroffensive and russia on a much bigger scale in the first months of the war obviously training and coordination also plays a role but with observation drones everywhere concentrating forces is always very risky,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRjk4akJuSnN3VFFSb21lRjZtWTd3Nl9JNGlTR2dPaW9VQ2x0UFN4dFlSbndsVWk0RWVwM05JcXZRWExDdDExX3VNSDRueWpQQ0tsNHdCeGxjdlp0dVE9PQ==

well first as a basic point theres a heavy selection bias effect in what videos we see so its hard to conclude whats happening based on what gets posted we have to remember theres whole categories of stuff that simply isnt visible on the internet that said one of the consistent criticisms weve seen is that ukraine struggles to coordinate much beyond the platoon level their command and communication structure presents challenges for it such that neighboring units often have little to no official communication they also lack anything like the nco layer thats the get shit done spine of nato armies additionally once the kinetic initial phase of the war ended most of it is static positional warfare along a very long front dug in defenses extensive mine fields and the combination of drone spotting with artillery limits opportunities for using mass to create breakthroughs both sides have resorted to smaller scale probing in the hopes of modest gains,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSTZXb1pCd3NrTEdic3NCM0tLbUtkR3dVZXllRFBYSTkzNWRvOUFSNXJSelU1Z0dlMmthWUVMdzdkV1Z5YmVTc2FJZTN4S0FvcWNhcDBfSGx0a2FsTlE9PQ==

>why are there so many videos from the ukraine war showing only small squads or even a few men but nothing when it comes to larger forces >are assaults not done with larger armies anymore does not mean there are not attacks in other parts of the line at the same time it may be its likely to be a variation on what is called infiltration tactics these were developed in wwi near the end to over come the massed entrenchments you use small squads to hit locations preferably weak points try to over run them and then have the follow up mop up the strong points real war is nothing like the movies what we may be seeing is a phase where the troops are bussed in on apcs and ifv this is where you see the drones striking vehicles then a phase where they have been debussed and trying to storm trenches this is when you will see them on the ground running around at something what we dont see is a classic line of ifvs mixed with the troops in old school soviet style firing to support the advance or the ifvs in over watch giving it hammer to support them in the more nato style of the s it seems to be the much more <number> style of dropping them off and wishing them well from an apc and leaving them to do the storming phase on their own with a stiff upper lip and the good wishes of the senior officers the density of mines kamikaze drones and the accuracy of modern artillery and proliferation of atgms play a role lack of training may play a bigger role edited here is an old british training video on the soviets the whole video is worth a look but i have time stamped the big where the troops begin a storm with the ifvs <url><url> this is not what we are seeing i am just showing what their doctrine was we are seeing what may be a mix of infiltration tactics and the old battle bus tactics of the apcs at about <number><number> the british troops turn up and save the day by destroying a massively larger force with some vim good shooting and errrr unrealistic editing,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhaWZqdEZ6VU1aVG15cEJlYkphN2FFaS1YLUEyc21IZVVNUUc0M0tZMlM0VVV1endRZ2RhWGhkTkhNNnYwcGtqQUlobHJDRGttMUxxWXJhOURFLWJFVWc9PQ==

theres youtube channel called covert cabal thats ran by a guy who purchased commercial sats and tasks them to image russian stockpile sites then analyzes them he shows the images themselves so its a good primary source and it does in fact show that russian equipment specifically ifvs apcs and tanks are being burned through at a completely unsustainable rate obviously we cant say they have x years of supply left because usage will be throttled according to available stores but if im remembering correctly he estimated about a year and half at current consumption rates with an accompanying degradation in force quality as older and older systems must be renovated his assumptions around unserviceable systems seem reasonable as well although that will allow some wiggle room in his estimates foreign sourcing is unlikely to be a great fix to the problem as there are relatively few countries that are willing to sell to russia have enough spare afvs to sell and have recentwell maintained enough afvs to be useful theres some other sources floating around the osint space that do the same thing but none that i know of that are as transparent,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdElBWDBucTZJX0VRUElGRm9LdENlbFRQZ0hXeVNyUndhTVFjZUdTZmtwdTl0dXp2RWxJcEYyM25ieC1kck03c2pLbUc2ZEUtRVdiRkFRWVJPRDljVFE9PQ==

both the ukrainians and russians lack the capabilities to achieve breakthroughs because of this the fighting has devolved but we are also not seeing true world war i style fighting because both ukraine and russia lack the manpower to build full trench constructions and man them theres also the issue that ukraine is just huge yes artillery and drones play a role in making it once again easier to defend but that also happened during world war i it comes down to both sides being unable to break through the enemies frontlines,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhell1QTl3T2l2STVOSl9nS2IwLTdkdVQzZ3g5Vkh2QXB4V2R2SWhPN0FQNkV6MnhmSk82ZXBZNkdFMVYwbEtTbExSbWdSTkdfZUViS0NPQjVLMWNRRmc9PQ==

with tactical incompetence and having been promoted thanks to nepotism using terms like lawlessness thoughtless criminal orders and completely unnecessary losses polishchuk an internet personality best known for her nickname ptashka birdie and bravery medals given her by president volodymyr zelensky accused the th brigade commander of having ordered key senior personnel from the brigade staff to front lines to serve as infantrymen where most were killed or wounded a few weeks ago on his direct order almost the entire top intelligence of the brigade was sent to the advanced positions absolutely without any need for it as a result the intelligence chief of the brigade killed the artillery chief of one of the attached battalions killed the chief sergeant of the intelligence company killed the commander of the intelligence company woundedby these actions the commanding general destroyed the entire intelligence management unit of the brigade polishchuk claimed in a sunday facebook

military personnel including those from high leadership positions selfishness blind careerism the sacking of commanders in disagreementandinhumane and unprofessional attitude she went on to announce her group was ending ambulance and evacuation support to the brigade other ukrainian media widely covered the russian offensive towards pokrovsk and like polishchuk identified the th brigade commander by name and pointed to the town krasnohorivka as the scene of a recent bloody ukrainian defeat purportedly caused by poor leadership kyiv post was unable to contact the officer for comment about the

becoming realthe situation is critical the enemy has an advantage so lets improve at least what we can quickly change the quality of management the order and organization of our forces butusov wrote calling on syrsky to overhaul brigade leadership there was no clear official response to the journalists public appeal the medic polishchuks demand that syrsky do something about alleged chaos in th brigades senior command group and purported heavy losses of ground in krasnohorivka and defensive positions nearby came nearly two weeks after butusovs report polishchuk in other claims accused th brigade leadership of launching recently recruited troops assigned to the unit to bloody and unsuccessful attempts to regain lost ground with counterattacks although the soldiers had less than two months of training fighting the russian army by micromanagement without visiting the front line is ineffective butusov charged serhiy tsekhotsky an officer serving with the th for more than two years in comments to kyiv post rejected those claims he said the brigade and ukrainian defenses around it were not only holding their ground but inflicting crushing damage on russian personnel and combat equipment we are cutting them to pieces tsekhotsky said their losses are massive tsekhotsky said that according to official brigade counts over june men and officers from the th claimed credit for the

told kyiv post the syrskyordered inspection would find a combatcapable unit with a strong command staff and said the inspectors could conclude polishchuks allegations against the brigades senior officers were personally motivated the kremlin has called the capture of all of ukraines donetsk region a war aim and for more than eighteen months has gradually expanded control over the region using

i think claiming high casualties inflicted even if theyre true is a heavy deflection with the seemingly severe armor shortage afflicting a lot of russian units the tactic of small infantry teams being used to take ground at a slow and steady pace is almost guaranteed to create heavy losses even in successful battles the th killing large amounts of russians is not necessarily conflicting with the idea of an inept or corrupt brigade either unless im thinking of a different unit hasnt the th had allegations of corruption since the failure of the counter offensive,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhY3pZaDhiUXduNUtBQm9iajBGYUJJMkdJeWNzamw4dEIwMDZybFBEaWg1UHEzVDQwSGF1eGJFVEY0N2Vib0ZYMWRpTHdXV0xOcXpfc202enpzNm9pZEE9PQ==

youre more discussing the difference between self propelled and not self propelled rather than the difference between rocket and gun artillery either can be mounted on a vehicle in the last <number> years or rocket has been seen more as an offensive artillery system firing dozens of rockets before an attack as such it was more often found self propelled to get to the front fire then retreat gun artillery was more for sustained engagements and defensive operations hence was more often found as a towed system ukraine has shown that counter battery fire is a big threat and even defensive gun artillery needs to be mobile weve already seen a swing in procurement away from towed guns to self propelled guns,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheTZieUZZaDBVekdwOHJ0WE5vMnVTTEJWeWtuZmRyd2ZwdjVyUkVSNE5rYW9rXzllUVRVM1U5ckRJTERabjZYX1pyQTNiS0VRMmoyM2wyNEQ1QWx5aEE9PQ==
trump picks jd vance of ohio as running mate<url> >vance is a vocal critic of us military aid to ukraine in the ongoing russoukrainian war he has said it is in americas interest to accept that ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the russians vance has faced bipartisan criticism for his views on ukraine in december <number> he was criticized for calling for the suspension of further aid to ukraine because he said it would be used so its ministers can buy a bigger yacht not a surprising choice as it aligns with the populist movement within the gop and ohio will be a key battleground state in november mods feel free to delete if you think this doesnt fit here but i felt it was relevant to any long term forecasting of us aid to ukraine,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhY3BiNzBoSzdIX3lkOG5Cb0dqMHNaRnRCYVAyYUFoalhPdElqbUcyWm1lby1VU2p4RWp5RDhuNEZqSGcwM0JmMXBmbXhreURqMDJyU09RLTJHSnB3Mi1teHFhRGRFSEZUNWlsMnNSSmJFMEE9

he did a long interview with nyt<url> last month which dived into where he stands on a swathe of issues admittedly i dont pay much attention to us domestic politics but i was surprised that he articulated his populist positions with a minimum of bullshit he seems pretty wellspoken whether you agree with his positions is a different story of course of particular interest to this audience is probably his comments on ukraine > ukraine > yeah > in the opinion piece you wrote for us you were very critical of the aid that we were giving to ukraine but at the end of the piece you seemed open to the idea of supporting ukraine in a defensive posture from a certain perspective that is what the biden administration has done yes they supported two ukrainian counteroffensives one of which went well and one of which did not but relative to more hawkish voices including in your own party they have tried to avoid direct confrontation with russia so im curious what you think has been so wrong with their strategy i know you think we shouldnt have encouraged the recent counteroffensive > thats the most important divergence between me and the biden administration i thought the counteroffensive would be a disaster that we were motivated by moralism and not enough by strategic thinking the russians had really adjusted in a lot of profound ways it was extremely obvious when you talked to our military leadership in classified settings they were exceedingly skeptical that the ukrainians would achieve any strategic breakthrough ok why are we doing this then > is there a more minimalist jd vance plan that would involve limited defensive support for ukraine as part of a path to armistice > what i would like to do and what i think fundamentally is achievable here with american leadership but you never know till you have the conversation is you freeze the territorial lines somewhere close to where they are right now thats no <number> no <number> is you guarantee both kyivs independence but also its neutrality its the fundamental thing the russians have asked from the beginning im not naive here i think the russians have asked for a lot of things dishonestly but neutrality is clearly something that they see as existential for them and then three theres going to have to be some american security assistance over the long term i think those three things are certainly achievable yes > the critique of you and everyone else who opposed the recent appropriation was that if you cant demonstrate a durable commitment to ukraine then russia doesnt have any incentive to make peace if the russians think theyre winning how do you give putin an incentive to make a deal if youre cutting funding > the leverage that we have over the russians is not in my view that we can indefinitely keep the ukrainians in a successful defensive posture let me be clear about this there is no way with our capacity and what russia has been doing that we can hold off the russians indefinitely there are two big points of leverage that we have one they could take over ukraine but they cant govern ukraine were talking about multiple hundreds of thousands of troops to govern the country effectively as a russian subsidiary the second point of leverage that we have is a war economy has its own internal momentum theyre now at <number> percent of gdp being spent on defense they have reengineered an economy around fighting a war instead of around improving the lives of your people that has some real problems over the long term by the way its not in our interest either for the russians to have a war economy for the next five years because then theyre going to be more militaristic and aggressive than they otherwise would be > you agree its not in our interest right now for the russians to roll through the rest of ukraine > no it is not in our interest there is much more to the interview mostly domestic issues but also a bit on broader foreign policy > how would you describe your foreign policy perspective > not as putin first as maybe your readers would say > i asked how you would describe it > im very selfaware ross many flaws thats not one of them the term realist gets thrown around a lot and id say there are three pillars to realism in the st century the first is that moralisms about this country is good this country is bad are largely useless and we should be dealing with other countries based on whether theyre good or bad for americas interests that doesnt mean you have a complete moral blind spot but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that youre dealing with and theres a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country > no <number> is the most important lesson of world war ii that we seem to have forgotten that military power is downstream of industrial power we are still right now the worlds military superpower largely because of our industrial might from the s and s but china is a more powerful country industrially than we are which means they will have a more powerful military in <number> years > and no <number> is acknowledging that were in a multipolar world and we need allies to step up in big ways so that we can focus on east asia which is where our most significant competitor is for the next <number> or <number> years > should we defend taiwan if its attacked > our policy effectively is one of strategic ambiguity i think that we should make it as hard as possible for china to take taiwan in the first place and the honest answer is well figure out what we do if they attack the thing that we can control now is making it costly for them to invade taiwan and were not doing that because were sending all the damn weapons to ukraine and not

i dont think so the tools needed to win in ukraine have only a partial overlap with the tools needed to win in the pacific for example artillery abrams and ms arent going to matter in a pacific war while munitions like atacms will the overlap between the two causes more problems the longer the war goes on but may also drive production increases that may pay off in a pacific war looking specifically in air defense munitions as well as cruise + ballistic missiles the us would be best served if they actually gave the ukrainians the tools to win and the ability to properly use them but the rollout for certain platforms has been slow and a lift on important targeting restrictions has materialized too late or not at all,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM3NFeUJUM1FOTjRvaWdDNXk5a2xBVUlvQ25obXE4b19YSHlyd1c1RTRhNTNaVkF0d3FDZVR2V050OVJhREJXWkJPQ2dNeXNSSkRyR3pLTldQbGFIemhzQ2pBT283SWdmdFozQzVyQjlCUFU9

hes aligned with the supposed trump plan but neither of them really make sense and hinge on huge leaps getting russia to the table in the trump plan this is supposed to occur by surging weapons to ukraine if russia advances or doesnt negotiate but delivering no more aid when ukraine has too strong a position according to vance russia will come to the table because of economic concerns russia has proven itself to be completely fine with sitting the west out while losing hundreds of thousands if trump forces ukraine to fight in predictable waves especially short lived ones the russians likely wont mind waiting the west out some more on this the west has expected russia to reconsider due to economic concerns a million times by now but it never happened neutrality for ukraine how is ukraine neutral but under us protection the russians will simply look at japan or south korea to realise that even a neutral country with a strong american troop presence wont stay factually neutral ukraine on the other hand will see an administration declaring rationality a pivot to asia and no defense for freeloaders why should they believe that the us will make a long term exception in their specific case just claiming to be a realist while making major assumptions that habe no basis in reality isnt a foreign policy the unfortunate truth is weve seen this type of deal play out as designed by the great deal maker himself the afghanistan treaty trump brokered was an unmitigated desaster as was his decision to withdraw from the iran accord but as long as he gets to claim victory which his base will believe no matter what hes fine with any outcome all this grand talk about a ukraine strategy is essentially useless unless the new administration would commit to full support in the case of a negotiation breakdown which it wont do,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOG5zbkM4NWJYOXNabVhmc0pMVjVETmdNYjRPOWdzeVFFNURZdVNBemx2TmM4eEVVUHA2WklnTVJMUDZjbDFCVl9lRlBMMGhUWENhcThyOVlvcm9nTjZXZ3o2N2JJcjR2dV9QSUNyNElCY1U9

i was just circling back to this to check my analysis given subsequent events and noticed i missed your comment back when this post was live but felt it was worth pointing a couple things out i think there was a critical piece of information that you were missing because i did not state it explicitly specifically the mind boggling quantity of that captured russian equipment i mentioned > <number>+ donated sovietvariant tanks versus around <number> lost plus captured russian equipment by the last few months of the battle of bakhmut the ukrainians had captured more than <number> russian tanks mostly during the russian retreat from kyiv and the kharkiv counteroffensive thats why i took the point as fairly well substantiated i felt that the <number>+ buffer from captured equipment was more than enough to cover any under reporting even if oryx only captured <number> of total losses the ukrainians would have had almost exactly the same number of sovietderived tanks available as they started the war with around that time and that estimate would also assume none of the losses documented on oryx were repairable which seems unlikely especially in light of evidence from recent months that suggests the ukrainians actually have an extremely robust recovery and repair system for their t variant tanks i also do not think that armor availability was a fundamental premise for any of the arguments i made really i meant it merely as a smaller bit of evidence forming part of a larger more complete picture of the broader economy of force issues at play my primary point was that the ukrainians did not allocate much armor to the front around bakhmut at all despite the reports of extremely challenging conditions suggesting either an extreme deficit in equipment an intentional economy of force strategy to minimally resource the defense or both given the huge quantity of new brigades they stood up over the past two years its not surprising that armor is starting to be spread pretty thin now but that doesnt mean there is no armor in fact theres roughly the same amount of armor just spread across a larger overall force so the absence of afvs in bakhmut reflected an intentional economy of force decision rather than purely an equipment shortage just because there are not enough afvs to equip new brigades doesnt mean there arent afvs available at all so even if there were equipment shortages the decision not to allocate the limited quantity available still constituted a decision to reserve whatever afvs they did have for other purposes that in turn suggests that they were not blindly wasting resources on holding the city at any cost clearly they decided holding bakhmut was not worth losing any of their higher quality kit at all instead a lot of the better legacy kit was held back for the new assault brigades meaning the abdesignated units like the rd ab not the larger offensive corps composed of brigades equipped with western kit with the remainder concentrated in mechanized or tank brigades functioning as divisionlevel active defense reserves anchoring a sector of the front ultimately we wont really know whether it was worth fighting for bakhmut so hard for many years to come when sufficient evidence has been declassified to assess the costs in terms of the actual ukrainian and russian casualties suffered equipment destroyed and supplies expended then we will be able to evaluate the information available on the ground at that time to the relevant military and civilian decisionmakers at which time we can perhaps come to some conclusions about whether it was the right choice and whether the results were positive for ukraine which arent necessarily the same thing one can be true without the other a bad choice can have a good result and vice versa but that said i do think the decision to keep fighting was ultimately the correct one at the time the uaf leadership made a difficult politically unpalatable decision to sacrifice units that were never going to be useful in an offensive to burn through low quality russian troops primarily prisoners in stormz battalions that would have been far more useful on the defensive than they were offensively in meatwave assaults low quality light infantry are universally much more able to hold their own trenches than they are to conduct assaults squarely into the teeth of enemy trenches unfortunately despite whatever attrition the russians suffered around bakhmut they still had enough reserves to hold the line against the counteroffensive albeit when protected by a deeply layered trench system extensive ew capabilities vast yet incredibly dense minefields and ka<number> attack helicopters capable of outranging any uaf tactical antiair asset while picking off their tanks and ifvs from the comparative safety of their own operational rear a comfortable km behind the lines without the ability to overcome those threats the quality and quantity of russian reserves simply did not become decisive factors in frustrating the ukrainian offensive however stormz and other similar light infantry were at times decisive during the later stages of the counteroffensive with front line stormz units sometimes creating sufficient delay to enable elite vdv units prosecuting an elastic defense to counterattack against and frustrate a ukrainian assault meaning it did benefit the ukrainians that there were fewer low quality meatwave type units available during the counteroffensive because more such units may have prevented even the limited progress that they did make the ultimate question is whether that benefit was worth the price paid or at least whether the potential benefit made it a reasonable bet for the uaf leadership to take given what they knew at the time so whats the price paid critics of the decision to hold in bakhmut typically claim that the ammo expended and experienced troops lost compromised the subsequent counteroffensive yet when you look at the ukrainian units involved in the battle from december <number> until the russian victory in may <number> only the rd assault brigade would have conceivably participated in any offensive so only its losses really would have detracted from the forces available for the counteroffensive yet it did not experience particularly heavy losses during the defense of bakhmut at all quite the opposite the unit remained so combat effective that they were able to make impressive gains conducting spoiling attacks against the russians in the suburbs around the city during the counteroffensive which they accomplished despite being equipped with some really old legacy western kit like yprs that means the rd ab would not have been one of the tip of the spear units like the th omb with its bradleys yet it was those heavily armored and mechanized tip of the spear units which were not able to break through with breaching assaults during the counteroffensive suggesting that a more lightly equipped unit like the rd ab would have made no difference to the operations in the south anyway i certainly think its fair to at least say that its absence or casualties cant be the explanation for the counteroffensives failure there are also no suggestions that ammunition shortages doomed the counteroffensive although ammo shortages occurred well after the initial failed breaching assaults those shortages were used to justify dpicms donations and there was no meaningful disruption in ukrainian artillery fires at least not until many months later after the complications around the us aid package cropped up thus it does not seem that the ammunition expended in bakhmut detracted from the counteroffensive at all which in fact saw the ukrainians establish

yes and europe realized it by now after decades of friendly relationship with russia im pretty sure trump didnt and doesnt care about europe security he only made this a big topic to score domestically the administrations before him also called out germanyeurope for doing too lessnordstream etc etc maybe if the us wouldnt have started illegal wars which led to a few hundred k civilian casualties and dead european soldiers someone would have listened during afghanistan and iraq a lot of europeans thought the us are the bad guys lets hope the us doesnt f up again and stays on the good side of history a bit longer,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUXU4eUJjTlRlNUVrY0ZhWVdZQ2pNWDVUNzRDM2N3RTkxVEZxNFd5Y0xWMW1QcmhqNDVTdS11TFpnVzhLS3FtRDQwTjNEZmk0M19OUmZ1Sy1oRHJLbndxcTZ4VXpQaG1nbU1WQTczVTR4OXc9
while its obviously hard to trust anything coming out of russia nowadays i think the party line is that russia would accept ukraine joining the eu but not nato <url>,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVVBYamx0dHU4eEhBNWpqakVTQVBJd3NaNEVFT2c0c3EyMm1taWYzNWJRdU45M1h5MWJYZ1BFZ1lPNE5ieDNmYlNJaVpKVlYwRWJTZDliRlRZbktRdDZHcUFXTTFna3pURkRJcnZWMFQyczQ9
i think a decisive ukrainian victory makes such a scenario very likely though such a victory means moving the nato border east by a considerable margin with a likely revanchist russia angling for a lot of nato territory thats a recipe for conflict i would argue the best case scenario in terms of avoiding such a situation would be a frozen conflict after the russian soviet stockpiles have been further attrited wed have good reason not to admit ukraine into nato in such a scenario russia would be less likely to engage in revanchism and wed have a solid buffer should a conflict break out again,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0JCcktudEZKQUNmZFFadUdna1N5eWtwTzBrRWc3U2NnOWZTUjVYN0RkRGEtUE9KY3k0RzlKRTk5cEJ0WnFjNHRQaUpsb1MtTGVwdHBlRmlQMHJHVGc9PQ==
nah vance was picked because he resonates with the maga voter base is media savvy relatively smart and young enough to take over the reigns as the party leader once trump finishes his term i dont get the impression that ukraine is a core priority for trump which may actually end up being part of the problem when it comes time to negotiate with putin it could be similar to the afghanistan negotiations where he didnt really care about the geopolitical implications of the agreement as much as he did about saying he struck a deal some deal any deal thus solving the problem,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN1FUVnJ2ZWV2dm43amJOa0FRWUFDZ01pVk5tRmlZZjh4SEJVMzNpVmJKNXF1UWxfSEF1R1JWYXhrdzNBYlNsQ3VCU010MWNSY3gxR2N3QURZR2hTbmc9PQ==
i find many of these points not self evident at all they are at best possibilities in particular wether a further war is guaranteed is pure speculation most expert warning of this simultaneously qualify it on the absence of nato reaction to small provocations and not full blown war at all so in fact it is largely independent of the outcome in ukraine while assuming basically the us and another major nato countries choosing to ignore russian provocations against members i would as well doubt that international order is and was in particular good condition before the ukraine war outside europe japan south korea and north america it certainly is not seen that way,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQ1V6TFpWNlY2VnpleE5zSDNrUXNZTHVSRVY0cjBneXZPUVh0eGRWQzN2aEp5NnNTXzhBQk5lT3J2eEJ5MS0yMDRHY2dEN2N4eDFtZGs0N2lBS0ZBbmc9PQ==

>why would the us be best served by a hypothetical decisive ukrainian victory it will show potential aggressors in other parts of the world that america can fund a winnable war against them it can put worries inside the ccp circles like no matter how long it tookamerica just threw equipments to ukraine and theyve won the war against russia we thought theyll give up on them so maybe theyre actually serious in defending taiwan too america has the big stick so they can talk softly if theyre afraid of using it due to being bloodied give it to the people fighting the russians so they can beat them and humiliate them make russia an example of what happens if you defy american world order china and iran wouldnt fall in line by being soft or playing the were avoiding escalations card theyll fall in line if you use your strength not just being contend with showing it by falling in line i mean not being aggressive or theyll dial it down,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVUtQSWMwRjRLU0tmSDM0MVFuTl9hN3JnQldBNTlnNFZ4UFJ2a2RBYTdZNDk2VE9tOHpTaVJJdzZtNGtZWFI2U05zanZHMVZhb2gxbDdTSFZUQnVhZkE9PQ==
some are still taking the administrations to be more naive than they should ever get credit for that is apart from the fact it doesnt really fit with the noescalation talk that with markedly different viewpoints has been part and parcel of this subreddit just about every day if your greatest worry and purpose is preventing some kind of escalation and for better or worse youre acting like it then youre not having your head in the sand maybe there are the wrong heads in offices at the wrong time but this is something very different to be clear i wouldnt just deem washington and berlin in particular indifferent or oblivious they are wrong terribly historically wrong and have been from the first day on and theyre not making bones about their priorities which is about the oddest thing to me are people just not listening washington and berlin in particular do not want putin to fail presumably in part because theyre convinced russia would fail i can think of further reasons though if one wouldnt believe this now in spite of the objective realities of thearguably regainedstability of putins regime alone theres nothing else to do at the same time of course no one wants ukraine to fail either or perhaps i should say more cautiously can afford to let this happen but frankly i think this is more about prestige global posturing and reluctant consideration for allies in northern and eastern europe than about true sympathies towards kyiv either way the upshot of such schizophrenia being what we see and hardly surprising so a complete disaster i fully support what another user said about all in or all out eating your cake and having it too wont do more specifically and aware of what all out would entail i for one was always opting for all in but to me that is intervention and could only be not add this or that munition to the aid package and see what happens there were not many besides me and now guess what its too late its spilled milk and well have to see what another us leadership can possibly make of it wouldnt even have to be worse than the disaster left behind by those who came before and there goes another ultracheap win for the hard and populist right a poachers goal even that too stopped surprising me some time ago just one more thing for those who missed the missing invitation at the latest summit even socialdemocratic berlin and democratic washington are actively striving lobbying against ukrainian nato membership already so at least for that it doesnt need trumpvance and if this is what russia wants it is these three parties might as well be talking by this time again wouldnt be surprised if deep down they had already hoped for some kind of change of power not in moscow but in kyiv rather things could be so easy,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRzdBZFU5Q3FaQ0lNNGg2Ynpac0FNbUFEckRNS0dYZ01DMFhtZzBobllQY1F5a3FzSTBuX1B3UVFXSUNrWTBOZzFibGRJRzdwRkRkNFAtNE9rYW8yMEtpZi1LampTcGRNa3JzVVpFVHFHcTA9
