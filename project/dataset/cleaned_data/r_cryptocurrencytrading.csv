you talking about leverage trading up to x on perpetuals btw while op talking about taking a loan that he can spend on what ever he wants while using bitcoin as collateral but its easy op people do it because they want to save their btc hoping for a major increase and not paying as much in interest,r/cryptocurrencytrading,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVkdwd2psaDFwV010YWp4Sk1HZmRlX3dMMVBTbGd5anFJejVoYWEzcEVvWDFXakIteFJBcUFhcE1ReEVzYndOZThFa25LR3RDN2I1b1RwZVJXcWRFQnc9PQ==
lol yea <number> to <number> on collateralized loans where i would pretty sure x at the low low he must be only looking at dex where funds arent locked onto platform during the loan ofc those be less than <number> to <number> and best use case for those is doing it to double up a long on something deposit k usdt borrow k btc swap,r/cryptocurrencytrading,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVTRQaTdPYklyR25ZdXVtTWxrNHJ1dk1OY1VvT29TV01CMjNjREdSeDNBOVMzRFF4M1N3bU5adXVWQmI5anZXRjZPWm5MVGdoWnB4MGRnTi03WUZtNEE9PQ==

sure that is a easy fix many platform probably have that but its not what op is talking about but a regular loan like bank loan but you use crypto as collateral was thinking about x long when the bull run starts but bitcoin only need to drop <number> to lose all your btc but they probably liquidat your position around <number> haha im still thinking on a x long during the bull market though,r/cryptocurrencytrading,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdm9VUUlPU2IyNHA4UGJDSm1JS3pCd2hJazk5czhaLUdWUXVLNHhCVjlWajZ4YlBIa3dEMU5YNXdLd1hLNzhLeWtBcXN2Y1NkVUxhVWRKWFBQOTZmc1E9PQ==
yea yea understood and you dont start as x long how u make that play is with a <number>x leverage to start and as its profiting you increase leverage and the size piece at a time thats how you end up doing like x riding a huge long and it definitely can work easily if youve been watching how its moving can get that bottom within like <number> ish thats actually true value in platforms that offer crazy x x leverage not for the initial but to really ramp it up after your already green,r/cryptocurrencytrading,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTb29QbEhwVGkxbVFjUlFjdGVuNC05S2R2dENtRzB2MUkyeVRzMWpHWnpiY0plZ2k2MV9sYlZCbFJNLXVwWkN2d2xkSnN5Uk0yS19GWjNCS2dfaU81bmc9PQ==

yea yea im just saying you start with that <number>x and only add moneyleverage to it as your profiting you wanna ride a long from what you think is the super low point for a week or more this is the way like thats how start a trade that ends up massive with very little risk if your wrong and the bottom is lower close out partialall of it and find a new entrance or at least do not add anything to it catching knives down attempting an entrance at x + leverage is pretty much diving headfirst into a wall for most people or will end up that within a few trades even if your first one does get lucky,r/cryptocurrencytrading,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZHRneS1VMlFFanJ3aC0zY0JkcDB1U3RhOTc0UzM3c0ZFMFhTY3ZaYWV3MHYxNkQ1ZFkyN0s1NXhqdlJBMzdrZjJKckdvQk5Wb3NSdWplVWlhMW1ycnc9PQ==
