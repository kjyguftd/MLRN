whiteboardcrypto for basic terms coinmarketcap is your crypto tracker nothing in crypto is as straightforward and simple as a brokerage account bianance offers a person plenty to choose from already trying to get stuff on a dex and then where to put it is a mountain of added complexity stick to the shallow waters yet there are plenty of great projects on binance to make you a boatload of money without jumping into the total degeneracy of microcap tokens and especially stupid meme coins funny enough a background in banking is actually going to make crypto more difficult a lot like being really good at tennis and jumping into a game of racquetball,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVFAwUldzQVFSTXMxRWYzUzMzRmloUGZlZHpiS2d4RlZkNFBMM0xUcFdic3ZDSFNCMWk4TzhqYm94bWs0Yk5jdUlIbHgwamhyYjV3UkRaNURuejRVUHc9PQ==

i think ai is unfit to perform analysis in an unbiased way dyor literally means do your own research asking an ai to do it for you defeats the whole purpose and the feedback will most likely be just bad or inaccurate,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTjRRd3ZpYngzUTNRSWdQRENFUWJpWXpEMU5OU3V4aFhPbDFOOWFWX1NfOFV0UkFLOGVtVVNERTZZZnNKMmFaMEM3Ny1sU0ZmZmFjT3lpVjN2NGZLbVFPR0piMi1CYjVIcjJHcEFSQkZTbEU9

the intent behind using ai in this context is to provide a tool for an initial breakdown of the whitepapers contents acting as a starting point for individual research ai can offer a structured summary and highlight key points which can be particularly useful for those new to solana or pressed for time this is an early stage of a model that is far from perfection by sharing it now we hope to gather feedback and improve it with the help of the community limiting the ai strictly to the supplied knowledge in part <number> aims to minimize biases but its crucial to do your own indepth research and not rely solely on ai the part <number> kinda goes crazy blending an external knowledge into the context to help with understanding even further,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRWZyMVJqRk9vTUt6S0NvSmZfdnBFSkUxckE2ejJiNUZkLW5tdk5UQzRIYWVsWWJ3RHVpQ3dYeUxrV1o5RUF1eml3aWlNQ2hQNm1QdFp3bGNUR1ZENGc9PQ==

well youre probably referring to how fvgs work the way to challenge your questioning is to look at charts of successful runners do they always fill their fair value gaps im not even talking about just crypto for that matter sometimes this is when fundamentals and other ta tools will help your bias its good to stick to a strategy and not fomo in however it could very well be only up from here could also not best thing to do is look at it from different perspectives especially when you can realize you might be wrong not you specifically,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcjBoQlBMQWl6Njl2Mi1DR1c4bHpPRnpkODdOLWFrSFVKZmJpR19USG5jaHRWal9ILU1WOEt3Ql8zWVZiVmZ0WHlVZnFmTGZrbnBlbnlJaC1tdUFSbmc9PQ==

where do you get your best info if your blackpilled when you listen to people talking about crypto as if its in a vaccum i eyes roll into the back of my head ive found very little people understanding the power structure socioeconomic implications and history of governments and the power that fractional reserve banking gives this country and the world power structure being that any alternative that keeps people from parking their money in the bank where they can lend out <number> of your money and make money off that money is an extreme threat to them and their survival of course they do not want crypto to succeed without them being able to adopt it and roll it into a cbdc then they will ban cash no holding money income or tax evasion not only that they can then roll in a social credit score based on what you buy since everything can be tracked whatever the enemy of the day is now it seems to be meat so had too much steak this week its bad for the environment they lower your social credit score anyone who doesnt understand that is remiss when they talk about crypto in any sense i need to find someone or a source of information that takes that into account only then can i rely on their advice because this is coming and understanding that it is automatically gets rid of a lot of picks people have,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUQjFfV1A5NnBRNmZOeThIVHdwZFduRVlCNk9pbUFTbHV5YjVIaGhYQ01BNkJ5TzczWnBQTEZqWUtfc2ltWWgyd2lCNjBIOTR1NlRUU0pZYnRaV1l4aFE9PQ==

you dont need any advice from any crypto influencers that happen to share your view of the world its as simple as finding those that are out there looking into different alternatives coins and presenting a use case then you watch their synopsis of each crypto and make a quick decision for yourself whether its worth learning about any further or whether or not the project clashes with what you believe the future will look like like yourself i despise the idea of a social credit system and i want to limit governmental overreach as much as possible i gravitated to projects like bitcoin and kaspa because they are both decentralized no one entity can control them and they are the only assets that i have that no government bad actor could ever take from me if i did not want them to be taken there is incredible power in that especially if our governments take a turn in the authoritarian direction you and i are predicting i do not need a guru that happens to believe the same way to tell me what makes a good investment then i simply look for crypto content about new projects and ask myself what utility does this offer the world could it be done just as well without using cryptography and is this project decentralized which is in my opinion the whole strong use case for technologies like the blockchain in almost all cases the answer is that the project is not worth investing in at all,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUOEVKQmRrdFYzcWNOZTdOYnNCc0x5S2I0LW5rUmx0MTRLU0wtWkcxVUVLYmEwQ3Nqbl85ZnZ6aWJ2anB4S2ZqVkRrOG5yNEZNZkx0RWVQNHdrZDF0Yk5FZkdFaldLV1pFOGNOeWpRMUk1d2s9

what i have learned about alpha real true alpha is that its pretty rare to find on your own and theres rare specific conditions where someone will share it with you usually the size of an alpha is too small for a large account to share and accomodate lots of traders so someone like miles for example who has a large portfolio and also lots of discord members wont usually have enough alpha to go around hell synthesize some research for you and thats what you are paying for if he was willing to not fully exploite a real alpha just for himself either bec the size of the opportunity was large enough for many or bec he felt responsible bec of the paid group fee and to share with the group you would see the opportunity get pumped en masse through the rush to get in a small account is more likely to share alpha why because they dont have enough money to fully exploite it when they find it and take on so much risk also theyre less confident because they havent made it yet and want other peoples confirmation and validation so theres a window of opportunity where they got in to something and theres still opportunity for others to follow them in before it blows up to the public im speaking from direct experience i called a specific token that i tracked for months its now blowing up and i didnt fully exploite the alpha for myself i shared it for some of the reasons above that said some of those large discords are good for when sentiment gets extreme if for example they encourage you to have the guts to bet on safe investments like high caps btc eth sol etc when if you were on your own you wld be panicking last year if someone was encouraging you to bet on btc etc then they may deserve to be listened to personally i dont participate in those groups myself i am in some small telegrams with friends which also has its downsides bec yes theres occasionally alpha shared but people also engage in alpha share load balancing i just made this up basically what i mean is they feel like i made you money on some particular opportunity so i have the right to shill you into supporting my other bags people have an equation in their minds regarding their give and take with you that never matches your own perspective on your position in the relationship so you can always lose money ultimately trust nobody do your due diligence in everything if you strike gold hit it hard if youre uncertain then scale in with caution,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVdm43cm44ZE9DbDRwMVY4b3ZSSExwVFRyclZBbmU4SkdReXQzZ3MtR3BQSXptNTNYQVctN2xYMFJJejFhLVVFclJJZDBWNmxFTGpCelZ0YnZ2XzZOWW55RFE5NUdVSVgtWExEV0dGcFZxc289

i feel like you answered your own question its unpredictable therefore youre just betting on a line going up or down largely at random if not technically random then at least in a way that cant be predicted so its a bit like betting on the spin of a wheel if youre making money its presumably because youve caught a rising market and probably would have made a better return just by buying and holding the fees alone make this very hard to make a profit even if you make the right bets hey ive been there it took me a lot of time and effort to realise that the same time and effort could be spent on doing something that actually gives me a return you know like working on my career its funny how much work people put into this only to make very meagre returns i used to do affiliate marketing sites in my spare time and would happily make k a year doing bullshit blogposts a few evenings a week if youre not beating that then why waste your time maybe if you have large starting capital its easier to get meaningful wins but if i had a <cur>m to invest id just put it somewhere safe and enjoy the <cur>k interest it paid me each year no need to be greedy for every winner there are many losers and i cant risk losing my money i worked too hard for it fortunately inflation is back under control here in the uk so no need to panic on that front either,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVdksxTURIYkpjQXVINFY3Y0ZvX3VUVFlfNTltdzhtMkcwYzI5OUlKRnF1NFZ5anFQSHFGUEJUSjFERWpaTmtEeG1LcVVQX3JLRVMyWk5pZmtCTk9zNnc9PQ==

crypto is only about the price you buy and the price you sell any given coin doesnt necessarily generate wealth over time so doesnt necessarily go up in value by right asset do you mean a wealth generating asset because then time does matter time means more wealth bitcoins price is a function of buyer interest that can go up in time it can go down in time the only thing that matters is selling when there is high interest and you can never know when that peak is we hope its in the future but it could already be in the past this is fundamentally different to a wealth generating asset i bought a stock ten years ago that pays me ten percent so i already have my money back i will patiently accept the continued payouts for the rest of my life until i die or the company does i could hold my bitcoin until i retire in my s this is likely when a large community of crypto buyers will also start switching their buys to sells patience and time means nothing if there arent enough buyers to support that price we all want to sell and the price drops perhaps plummets if everyone starts to panic could really ruin our plans i dont think that will happen i just use it to point out the difference in asset class,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVM3FvdEt5N3pWMEN1cTVCSUxOa0F0QkJ0SjNvYWFteWU0SktrS0ZQTWR1c1pESjcyRmRQeHZDMF9Objl6cGU0WHFXTjI0bjFMMXJjQjFWLVhJajZOMWc9PQ==

your <cur><number>k profit might feel small over two years but honestly any profit is better than losses playing it safe can seem slow but it does have its perks over the years ive found that spreading out investments and not going allin on one coin helps balance the risk dumping a load into bitcoin and coming back in <number> years sounds like a good plan for me btcs longterm growth has been pretty good and its less risky compared to newer more volatile coins but before you go all in id suggest checking out some resources to improve your strategy the traders union page has always been a lifesaver for me theyve got tons of info on how to make smarter trades and avoid common mistakes which has helped me avoid some costly errors plus traders union reviews on different brokers can save you from pumpanddump hype its like having a free guide for crypto trading another thing ive learned is to take profits along the way dont wait for the ultimate high if you see a decent gain take some off the table its tempting to chase the next big pump but thats where a lot of us get caught out,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVU0t1OVV4QWR3TmVEdnRTQ0tpOHU4SHZtbTVjbmhnZGFNY1ZoOUw0cVQ3QU9yejBrNTZGRW9yOXhTZVFvQ1pnTG9aNGRxTGhvV3hnemNub09lZWx6NEE9PQ==

i would first encourage you to think of alt coins as not one big entity but instead as a variety of types of assets as an example meme coins like dogecoin pepe and dogwifhat people like to buy into them because they happen to be popular at this exact moment and not because they have any actual utility on the other hand coins like kaspa render solana etc actually have technology behind them that could change the way cryptocurrencies integrate into our daily lives so are alt coins worth investing in my opinion is that yes they absolutely are but i also feel very strongly that you should build your own conviction in what youre actually buying by learning more about the cryptocurrency space before you spend any of your money on any of the assets available,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWS285UlQtLU9YOHJKSXJMNzF2UExsdWl5cWpSYkFtaGdtQm85WnBjdTAxNDZ4RW8yWDczWnF3RDBTTmRUdk1sOHRKbGQ1d3BBS3E4MkNRcFdjXzNsci13emRNUEJqN0VFZ0ZhMTRheDJxN1U9

the only alt with reliable returns is eth especially after the etf news then there is a sliding scale of riskreward that applies to all the others so yes there are good returns to be found but also risks the least risky are the main chains like solana or avalanche etc and then the next risky are the tokens created on those chains which have an actual use case and are open source and used by developers in dapps or gaming etc then the most risky are the tokens created with no utility including the tokens with pretend utility and include meme coins which are the most risky,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWSW5vOW9FdkN5RzM3eHdDZFhkQWdUMFRGUHozd0lvRWlfWTJmOGZtS3RWNmFXQWJUM3BVM2FGZTE5WkI4NE4wM3lkemY5Z2FPNmNFT3RDbU5oRHFSdFE9PQ==

some rules ive set for myself when investing in cryptocurrencies do your own research dyor thoroughly research any coin or project before investing understand its purpose technology team and market potential diversify dont put all your funds into a single cryptocurrency spread your investments across different coins and projects to mitigate risk set clear goals define your investment goals and strategy whether its shortterm trading or longterm holding stick to these goals to avoid impulsive decisions risk management only invest what you can afford to lose cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and theres always a risk of losing your investment use stoploss orders protect your investments by setting stoploss orders to automatically sell if the price drops to a certain level secure your investments use hardware wallets or other secure methods to store your cryptocurrencies avoid leaving large amounts on exchanges stay updated keep up with news and developments in the crypto space regulatory changes technological advancements and market sentiment can all impact prices avoid fomo and fud dont make decisions based on fear of missing out fomo or fear uncertainty and doubt fud stick to your research and strategy take profits regularly take profits to lock in gains dont be too greedy set profit targets and sell portions of your holdings when these targets are met be patient the crypto market can be extremely volatile be prepared for ups and downs and avoid making hasty decisions during market swings good luck,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWSDI5NExrZlZOcTBfcHJobFdoQlc4OTRFSWVVcWpJVjVBSG5ST00zT3lFOTVrZlFFenVBanNVVHBPOG1IWXJhMGFGZkZNTUxJaEhxckoyMVZvWXhyREE9PQ==

on chain forensics is not particularly hard think about it in the context of bitcoin imagine you and a friend went out for coffee but you forgot your wallet perhaps your friend pays for your coffee and you decided to compensate them by sending some bitcoin directly to reimburse them when they receive the bitcoin they would have your public key which would allow them to see not only how much they sent you but how much btc you have in your wallet right now and they would be able to trace any transaction you have ever made from that wallet thus you can see the importance of privacy layer s or privacyfocused altcoins a governmentdeveloped and endorsed cbdc could very well be used for financial surveillance and credit tracking f that man,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWUEItdUxEMk5IREVsU0hCTDBva2IydjVfd3lkdEl5MEFTdjdGN1BfREotR1d2TGN1UndESl94dVZ4QmtaYUV5aEppY3JfVFpEVUZJZTNoWk1DWExZTktjdWRHTzVleDNlNVhhejVfVGV6SWs9

i made some nice gains on certain altcoin picks over the last year but one thing ive learned is you can lose money buying into overhyped coins that end up being scams with this you have to do a ton of research and not just buy into whatever coin is suggested in this forum i like using sites like traders union to learn about different altcoin projects on the good side they break down the tech the team the roadmap etc in a way that cuts through the marketing hype a couple of altcoins im pretty bullish on right now are ethereum because of its potential for nftsdefi and algorand because of its strong developer community and focus on realworld blockchain use cases for finance but id avoid getting too deep into meme coins or brandnew launches unless you truly understand what theyre trying to do stick to altcoins with clear use cases solid development teams and active communities it is given that alt coins are a high risk high reward game you could make a fortune if you get in early on the next ethereum but a lot of them are just speculative gambles with little realworld utility,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiOVk1WHZ4bGVZUDVHUzVqYVFIcnJLYTB1dzlkbjRzQnRLOUFiTm1zYTNzZHNxT0hpN1ZOcGZpeERGOTdIOWJic19Pa1h5c3BaS3dRT0RpeUltVTJ3TkE9PQ==

as for strategies when buying an altcoin most try to look at a mix of factors rather than just going in blind market cap is a popular metric here youll see more volatility but also more potential upside with lower market cap coins checking how long the project has been around and analyzing the core teams backgrounds can give you a sense of trust too maybe most importantly though id recommend looking into the community around a coin before investing are there active discussions happening how strong is the holder base just remember that strong communities with good backing can help drive longterm support if youre looking for a good resource on building an investment strategy make sure to see articles on the traders union website theyve got guides focused on helping you develop a purchasing plan that aligns with your risk tolerance still no matter your experience none of us can control the wild crypto market but doing your research on coins and having a defined strategy can hopefully help take some of the emotion and recklessness out of your buys investing more than you can afford definitely adds a ton of unnecessary stress maybe start small while you get your process dialed in,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiRGFiRGVsLUgwXzAyM3FnWjNDUmRmZThTdnYyQ2hyVnVfcnFJeDJCQ0YxWWZxbXQwRGdGVGtCWW9WX0EzWHRVVXg3di1mRDItM2pjck1lVmN5QTQyU0E9PQ==

ok thanks those arent too dissimilar to what i am already thinking although im hoping to stick more to certain amounts on certain dates as long as the price falls within predetermined amounts but still working out what those dates and amounts will be may hold some selling increments back until start of q as well even though i know that might backfire i want to sell some to cash in and some with a plan to simply hold the money and reinvest if the numbers fall low enough later but that if it doesnt fall enough thats fine anyway as i have still kept more than half of my investments in place thanks your comment was helpful,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJibEljOHRGOW03YWtWUEFWNGNldk10OHIzTy1SS0RFaVRuVEZmcmlPdzk3VGpQQVlhcGhTemhqZ1JEMDUxMFFGZUVYams5NWVIN2d1TmxaNFdNMkZxc0E9PQ==

currently my plan is to sell <number><number> spread between mid q of this year and early q of next some of the money i pull off the table i will keep and use some in offset account some towards a new vehicle just lifestyle stuff some of what i pull out will also sit in offset account but will be waiting to be deployed if the price drops low enough still working out exactly what dates and what percentage per date also what price i need the coins to be worth at each selling point before its worth selling because if doesnt reach the value i fully expect it to at a certain point im better off just hanging onto it i only have <number> net worth invested was much less but its grown to <number> so if i cannot touch the money its ok but at the same time id like to take some off it makes sense to do so it feels better because then if the downswing never happens im happy because the value of what im holding keeps going up and if it falls away after i sell im happy because then i can look at buying back to the same position i am holding now but at a discount the only way this ends up bad for me is if it goes down before i get a chance to sell some but i will not consider selling anything before december or so if it crashes i will not react just wait for the upswing even if thats years later,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiZkdSNjg0TnpLYXZhUjEzWkdLTHlrelZPcXhuTi1JTGFzOU4tNVRpWEw5c1k2ckhDTGlzV3BRUVR6MnZ3UUY0NWpSZDI5TllXd1E2SzlpQ3hoT0NJYUE9PQ==

personally i prefer to stick with the big coins i have btc eth and sol im sure some meme coins will out perform this cycle but just so hard to pick the winners if you bet early you get the best return but also the best chance of a zero return and if you wait until one is high you dont know if youre buying the peak or a digital asset that can still x from that point i dunno i think ill stick with the big three as i think theres a decent chance they x or better this cycle anyway and btc in particular is just so likely to keep running up well into the future as well,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZXJVXzJ3d0xMV0VoekFtMUZBMndNX0pwajNXMmo0ZXhXUHozSDZwa1NxS1pJZG9fWVk4d2dnWjEwVkJtM245UDhDX05mcFRxZlJCLWZaVldZalllRHc9PQ==

bitcoin if youre looking for a solid option for longterm hodling just keep dcaing into it eth party because it holds merit and then also because of the recent etf approval so if you invest keep hodling it even if the price does not shoot up immediately other good options to diversify your portfolio are sol link dot ada and other altcoins if youre more of a risk taker you can also consider pepe doge and shib and add them to your portfolio but make sure to create a balanced portfolio to minimize your risk as much as possible,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSXB1Q2R3Z21mNDRRaHRXcGVUaVJNU1RiMWF5cHp3Q0s4emcwUUotNHdlTFlxTWxJR2o5X25NSmJCMXc0a1lhbDlkdVRIRDRhVWZYdXZ5ai15bE1DczNCaVM1ZFF5SmVZV0RBcDBaaWRhWmM9

just some information off the bat do not invest blindly or give in to fomo or emotional investing start dcaing into bitcoin and keep hodling your investment consider eth and sol as safer good options diversify your portfolio with other altcoins like link dot ada ltc bnb and more diversification will essentially help you divide your losses so if one coin underperforms the others can offset that loss once you have gotten the hang of the market and done thorough research and have some extra money to experiment with you can look into meme coins like doge shib and pepe but do not go all in on meme coins as they are the riskiest crypto investments and are more often than not not worth the risk do not listen to influencers getting paid to promote specific coins you can read my blog for regular weekly posts and information geared toward crypto newbies <url><url>,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkMUQyV3Z0SlVhanA2YnpiODNTOGlrQ21tajRPdjMwZ3diRUtyMVcxM0I1LXo4UmhjYU54cU5oQ0xCWmNxQzVnTWZHNFVQUWJ5eTRtZjFnbWFfUDVCMmtSWkNhclBCdFlYaG85Nm1SZzc2M3c9

in the uk no one can access binance its simply not authorized by binance to uk residents tor doesnt even help get around it try both cocalcola pepsi or mercedes vs bmw ie get both coinbase and kraken but only use the pro side of each yes you can swap on the retail side of both but you get extra burned by the commission bad conversion ratio now to have both kraken coinbase super legitimize you get your bank account linked up with both then check what are the transfer in or out limits of cashfiat money and redemptions etc however the point is if you are opening <number> exchange that day you may as well apply simultaneously for the other and then compare one to the other also trade with same quantity of coinstokens on <number> exchange and the other do <number><number> and keep comparing once you have access to both exchangesits good there is more volume on coinbase i noticed which means maybe the buysell at market happen quicker look at coinmarketcap on the coinstokens you want buy to see which exchange has the biggest percentage of volumetransactions nb am keen to open a binance account as apparently commissions are even lowerbut i will wait until binance is officially able to operate in the uk the point isopen as many exchange accounts if you want with kycaml done by the exchangebut never ever trust their wallets and shift your coins tokens back to your cold wallet if you plan to keep long term there are no fees to keep an empty walletaccount on kraken coinbase last point i would personally never open any exchange account where they dont want to do kyc or aml because the coinstokens that you buy on that exchange may be from questionabledodgy sources that can also be comingled with the rest of your clean coinstokens bought on proper exchanges and kraken or coinbase may have the tools to see you got some bad tokens that are blacklisted and so your whole account then gets stuck for an investigation this is why im also worried that the few times i did changelly based in hong kong the coins that i got werent teinted and to this day when ive transferred them into kraken or coinbase i havent been locked out maybe the amount quantity was too small but who knows,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkcUp3Sk5oTDN6d2ZaSW9RNnVnSEVzNEthLWFXSmhUcjBSQzh1dmNTX1RsMlRYaFZoSVJ4bEQyZkRhUFhoRnduOU9oZ0tpaDFEaVlRZjZCWFlRQ21mT3FNblhPR2V3LV90RnNWRExTOExSb289
theres a very high chance you have lost that crypto if coinbase does accept bnb network in the future you might get lucky coinbase is not the best when it comes to issues like this i dont think that asset recovery is going to do anything for you but i would certainly adjust that option to be certain im sure you now know you have to be very careful with sending crypto to your wallet transferring from one wallet to another and basically everything you do with crypto mainly because there is very little point of contact with these wallets and exchanges and if you f up its hard to get it fixed im just letting you know your situation i have made errors with crypto as well its an evolving process dont expect much help from coinbase or metamask id be surprised if you got any help usually its just sorry sir but there is nothing we can do good luck,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdzU4TXNKUGFjZkhmZnFYbW5vUkJrckNOVWpQQVY5bEo2bEpOOG9pRDdBZ3hCQWZOUkhUTDVaSEhxeVNFa1dtV2Y3QWM2ZXloSkNremEtX3pSX01HQWE5OWxrZEJSQTZWRWhha1FGY3k4c3c9

im confident it will play out very similarly to the last bull run in early <number> dogecoin trended with btc and eth hit its all time high i only had a small portion of my net worth tied to the crypto market but i was watching the ongoing discussion here on reddit and on twitter in may <number> the crypto market hit the top of its first of the two big upward pushes and the bottom fell out for doge there were a few people that publicly said they took their profits but the vast majority of people were talking about how it was just a short term stumble and doge to the moon but it didnt go to the moon it just started dipping more and more and more and all of the scared bagholders turned to angry bagholders as btc and eth reversed course and went on to make their ultimate cycle top alltime highs while doge continued to drop now why do i think doge failed to rebound because people knew all along that its actually a dog s coin that has a cute dog graphic on it thats exactly what pepe and turbo are useless cryptos that are going to have their bottom drop out probably whenever the market hits its first significant resistance and stumbles as for btc and eth their all time highs were only a day apart from each other in the last run i expect they will trend together throughout the whole thing especially with etf money helping drive the ship for both of them,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbFNWbmhNUEZBX2lzSVgwTml2X3g0T2JpZGRsVVBRRXVTMVh2Zm1fc0FoTFo0OXRsLUdCRUVoMHRQWnJsR195bjJyeno3ckppbUVIbGY1bnBnbEw5emE1U2UtRHFJczRvOWNxNGx2NEhvOTg9

yeah will be interesting to see i personally dont have any of the shit coins i have some btc and eth from mid <number> which has grown but i have never added to or sold and some sol which is much smaller but bought more recently i am planning to offload some maybe <number><number> depending on factors during this bull run and then buy back into the market when it dips hard to do right so trying to learn as much as i can i have some guide numbers in mind already and some exit strategy models which i have come up with already but i think i will be very active for the next <number><number> months to identify any changes and adjust all my expectations as we go so i guess from this youre saying that if pepe and bonk are still surging that we probably have not reached our peak in btc and eth yet but that once they crash we may still go up but the crash also could be coming,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdlNrcjFxbDQ4NTgtNGdIQWI4VFVRZ3kyWWRsSUNVY29GUFJwcFNvblNVeDd6N3lLUUJhN2NJQkRyOGdQNm5kSmFtNnBzYi1wcUk0S3g0WllMeENIUlE9PQ==
your best bet is to contact coinbase support directly on their website there is a chance that maybe they can recover it for you i made a similar mistake with an altcoin on binance years ago please be sure to use the coinbase official website or official app to contact support im not sure if coinbase will do this but binance charged me a fee to recover my funds years ago,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkUkMzajZKOVJ2SWpYWi1TUGFZZVU5LXJlYnFfN2RtTVlGN3Zqem4wLVhfM3BzVkxoQ1VoQm84eXE3RWdhOFUzSEIwc25aN3JPYlBFWEZVYnljeHRYUHc9PQ==
theres no guarantee that this bull run will happen just like the last one but the divergence of btc and eth and perhaps sol in direction from the direction of the more risky coins will be a sign to watch to validate that the bull run is running out of steam it will be one of a handful of indicators im watching for this cycle,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbmNsT0tyV015SVVFVkg0by1qRmJXOGh3c2VKbWlLeTFlNnJQX1FXX21yclN6WHFvOWJjeGlJdUVuRmpRdW1UdXBIUnFtaGRSUEhMQU5aaFRwQS1KWG1yTk1jWjdadldnZHZHY0ZUUDdJRlk9

for a new investor in the crypto space the biggest advice i would give is to do some research on whatever you are planning to invest in there is a lot of crypto out there that has some amazing technology behind it and even more memecoins that dont provide any true utility the memecoins may pump for a while but eventually the tokens with true utility will be the ones that keep increasing in value and stand the test of time wellknown tokens such as btc and eth are always a good bet for investors just dont expect any of the amazing <number>x returns in these anytime soon as they already have a high market cap the project im moat invested in myself at the moment is zypto it has a low market cap at the moment with huge growth potential zypto has a real company behind it who have created their own revolutionary payment systems to help business integrate the ability to accept crypto payments directly for goods and services they also have virtual and physical crypto cards which you can use like a debit card at most retailers to purchase goods and services with your cryptocurrencies and to round it all out they have just launched the new zypto app which is an all in one wallet app where you can swap crypto hold it in a secure wallet buy crypto cards and earn rewarda in the form of zyps which rewards holders of the zypto token and those that complete tasks zyps can then be redeemed for crypto or other products and services definitely check out the website and read the white paper as i said earlier though do your own research on any potential investment in the space join project telegram chats and engage with the community to learn more before investing good luck with your crypto journey and i wish you all the best,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTTJfWGsxeWRKcWJULWlrLXoxMUdGdG8tX19MVTFPek9ldjYtODRKem1QYWdEM0tpN2RYeUFqaGxBNGJlOUkzNUVSdUdBRkJ5ZG9aOTJuSDNLQjZrN3c9PQ==

you must dyor about what to invest in i recommend to check these two projects that i never regret buying <cur>ocean and <cur>pica ocean protocol which is my favorite ai project will bring enormous changes to societies in the near future it creates something like a pp market where the main asset is data im also staking my <cur>pica this defi coin is a game changer for people involved in defi activities it was recently deployed on solana so its now natively accessible on cosmos solana ethereum and polkadot,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkVi1sWjExZW9sSTNuWk1PQmN1dzh5WWI2Zm9HUWRxOUZyR2gwZFFSMVB5MkI1eUZkaWE1T0g3X3R4Ti1YbnppaS1KLXJfaXdTRnVmTmh5QmZLWkFIY2lCUUZBRzhzR3U1N0JieXhGbENLeFU9

my advice to you is to always dyor on any project before investing in but make sure to start with ai projects because they are trending nowadays i have my eyes on rivalzai its quite impressive they are creating a decentralized ai intel layer on web with an emphasis on privacy and trust the best thing is that they have an incentive testnet up and running on galxe right now where you can contribute to the network and earn points and <cur>riz tokens,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkOU9Udkt3QTJzb19NaVRYX1E0a3paNWlDOTdxRG9odk1mSXVPY29aRVBVcjBKUlV1R20zd3d6aEFJNEJmampZclhYbGpULWU4ampJZjEyclU4YWRud2dnUDdKR0ozdWRuX1ZndF9LLUJHOWc9

i would say <cur>zypto is extremely slept on at the moment but they just released their app huge marketing push is about to start and eth etfs are going to push it well beyond m marketcap in the near future if youre looking for a solid low marketcap investment that you can hold for a while i definitely recommend looking into them i think it has the most potential of becoming a <cur><number> billion+ level marketcap out of all of the low marketcap coins sure you could get lucky with a memecoin but not worth the risk imo like i said before this project is solid and has great utility the app is great and has a <number> star rating on the play store with over k downloads in the first week it just launched last tuesday on android and will be launching on apple store soon plus just by holding <cur>zypto you earn zyps which can be redeemed for crypto so you get rewarded just for holding which is really nice,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkU2RyVDFDZmpHZGR0ZlJQZFI5b0ZjMmNJTzVwbUJ4ZVpxV09KUnZpY2R3MVpjb0xLSng5QWpHRmhUYWc4OTZyVUZHaDRNTllVcEY5Y09LaEpBWHFMaHdqOXktaUhBZFlmaUJwbGwyN05MZjQ9
also if you look at their ratings on the app store you will see they were all created by a chinese bot they dont even make any sense what the bots wrote this is definitely a very elaborate scam looks to me like people are just playing a video game thinking their trading coins they will keep paying out here and there for a few months then once theyve collected millions of dollars into their so cold exchange poofeverything will disappear the app will disappear and a bunch of suckers will be out millions of dollars,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkOW5ReEtkb245ajR1N3RtX3hxRTU5V3VrV2hCTVJWM3p4NzVQdXVqeUpRdEI4UGZOMFBZODhid0hTcklScl9QeTlIWGtMLXh5NmRONjdjalhTcnJ6cEpHNFJnX2N0RzF0aWN5bEF0SHRpRms9

in my opinion btc must hodl at least half of the portfolio if you want to succeed and be safe the rest of the distribution according to your research for example i hodl both link and bnb for the long term and with a small part of the portfolio i try smaller perspective projects like ach pica utk and of course without memecoin nothing with about <number> of the portfolio i am in fud rekt coq because they are held by wellknown proven teams,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeHhxN1N5NDdtcE9WdkFCQU1aS3ZocHE2a3UydjFLSlREMGlTZDNMT0RWTG5IWEMyV3JzdURhRkhsdWd6bldMRzZTUEVxekw3RlRQY0JKVW5FallyQmIxdEJ5Y19lc1YtaVlsX2NPX24yQnc9

for me you need to start by nailing down the core concepts and basics familiarize yourself with order types risk management technical analysis fundamentals reading order books and charts news analysis etc dont just scan this stuff but deeply understand it insideout once you have that base down then look for quality advanced material on specific strategies asset classes trade types etc that interest you maybe you want to specialize in futures options margin algos scalping and swing trades with this you need to find courses or books focused specifically on those areas when i started in this market i got many free educational resources from the traders union this page has discussed everything covering the basics and technicals of crypto trading plus apply what you learn through demo trading until you develop consistent profitability do not risk actual capital until youre consistently green and have proper risk management deeply its also wise to find a community of traders you can learn from through discussion surround yourself with smarter traders and absorb that knowledge ignore all those youtube videos and signal services promising ridiculous gains thats not how you develop real profitable trading skills instead focus on building a solid education foundation first,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVHVhckxuMXZFajhlVk5XaVR0Nlplb1NDbmlqMmM0bS10dHFvWnEtS2tKaVpUREgzM3o5VVFacFlBcVFFNWw4d3NzSllvTWx0WlVGaktjSGx0REFTVUE9PQ==

people hate on it because they think its centralised its not and that its a bankers coin meh i can kinda see there last argument but isnt the point of crypto to be a financial used asset we will always need banks and its inevitable that crypto and banking will be as one eventually people may not like the wef or bis but if ripple is working with them and hundreds of other banks and organisations then that should show you how much potential ripple and xrp has people who shit on xrp dont follow the news and partnerships ripple are in so still think its a centralised bankers coin with poor tokenomics when its tokenomics actually help with solving the liquidity problem that the banks are facing people might say it goes against crypto and be your own bank but truth be told the banks will always win and as for people pointing to ta and saying the chart looks terrible also dont know the potential and arent looking at the macro were at the end of a descending wedge getting squeezed ready for a big move and with it being bull season very soon its gonna be a big move up in my opinion im sure someone will chime in and tell you how bad it is based purely off how badly its performed compared to others but then id just point out the case and the constant fud xrp has faced despite all the partnerships and projects ripple are involved with its safer to be in a little bit than not in at all,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQXJhWHNQbjNoOTNTVlJjX0FZdDNzeWZQQXhxajk1WlBhVG5kS29ub0F5YlJWYWtiTzUtMzhMcEkwOFpENng4Rno5ZkxtSzRmVUtRZkVvNFo5RXN0UkxVMU5FY2dVUEVEOGljSWotQWozcDg9

i agree you should never lose yourself in any single part of ta learning all aspects of ta is a good thing it helps you build better strategies you can compare different tools and indicators results against each other and see whether they line up or not if multiple different indicators and tools show similar zones of support or resistance it helps to confirm those areas as being strong ta is never certain it only gives you information for you to make better informed decisions the more information you have the better your strategy building will be elliot wave theory is another strategy theres a number of people out there that only do ew and say anything else is useless and pointless i dont understand their thinking while i enjoy playing around with ew i never base any trade off of it but if a wave count matches up with other ta it helps with confirmation of trend reversals on different time frames both fibonacci tools and elliott waves work well together combine them with ichimoku its pretty good but for me personally the ichimoku kumo is a massively powerful indicator the amount of information you can gather from it with a very short amount of time looking at the chart is incredible its multiple moving averages combined together it shows areas of support and resistance as well as trends ending and beginning all you need to do is skip through different time frames and you can see huge amounts of information at a glance provided you know how to interpret all the information properly over the years ive used other tools and indicators with the ichimoku and what ive learnt is that they line up with the ichimoku quite a lot i dont spend a lot of time staring at charts anymore but when i do have a look at them the ichimoku gives me a huge amount of information very quickly but every now and then i go deep and spends hours doing in depth ta simply for the enjoyment of doing ta ,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlLVk5NnNvbGF6Zk5pakhOQlBjdXZWbkpqQXdsWFdGYXFlTl9NNVZIZ2toODZLcHdUSG9wRW13cXB0UnVBeW1mVVQxbW04VlE0el9NemM0YVoySFdwWVE9PQ==

by in large there really arent any guarantees in crypto you can vet the developers and see if theres any real venture capital behind a project which definitely helps but still nothing certain keeping your tokens in a hot wallet or cold storage avoids issues of the actual platform scamming you like ftx or a platform going broke and taking your money like celsius if you want to do any longterm holding its probably best to stick with bitcoin the bigger stuff like eth or solana or something we can mostly be sure theyll stick around but still no guarantees check out the top <number> tokens from <number> and again in <number> and youll see even the biggest ones can vanish longterm alts any nonbtc token lose <number>+ of their value in the bear market and thats if the project even survives through a bear market start to go with smaller projects and its more likely theyll totally vanish than go up in value again the more volatile a market the more you should trade as opposed to invest,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldWNxemM0a3RraHV1YmppVU1UWjNaSHBjd0J6Wi1CTmlHMGlDWGdSWnh6bGt2Nk12cFlDT2oyMk8wQl9BTzBKZUN1NnktMVdMay1qekF4RXlwRkRNLUE9PQ==

thanks for providing your background tricky indeed crypto sounds like an easy way compared to the other options my suggestion put some money on an exchange binance is big and quite safe whatever that means in this crypto world buy regularly for example buy every sunday start with <number><cur> if btc price on the following sunday is lower buy for <number><cur> again if its higher than the sunday before half your investment <number><cur> on the next sunday check again higher half again <number><cur> lower <number><cur> again repeat additional feature instead of always investing <number><cur> if its lower double your amount of last sunday sunday <number><cur> sunday <number> higher <number><cur> sunday <number> higher <number><cur> sunday <number> lower <number><cur> etc even easier on binance you can setup an auto invest buy automatically with a preplanned interval and amount if you like to get a bit more risky split up your investment in different assets <number> low risk btc eth <number> mid risk midcaps like sol matic ada <number> high risk memecoins single purpose coins like ai fet ocean in your case make it <number>btceth <number> midcaps check out coinmarketcap for top coins and very important do not trust some guy on the internet make your research and find a way you feel comfortable assets can drop hard and you should be able to cope with that if you have questions lemme know,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUGVzcW1jTXZIRFNGZEZTWmNjb3pDb0N1RTUtRE5HUmpnQTFIMU9TYlFRbzJYMzkwVDQyVmlNbXk3c0MzOXh5NUpQbkt1TS1YaTZISlJ6dUJKaURaUnc9PQ==

from what i can tell the speculative hype drives a lot of traders to throw money at random meme coins with basically zero realworld use cases its almost like the actual technology and fundamentals dont even matter some people are just blindly chasing after the next lottery ticket but i have this reading that this meme coin hype is not sustainable longterm i was looking at some expert guides from the traders union website comparing the performance of meme coins in the markets in every review they stated the pros and cons of every popular meme coin that traders should seriously consider the analysis suggests that while meme coins can have insane speculative runs fueled by hype they tend to be extremely volatile and give back a lot of those gains over time in contrast crypto projects with actual use cases and strong fundamentals may grow more slowly but increase in value more consistently as they get realworld adoption so in my view this meme hype is probably just temporary the market seems to go through these speculative moves every so often before the hype transitions to the next new trend for longterm holds i think the smart play is to focus on projects with solid utility and strong development teams behind them,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN3h5OWZxY19oT0R3NzdqTVRyaEZlZUN6amNOZE41RjdEa3dIYzNNS244c19WLW1QV2hiLUZmbzdEQjNCU19LZzR1M3I4VXVmWWRvSEltLWs1UmxiSXc9PQ==

you cant time the market over <number> percent of people who try will lose money trading successful traders have been in it a long time and they understand how to manage risk by setting appropriate stop loss and take profit orders at percentages of the trade in order that the wins outweigh the losses they still make more loss trades than win trades but their actual profits per trade outweigh the losses they also study technical analysis of charts they dont predict the future they make a calculation of probabilities and trade appropriately none of their trades depend on a <number> percent belief in the market moving in one direction personally i use grid trading bots that i wrote myself in python and use the exchanges api to high frequency trade its profitable in sideways markets but stops running in bull or bear markets this is the least risky trading method but its lots of tiny profits that add up over time rather than chasing the big returns unless you are good at math and technical analysis you will lose,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmY0JyRTJIUlNhbG1XOHViT2ZjWkRkZHBOM0wtcnZGdWpMTkg3UV90ay01Sy1HUlZXYUE0azBnaWs3bExxUnJodFBaZDVtNGIwZDJBYWo4QWdBTXBUX1E9PQ==

crypto is almost <number> speculation driven including legitimately useful things like ethereum and bitcoin eventually price discovery will fall in line with other asset classes and things like supply utility stability liquidity volatility fundamental tech use long term average yield rate etc etc its starting already due to the level of adoption and institutional exposure but were still multiple cycles away from it resembling a normal market its like the dotcom bubble yes youll make gazillions if you bet right and its clear its going to be bigger but since nobody really knows what the long term usecases are going to be yet out of the trillion possibilities youre extremely unlikely to choose that unicorn and like the dotcom bubble the winners will become astronomically wealthy and nobody will remember the losers for what its worth im all btc eth and a handful of imo legitimate long term plays for defi periphery things like chainlink tellor dot matic etc and anything that really solves rwa wrapping and crosschain but no obvious leaders in that space yet to me if you think you know please tell me lol,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmMUs0X3ZjOFM3b3RKRk9sdjJnYWxkVmRTR2x4SjF3V0NEdHIxRGxyWS1Eemx3Y2RJTWZHN2thVFF1X25wVncxRzRIbGZ5VDh3MVd3OFBzSmJvVE52ZHc9PQ==

yes you can do this by creating a token on a network with low fees there are several youtube videos to do this i think solana was the cheapest at some point so most tutorials are for solana this is by far the easiest option and if you can find a cheap layer solution on ethereum you can create the actual token in a few lines of solidity code or find a web solution that you can use to create the token for you then its a case of students downloading metamask to manage the tokens the problem is you want a cheapfree method so that students arent paying fees each time they transfer tokens most of the chains will be at least a few pence per transaction and the fee wont be predictable solana went from under a cent for a transaction to much higher once the chain gained popularity in that case you need to set up your own blockchain its more complicated but not impossible amazon aws has tutorials on how to set up a blockchain in an aws instance that you control so the actual transactions will be completely free as you are setting up a single node which will verify all the transactions i am assuming you dont need the security of several nodes <url><url> you can also code a simple blockchain from scratch in python which could run in the cloud or find a github of a pre written code but then you also have to code the website or app to manage peoples funds in a wallet of some kind and it could get complicated quickly coding a blockchain is actually really simple and a lot easier than people think its just a few lines of python code to make a very basic blockchain that handles transactions and a good learning experience to try it i made my own version in a couple of hours and ran it in the cloud obviously the more complex the blockchain and the more functions it has the larger the code,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmdk1BMlJwOEFpV3FvTFl2QjhaV2ZweHB0V2RPcWk1Wk80cHdJUktWa0hBd1BiYjdrN2pQeVp1SmdXSnB2OUlEQnFCWHZON0tEOXY2TFFReS1EbWt3emc9PQ==

this is vaguely something ive been hoping for a long time now send crypto with a username as opposed to a wallet address plus theres securities that if an address is wrong the transaction will cancel instead of being lost in the ether wallet addresses are one of those things which seem simple enough if youve been around crypto a good while but theyre insanely complicated to most and a lot of folks just avoid touching it altogether this should really make it a lot simpler and encourage a lot more people to use wallets in the first place as well as letting people in on a lot more offcex tokens granted its only what mastercard would allow at the moment but as technology goes the good stuff gets copied by anybody would really love to see an easier way to transact with and send crypto,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtR2RaVGMycVRVZzVDbzFEY2RITU42NGNlZGk2WmFlNkZDUDVwTFZBTUFWVWRSa0Zzc2hRa3J6bW9kbnlUR0lVWDl2b3c1V1NlVVk3NkhoRXJUaDdOZVE9PQ==

require rebalancing > > one of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they start out with zero incoming liquidity anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical full cup of water they cant receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little and they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed similarly people who open new channels to the lightning network need to find a way to spend their sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity merchants and lightning node providers often have a lack of incomingliquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity > > there are ways to rebalance your channel capacity but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity and it can be as expensive as a <cur><number> fee per <cur><number> of liquidity > > the disadvantage of soft forks > > the major downside of soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to

dyor has to be more than just going on reddit and asking which coins have the most potential especially memes nobody knows and people who say they do are just recommending coins they want to go up there are sites like coingecko and coinmarketcap that have categories you can sort by including trending coins but it can get pretty overwhelming in my experience with memes you need to be early and you need to get in and out fast they are not for holding long term there are also sites like lunarcrush that are paid to subscribe but have good info or maybe join a discord for some project you like and see what the boys in there are chatting about it really is a gamble theres no sure thing if there was everyone would win and thats just not how it works,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSno4d21wdmp5OHJEVl9xY25CWVNfNElvVGVZdFl5T29Td1pPWjc1VVVWdnJsZnhYWHhiVU4zVlhuQVdYenU3Wm0wMmRaQnRMLWNDLWQtY1B0YzZzLUE9PQ==

i hold a few eth from the early days to be honest i dont buy anymore happy to hold and eventually sell price will go up price will go down at some point well all want to start selling these tokens and only then will we find out what they are really worth the price isnt really being tested while most of us hold right now we all spend a few spare hundred each month then eventually we retire then we all start selling a few thousand a month to live on that will be a big shift in price pressure only then will we find out whether that was the future or not the coin which has a new wave of buyers ready to take our tokens is the one that succeeds and well need a lot of buyers to support the price well all need to sell at i wont be getting excited just yet but im hopeful i actually do think eth has a better chance of sustaining a decent price when the shift happens i feel like bitcoin will go much higher but will crash much harder because so many will start selling when they come to retire,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvOWU4R1hVZEZLN0NrU2lyV2tveExCMzVja01hb084SkZPOGFCRWZxOVMwVUJuM0ZOMFRTSURNdzN3WDR1R1VCTnYtM2NrMWNRT1FqQml3UXl1R2NOLUE9PQ==

personally i look for coins that are strong against bitcoin bitcoin is the staple of crypto its the one that poses the least risk if your altcoin is not outperforming bitcoin then youre essentially assuming the extra risk for no reason i chart everything in btc so rather than only looking at solusd chart i look at solbtc so what exactly are we looking for then bitcoins big breakout of the kk range was a big signal for me that crypto is now a riskon environment bear market over this breakout occurred in october <number> i would recommend looking at some of these charts rndrbtc nearbtc solbtc jasmybtc arbtc pepebtc what you will notice is that these charts are all uptending against their btc value since october <number> this is a sign to me that they are stronger than bitcoin the next surge in crypto should really see altcoins gain value if you look at coins like matic ada and chart them against btc you will see that they are only going lower against bitcoin value this says to me i would rather just hold btc it never feels right buying a token that has already pumped but at the end of the day they are uptending for a reason they are showing strength,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvTEYyaUVBZkoza05vZkJyMXQ3ZUoyTTY1amtWUUVZNG96QlJEUUZpUEhtNnB2WGRhTUt5VVpKUWVuRGgzTHZxanJITVlma3VvakF6UEMtQnBTanQwa0E9PQ==

i partially agree with the author theres no point in holding <number> of the portfolio in btc however if you look at its chart it always performs earlier and better than the main altcoins top <number> by market cap i would recommend all beginners to hold no more than <number> in btc in case we are in a bear phase,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2cEFKTnlheS0xSktfRWFIU2V1c2lVejY2eUtLRjZRR2pBM3RtREw2WHRXUlNTT3R3TVlDc09vX2JZeno2VjRSNDB1TTZudE9jYzZFTjhWUEFWa2JMb3QtQURCeTJZQUw4T2FiNVh0b2RsUFk9
by the way theres no point in holding coins indefinitely the market is highly cyclical and if you spend some time analyzing btc charts and excel spreadsheets you can develop an optimal strategy for buying and selling any quantity of coins at any prices in fact you can effectively generate profits by taking advantage of price fluctuations this also applies to altcoins but i wouldnt hold the majority of these coins for longer than one season,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2QkFKOUs2S0tzaEV4bHZpRDItN004Z3F1VmY1VVcwcjZoNmVXclJIUkZhZk5XRGlxOHFUei1Hc0dtN0xjMDg5bkVCVEFmSHhUZlBEX19md2txNWpJaFhCUlpFVTZlc3N5QUJxVlE2aHF2OVE9

this lack of match is due to insufficient liquidity in the market which makes it impossible to execute the trade during periods of low liquidity the market experiences increased volatility which leads to sharp price fluctuations what is your slippage to resolve the no quotes available error on metamask you need to increase your maximum slippage step by step you can start by setting your maximum slippage to <number> and gradually increase it to <number> and <number> by increasing the maximum slippage you improve the chances of a successful swap however setting the maximum slippage too high could result in receiving more or less of the token than expected therefore it is recommended to increase the maximum slippage in increments,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bGJrSldHVGVkdVlpZ0RWOVBKR1EyUFpMTm82bmlEX0FFNGhyeFBWbEstNkx2VFVCaTJ3MlU2ejdsV0RWQjNoSFlzMTFwS2REN3l0RTQyRXVteTIwY3c9PQ==

you dont have to register wallets depending what coin your are buying you can use a basic software wallet like metamask or trust but these are hot wallets connected to the internet this is fine for small amounts for day to day use for larger amounts you need to use a wallet thats never seen the internet so you need an offline machine thats not going to ever be connected to the internet create your wallet address then save the private key and public key and seed phrase if thats how the wallet was generated if you are just holding coins then thats litterally all you need those keys saved safely written down is enough there is no need for any software or hardware never keep any keys online and never keep large amounts in hot wallets,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eFlWMUVzNVVpWklQWVRVQ1J6SF9yYzhBZU9NSXVZeTJYa3RBcDJPYmxZOTlNUktjcm5DQkRYZ09HLVRsUXRyb1BnWk04V0YzQmJrUG5admtQcUpMTGc9PQ==

hedge funds use a clever strategy called the carry trade to manage their bitcoin investments this involves holding actual bitcoin spot bitcoin and at the same time betting against bitcoin in the futures market hedge funds buy a lot of bitcoin and keep it for example millenium fund bought <cur><number> billion worth of bitcoin this is a big part of the flows over the last <number> days at the same time they bet that the price of bitcoin will go down by selling bitcoin futures contracts if the price of bitcoin does go down they can buy these contracts back at a lower price and make a profit if the price stays flat they profit from the premium bitcoin futures often trade at higher prices than the actual bitcoin by shorting these futures hedge funds can earn the difference which can give them returns of <number> to <number> per year this has been done in the gold market for decades,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4d2l4NVFEQWJvN2xRZFFHeTNFa2lKYm12MHRhdVZ2b09Ha2RRN2tGRlJ3eGd5U1pKUEI4eV9IeS0yd3hCVWlhZkI2UDlfT01IUWFzQlFGcXRaSjd6Qmc9PQ==

this seems like a chatgpt response i understand the carry trade it still doesnt explain why selling a futures contract would have any effect on the actual spot bitcoin price no bitcoin are actually exchanging hands when youre shorting a futures contract right,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4QVpOakRydjN0TWpOaG1QM2Z3dzhqTGRpeDU4TGJsWU5xbGtnd0pOdU5OWTRpV0wxUjE4S0hJeWF2TXQ0ckc0NVl0am04YkhDN1hIYlN3dGZreXBMX3c9PQ==
when hedge funds short bitcoin futures it creates selling pressure this can influence the actual price of bitcoin and prevent it from rising too much even if there is a lot of buying interest this selling pressure can spill over into the spot market especially if the futures market influences traders perceptions of bitcoins value as a result even tho there is significant buying interest in bitcoin etfs the overall price increase of bitcoin stays flat also if the hedge funds are buying otc then their buys are not driving the market price up,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cE05dXFwMkVLWUlEUXRyQ09LMVIzXzgzMlBFWFFzcTFwQ3JqTVBMU010eWI4ZDBfRTNiWHhlZnZxNnJ4Uzk0UFNoYTE4S3hiOEVtZlVlSUVZM2tMLVE9PQ==

i dont disagree with you in terms of the crypto itself my point is more that op is clearly a stakeholder with a vested interest in increasing positive sentiment pump for the increase of their own assets as opposed to the interest of it being a solid investment a pump and dump isnt the same as a rugpull and can happen regardless of whether something is a solid foundational asset,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4TlBhTnhFbUVGT3NsWDNkQTRsa0pjTTlpZFdtUWVhVlpSZ1FMRjBIMWJqWnRDb0hkUmRvTExBZl9WV2duOE5JUUV4REE0ek5HQ2Q5VmdWZW9OQ2VMb19ybXlmNDU4THk2Y1ZWQmszUWVCLUk9

its through arbitrage traders futures contracts have a settlement date when people who have short or long futures positions have to pay the difference between the spot and the futures price the way it works is something like this lets say futures traders start shorting the btc futures like there is no tomorrow imagine this hypothetical scenario there is an endless supply of short sellers who keep pushing the futures prices down no matter what if this happens the futures price will deviate from the spot price so much that some spot holders start to think like wait a minute im holding spot and price is at k futures prices are at k i believe price will be k <number> months from now when the futures contract settles ill just sell my btc and buy futures ill make more gains and thus they sell btc spot which in turn causes the spot price to fall if many people do this which there will be many people doing this if there is an endless supply of short sellers on the futures market and prices are pushed down which is our hypothetical scenario this is how futures can push the spot price down now there will always be some discrepancy between the futures and spot price because arbitrage trades have risks and costs too this discrepancy can be larger or smaller depending on market conditions but there are always forces at play arbitrage traders that pull the spot and futures price closer to each other and it works the other way too if futures prices deviate too much upwards from spot that pulls up the spot price because arbitrage traders will say ok this difference is too big ill just buy spot and short the futures market so they buy spot spot price goes up they win either way either gain on the spot or on their short position when the futures contract expires but the point is that these kind of trades affect the price futures affects spot and spot affects futures if there are strong forces on either side that causes the price to deviate the other will follow sooner or later,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aGFJWndsbXRhUlFxZTdXUG03Z2x4b19BWmdUUU1TY0FTbjVsbmZRQmRZVFhKRE1EQzdDVHJORmVpUkhNcnlEQjV6S25SLUp3Rm9IMzlnNjB1U0RGbEE9PQ==

y+ programmer years trader here programmed myself <number> trading botssystems in php and python i know your struggle and in my experience i can tell up this programmatically determining trends is super hard because of the contradicting natures classic programming is a fixedrules based architecture trends simply are an interpretation of data there are simply too many exceptions to fixed rules a trend can show so yes an uptrend can have <number> bearish patterns or more or less who knows the answer is it depends on the specific situation and chart i got my best result by identifying higher highs and higher lows it works quite well but still i had to work in many exceptions to the rule and im aware that theres no <number> detection a completely different approach is using ai this is not a fixedrule approach anymore but somewhat in the human direction of interpreting data and in my opinion the only way it will still be complex and hard not trying to discourage you but it did cost me hours and hours of programming until i realised it doesnt work that way just trying to give you a heads up of the shitload of frustration your heading into,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5SHZrY1loY1ZnX1J0UGlYeS1WektTcWttZUxKdHBTdnYzN0tCQXV4YzcwWTl6QldjNWpralZrZUh3LTZLTGlPZTh0OHpiSFpvTlRPYUxwODQ3YWRXQ0E9PQ==

i have a friend that calls himself a crypto investor he doesnt own any crypto directly his portfolio is full of bitcoin miners he works like this because he cba to sort out a crypto wallet and doesnt like the risk of things going wrong i guess for him he feels secure in the familiarity of stocks im not sure thats the best approach and i think the technical barrier is easily resolved in the uk you can get a stock and share isa you pay no tax on the capital gains this might represent an opportunity to generate more profit in the uk at least most of the time it doesnt make sense to invest outside of your isa allowance saying that ive not checked the gain in crypto vs bitcoin miners or if they are available within the isa wrapper this might be the real stinger i imagine crypto gains are higher you also have the risk of being a company stocks and shares can be linked to the demise of a company it needs to complete filings continue to operate and someone can fuck up i dont think this operational risk is really true for crypto finally it depends on your personal beliefs around crypto if you believe its just hyped nonsense that will rip maybe you dont need the crypto directly if you believe that it will be a mainstream currency then perhaps owning directly is the answer anyway just some things to consider,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NDl4cjZHSnpuYXI3VXRqeDNCQmw2NExpSjVjWlNkZU4yM25rWTZOTGNHSk16S3FaOEkzcFNvMGdTVG1Eb2U1dTZYWW5rWkU5a1hITk1vbVhxbmpZbXc9PQ==

i think there may be some hype leading up to the inevitable rate cuts however if you study the markets in the past they actually price in that ahead of time and usually start topping out by the time rate cuts begin to happen worse yet they start crashing if the fed doesnt cave in to qe and instead decides to pause rates again at a moderate level like <number>~<number> my guess is that the fed will not qe again this time and will pause rates again to fight inflation and beat it for sure so im not sure if there is much great news for crypto besides a potentially unfinished hype rally till the rate cuts,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dkJCRS04NUhKV0NoYUNoY284Zk5aU291eVJqcjZNalpHOEhqd0RoeWR0WGJuUHh6TU5rWmR4a0VydHdfSnpnS0xfalBYUS01bXdYSzZzbUE5MTVkUlE9PQ==

i havent done any leverage trades yet but from what i researched you can still set a stop loss in such a way that it is impossible to be liquidated the only risk is that your sl will trigger early but if you expect the chart to go in your desired direction then it can still be worth the risk,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2aHR1eHlqSzBjU3Q1ZVhTM0hXV24zNUE5akN4SW1IQ1dXZGFMRVVmOWhVMnZqZkhJMFBxcWlTWVJDT1U1TWJoekNfdGlWTzI1REpoR25KZXdEeWs4U2c9PQ==

best advice i can give you is buy and hodl if you want to trade you really have to learn a lot ive been doing it for years now and it took me a while to get profitable and create a system that works once i found a profitable system i have had to evolve it over time as the markets have changed etc so it takes a lot of work to actively trade thats why you see the other subs preaching to just hold it takes a ton of time to learn and it can be stressful because money is involved yet if you put in the work and gain confidence in your system it can be worth it i literally never stress about trades any more i typically get <number> of them profitable with a net roi over <number> and my losses are never more then <number> so since i track all my trades and run the numbers as long as my stats dont show a dip then i know i am still working with a profitable system good luck with whatever you decide i will say that these days i trade stocks crypto etc all from a skill that i figured out thanks to crypto but back when i learned it was easier,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SHEwUlpSYzY2ZXQ5bUtxMWVOb2ZBVU9vZFpORjk3dnVQcmI2ZDRMM1hFT2FXcEo5am5xWG92c01tTVZ0WGl5RFBkYWEyamYyWFZ6dnZtUklieGs5Rnc9PQ==

buddy this lesson is worth the money you lost leverage is very tricky and requires a very zen state of mind the trap you fell in is common and dangerous better to learn it now than later never try to cover loss with bigger risks thats how at least one bank went down when you lose you sit back take a brake consider what you have left and use low small steps to recover the right thing could have been take higher leverage but with very tiny amounts on a h timeframe tops that way the leverage is higher but the risk is lower that saidits stormyi lost a trade because i desperately craved sushi ,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WnNjazJkbjBTNTkzYUYtQUx6RlVMNnBRbWd1dHZvRjMtS0QyMWhEZzNJUGhPSDQ5cmE2UkhpamUtMDhuanA4cnFrSHFWeFRFaHF5dmRTTG1HUko2a3c9PQ==

i watched a video where it explained that you have to calculate your position in advance with some special formula so that you can set a sl that will trigger exactly where you want it to dont remember the name of the video though but apparently its not as easy as picking high leverage and then picking a sl that is close because you might still lose more than what you should have in truth i have no idea what im talking about though ,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2R2FDQnNxODd3MHNKajFqNTAwNkN5S2U2QlVUT0lLbW4yTFQxdVdIV2ZKcVAxSTFwWEFrdXVpalZTYmZHSmgtWWtXMHlwQnU4LU5GNTZ0UEltYTBQZ1E9PQ==

if you want to be successful leverage trading you will take many losses before you see a consistent profit if you dont you are lucky and will lose it all soon enough the key is risk management you need to lose many times before you start to win so you should never be losing even close to your whole account in a short period of time forget about <number>x leverage your gains and losses should be small and calculated until you prove that you can be consistent for months if youre trying to go for a moonshot youre gambling nothing wrong with that just be honest with yourself and your goals,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZjRWY0dvY205WHN1dXpIUFVjLU5HQko2R0VDRmVtMWtBa2xMSE9qdC13MVJBbWN2amhkSmcyWDI5Wm5FeXBIZEtNTHVoM3ZjUm55MHloRlRPUE44YUE9PQ==

crypto was not created so that the average person wouldnt need wall street that isnt the purpose nor the best use case of cryptographic consensus and the wild price action of crypto is just a byproduct of it being a new asset class also do not let yourself think that just because retail investors have more sway over altcoins that somehow the altcoin market should be immune to macroeconomic effects i appreciate the sentiment here op but it is better to realize the truth that the market is all interconnected and cannot be fully peeled off from everything else happening around it i offer instead a different proposal that it is better for crypto investors to learn how they can use the signals put forward by both wall street and bitcoin to understand the bigger picture of global liquidity so that they can then make more informed bets in the altcoin space,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZGZOOXB1TGN0NHJHZFV4U3U4ZWtWMHFqLXBfSkN2NlJ1YXNkeWRsR3NmSG9IV2htOS1kdTNQQlVuSG1hLTVpcmVEa1I2Q3Nsd3AzQjRlUkx5T1pvSnpDSnFubVE2YjZRd1Vjd2JZS3dzNnc9

i got in around januaryfebruary and stacked more in march in anticipation for an alt hype i sold at a loss after holding and stacking for those months in that short time there was drama around the latest announcement false blackrock hype then there was drama around how the hbar foundation is spending money exec bonuses or something then there was some more drama around tokenization or dumping or something idk man its an older coin that imo didnt catch on and seems like a vc dump i literally just unsubbed from that subreddit today i hold no hbar and have moved on to other projects that show more return potential maybe i will miss the next leg up but i feel more confident in my other choices than this one this is also me learning from bag holding and buying the dip on xrp for years and im not doing that again i may jump back in once hbar gets their shit figured out and they find some traction id rather buy on the way up instead of holding and trying to time the bottom edit to say i think hashgraph and the technology they have is absolutely amazing unfortunately this does not guarantee the hbar token will go up in price,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Qk5fZzBmWml6QWYzSUc4eTkwZEhHZGNvRjl5cEVTbUs3UkpoYmlUNlQxRld1T05HTFJLUXA1Z01ZU2ZPRExfQUhYOF9qTjdUVlQtNnluV1dWMGtnZVE9PQ==

its actually really simple crypto is <number>+ pure speculation its entire value derives from speculation in <number> years there might be serious fundamental value to a certain chain eg eth because of its maturity or dot for its interoperability but for the foreseeable future the value of crypto as an entire asset class is almost entirely purely speculative based on what people believe it will one day be as opposed to what tesla stock is right now they make cars that sell for money that you can buy goods with this means all crypto is the same asset class for economic purposes but additional speculation and manipulation within crypto generates this wildly amplified volatility but fundamentally all chains and protocols facilitate the movement of value crypto so their value is pegged to crypto the asset class bitcoin is simply the largest component of that asset class,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MzV0SmhCbXhjckVIaEpELTFKZ1JjdU5sMXBKY2xCVjhmcVJLU3IzNzFYNldQbUhkMzlOeTA2cFZJY3RBajItYkZVUG1NaW5LZU9Da0ozTjA3YnEybXc9PQ==
its basically a domino effect since a lot of traders use trading bots and spread their investment all across different tokens including btc so when btc gets a significant drop it lowers the graph activating the bots to buy or sell at certain positions and when you get thousands of bots doing the same thing it becomes a huge wave that goes on both directions given that btc is already big in volume its more likely to get an instant significant dump on oppose to its crawling pump up thats how i at least see how it works imo,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4TF9LU0k3Q3hLanJIS29sMG15NHQzSnc0OFQ5cG04N3lIeWhuMWJEQ1AtR2h6VXlZN1NXdHFCU3U3RG9sRFRkSGxQWk5WX0gtYmktX01lSjlTWWVjQm5kOW9ZTEdZbGVNbmdWbVNaay03Snc9

to directly answer your question i have no idea if this particular coin is going to gain traction again feel free to ignore my input from here forward if you wish any and all memecoins have a chance of skyrocketing in value and while i have heard of a few different analysis tools for picking memecoins winners that have been quite accurate i dont ever invest in them why because while they may or may not skyrocket in value every single one of them is going to dump hard when they run out of steam because fundamentally they represent the true gambling aspect of this space they are all fluff and no real value of any kind other than name recognition and meme appreciation if you can put your money into an asset that you know will pump and then inevitably dump hard then go for it the doge dog meme is probably just as valid as anything else but i cant personally justify putting anything like kabosu in my personal portfolio,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4alBLOGk4UmFmQnQ4UFY2NGdseXl0anNpdVJLZE5XaUlqWXNMaDFnNVgteHhFNndoZWdkbFRJN1ZjZUtMTzJiT3UzREREVDNhV2JibklWY09WbXh1VF9yWEo4SXl4cW0tazA2a2tLSEVQdzA9

i think its important to pick a project you have a high conviction in and in which you truly believe dont invest on a whim or out of fomo always do a thorough research and then once you invest just let it be dont check the price every <number> minutes if it goes up after you bought great if not dont worry this is crypto it will go up eventually just stick to your guns and dont stress out and dont act on fud and ideally not on fomo either and invest long term rather than short term its much healthier for your nerves and mental health and also better for your money in the long run,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNENVFKTU5IOGN1dktKOW0wTEhKUFl3ckhlbE5MWGxMY1VoMzBCRTFXd3cxR0pwVkxaZGZlWnFiV2hlY0ZvekVRNTc4N0gtU09MZVFFNF9ObFhCSzFJWEE9PQ==

the things that made the main difference for me <number> becoming an investor instead of a trader as a trader i was trying to guess the direction of my positions over the next few hours but that didnt have anything to do with the fundamental value of the projects that felt like trying to guess the next wind gust while in a hurricane i would panic as soon as i was losing any amount of money and that isnt sustainable as an investor i realize its impossible to buy a coin and expect to always be in profit price action whips back and forth often based on no news about the project at all i learned to analyze projects and determine if they are undervalued compared to where i think they should be relative to the rest of the market and its this kind of analysis that has made me a great sum of money <number> developing conviction before deploying money this is the reason i dont buy an memecoins could i make more money if i did yeah maybe but i have zero conviction in them and i wouldnt be able to hold on to them if i bought turbo today and it went to zero i couldnt even be surprised because it like the majority of crypto projects is absolute garbage as a project the crypto world became way way easier for me when i started to realize what aspects of crypto projects make them actually valuable in the first place also watching the market through covid helped me i watched in real time as the bitcoin price fell off a cliff in march <number> and then rebounded if that didnt kill crypto then its going to take way more than an unfavorable fed meeting to kill it <number> only investing up to the point where it starts to feel uncomfortable and not past that i have seen the phrase invest only what youre willing to lose stated here a bunch of times but it feels a bit disingenuous im not a gambler i look at my investments as bets towards what is going to be big <number><number> years from now and i do actually buy when the price of each of my assets is down and everyone is saying crypto is dead this happens all the time and crypto is never actually dead never fomo into a project that is pumping buy when projects are on sale and take your time adding to positions it takes time to get used to seeing your positions move up and down all the time,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEMm1RVF9jQUR0eWJvc1I3WWEtNzZsd1RkVndMbVFhWFVNQjJEVkRaNjhuT1NyZ0NFSjBjb2tWZTNQbkhZbU1XY1hxZ25namtPU0Rxa2RXMlluUDJBU1RmVVJPQk85T3JIUlNYMnQ4cXh5S1k9

just be careful ive been in crypto long enough to see how the doge community turned toxic for a while when the price fell off a cliff from the all time high anything where the entire community is based off of price action of the asset is at risk of doing this and i expect turbo will face the same turbulence as the bull run peaks is there money to be made in turbo sure i have no doubt about that i just dont personally feel comfortable putting any real sums of money into memes when i know there is nothing to them except for community interest turbo was literally built off of a chatgpt prompt that is extremely interesting to me but not something i can stomach putting tens of thousands of dollars into and feel comfortable not checking the price every <number> seconds out of fear of implosion,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERUl2cm1JNFY3TVZMY0JKOXFpcVM3ZDlHSEtIMllOWjJhMmFZWE9LQk44THc3aFc2NFhjRFRPQllfMnBvRkhpalNqemRZeVhvZGZZZ19qekhoQzdaelEtNTdTOEZHRXRMOWxiclNxcHBHWFE9
ive got a good bit but truthfully i see eth alts pumping more percentage wise over the next run btc is the one original that will always be around and for the most part eth will also but unless eth becomes faster and cheaper eventually someone will claim its throne these eth i view as just ways for the gov to infise themselves deaper into the crypto world by letting big pockets grab as much as they can maybe im wrong but i long for a world where there is a fast cheap functioning xmr that is accepted everywhere off centralization and btc and eth are essentially what they are right now investments im not a solana guy so i dont have much of an opinion on that and i think xrp has gotten in bed with there enemy it just hasnt completely reared its head i like the thought of kaspa and if krc gets out it will probably get in the top <number> its already made a jump since the announcement of marathon mining it,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEb01rWlVDT2ZPYTRQeDBXb2JuczhKd1l1cTBuSVVMUENoNXJ4UFpJRkp5YVJEeHppOVZaTkF3ZFFmRE52MzFDS28zOTFyYTZzUVJRRGlyRU1yTGRPWHc9PQ==

im stepping away from this market until i can learn some discipline when a trade goes against you and you close it out and then it reverses right back then you panicked when a trade goes against you and you close it out and then it keeps moving against you then you were disciplined its as simple as that thats a bit of a joke as a trader definitely needs trade entry and exit discipline and risk management discipline however if you cannot rationally and reasonably explain why you have an edge over the general market you cannot expect to make money trading other than by pure luckwhich is usually fleeting this begs the question are you trading or investing i no longer trade i invest i made a very good living for over <number> years trading options professionally at the end it took me a few years to realize that my edge was gone no longer definable and wasnt coming back bottom line though if you are trading in and out of anything why should you make money vs the other side your trade can you really reasonably define why this is not advice to invest in cryptoi own zero cryptoi just like readinglearning about it,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbWRUdHZlRk5SRm9qUFNSY3ZHZEdQQzctR2dkYXZ6VHI5bVpUZzZudUVJMzQ0R28zVGxuMnVfYi1zNV9pN08tZEZGR3JUVjFYX1dmMUpyX1UyQngxVmc9PQ==

it takes a lot of experience to be able to interpret how the market is behaving for instance this current crypto market is seeing the death of most of the cryptos we all know thats why we are seeing them do <number> and <number> retracements from their recent runs they just have no conviction this sentiment is different for each bull run as we have had different factors going into each in crypto its never a good idea to invest you may end up losing most of what you put in because these projects are dead and never going anywhere the best strategy is make entries when prices are low very low like i said before when prices are like <number><number> down from highs thats when you get in another thing about timing is that you dont need to always be trading if you had waited for lower prices youd be in a better position also while <number> movements are normal for crypto set stop losses you really dont want to be down more than <number><number> on something thats a lot and will be a while or never to see it back there again bitcoin and ethereum i would say are the only ones you can just ride through the pain eventually they come back one last thing is timeline new investors should be looking at timelines that are in the months if you buy bitcoin today expect to ride the good and bad days for a while say <number> months or <number> months these markets take a long time to move and you need to be patient with them,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNESE9Tb2R0UTI1Vkc1Ml9OUFMyamVJWEplMXh5dkFvdGs0SE0yTE1DN1pCX21EZk40RUwzZlYzZHVvdUptRGFlSE5meDJvS3VpMTh4R2kwakFPSk5BNnc9PQ==

my best technical analysis comes from fundamental analysis and high time frame price action charts that said i dont trade daytoday i analyze projects decide where they should be on the crypto market cap rankings based on their tech attributes and use case and then i figure out what the price of the coin would be if it were at that coin market cap position there are projects out there that i consider to be wildly undervalued compared to their use case potential and i buy and hold them as long as the historical price action shows potential growth for example a lot of crypto projects either have a major spike early and then drop off a cliff and never return to that level likewise in many you can identify the point where the dev team dumped all their holdings and i avoid those like the plague,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFa25sMG4zNXpXZGtjRUVGaDF1Rk91dDlmTGFHb0EtSG5HMC1XTXgtU1dNUW1GaDNlWTlnX21BUWNDUG5fS0ZxUTVXUEdIRThtZ3hMOFBYLUJsU2JMUGJEa0VoN21WVTM5WVJfdkh0WlJaTmM9

what was your entry into crypto my impression is that many of us start by getting orange pilled via something like the hidden secrets of money series by mike maloney some of us stay btc maxis and some are willing to branch out to altcoins either way we come to realize the difference between money and currency money is a store of value over time what we tend to think of as money in fiat is really just currency that loses its value due to inflation does this mean we should put our entire life savings of currency into one memecoin on solana ofc not we should still respect and appreciate what we have theres lots of great advice here from others time spent in the market > trying to time the market investing > trading the list goes on but i believe theyre all secondary principles derived from a deeper theme im talking about being consciously aware that currency is losing its value so we should try to allocate it towards something that either retains value or appreciates in value across the span of one or more cycles admittedly we all roll our eyes at anyone who says theyre purely here for the tech and underlying philosophies people who say theyre here solely for the money though they mean fiat are at least being honest the problem for them is theyre at a greater risk of being tossed around by their own emotions and being manipulated by pd influencers since obviously they place fiat on a pedestal in a similar vein there are people who invest in crypto despite believing that its worthless and a bunch of air as warren would put it my question to them would be do you really want to invest based entirely on the greater fool theory granted in some technical sense were all in a game of musical chairs where we take turns being exit liquidity for each other even when you buy a bag based on fundamentals whoever buys your bag later is your exit liquidity if that frame brings somebody success cool my concern would be that such an individual would become so obsessed over who is the exit liquidity that they cant see the wood for the trees i personally believe youll get rekt if you dont have conviction and dont see any value in your investments if youre in such a hurry to hand off your bag of air to your exit liquidity then you could be missing out life changing gains oh shit i dont want to be left holding this bag full of shit air sure that works if youre jumping in and out of a pd scamcoin on a dex somewhere but you need to ask yourself if you hold those underlying views and are applying them to the longterm cycle,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNmhPUktONm1QclY1ZmtHLTZ4WkhMLW5pOVpRdmU1di1xNGZ0ekZmOV8wU0xCQ1pZclIzVFoycE4xQ0RPSnBrVVJ2SUx3YVlvbW4yTDVkZUc5Q2dQUWc9PQ==

exercise extreme caution with questions like these scammers are obvious but there are also shills who push their latest memecoin hoping to create liquidity while they offload your best bet is to invest in the big basics like btc eth and native tokens for chains you believe will be successful over time id urge you to look at the price charts for solana before listening to the people saying to put money there solana price is being artifically propped up by a massive wave of celebrity scam tokens and is around its alltimehigh buying now is likely to be buying at the top with a good likelihood of a <number> drawdown back to more typical levels coming thats only an educated guess but solana is trading at prices similar to the late <number>early <number> bull run consider long term price action or you may get caught holding for two years just hoping to break even one recommendation that i didnt see below is chainlink dont expect a sudden moon rocket but look into the fundamentals and you will see <cur>link already has real world use cases and partners like google and associated press may not have significant price action for awhile but if you are looking at a longer time horizon the utility provided may turn it into a real winner big picture you may also want to set aside a small portion say <cur>k and break it up into <number> <cur><number> lots and throw it at memecoins with a sell order at x due to the gambling nature of those projects they often have ludicrous pumps before crashing going in early and seeking a conservative x is going to greatly increase your chances of making a profit before the inevitable crash at that point pay back your initial <cur>k and use the returns for gambling on house money if you lose it all then your initial investment is still protected above all things do your own research including both technical and fundamental analysis before buying anything you plan to hold longterm and remember most gurus and influencers make their money through marketing for projects not through offering legitimate advice,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFWl9zc1QyTkdPeGpGTFdWenFPSHc3SmZFaTJwTDVLTks1bWR6T1hOeXN0clBqbENhVVFJeWM0MmJaLWJWbmJXdS1XMHBGYzJCaEJaMDJRLU9MdFNyTlZLRHNUY3F0dXdMQW1JZkZVbkEtZ1E9

its already stoped out i dont disagree that there are forms of leverage trading that are gambling but thats not what im doing gains network and gmx are paying arb token rewards for open and close fees on their platform i open and close massive leverage trades generally at a wash and end up farming the rewards yesterday alone i earned <number> arb tokens just from reward kick backs for opening and closing leverage plays i also use leverage shorts with <number><number>x leverage to hedge lp farms to create a neutral delta for the price exposure of the farm assets leverage trading is not just betting on price direction that would in fact be gambling thanks for your concern but i am not gambling leverage perpetual contracts are just a part of my investment strategy if anything i would recommend you try some perpetual trading on gains or gmx since the kick back rewards make the risk profile accessible even for a gamble those rewards started yesterday so you are here day one of this reward campaign,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFLVBlOEJvcC1aX3FMdXBNOUxBNFg0a01ZY21LV1VQOXRYYnZSdG9weHA2NEZ1cE8xU0pLWWVwX2pwM25JMDVicEZSUHdSR0FFVEdiWUVtZVMzTk9ON2c3UE9TdTRJQzF5b0JkMDVQOXJaZ0U9

the situation is a little confusing for me tbh stocks are going crazy at ath election year general state of living economy is terrible and people are struggling real bad where will the funding come to take crypto up that far if day to day expenses are difficult is crypto the risk worth taking with the funding people have available when prices are at k to fomo buy in when the room to pull back feels greater like a jenga tower if wars are upon us gold will touch a higher peak and possibly digital gold bitcoin as well being safe heaven asset because the dollar is very slowly being turned away from as the dominant global currency at such difficult times in business would people transact in crypto risking their business capital on the volatility of it going the wrong way america printed so much money during covid it avoided a recession but that led to inflation and money becoming less valuable makes me wonder if bitcoin even gets to k at that point what will the spending power even be of it in usd if the dollar gets screwed because of us debt and economic troubles its already facing so intensely thinking out loud sounds horrible to say because its the last thing i would want but it seems like the world would be better off if everything crashed and reset,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFOXBRMGtOU3Fadk92S1JkMEtUV2xDa1g2UV9XQV9faUhUZ0ZxX2RJV0ZFSGRvZ1lQVFBQSUNkblF0UXRjV2ROWGEyc3hZeEdRSHNRNG5kQ25CVTY2cnc9PQ==

i guess my biggest concern and also that of any boomer or serious investor is the logistics behind tying the value of these properties to this token for starters selling a token with the promise of future profits from the participation in a shared enterprise is a security offering i dont see their sec licenses for doing so in which case the work around is claiming the tokens being sold are not securities and have no value proposition or expectation of performance promises of future developments without any existing product or prototypes are risky i like their pitch but absence or vagueness in the documentation is a red flag projects that set overly ambitious milestones without a clear roadmap for achieving them can be problematic its impressive what they claim to have done so far but the verifiability of those claims is lacking for sure im not looking to trust them if they want those minimum commitments i love the idea of real world value portfolios tokenized into block chain assets but that tech has no decentralized open source standard yet and is still very much in the hype phase i will keep my eye on this uncn project but its not investable for me in its current form,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFeTZqSVpqWEw2Y04xRjd1dkpzV0htaTY2dmdnc1gwaDV0S1EzTW5IRURaZGdUdjZmUExQQnRsemx0WUUxZkJubFFrYThiUWktNGk2MHZDNlQ0ZnAwNGR6OHdxckgzMWlqcXhaOERLdHJXdFU9

yes sir this month im <number> on my leverage trading portfolio by opening short btc or eth with its collateral covered in kind i am basically locking in the current spot price what i did this month was set the short sells around k in btc once the short is in profit i set a stop loss the stop loss will close the short and put me back into my collateral assets so back into btc spot i also will move the stop loss further and further into profit as the position moves deeper in the money then i am holding spot until i see an opportunity to lock in some of that gain by opening short again if the short is not in profit i let it ride the margin is infinite so theres not risk of liquidation and worst case i have locked in my sell price at the moment i went short,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGdEJ2MTQyX1NxSy03RUNIVlc5MHRfa0dMdGpkanp3eElDV1lkWlJWTm1tWm95TmpIdDFzMnNvajNJQzRaWEN5LUI5OHFOcFF0LWhBNVBZbVNHR0w3R3pSOWhjel9saVgxdnBoTTJNb2pLbmc9

the whole point of these movements are to squeeze people like you out people place leveraged trades predicting the market exchanges and lenders often move the market against these to either get them to close their positions at a loss pocketing the difference in collateral likely provided by them or even better for them to liquidate these positions entirely taking all their money as collateral + the lending fee if you buy crypto tokens buy the ones that show the least volatility and buy consistently over time never in one shot once bought dont consider them money so much as your collection of tokens accumulate those tokens stake them lend them make them earn more tokens and keep buying fiat as we know it is in huge flux the defacto currency of the world is likely to flip where the money ends up is anyones guess but i dont think everyone is going to want to inherit the chinese yuan how about maybe a currency we can run as a democracy of our own where every individual has a vote on how collective wealth is invested rather than relying on bankers that weve never met and entrusting them with the financial stability of our entire nations this exists as blockchains,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGRWwyRWJVLWRrT0FGVmhvXzdJVHlxT2dOU1dvT25pZ3VzY09HbkYzVUxtVkZseG9GV3hvZi0zT1BjY0pva3AydURHSlI0TGNQRm9Ga1ZGRlhhRG1yN2xkNnVTeno2TTl2UWZOb3h0OWktWnc9

bitcoin and top alts the days of crazy lifechanging gains might be over but imo its crazy to not take advantage of this market still right now im a poor person and not an expert by any stretch but for example the last couple years ive doubled my investment by only messing with btc and a little dabbling in top alts like sol and i probably would be doing better if i hadnt sold as much in <number> ive been better about identifying the tops in <number> though memeget rich quick coins you can still get huge gains if you pick the right one and this will always be true but its not a fair game to play with new tokens especially there are various ways that devs can screw over the holders and it even sometimes happens with tokens that have high scores on sites like tokensniffer so not only do you have to research thoroughly and quickly to try to avoid scams you also have to get lucky enough to have your choice tokens pump conclusion there are legitimate gains to be had in the safetop altcoins and bitcoin not crazy lifechanging gains but gains that you still dont wanna miss out on,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGdGFnX3BxNFJZUVVBTGNVVGxmQzExWE9obXRSVXB6Ry1SR0tXb0h2WVNkZm9OX2JNNnpGQ01xUXE5WW1XNGdnM2V3Sk01dmpta0laZTNGb2hoTEwweTkwWGJReVJPV3I5WU9iT0h3UklaazA9

i do think chinas market in general is primed for a sudden very hard burst upward in value before a sharp decline similar to japan in the s and s they are positioning themselves to make powerful political moves soon with strong threats with tariffs manufacturing and spending already most games and movies are being made with the thought of what would china think of this in the back of their head because that market is so large that even a tiny piece of it is worth it india is the other country that is poised to see a ton of growth since they have had such a large population boom and are now seeing more money start to flow into india adani is a man with a vision that can lead to a large economic boost for india and a lot of manufacturing is moving from china to india currently as it is indias growth will be much slower and would be more akin to buying btc in the early speculative stages but with a little less risk i think since india is already starting to prove its value and is growing there will be bursts here and there where it will go up in value and hold most of it and the hard burst up is kind of a decade or two off kind of thing so theres a lot of time to make investments there,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGMDdlZWpEQVFBTEFUelh2ZWZxalZmM1hvV1RyWERNekVDSXEwVzBLOW9rakFza2h4azlwT1hOZWRLNzRxX2Z4ZzAzRGNXLTRXYkoySm5CZVFCa3kxMUE9PQ==

again im new to this too so dont take advice from me i subscribe to <number><number> popular crypto influencers on youtube they all have their favorites and they all have conflicts of interest aka they are recommending coins they own trying to pump their own bags but they will start to give you an overview understanding of large mid and low cap coins then start figuring out what you believe in ai gaming real world assets then start doing your own research parallel to following updates on youtube i dont recommend aping into any coin just because its already pumped <number> inevitably it will go down probably right after you buy only buy coins you believe in and only invest an amount of money that equals your level of belief otherwise youll sell at a loss at the first <number> drop good luck edit ive used robinhood kraken and coinbase and i prefer coinbase,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGTkVZSGdGNTBjQ3RPcElNYjRVbG42S1NXUlFfNlF0bE1UaEQtbEx4MUpXdnhKS0k1bXhNOGRBVi1wcXppU2p6M2FqNVg2UUVmOFJJVC1vUE9VazM4R1E9PQ==
i set this sort of service up <number> years ago and have found that people who have money and are serious about investing it do not want to manage their own funds i had to pivot the business to basically be able to allow clients to invest in the business so the business will manage their funds for them people with real capital dont have time to manage an investing portfolio for the most part they are busy with vacation boating skiing and travel lol youre targeting a niche of a niche i still maintain the subscription service along side the investment business but its a small community and my fee is <cur><number> per month there is interest in these sort of services but its very difficult to acquire new members and almost impossible to run adds that dont get taken down for some automated flagging even though my business has all the proper licenses and is registered in california,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGX2F1VlVoV3R2dEMzUWxTUGJUZ1M2UnhRVmU5RUpYaTI5TlplRU5oZEpEaXNRNGJqTWRpRlZkTlEzb0JBWGlvTHJhV0M0c3ByeUx1cmdfWEVrb2hOMGtPR0syNDNPcTVsQmhTLTFvUVl6elE9

my take is that the big money in crypto has already been made youre not going to get the returns that someone who got in early to btc or eth early and who tend to be most bullish and are up by <number> <number> or <number>x there are undoubtedly opportunities that come up for instance being early in ordinals like nfts but on bitcoin which launched last year had some great opportunities and there have been some successful meme coins like <cur>pepe that have had good returns a lot of it really just comes down to timing and also knowing when to take profits as many things will go up by massive amounts and then tank think bayc there is still money to be made in crypto but usually not easy money,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGbGpHZmhpeTdOYmFYVElLUmpITGdxczJ4VFFmdDljWVJMSExSTDVKSWFhOWFFOGl2RWRUd2hmenB4OGZxbDh6T3hTM0FVTTdLRGVoakRyeW1ENmJtckYwQVhXb0dtR1NOZDRWOVpHYmpsM1U9

i wouldnt say theres a single best ta method but i can tell you whats worked well for me the macd is great for confirming those signals and rsi helps me avoid buying into overbought markets or selling in oversold conditions plus fibonacci retracement is another tool i love its like a magic tool for identifying support and resistance levels i use it a lot to spot potential reversal points and plan my entry and exit strategies i have adopted this one from the traders union you can visit this one if you want to dig deeper they have a ton of info on different technical analysis methods the key thing ive learned is that no single indicator is a magic bullet its more about using a combination that makes sense to you and your risk tolerance and as you said staying on top of market news is highly important sometimes that outside info can confirm what the charts are hinting at or give you a whole new view still its all about practice and tweaking your approach as you go dont be afraid to mix and match strategies until you find what works best for you there will be wins and losses but thats part of the learning process,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGV0luTHhMRmNXeDdwWjFhcTNPVWZ1Q3lmbmpWN3pnWW5nYU5GLThmNXR2SldfeWZoX1pWdFNrSE9GVVl2cWIzdUZJLXBHWXJxSlgwY3ZHUDJXYjdLTFE9PQ==

dash is probably a better currency than bitcoin im not refuting that but im proposing something that i believe is quite important time has proven that dash is not sufficiently usable enough as a currency for the public to care much a decade of existence and it only has a market cap of <cur><number>b means that its tiny and does not have a ton of prospects of increasing that position in this case if it were new or particularly novel then i would be interested but its block rate is slow even compared to many proofofwork projects the fact that it is proofofstake make it a rich get richer coin even though you claim to oppose that mentality and theres nothing about the project that makes it uniquely useful as a spending currency compared to other existing options as for your final statement the analysis of alternatives here should not be between dash and memecoins meme coins are useless junk in the long term and there are plenty of legitimate projects out there that are trying to solve the blockchain trilemma its entirely possible to invest in a cryptocurrency that is valuable as both a store of value and as a usable peertopeer currency but dash seems clear to me to not be the answer if you like dash by all means buy it i just dont personally find it to be compelling given its characteristics,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHejlobkhPOVFwU2ViaVY0enMwTGlxQV9vbXN6cjdnVUFlNzNrOGh5c0VRX0luZ2lDblBDSWtyQ1pZQWhUUXlDNjFqeHB1V01oMzh6X2xaZkJnY2VnX0JhMldHcDFpeEt4YlV4YklBOGp4azg9

look at the technology a lot of crypto projects have interesting reallife use cases if you can use a bit of intelligence and insight you can make very decent gains there are a lot of naysayers of course but its really about how you position yourself can you be strategic can you ride the cycles are you able to preempt where the conversation and the consensus in the market is going the beautiful thing about crypto is you dont need to rely on the fundamentals too much like you would in the stock market because they are much less defined and much less timetested its a lot more fun because of this but thats exactly why its high risk as one other commentator said it operates more like a commodity its similar to pricing for wine or art in that its intrinsic value is given to it one thing i will say it pays to be critical you have to make up your own mind if you cant be a truly independent thinker it will be much more difficult if you can be you can do really well,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVmpZRHFIbWw2R2JXQVo0WUxvRWFpQ3MxQzc1WHBGT2dPcWFuQXA2UGt2WlZTSkhfb2N0SXBkX1lkVFR2enhwSFpTZTlka3VWNm45cWRwcGZNTDVrbnc9PQ==

yes evm is not unique to ethereum hence bitcoin ls are adopting it as well to enable better interoperability with other evm chains including eth itself other blockchain vms exist as well but besides solana none of them are getting anywhere near the traction of evm regarding private blockchains its just not necessary nor worth the hassle for most corporations so far many have tried to use a hyperledger chains but ultimately abandoned these prospects check out international shipping companies there is not much advantage to private chains over just ethereum when you can write your smart contracts to be fully permissioned and centralized anyway,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHUFlHN0l0NlRUcHd0RHRaekYyOTViZ1Y3SjdfV0RfWk4xM2pENlU4QUY0dXgyNG5QZWEyd1RQOThzQ1VaT0dSY1hTRE45LVNUN2NJLVlrYmhGN05WYUE9PQ==

i can write a long answer about this and we can discuss in dms if youd like but the top real world use case at this exact moment is the hard money use case that bitcoiners also claim btc to be it takes the two major strengths of bitcoin fair launched decentralization and extremely secure proofofwork then adds on top of it what bitcoin does not have extreme scalability now the theory is that bitcoin was novel in that it invented electronic hard money and ethereum was the next major milestone by making digital currency programmable kaspa intends to take both of those novel concepts and combine them many kaspa fans like myself believe pow to be inherently better than pos and so the prospect of combining the two major innovations within crypto is exciting theres no doubt that kaspa is just in the early stages of this and projects like ethereum and solana are currently implementing that second use case very well with a lot of projects on their networks kaspa is only two years old and so this use case is just now rolling out on kas so current investment in kas is speculative on this part that said the market cap is very low compared to what it will be when it is running with various projects on it happy to discuss more if you want in dms,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNSVc0U3ZhdGc0WXFaVXcybWpiS1drazQtLVA0bVpiT3lvUUg0NEtUSnJWa2xxalBkUDZnWFZtZllwSlJOMTlhNjlpalhJbnJnLWJIdGJYUjVnQUF2Z3pBRXJoMDBEWEFRbjhJdFhWLWZqUzg9

im so annoyed by this im not voting for trump but you do know that this guy had an entire term already and this didnt happen like the guy was never even close to being able to suspend democracy and replace the constitution with the bible he spent his entire term fighting with the democrats and his own administration to get anything done his few legislative victories are all things biden shrugged his shoulders on and kept as law when he took office anyway his presidency was a national embarrassment but a threat to democracy please if i can have one thing this election cycle it would be to have a normal fucking conversation about the pros and cons of the candidates without people shitting their pants over whichever candidate they dont like oh trump is gonna enslave the mexicans and force them to build a wall and institute a thousand year handmaiden style reign oh biden is gonna turn my son trans and send my daughter to epsteins island fuck off,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNWUlkM2tuczM1T2J4d2Ixem9oWllBc2prTGhkaFlTUXVaY21TcmswYWpxUWN2WWVlYld4WE1BWkViYkxIYjhfNHQwQzdhazI1XzNxdGktTkpyZzhEMjRWd3pxVTJ0dHdrSzgybmZZYWxaeFE9
as far as btc and eth go bitcoin will always be the main store of value in the crypto market so thats always going to be a solid investment however ive never felt as good about eth because it just doesnt have the same kind of permanent value btc does eths main value is in its ability to run dapps and its been relatively slow and expensive compared to other dapp platforms for a long time it really is only a matter of time before eth gets dethroned by another dapp platform that just does the job better but that cant happen to a store of value like btc,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNMDBQLWZkY0xoMnBFbnZWUmwtVkhvVE01M0c2N1BvSUpjQmR5am1hUk81UHZDNGJjdExxeVBGTUgxd2VzNm1yaTNfai1Xd2tIcm96MFM3dVRmVEZUMkE9PQ==

id love to have a normal conversation and argument about which policies of both candidates but the fact remains that trump is far from normal and really doesnt have any policies he is running on he is personally running on a platform of retribution and pardoning himself so he doesnt go to jail both are horrendous the people that are footing the bill for his campaign however are running on project <number> which will turn this country into christian theocratic state with an dictator at top also horrendous and this is all before you mention all the multitudes of other horrible things trump has done and promises to do the last debate he blamed every problem on immigrants every single one he lied and said immigrants are all rapists murders or mentally ill and are invading our country abhorrently racist trump is also open to taking money from oil companies in exchange for legislation that will help them even more than they already are subsidized the list of horrible ideas and problems goes on and on trump fundamentally doesnt care about anyone but himself he will do and say whatever he needs to stay in power and out of jail meanwhile biden and the democrats are running on actual policies that will help regular americans biden wants to increase funding for the border particularly to increase the number of staff that are processing paperwork so the legal pathway to citizenship is no longer the huge pain in the ass that has made illegal methods a viable option the democrats want to restore a womans right to make medical decisions about their own bodies the democrats want to increase funding for infrastructure green energy home energy improvements etc to help everyone as we transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy the democrats want to make meals at schools free for all kids to help with childhood hunger the republicans are actively fighting this the democrats want to reduce the cost burden of childcare services the democrats want to mandate parentalleave at a national level to help both the child and parents the list goes on and on,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNMm9odkxHSGlRVzZ3SlFOSGxFa3ZWSmEwNWVFXzBHYWlKUlNfRzgxYWtOVFF0M0hQNEhmRzY2c25yU3JtdjVnLXI4dUtoMXdPY1VnQkVqcWNPRHBDbHc9PQ==

its not a ponzi scheme but i do agree with you about that it was supposed to be money not an investment it was meant to be used and to provide its users with secure censorship resistant fungible money its failed at all those things but it is not a ponzi scheme by definition the people at the top get paid by new people buying into the scheme bitcoin doesnt pay out a dividend theres no people at the top getting dividends from new people money to get money out of bitcoin you have to sell your coins thats not how ponzi schemes work the moment new people buying in stops a ponzi comes crashing down if people stop buying bitcoin the price stops going up it doesnt collapse a crash in price is when more people are selling btc then buying it its not a collapse of the network people are buying crypto because they want to get rich quick they have no understanding about the fundamental basics of what crypto is about the only project that is really the true crypto is monero,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNa0otV1V6SExRVTFiV3Y1eGVNd2RuVEw5RDRqNEMzUWZTNnpjd1phWm5LUUI0SEZpbFVuV1Z0V0t0ZFVic09VdUo2SS1qY1BnN3NGaFFtOHBGNkZkd2c9PQ==

and the doubts are the same every cycle we should expect the same thing in <number> the halving doesnt trigger a bull run what triggers a bull run is the slow buildup of strain on the incoming supply of newly mined coins after the halving and that takes <number> to <number> months why picture the market for bitcoin as if its a giant lake buyers take water out of the lake and sellers dump water in but theres also a river constantly flowing into the lake in this analogy the river is a steady flow of newly mined coins entering the market dam up a river and the level of the lake it feeds into will eventually drop but it takes a while for the effect to be noticed because the effect of the dam is tiny at first but it builds up over time once every four years the halving cuts the flow of that river of new coins in half which means even if demand for bitcoin stays flat there wont be enough coins for sale to meet that same level of demand thats why after the halving it takes four to six months for the halved amount of new coins in the block reward to have an effect on the market think about it when the halving happens it only affects one person the miner who won half as many coins ten minutes later another miner wins only half as many coins as before the halving ten minutes later another miner ten minutes later another it takes <number> to <number> months for that to add up to enough of a change on the entire supply to cause a shortage but eventually there wont be enough new coins reaching the market to meet demand that causes a supply shock which causes the price to go up,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOLUhVZVJoT1BwdVphYWVhYnRuZ2JSdDVzaklzX1pHU05BMEdNOWpSMVU2X1R3TEM3Q3dyVWFxUGl1cmxPa3NLcHViWFdHLVZSaDhfa2xNUThCNmthLTlEYmQwdWxMbTMtbHVpck52WFdWQWc9

bitcoin went up with the rest of the stock market it went up because weve had an economy with cheap money high growth and a healthy risk appetite now we were forced to hike rates because inflation is out of control credit and venture capital is at all time lows and this pump has been mostly from savings and more and more people are losing their jobs stocks are not performing well its all concentrated in a handful of big stocks not the russel not low or mid caps not retirement accounts literally nothing is up except for big companies like nvidia so things dont look very good at all actually on one hand the crypto market is acting the same way it always has alts bleeding like this is normal right before the big bull run and we seem to be holding these lows for now the only bad thing is we need to see things like the russel start taking off for any chance at a crypto bull run but the large indexes have broken new highs for a year while everything else did squat barring a war i dont see how the government can work its way out of this one without a long recession so i think the fear this time around is absolutely warranted personally im worried sick recessions can last a long long time,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNObWZjQWV4ZVUtYmxsalRYTGM4U1pyMFZFX21ta0RQUE5LOG84RGpjY09ELVl5MVZkN3pkQkVsTE5IMklyYTJjaUZCNHBUZGhaTkpCOUJhR3VKUGRqR3c9PQ==

my response to these sorts of posts is to say just look back at what people were saying a few months ago everyone was so certain it was hitting k as it went to k so much certainty but everyone was wrong it stalled it barely broke the ath few sold at the top and thats that now it tumbles again and now we see a load more predictions which will all be wrong its humbling to go back and read the sentiment from when this bull run was actually charging up do the same for <number> posts nobody knows with hindsight you can see everyone is wrong with the occasional stopped clock even a stopped clock is right twice a day if betting on a line randomly going up and down isnt for you then dont play the game actually we do know one thing its volatile i might buy every time it drops <number> and sells every time it doubles my new strategy locked in lol,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORjhMQ3AybkJJSzF1eUstcFlEYmtvZzRzV0p0VE9iVXdPVmxFSTI3My1NRVFyME02ZHZUMlFxM2xXVHVpcGptNzFMaGJlY1JVOU1Rd0NXQ1Q3OUhuSHc9PQ==

you made probably more in trading than most of us here but you shouldnt be too confident cause this might be your demise in trading where psychology and how you think is the most important part anyway the more you have the more you can lose of course its good to have so much money if you want to play safe but most of traders are probably sick gamblers especially at start because we seek to get rich quick but what we mostly get its just higher dopamine frustration and sometimes debts imo day trading is more for street than experienced traders because its always so well advertised which is kind of psychology trick its trick because most of ppl look for switching their ordinary job and whatever they do in it for comfortable sitting in the chair and make few daily trades they dont even think that this is not ordinary job they think that they should work by making trades daily but the more trades you do in the day the more you risk and mostly lose to sum up i wouldnt advise you day trading better stick in swing trading which work out for you already its better to do few trades in the week or even month but smart than few trades daily thinking that you are smart and if you are crypto trader like myself stick to trade bitcoin only and learn technical analysis altcoins are much better for investing never for tradingtoo risky and speculative good luck,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPQjNwNElTSHhHTU9YOWtKaXdqd1FGU21FSk1fa1ktc01LWXVUVDNZMFpLTUJsdjRUSnJXYk9oalpPcW55SVA3eVZvTmhhTEVZdlZtZExac2pHSk92N3c9PQ==

yo so look man best advice i can give is diversify your k you can legit learn to daytrade crypto with a <cur><number> account and run it up to ten bands while you get your sea legs and develop your trading strategy just make small positions and focus on having a thesis an entry and exit and an invalidation point where your thesis is incorrect you can cover your down payment on a house with a decent note using maybe a third of what you have and then continue earning money from your jobs to pay the mortgage which will likely be cheaper than renting and build your equity over time which is good for your credit and good for the opportunity cost of the remaining part of your stack id take most of whatever you have leftover and break it up into <number>yr investment plays that you really believe it obviously take profit on the way but one of the oldest sayings in trading is time in the market is always better than timing the market day trading is a suckers game youll make outrageous wealth investing in the cornerstones of our future global infrastructure but i still say you set aside <cur>k and then try your hand at running up a <cur><number> account it takes practice but if you are committed and you actually research as much as you can about daytrading you will absolutely be successful just remember that daytrading is your fun money real estate and investments are your wealth and your future good luck,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPdV9mVE1YQnBCWFhLRkhSOUVaU28waXhlNjEwRUJGOGw3bWp0WmF1OUpUd01qVnFRMUdOVWRQVXY0NTRxeU5lYU5oVTMxOXI4T09wRjg4S2ZYN3Z5S0E9PQ==

> however there are some other variables at play currently which is also causing a momentary disruption to the price that will always be true for any fiat currency any crypto currency any asset used as a store of value etc also the explanation i gave didnt mention hype which drives the price much higher than the posthalving supply shock and i didnt mention things like how the collapse of ftx or the repayment of mt gox coins has an effect on the market the world is not a simple place but too many simple people seek simple explanations and simple causes for what they mistakenly think are simple effects its always important to zoom out and see the bigger picture or if youre a fan of the west wing as jed bartlett would say see the whole board i was just explaining why it takes a period of months for the halving to have enough of an effect on the number of newly mined coins reaching the market to cause a posthalving bull run but heres the thing understanding the big picture stuff in this case the delayed effect of the halving what causes it can give you a better understanding of the cycle as a whole and it can serve as a guide for what to do in times of instability for example if the mt gox coins were hitting the market in <number> it would be an obvious reason to sell but theyre hitting the market in the period between the halving and the supply shock which means theyre adding a bit of a delay to when the supply shock will probably kick in since those mt gox coins and the german coins and others are adding to the supply during a time when the halving is decreasing it which means in my opinion buy buy buy and hold im all about the big picture,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPaml5X09GRGt6blUyUi1ZUlgya1ZNMW9QZkdibzdLdWMtOThxODR2cHZ4REJYaEZjc3RNOGhzTVl3c3pZbFA4Rldid2k5QXkzc3p5bDNKVkJ4Q19YZ2Y4WkkzbnN4TElBRllId0YyU2FTazg9

you probably know much more than me to be fair i thought consolidation is where the prices bounces around vague but fairly close top and bottom price levels due to market indecisiveness eg people buy and selling fairly evenly before theres either a trend where most are buying run or selling dip which sends the price in that direction substantially i think time has to be a bit of a factor if nothing else for whales to make more profit seems like prices have been gaining losing gaining losing around <number><number> this year this seems to reflect previous <number> year cycles so im thinking its nothing major and prices will start to jump up into a more extended run for a year or so germany us and mt gox potentially diluting the market might have an effect that will be interesting to see plus us fed and elections who knows again ill bow to your better judgement my friend im certainly not knowledgeable enough to be making decent money yet ,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPNV8zSlFLVTdEcDhzZzM1VW00NEN5anFfX0VUbmcwNWVvcGY0aXh2aDFSMUpDSnpQZENHcDFtSl9JV3RYQ0RkZjZ5eEs2LTlTeGhOTFNvRGo5bU5GdktxMlQtT000UDFIdXhtMHlUNkpWdms9

yes that the one its solid for scalping for regular trading i would recommend gmx you can trade limit order to buy and sell btc and eth and usdc and other tokens you can also swap trade and the main show is the perpetual futures contracts like you said youre not into using leverage untill you get comfortable gmx is the place to practice you can use like <number>x leverage or x so that you are not ever at risk of liquidation but like i said you can just stick to spot trading and use gmx to create your limit orders and such btw will f you trade a lot of volume like i do the rewards kick back are massive i got over <cur><number> just from fee kick backs between gains and gmx on one wallet thats with about <number> million in volume in a week,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZkdBNUZ0ZExuOXBYSE9yaTVPcVlpNGRiLWhwVXk1YW8tQTZ3Xy1VNXhERlZDalFoVEJoc296VEZKX3dXTVRhV0JxaUhua3RNM2Y5ZGNPNDJuUWh1dVFfangwdEhnWHBXZDdUQkZuUHg5SkU9

certainly not but in some sectors such as rwa you need as much regulation as possible if you want to bridge realworld assets to the digital space without oversight scams will run rampant and we are talking about assets potentially worth hundreds of millions memecoin rugs would look like pocket change in comparison,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQVTNxdDQ2cUlfV25MWW9famNhWTY0b2xyTGlSOHRiR21PYWdHLUlzRlFtX25FZ1M3ZExaWnZHNmdkSWc1MU4zR0JfUlRya1BKckF2ZWJhVHFuQm01MVNWaTVqcXhwOHFfNUhKY0NreFhvQ0E9

thats a good point but i think most regulation will be aimed toward centralized exchanges since i doubt large rwa holders will be willing to use defi for multimillion asset trading,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQN0JmMkgyTW1UVFRQQi1fNjE4TkJZWmVvN3l5RkhIbnBCTTE5Y1pOT01nYXNsMFpkTjhyM01MTE4ydlpXMzlUSElQRzVETGFuOGp2Nl9hQXVkRzV1bWFXSDZ5elE3S21ldDVuZnF5a0RmWm89
oh for sure most of the action will happen on centralized exchanges i only think that the ones that have the most diverse investing tools will take most of the market share for example multibank offers exposure to both crypto and tradfi and sophisticated investors want exposure to as many markets as possible,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQamZjWF9zb3pKcWlsMEZ1eGRIMm5DU0J4NThqNkZFVGRfWTA2R2Rqcmd5eWxLU2xiamVnYTNidlNhMnU1MHFmalFWVGdhZTlkTFlRc3dBcWhPMUJyU0RNNnBGMG40TkR0QTY1UEtrRnpJVEU9

from my point of view i dont do any trading but i heard that ocean predictoor helps people a lot my idea is to be in some projects at the best prices and in the long term and i collect some promising new ones through various campaigns tokens that i will receive as an airdrop when the token comes out for example im doing a galxe campaign on rivalz network right now because its the first intel layer ai and i think its going to be worth it,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQdllPNEloMUtYV0RUdldvSVFGWm5QNUZtNlNqQjlnbGRtMDZmRnJSR1p0ZDViUlVhaTdPbFF1ZUJlbDRrYkZha0RqcmlMSTlJbzF5MmgxMngxZzVSZEhkOVhYbkstZm5UT1NUZHB4Z2ViNlk9

for me the absolute most important thing is the fairness of the launch and tokenomics if a project has some apparent utility but there was a presalemine or any sort of investor funding or token allocation then im not interested more than anything the most appealing part of bitcoin was its fair launch principle too many projects in this space are unfairly distributed,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQUElQYnVrMFZLbEZkVk93cjBRbVdwMWhlU2NDQkptd1R2ajB1RkZFOElFTURKZnItMldrVVVXa05uQjN2Q0lseGpoWHJHbnYzOFI2a0tGblNIeV9McVE9PQ==

i do my analysis in this order how old is the project and what is its current market cap why does this project exist are there other projects that are trying to accomplish the same goal usually the answer is yes and so how is this project different is the project decentralized is it fair launched or was there a premine andor vc allocation what kind of consensus model does it use what are the pros and cons of the model does the community size make sense for how long it has existed do people care about this project if the project is successful in accomplishing its goals where would it reasonably end up in market cap and how long until it accomplishes those goals what does the historical price action look like for this project did it have one major spike and then has been flat since perhaps there has been a slow but steady uptrend there are a ton of different options but understanding the story of what caused price action direction in the past helps you understand where it could go in the future,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQQktLZUtYWUpjLVNGRDBCdlJEQ29zZlBSMS1ZQ0tvc2lIeDBuLTk5endTY0RMNUphWXVIdWctWWJia19OWk0tclZGQXRfbUFqc3M3ODYzRmNnQzUtR3dETlBUaVpaTDllU1dzYzhmdGc5cHM9

you seem really forgetful im not a fan of either but bidens policies have already spurred longterm economic activity for better and for worse for the common person and ultimately push the country in a better direction renewable energy semiconductors mining etc by incentivizing new innovative businesses to get started while still being able to cater to the wealthy trumps policies actively helped the rich get richer and didnt push our country in a good direction for the longterm imo watching out for big oil kneecapping any climate initiatives tax cuts for the wealthy etc which resulted in shortterm happiness for the common person but like a kid who plays on an ipad all day every day not realizing its because the parents just want to be able to ignore them it will crash and burn unless the people in charge are a little more proactive one microcosm example of how they may seem the same but are different is in how they are treating mining and manufacturing jobs both parties want them to be able to work but only one party is trying to get them to shift to industries that have the future in mind while the other one is trying to keep the unsustainable status quo the last thing i want is a party of yespeople who cater to the highest bidders at the expense of all of us our labor our livelihoods and the future generations i dont consider myself to be a d or r as a blanket statement but the difference between this admin and the last is so stark i cant believe people have forgotten so easily,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWG5KTzhMZmpjeHVLSkZ6cGM4YVBzS2gwRzNVM1ZTODNzSThJVUxIZjRQX3RicVN1bzNBd3ZmMnZGWHBXOWxoMzVqLTBpV1Z0X0tXY2llU1E4dlQ4My1Za1BWTEw3SldFVlZIZXZBTElaOXc9

you can use binanceus no problem binanceus does not offer futures trading though so idk why the hell you would use it for spot you cannot use the regular binance if you only have a us id it doesnt matter that you can bypass the ip address block with a vpn in order to trade with regular binance now you have to pass mandatory kyc and upload an id from pretty much any country besides the us then you can trade on binance they dont allow us ids for kyc if you have dual citizenship and have an id from another country you can use a vpn and upload that id from another country and use binance to recap you cannot use binance with a us id period binanceus only offers spot binance is practically no longer usable in the us as the sec and cftc have cracked down on exchanges recently and forced them to implement mandatory kyc when an exchange has mandatory kyc and isnt registeredlicensed with the sec and cftc for operation in the us that means us ids are banned from kyc and anyone with only a us id cannot use that exchange period ip address block negation with a vpn is no longer applicable since most exchanges have mandatory kyc to trade now and dont allow us ids for kyc i recommend the following exchanges for us customers btcc blofin bydfi and lbank btcc blofin and bydfi are all licensed for legal operation in the us by the sec and cftc and they actually allow us ids for kyc no problem lbank is usable in the us at the moment simply because they dont have mandatory kyc yet i highly recommend btcc they have x leverage available for max degening only <number> maker fees for limit orders <number> taker fees for market orders they have demopaper trading the best way to practice and learn futures trading with no risk the downsides of btcc are they have a <cur><number> deposit minimum which is annoying and dont offer isolated margin only cross mildly annoying isolated margin can be negated by using stop loss i personally am insane and dont like using either take profit or stop loss i prefer to close my position manually when i am content with the profit i hate being taken out of my position by tpsl,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdlE2LUh3Q1pHUVBzOWpxOXBrNWkwX004dHRmVXdwb1RYQVNUX29tQk8tc19tRXQ2NzZ1OUktNWRJS2xZOE11ckR3SUIwTDFpYVNvQjZwWXNUNDllRkpQQVZPUVBnUU1ZUjJJRS03S2ppajg9

honestly screw hardware wallets if your device breaks in the future you may lose all your crypto also hardware wallets have limited storage space so you cant have that much diversity in your portfolio your diversity will be severely limited by the storage space on the hardware wallet hardware wallets also have absurdly high fees and often dont have a debit card you can get to spend the funds on there i have a ledger but never use it because <number> the fees to buysellsendreceive are absurdly high <number> i cannot have much diversity with the limited storage space <number> if it breaks im screwed <number> i cannot spend the funds on there since the bastards are taking years to send debit cards to the us and probably will never i cannot speak for trezor but if they are like ledger which they probably are stay away use coinbase and pay the <cur><number>month subscription for coinbase one then you get <cur><number>month free trading volume with no fees and a physical debit card unlimited diversity and dont have to worry about a device breaking all these parrots who repeat not your keys not your crypto are underinformed idiots who just repeat what they hear like a parrot with a pea sized parrot brain,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbG95MmlvNzRSd2FGTEcyNTVaMWxkc1BpdDJqWGk5MVlOTjVsU2NwbXZCTUtFalZUWFhUMXgxc3ZCY2Q1X2MtTHR5R25rcng3V1QyZkFneG9qN1gyZVBieGZROEtOOVdWM1N3MDUzMEdoLWc9

yeah its not super simple but it gets pretty easy once your head is wrapped around the concepts for cross chain swapping i like squidrouter gas is a fractional amount of eth or whatever the utility token on the chain your using is being spent to pay the block validators to add your transaction to the blockchain you can pay lower or even no fees if you want but its possible your transaction just sits in the mem pool and never gets confirmed gas is you paying for the miners to include your transaction in the next block they find miners are gonna fill their blocks with the most high paying transactions so during times of high transaction volume it becomes a bidding war for fees to get included as soon as possible thats why gas fees can get so pricy sometimes,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYklsdVNZYnlfQk5vTFh2UUo4T1lJby1hbzBXcnA3Qk9KTHptTFRXeHJpVXZYSkNWNnNLRDdYckhNWjRKdVFoMVo4SG9xcEFReVFaSGwyT1MzQUF0MVJXWkl2X3hhY0dndmdCLWVHT0ZCYnc9

the technical levels are mostly just the how part of price movement the why is mostly about institutional intent which is driven by market sentiment and corporate balance sheets why does a market consolidate and trade in a range well some large companies own a bunch of inventory and their entire business model is to buy that inventory at a discount and sell it at a premium they sell until the buyers dry up wait for them to come back in and drive the price up then they sell more and they repeat that until they have finished selling the inventory they intended to sell simple as that,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdGg0SUdRNWdyZWxVMVhVdmZBWC1fLU9TWFlxZFlFYmp3OF9Pb0lHUE1MY3k3cUJmM2xWOFQ0ZW5wWXl2NmJ6RVVkT0dmT3cwcS1zY1p3ZFFvY2lsb2dVZXowY2EzTTVnV1RHdU1US2Y3MTQ9

people finally catching on that all of crypto apart from btc is a rug pull made to make the owners rich best example is xrp btc is highly sought after because of decentralization and the finite supply of coins means that as the demand grows so will the price all other cryptos are premines and they can simply add more coins and flood the market any time they choose eth started with a premine and the rest was mined later for example but knowing that would you feel as safe in your investment as you did before this is similar to money printing and what we have now he can create tokens out of thin air premine and increase the supply,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNab0oxd0JNVWF1amJWbTR4RnZXOUZrTzA3bmQzejZNckJreE9hRmxwcU5YME5qakR5ZXpVbXRNRnB1SjkydWU4OFR4UzF0UGt1allnNUdHRzlwbjdtbzBSQlBOZUZiRTdPN1VHVFFCQVpveXM9

high interest rate environment causes a bias towards higher quality assets high risk assets tend to run when rates are cut a counter intuitive crash occurs and deliberate money supply expansion flows into speculative assets people that previously purchased winning assets start feeling wealthier as the money supply expands and increases the asset values they own when those people feel wealthier they can trim positions into more speculative assets,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTFZEcXYyU3FKbWRPdnhLOTZ6XzdlVzRqTVg2V1lDaEhaS2Y5THJLWUxTUGJXZncxWnRKeFAtbUcxanpYcVpWR1J5YjVRSDVyd2Ixc0JfaDJUMHhoY2c9PQ==

creating a crypto is easy selling crypto is easy but theres a lot of steps in between both for rug pullers and for responsible folk you can create a new coin in <number> minutes using existing templates but then you need to gift some of it to yourself into your own wallet not an exchange but your wallet then you need to convince <number> or <number> or a million people to buy this coin if they dont the price doesnt go up right and they can buy it from you but if not you need to get it listed on exchanges in order for them to buy any so you have to convince coinbase or binance or kraken or any other exchange that this is legit but in order to get listed on their exchange they will want a cut either a percentage or an upfront fee so you send them a million shitcoins just to be able to sell your other billion shitcoins now youre in an open market but no one knows who the hell you are or what the hell this coin is for so you need to make up a story and build a website you need to market and post on reddit and build a fanbase once youve done all that you still need to get lucky but if you do people will buy and the price will go up then and only then can you dump on unsuspecting idiots who fell into your trap lots of fucking steps and work involved just buy coins even shitcoins if you have to but stick to legitimate ones and when they go up sell them its not rocket surgery,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTTJFMHZvc2xSdjlkaXF6SFowd0YyNDRMOUxUMWdWTHNXMEM3bU1NUU8tSmdGUmFPbXQzNS1VRHFWMnhBbGltbm9tTmJUb3N4YWZObzNxSXdZNFVVWHNidnQtTXlIeXlaMnoxNHRwdmZrZW89

focus on the hopeful bull market first what you make or dont make in this market can effect what you choose to do with your money going forward otherwise max out your ira each year next time around youll still at least be able to pick up btc and eth inside an ira you can be avoiding a lot of taxes that way particularly so if capital gains taxes are increased in the future which wouldnt surprise me at all theres also cryptobased iras where you can trade a lot more than those two you can also max out your k contributions each year and if you dont mind the capital gains you can always just put whatever money into a traditional brokerage account and hope for your <number><number> while you bide your time to put it in crypto again and if you do make good money this time around it would be wise to spread it around a little anyway instead of putting a single large amount on any one asset class im not one to normally sing the praises of diversification but it would be wise with crypto considering how many people got rekt last time around in ftx and luna and celsius im sure well discover our next round of crooks next crash ill be putting a bunch into stable dividends maybe annuities and generally the most boring unexciting investments one can think of theres a big value to stable income streams particularly as we get older,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR0w0YXBWOFBxVmJKY1c0cmc2WkYtQlRhaXl5MTlZVThlN3k5QUZQN29TM01JZXhHQ3Z0OUR0UnZYR3pjRWhFRG1hSHRTM3NuZzVrSzdUdlUzNTZkRnc9PQ==

no more that an assets volatility or lack thereof largely dictates how you should treat itwhether you should hold it forever or sell it the next day and anything in between bitcoin loses about <number> of its value in every bear down market so why continue to hold an asset if its going to be that volatile something like that is better for tradingholding until youve made a profit and selling when you feel its too inflated and there isnt much more to go up then let it tumble and if you still believe in the asset buying it again when its down if we move to the stock market warren buffet has owned coke for i dont know how many decades its one of those companies which sure wont make you rich overnight but through the years its been a consistent winner one of those stocks you buy and forget you even own it and then maybe check it out again when you retire it doesnt have much volatility it would be absolutely correct to say that you can pick any fouryear period in bitcoins history and it would be in profit but buy btc at <cur>k where it was at three years ago and hold until now and youd be <cur>k yet but sell at <cur><number> and buy back at <cur><number> and youd sure be happy now granted thats not to say anyone can time the market perfectly and i say focus on the bigger ticket cryptos if you have plans on holding for a long time as you seemed to suggest you would because many if not most of those bottomfeeder tokens just wont be around at all for the next bull run five years from now if youre looking at monthly buys look up dollar cost averaging,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnblZQQTZyLWV3TTF5VHkzd2xTd2tSbC1PbC1ZX1dVMVZWbUxrVC1wTTZvdVRJYUhYX1dDa0tWLXV0QllsdGdLMkd2SGkzUUczclZVNTR5NUt1T3ltR3c9PQ==
