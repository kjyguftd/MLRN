>astroturf data as a form of protection i dont hate this idea but those who would use this data against others would likely have a easy time validating the authenticity because location correlation isnt difficult think about it this way if you were to say change the cell ids to random values well it would be impossible for a device to be in california with one record then appear on a cell site in new york just <number> minutes later so for it to be any kind of effective youd need to map all cell ids and then put some logic in there for reasonable travel time without making obvious pattern of life changes it would be quite the undertaking even shifting identification values wouldnt work because attribution is also easy to determine so the data would just appear fake and the real copy would be obviously real,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbmcxeUVzU3pPRHI1ZjEzaVlsR0t2SWZpZUtkWXNEQmFuQzBodUF3VGJmZ0Z0YzJfeW5FdVJ0MnNPMTJwOS1IRjFsVkpwU0staDVBZHF6VncwLVJfSWc9PQ==

if you build an environment and it grows organically stuff like this happens very easily you purchase a new tool this can only integrate with x but is not compatible with y and so on its not surprising that you struggle with this i have two suggestions document everything you can in a central place if you have to put research and effort into an issue you should document it if something similar happens you can go back kiss keep it stupid simple you environment seems complex and maybe it makes sense to reevaluate some of the solutions tools you use maybe you have the potential to get rid of some of them and reduced complexity results in less effort to track down issues and maybe even saves you lots of money longterm option two is youre just stupid but the fact that you have impostor syndrome is a sign that youre a smart guy so i guess its not that,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUXdlQV95TzAxLXNpdUozTHIzV1haT1o4d1JtVlRTOXpBR2Z6SDI0WGpBN1JYQ3VwU01FeEpoeG12SlVoVXlTa2pZU1Z5aEdfQVpiSTd2bHVxR3VmOFE9PQ==

i think hefty fines im talking high percentages of total revenue are the only thing that will truly convince ceos to make prevention a priority with how many data breaches have happened in the last few years i think theres less of a concern about prevention they happen with such frequency that consumers are left to just accept it as a part of life and take their own preventive actions like freezing their credit with all three credit bureaus if everyone was hacked no one was hacked essentially putting on my conspiratorial hat its almost like there was a deliberate effort among ceoscisos to allow lax security practices so that the proverbial bandaid could be ripped off and consumers dont have anywhere to turn because everyone was comprised in one way or another it turns infosec into more of a reactive prdamage control effort than a proactive prevention and deterrence effort is it better to spend <cur><number> million once random number to do damage control or spend <cur><number> million annually to have a properly staffed cyber security department again conspiratorial whats more likely is that people dont know what theyre doing and implement insecure architecturecode without realizing it especially as more companies move to cloud service providers this case in particular is especially insidious though if hackers got a hold of call logs locations the contents of texts etc i think heads are going to roll it also makes me wonder if imessage messages were exposed in theory those are supposed to be encrypted at rest and in transit unlike sms so if service providers like att had access to them thats a major issue both with imessage as a secure messaging platform and public trust with att storing supposedly encryptedsecure messages,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeXdoeXQ4a1ZUako4dWpLV1J4YXhNTzJCbGVpd1RQY1h0SElNVVBJNXRieGNIekVlSEJvTTBXZm03NFJENFB0eXRlRVEzZU52dHIyX19VYlFLeG52RUE9PQ==

hi everyone im currently in cybersecurity have been working in it for slightly more than <number> years while doing my masters degree from a top <number> cybersecurity school on the side ive learned about this industry in multiple ways and have become slightly disillusioned it seems that a lot of it is just boring and boring it especially maybe it is just a function of being in my particular employer but im starting to doubt that i can do this for the next <number> years to be blunt = im miserable investigate phishing email this crunch a security alert this consult on some tool that do some adjustment of configurations monitor your network adjust the firewalls push some paperwork pass an audit i feel that my brain is rotting i also would like to note that i can type code like a software engineer since ive been doing it since age <number> but computer science people who just type ifelse and are programmers are oversaturating that field as well besides just generic software development isnt as interesting nor as specialized then there is the automation issue we are seeing an increased reliance on automation of alerting tools and capabilities in this space and organizations have been moving more and more functionality to the cloud yes i understand that cloud isnt a silver bullet especially cloud spend with regards to having onpremise servers as things get more and more moved towards the cloud then with the new introduction of automated software tools and now ai it seems that more and more of the functionality will be taken away from end cybersecurity analysts engineers then added into that in the private sector there is massive outsourcing of it and security functionality i see for example socs being nearshored in places like costa rica and security engineering colocated for companies in india i also am currently in the public sector and it doesnt appeal to me work culture lack of advancement etc so im trying to determine the next career steps and even flirted with the thought of quitting the security industry entirely for greener pastures wanted to ask you all if you have any ideas for potential next steps both cybersecurity and noncybersecurity related i hope that whatever step i do next is mentally engaging i feel that my brain is rotting thanks in advance,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMlRqOWhzV1lJSkItVUNwWEhaT0kxd3pQZXNzVlJhZURobDlrRmxJcXFUOThuNF8xRUlwODhqczlNNDZseUpoeXRVLTFZVWFUcWpOYlpIOU5xSFZUOFE9PQ==

realworld organisations should have multiple overlapping controls this makes it hard to test any single control its ok to disable or compromise another control in order to allow a good test especially if its targeted in a way that just lets the tester in no other threat actors no biggie whitelisting an ip address is a very common example but think of it another way if an organisation gives a pentester a badge to go onsite and lets them access a rack in order to test some device in the rack even though the tester isnt a member of their wintel engineering team the organisation has just compromised their physical access controls right if it was a truly blackbox test they wouldnt have got past the reception desk or the boundary fence this is super common in pentesting its ubiquitous every week i issue credentials to a tester or a cert or a key or send them the secret url or whitelist some ips maybe share our confidential architecture diagrams or a db schema all this helps allow a more effective test of controls the platonic ideal of a black box test is for teenagers on reddit,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN3RFRzNoMGRJdjNiQUgxN2ZKeGRoLWRVVnFSazZLSFRqQ0JxOTlpTTAtNXhpZlRpMHlJYnZVQkZud2Ntd3VvUkpEQWdhUE81OW1kUEpLaDRkbEw3bW9IdFB1dVo3NmtNNnAzZ3NEUzYzLW89

my take as someone who has shadowed a pentesting organization most proficient pentesters will perform a holistic approach from an external threat actor this way detailing lapses in your security control and needed policies or actions to strengthen them and if none is found then thats a good thing for your business then they might recommend to you the need to let them perform actual pentesting on the application or web service itself which at this time whitelisting the specific user ip address with associated mac address of device can be done to allow for the pentester workflow but also remember its a recommended practice to not use same vendor twice in <number> years,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZS3hldjdRbnAzRXFiaVR2LTdHRks5eVlBNlZ0cEFWVWJaclRYRnlFck5yZWUySVhfbmNCd2NmbHN6dVU5SDBwTFZVak42ZjlxN2hBakJKeGN3dzVaZmc9PQ==

this is a very good question i dont know the <number> solution to this but in a server environment when we know exactly what a server is supposed to do we usually have dtrace scripts running that watches which process have been executed who executed them who forked them which files they opened etc the data then is fed into a logging system that monitors these actions and alerts as needed this would be hard but not impossible to implement for a desktop environment but very easy for a server environment if you know exactly what the server is supposed to do luckily dtrace now is part of windows and we dont need to install it manually anymore,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZFljRGxReFd4bVNsVklHTjRoTEtzdEZxTzRIdDFJTWJXNlR3OXVEcTBKNDV6NWxtLXJyQXVvR0ZUd2RObTJJbFpvQVo2QWR4cWFhbEpFSzJxZ3Bqd0E9PQ==

<number> this is all about managing relationshipssoft skills and seeing and you work in teams and overcoming problems id say id sit down with the other individual and go through how we got to each of our conclusions and try to understand each others point of view give an example about how drawing a <number> on the floor looks like a <number> to me but a <number> to someone standing opposite me we are both right yet appear wrong to each other <number> to this there is no right or wrong answer here anyone who says data in transit or data at rest without more information or an understanding of the risk doesnt understand this question you need to link this to risk and the interviewer is trying to see if you have this understanding you need to understand whats your bigger risk and address that give a very high level example of data being stored in a physical location say a room and you have physical control of that location say a secure room storing this unencrypted could be seen as less of a risk than unencrypted data that traverses the open internet in this case i would prioritise protecting data in transit as this is where my biggest risk sits the opposite example would be a situation where data only transits a network within a physical controlled office and is then stored on hard drives these hard drives are taken off site and stored by a third party this would be an example where i would prioritise protecting stored data because i see this as my bigger risk yes theres far more information you need in a real situation but this what the interviewer is after link to risk <number> id say humans but we must also caveat this humans are also our biggest strength good organisations are starting to try and change the negative attitude of humans being the weak link which we can be to humans being a strength or even a saviour at times weve all heard cases where a potentially catastrophic incident was averted because an admin or user noticed something was up and felt confident and empowered to report it yet all we like to bang on about is users making mistakes companies dont want people who are all doom a gloom and bang the drum of humans being idiots companies want people who understand humans their tendencies and help reduce the opportunity for a human to make a mistake whilst championing what we do well,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNUMzNXV4MmV5aWNQblpwUm8tUW9lTnhhWE9wOHowby1vbUlnVzRtcDVMN20zSlFNYmc0anI4emozSThicWR5M2s4cTY4bWYtSlA5TzkzUG50Ti1qaEE9PQ==

the first one i would preface by saying im humble enough to very rarely be <number> certain about any hypothesis id talk it through with the other party and possibly engage others to see if we could resolve the points we disagree on assuming we are talking about a security matter i would expect it to progress through the organisations risk assessment process and the risk owner would have the ultimate say my responsibility is to support the risk owner in making an informed decision and my ego doesnt come into it second one the criticalitysensitivity of the data matters more than its state that being equal though probably data at rest because of the volume data at rest potentially encompasses the entirety of our data whereas data in transit is only a subset third one humans are the weakest link however it is dangerous to focus too much on securing one areaelement as that means you will neglect others and attackers will exploit your weaknesses where they find them better to adopt an effective defense in depth strategy coupled with zero trust to mitigate the human risk as much as possible,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQnJrTnFNR1FXM3VCUDVJd05uXzRDVkc3MDRyX29neWs1by1YUDFDZEJyMVhmVzFHRkp2ZGNXbV9CUllObHBhdlNhd1JRc0FJbmdKeC1hM3Z1R05Cdm96MnR5U2ZLM0V4SmQtSk4zaTg5RmM9

i got a job straight out of university <number>+ years ago im in the uk and think the job market is a bit different here compared to the us hack the box try hack me and portswigger academy are good places to learn the practical skills in general you need to have a decent understanding of the fundamentals of networking and general application stuff such as the various languages how a web server works what a database is etc plus some understanding of how to go about hacking those things in terms of certs i think oscp is well regarded in terms of technical abilities but im not sure if just having that and no experience is enough in the us for somebody getting into the field id make sure youre good on the technical stuff but also be able to communicate well in writing and verbally a large part of a pen test is conveying what you did and found to the key stakeholders so being able to produce written technical documentation and articulate your points well in meetings is an invaluable skill to have on that point make sure the spelling and grammar on your cvresume is flawless and that its presented well it should also sell your knowledge and experience in it and cyber id also suggest that you practice interviewing if you can my universitys careers team offered mock interviews with really helpful feedback which was good for getting a feel for interviews i think by about the rd or th real interview i was then able to present myself well enough to get the job,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabFh1VkZMTzVRRmQ4S0tXUTFQUXg0SUVrOTVETjNEWnBpTjN6UzhVSF9tR0pvT25fWGs1dlpmcWptaG00ZDZoWHBtbXVVSzFSNDdMd2JlRXBBcENOOFFsd0ZNanJnaG9nRHh5N0tfeFB3d0U9

hi everyone im currently in cybersecurity have been working in it for slightly more than <number> years while doing my masters degree from a top <number> cybersecurity school on the side ive learned about this industry in multiple ways and have become slightly disillusioned it seems that a lot of it is just boring and boring it especially maybe it is just a function of being in my particular employer but im starting to doubt that i can do this for the next <number> years to be blunt = im miserable investigate phishing email this crunch a security alert this consult on some tool that do some adjustment of configurations monitor your network adjust the firewalls push some paperwork pass an audit i feel that my brain is rotting i also would like to note that i can type code like a software engineer since ive been doing it since age <number> but computer science people who just type ifelse and are programmers are oversaturating that field as well besides just generic software development isnt as interesting nor as specialized then there is the automation issue we are seeing an increased reliance on automation of alerting tools and capabilities in this space and organizations have been moving more and more functionality to the cloud yes i understand that cloud isnt a silver bullet especially cloud spend with regards to having onpremise servers as things get more and more moved towards the cloud then with the new introduction of automated software tools and now ai it seems that more and more of the functionality will be taken away from end cybersecurity analysts engineers then added into that in the private sector there is massive outsourcing of it and security functionality i see for example socs being nearshored in places like costa rica and security engineering colocated for companies in india i also am currently in the public sector and it doesnt appeal to me work culture lack of advancement etc so im trying to determine the next career steps and even flirted with the thought of quitting the security industry entirely for greener pastures wanted to ask you all if you have any ideas for potential next steps both cybersecurity and noncybersecurity related i hope that whatever step i do next is mentally engaging i feel that my brain is rotting thanks in advance,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU29nWVhhd0hnSUR4cjhmY20wX1VlVGxQUDB3Q2MxUG95S3Q5WGxWeHhTZHUzam9vOGZaZWpyOGVyd2hQem0xYlNSajdfWFBFUlB3Z0FyWWxQNkRJQ0E9PQ==

you are not wrong but neither is your boss you can certainly integrate everything into your centralized sso environment there are benefits to doing so such as having a single policy enforcement point the critical step is to ensure that administrative accounts and administrative systems are configured to not have an sso experience admins and those with access to admin apps should encounter mfa at every authentication instead of have transparent sso occurring that mfa will be a pita but that is solved by also requiring fido devicebound passkeys to achieve stronger mfa strength making is t phishing resistant while also simplifying the login experience with a fingerprint fido key the admin just needs to touch the continue button ie put the finger on the finger print reader,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndzZKTFZSMjhHU2t6R3dXcTYzTm54ZnhEcmh2dnBiM3lVbHNuc2tWLU1oak92b2lDQWxXbzFSNldMbUJWN1dTOVZneV9fMEx4UVJhUnhDUzc1TFRQSlE9PQ==

i finished mine not too long ago with my degree as a cum laude student and have my security + so far i personally think you should start applying already even if you dont feel confident that you qualify the competition is horrible rn and the reality is that its going to take some time to get into the field you may have to start as it help desk and work your way up im even considering to join the navy to jump start my career since the military look for those skills at the moment and will train you network as early as you can and do internships even if theyre volunteering at the moment experience from work matters over certs from what im seeing most applications would state that security + is desired or a plus in entry level jobs education will only get you so far and its the experience that completes it its crazy as there are not many willing to train incoming graduates for entry level just food for thought an entry level help desk will ask <number><number> years from a previous help desk role like wtf dont let it get to you because you can do it just like others have shared their own stories if you really want it and work hard for it you can make it happen getting the first job is the hardest part if you dont have people to get you in maintain your knowledge apply everyday work on projects like on hack the box do home labs get out there and network prepare to do jobs you may not want keep up with technology and never lose sight on your goals its all possible but its not as easy as it would have been <number> years ago with covid just hope you realize it and start seeing if there are plenty of jobs in your area or if you have to move a lot of things to consider and i really hope for the best for you,r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRi11cU5Ec2NoOWNHOWlVMHNObVVJaHNXWk5oYjJsaFVTT3phdmc2aWR4VnltUzFNajRsSU5XdzlaakJVdlBCbG13OGZseUVpVXUyVGQtSF9zVG5seVE9PQ==
