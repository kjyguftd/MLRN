i agree with imaginarybar that this is certainly a problem in queuing theory and scheduling theory this is they said a solved problem in the sense that these kinds of problems are extremely well studied and there are very many toolboxes already designed for them the difficulty is going to be in mapping out the exact structure of your problem so that you can design an appropriate simulation,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbm9nTEFJX2lDczlvRDR4bWx1VWhwR1NYVkdiTE9tZkRTT3Y4ME5sbzgtREp3SFl1VjBndmhadXNHZTJtWFJDdmNzMDBZem90R1RLUEYtd2R6dmp5VXc9PQ==
i think it depends on what level you are i think there are much more valuable skills than learning how to implement everything from scratch also you are not expected to build extremely advanced solutions until later in your career you are required to have a solid understanding of the basics as a junior things that i consider more valuable are knowing how and when to use each algorithm knowing plenty techniques for feature engineering always seeking business knowledge knowing how implement and deploy models to production like clouddatabricks and all that and being a person that is always keeping up with new advancements for me these are much more valuable and will take you further and faster to a higher position after having more knowledge and experience knowing the ins and outs of algos becomes more valuable as well and youll have the maturity and skills to decide when to go for something more sophisticated or customized or not there was a similar discussion to this a while back between a spending years studying then seeking professional experience or b going to the job market asap and learning while doing a very famous data scientist that i dont recall the name was saying that option b was much better for a data scientists career as experience is equally or even more important than academicin depth knowledge,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNE5lX09hZzlsTkhNYUhRSUFMXy1lcE1DY0lFQWdNNENZclhrendGemtkb21kaHRadFJsV3p6WTlVRE1JdkpEQ1hNNGtaYlFXNzBYTm9QVDU2N2p6S3c9PQ==

need to talk to the analyst team manager to set expectations around roles and responsibilities if its your role to pull data for every analyst request then you need to formulate an intake process and even hire more people have seen this sort of dependence at one of the places where the analyst team was basically lazy and getting away with it because their director was powerful and a bully eventually they did hire analysts with sql skills to help their senior analysts to get the data to them and a few years later every analyst was pulling their own data so things changed overtime,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTelVaRmhyNmptZldvME95VTRrMTdtRXp4OFEzeXVvSGt6VnhZUVhfcEpfOFlFaGhYZmU3X3YwbDhQNkJlSmFscG02LWRGbHlGcEVPNWJyS0lIRHZOVUE9PQ==

in my opinion hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data the process begins with formulating two hypotheses the null hypothesis h which represents no effect or status quo and the alternative hypothesis h which indicates the presence of an effect or difference the testing involves collecting data and calculating a test statistic which is then compared against a critical value to determine the pvalue if the pvalue is less than the significance level typically <number> we reject the null hypothesis suggesting that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis hypothesis testing is crucial in research and data analysis for making informed decisions based on empirical data,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTT29qMnB3NTN6N0VSQ1Z2cUltS3M2M0VkbklVM3NnMkZWd3o2c2s5MGFXVGlEX0FJcGtZS3ZXWGR4VmJEUFZkZkhMcjhsOExFQlA2dldiaU5iaFhkYUE9PQ==

agree with udfphd on the standard for ics being higher than for managers in terms of how to be twice as effective the typical model is someone who is a specialist often through a phd but another model that ive found effective and perhaps more achievable is when a teammate is good if not the best at two things in my work thats been someone who was an excellent applied scientist as well as excellent ml engineer she was able to understand the latest models and also understand how to scale them to deliver results reliably even though she was an ic she had an outsized influence on the team by creating standards and best practices that she persuaded everyone to follow my manager called her an hshaped person excellent in two domains and crucially could connect the two,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNTgxUEdXelZoSDhsd19Ea3R4R3NlcW03VEpMbVJaQmF3Ri1Zcjc3cjlUR3dyaGlNeUtlSkY2UUI3TG5KV0V0cVF0TkVaZTdyU3BDM2xNYWpJMS0tWEhvTDJWWlI1bDlmM0E1X1g5UXVYcHM9

ive done some work in sales in the past its very different from marketing the key kpi was production to a goal sliced different ways depending on what we were looking at theres a lot of data sciencetype work that can be done depending on the sort of sales youre working with goal setting requires some data science and it can be used for deployment too propensity to book scoring leads in some way identifying priority accountsleads and streamlining the sales process are all helpful sales people can be challenging when it comes to data some are great but others dont like the data interfering with their process or just dont understand it im overgeneralizing sales people but a lot of them went into sales because they liked working with people more than they liked working with stuff and they tend to not be super patient about learning so they can be challenging stakeholders theyre a lot of fun at conferences though,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN3Joc0pRTW95U2RqeG5aamNYMlpnUlYtd0hSSXozdmhiVmNRUjFMSFpWN0pfaWczVkYyZjlwc19TRGxoYVUyZndrM3BqbjZFWDNyZjRCNzFjUThRVUl6eUNXek4za28zTmdtRHFuZ2laY0U9

im a data analyst but i work closely with the ds on our sales analytics team for a big finance firm a lot of it ends up being tracking descriptive analytics ie how many calls number of new clients assets received ect however we also do a lot of predictive analytics to see which descriptive stats end up being the best predictors of a successful sale we also look at client behavior data to try to pin point our existing clients that can be targeted for consolidation or or cross sold additional products we also have a lot of cross over with marketing analytics,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVnhoS2NVZHkyRFRhQ3JkalV6azVlbTZ4d0J0ZDd4MmdGQjV4NXZsZ1lEZlNJLVR0d2JScDFtQnNVVkJHUmdFU01mVXVnS3ZwWVhpeDRGVkNIa2NuNkE9PQ==

honestly does anyone else just feel kind of hopeless about the job market i graduated in may <number> with a ms in statistics and have a bs in math i just passed the one year anniversary of my graduation and am at about <number> job applications and it really feels essentially impossible just to even get noticed from those applications ive only gotten a handful of initial recruiter calls or preliminary coding tests and only been through the interview process for data scientist roles at two companies each of which are extremely wellknown and wellrespected companies and i made it through <number>+ rounds of interviews at each company i got exceptional feedback saying that i was a perfect cultural fit at each and did great in the interviews as well as had interviewers tell me how impressive my personal projects were one of those companies even flew me across the country to their headquarters for the final interview to meet the team ultimately though i was told i was the second choice for the role at each company i feel like ive taken all the general advice and done everything that youre supposed to ive done personal projects to make up for being a fresh grad ive networked ive finetuned my resume to satisfy ats bots etc ive had multiple highlevel ds managers that i know through networking or being hiring managers i interviewed with tell me my resume looks great and that i would have no trouble getting a job in data science if it werent for the current job market i also apply to essentially any job quasi related to ds or statistics data scientist data analyst bi analyst statistician decision scientist any kind of analyst etc im also in the us and have no visabased restrictions meanwhile i seem to see people all the time from nonstem backgrounds doing online data science boot camps and getting jobs right away i guess this is more of a way to vent than anything but damn is anyone else in a similar situation has anyone gone through this and finally gotten a job at the end will the market ever improve or should i just go be a math teacher,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRl85a2hhcVF2Qmd2X1VDVWtKUkt0REp4S2o4eWdZdGU5TVBfWkd0VTk0QnpILUhaaHNMR0xkRDdNc3dmMXRNaDZpejg4cFEyM0trZ3AxSmtmcS1HM2c9PQ==

sure the biggest challenge ive seen is missing the context around what theyre doing it usually manifests in a few ways <number> missing the real question thats being asked we usually get asked the immediate question and the real question is much more complicated and buried somewhere underneath it what is driving the change to projections this quarter might well mean i dont feel like i have enough visibility into my business <number> not tying work to incentives of the stakeholders aka not explaining how the model is going to make or save the business money a lot of data scientists think this part is selfexplanatory but to people who arent neck deep in data its often not <number> missing the real stakeholders often the end user of your product isnt the person youre presenting the work to if we dont understand who is going to be actually using the output of our work we cant design it in a way that helps them and even if it gets deployed it wont be used to its potential and someone will come back to us and blame us for developing a poor product <number> not articulating a path to production a lot of good models fail here because theyre hard or impractical to operationalize i once worked with a team who had a model that took <number> hours to run and ran every day the easy to say hard to do solution is to think through the project from concept to delivery and think about the stuff we dont normally think about what the real question is and how the solution is going to be delivered theres more to unpack than that but those are some themes,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeDNYUHNYYWxiOG91cklES0MzS2pWNmx4eHFsbktfUXVLVkZMZ0lSVE9xS3RWOWZCRTVEMUQwQmk5WmVpY2d1NU5JU01sT1BvSmc1ZEZqYXFJcjREV1hOOE5OU3g3MnoxelNiN2ZVVjJOYWs9

easy way to practice is writing up a document communicating the project youre working on turn it into a living memo <number><number> pages with an outline including the background on why its important to the team company a discussion and analysis section talking through results and then a next steps follow up items use it as a chance to work on your writing style clarity slide building is substantially easier than writing a memo that gets the point across and will be easier to pickup once youve learned how to structure your thoughts and communicate with writing,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSVBJb0RkYS1XbUVYUnVkQmk2LTF5UHlPaWZHNVQwQUVBSXBDREh0Sk1HbG55Q1ZjT0RqR0dwZXhZWEVuVUlpUWxCVmkwT3ZKaTFqdmpvWTRaZXgweWc9PQ==

you can still practice some of the skills youd need help frame up the presentations youre doing and look at what is changed you can ask for exposure to that sort of thing even if they dont want you to make the decks listen to the questions they ask and frame conversations so youre answering the questions they have before they ask them the best advice i got was to anticipate the questions i was going to be asked before i got them its also worth talking to people outside the team if you push yourself out of your comfort zone a little youll find it gets more comfortable you dont have to be a social butterfly but youll learn about how other teams work and make connections within the organization making things happen in a big organization is a lot about maintaining your network and knowing who to ask theres some random advice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTE1tLVJRb0JUZzNhQlk3OEFjM2tFTWg4TnQweE0za0RtVHVHby1BUGg0M3plX0czVl9JOGVrMHVCYXlJcHQ4N2gtX3hvV1NMeF9CdDl1Zk1RclJKRVNvYUdEMWtNbDEzT3FQb01iSXRrX1U9

i think the best course of action for a data scientist is to attend conferences and find mentors in their field in their local area sure some general coaching could help them but honestly teaching in a vacuum isnt very helpful they need to find contacts in their field and in their local community to learn from already working on projects that they care about,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMXg0clBZb2lrSnV4cWlkYTd5cWFmZEgtMHp5X0c4UVJhaWp4MEt3T0FXMTQwRlk4c05mRU9oVzI0NDQ2UXc5Zjd1REFtd0JzZjMxSG1xYlFONGxKWkE9PQ==

despite a very strong resume i think the problem is that your background is strong for data analytics but not data science a lot of hiring managers might just be looking for more technical individuals and your resume kind of says technical ish with great business qualifications some small red flags include listing both pytorch and tensorflow without mentioning how you used them same with aws and google cloud how did you use those pivot tables arent great to have on a ds resume great for da plus mentioning log loss specifically instead of talking about what you were actually trying to minimize tbh if you want a ds role i think your best option is to grind out another year of da and try to move towards more technical projects,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMVFQSWR3cHlnRkM3QkhXblB4SFd1WmRTbEVyOG1sOC1kMF9iQ0FMNU5XM1phcGREM3ZGd0N3eWFFNndtMTB5M2sweEp2UzY5LXRvbWo5cndfTlo3ZEE9PQ==

the phrase data champion is definitely corporate speak and more than likely from a non technical person no selfrespecting developer etc would ever call themselves that unless it was satire it sounds like they want a senior dev type person to lead but maybe not manage a team of folks whom monitor power bi reportsdashboards and then act on that in some capacity something you should definitely find out the details on is it an industry or company youd like to work in but in a different role the extra pay sounds nice though you need to weigh other options like this is probably a largely deadend role where youll likely end up being a power bi developer so if you want to work there then maybe take the extra pay and start watching the internal job postings for something you do want but youll need to stay where you are for probably <number>yrs,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUT1h5Y3I2bnNxVGJBT3ZDSndfdUp4RDhCcktWdXlqS3BxUzJldXBjVGItS2pNM3l1Q2tVR3luVDJ4X1BQUkN1T0JMZ3R1OFVfaWFkYkF2RjNXV1ZLZ0E9PQ==

been in data science and analytics for about <number> years now took a new job last fall as my prior employer had no opportunity for advancement and i felt like i had hit a dead end the new job has been a big disappointment im overwhelmingly busy and i feel overqualified but its recently gone to a point where i know i cant stay longterm this breaking point was that i got a rush assignment and provided baseline numbers then sat in a meeting where the business folk plugged numbers into a spreadsheet until they liked what they saw and called it a model i realized that <number> my job is pointless if they arent going to use the numbers i provide and if they want to fudge a model which takes away a feeling of job security and <number> i cant deal with this from a moralethical standpoint my employer is a household name that most people wouldve heard of these models they make are highly revered and have been published in reputable mediums such as new york times amongst others if i could get some advice on <number> how to deal with this while i wait out the job market and <number> when do we think the job market might recover a bit right now my job listing searches come back without anything worth considering and only a handful at that also i know i need to be in job for a while to have something on my resume so theres that too,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUMzFwV0RFUGRZTS14M2tHRlVTb051NDVNZlI0STVadms0YVdVTGhZYlpoV0JIX25NTHdhNUZUWmhDOWZ5X3p1ejVDLTRTZHZJX0YyenZfODFsNXlMaGc9PQ==

here a couple of tips for you to improve put a lot of emphasis on your comms like double or triple down on it read others work internal and external ds related and nonds related this will help you to understand how great story telling look like when your team members or anyone presents try to understand what worked well and what didnt for yourself and by reading the audience read books storytelling with data for example incorporate what youve learnt like that and make conscious decisions about what worked and what didnt and iterate get feedback and try to get mentored by people that are great communicators i e i worked closely together with an internal consultant to improve my and my teams presentation skills including plotting always try to get better im managing people for a while now and this is a skill that i more often than not have to double down in with new hires so you asked a highly relevant question lastly a couple of general tips for storytelling ask yourself who your audience is and whats most relevant for them how will they use it whats the business value of your work write a story with a clear call to actions and name the teams that in your opinion can or should own the action keeo it easy to understand and efficient no one wants to desipher your message or go through technical details before getting to the meat of your message keep it as simple as your audience needs it plot for purpose and remove unnecessary clutter plots should be self expainatory even when embedded in text make em simple and use the title for the point you want to make the subtitle can be used to add any necessary description are you presenting is this a write up what you show should be also aligned with the type of comms manage the audiences cognitive load wherever you can the focus should always be on your main points be opinionated you are the expert you are expected to have an opinion based on the work you did adjust your write up multiple times until you are really convinced that someone with way less context than you understands your intention always keep it friendly but dont shy away from pointing out results that are concerning those are most often the most interesting ones and have the potential to initiate change thats actually the reason why you get paid to change things for the better those are just a few points and sorry that the above isnt very structured i hope helps tho,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcTRYZjZNNlRqMC15SDg3WHJQazg4TGoxX1NrNUswamZrNlJMbmRja2FkMVdfel9xM0JGeGdQSUhpVkFSZVRXX0xkb2pJckRCaHNfVWNsZnR3ay1BRWc9PQ==

im also trying to improve my communication and i thought i could share the most helpful feedback ive received so far for me its fundamentally about focus how can i deliver the most important message and block out the rest heres how i like to practice the skill first id try to get specific about the kind of communication that youre trying to improve analysis docs speaking decks etc because each requires a different skillset id focus on one form to begin with every time that you communicate even a slack message to your team is a chance to practice as ive worked on more docs or decks ive gotten a better sense of what good communication looks like i have a swipe file of examples of excellent communication and ive compiled a list of the patterns that they follow a communication checklist that helps me diagnose if my communication is unclear many of the best examples follow barbara mintos pyramid principle<url> or answer first communication simultaneously i would also try to identify your own communications patterns and figure out which youd like to change for instance i observed that i tend to get nervous before i speak and consequently speak too fast slowing down my breath beforehand helps me improve dramatically you could even recruit someone you trust to give you feedback if its difficult to identify these patterns yourself ive found that communication is a skill where ill always be learning especially as i need to adapt to new audiences with their own preferences for how they like to receive information hope this helps,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUelFaVHItenlNWDQzVXRzeDdzeUljZG9BVVdsbDFPUWZncER6QlJaWTdlckVoc1A4NFRxRXZpQjN5N2V4aEZ3UnlweFNJdlNXZkRzSmVPT3V4SGdXOThFZWVDalFUcGJXbjRJTmZjTWJfZXM9

completely subjective i enjoyed my s but because of it i had to grind hard in my s when i had a wife and kid and mortgage and it was not as relaxing as it could have been with that said i loved the second half of my s and wouldnt change it for the world optimally you should find a balance that you dont hate and honestly thats the threshold that really matters if you try to make everything perfect youll inevitably not be satisfied but if your goal is to not hate your life that is pretty easy to achieve for some context i dropped everything and solo traveled for <number> years at age <number> i dont regret it at all and i will never be able to live that freely again in my life so im glad i did it when i could but it also cost me years of time with my loved ones i have the yoe of someone <number> younger than me and i basically had to relearn everything when it was time to get back into the job market there are things like that that will become harder as you get older and thats probably worth investing in photographystandupbeach life is going to be exactly the same level of investment in <number> years as it is now probably better in many aspects,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUU1ZmaTRnYUk4TU04NDhKUWd2b3IwVlZsYUVHcGZtd3lTNlhsTHVXS2tqX1JneXFEMjFnZ2pTMWJWejk3YUNaWnFZRHo5d2lES09YR0VHZjJlLXFzVWc9PQ==

i think the top voted comment is one of the best ways to deal with this but if you are genuinely worried about the impact on the companies deliverables call a meeting with the managers of the silos managers of the analysts that are copying inform them of the situation highlight the potential issues to the companies performance and then suggest a solution eg establish the notebook logging and ensure alerts can be sent for components that are highly specific to the original use case you can definitely leverage this situation to improve your value and position at the company both intrinsically and in the eyes of the managers dont just let this continue in the messy way that it is take ownership of the situation hopefully with the newfound confidence that a significant of the work being done is using your code and workflows,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcExzZnNDR1lNa0RLMk1jWG8ycWtaUWNJOWtRZjVqSVA5SWN5WXBUaUJTNlBzZktTbmVQU21xNEM1VmRqb25mTG1xS3c5dktCMXZ2empUcWR0U3lvWkE9PQ==

propaganda with a healthy dose of nonsense one of the most universal patterns to emerge from anthropological studies of hunter gatherer societies spread all over every continent societies which have sustained themselves for tens of thousands of years is that the amount of labor incumbent upon the individual to survive is vastly less than that imposed by agriculture and later by capitalism i point to our least technologicallysophisticated societies to emphasize that the notion that the cruel realities imposed by capitalism are somehow natural or intrinsic to our existence is absolutely absurd our struggle is not against nature its against men that use the labor of other men to create a cycle of compulsive authorority thats what we are racing against in order to stand still,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSEhGVkduOVhmVFU0QVBYeTBEaVQ2OHMwNldubDMwUGhWOEh4SVBBbGcxUmFsSEdkNndfbjlYVGVyU1RvbDQ1N3dteE13blBCSk1udHdXYVdRd2g1dUE9PQ==

yes but those requirements come from the nature of capitalism ie perpetual growth my point is that this philosophy is not natural it is an artifact of capitalism and it has been exacerbated over time even within recent memory eg the heyday of americas postww boom which was probably capitalism at its most benevolent it was perfectly reasonable to expect that the skills one had acquired upon maturation would be sufficient to support oneself throughout adulthood support a whole family even on a single persons efforts unthinkable today,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdmFpZzhyUXRKVGZzbF9OU1JlbW15aGFhZkNLcFVOdnlXUC1QZEN2N1NKX0lEUkZjcmVwRF9GTXQtOFN1S3F6TVVXaThPcTQySzQ3T3dkUGlZd3Y4OFE9PQ==
as everyone else has said its very subjective and your priorities and perspective will change with experience the way i see it is an overlap of a bunch of different categories that people prioritize in different ways mental healthstresswork life balance short term salary career growth opportunities industry interest project specific work interest luck for me early on in my career i was more focused on career growth and salary then realized after my first job i needed an industry that was cool because riskaverse financial banks were boring as hell in addition to that was a whirlwind of shit with my mental health and learning how to deal with my bipolar disorder which led me to a higher prioritization of mental health and work life balance so that kind of guided where i looked for a new job my second job was very unlucky and a strike out really cool industry and really cool projects but severely adversely affected my mental health so i had to cut that one so i re prioritized my search and tried to look for places that more aligned with what i needed and then that leads me to luck an overlap of all categories that provide just enough of each to make you content i wouldnt know what contentness was at this point in my career unless i experienced what i had in the past to give me that perspective as well as taking a leap to explore other options and not remain stagnant with no change that will lead you to insanity its like the fallacy in reinforcement learning of exploration vs exploitation sometimes you gotta explore the world to experience more reward than what you think is out there you may just so happen to stumble upon a company that the stars align and you probably wont leave unless youre fired this wont happen with everyone but make sure youre vocal at wherever you are to express what you think will make you content as with most things in life it is a balancing act some people get hard ons for showcasing their projects and bragging about their work on linkedin and how they work <number> hours a week if thats what they enjoy then good for them they have their priorities in line and can focus on workcareer growthsalary some people get hard ons for their hobbies and extracurricular traveling seeing friends and therefore their work life balance will be a higher priority and for them i think thats great if thats what they love for me i get a hard on for not being depressed and wanting to kill myself every night before going to sleep and thats why i prioritize mental health over everything else but again i wouldnt know that unless i experienced what i had in the past so to you my good sir try not to compare yourself to others so much do an introspection into what you prioritize the most take some leaps of faith dont listen to the world around you and find your peace only you know what will make you content anonymous dildo,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdEJPQlpHeV9ySEdWckRPU1E3eXhJT1Z4YjBEbXcxOEt2b2hwWFRFMGlfV0FaaHJ6U3JuVW1zMm9xWUV4VVNCVFdpYXBReHNXV3VZOHZIVEdmbTFYa1E9PQ==

i agree with you on the infinite growth point as its obviously not sustainable in a finite world on the other hand the limitations apply only within a single business or domain and not globally as some domains die out but others emerge with regard to a specific domain i think its due to the sigmoidal nature of its growth once a new domain is discovered it grows easily and exponentially at first and then platoes bringing diminishing returns on investment of effort eg <number> years ago one could make a living from knowing how to reinstall windows and change cartridges in printers now one needs a cs degree from a top uni + yoe + certifications and may still struggle to find employment so it seems that starting out in csit now isnt as beneficial as it used to be and young people should perhaps consider other domains,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUQjUtX3pkaXZUSVh0TjhuWmdiT0l0VjR0TkEtTlpZVmhmaU15YXViZEplTzdONkR0VXFlRGVWVlBLaDR5OExtbDdpWFg0QjdSWHpuMlU5d0hrb25CM3BkcFpuRkwzelZKb1lVZldMdGRTZG89

if youre considering going back to school i would focus on and would finish that as soon as possible going back to school is one of those things that becomes much harder once you get older this is because people tend to have a lot more demands on their time like from significant other kids chores gym etc and you need to add some leisurely time in there so you dont get burned out so while you can do it when youre older and people do in reality many people try to do it and fail other than that though everything else can either be balanced or delayed,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUbWxSeHF2eU52WUZLb0tjS2NqNjRNcVJyRmZwWEFnc2pVd01SamNNX1QtMEtiQlZ1Z3N0dlFaNDczai1OdVI2U1J2YzIzTEtiMEU2M1RRbWZCVExTLXc9PQ==

as a general rule of thumb any certification for a product language service thats from the company that makes that product language service holds some weight anything else is of questionable value databricks has a vested interest in providing a fairly rigorous certification process they make some cash from it and it makes it easier for their customers to hire people who are competent with the platform ms is the same for azure but edx and similar platforms just have a vested interest in selling you courses of course an edx course could be far harder more rigorous and more indepth than its databricks equivalent but as an employer i have no way of knowing that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWEh1TkY0dWt2UWZUQ2VSekhpd2JPejFUTkJOd3BqXzk5bUlBRXpiTE9GazNYMmFCOUhaMUM4bnBRWUt0M1ExNHMzSERyUG9kMnp4cXctcFpEdUhRdGc9PQ==

if youre really desperate for a job then go ahead and do it but down the line if you have a job already its a hard pass on any type of takehome projects theyre a horrid method for evaluating candidates yes even worse than shit like live coding especially since you generally cant even use them as a portfolio project so basically just a time sink that doesnt translate between other interviews whereas prepping for statscoding interviews helps for multiple companies at the same time and is also not at all reflective of how shit actually gets done in a workplace if a company has a takehome project as part of their interview process i tell them to go kick rocks because its not going to be a good fit,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZGZfTGE4Rmh5ZHVpeVFSTnQ4UTVkbE5YWnhHXzc5aHhVbXN1Tmpkay1MU29YWFF6TTZ1aWxGdzZRNURvMk84ZXFSMUxXdDRYOWcwYnNtak5iR0N4eVE9PQ==

as a hiring manager i refuse to include any type of homework in the loop its unfair to candidates and i dont trust candidates not to cheat so its not bringing anything meaningful to me as a candidate i have been asked this and last time it was a surprise so i withdrew i have a good job and wasnt all that excited about the role and springing a complex financial statement analysis on me which isnt what i do anyway was too much without knowing your situation id say you have to balance the investment in this homework given it may not lead to a job versus the knowledge that refusing will certainly not lead to a job so if youre really hard up you dont have much choice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVTGNwQnFmb25wV2F4akNOZENhMFdWYmtlcTZWazdCN1NwZG14UExwNHdwTzBuOWRYbmQ4VFg3ZlFUSG1iZnlnR1hveVF4Ym1pSHNxNlJzcDVhTUVxVEE9PQ==
im going to mention something thats not been mentioned below coefficients in nonlinear models are conditioned on the other coefficients and values for the additional variables effects are nonlinear so focusing on coefficients is a bad idea some people look at odds ratio but if you look at who does that the most medical clinical trials which are experiments so they are basically blocking other variables or making other variables part of their design like demographics with what you want to do you cant do this so i would encourage you to look at probabilities you can check out gelman and hills book on hierarchical modeling because their chapter <number> or around that is on logistic regression and mc simulations the causal aspects is iffy because models show correlation but i dont think your manager is talking causal in the proper statistics way more in the i want an explanation for this which is acceptable for models and what the other commenter said thinking about confounders controls data structure what is affected what and how and why etc not throwing the kitchen sink at your model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcFZXeGo3Um5lWUtFQzVjTUt6d2VDQjQ4anpZU1k5T05CSkVQSTNoSmI5M3hXbHFoUkFpOWc2VktuY3pKNXp1SkFFZ3QtdjFtT3lfbFMtNWhiV2RuWlE5cGNJT0JMTjBrWTB0ZERhaFpUUEE9

youre on both the right and wrong track starting with simple models first is a good idea linear regression and logistic regression are fairly easy to interpret and generally where i start that said i think youre a few steps before even that do the exploration and a couple of ttests on relevant metrics to see if you find any statistical significance report back anything interesting to your manager reading between the lines thats probably what he is looking for and you can dig deeper if that information proves interesting to him and the people he reports to,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVQUxsdDR5UTRqM2I1T1A1NjhQajF0dFVMUDNvTUpTWl9hTVRzRDhxZlBBcDlTNWswM3RGaHhUSVZYcG9BVWxud2hodVV2dGRyTjlTby0tUVpNZEFncmc9PQ==

ive recently changed roles and company going from a managerial position into ic since joining its become apparent that progression will be harder than i expected and i am in fact being moved under other less senior staff than i expected to report into i had hoped to gain deeper technical skills in the role from learning from colleagues but more often than not i am actually training them on software its mle but most data work is dashboards and slides ive only been here a few months but its getting me down because i left behind a company i had progressed well at and am constantly second guessing if i am losing momentum in my career and potentially letting hard gained skills rust my question is really how do you know when to cut your losses on a move like this and when to ride it out if moving is best any tips for framing the experience and reasons for leaving i know flavours of this question get asked regular but would be grateful for any thoughts thanks,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRFZPeFhvSDlCQmpVSXZpY19SQUZwWDJxby1wdG1uQzNFR3hzQ3hsZUE1VXRPSVo2MTBIcEJDUlR5ZjNkQ2xfWkYtRlliekNSMS14WnlhcDliMGNZN3c9PQ==

oh i didnt see all these people correct you already the general thrust of what is being repeated here is the same humans worldwide employed a variety of labor protoeconomic systems prior to the emergence of agriculture and subsequent specialization ie dedicated nonworkers which enabled subsequent barter and currency but even following the emergence of barter currency it was millennia before capitalism emerged post enlightenment and heck even now there are entire cultures eg particularly muslims that view any form of usury lending as inherently immoral which puts some twists on what we mean by capitalism saudi wealth funds notwithstanding anyway again the idea that capitalism is the only system humans have used is just factually wrong and the idea that the perpetual foreverstruggle for survival i modern capitalism is the only way or how things have only been is likewise silly,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWnVQQXJ2cXZicUV1ZUd6LXNqWDJHTmF2a1BmTmFPWUtCa3QzYmZuaXhLYS1udlNmZ01mOXk1NDdGZ1RpRlBvcVhVMUFzWDBqTFA5UDAwSUJNYTg0UVE9PQ==

i think you made interesting points here particularly with respect to the expansion and decay of role values this wouldnt be a problem if we were playing something like simcity or civilization or stellaris pops would just hop from domainrole to role in perpetuity as the relative value fluctuated over time but in real life we only live so long and this reductionism is terribly cruel for example a diligent kid might mortgage their future with loans in order to get the education to be the it guy only to find surprise were no longer valuing that gig by the time they enter the workforce and sure folks can switch roles but this comes with costs and no one can predict the next big thing if they could why bother with a job at all when they could just say trade to riches so yeah i think your point just emphasizes another inherent terrible flaw in capitalism,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVYWIyQjF2dWpxUVpxdHpOa1pIWUdmM2NCZ1BaT1dSNTBuaUl5aXd0VEJlUmJKdHJzdE5DVm1JMVl5YUFTRkRHcHdqRmZUOXJoQkFRSF9pVU1KaGowTGc9PQ==

if you have a time limit its usually the one who spent the most time on it most jobs require learning and when you have one assignment and never let the candidate defend their work you wont discover which candidate can adapt and pivot their skillset the most in fact you dont even know if the candidate actually did the assignment themselves so many employers have wasted so much of my time with bs assignments its also nearly impossible to convince oneself to do something like an assignment over and over again ive interviewed for a couple of the top tech places and no assignments by them lots of interviews but their not wasting free time and dont seem to have a problem with ds not having the right skills without an assignment if people just made their roles <number> month contract to hires they wouldnt have to worry about all this garbage and theyd actually be able to vet their candidates and hire people quickly versus quiting for months while people pass an assessment and then fail a face to face and repeateven though there was probably a candidate who had a lesser score bc they put less time into and are actually a better candidate,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVa1M0dllTS2FkSlhaOXBNRkdVTENZUk5LVXhMUjQ3RXdLVEtOSGVhT3ZPVVZRVXFCREtyQ0RvNGFKemIzaW44V0Mwd3ZodDVfOFpEaWJBNjloUm1SbFdfWGowdGRFNFhad18zTTdOaG1wMkE9

same i assumed the rationale was always that the more junior the role the more likely a takehome project is partly because seniors just have more experience you can dig into during interviews and you can likely take most of the more basic skills for granted not so for inexperienced people also supply > demand for junior roles you can generally ask for what you like when interviewing juniors ask senior candidates for a hefty takehome assignment and watch as every candidate worth hiring says thanks but no thanks,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWDhheU04VUN0bVkyTmI1SS0zSWZEV0pCLWUtVzE1RlRkdmo5bDNtNEJMd0Qzam4xVFg0NFZaMTZCRFNJVmY1LVVHZzB1NWlucWVYUUJTTC0yVVpCcGc9PQ==

well the one i found seemed to lay out the problem with ohe very well dimensionality explosion with very spare data and proposed an embedded layer as a solution so ideally id like that one but i realize that might be like finding a grain of salt in a pile of sand so any papers that specifically discuss the pros and cons of these two methods would suffice ive found several that discuss embedding techniques but i liked the idea of an embedding layer because if im not mistaken the authors created the layer size with lendfcolnunique if im remembering that right and it works i think it would be a great way to create a model that is flexible enough to help with the training of a large population model but specific enough for deploying to a single user because the size of the layer is created dynamically each time based on the number of distinct values in an identifier column im trying to convince my peers that one hot encoding is not the best way to transform it identifier variable because the dataset will become so sparse that the variable will essentially become meaningless within the calculations and want to back up my stance,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVQkN4MDlicVkycnJITlVpa3diM3FEU3pxS2NuVjJtRkZmeTNDYXhFR1JCOElrdU5qNlNfam14dUxVeUkxcFVNekpXQlZmLTNkSFlvc2p2VHRLM2VockE9PQ==

i feel like leaders in an organization implicitly decide how important data will be to the organizations decisionmaking frequently data is competing with user feedback or experts for primacy in the companys notion of truth for instance companies like duolingo lead with data this not only means that there is a culture of routinely testing all the new features that they release but also that theyve invested in the tools to make this easy to do and reliable imo this comes from luis von ahn who is a highly technical cofounder and values that approach to decisionmaking this is certainly different at other companies like apple for instance who emphasize user research more in their learning process ive only seen these tendencies change when the leaders change,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcXhWblZsXzdDWjY3clFEaWdQQi1vanN2X0hzS1V4dUJNSDVBdUlCb3RndDBTX3dIeG9PX29MdGNvMUh4QUJfTXY4UmFQRXcyYXVLOHpvNzNLdzlyLVZmWXpqaFZVdTV0NzQ5T3gwV3hvRFE9

i think that using a lot of data is often mistaken for being datadriven if you run a lot of reports build a lot of models but decisionmakers ultimately pick and choose what numbers they choose and believe and make whatever decision they want without it being retroactively scrutinized relative to a datadrive approach then youre not data driven the data doesnt do any driving the data is in the trunk and its brought out when you need it to justify your point heres what i have seen smart companies dont fool themselves they look at the things that can and should be data driven and make them data driven and then they take the things they dont think can be data driven and just focused on having a welldefined disciplined process that can be evaluated and improved on so for example i worked at a company that had incredibly stable predictable sales and very infrequent and clearcut price changes that company was insanely data driven as it related to price changes because they knew the data told them <number> of the story there was no room for people to come with opinions to a pricing meeting on the other hand this company often introduced new products in new areas and they knew that data would never answer <number> of the questions they had about products with no history what they did do is set up a very structured process for how to approach those situations in a way that was repeatable and decomposable so that once you got to see what actually happened you could go back and ask well what went well and what went wrong so for example in defining the plan for a new product you would make some choices <number> what past new product is this most likely to behave like and why do we believe that <number> what is the rate at which we will introduce the product to the market from a supply chain perspective <number> what are our anticipated marketing fundspromotionsetc going to look like over the onboarding period <number> how have focus group results compared to past similar products so the strength of that process is that once things actually happened if you missed big it wasnt just a oopsie poopsie we messed up it was well it looks like we overestimated how quickly we could roll this out and we overeestimated the effectiveness of ad campaign a which then allows you to go back and evaluate why you overunderestimated specific factors,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVeEtMQUJ0QTZFMk5yR29NSUxUVjVDSi1hbkotRU1lZ3piT3dHUmQ5dGtBb1I2OVc3YjA5REEyek80bzY2TncwVHJiQ3FVOVZlT244XzdTV2xsdzlUVFE9PQ==
my approach to stuff like this is that i will give my opinion and if someone else wants to proceed with bs anyway then its not my company not my call and not my problem i dont work in an environment where lives are at stake or anything like that however if i am pressured to provide my approval for bs especially in writing i will refuse to take any kind of principled stand you have to be willing to lose the job i obviously dont know your situation but if losing your job would be a catastrophe for you that is a disaster waiting to happen what if you are laid off,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcGJuSk1HaWdRMDFUQ1h4NEZkYVdLeHNhbGxwR2loY3VTZ1NLUFFyMEt2ci12VVlsclM1bWNaRE1LbGViRkRvTjh0OUNYVEE3RmtEa05DU1pISWwteEE9PQ==

i assume its because data science has such a high barrier for entry most of the folks talking about tech careers who have a large following do it by appealing to people trying to enter the field or by convincing people they should enter this field thats a hard sell for data science its an easier sell for data analyst roles though which is why most of the influencers with larger followings focus more on those roles than ds another possibility is software dev is a much more popular job and also have been around for longer ds is still somewhat new and a lot of people outside of the field have no idea what it is,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVMzhNRERFeWhDMHZRWERBOTg4VmNva1FlNnFzLVlGQ3F1bjhWSHIwbWhTR001WmxrZXFaOHRDLUdBT1FxMmhSRHFiOF81QlRRZHE1THdCbUpNVk9aNGc5bFdSaklDWDdEZV9Ec2NlZ0RYVjg9

well i guess the key difference is whether youre querying from a sql db or using a pandas dataframe sql can handle billions of rows of data easily while pandas is very slow as it scales however for more sophisticated modelling you would need to use pandas so depends on which phase of the problem you are currently often this is how the workflow is you look at raw data in sql build some hypotheses around your problem and when needing to build some advance analytics pipeline do you use some predictive modelling pandas is often use to load data as an intermediary when building a model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVVWVMWUZqWXg5RnN0N1VkdUNtY25aMGtGMXg1ejJ4bWY2RVJTdmtTeHo2cS01RXVLSHJXbXVQdnJKQ2Zrc09pUGNLVkZjVkhLV00tTnZIaDkxd05hVWc9PQ==

people are being paid for the information you want them to share it with you so you can learn and get smarter quickly second this creates a dependency chain youll treat them well till they are sharing youll use them as your easy button and if they stop sharing because of the constant bother youll start treating them as enemy happened to me and hence am very strict with boundaries around sharing vs handholding im not getting paid to teach others how to do their job,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVX3FCVDFzWnRBYlBKb0NaUG9VZXRpaGJyY1phZ1JRX3BnNUFmNFNzTXpCQkNuOVVvdnhYalNIT09WUnJISTZieVRiTU9CMU1qdG92OVEyZVlQZXk0enc9PQ==

wrong the distinction youre noticing but misattributing is that people often talk about a data set which is a singular thing without actually saying the set part a data set is when it is clear from context that the data in question is being discussed as a set using plural verbs reasonably sounds a bit off on the other hand data referring to the individual data points in that set is plural the data points are the thing youre missing again is that people often omit the word points and just expect us to get from context that they are talking about data points plural the word data in this usage is a countable plural and yes data are countable in the englishgrammar meaning because you can write them in a list or to use the singular meaning of data a set of data is countable because you can write it as a list my favorite data set singular is the one where there are five data points plural,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVNTAySFNwSWtZNjNkY21tWVNaZnQ4MF9EM1hXc2Zha3Q2M0Vxal8yUWhpYmlndXhFNHRvcGlJUVh5bkwtQloxTHg2dmc0TDgxQnFySHFIVFJza3JrVG5WaERwV0huT21ycmVTcEtiemczSnM9
what ive seen in my industry of our small dslike vendors is provide some off the shelf solution usually a dashboard in a locked down portal that requires the client connect and provide unfettered access to their data stores to fill in for like <cur>k<cur>k provide hourly billable support to offer interpretations of said solution on a regular clip with like <number><number> free hours monthly <cur><number><number>hour provide billable hours to modify off the shelf solutions with regular maintenance and patching free <cur><number><number>hour wrap each of these solutions plus the hours as individual packages so clients cant just pool the free hours to have customization and interpretation done for one of the products they value the most they keep all the data they can access and use it to train models and provide industry insights to other clients that those clients theoretically wouldnt be able to have without them they rely heavily on outsourcing the actual technical work to lcol regions usually this means clients have very long lead time for customizations and such meaning they are more likely to keep paying for those extra billable hours each quarter for interpretation and simple customizations to present to executives and board kinda like mmorpg game devs making you grind xp while paying a subscription thing modeling is very rare and expensive nothing they provide is sophisticated ecosystem meaning they have a bunch of stuff thats locked into their portal and only works for their data stores and such that way you have a harder time as a client finding competitors and converting to them for the same results proprietary data proxy type stuff like tech propensity score and whatever else usually some shady opaque scoring mechanism that has no real rigor behind it that provides clients with what amounts to very made up information about their customers consider your clients dont have internal expertise so they wont even notice the distributions and such are synthetic ive found this at my employer and have to have some very sensitive conversations with the executives and other leaders whos performance and successes are pointing at these things data engineering is basically sftp and uptake to a database to feed your report portal,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRWZHWkk0cGZVWFp3VDUya0diVDR3b1M1cWltb2RCR2JNai1ORmJJS1dCZ3pFM1NwaHNhd3JmX3JYWS1Hd2RMYWxDSjFzQjdpM2ZuU19VQXNZWGFFWkE9PQ==

its about how you react to difficult situations you see this more in senior nontechnical roles if a particular tech role expects you to coordinate with a large number of people or external clients they want to see how you react to uncomfortable situations which come up more often than youd expect ive seen this a lot using tactics like questions with no right answer awkward silences straightfacedconfused reactions short replies to your answers it helps you filter out the ppl that would panic or start rambling nonsense or lose confidence when out in uncomfortable situations the ones that have good critical thinking and a strong ability to verbally articulate themselves stand out you need to react with confidence and articulate your thoughts well if the question confused you ask clarity in a way that leads to additional information like oh is this concept x similar to concept ymaybe explain how you made that connection if you get an aswer completely wrong try and get the expected answer out and build on that conversation you want to interview to be a flowing conversation by the middle of it not an interrogation in my opinion,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVamlIaldRRFpzdGVyemZRMG5wRUxxeFlBY05YTkh1V0tWbG1oQk1Pc0MtTFg1aEE3TWE0YURjY1BSa0VOamRjNkxWRlZNb3dYUWUtMFZOUkk2dVVyUkE9PQ==

i think you hit many of the top data science influencers im aware of if you broaden data science to analytics eg im an applied statistician but i might mainly work in sql prefer spreadsheets and bi tools there is a much larger group for what its worth ive been thinking about this and am happy to share my thoughts im certainly no authority on the topic though <number> firstly our space is already very small and niche there are huge skin care influencers but theres also a ton of people with skin <number> proportionally fewer data scientists want to become an influencer i think theres a large barrier to entry since the opportunity costs for data scientists to move to influencing fulltime is so high why quit your comfy wellpaid fancy ofteninteresting research andor corp job to make pennies on the dollar sharing content on social platforms and so theres just a smaller pool of people who want to create and share content <number> data science influencers grow slowly and its early days also i think these folks audiences and reputation will grow much more slowly then in lessniche very broad topics i could be very wrong but i see the data science influencer crowd as being biased towards folks who are very good communicators more charismatic and they value sharing with others what theyve learned while many folks who are more technically minded by that i mean people developing new methodologies contributing to packages tooling writing the most popular books and textbased resources im aware of are no offense less skilled oncamera and often couldnt care less about social media beyond blogging or giving conf talks and so those technical folks who we might prefer make more content tend to make cool stuff write blogs books and talk at conferences their content is very technical harder for broad audiences to appreciate content thats unlikely to go viral i think that means these the aspiring data science influencer crowd mainly grow audiences first with novicelearners and people considering applied stats as a major or career therefore these folks wont have much of a reputation until their audiences become more senior joshstatquest the biggest i can think i think has only been fulltime for <number><number> years now i personally think josh is amazing a really lovely person makes great videos and has a fanbase that agrees but hes only growing at k a new subs a month<url> so thats an its very early days argument for why we dont see many big folks that is while a travel influencer might be able to grow quickly in the ds space folks with no reputation will probably take a long time and a lot more work to grow a sizable audience <number> the most popular data science content is domainspecific domain experts talk about our work better than we do and then i feel noone has really cracked the format to make data science inandofitself more broadly interesting i feel the most viral data sciencey content tend to be interesting plots see rdataisbeautiful chartrdaily and great data journalism the content that really blows up is often attached to a specific domain for instance <number> has amazing data scientists sharing their work but nate silver isnt know as a data scientist hes well know an elections modeler and sports analytics expert just my recent thoughts maybe i should have made this into a video for the tiktok,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVN25DM1liQmpjQl9zenRnVUM3OEEzaUN0MkpyRFkza2VDZHNTUjJ1M1QzVF9pS0o0NEczOVZETzJjMjVLdWF1UXBQQlJQY0tFR1laXzRVd2JVcnVudVE9PQ==

hey all nice to meet you been lurking here for a minute and figured this is the best place to ask this question this is all over the place so apologies in advance im a chemist and worked in process engineering for manufacturing organizations for <number> years now learning and utilizing stats programs like jmp and minitab was a huge key to my success in experimental design data driven decision making and technical communications both up and down the corporate ladder im typically doing regressions anova ttests with tukey kramer analysis some optimization modeling control charts outlier tests stddev etc and all the other baseline tools needed for a nonstats person to pretend like i know what im doing lol stats work + data processing have been the most enjoyable part of my journey thus far and also feel it would open up many career opportunities in the future my goals are expansion of abilities for director level roles that require technical background chem and process devt with expanded abilities in data processing and statistics potentially clinical trials and the like alternatively a full blown career change to ds or stats for manufacturing organizations may be equally fulfilling my problem is im not really certain what im getting myself into what is doing graduate level statistics like in school and what is it like in industry would anyone care to share their perspectives on the above to help me make a more informed decision thank you in advance,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVbG1OTkZva3JpMUwtYUI0Q3BscXI5TDBzZm9UVkF5dGk0bXpQVEo3MjE3dTIzeUlVTk9fdXBSaDk2VS01cUgxSTd0c2tjbVVXVTRWYU1ERmhjNTh2SlZLXzYydlhLck5kbS13ZXhOTlBWUzQ9
i used to overshare but i stopped as my team is managed with secrecy now information and knowledge is the power in the enterprise world it saddened me as you grow when you share as it gives you more ideas and help you to strengthen your own thoughts but when you are getting old for the field it is something the only way to keep a job most of the time i used to be dumped a messy project with crazy historical issues without no explanation and then the expectations were that i was in charge of writing all the docs and factor all the codes so anyone could useunderstand by anyone i mean not the most brilliant people in the team and then they were complaining about my documentation i stop to share it saddens me but it is my only way to survive with stupid people,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVOVM1NnN6ZGZTeUtZWk91aHBRdWNxUGJybVFSRkJQSE9JbUx0VlhMU1Myb3paRTVpVkpXRHQxNGhmRFlWdzRLVEU3N3lJbjhOVVZmNWw3VG1CZ2V4NndSTmJENXJkdzhBUVpnS3RLbEVhMDg9
the other motivator that they wont admit to if i only trickle feed you the information youll need to keep coming to me so i look indispensable if i give you too much of my knowledge you might be able to bypass me and i might be seen as dispensable not every time and i cant be entirely sure but i imagine its a more common reason than forgetfulness or a dedication to secrecy maybe im just too cynical,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVV0xHVmoyR1kyZERldlIwMmxWVnFrSHZfWmdqY0VWQUU4MG0yRGJLQzFDNmpiSVl1OE1vb2EzVnk4eVNlZEdickJVRWlKZTI5WHdGekp1dUtHV0dUVUE9PQ==

depends on the specifics of the question and your seniority if it was a true gotchatrick question the interviewer sucks they want a smug sense of superiority from knowing something in advance and watching you mess up if its a question with many answers and not a clear approach this is alright provided its level specific so if the interviewer asks a candidate to diagnose a hypothetical revenue decline whatever answer the candidate gives should be judged against the position they are interviewing for not an absolute standard id expect a good answer to vary for an analyst senior analyst manager and director,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZG5XMlVsSWE0NjVvbTZpeTJKWFVLYUJ2eHAzVmx0dXFDb20zUGx3T2Y4b2Ffd2Y0X3l1VnFtZGhpSmtma25tSFpBZ21KT0p2VkRJdnJsVktsel9mWUE9PQ==

i wont defend it and i always shared what i learned but one thing you may not realize is that person may have gone through pain and agony to figure these things out themselves often with no help or guidance and somehow navigated through to be smes and suddenly there you are taking a short cut never offered them demanding information they went through many obstacles to acquire themselves and they may feel resentment that it is so easy for you after they laid all the groundwork they may even be stuck in their careers from all that backend work which is often unappreciated or rewarded and there you are all young and shiny and energetic moving forward on your career in what they perceive as climbing on their backs do they have a right to withhold their hardsought information no its not theirs and never was but having worked over the years with many smes like this i believe you need to master the art of appreciation of small talk of valuing what others achieved of becoming one with them and giving credit where credit is due once they recognize themselves in you they become much more open and accommodating and even friends and advocates try sprinkling some sugar with your requests,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRU5vakNoSlhaN3pmeVdvX29nazA4b0lBS2hJTXh1OG5zOUpiSGZEZ05mSk1BT2tSTGlhX1hTTTFxNk1OeTZ0TjVvTnN4d0JtZE15SGtjX2owZmRkZ3c9PQ==

information is not free good valuable information is rare if you were in openais insider circle you would get rich very quickly from the information they share they have all the data all the market trends all the user information all knowledge on the models and how to optimise them their information is very important and they spent billions to discover it it sounds like you want information so you think it should be free if you discovered very valuable information lets say you spend months in isolation working on a novel project you wouldnt want to give your methods out for free when you could patent it or productionize and sell it for millions giving you generational wealth or would you give it away for free academia is the only industry where methods and knowledge is shared for free and as a result salaries and pay is much less in this industry because everything is transparent but at the cost of greater respect and status this is a biased argument because you want something others have instead discover valuable information that others want from you not only will you understand the power of information but your career will exponentially yield you results and as a final remark there is an exception for academia where sharing novel information is seen as good,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWDNCTDE0NXQza1RJYkx6SmdwNVJZTlhhanRQYkpjXzBRN0wyaENYTHFoZEN0cGQ4aFY1QWpxUDU3Y1BpN3FOczhBSUhMdlJicEZUaXp0azdrOEtmRWc9PQ==

sometimes you just know within a few minutes an interview is going nowhere that the interviewer for whatever reason has no interest in you is dismissing you from consideration then and there and is filling time left by nonsensical questions or observations this is a test but one of endurance sometimes an interview is a chess game their move you move their move your move and there you have a real chance if you manage to avoid their announcing checkmate this too is a test but one of survival sometimes an interview is like a romp through multiverses where the interviewer keeps changing the subject almost in a stream of consciousness there your goal is to keep up with them wherever they go this is another test but one of flexibility you have to be prepared however the interviewer plans things out it has been like this since time immemorial i think,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVN201eTNaWWc0SWJ0N3d6OHVZY0JOdWRnRXZlQ2kyQWxwbGFvWXFQN09fVFpyeWlOX2dNb0NJaHVEMTRPV2NVNFl1UjFkd0hfbFJFQVdqd3RpT1V2SVE9PQ==

>regardless your claim that they are always latin is incorrect japanese loanwords likeninja<url>manga<url> andkana<url>end in a are plural and can be followed by the word are for example ninja are known to be sneaky or kana are the basis for collationin japanese oh thanks for pointing out that some japanese words end in a and fit the criteria as well awesome at the same time i dont feel you represented my whole criteria all that well further these japanese words and their grammar were borrowed and do not have much historical impact on what i think most english speakers would consider normative or obvious so have less weight in the discussion unlike latin rooted words also to be pedantic ninjas is a typical plural form of ninja uttcklbrrn was attacked by reddit ninjas is typical to indicate many individual ninjas not uttcklbrrn was attacked by reddit ninja and this whole conversation is about whats more immediately cleartypical for english speaker but i can understand why you would be confused in your example ninja refers to the category which ninjas belong to so it is a collective noun part of my second point in my original comment and collective nouns do not refer to many individuals but to a singular category ninja of which many individuals ninjas belong to i dont think many english speakers would read ninja are often sneaky and think youre referring to many particular ninjas you could point at the typical understanding would be that youre referring to the singular category we call ninja while you might be incidentally bringing it up in order to imply that ninjas are nearby this is my primary point the whole data are discussion hits on a nuanced confusion between plural nouns and collective nouns when one says the data suggests i think we really mean the collection of data i interpreted and summarized into singular personal interpretations or the category of all data recorded during that time interpretationsrecorded observations at some time are categorical summaries not many individual instances of that summarys category another example of this confusion in language is in categorical syllogisms saying all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore a more formal way of phrasing the middle statement is all people who are the famous ancient greek named socrates is a man now this may seem pedantic because there only ever was one such socrates but it shows how when forming categorical argumentsreferents eg like the data suggest we can hide that such a thing is a category because were relatively familiar with it in our senses im familiar with images and statues of what socrates may have looked like and these images are what i think of when i consider him so i may not think of him as belonging to a singular category even though he really is part of a category despite there being only one member similarly with data we may be too close to our senses and imagination imaging stark tables and records,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVR0NHRGVNNVBQTEdHcnB1ZTBjZ3VjYjhxVEFlSGlONXFoQXdBSS1FcTlaQUFJSl82NGEyVHl3VVVzOEpWcHlGN3lsTTFsNUtpNTZiajkwNDd0QU1ZMmc9PQ==
i think a big one is if those efforts will be appreciated as a contribution to the team and count towards performance or if only real work gets any credit if she can brag about it as a point on her annual performance review the team sees and appreciate the work she get better feedback from peers her boss and her direct reports etc it will benefit her career long term if no one cares like at some companies its just time spent not doing things you actually are measured against for performance so it can be harder to prioritize when you know no one else or at least not your boss thinks that stuff is important the incentives or rewards are often intangible but they can certainly have real impacts over the course of a career,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVdHlselByM0VSenQ1TmctZmpSNVE4UnF0Wm5CTS1FOThtc0FiN0xhamM3TnotRUR1RElBdFoydFVfdFJwcm9FZ0V3WU80OUhVM1pJUTh0VjJGOVNPalE9PQ==

hey hope everyones doing well im having some trouble making a decision and would appreciate any help from people to assist in making a choice i come from a noncs or nonquantitative background but from a stem field from a canadian university for my undergrad and i completed a dsfocused professional masters program at a wellknown canadian university as well i completed a year long internship during my program recently i was fortunate enough to be given a chance to enroll in a researchbased masters program for a degree related to machine learning at the same time i landed a job at a pretty good company with a good salary for a swe position this job i got through my connection which was very fortunate for me i want to pursue a career path in data science or data engineering in the long run im wondering which one i should choose should i pursue an additional graduate degree for a paper publication or should i accept the job offer ive heard from people around me that not getting a research masters will haunt me like a taboo and i cant make a decision between the two what would you do if you were me would appreciate any opinions or help thank you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVd0tUVkljZXNLYUpRRmh2UWE1SWZCeFluYURVNWx0amFSRGJHRll2aElnUk0yUXcwMlJhMnVYVEhuTl93VFFsU0lraUJ4SFU2WFZudkkxc2IwVlZKeGc9PQ==

no worries and full disclosure i am not a hiring manager or anything just a dude whos been a data scientist for <number> years because thats what you did in <number> after getting a pure math phd if you didnt want to go into academia haha ill have to look for another job soon myself my companys not doing well and im a little terrified of the process also i am in the us not canada gut feeling again an internship is much better than no experience especially a yearlong internship if you were able to produce a couple nice wins for your resume while you were there honestly i missed you describing your internship when you wrote your original comment my bad that said i still wouldnt quite put a yearlong internship on par with normal fulltime salaried work experience and even if others would and im just being a downer <number> yoe isnt that much swe experience would be extremely valuable if you want to be a data engineer and even if you want to be a data scientist swe skills are only becoming more and more valuable ive picked up a lot over the years like im fine containerizing stuff my code is clean i can make a little flask server for people to interact with my modelcode with im down with best cicd practices etc now but swes and people who have a deeper cs background still run circles around me with some of that stuff and god forbid you ever try to get me to work on anything frontend lol even if you publish a paper im not sure how much another masters will push you over the edge for jobs while there are definitely people out there with masters degrees that have cool research jobs the majority of research jobs are going to want a phd preferably with directly related ml research but if not then in one of the usual suspects like math stats cs econometrics on the other hand i think swe experience will move the needle for nonresearch jobs the vast majority of jobs much more than a paper get as many opinions as you can both choices could potentially lead to you kicking yourself down the line and like i said im just some dude haha not a career coach or hiring manager but my vote please make sure it is not the only vote is still take the swe gig,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWVHdYdmU3SVRDNUV2T0ZNZGZuX2dndlg4dUIyaTRobURheUJzcFJ4RWlfcUVUVjEtNlBsXzRTTGczTERKWkdScVI5UkVPWkRiUkVNXzVRZzFJYjFvSlE9PQ==

yes thats correct data is technically a plural noun with the singular form being datum however in common usage data is often treated as a singular noun especially in informal contexts good to be aware of this distinction especially in academic writing using data with a singular verb form like is or has is generally considered acceptable in modern usage but purists may still prefer to treat it as plural and use verbs like are or have me think consistency within a document or context is key,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWeDZkRXlvUG8zdmQtVnpvRjlSX3UwQktaZ09ud2p0a1NXTkNMb05HTTFQd2d3NTN2bFNLMXdfOFZnMW1CRUs5UjZtYnN6SE9pU1hGS2lPcEFXQTYxRWc9PQ==

geologists use multiple datums a lot well have a datum to describe sea level or things relative to the sea level datum and others relative to other datums such as epochs and eras if a crosssection is hung on a different datum ex this is the crosssection hung on the top oligocene datum its used to describe the singular level that a crosssection is relative to ie the zero line for a particular timesurface we also use data are and data is generally data are for publication and data is for speech edit uwrongsock,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWa1dzb3FLLUpJaVVlelM5eEpaT3Rib2Z3ekJYQTBDdXpuenlBVC1ZTmhfWUdkd3oyNl90XzhwMVdWTFFiaTc1UXlQN1dQbmU4WFRkYkthWE9oU1JSUHc9PQ==

i think this is a major issue in the industry as a whole there are a lot of companies that want to be datadriven but management does not understand data at all so even if you dumbitdown for them you still wont really get anywhere in the conversation on a similar note my background is in psychology and not ds the management youre describing sounds awful and a clearcut example of people who bully because they dont want to feel inferior for not understanding,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWcHJoSXpsNWJodEhVbl96eFdiNjBicFlqbnZURWdXaVU5VGZUaDc4TUpXRmhTaGpQR3cwVzdIejhQMXBYTUxaNlU3NW1zUWRZRTVHeGpsakpLMWdhN3c9PQ==
the funny thing is unlike those other examples eg millennium is biblical in origin data is actually a comparitively recent loanward so insisting on datumdata is more of an affected hypercorrection than adherence to legitimate english grammar its the pedantic classics student insisting the plural of octopus is octopodes while having one biscotto or two biscotti with their coffee theres evidence of th century pedants having precisely these same interminable arguments whilst common usage allowed data to function either as a plural or as a collective singular since its inception,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWcFJHbGk0WV9VWjJmSmNtUXRlOFJMdGJRRDhmMURINFBJdHEzeDcyZDlhT2dNVjRwcmV1SjlPQ2ctU2NkcVdTa1RvNWxHejUzTnBFdWF1R3JTempTN0pLTTNPeDM1NkZXVHlSY1pGZ2NzRkE9

the distinction is whether you are talking about a discrete collection or not so called noncount nouns or mass nouns like in your example water are treated as singular because of their inherently uncountable nature or are otherwise undifferentiated units of stuff you dont give many help you help a lot you have a lot of water not many water the issue with data is that in data science its not rare for you to know exactly how the data looks like how many pieces of information you have to data scientist the data which they write about is oftentimes a group of known individual facts which makes data a discrete group of units of information and therefore a counted group of things please keep in mind that this distinction is usually only made in academic papers or coworkers you dont want to grab a beer with after work and normal people will simply always use data as mass noun i understand the argument that the entire job of a data scientist is to work with discrete data and therefore data should always the used as a plural but i still dont like it your example is just half of the story and not exactly comparable,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWR0NpLW4xcEdOS2RDS0xfa2RteVVkamJ2M21HT1dzVDM1ajRXbkxQd2Y4ZmYwa0dXUHpGNjVYay1Id3luS2ROSjJ3VS1RNzhUNUVjUE5VS0t2RmpUcVE9PQ==

>phenomena but i guess thats greek ooooh yes another good one thank you theres also the occasional anglicanized phenomenons but thats not as typical anyway relating back to one of my points above can you help me think of any examples where phenomena is used in the plural noncollective form and immediately followed by the word are i cant think of one nor can i induce chatgpt to return any such examples the closest i can get are examples like >various atmospheric phenomena such as lightning and tornadoes are often studied by meteorologists to better understand weather patterns the jarring prosody between are and a plural word ending in a is softened by an aside that separates them it may also help when such an aside makes it clear that the noun is plural and noncollective since lighting and tornadoes are specific and individual phenomena being referred to that and having tornadoes next to are just feels like good ol murican english also after a bit of research it looks like this phenomenon hah poses some difficulty in the court room and is perhaps the reason why they say the individual members of the jury were seated as opposed to phrases like the singular category jury was seated <url><url>,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU1lfclFXTVNKNDh3cVQtNW9RT0dwVGxGWjRCTXBqSFBNVWhJbTYteWZWSnd3TUFKdlJzbi14SnhlclQwZGhfeFNzLW9vNnBybVEwb0gzZ21zeWE2cGc9PQ==

should i selfstudy data science or work towards actuarial exams im graduating from a big <number> school in a few weeks as a mathstatistics major i didnt have good enough grades to get into my schools ms stats program and was too late to apply to others so ive been working towards taking the soa actuarial exams instead however as ive been studying for these exams ive realized how much i enjoy learning applied math and statistics concepts on my own its making wish i could take graduatelevel courses in statistics and making me reconsider the actuarial route unfortunately most statsrelated jobs usually require a graduate degree that was why i was drawn to the actuarial exams since you just need to pass the exams to demonstrate proficiency in a topic and can do that on your own and i dont have the technical skills needed for a data analyst job since my degree was more theoretical but im wondering if the time ill be spending studying for the actuarial exams which is a lot about ~<number> hoursexam on the lower end and theres multiple exams in the upcoming months could instead be used to bridge the gap in my skillset for data analyst roles meaning i could easily become proficient in the skills needed for an entrylevel position in a fraction of the time needed for the actuarial exams and hopefully land a job then reapply to an ms stats program for next year besides i hear graduate degrees are becoming increasingly valuable for actuarial roles in recent years the only downside is that actuarial exams have a welldefined structure so you know exactly what you need to study and how to apply those topics and theres lots of resources on it plus its a very linear career path and each exam serves as a proof that you understand the relevant topics its difficult to prove this when selfstudying statsdata science outside of a github i suppose i dont see any online certificate programs that seem worth it except maybe the one google has please let me know if theres others worth looking into id appreciate any input on this,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWdEFfeDZodWxYeFhGRll0ak1GX05xSXRVOGVwcHFybDhLLUM2SElVUWlSTGxMWUhGQmprZHNYU2hIVGJTT3RFWS1qMWwzTjBPZDhvVzVRbTJRd3RuZFE9PQ==

yeah i feel i shouldnt have to be doing this much work to convince him but here we are lol my colleague who is a literal definitive genius thinks that in federated learning since we have no access to data we have to build the centralized model with onehot encoding and just keep a count of how many users we would have so then we maintain a table on the users device with that number of columns and just update it every few months but train on that dataset with all of those empty ohe columns its a neural network it will be fine but hes saying that we have to build the most basic version of the model possible we cant generate any synthetic data or acquire any data to build a baseline estimate because that is the point of federated learning i disagree with that and feel a dynamically determined embedding layer based on one or multiple categorical variables that would include userid as a way to distinguish one user from another and making the size of the layer dependent on rangeuserid so it scales properly on the patient device with <number> id or the centralized model with the outputs from whatever number it ends up being would be enough to ensure each user has a chance at receiving a personalized recommendation that would improve over time neither of us is willing to budge lol,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWUngxXzl1eTNZaWZFQkFwRzBoZW9xM1BxQTFoNHVjTjBmT2hKRWc2MGpGbnlSMk96ZDFsR1RLemZKZTFreHZUUXlRbjdWR21aWk9BU3cyQXhYeXlUcGc9PQ==

because youre looking at buckets of promotions and theyre all related you cant use an independent modeled approach because the promotions run on top of each other and theyre usually highly correlated you either get into it using a hierarchical linear regression where coefficients are modeled separately and you create a new dependent variable or you use the hlm which allows you to bucket things consider it a mixed effects regression model if it makes you understand it better edit to add when i ran price and promotion studies at nielsen for manufacturers we often used the hlm to understand either promotional campaigns as the buckets or we ran the types of promotions as their own buckets the point is both tease out the over lapping issues and autocorrelation that you run into when youre looking at promotional effectiveness,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbW8yTHhSLXFfSUlibXdWQ3RaV1M5anNLenU1VkpKNmd6M09MSFJGZ0VNRDVRMVJaTmcyUC1BLWVqQmZscDYzRFRaT0IyTUpLWXlwdXBkbzhKSmVBbVE9PQ==

its the same thing mostly data science really just has more modeling tools in their toolkit from what i see the idea is to be able to alsobut not necessarily exclusively be able to use modeling tools to solve problems also want a strong grasp on the internal statistics but not absolutely necessary google is always your friend but make sure to actually do your research and not just a quick search make sure to find the reasons and logic as to what method you want to use you should do this as a data analyst as well but i think dss are usually held to a higher standardand pay,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWdzlUYmw3WWNJZy1Ca09vYlZCWVYtQV9qNFFRVEh1V2NUWkJ4WkV0QXFVV3FxOURYaDJtNWtVUjFNcjlWb0UzZDdBZDg3OTRLQXZaUUZPbjJoY0NIa1E9PQ==

i definitely agree there is some degree of benefit of implementing algorithms from scratch because often times people dont really have mathematical intuition and just blindly use packages sometimes i lowkey get disappointed because i see data scientists use sklearns implementation of svm but not know what a rbf kernel is or cant derive something trivial like bias variance tradeoff for mse i dont expect ppl to be able to bound the hypothesis space for something like pac learning but they definitely should know the very basics such as why autodiff works and criterions needed for a model to converge,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU3RzX2hmUDhxVElFWW9uMzV1d1BnZUJ4U25fa21HSUNHNjN4bG83SkNzWDVDTHBHWk5kSkN4TnB5MXhmeTNrbHRKd09wZVAwQW1FRDJGNlBYUGFvY3dpazJtRUR0cWlaU05NVXBJSk9vNXc9

data scientists are usually capable of fundamental research but it is not the benchmark for their role like any commercial role the benchmark is profitability and opportunity cost if fundamental research is the most profitable approach then that is what they will do but if using their time on some less scientific approach will more effectively capture value for the business then they will do that instead,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJibmRlVTVTMzRiWTJsTDVWMTBIQ1JrN29rNklwcXM2RzZfTlpsaGZ0ZURqdjRsaEQ2WXh6M0xJaDNTai1yZ1JoYTM0aGZtTTMwU1BBcm9EeTJJbFROQXc9PQ==

my sense at least from the discussion here is that data scientists dont know or dont care about math which is kind of necessary if you want to do scientific research in statistics or machine learning i saw a post about this fresh grad with tons of grad level math courses under his belt from a top school who was not getting interviewed everyone was just harping on him not having work experience internships this was strange because some of the most scientifically oriented firms quant funds or real labs care about the rigor of your education and your raw problem solving ability quant funds dont even care if you have ever done finance before just whether you can solve hard problems i thought that attitude would permeate ds too but it doesnt like standard data analyst internships at places like deloitte where you just do grunt work are far less valuable in my mind than a course on say measure theory which will really test how you think again this is just my opinion having experienced both,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJibnkybGZYRElSVFZWWTdqdnhLTkdjNHA1RnJaZUdVNHhZN1FhR0had3BXcFVPQklCclNQREtUSE1XYkJhb0gwTGpnUWhPWGJCTmxZSGk5ckFxOVl4eUtPWENUcUJfc0E4a2UwRDc2NHp0dUU9

i would reckon there are far more people with business experience and the potential to get through a top mba program than there are people who can get through algebraic geometry or functional analysis with an a just look at how big a math major is at a typical school vs a business major how many people enroll in one vs the other,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiT0cyNGRock0tTHVjd2RhaTFYTG9xOHpNQnRFaU5yY01FUGF2MG9JMXdGY1hxZlIwOHJjRm16RnA3ektvYUwyczBlMWdhbVlhNUhGYzQyUjUyTUFLWXlWa3lxMENBNzdmRVlBdVZydW1qSUU9
what an idiotic comment im a neuroscientist i learned to be a data science and engineering by working with fmri data and coming up through experience the difference between bullshit and knowledge is easy to spot for those thar understand the field and have experience delivering the work what you describe sounds like a vanilla consultant and i have yet to find the consultant who can deliver on a data team by themselves,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJicTBFMXhfUDFyeHZPdVZCcHVlTTMtMU1hbExNODhfMVhjRS11OWE2MFR3enFzVUM3UktGY0pXelRTdlJlOG5Hak96TGozcHBPWF9lSEh6eGNFUzl4VUE9PQ==

its not about science vs business experience its about science + business experience universities churn out a massive oversupply of graduates capable of doing the scientific part of the role so hiring managers are able to be picky and expect candidates to have the soft skills as well,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJibS16cEVCcXV3QnlIZ0tBSVpfZElNaGlVRzA5WXQtX3EyYThvQlhoT3NjV3UybklNZzZsUVlkRGUwOFVaTzkycks0LTlzQndnMld6YktMLVJDeUhhV2c9PQ==
my point is that universities churn out far more people with business skills all the econ and business majors in the world only have soft skills to sell and they get hired in hordes at banks or in consulting or sales positions which makes sense a typical businessecon major at typical us universities is usually at least x bigger than a math major and at some top schools its even x bigger quant funds seem to not have trouble recruiting from this inflated pool of people with technical skills just set the bar high,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJibkJvQnZNSTR3Yl9KX1ZNYjN4MXlsblN4dGU0eWVJNkprYnkwV1pPR3RWVHNOWGJlTjdkMXJTeHM4YXA1NjRUOEI0bFk4MnBxYl9aWjNnc0RXSVBCbG9iODNpTHlCWjNmMWR0TTgyRC1JNEk9

they are running a lot of regressions broadly construed that too without much domain knowledge since these funds dont care much for practical or academic knowledge of finance they just want you to be fast know how to code not necessarily deploy and be good at probability and statistics they pay boatloads of money to fresh grads with not much experience how do these fresh grads generate value you think <url> this kind of profile is ignored by ds but i think is really good to have on a team of smart people you can learn all that faff about communication on the job this is what quant recognizes and ds doesnt columbia + uchicago with a gazillion grad math courses is gonna get you an interview somewhere in that world,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJieFNjVTE4TEVoUThqM0dzcngzNTlDMmZyMGhDdGFkeXlwUjhOUXdjRTNMdEQ5RFVtOTZVaUJqZ0lrMEZBcGNHTThKT3NuNk5sYnR3RUxHbkFxYzhSbDNwdnJkWlRTVDZfUVBzeTJJR0dGVGM9

i dont think your statement is controversial at all especially since data scientists become more and more focused on swe skills since people have realised that a bunch of overpaid model builders and notebook scramblers do not add business value as long as they cannot put anything into production people will argue that they do science because they use the scientist method but this highlights more the incomplete understanding of stem graduates what science really is you analyse you pick a solution you test its quality and put it into production in my book this is engineering not science but since the title data engineer is already preoccupied with a different set of tasks and skills we now have to roll with the term data scientist,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiSTkya2hJQ3VwS3pRRmdsdnZXd3poRTFjSUhZaXpVY0d5aHJ5d19CU2hTbEtnbDFxMVBNcmlpcHR1NGZRUEpmM2tnSlk1c3lPZmJjNmdXM2ktV3J1dmc9PQ==
the problem is that a lot of especially older professionals think that sorting and plotting big amounts of data can be considered data science out lab had an environmental monitoring project with an institute involved that did the work on the data we got the final report and with nice plots in it our head of the department told everyone even on confereces this institute used data science to analyze two years of the monitoring after reading the python files i realised what they did was only sorting an grouping huge amounts of data they interpolated missing data with linear interpolation using pandas they then performed some math on the level of elementary school they then plotted some nice diagramms using matplotlib seaborn that was all and everyone called it data science and thats the problem in my option people are mixing up data engeneering handling and plotting big data for example with data science where for me scientifical methods and therories are applied to the data to get new insights or proofe theories i often export data to pandas sort and filter this data do basic calculations and plot it for reports but i would never consider myself a data scientist when the head of our department would talk about my work with data i guess he would tell everyone that i am an analytical chemist who is also a data scientist he just does not unterstand that i am using pandas matplotlib because i dont like to do excel with more that <number> rows of data ,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQmZHQlREazlxUll0azBtek41el90MmZ6UlFEd19jNVJXZ1BZZWJYU2tiLXRkX1FxRXNNdk5waE1ZU28zZVhkTm1KS2pxT2pTZTk5T1A2aWRNWXRfOFE9PQ==
people who studied any types of engineering are called engineers people who studied mathematics are called mathematicians and those who studied statistics are called statisticians and those who studied biology are called biologists now those who studied computer science can be called a what exactly programmers some of them dont like to be called like that and those who studied data science are what exactly could be called computational statisticians or statistician programmers etc but none of these are accepted terms so what remains is computer scientist data scientist until someone invents a better term machine learning engineer is such a term but as a matter of fact data analytics data science degrees are not called engineering degrees and as such real engineers could complain that data scientists are not real engineers and it is true data scientists are closer to mathematicians and they are de facto computational statisticians so not really engineers anyway it doesnt matter it is just a job title get used to it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiTzJ0UGx3c0M5dUo1SFBSYTYyZ3R1bldNSzhST0t0STgzdnNCZkRDN3VJUWdrV0hCdDdCWXVNbXpLR3dFQ2FZUzh2MzhuNTg0dGlYV04zVHFGVmFHZ1d0YTdGaVBQNk1XT0x2M1piTWFFMEU9
yeah i think you hit the nail on the head i guess what i was concerned about was this rapid shift away from real research teams to turning everyone into engineers whats the point of having an mlops person if they cant take the cutting edge estimator written by a stats phd and deploy it it will be pointless and a waste of money and time to make that stats phd now become competent in terraform kubernetes docker and cicd everyone on this sub is constantly pissed at scientists who cant deploy when they dont understand that scientists are not engineers and vice versa even many seasoned software engineers are not familiar with the full devops mindset and the tools that facilitate it in practice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQzNBVEJsUmQ4ZGxkb3FvM0dCbFhua2JlUVlMOTk4ZEZPMm0xLXlmRWJ6LWNTWE5xMFRndkZWM2RIZGd5ZUZqNnhseTBFcER3LVBycTRic3NMS293dDBoQVBXeDdKWmtGMTVzUW9waWo1ZDg9

thats true in math you learn techniques to analyze things that will blow your mind you learn how to prove things and how to solve problems but if you want to find a job you need another degree or you have to work in academia for example i work as a software engineer but i have studied math and physics thats probably the fate of most mathematicians,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiYk95VjNMNnJXY09oNzF0U0Rma2lrYmtuRk9LQnJ6enJ0dFRueWo5TjU5Y0NNU1NOVXRuUG8yR2M4NHdVcFFqdFJxMV9WTUJrZUw0OWZzUXpKZTdJLWc9PQ==

karl poppers positivism is the key difference in science you cant really prove something but you can reject competing hypotheses for a phenomena in other words science proceeds via negative rejection slaying one idea at a time until the best or at least most resistant to falsification cough string theory cough are left standing ai follows a drastically different path in which money flows to leverage massive computing power to validate a vision generative ai is even weirder we construct new positives through association so in this sense the term data scientist actually would mean the opposite of what the job actually entails i imagine if popper had heard the term hed assume youd spend most of your time demonstrating what cant be done with the data though i dont want anyone to take this as if data scientists are somehow lesser imo the strenuous process of crossvalidation and data withholding are marks of better discipline than most scientists practice i once tried to publish a paper using ai to show that a commonly accepted theory was inadequate to form predictions and the peer reviewers werent able to comprehend cross validation they called it fake data i do think there is room for a more rigorous concept of the scientist part of the word but as long as most development occurs because of vc money and short term goals the data part will be primary,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiVl9IcDM3My1URUFTUlNzV192MW0zLW0xMlhvYkZ4Z08yOHRXUmlJbUd6czMyWDBBVVVtMkt3UW9iTWc1S3VuRUE5ZVloMER3Tm5ucC1lSHpoU0FaZnc9PQ==

dont waste your time building out a github portfolio theres only a small chance a hiring manager will even look at it the best thing you can do is get experience through proposing and completing novel projects at your job because that way youre getting paid to learn new things and if the project is successful you can add that as a talking point in your resumeinterview if youre the one who came up with the idea and led the initiative that looks really good and you can also build a lot of leadership skills which could be helpful if you want to transition into management as far as the worklife tradeoff thing goes absolutely do not sacrifice your weekendsevenings or family time for work but if you find yourself with a couple hours with nothing to do consider stepping away from the computertv and maybe read a book about something youd like to learn about workrelated doing the ms might be worth the time sink though will help you stand out and give you some useful knowledge and better to do it now when you are young and with relatively few responsibilities rather than later,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiTWJSRkJOaVFrdGM3RmRQNTBRaWw3cHdKaHQyTkk5Ykhpd3FrY01tNFp6b1BpVVZ3NUZiSkVla1FCOS1aNUVCT3RjM1FBamNFajZLY3pNY2FkUXk3WHc9PQ==

bit late but i come from a scientific background biotech and i think this has really helped me think about problems in a different way to other people on the teams ive been on the more i progressed the less i used the normal libraries that youd typically use as a data scientist and went more into putting things into production swe at the end of the day data science is an iterative process just like being at the lab try a model based on some intuition if it works keep it and move on i suppose anyone can do this and it doesnt require understanding how to multiply two matrices i have since forgotten all the math involved because im not in research when i was in biology i worked on bacteria i didnt need to know every bacteria on earth to do research and i certainly knew nothing about the cellular processes of the bacteria i was working with if the bacteria turns green good no color change approach likewise i view data science in the same way as you progress you get a certain intuition for when to use boosting or how many layers you need to make something happen,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJielRMeTBVTl8yR2JNR1d0cVRLRjVoZnNXYlFRNkZYRU9Sb0NVODF6OW9Wb1B3YmJTbkgwMlF1aHE3MnVIcEtiajNIRDJ3dWJUR25nSU16TjFKdlNPTnc9PQ==

theyre definitely over utilized at the moment meaning they are applied to a lot of use cases where they arent really suitable but no they are not just hype its an incredible piece of technology and absolutely constitute a serious break through in the field i do think they are still quite simple compared to what they will probably be capable of in <number><number> years though the entire field of machine learning is really only a decade or <number> old even if the mathematics behind most of these models has existed for much longer we are still looking at the tip of the iceberg imo,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiOXRTSTZiM3NqbnpuMXc3c0dqb1BsYkJkV0RPSGdqX3lIX1BhSTJDWEhjTW9FWV9IMXRGTFJ5Wlc1aFNILThxbmRKRkVIRU82MEFveWlxWEVUSXNUQUE9PQ==

agree to disagree i think the hyper specific contexts are where humans will shine llms can recognize patterns but are unable to attribute patterns to causes nor figure out which patterns found actually matter correlation is their strong suit not causation knowing the business context and connecting it to whats going on has always been and will be infinite to be the main benefit data scientists provide also the point at which we get to generalized models that know everything in specific contexts is extremely far off ip has to deteriorate to a ridiculous extent for that to happen right now well see many many specialized retrained or embedded models to do some of the mid level processing but nothing generalized will come out unless a valid training dataset somehow is formed of all necessary dataextremely unlikely in mid term,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJidVdhMVNFOUc5QjZEYmx1X3l2czJYWUpzdkhRVzhQMnJMTER0WXFLRjM2NUtNVEIzclYtNEhqaFU4VFVVX3NMazRtNnV5MTdGeWpHbTh3VTZ3bHJZYlE9PQ==

this is exactly what was said about llms being able to write complete sentences and coherent paragraphs before gpt then all of that was blown out of the water by simply scaling up the current architectures there is no reasonable way to justify a statement like yours right now we can only see if continuing to scale things up gets us closer to agi it is an open empirical question and anyone expressing certainty on the topic is confused,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjaFQtY1k1bFZ4dzJ0bEczcnZzWDkySTN5RExrTW1mMWFFNVN4ZzdCNm90VjlrdEpQTTh5MkxxTjhjY19MdTl5Y0pkRnlzVkR1Ym93c1J1VERaX0VhMG0wQnhKcFhrTW11eHF3X3V2aTROLXc9

that is great i agree with you on the generalized capabilities of it what i am referring to it not being an agi is its reasoning ability it could also be a lack of tools for humans to understand how the under the hood model learns not in a mathematical way but in a more philosophical sense for example clip models the dense layer in between the encoderdecoder is basically just a compressed representation of general concepts of the image and the text related to the image given it ideally has no understanding of the full context of what things there another example that was given in the computerphile link on the article talks about the models ability to distinguish between cats and dogs however the model does not have a very deep understanding of various types of cat species which is referring to the fact that the model is only as good as the data it is fed and if the model is truly defined by the data it is fed then i fail to understand the agi part of the model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQnFUNTVoZHg5c3BuSWtOODFBNVdwTHdOeF9rRjFSa2tNR0FJS1FjQmpfc1dXNG1zYzY3X01iaHZTQnFNSkU3V0ZsOUxaT3pSM1FmekFPakoybk9Nbnc9PQ==

it feels like a significant and important stepping stone to something more transformative which so far i think e can only see the following aspects of as being a sure thing <number> a very natural and intuitive humancomputer interface natural language is the new and hottest programming language as andrew kerpathy once said i think this will become even more apparent when multimodal models that can understand and respond in expressive speech become more prevalent such as gpto and any other systems currently training on this endtoend multimodal architecture <number> systems that can automate or at least make very efficient and accessible various kinds of highly cognitive tasks such as homework tutoring longtext analysis etc <number> agentic system too early to tell what this will look like but it seems like the general llm lmm lam landscape is evolving in this direction so i dont think llms are hype in what they represent a significant milestone in making machines that dont just follow human instruction but are capable of some degree of understanding human intention behind the instructions the foundation of systems that will be far more intelligent autonomous and intuitive to interface with but as of this current moment if we stayed totally frozen where we are in llm development adoption integration then yes its not transformative on its own not for most people at least in short i think the hype is justified assuming that neural network and cognitive architecture research training and development continue on the same pace but what we have now feels like the first webpages of the <number>s or the first capacities touch screen phones of <number>s the implications of the first generation of this tech science are not quite clear yet but one can reasonably presume they are big,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJja2VKR3ZoakJUZzhPR1FRNlZGWGZPaWNkTWZoSWIzMFpjOEtRNThGNExidmxMVmNUT2xoMVQ0cU5Kd2ZzVVRjZG55N2luNFZVNGw4VF91SG43Y0hLTVE9PQ==

they are language models that mimic humans and humans make mistakes they work very well in terms of using a language for example revise a paragraph write a story or summarize an article but for other tasks eg solving math problems or logic problems you need more than a pure language model a model trained towards that direction just like people people who are trained to write good articles may not be able to solve hard math problems without proper math training,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjTzVmVDJTNVQzdlphVUFiaXFYNWl5YktEM1BZYWU5X1dRVU5oMFBSenZKazZpRjc4bDZVQnVTbDQydVFiZ3I2aThOUkVMdkRNd3UzaGdUdG9YeURlWFE9PQ==

yeah and each big release has a declining rate of improvement and by this i mean actual improvement for every day use not theoretical numbers of a chart dont get me wrong llms are important and a fundamental shift in humancomputer interaction honestly i could see them replacing traditional search engines in the near future that being said ive seen all the graphs which show the capabilities of these models increasing up and to the left i think this models are really up and to the right in my every day work they are better than the last update but each update is more and more underwhelming the writing level is around a upperclass high school student and has been for a while take for example cars cars have been getting more efficient for a while in terms of energy consumption per unit of distance but they archived this efficiency piece meal over multiple iterations that was true until a fundamental change was introduced the hybridelectric vehicle llms will continue to improve but i dont expect any huge advancements any time soon i also think that llms are hitting a wall in terms of added value a wall that simply throwing more computing power will not solve yes we this technology was just introduced and there are going to be many great apps built on it but the internal engine the llm has largely be designed and only marginal improvements can be made to its ability to deliver value,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNmg0dlU2dWVKZWlIYXRHa2FmWGt0aFhneUhqb0dTVmduY0RUMEltTVUyM2UxYkRxT09JaWhFNEtUX3BuVjNZY2lGNG1jcVdiSmFYSzUxdndXekd1VGc9PQ==

it doesnt know any of those things because there is no thought and no reasoning in the model it is very good at outputting the same words that someone intelligent would write but its just statistical correlation its impressive until you look closer partially because humans read charitably and try to interpret the meaning behind writing which leads us to credit it with more understanding than it actually has but there are lots of little cracks once you look deeper which show that it clearly isnt reasoning as a simple example ask it to count the number of words in a paragraph or write a paragraph with a certain number of words occasionally it will get it right on accident but none of the models can do this consistently and most consistently get it wrong because it isnt reasoning its just outputting words that are statistically likely to go together,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjSC0xXzJXUFdScnFfV2dBS29tbTZIV2stVGtnQ1QyajVzUVhPYnlvUWVmdVJQSzVSVjVHbFdhWUs0RUdrOVl3SHhIQmRXeGFPMTJSNnc3TkpIWU5wTlE9PQ==

whats weird now that im thinking about it is that i was pretty skeptical when it first became popular and have mostly remained that way since i love telling people its overhyped lol but somehow along the way ive been using it more and more for a ton of different things i do both for work and just for fun like i have zero experience coding as in i really really dont know how to code but using the gpt models over the past few months ive coded a bunch of stuff ive created a scheduling app for my work ive built an android app that listens to business meetings and instantly spits out a professional bullet point summary of the meeting afterwards ive scraped some subreddits and have done all kinds of cool python based data analysis like turning comments into embedded vector files and doing tsne pca reduction analysis have no clue if im using these words right also dont really care its just for fun for me and seeing the general trends opinions tone controversial topics of that subreddit and then graphing it against other subreddits to see the biggest differences in all of those things ive made fun little computer games for my nephews ive made bots that chat and argue back and forth with each other about whatever topics using different llms ive made a personal email bot ive made a bunch of different websites and designs just for fun another helpful thing i use it for is to have it straight up tell me why im wrong i like discussing philosophy especially philosophy of mind and consciousness and ive entered a bunch of different essays and long comments ive written over the years into llms and have them tell me everything they think im getting wrong which tbh is super useful it can take a lot of time to figure out whats wrong with your deepest held beliefs on your own because after all you wouldnt believe them if you didnt think they were good ideas but having a chatbot who isnt a person that wants to argue or call you an idiot just straight up tell you why youre wrong and give as many resources to prove it as you want its actually pretty exciting and useful i dont know if any of this is groundbreaking or revolutionary to me personally but i have been using it more and more and in ways i didnt think i would just a year ago so idk,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjc1NibHZZUWUwdkZmWVpxN2dRSFJUbFo1eWZSbkl4RW52R21WZG9jM3ZyUkE1V09ZNi1md1VYcXhoOVlUSHdlc1k4dXFPaE92QVVMc3Q5dUFSdzdOZWJueVdKRF9CbGh0dkNMSEtnU1pEZVE9

i wouldnt consider it hype in the same way nfts were aiml will need stronger models before it can become a huge part of human life and if i were a vp at microsoft or google id encourage my team to enhance the statistical models rather than just build more use cases for llm but id definitely consider it a huge accomplishment in human history id ask my non technical teams to get acquainted with chatgpt and how to use it as a tool and not a crutch itll also be a moment in history you read about in text books,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjcUp3YVZoSWZPWm9IcktCY1JQZ3V6YW9WaFM1QXpkTXJGS2tyNGJmQ1FmajRkYkdTNmVpaGVxb05xdW91dndNWlprLXRFY3NPMlBuVkFpUXhvX3Zpa3c9PQ==

indeed however while or is present in most industries in one way or another it could be considered less broad than ds simply because there are things that or does not do that many would consider part of ds an example of this would be natural language text processing which would be considered ds and may be used as part of an or problem but in and of itself is not or unless linked to a goal of improving a larger system or process or has been around for a very long time and has a pretty well understood meaning whereas ds nowadays is basically just rebranding any use of statistics from wikipedia data science is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics scientific computing scientific methods processes algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from potentially noisy structured or unstructured data operations research encompasses the development and the use of a wide range of problemsolving techniques and methods applied in the pursuit of improved decisionmaking and efficiency,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjcng0bUZONGtPVXJRejdLdFRRZDFSb3NKOTQwbEh1bC0weUF1ZThzOG1UQno0dlFXckRLeG50V2dyVkZyUV9RcUQxUDFqb21BVUpWYnAtOTJIM3JpdWVlb1NyU3lHVWFicFB6dk1paUtfWWs9

i would define an intelligent agent as one that can reason from first principles to complex conclusions synthesise new knowledge from antecedent facts and understand the world from simple observation and known laws of nature humans can reliably do all these things other animals can do some of them or do them to some degree llms cannot do any of them we are denegrating intelligence by assigning it to statistical prediction this is not to say that we might not get a useful approximation of intelligence with this approach which is what we are observing now much like how a calculator is not intelligent but is vastly superior at math than any human,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjLXFKRTNWNU9VSTljemxkNl9vTTZJVFhfR25DZW8xMF9Hb1V6RGd5YmxTdThkSFNnazNacmZPRnV6Rl80cjgyUHlhSmJDLVRpR1Q4c3Byc0d1RGEtUmc9PQ==

eh in my fairly substantial by now experience this isnt exactly a panacea discrimination involving choosing between multiple outputs is decent but simple self critique is poor and requires a lot of hand holding i have added llm validators w instructor to my classifier and quite often the initial guess is right and the validator is wrong or the initial guess is wrong and the validator just waves it through this is from hundreds of dollars of gpt api calls that ive hand checked at every stage id say in my hands on average llm self validation is a slight net positive but adds a good bit to costs so whether its worth it depends on constraints it helps if you learn the kinds of mistakes the model tends to make in your task and point those out explicitly in the validator call,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjaWhnSVlOWkw5TWNzanlVLTNQUVY5X3BYLVg2SUhqdjJQWkRweEs1YU5Ja0pUc05vU0FvTk4tcUc4V3ZhNlZTNHRtS0UwOTFYb0p1akx0TE9yLVFnaXc9PQ==

i cant stand the is just next word prediction or is just statistic line of thought yes your brain then is just electric signals nobody could have predicted that just by optimizing for predicting next word you would learn basic math problem solving theory of mind these llms are learning intelligence by reverse engineering language and they are converging towards the most efficient way to do so that is probably intelligence how do we know because evolution converged there to and probably what we have discovered is that language and intelligence are strongly connected and empathy too for example that explaining tom as emergent capabilities because we have an intuition of the architecture that doesnt mean we know what these language model are nobody knows how tom works in our minds the same way nobody knows how it works in an llm it doesnt make you look smart downplaying the potential of llm it makes you look like you are not understanding the potential reach i agree that by themselves they wont reach full agi because they lack a physical world representation that may prove very hard to reverse engineer from language although not impossible but a mixture of models may get there and multimodal llms will still be probably the main course of the agi meal,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjU1JyT3F1LWp4VnU2TTZwWVZOekNHcTNJUTd0MlNVSDN2VWF1QVlRd21yTlA2Zzl6dVJRT2JTdUVPeWJZT19hUXZYQXRmZHZfOHBWeERHTU12UVVLamc9PQ==

i do not believe you provided the best comparison but i respect what you are trying to say ai research output and competing for ds jobs are two wildly different things as long as you are an academic some phd in an academic organization there is theoretically a limitless number of publicationsresearch projects you can produce as long as you can secure that funding and other stuff but not enough jobs for everyone to become a data scientist regardless of overseas andor foreign competition the second item is that the competition aspect of the comment alone is not what elicits xenophobia i feel that i should clarify some of the points of my comment <number> i said borderline xenophobic but for the sake of argument lets look at a definition xenophobia is the dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries from oxford languages this definition is in line with several others from other dictionary sources so now what makes this comment borderline xenophobic the op unnecessarily mentioned their lack of an accent in conjunction with competition from asia implying superiority in communication acumen to their supposed competitors it is the combination of the two that implies that the op sees themselves as superior to asian data scientists and data scientists from other continents in communication skills because of their potential dislike of their accents among potentially other items but i will not make accusations that surpass the evidence if they didnt why even bring up accents in the first place makes no sense at all to do so even if its not xenophobic it is disrespectful this violates rule one of this subreddit <number> ops comments were completely off topic for their goal op shouldve just asked about what data science jobs are highly statistically rigorous but op went on a weird tangent and became the subreddits next meme unrelated to my comment you can ignore this if you want but i do want to address this because i have seen some antiasian sentiment in other subreddits and i really would hate for that to start here there has been competition from asian nationals for itcompsci jobs for decades it comes in waves new companies become successful they lay people off they outsource a number of jobs they hire foreign nationals claiming to lack native talent newer companies emerge etc it is not the fault of asian nationals who want good jobs it is the greed of large corporations,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjTG1Xanl2d2JhMTJkWjZRVXZ2TW9DVk9ueDhSZmRKMktfNllxck5hVGhUM2hnSDlPQVJ4WXRvbnE2eEpxVWo5Z2FlSC0wMVZfSjFVckwwZlhuLWJHTlE9PQ==

hi everyone i am a <number>yearold physicist from chile currently living in the usa with both a bachelors and a phd who lacks confidence in applying for data science roles because i feel i dont fully grasp all the foundational concepts i have a diploma in python applied to data science where i learned the basics of data manipulation visualization and analysis i gained proficiency in libraries such as numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn and scikitlearn as well as the fundamentals of machine learning including algorithms like regression classification and clustering i was considering enrolling in the online master of science in analytics omsa at georgia tech but now that i am moving to vienna austria i am contemplating applying to the master in data science program at tu wien i feel very confused about what to do do you think one masters program is better than the other the core courses of omsa are interdisciplinary covering basics such as computing for data analysis introduction to analytics modeling and business fundamentals for analytics as well as advanced topics like data and visual analytics data analytics in business and computational data analysis additionally students can choose four elective courses and complete a practicum on the other hand the tu wien programs foundations are structured around fundamentals of data science machine learning and statistics big data and high performance computing and visual analytics and semantic technologies this includes courses such as dataoriented programming paradigms experiment design for data science statistical computing advanced methods for regression and classification machine learning advanced database systems dataintensive computing cognitive foundations of visualization and information visualization moreover students have the opportunity to choose electives from different areas and complete a <number> ect thesis along with additional credits focusing on domainspecific aspects of data science the tu wien program appears to offer a more structured approach with a focus on foundational principles while the omsa program provides flexibility and a broader range of elective options in terms of cost the omsa program is priced at <cur><number> usd while the tu wien program costs approximately <number> euros for the two years i would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you can offer to help me make this decision thank you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNVhrTFBpVE45bEltR2ZQeW5TQk90aVRCRzdDN1hOUWpPTWpBV051MjhLaWtfMDNTMktlWlUxaGdMenFOYlJOTmowc3M2aHFlMW01RXJLYkl5NFhXMTk4SnhqbkQzNUJBazZCVmpuQWFHbTQ9

i recognize that this conversation was frustrating for you and i saw in another thread that you found chatgpt code that let you do the curve fitting you were trying to do fair enough but its worth mentioning that the other commenters here were trying to point you toward the fact that there are a bunch of different models built to solve this situation using probability theory etc that will almost certainly work better and have fewer failure points than an ad hoc simulation a reference point for this better class of solutions is poisson process which might not be the right model family for you but at least gets things rolling its possible that in your situation it isnt worthwhile to learn the ideal solution and that putting together something homemade is simply faster for you such is life but for most people in most situations getting the solution that is more robust and longlasting and often already implemented is the better choice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjT0RaUlNPWURVUUlHV3VWSF9jX1JFYUViS2ZzelJXb2gyTDYxNGdVajdINVZwY04zS2F3OGp2RGJZQ2JvLVhVOW5GVXBYMW5hMG84VjlFZHRHcFJvQ0E9PQ==

lab sciences are very bureaucratic because being a pi then means being a lab administrator and fund raiser i think sciences like stats and economics are better in that they dont usually follow the lab model but work with data and produce empirical findings and more crucially produce new methodologies my use of the word science in this post here is colloquial its more of a shorthand for rigorous mathematically sophisticated research oriented roles which are admittedly in short supply im an econ phd student who has luckily landed a tenure track offer we dont usually postdoc in econ but i suppose i would have taken an uber or lyft economist role which are primarily research based if i had gotten those hiring is way down for such roles since i wouldnt have to move but a role where all i do is tinker with cloud infrastructures would bore the hell out of me and my sense is that data science is becoming itswe oriented,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNHphVEJqZWdyREE1Yk5GVDNMWXpwMzlONTNjd2d5aENFWWdsU2VKcWJMc2FHelI2MHJMZURvMWRiRlowR09GX1l2Vllzb1J1b1hseTZwYlhkS2VxeUVYbUU0VTl0OE1pRGZvbWJvTzlSTTQ9

hi i have a phd in bioengineering and currently am a postdoc in computational modeling process engineering at a major pharma company my previous postdoc was centered on bioinformatics but really not rigorous enough to become an expert in the field my thesis was centered on using ml to predict cancer drug response in cell culture i currently have <number> first author publications in bioinformatics type journals with several additional second author publications in the postdoc i am currently in i was really hoping to gain some solid ai experience but so far that hasnt panned out i have been thinking to transitioning to more ds roles but when i apply i dont even get a screening interview it has left me thinking about doing a ds masters but a lot of the courses and subject material ie statistics r python traditional machine learning svm regularized regression gps tree based methods clustering etc ive already been exposed to and it seems a waste of time and money my other thought were to take a graduate certificate program specifically in ai but my free time is limited the third option i was thinking was doing some projects i am interested in a making a webpage with tutorials but again free time is limited and i dont necessarily have the computational resources for deep learning though aws might be an option my kind of final option is that staying at my position for the next year will give me some name recognition because i work for big pharma in a computational role and figure out how to better sell myself i just know currently i am not getting enough satisfaction out of my job or growing enough i like computational work and thus ds seems like a good fit i also dont necessarily want to stay in biotech because i would like to move back to colorado and it seems opportunities are limited compared to the coasts any suggestions would be great thanks,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZlZjMk1sc25WU1d6dkpqOGxWUTM3OE96eDBWSWpURlpGTDl6RFdVck9YQU1TRTJjdHU4a0xCeGFPTTlLOEdnUGJrWTQ1S1drblB6amEzYjBUeThBcTlNRWRPOC1uS2NkUE5KdjJYQVp6NVE9

if i were you and all i wanted to do was to add dependence on previous predictions i would try a quick and dirty workaround add the previous time points prediction as a feature and turn your lgbm into an autoregressive model maybe even two timepoints its still gonna be <number> calls to the model but at least you introduced some sound reasoning to your modeling in terms of training this model i would use the true values of the previous timestamp with some added noise look at the distribution of your current predictions and find some random distribution or combination thereof thats got a similar shape and add it to the feature during training,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjclZwaWZZb180UnktNGNSdFItQjUtbHdvMlNwYl9kdm8xSDFPbE9JMmgtby1PelF2eEs2RFk2X01mUHN3WXdlekpwd2t0V21ua0hKZE93Q3U4MnBZOVE9PQ==
yup you can know what task you need to perform and spend months of thinking through related problems and doing research on it then you ask a basic question to perform the next step and a redittor will say before i even entertain this question explain to me the last several months of work you did before i will even consider this rudimentary next step as valid like no dude i just need the names of several curve mapping methods and names of methods of evaluating the fitness of those curves,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjSHZyNVFFaTRTWkFXY3o0bFZGM2ZwQlp3emt1UmdMS3VoMjhQOWtpVHNGTmh5WFVWRGZ2WnZQa000YnI4b01kdEo1YlJ6LVJNbXkwcUZsaWFUZjMzQXhpVjNPcE9HaWJfdktaSDN6Q25YMTA9

tbf if you classify a scientist as someone with a phd in stem i would say thats not a very high bar in terms of mathematical rigor either you can get a phd in most physicalsocial sciences with undergrad or lower maths skills even doing a phd in say mechanical engineering does not give you a solid understanding of neutral networks especially not the software part of it ie python etc at the end of the day my belief is that someone is a data scientist if they can break down complex problems into questions answerable with data then solve those questions using ml or other analytical methods,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNk5rOVNwaGVTVUQ4LWVfWU5LcTZhb0E5QW01VEVmTnZlYng5T09JLVNGeTNCdHI0ekpGbC1tOUd4QUFMRkc2NFZxazFVaGZxTFJmcTVTR3Zram5mZ1E9PQ==
yup the bar is only high for mathstatsphysicsecon phds because most of the other sciences including physics to a great extent have been swallowed up by the lab model where papers are pumped out by massive teams rather than written by a small group of scholars its not practical to kick people out for failing quals or admit only the best when you need underpaid labor to do grunt work in labs math is not strictly speaking a science but maths influence on stats and econ is the only reason these fields remain rigorous there was a substantial effort to axiomatize both these fields in the th century which ensures theres a unified core of knowledge and standards for training econ phds typically come in with background in graduate level real analysis and point set topology and so do stats phds which ensures some minimum standards of quality in matriculating phd classes,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNmZobU56Q0IyVkx6MFRNNmpDYW9LcHhvZi1hcTJqbEY3X2xuWGNkb2FKNVVnQ2VVMGxoVWlpUW10eXZfOXJ3QlFFUVJMOHlxWXBiQjdMb3FaRF9RWWh1WGJEWHhlNzNfN1ZPOG5aM0tFVmM9
comparing to consultants is a little harsh i agree ds is a broad term that has become inundated with business professionals however its that the science skills arent really that unique people on this sub are usually science heavy the reason we stress the business skills is because it differentiates most if you can be a stem graduate and communicate with business professionals you can set yourself above others i recently had this conversation with my manager sometimes its less about how smart you are and more about how well you can sell an idea to stakeholders,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZXRWOXB2TEotcWY0TThXcHRMVVI1c3k5RlNSQmpnZXNXZ1FiZk1QMWJDNV92YXB5NS0tTkRaRlU0NDVXS3lIeVNiMXM5OE1pWmhqNEExd0RScU1yZXc9PQ==

there are certainly many transferable skills between being a data analyst and a data engineer and it could be a good idea to start as a data analyst and work your way up to data engineering but you do not need to be a proficient data analyst to be a data engineer you do need to be a proficient data analyst to be a proficient analytics engineer though to be honest every data job is kinda saturated with people who want to work in the field at the moment we will see how this changes i would say that the amount of people who can do analytics engineering well is not common i also personally believe most companies need far more data engineers than what i have seen hired here is a link that talks about analytics engineering <url><url> and by the way several of these roles do offer sponsorship best of luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjYmlBQWdTMGVvb0p5eWNGQ0VkbW9XS2JqcWYxRTV6RnZQRkVEMjhtejhtTURBSGNqUzVSMHB3RE1DN0ZzeTZiRjNCZkluRGN2dUNRb2hCeDBqYTRZeHc9PQ==

theres really no other way to say it clearly the whole attitude that gets someone to i am going to ignore this simple question and instead appoint myself to consult on and redo the entire project is beyond unreasonable arrogant and rude a simple answer would be mapping weibull distributions tends to handle time until x situations pretty well maybe you can try that scipy has some utilities that are built for this im not sure about your use case though so be careful with it but instead the humans decided they wanted to answer questions like is this method the best way to handle this scenario and is mapping a curve even appropriate for this data and not the question that was asked nothing you can say is going to make discarding a request and appointing oneself to fully reexamine a problem defensible whereas gpto says heres a dozen methods all were more or less reasonable heres the package that maps them yep that was what i was looking for thanks and it exists and does the thing heres the resulting curve over a histogram for visual reference heres a couple ways to test fitness after research all were correct and valid ways of evaluating fitness for this task all of this for what is a lowpriority side project i am working on at home for professional development reasons,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjRGRPS2lGaWRZbkdEY0Fvd25qNm82cWFBYUlQWDZJTThyTVhlcEFMMUxWSE1mZVBpQWhCQkI2V3lBNWFOTm8xd19GNTcyVlkwZHNVODhpa2h0VGJadVhXbEZMTTN3eVhtVFM5WnkzZDVHN1U9

> the humans just didnt know its ridiculous to claim that no one in a thread full of data scientists knows how to structure a simulation if everyone is asking for more information you didnt provide enough this is exactly why chatgpt is dangerous as a knowledge source evaluating its output requires enough expertise to do some basic fact checking and enough to formulate the question properly to begin with and this is exactly where the difficulty lies when youre a beginner most of the work in consulting is just trying to get the client to formulate the question properly to begin with and its extremely common for people to ask for advice about how to implement the model they think the need to implement instead of explaining the actual problem theyre trying to solve your question was a perfect example of this problem since even if some kind of curve fitting approach was reasonable it would be impossible to actually select a procedure without more information about the specific problem so it is flatly impossible that chatgpt provided a reasonable answer unless you provided it with more information than you provided in your post and it would be impossible to evaluate its answer unless you already knew enough about these procedures to understand when and how they should be used,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQlJ0MjBRcHMySk5lNVhBM25sSThJOVZMd1FZQ213LTI1WDY0c0N2alJIcndDc0VPYy13Ny0tbngzNHJnMEh3Sml2SUh0UEF5Z1hlWXYxOVBvRFpkOVE9PQ==

this interested me too so i looked around dont know if this is what youre looking for but i guess the intuition is this when the values of beta are small the coefficients approximately match the percentage change in the dependent variable to see this take lny = beta + betax + some error now for a small change in x delx it can be seen that lnynewyold = betadelx suppose the change in x is <number> unit then e^ynewyold = e^beta for beta = <number> ynewyold is approximately <number> you can see how its useful in a percentage change sense for higher values of beta i see that the approximation doesnt hold this can be attributed to the taylor expansion of e^x = <number> + x + x^<number><number> + x^<number><number> + for small values of x the higher order terms can be ignored not so much when x is large,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZENNUVo0MWVYS3Z0X28wbHB0ellNbXBsM0U2MnQtS3J5RTBxTVppdXlRZlY3cVk0aTFvQzh0Ti13aDN4aFF4aXNaa1VSMWVBdk9GMDZSZGdVNXEybXc9PQ==
the coefficient estimates in a loglevel model logged outcome untransformed regressors have approximately a percent interpretation for example a coefficient estimate of <number> can be interpreted as a one unit change in x is associated with a <number> percent increase in y this only holds for small coefficient estimates log log and level log have different interpretation but they are percent related as well maybe its because im from an econ background but it would really surprise me if someone beyond rd year undergrad didnt know about that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjeUpOb25FTDFZT3g4Zk00Z0twQ3Z3aVRFYWp1azJ5SVJiU09kZzRtdFczVFoyckpLbm8zZ2hiSjF3OFJPUWxsa0RZN3d4UnhfT0J6TVEzSExvMnhQR1E9PQ==

think about self driving cars they can never learn to drive cars like humans if they are trained by just looking through lidars and cameras because driving a car requires general intelligence a large language model has a model of the world that it has learned through words but it is a model of the world no less the model clearly understands things and while some people say it is just predicting what to say next i would argue that this is also what humans do we predict what our next action should be and this prediction is expressed through voice or muscles a large language model can understand a picture because it can relate stuff that it sees in the picture through a generalized understanding of the world so a large language model would be my best bet at building a truly good self driving car it will be able to achieve human level evaluation of the obstacles it sees on the road even if what it sees is a monkey riding a bike with an old grandmother chasing it with her purse up high the main difference between llm an humans is actually in my opinion that we have access to its thought process its first though must be correct or we will consider it dumb but if the llm was able to have an internal discussion before presenting its answer to us the llm would be able to lay strategies for the discussion in an internal context and also probably be able to provide even better answers then it already does,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjWkNhWUh4NExlb1RlNFUwWm1GMmJUQ3lqd2M4VXA1OFBiVm4yN3pxeHhwNUd4WFFtRzh4ci0zak9ibnRncWRhUTlOanVPRE9GNkZ5djdESXNmSXVwU0E9PQ==

is there a reason you dont want to use a classical timeseries approach power demand is extremely well suited to classical timeseries add some exogenous regressors for your specific usecases and you should be able to produce a pretty strong baseline model without much trouble from there you could estimate offsets with the fancy model maybe you have special reasons to believe that you have information that improve on the base forecast and that isnt well utilized in the timeseries model train iteratively timeseries train through all but the next day predict next day estimate errors repeat then train the lgbm on those errors be extremely careful about accidentally leaking data its very easy to mess that up with this kind of approach realistically the timeseries approach is probably going to do just fine,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQk55NnJrY2I0YWs5Z19ZNWpXakZ2RFl0bWUzcjN5cFpObndNWjBGMEh2bXIxbml2aHRRSlNlbTZkYVJzZkZ2WWE2TkY2NlNaRzZ6RVprUU1ENkRhdnc9PQ==

scoping is this a screening tool ie callback yn is this a full candidate pipeline tool define what problem youre solving recruitment is a multistage process that used hard and soft data to arrive at a decision understanding where your solution fits in will help you without knowing this the suggestions i make are very general also get some domain knowledge on this stuff what sort of tools are used what do they say about a candidate id also check for biases by looking at genderage and seeing if they have any correlations in the existing data to any key selection criteria you may want to look into methods to limit their influence on the target this stage of the journey can also yield some insight for your firm on what they can do to start addressing biases id also want to do some rigorous feature selection to see if there is maybe too much data being collected thats redundant to simplify the model and provide insight on potentially saving money in recruitment general ideas for models would be logit regression potentially with ordinal outcomes if multistage perhaps even elastic net hope this helps this sounds like a very fun project enjoy the journey and dont get stuck on finding the perfect answer people science is part art form part science i should know im an org psych this is my wheel house also think strategically and look for insights you can generate along the way truth is your model may not work at all or simply not be worth it for them so if you can provide little nuggets along the way itll show you can bring value throughout the process rather than just a magical black box model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjanhIZWlLVDdGNFp0X2sxNG5XbXl1bEdiTkt3LUZWVlFqb0lFS2hVM2Y0WVkzcExFaVpKRjFkY1lnUjFsWEVEdzNVV24zbXd2bjJiVjFmRnJxQjV5RzJMY1FpU2NQWldCUk1tdjdHTVZzeHc9

for what if you need to write documentation for a model so that other people can repeat it of course you need to describe what you did and why if this is not required as a rule no one is interested in the details how to explain this to stakeholders people who understand something in mathematics do not ask stupid questions so we can simply say that this is how mathematics works if we go into details we can of course say that minimizing the mean square error is equivalent to the maximum likelihood principle if normally distributed errors are assumed something about the gaussmarkov conditions after that explain for a long time what the maximum likelihood principle is and so on further but who cares,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkclBvdHV4QlRuZ1lXcXBGLWEwSmNOUzJHTVZUMkV0SElGTnk5c21SMS1SZXVLdXlvRmpvbDk1Q1RudlU1bTZvZV9CbUl5TU1OdWtFX1h1YmJQb3NQR0E9PQ==

as the old saw goes engineers know how to make things work scientists know why they do this is especially true in the case of databased systems indeed now additionally engineers must know to communicate with who pays for such a system scientists with who uses it synergy between those two specialists irrefutably is key to any successful information system project note btw that science is not or not anymore just an academic pastime a good data scientist in particular displays deep formal understanding of logic databases linguistic issues semantics artificial intelligence and design methodologies in an application context specialization says the other saw is for insects,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSnRlNWVMSFdQWVI4ZVk2bTFxbmdWZ2ZtM0IxZGRyTEoxY1dZcTNfWlZubllITnROVWg2MldpVVgtUzhhMy1pYktmZnRPVzh1Vi1ReUh5a3czSC1EWVE9PQ==

the biggest issue for me is that the results should drive the narrative you ask open questions and then answer them with analyticsviz however you dont speak to the actual data and cite metricsresults in your narrative you leave the audience to interpret my suggestion would be to adjust the narrative to allow the entire analysis to stand on its own assume non technical people will review without you explaining it otherwise the visualizations look solid good viz choices etc,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkd0doSG00Y3dWOFhzeEVqWmoxZjhsbjgzUGQ3TG5mWUxXVWhYV3hUbTNoQTA3emxVZUNpZnhQcWFiT2dZUHlHSU5ya2JHMHdzUjBnbEhXQ1N6cUJRaEE9PQ==

i was kind of thinking about what casella says about bayesian reg with d exp priors there >the lasso estimate for linear regression parameters can be interpreted as a bayesian posterior mode estimate when the regression parameters have independent laplace ie doubleexponential priors a demonstration can be found here<url> im not saying it is the exact same concept though because my education in stats is not rigorous im self taught for the most part,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkRE9yR1Q1OUpuci1XaVRBWE5zTC1tVml3QVZTSURhTmo2TXhtZzdRZkFaU09FOG5raGVDaXA3VVR2SkpkLTUxdkk2S25EWTgyRGY2ZE8tY2xQRFF3MlE9PQ==

this is the actual answer the choice of model for a lot of fraud detection can be trivial unless you have highly specific use cases that especially benefit from some exotic models like elliptic envelope compared to the data inputs fraud detection which is inherently modeling a rare event where you typically dont know all of the root causes lives and dies by very meticulous feature engineering,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkRm9rLXgySGxxU1VybDBTSUQ3cWVrSjR0eXRQM3lYVFhwVjYxRGUwU0MtTVNOeFRST3ZubHRLSmItYnJFNFFCaFJvTlQ3Tko4XzRzU3lGYU9VVlgyZVE9PQ==

for classification just use lightgbm or other gradient boosted decision tree method no normalization required saves time and is basically the best youre going to get out of the box with exceptions glms are basically a relic of the past now that we have shap feature importance to cover the one downside of tree methods explainability for clustering you need normalized data just use bestnormalize or similar and feed it all your numeric data to easily achieve this without having to examine every feature,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdmRPQXdFRXE4TWx1azVsNERsOFl6QUYySktvaVRaVmRwSFRZZVZTU2pyeUY5b3NYS3JlTUtSaDg1WGZKb1B0aTdnbHVMYno3Vlp2bVU1YjhiQzJDZXc9PQ==
look into bayesian statistics this is a whole field with several methods in ml ab testing statistical inference etc for example hidden markov models which to my knowledge were used in speech recognition for quite a long time look into the field everyone is impressed by it and wants to use it no one understands it lol youll here some variation of bayesian statistics are so cool all the time a great investment of time and energy if you want to impress people and stand out but you need a good background in mathstats to get started thats probably why a lot of people dont useunderstand it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkWGUwWEUwTzhjYWZmRHZtZlNsR19ZQ3FRNldDUTlqdzZrZWhUd3YzS1hjM3VoOFp4V1RYN2NtYmY3N1E0MWthTkRzcWN2YXNlaTM2X3lZR1BpTFQzZmc9PQ==

a bit older than a lot on this subreddit so some techs may seem outdated joined the military out of high school but was injured during my first contract was planning on studying engineering but a smaller school provided a full ride scholarship between academics and partial gi bill so i ended up attending there studied economics and mathematics i had a really good advisor that highlighted the need for extra mathematics to be competitive for analyst roles and graduate school interned more on the quality controloperations side between years <number><number> and <number><number> interned as a quantitative business analyst intern my third year however due to a curriculum change i was able to graduate after my third year i applied to grad schools with a focus more on statistics as data science was starting to get its big push i lucked out with my mathematics department being heavily tied to the computer science department so i had taken some programming classes along with the mathematics theory my econometrics courses were also taught in sas which at the time was still seen as a good skill i got into my first choice grad school with hovers inside the top <number> graduate statistics programs the degree was an applied statistics program that eventually became a msds program my graduate program required a practicum so i got to tack on another internship like experience applying in the fall and spring i was able to land a role as a data scientist at a big tech company straight from grad school fall recruiting for me was a bit rough as i was still transitioning skill set to what data science was looking for at the time,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSmxLSl9TcmtNbjFlNU9RVkJVeUo0SXF1M2tBekU0ZDB1U05sWm9GS0dvMmw0X0doNkJzckhaYU1RYmd0ZEM2NXFaVVY4Rldtb3NidTQybFV6ZlFidFpaeTJ5S1RiODhpOG9QLTVhd3JPMkk9

why i need a whole new degree is because i dont have any practical knowledge regarding ds i think it will be easier for me to learn and get a job by getting a degree from turing college they claim they make you work on actual projects and stuff that matters i think ds pays best all the best guys i know end up working in ds somehow,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkQl9IbmpTVGhaZ3BNcnVVQXNmWGxVSDFzM3ZBVWoyYTVBS0ZDd1A4eHNpSUs1N3VmemFsNlRMbGdFbEdlOGM3MXE5OWpNaHlMOXZVMGVKV2RteU5wQXc9PQ==

i think if you phrase this about strategy and winning you will keep the audience engaged acronyms are necessary in all parts of business but id suggest only use the minimum to help people understand i dont think you need to change the dashboard per se but it might help to have a slide deck to anchor things tell your story on the deck then either use screen shots of the dashboard or jump over to it i think you have a lot to work with here,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkRE5lT0JpOUprNkVRc1lIU25mVVRxWnliQy1HajN3TXZlWW1HSFVJcFhDSkZ0c1dCVTdkclotR1RtS01VdEFHcklyN1BRTl9WNjRSZGgyR3huWGJPNUpwTnlxSGhXZk1uVXJZODFMYzhnY2s9

anything truly sota done under the guise of a financial institution is not going to be broadcast on a public internet forum at a high level i can tell you model tuning for fraud detection at scale will likely lead to marginal improvement odds are there is far more value to a bottom line in improving data business intelligence optimizing governance processes and improving feature engineering outside of research work i would propose prioritizing processes like the above over spending significant time trying to tune a model based just on the context provided i would recommend building a model in a framework like xgboost near the end stages of the project it should take up a far smaller portion of time compared to governance feature engineering and improving intelligence big picture at the end of the day your goal should be to have something to show nontechnical folks like finance as it relates to bottom line if you say you spent a month working on technical development to generate a <number> improvement in model accuracy its going to come across as an inefficient use of company resources think of what you want an ideal outcome of the project to be when deciding how to prioritize your time think from the perspective of nontechnical folks a perfect outcome in the future could be walking in and saying i made these governance processes <number> faster by automating the etl process over the past month this has increased our detection rate by x and decreased data error rates by validating our etl procedures or i identified the following data sources as noise and removed them from the model this led to an improvement in accuracy of and decreased our cost of resources by <cur> or i met with the department and we identified the following data sources as relevant they are now included in the model leading to higher accuracy rates sorry to go on a tangent but these are the kinds of things you should be thinking about if youd like to be considered a high achiever high impact employee at your organization this kind of mindset will get you noticed especially by nontechnical management while focusing all of your time and energy on marginally improving model performance will likely be considered an inefficient use of time,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNld6aGpia3JnX193anV6Z0JEbmhlNUQ0YWFqWmIwOE9CQjFhaUhWTFpBT09pNFU2TGh4ekhibDI1VjhDc3ZNOUFfeFlvVzIzTUpqenpyY3lvcnN6YVE9PQ==

i found this article really helpful <url> we use it for a recommendation system where we trained a model to calculate a score of how well a product matches to a given client using a masking strategy but since we have no or not enough real data yet on how well this score effectively correlates with the probability of buy of a product that is offered to a client we start with an assumption prior and update the change in evidence see the article above while we get more data,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkY3gtQUtQUXVNS2llNUtsTGVuVGwzTVlrVVFRdnFvQkI2R3V5UjFGVk91aUlfNUtrUUM1ZEpvMUNuTzJUbkxydGNRYXRuV29HT3Q2elRpc1N0WTM0Y0E9PQ==
as a general rule bayesian approaches are useful for modelling small data high value problems eg the probability of a loan default or insurance claim where these events dont happen very often but they are very costly so its important to estimate the probability accurately the second reason to use them is when you have prior knowledge that you want to incorporate into the model in the case of these two examples if you are just opening a new loan book or insurance line you might estimate the likelihood of defaultclaims using a prior distribution crowdsourced from industry experts this allows you to start doing business with no defaultclaim history and to learn as you gain experience through these events,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkaE4xendwR1hlSGRKMGlfb1lfdmtaSDR5bnhOMDlVLWtyci0zZlhaX21Ha2RRY2o0QXBZVE9FblV1SjhBbklUZnUzRHc4ajlfT0ZDd2s1Qk1nb2F3Q0NveTFCNTU5cFdWdGctMUp4MklJMEk9

in my opinion there are two issues llms are the first models with which almost all employees without any technical knowledge can interact that means from technical analysts to call centers for example a wide variety of jobs which can have an ai assistant which is really helpful indeed however on the other hand all the bosses whant to have a medal and say that they are the first ones to have immplemented ai in their company it does not matter if it is useful or not and they may even have no idea and suggest randome ideas just to get the title of first department with ai or we have an ai which,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkRnhSaUNzaVQ3TnJPRWVoeFlvTXJOcE1kdUk2XzF0bUNCZ0dyVERkYkxhN2thYXNfUVJicEFiVUMtTWFOT3dldnlLUlAtRHBXMXVqQ2ZPTlk0TDRySmc9PQ==

hey guys im a doctor in the uk and currently working <number> years post grad the pathway to becoming a doctor in the uk is an undergraduate degree mbbs after spending around <number> years in the medical field especially in this current environment im desperate to leave clinical medicine my only passion has been tech and programming however due to family pressure i ended up in medicine i currently have a couple offers for a msc in health data science my main question is trying to choose between ucl and lshtm the thesis for lshtm is a summer project which the school states the project will typically involve identifying appropriate data to tackle a particular research question extracting and cleaning the data analysing the data and creating suitable visualisations of the results students will describe the whole project in a detailed written report whereas for ucl the model for the dissertation is a journal article where an independent research project is researched and written under the supervision of a member of academic staff i feel like the former is more employable with evidence of a project and possible networking however ucl offers a bit more courses that im interested in and is a more prestigious school i appreciate any insight that you guys provide im currently learning python relearning calculus linear algebra and statistics to prepare,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeXl1MkcxYTd6MnVUc2J6cnFVckFxNXRHSzcwblJwbDNLbUU0RU9xVnA4alFjNEhmSDhqTW5PdnVsNG9UR0s0SE9SQlZOQUQ2eXkzRGxBeHNyTWU0RV9BSHYtOEY2OEE5OU5mZVVrODhTRGc9

data science analytics data engineering and business intelligence are in a weird space right now job titles are wildly misleading and theres a ton of overlap between what jobs do at different companies in different industries and even within the same companies sometimes make sure youre searching for all those job titles and looking at the job descriptions and the responsibilities to make sure youre looking at the right jobs have you reached out to a recruiter who works in the space or to any of the companies youre interested in working with directly that can be a viable longer term approach as well id work through your network through your alumni association from your masters degree what other sort of role you can take is up to you id stay away from manual labor if you can its hard on your body and doesnt leave you much energy and time to continue searching for the job you actually want,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNDZ4amwwRDdWYU0wQ0ZmTG43TEJtTm4zNmREaVU4ZXA0eDBDSUd6Q3JLUjJJN3dqTHhiSXg1QjRkdVowNkN4RENDMmQ5UnJUUHV6Z2h3aTZvaFBHdTc2c3hVTWluWXZaanhmcVpDclFNTzg9
just curious as someone who recently is unemployed what rates are you looking at are you only looking for positions with ml or have you thought about ones that might be less appealing are you only targeting remote roles i would say reach out to network thats where you can find the most opportunity and ease of getting through even if resume is bad i would recommend being open to go in office even if not preference main places hybrid are big banks with recruiters try different ones and the best is if you have any friends who are recruiters the best is if you can get someone from bigger chain in local office then they may have inside scoop on how to sell you what opportunities fit they may also have repor with hiring manager and can more likely get you on short list i do know though for instance some of the positions im looking at the range midpoint is below my salary but im still going to try and get around my old salary k but if i cant then i might jump on it i know too lots of places locally like to do contract then open to converting to full time on those rates im looking at is a bit lower at like <number> an hr also lots of these posts are fake if you see a bunch of same spot they most likely just collecting resumes still might be worth it but also might take forever before they actually hiring for the role,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkcmR4NzNxWUh1WFdZaDBiaWl5RFYtWVhJVkgzTmc3aV83b1dxTlBLdTZmTE9CeWZQbjloSjFES2JTdEN0a1RTeVZkUEs2MzQ5NEY1dEFuZkdHdXNGM2c9PQ==

bad the best roles would be actuarial if not analyst ds or ml but they require exams you most likely dont have id focus on cost cutting now to extend the runway you have lower your burn rate to last longer better id also look at startups look at venture capital companies and look at their portfolio and apply to any job use a ocr template use a lot of the lingo of each job description in some of your bullet points solid advice regardless dont be complacent thinking your resume is good it sounds like you got pushed past the ocr with your friend and maybe the gov didnt even use one but a default fillineverything application make a google doc basic bullet point resume chat gpt can make one of your current resume bonus dont use latex or another typesetting language those are not great anymore imo,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZ3R1S3oyM2dWSUtuand2NkFwQkhsYnZYWjk4eldJVncxaEtDTWYwb3ZUM0xkQndwZXg1U1FuNW9JVmZWdzBEUzh4Ul9HMGJVQUNselhJQnpwbVpIWlE9PQ==

youre presenting this if so all of those words should be things you say and not things written in the dashboard i previously was in a role that was similar to what you describe and some key rules are a if you have to write a paragraph to describe what is being shown the visualization is not good and b never put a bunch of text and instead explain it to your audience visualizations are an aid for you to tell a story the story should not be on the slide and this type of text should never be in a dashboard my own preference would be to also divide the information up either in a slide deck or across different sheets eta and just for knowledge the main use case for dashboards is to view metricstrends that might change over time with data that automatically updated as such the story you tell today might be different from the story you tell two weeks from now thats another reason why seeing so much text is just a bit confusing to me as someone who was in corporate doing a role like what you described,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYmV3ZF9jVDVDR3UwUl92YnFIdkpRWFpyQ3pFMDlmODJ1bG1iUnltYmxub193M3BQanRzTVNneHJuRVphTW9uVmV3eGJQMXJTWl83WEVrR0NLY0UyaDBndUpWeU1oQy1sMEhzS0xjUnFSbms9

you should look into the services that scan your resume for keywords and compare it to job postings one thing i learned is that the single biggest barrier to getting a job you apply for is hrrecruiting people that dont know anything about the role using software to filter out hundreds of resumes i had a service help me redo my resume and the way they did it felt awful and made me cringe but i started getting at least <number> or maybe <number> times as many responses as i was getting before that like i think the game is just changed and you basically have to do a sort of seo on your resume or its not even worth applying edit additionally ive found applications are mostly meaningless with all the job post finding services because every post will have <number> applicants in like <number> days that and all the fake job posts that are just for companies to put together lists of talent for their recruiters or to pretend theyre hiring so they dont spook investors i had better luck looking at a job posting then directly messaging a technical recruiter from that company on linkedin and attaching my resume probably <number>x the success but also <number>x the time investment per job,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkMl8zc3RlU1NpdVhYWWtpemlyWUlqRUR1enFXMk0zTHZfMlFEMDlRVDhwNFFwNXYxeVhIV3dqeVIwZk1zV0lVeDZ2M09jTXlFOVRZUnlLeTU4VG1kTEE9PQ==

it honestly is less about what degree and about what problems you solve with project work or research experience all of my opportunities are based on the research and projects ive done look into research experience for undergraduates research programs of work with faculty and project focused classes some credentials may turn out to be valuable like the actuarial soa cas exams but theyre nontransferable things but do give you good knowledge if i could go back and this is a comment you see all the time on this sub id stick with computer science major and maybe some stats or math minor or secondary emphasis there are just more opportunities there most of the bs i do isnt interesting or is like using <number> of the knowledge ive ever gained the jobs that use more are more senior or significantly harder to get,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkT2laa1ZwOU5selp6Skd4ekxNeUpleWNGUkcweTM1VEg3NV9QMkUwazVPdWRxWmwzTEp3YzBZd05kRk9TVXJ2UWF3NTdPZHNtLWpJeXYwRS1VQjdSRmc9PQ==
>easier to get a job when you already have one you have so badly misinterpreted this  you can be opentowork while still having a job so the point is moot to begin with its easier because you can take your time looking and you have more leverage in negotiating it has nothing to do with more opportunities coming your way complete opposite you do not have a job,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbXhYWjNVY0hiN0JHLUtXX1R4MEYzc0kyVGVIWVNsRklWQVgwaVNpZXJza3l3RFJwLVpEU1FESXVHUngzMS1MUURNYnVyWWRZSFJxazhhRGFhMGxCZGluZE9jejdMMERhSDJzZTd1dTVBUjA9

its definitely tough out there in the job market right now especially for data analyst and data scientist positions given your strong background with an ms in stats and <number> years of experience it might be a good time to upskill and make yourself even more competitive in the field while youre waiting for the market to recover consider diving into ai and advanced data analysis ironhacks ai school offers courses that could give you an edge these courses are designed to simplify complex data analysis with ai which is a highly soughtafter skill by enhancing your skill set with ai knowledge you might find more opportunities opening up in both data analysis and data science roles check out ironhacks ai courses to see how they can help you boost your career make complex data analysis simple with ai<url> in the meantime while youre learning and upgrading your skills you could explore shortterm roles that are somewhat related to your field or those that leverage your analytical skills in different ways it help desk roles for example might not be your ultimate goal but they can keep you in the tech field and possibly lead to better opportunities later on stay strong and keep pushing forward the market will eventually turn around and youll be even better positioned to land a great role with your new skills,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYmtCY0RvM0JuNXQ2aGFMbGNoUVZmMkxkNFRwRDZHVVlpeUpGWkhqLWlacTBMWjZMdHQtWExZR0hzaTBLbGp4MU9JcjJtNzlGM1E3OU0yZjd2dVJLU1E9PQ==

personally i never paid too much attention to certifications other than university degrees they might be a minor plus but most of the times i did not care too much in comparison work experience mattered a lot ie what sort of projects youve done and then of course the interview itself a mix of technical skills and your personality i would not remove the certifications entirely unless your cv is way too long but if the list is too long just keep the three most relevant and current ones,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlOElaWDhDOGNkWmdfMlkzR2I5RmhqZk1zYmhMakQzUkE4YlUweFVvc3ZTTk54YXh6TGNyc1JqX3dTdGVLYTlvNDkzTjdMTHJxWlRndHIxUWpZV0pqSVE9PQ==
do you think certifications are good from an hr pov within your company mainly like hey look i keep my skills up to date andor i try to learn new stuff that shows a certain motivation i personally do some of them soft or hard skills for that purpose to have a bit of leverage even if that is not a tremendous asset,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleWM5dTY1bmE2QXE4WTRBSXJzbzVvVFBaTG1DRndocWRsYlZ3QWNOSlcyWGpKQ2c5WVA2bHNlSEl5eDFqS2stQ01uWHU5aFZXOUtqWEhqWjRzMGRYOEE9PQ==

that depends on the company culture certifications can be good for your career plan to satisfy internal hr development plans that is also as a manager they can be a good means to send all of your team members to a training to justify building up a new skill within the entire team theres some pressure then for everyone to really do the training beyond that i dont think managers or hr are very much interested in your certifications to be honest but it also depends a bit on your age seniority field etc if you are very young and fresh from university having a certificate could show you are keen to learn something new its a small plus but not a huge one also if you attempt to enter a new field then yes i would suggest you do some certifications there to show youre being serious but the more senior you are the less relevant certifications become in my view its more a way for you yourself to keep uptodate with learning new technologies,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldzZJZ19aQndCQUNFY1RHUUx0TkpGUUZQQmppVDVkcUFyWkpuSm9LZE5qUUFLeEZmelJ4b2MxSmpsMFZPSjFfbHpsRUozM3NoRWxtOFc5U1hwYnk4VkE9PQ==

i dont if you havent applied it at work then i dont care about it and if you have applied it at work i dont care if you have a certification or not it probably holds a bit more value for very junior candidates but even then im going to care about any work experience + school a whole lot more than random certifications,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSXcwQ0RfNDluelVFcmctUnE3ZE5mNHZtRW5XOFB0dVpiNFltNks2aGdUZ0RtekFWWTRqSWk3Y19IdElNTXhDM3FRdElMd1YtbGY4dnE3Z0hCaEVobHc9PQ==

short answer is yes neither hiring managers nor recruiters necessarily care about certifications they care about skillsexperience in the end it comes down to whether or not you check their boxes if they ideally want someone with some amount of gcp experience then a gcp certification allows you to add it as one of your skills for entrylevel positions it can make a big difference,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlenVDelU2TEl1cVgzc1ZkMzcwejJDWGc2N0lzdm80cF8wRXh0ajR1UlRVQ0l5SlRQaE9kS3ljbHJyUGg4bU8wQjVmakFETWp0V2ZIalNsZk1lTDRTSWc9PQ==

you really need to tap into your network with a job market like this if not nows a good chance to try to rebuild your network for next time you are job hunting i dont have great advice on how to do this other than catching up with old coworkers managers alumni from your college programs that work at companies you are interested in i dont know the city you live in but you can probably find something tangentially related to what you want to do thru a contract agency with that much experience consulting agencies esp smaller boutique ones historically could be a good bail out option but im guessing those companies arent in a great spot rn overall just try to tap into your network try to make friends with a recruiter in a staffing agency and get their advice on the job market and your resume in general separate from that keep applying its a numbers game and youll find something eventually assuming you are qualified,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlaHlJSEh5eHJ5RXU3RDByTFo1ZmlVeUp2S3kydDJYVy1ITHhMbWJIMndyY1lRZ1dZVXBQakdqd05YclkxaFhVcHh4TXdpTUxmUzdZckhtVm8yVkV4SFpuSk9UUkNFR3l1ZDhMVHN2Y2hSNnM9

not really tbh i would mainly pay attention to it for a junior fresh from university but even there it would be more about their motivation than the actual certificate the issue is there are tons of certificates and it would cost me days to evaluate if that specific certificate is valuable or just a meaningless pdf from some basic tutorial that you can learn in about <number> hour some certificates are just trash while others are actually valuable so in the end i assume that a student with a lot of certificates was motivated but someone who has years of experience probably had too much spare time in their last job or they are already outdated in a rapidly moving field in the end actilual projects at previous companies or public projects on github have far more value i believe,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMFFXcHhja29SUEVLZnhMT2RqREVTaFNCWVlOZnVTMDB3eHp3cTJlZV9GdkhrRy00eWMyQ2g3YkpmUDN5NVJsdVdITjJOYlhsNm1nYUwyR1dZVXhSMnc9PQ==

i keep bringing this up because im now old enough to have lived through several of these the issue with new technologies is that you always get to a stage where a technical person says this could revolutionze some things and a marketingsalesproduct person translates that into this will revolutionize everything big data in the early s some companies and researchers showed up to the table with specific applications where the ability to harness granular data at scale via the combination of parallell architectures and parallellizable methods made a huge difference over the status quo aggregation of data classical methods heres something i hadnt quite processed the big data revolution that got hyped in <number> and had died by <number> were living in it now all of those things that were promised to be a huge deal we take it for granted now but being able to spin up a kubernetes cluster to run inference on whatever you want as fast as you want it thats it thats what big data was supposed to be and heres the thing it didnt revolutionize everything but it did revolutionize some things the same is true with llms right now the issue is that nontechnical people are very impressed by what it can do and as a result all of the people who are selling llm based solutions are feeding into that every genai startup is crowing about all the things that llm can do and sometimes lying about it which leads executives to believe that llms because they sound like a person can do everything this has actually more and more become one of my big pet peeves with executives as of recently its become extremely obvious to me that a lot of them take on the attitude of my job is to have cool ideas your job is to make it happen which is fine and dandy when youre talking about things that just require work it is not ok when youre talking about things that require research and thats whats happening with llms llms are great for some things like beyond incredible for some applications and smart companies with educated executives know to triple down on using llms for the things theyre good at dumb companies with noneducated executives are trying to solve every problem with llms and thats where the hype is the perspective from some executives that because they think it sounds good that it will work and make themsave them a ton of money,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbElRQnc3LUNvZ1dPOGJoV3ctbmpsNng5OWdEQ2t5aEVHai1fS0lJZ1otLUF0bW9zV0hzX0pFWjdYbGhPZE1YV1d1S1JnaTRFWUFZMVVBa3BHZjkzNWc9PQ==

>data scientists dont really seem to be scientists i agree with this and even the people that are doing research in data science are not often doing actual science research as muchs theyre doing engineering research source am traditional engineering phd data scientists are business employees not academics and everything else in your post seems to be missing that >everyone on this sub downplays the importance of math and rigorous coursework as do recruiters people downplay the importance of math and rigorous coursework past a certain point that is if you want to focus on getting the most out your career any career then theres a balance of skillsets that you need to bring to the table the reason we emphasize this a lot in data science is because there are a ton of people with strong technical skills and comparably very few people with strong everything else skills its not that were saying hey dont even bother with learning statistics what were saying is that most people reach a point of technical skillset where the incremental value on becoming technical stronger has a lower roi than becoming stronger everywhere else and thats partly because it becomes so much harder to keep becoming more technical and partly because its sooooo much easier to just learn the bare minimum of soft skills to become wellrounded enough that doesnt mean that there is no value in becoming more technical many people do its just that the share of people for whom that equation is roi positive is much smaller its basically limited to the people who are both technically brilliant and also beyond limited in their soft skills which again especially with the incidence of neurodivergence in stem fields is not that rare but its going to be a smaller share of professionals as to what recruitershiring managers are looking for we want people who can both do the necessary technical work while also functioning in a work environment that is comprised of and led by people which means you need to knowlearn how to deal with people productively thats pretty much it >and the only thing that matters is work experience if you took a lot of rigorous classes and did a lot of great research and you cant translate that into workplace productivity then yeah youre not a good candidate this is like a rb running a <number> at the combine and then averaging <number> yards in the nfl i dont care what you did in a lab i care what you do in the job that im hiring you to do again data scientists are business employees not scientists >i do wonder when datascience will be completely inundated with mbas then who have soft skills in spades and can probably learn the basic technical skills on their own anyway again you are mistaking limited value beyond a baseline with zero value i forgot more math in one summer than an mba grad will have known in their entire lives and im not an extremely technical person these days i have worked with a bunch of mba grads in my <number> years in industry some of them are extremely smart but as it related to technical skills not only are they well below the baseline expectation youd have of a data scientists they also have next to none of the building blocks youd need to learn this stuff on your own i learn most machine learning on my own after graduating with a phd in or and thats because i had learned more statistics than i care to remember + optimization + discrete math + linear algebra the average mba grad will be lucky to have learned linear regression at a surface level literally draw a line through these dots level shit they dont know matrices if they learned calculus ever they forgot all about it by now the general concept of programming is completely foreign to them again i would imagine generally speaking a freshman in engineeringnatural sciencesmathcomputer scienceetc would all already know more about the technical prereqs a data scientist would be expected to have than the average mba grad and im not talking about the technical prereqs that you see on paper im talking about the prereqs that youd need to have to actually do the average day to day job of a data scientist,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRXpWWmZkdEtoeWp3Y3lRZk42ZG1ZMHVJTm1kUWhWdXh0alllNnFDQjZ4TDhCQ3NtTnMxcHZVdFF3UHRmbEhTbUFnOWR0ZW45R3BQQVp6Vml1cGJaeGc9PQ==

its not that people cant translate rigorous classes into workplace productivity indeed some of the most selective firms in finance select exactly for that and do pretty well for themselves its more that people with those rigorous classes are being dismissed by ds recruiters because they are not experienced yet this happens unfortunately to people who thought they were gonna enter academia but changed their mind and so couldnt do an internship in time if i were a recruiter for a large ds team id happily give someone with as in measure theory and functional analysis from a good school an initial screen at the very least because i know how sharp such kids are and their general problem solving skills are usually top notch everything else can be learned on the job conditional on passing technical interviews small teams are a different matter there you need tons of real experience because lots of responsibilities fall on a single individual including business oriented needs and so theres no substitute for experience there at large orgs there should be entry level roles for smart people thats how you get good seniors later down the line,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSWo5WjlZRG80QnljUndkelMtNEw5VUhlWklxVVpsMVJJRjFaMTN3b0F2U21DVWNVcGFCV3NWVG5SdXEyM2p3aGlsNlUwbExZbDFYSUlYWGo1R1h3MnY2My1TYS1wWmhPQUNwVlR5MmRNV0U9

it really depends on the organisation the hiring manager and where you are in your career in my experience certificates are largely uncorrelated with competency certifications indicate that you can pass exams but exams are completely different from building things in the real world moreover many of the popular certificates aws microsoft etc are primarily intended to sell the companys products and tie you into their ecosystem not to actually teach you any meaningful skills for that reason for anything past junior engineers i personally see them as a yellow flag they dont add anything to the resume and if the resume leans strongly on certificates then this gives the suggestion that the candidates actual skills dont speak for themselves i dont care what youve learned i only care about what youve done with your knowledge for junior engineers the situation is a bit different though juniors arent expected to have much practical experience at all yet and then the theoretical experience of a certificate could be a minor plus likewise if youre aiming to transition to a slightly different role eg swe to de then certificates in the new area could also compensate for your lack of experience in the area but opinions on this differ anecdotally ive found that atier companies and companies with a strong technology culture value certificates less than btier companies or companies where technology comes second thinking being that atier companies tend to focus on hiring engineers with a high level of competency no correlation with certification whereas consultancybtiernontech companies tend to focus on hiring a workforce with standardized skill sets which certificates do demonstrate so i would tailor your resume for the job include if its explicitly mentioned in the job ad youre on the junior end of the spectrum youre applying for a job where you have not much relevant realworld experience but you do have relevant certificates you have space left on your resume the company appears to value certificates eg look at what existing employees have on their linkedin exclude if theyre not relevant to the position youre applying for including them would distract from stronger signals of competency or would even require you to remove relevant experience imo resumes should be <number> page max including certificates almost certainly require you to drop something else the company appears to not value certificates much at all youre senior+,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNVdHZlZaeG1pSWwyUUZsbHN3RElZSVBjU2hRd0VST3dvcjV3bnpHVHVSUWJzZUY2YnlwZUJuMlg3enhVRmxUZ1l3d3FhUnZ1SUtfczRocldzSzM4eXc9PQ==

i would be more inclined to pick a thing that you want to do then get chatgpt to help you do it adding new tools and techniques as needed but yes start with python for example the project might be to pick a dataset that you want to create a visualisation from maybe host your visualisation online and make it interactive chatgpt will help you do that suggest libraries and code snippets and youll build something in no time lots of the things youve listed here will get used lots wont and my top current tip is to learn streamlit good luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJld3JQQ0hLTEN3aDI1VFBPWnJod1hDdDZ0RU8tVjR0YnJiOFBpV051MWJrekRYaEh0ZnpwY25pY2xqYWRDR2U3OWNFNzhJLVJQbHJQLUVBdV9nQWZsTGxtQXd6dV9JLThxd1drRHM0ZEYxWDg9
on a different note its not like academics are completely dysfunctional automatons that lack communication skills just because they havent worked in corporate every time you present a paper the degree to which you can convince anyone else to care depends to a great extent on your communication skills that is unless you have resolved a major unsolved problem or something of that ilk,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlN3NEVXRJWUNycGhrNTRaYThCQWUweU40OUlQTWsyOFg2U3R5MDZ2a3M2S2pjby11UF8zV1pNSjMzUk80QnowRFF4TF9MU3c5NFdqME1BY1k3ZWxvZXdiREMtZC1rMzN4ZmxnYVQ4aUtSNW89

i was for sure lucky so i wouldnt say what worked for me is all that helpful but heres the info only a bachelors in cognitive science specializing in machine learning and neural computation anyone with a ds or cs major would be much better off but i could at least talk about some less common things i had to do a lot of personal learning to keep up with competitive skills thoughextra stats through islr which now has a python version extra programming sql docker so hopefully that isnt the case for you no internships since i was working multiple restaurant jobs all summer in a beach city to pay for school was in the data science club at school but i dont think that added anything personal project site through github that had project to determine an all nba award prediction with explanations of choices project detecting the side of the body moved based on premotor brain activity and mapping it onto a d brain map da projects using excel pandas and sql to do transformations and connecting them to tableau for a dashboard as well as a superset dashboard use of docker just enough to show a basic understanding if i could go back and add anything at this point it would probably be some use of cloud probably between aws or azure depending on what you see on job postings most but doesnt matter that much i work for government contracts and pretty much all of my work has been in government cloud tenants and i had <number> experience before getting hired also anything llm i assume is hot right now so maybe get a version of llama working locally and use langchain to make custom embeddings for private documents and query them so you have something to show or even easier is to just use openai api and come up with something interesting to do with it if you want ml ops stuff specifically and can use databricksmlflow for free then that would be helpful i imagine,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQVphclZjMURWMlVtREJVcC1aRXJkbWpmSlVRd3FjTFR4OWZFeUhIVjJaV0J0ak5pVzNNbVRmcFZrRnUzYWFfc1hoTjZGQzUyMG1TQUhEc1lLb2FTRlE9PQ==

i highly recommend approaching the question in a different way think of a cool thing you would like to do not what tools you want to learn then get chatgpt help you to do it you do need a starting point and im biased and would pick python but mainly because it opens more doors than any other language so get set up with a python environment chatgpt can even help you do that then just start if you pick soimething you care about you will be motivated and learn much more quickly every time you get stuck ask chatgpt to help you out its insanely good at this tbh i would never use inline courses again chatgpt has basically taken them all and can supply the relevant bits on demand,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUy1XWm1UTlFqZEFMWUxib2hnUDRNTWF3LVU4LXpwQW1wRUxHczJURllrSkJmeHFLcWV6UG91dzJNTG9RVW5ISE9NNVJGZnNlX1FZd1I3dnBNUW5ORXdqLVFCY0NQRnUxcEd4bDAzN3MyMzg9

it depends on the level of experience and the specific certification my company uses databricks if were filling a junior entry level permission a databricks data engineer or advanced data engineer certification definitely increases your chances for consideration the same is also true of more experienced people switching technologies ie your resume shows a lot of teradata experience but youre applying for a snowflake role but for candidates with significant relevant experience applying to senior roles the certifications only really count if they are the only difference between our top two picks which is rarely the case that said i do expect my team to obtainrenew at least one cert per year to ensure they are staying current on technologies and dont lack functionality awareness because we dont use feature x already,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNGxodHBXNVJGRlB1cGd0X0cxYlRyWkpfRW9JeEJyZzFzcGhnWS1GbGhoYVlnZ3RWc2ZZN0xHUEdSVXZqYWxPY3lKV3ZEbndoaEZYZDZZQlY1Z0xUWFE9PQ==

in my experience for a junior resource it helps to some extent also certifications from a cloud platform perspective aws azure or databricks would be better and will be a plus especially if you are in consulting since some clients expect the resources to come in with the right expertise however for senior roles what matters more is always what work have you done for organisations in the past,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlb0FQUElRZldBOGxmT05JQlF1TjBta3BrazRieFI4ZmZyU2ktTUdYbmg0Y0E2VERBZGZKWWd5MFozSUVfYmoya2tkTmhMV05Ua1VBNHZhN1lQeUQyaXc9PQ==

>its not that people cant translate rigorous classes into workplace productivity indeed some of the most selective firms in finance select exactly for that and do pretty well for themselves what works for finance doesnt work for every company so yes there are absolutely industries where pure academic rigor translates great into business result fraud detection high frequency trading large scale product analytics really anywhere where you have engines running and where an improvement in the accuracy of a model results in immediate financial improvements you will see a lot of value from academically rigorous people the problem is that most companies arent like that most companies have many layers of necessary peopledriven processes and in those companies you need more than just technical skills to deliver results >its more that people with those rigorous classes are being dismissed by ds recruiters because they are not experienced yet this happens unfortunately to people who thought they were gonna enter academia but changed their mind and so couldnt do an internship in time there are two reasons for this <number> someone who has already shown they can do the job is always going to be preferrable to someone who hasnt <number> a lot of very academically capable people struggly mightily in corporate america its just a different world with very different constraints and challenges and ive seen a lot of people who thrived in academic environments not be able to adapt >if i were a recruiter for a large ds team id happily give someone with as in measure theory and functional analysis from a good school an initial screen at the very least because i know how sharp such kids are and their general problem solving skills are usually top notch everything else can be learned on the job so as someone who also got a phd and struggled to get his first job and who was really frustrated about it because of the same reasons youre highlighting i immediately understood it upon entering the workforce most teams that are hiring data scientists today are not large teams they are relatively small teams that are trying to get off the ground and because of that they dont have time to train talent you say everything else can be learned on the job but that ignores two things <number> you need someone to spend time doing the teaching <number> it takes time to learn time that person is not being productive if i am a director of ds at a company with <number> data scientists who already has <number> projects that not getting worked on i cant hire a fresh grad i already dont have the time to spare to train someone with no work experience i also cant afford to wait <number><number><number> months until this person is ready to start contributing i also cant afford the risk to hire someone who ends up hating corporate life and becomes a negative force in the team which yes happens very often now for larger ds teams teams who have a range of experiences in them and who depend on constantly building a talent pipeline in order to feed their recruiting needs that is where youll see hiring managers being more willing even prefer to hire fresh grads because theyre much more likely to be able to absorb the lack of productivity and because taking big swings at really smart people is much more valuable that is why i think youll likely see the best ds companies in the world being much more active in hiring fresh grads,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQzJKTnprZ0JlX1JYWk5zUzVZMWpoeTUyZzN5T3FEQ2Z5ai1xRmZCTHpCOUJjcEluZjFCTklackZIbE1ubTJDT0lRZnl5TTl1M213RjRJMzl3bDdaZHc9PQ==
personally i feel like sharing projects that youve done at work are more helpful in an interview context thats because while the task is related to drawing insights you might naturally get questions like how did you communicate these insights was there resistance from certain stakeholders and how did you manage that you want to have the interviewer believe that youd be a natural fit at the job and that youve possibly worked on similar problems that the company does if you do stick to the current project i would structure in a way where the problem is stated more clearly and the solution is broken down into sub components like stated in this article here<url> ie the pyramid principle if i had to take a crack at it it would be problem how do i improve my win rate problem <number> openings > solution problem <number> midgame > solution problem <number> endgame > solution i think this would help you craft a more coherent narrative and show that you can break down large questions into smaller solvable problems relatedly i would also cut anything thats unimportant to your narrative like the home countries of your opponents sharing insights effectively is often about being focussed on the most important aspects of your problem good luck and thank you for sharing,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleU9nQXVTekc2Uk5FWm1DMFVzWUNuSUM5RDNoMEZMdFVqOEt1VFVOd3VQRXRCTk1HbXRSWF96ZzVac2FmUklkN3lLN1EzeXdNVG5iRUxIdmVLS2VDNjBiQnhTQ2RoMDFwZlBSMy1ZbUlMQjg9

yeah most of my work is with dataframes so even having to export to excel wastes me too much time vscode has a viewer but you need it to be a variable and only then does it give you the filters and pagination but then you have to click it and it opens in a separate tab too many extra steps pycharm just shows all that in the jupyter cell output which is day and night better were you considering any alternatives other than vscode cant use most of the cloud tools but if theres something thats great i can probably ask my workplace to license something,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRFY2RHVqajc0bjlaUXZfU0tmYWs3MUNUci10eDJ3N3Rzb19VY3BBNnEtLVk2ZzE3b3dqdWxvVU12WkhDNzNpRFZ2TERQVWg3UWpjTWtseEE4OHNBcGc9PQ==

there have been a ton of reddit threads about this but its all anecdotal evidence no studies have been done to my knowledge with any statistical rigor it does appear that being unemployed does hurt your chances but its confounded with a ton of other factors namely in a market like the one were in now its harder to get a job and more people are unemployed but that doesnt mean being unemployed causes it to be harder to get a job i am currently unemployed and my approach has been to be honest about it on my resume and cover letter and explain that it wasnt my fault however i havent put open to work on my linkedin yet and im not sure i want to advertise that fact to the wider world right now in terms of your situation i think you should weight the risk of outsourcing vs the pay cut youd have to take say you have a <number> chance of being outsourced then take no more than a <number> pay cut or something like that i will tell you that getting a new job can take a while and becoming unemployed and needing a new job but having to wait sucks if you think youre at risk i would double down with the search best of luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRGhtclo4VEhmNWwtbTB3SXphUS1OZF8wazM4ZWxDT3RRR3NkdktlTVRMZkExVlE4OU1kZHo2U0REYTg0NW1vTDJmbFN1cHVMclZJc1M3MG1SalBtWVE9PQ==

i was a very strong communicator by engineering phd standards and i had a ton of learning to do in order to get acclimated to the corporate world what youre missing in this line of thinking is that all communication is equal academics are very strong at one specific type of communication one that prioritizes precision and correctness in very complex environments and the reason is that the primary audience of academic communications are other academics and largely ones in your same field of study whether its journal articles conference presentations etc you are spea the corporate world values a completely different type of communication once which focuses on simplicity and intuitiveness,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUEhNZTJBc2NHaUgwY0lsQXpLZGRpYzV6Q2owSVBzY1dya0VTSlROQ3gtLWVDNWI1ZTVFUzRfZGVhYXd3eC15S1MzV3VuM0MwVWJOQXY3SXE0NXRkNWc9PQ==

> for that reason for anything past junior engineers i personally see them as a yellow flag they dont add anything to the resume and if the resume leans strongly on certificates then this gives the suggestion that the candidates actual skills dont speak for themselves how do you reliably determine actual skills just from a resume maybe its just my experience but the quoted part really sounds like a baseless assumption andor personal bias hms shouldnt judge like that lots of people are achievementdriven they like to collect accomplishments if a candidate likes to learn has lots of things to show off proudly this should not be punished because of an assumption that its some hidden signal of incompetency you invite them for an interview and verify how on paper aligns with factual experience,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlU3BVTWdxTXR0SkV2WUU1T3oyd1VRbGRSdU9uLTFfUGV5c2dicHViSEhhcWJXVGh6dnM3TkVhTU9PaUhPSU1aT09XYXdsbUhnZDBpdmFwZmhsR2Q5VEE9PQ==

yeah ultimately ds isnt only doing some scrappy scripting with r and producing data viz a lot of ds out there is more akin to experimenting subsequently building ml building ml requires proper programming programming well requires at least a basic underlying understanding of dsa a ds is never gonna have to handwrite a btree implementation but youll want to understand things like bigo memoisation iterativerecursive patterns eg head vs tail recursion mutability and basic graph theory basic computer science concepts we are all doing computer science stats afterall,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUmVPa01TUFQ5OXd2ZGRnU1RjV1JteVVxbWZ0MjBRXzVGOEVCN3EzMjU0WUMxN1hkcXFVR3Nyd3VKY2cxcHIwc2FiOEQ1VDQtZ0FkdGhMUFFrUGhuRVE9PQ==

<number> agreed for the reasons you state a beginner might whip out sklearn but youll eventually need to implement some papers findings yourself or apply math yourself <number> however its not exclusive many ds folks need to get close to the metal usually if dealing with deep learning writing in rust jax or even going into handwriting cuda kernels for optimizing model inference admittedly those folks tend to be specialised as ml engineers but ds is a whooole spectrum and in smaller orgs it wouldnt be unusual for that type of ds to be close to metal around the time m macbooks were taking off i had to do a bit of oslevel closer to the metal work than i was used to tackling esoteric virtualisation issues,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbjJFNnU1TnZIZk5qXzdJOWxJODJDSC1ULS1mNGMzTDVZQVFCVEVwVk5ORlh0aGNJeXZGWWR5ZEJJYTNNVXlGU3F3UGNGbTlpVVBMQV9fZkVnVDlVcFE9PQ==

one of the crazy positives of this time right now is that something like <number> percent of us workers have experienced a period of unemployment at least once it has thus become more normal and is far less stigmatized than in the past there is a strong likelihood that at least some of the folks interviewing have themselves experienced unemployment and bring that perspective to the interview that said it is a truism that it is better to be working while interviewing as that gives you an extra sort of leverage in when to leave what to apply for what to accept and yet in my case early on it was sudden unemployment that forced me to take charge of my destiny and i followed a very different career path as a result,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldURHNkpVaGNweGhhSEVoY1VxWGJfTng4NFFRWFB1OFZfREstS0lzZmdtQ3VrTnA1MDFmYm56dXpMbkp4MEpWblA4NjNOaUNWVHk5Ymh5TkI0SG1ZSGc9PQ==

theres trade offs for doing this its not all upside if you know the math well and specialize in it you can be a decent ds for all companies knowing the base info however the downside is when this knowledge isnt particularly useful or special in the age of abstracting away since youre using the same methods you just know a bit more about them the end result is the same think about computers who is hiring assembly or binary developers you will thrive in famine situations when companies lack resources and have to build their own or if someone is building a brand new product that needs to go from the lowest level and requires special nuances these situations are not uncommon of course but this is where you will have an edge over normal people however i feel like the math is not where dss should specialize rather you should specialize in a domain of another field you have an advantage in the industry over people who studied the math more closelyassumed finite time where you have to choose one or the other with the intuition to even take on the product management or business analyst aspects of the job you know what to look for and as people who studied bayesian we all know choice of priors is important companies also love it when they dont have to hire extra people to do parts of the job so youre not completely screwed in the famine section either your only issue is if your sector goes out of date but as long as you pick a longstanding stable sector and are willing to learn the specifics closely you will land on your feet i mean look at what the smart people are doing theyre hiring people who already know their industry looking for that specific industry experience close to the math seems a bit too generalist for a strong ds who provides tons of business value seems more suited for a researcher ds or mle,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZnQ2VmRDNnNlaE1LUGdORll4N3hueTBkRnV3MG4zV3NBRFY0cHdjUzFsbWJ4c3hobTU5Y3dNdFdPZS1GTlp4d3V4YnJjY2xWR0E3S0phQ2JMeXM4QWc9PQ==

the way i usually talk about the distinction is empirical versus from first principles i would say a from first principles approach would be like if you fit a certain model that should be correct or at least eg an engineeer or other sme tells you should describe the data wheras an empirical approach is more whatever works personally i prefer to stick to a firstprinciples model if i have a starting point but thats probably my bias as a trained physicist working in still a very engineeringphysicsy domain where you can realistically predict that the thing you want to model depends on certain things in certain ways or with certain symmetries eg knowing a certain effect probably looks like an exponential with unknown time constant,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlY2Q4d3hGYWZFSFp3VTh6eVIzYTU3Q3d2NTJYUlV4T29mdHRQOXlCMHp1eGNxNmtyUG55LWFBamFfWjRSclB2NThST2VPalc4YXhPU3l2WGZfLVc0N2c9PQ==

yeah it depends on career stage a lot someone who is applying to be a junior has a couple of certificates and has done even a minimal amount of work that uses them is going to be a very strong candidate someone who is applying to be a senior who is listing a lot of certificates on their cv instead of experience is likely a weak candidate if someone has a certificate and has applied it at work that probably bumps them up over someone who has done a similar task but who doesnt have a certificate only marginally though ive found personally that its a bit of a red flag when people have too many certificates theres a level where it looks like all you do is collect certificates and not actually do any work,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRS0tUHd2bmJfYUxacUZudFk3OGV3LVl3VFMtS2lxckRsLWlIMU5BVjRFNkpJX1ZBUmN3M28yM2xXOTlWOHh5ZUxoOHVMT3MtaFZGUXlFSldjdFhVQ3lrZnJKc0Q3dkNGUTVxcE4zS19SOVU9

i think youre making a fair comparison between ds and engineers the implication is probably the same too the amount of deep knowledge you need depends heavily on the jobcompany for most places bringing in business values is more important than possessing deep technical knowledge that means the engineers would need to be great at designing software systems and collaboration not being a kernel guru the data scientists would need to be great at designing experiments decision making and strategic thinking not knowing how to implement xgboost from scratch of course having the knowledge is an advantage but its not the goal and im generalizing here some companiesjobs do indeed deal with the low level stuff but id wager theyre not the majority,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTGJHNzhSWGVveTFWbWs1b0ZaM0hSb1BCTHVOMTdFRUcwVEh2ZnVkT096WUwyUWJpOEhoaTg3d1NSNFhGcXFyaHJSMVVxZG9RLVdpd0Rxc0xJektHNWc9PQ==

i think it really depends on the level of the position and the quality of the certification if you are a junior engineer most certifications are marginally useful for a senior engineer a high quality certification like a aws or databricks certification might be a small plus however if they add a low quality certification like coursera then i wonder if they are as senior as they claim,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZVNVTzJWOU5paUNlY1I2Q1oxNzA4bWdPMkFQY2toaFZSSFJITVNuWmYzRTd4SVZrSmJ1NnlXZFJBckVmYW5BTDFXMXpOTU4wM2VRY3FSWmFxWVZDaGc9PQ==

disclaimer i am not nor have i ever been a hiring manager from what i understand the only ones that might carry weight are the certifications that are administered by amazon google and microsoft or the cloud certifications by the specific companies who created the platforms eg snowflake databricks which specific certifications beyond that depend on what exactly you want to do they certainly dont matter more than work experience though and are probably most beneficial at the entrylower levels,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZTZ3em9pMXFjSFFUVWp1bzYzVE1zalRlOC1ITEc0VG1zbHRZU3FmX0RDd3FQTTRwb29RUWRxTEY0RTRaNVdQejdiYVB2eU04dlB6TmpBYzNtTHBBU0E9PQ==

close to the metal in ds is similar to engineering when you are implementing papers directly into cjava for example in algo trading you need to identify a strategy and then get rid of all the overheads you can to make it work nlp and maybe image voice recognition are areas where pre trained models are leveraged because the cost to train one from scratch requiers an absurdly high amount of resources for most prediction ans forecasting tasks people do build models from scratch though i also agree that transformation and grid search has actually taken away from the fun of hand training the models,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMUw0aElGaEpxS0J6V2NrMHhkbkZvMWstTE5VU2haUE4xdFN6LWVoU1EwOWlDZGpIaWxnaU05UjJxN1VpOUc1MC1ndWJxeDgzbXNzQ1BtbmswOHE0Q0E9PQ==

do you think the competitive advantage comes more from the sophistication of the models or more from the speed they can run an easy answer is both but lets assume you could simplify make easier and abstract away only one of them so all the focus could be on the other would you simplify the models to innovate the engineering or would you simplify the engineering to innovate the models,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlOWJOOWR6WU5qN3FyeG85dHNzazROcmUyTEoyTTR0eS1mekhSZml1RDZWWTh5UzdpTFdqR3FkaWdmQTB3cGV0Mms0V0N4Y3pjUVZGLUktNURnMFdYSVE9PQ==

ill provide an alternate or perhaps even complementary suggestion sometimes you may want to do a constrained optimization problem where an unknown parameter lets call it p pops up and becomes critical then you set p to be a value based on a linear regression that is to say there are alternate approaches to doing more interesting work than just eschewing the objective functions and structures provided in tools like sklearn,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMENwNm82UGlUeG85Rkp2ZlpCeWJQSUd3UExPLWtFMGZvQ0lOUVR6ZG1OclhWT0ZXRUdGOE9QX2h5X0VZSjZ1N0wtcmg5YTJvcGpCRDBVcDlESElFamc9PQ==

start with a project idea that youre interested in for example one of my first projects was about predicting chemical properties given a set of molecules via graph neural networks because i have an academic background in chemistry this sort of project assumes you already know the fundamentals of coding and you know or are capable of learning an ml framework like torch if youre stuck i would look to kaggle for inspiration and general code style for creating training and validating an ml model the good thing about kaggle is that it has a vast set of ml challenges with great code once you implement a model this is where the software comes more into play you have a model now what can you do with it this is a great opportunity to learn about how to optimize your code make it available on the command line etc i recommend looking at docker and streamlit to start make a usable tool that others can use and make sure it runs optimally has logs and error handling etc im a big advocate of learn by building if you need something thats more structured there are a lot of tutorials out there thats not to say you wont need tutorials when building though,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRnI2YUJKNWZOdkpwUlM4d2ZwUXBiNDhHbmRxc1dmbUVxcHBZRFh3RE1jd2VGc2cwTVlLOVhGMjVIM1NIX3Zxb1VXM2ZhRVFZMFRuekpWR3BoSzNXbmlzTTFKajdaT3lRZTJROEEzWHVZOTQ9

there is also a big consideration that developing efficient implementations of the math is a very difficult and time consuming task in itself do i know enough math to write an mcmc sampler sure but no way would it be anywhere near as efficient or reliable as what the stan team has produced understanding the math of your algorithms is useful to promote good practice but its definitely not worth many ds or analysts times to reinvent the wheel and program them from scratch when there are high quality implementations that already exist,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbWNNYmRGa1JNOVhvQUF2cWNyV1dHWWZ1Z1R2bko2dmJFRFBlRW5wRmwwOHhCeHZ0Tmh2X01BTUhxUnFsMENsRWQ2ai1qcEk5VHBseFRJSkdERGwwdkE9PQ==

i love python because its great for numerical and statistical analysis and there are a lot of great libraries for that kind of stuff i went to grad school for population genetics and it was the language we all used i love c++ because its super fast i would avoid c c++ is just c with objects c isjust procedural so i love to develop with python because you can develop really quick you dont have to keep compiling you know code test code test code test i know when i have a program or script running properly then i will rewrite into c++ and hopefully be done but sometimes there is more rewriting but development is basically over since youre already a programmer you dont need to relearn about data structures loops or all the other stuff because all program and language says have the same capabilities just a matter of syntax so you do not have to learn the syntax and you just need to learn to call variables one of the online sites that i used online books to learn python was written by a computer science professor introduction to computer science use java which i hate anyway she started using python because its a great language to learn on you dont have to declare variables you dont have to deal with get rid of garbage that is all the things that youve used that you dont need to use anymore and you need to deal with the free up memory python does that automatically c++ you have to deal with that so i highly recommend c++ and i would say that the approach i described is probably the best way to use python and c++ together python is actually written in c so just using the python native code is super fast when you actually have to use your own code and then call python functions and libraries thats where it slows down also you can write c or c++ programs and call them from python programs and then write a script to integrate a bunch of programs bunch of libraries,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRG8ydTltUk85clRpWWxZeDNiLVJWNXRzMHdZV1l0QzNvUG80S1RFaThBelFrQTlHNEFvWEVBaUxqd2Rzb2tmWGhBalYtT2J5d293UkpROWFLaVRoTFE9PQ==

linkedin is the best place some job postings on linkedin will say who posted the job others wont for the ones that dont you should reach out to recruiters at the company asking about the job and who is working on it even for jobs not posted on linkedin id go there to make contact with recruiters at the company some will point you in the right direction others will ignore you in every message make sure to introduce yourself and the skills experience that you have relevant to the job also make sure that youve already applied to the role its a lot to do but its really one of the only things you can do to set yourself apart from the loads of applicants theyre receiving,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZXlSYU01SG9jeG5ESmx5SFlNT0lXelNQTy1fbi01VWRuT1hWVk5URXJSR3Awbkt4MG5TcmtXcGlUNGxCbFZqcE83M0ZxbXRhalJhNXdJdkVuR2hCSjBLTDRwbUFpWUwtUGh1MS1PMUNiYTA9

i dont fully understand the problem you are trying to solve but my <number> from previously working on solar gen forecasting if you havent seen the pvlib python library id recommend checking it out it nothing else it makes it easy to pull nwp forecast data in your case solar irradiance as an input to solar gen forecasts if you dont have any background in nwp models it might be overwhelming but honestly irradiance forecasting is probably the most important piece of pv gen forecasting so its worth understanding depending on your forecast horizon you prolly want to use the hrrr for short term gfs for longer term they also have functionality to convert solar gen forecasts into power generation i think in general this approach will do close to the best you can get for general pv generation forecasting heres a paper that seems to have some details <url> if this sounds too in depth for what you need i saw someone recommend a nearest neighbors type approach based on similar weather days thats a lot simpler and will do a decent job get irradiance forecasts find top n days in recent history with a similar profile average pv gen for those days as your forecast,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbFNiT1ViYjNmbVdzTC1LekY1Mi1IMTVQblhfUlp4a1NRWkltd19rQ1JWc0tNWmZicl9icVBIbllBcXI3VVQ0UDQ4Q3haTkVuZ0pNeExNbzFKX2lDc1h4bjd6aF9uWGFmRkpnS29aZllrRFE9

got it yeah nothing youve said changes my vote that id take the swe gig if i were you if you already had that degree in biomedical engineering and a cool deep learning project to go with it then it would be neat and wed be having a conversation about how you can use that experience to spin your resume as a good fit for a ds job but the marginal value doesnt seem that high when you already have a ds masters and when the second masters wouldnt be in one of the typical fits like cs stats math you said you wanted a de or ds role eventually being a swe is a very lateral move to de so having swe experience directly helps there and it indirectly helps with moving to ds more than i expect another masters would and you get paid for the next year or two instead of either having to pay or not making much money even if the new degree is free edit and more succinctly if the goal of all this is to get a job and you have a job offer in hand seems wise to just take it right even if you cant get into the exact same program again it seems very likely you can always go back to school again later for another masters if you want toneed to,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNFhFWUZITi1VUG5NWWxoSkxQSWdCSzE0NkhmdEhyaW1xZVdmREVFWkVCNFpOa2dSbng0TFNzR2FuMHJYYkVOcHJWYV9icHFaVURITDBFbzZwRGxZZ3c9PQ==

i totally agree for context these are data analyst roles requiring <number><number> years of experience and they have the automatic application process with a place to link a portfolio every other job ive applied to this past year at bigger companies asked for links to portfolio thats why i was wondering i also didnt get second round interviews so im wondering if its so competitive that hr is using portfolios to weed candidates out i actually prefer interviews like the one you described because ive done well and received a job offer for the <number> that did call back out of s its just the automatic screening process at bigger companies i really like my current job and manager he has over <number> years of industry experience and was able to tell from the interview that i had a solid foundation its also a good place to learn however the salary is literally below poverty wages so i might to have to look for another job when the market isnt so crazy i appreciate your advice and everyones advice here im going to set aside a little time here and there using government or publicly available data for similar projects one day my resume will speak for itself until then have to manage my time better and grind myself into a pulp haha,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldWxrQkNzRUJYOHROTDBSWllpWkRHZnJvdU1qR2s0SGdFXzFPUlpGVjBGTUVlU0hmT3ppdVBwSFg2d1hDZFhPcGtGTHVFMjhKNXhzV0ZjdHEzSVdHZkE9PQ==

this ties in to the earlier debate about whether data science is science or engineering in the old days people probably often did create their own algorithms from first principles so they could make some claim to be doing science however with the development of standard python and r packages what most people do now is closer to engineering while it is true that being able to do things from first principles makes a person more versatile as a data scientist it is hard to justify the time and effort in todays work world domain expertise will trump mathematical chops almost every time as the earlier commentator suggested whether seriously or in jest better to invest your effort in things that will make you money going forward,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMUM2VkFpekRrbTBaRUEyVXg4QkxrckNmOS1wRTlLTmNfT05hemxuLVRTVzdVeXNkaU5xbnNGSW8zcjIxbndiSm50cTlDQzB2R2JOZk1ydEhqRldhRW41Umg0UnVoX0pvNmZaSmJnaGlfRTg9
it all depends on how much experience you have before the break and how long the break was and whether you actually have the skills or are just missing some skills you might consider applying for similar roles getting a job picking up skills then moving to data analysis you can also look for volunteering opportunities that involve any data analysis i dont think bootcamps are worth the money right now when you are doing a big transition the market is difficult and many bootcamps are the same money as grad degree for instance check out the georgia tech analytics masters which is online and k total while a bootcamp can cost that or more though prices of bootcamps in the uk might be different,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlU3k3UXdSSTFwc05nT0xEYUFEZ1p3ODUwQ3pxZlJCZjVHaGhTVWZjOUxfYlBFYVU5RDdjOHlLOTZkU3UtTEVLV044ckJrdXdFQU5EUHR5ZTVJQXJVV1hManZsTURGSlBSTm5oRXp2YWdGbWM9
so i am in this particular situation where i am studying bachelors of science of business administrations with an emphasis on business analytics and a minor in computer programming this business program had me take calculus statistics and operations management i enjoyed them all so decided to declare business analytics as my emphasis which has taught me data structures basics of ai data analysis with r big data and so much more i also completed the certificate program associate data scientist with python on my own as i wanted to improve my skills in python plus with the computer minor i had the opportunity to learn computation and various other coding languages i really wanna continue my studies with a masters and want it to be a science degree potentially a data science degree however i am missing linear algebra as it was not in my curriculum i took advanced level linear algebra in my german high school and enjoyed it thoroughly but its not ap or anything transferrable here is a simple question what do i do,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMk9wRmZsWUtHRVhNbmNweG5nZUNKYndzSlFiZi1Nc0xqdEQzWkttc1lrWkt0WjFTc20zT0hZSmV0b3Z5TVhUYWlVRVUzeTg0Z0R4RzhxMkhnVHV3RGl5ajF5NDU4dlBGNm9kUldtMXZSTjg9

you dont need a portfolio your resume will carry all the weight you need no hiring manager is going to waste time going to your free tableau link just to see a fairly standard dashboard ditto for github ive heard of few hms online who swear they check them but every hm ive ever known and i am one doesnt have the time or desire to go beyond a <number><number> minute skim of the resume my last open role has k applicants tldr portfolios are outdated and a waste of time for everyone involved,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmNEpLYWhTUEtSOWFiM3BnRHR2a2pVUUQwWUFLS1lESWU3ZGlZS1Z0OS1sNno4QTg4My1wSGxYbS1kYWNOU3hfdVhXTWJnRVZuVW80QlhpSmNGMnhVTkE9PQ==
no to clarify im submitting to a lot of companies that require a portfolio as part of the application process the roles say <number><number> years experience and ask for a portfolio link im automatically rejected so it might be a resume in addition to portfolio link i the ones where i get interviews leading to job offers might have asked for a portfolio but the interviews dont go over it they just ask me about my work and projects in all of these cases i think a hiring manager looks at the resume rather than use an algorithm overall i agree with what you said about interviews being better than portfolios but i just need to figure out how to get past the initial resume portfolio stage,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVGV1dkk3aTVwR2R6ZFJBSDI5NGpXSmZkYTZjQnJsa2RmSTF2SDN2TGFQSk1UNXpXNXZ4ci1LSXZpdTF4SlVyT2tpVWZxakxnaTBNVFpmb1BvZjl6OEE9PQ==

to be honest i havent used shiny in a year however based on my experience with it here are the key differences from a user perspective between shiny and rio with rio theres no need to distinguish between frontend and backend you create a component and specify your ui in the build method similar to react or flutter rio embraces modern python features such as type annotations and asynchrony this keeps your code clean and maintainable and enables your code editor to assist with code completions and type checking if i remember correctly shiny supports asynchrony as well in rio you dont need any decorators to make your code reactive it continuously watches your attributes for changes and updates the ui as necessary in case that you are more familiar with shiny than i am i would appreciate it if you could give rio a try and provide us with some feedback this would help us improve rio and make it better ,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmcVNJZmVTRmxOUzAyV1ZldGN2OVRDYzF1NkVmZl83Uk1DRmFiangtZ1Q4VTJtaDlCcXZvSGtkSXR3c1d0WE4yakpSOXZqbUM2UU0yY3I5Vjl6Smo4dGc9PQ==

thats awesome you got the call backs and offer congratulations are you going for a ds role or da role what level that dictates what is usually what keywords or phrases are in play for example when looking for an entry level analyst im looking for a few years of experience post grad and the ability to articulate accomplishment what did you do what impact did it have and why did it matter can elaborate on what that means if youd like note entry level doesnt have to mean entry to the field it can mean entry to the company,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmdXpjX2RQS2szQlhISHdqVUtlRWZIQzhXTFJ3WkNrcnRDZUlWbzR4ZmQyX2ZnNFNGWV9iX0RDVDd3MG1weFd2bGZxRFhqVllMMVg1T0ZhLXhuRG1zd0E9PQ==
ive not used pymc for a while in fact the last version i used was pymc so my thinking could be out of date but for this library to run quickly you need a gnu compiler installed i always work in linux so this will be there out of the box and therefore i have not had this problem however i know people who tried to work with pymc in windows and would encounter a host of issues i would consider using wsl if i were you things work better in general than in regular windows for most things tangentially i feel like pymc was always built on a pretty janky foundation which has historically made things unnecessarily difficult i know they have made a lot of changes so im hoping the latest iteration of the software is a better place,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmR0hfdHV3Y1dJcW5acGhPUkJNb2ctQVk0dDJ3Tm9DM0NLSVZ4NlZQMmJKaHV6c1dJTlRzSEQyWFh2OVU3WjI4emJwdXZTMGZ0OTRZZlVnX3NydC02R2c9PQ==

as long as your language is understandable i wouldnt worry about the accent everyone speaks with an accent the thing you can do to instantly improve your speech is to pick a better pace of speech many techies speak way too fast which makes their speech grating and harder to follow especially when you are talking about technical things it makes you sound rushed and anxious rather than calm and collected another is speaking from your stomach rather than your throat you can look it up it is a thing singers and actors do it gives you a fuller often a tiny bit deeper voice it can be an even bigger improvement if you normally have a nasal voice even worse than speaking from the upper throat you can learn these two things today and i guarantee that you will see a vast improvement i used to do a bunch of theater and singing and still get compliments on my voice to this day,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmenFkdk1vWUNpd2xQOE9fZGhXQUZMb2NEUWZmVXpJMnUxUHFpLWF1WDZXVGlDUElOVVJySHFwcVE1ZXBIVDBGazRXSkx4UWVvUE5FNjNrVWFuTlpqdE1EcG5xbEUtazFoSHU4dS1VLWlWZGc9

for graduate positions it depends a bit on the country for example in india we are looking also but not exclusively which university youre from for european countries that matters less to us usually next youd need a combination of street smart and education smart to make it through the interview process the education smart we test during the interview with standard questions i personally still like to ask can you overfit a multiple linear regression the street smart part you could demo through some sideprojects youve done eg your own git repository or by showing that you have worked for some student club at university or whatever just anything that demonstrates you have some passion for something in life for the interviews many people think that they can somehow trick their way through the interview when it comes to personality by saying the right thing i have never seen that working you cannot make yourself appear different than you are ive seen my share of narcissists too there are ways how to detect them with some certainty also we are interested in graduates who have the intention to stay at least for some time and not just change one year after being hired depending on the country there is a tendency to jobhop and that is frustrating for an employer last but not least if you dont make it through the interview process dont take it too personally sometimes we have two or even three very good candidates only one can be picked and making a choice is hard so dont take a no immediately as an indicator of personal failure look at it more like a keylock problem its about the right fit whatever that mean if you get a no then well it was not the right fit from the perspective of the employer,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmcW5PeUdZejBEQ0xXQzBjMEVNZVloR2NtWmxtZ1VXSmpDZW96VUdvY21yOFdNNDBMeVRHd21Vc0hBa2hxXzJjZXVEeG9SbG9ZSG40ZXY5YnR4SjZDR2c9PQ==

i am not located in the usa but in europe and honestly i dont care about the reputation of your university too much when you apply with us as i stated we may take this as a sort of quality stamp in countries like india but its not a guarantee for anything neither but maybe thats different in the anglosaxon countries which are typically paying more attention to such things obviously if you want to work in the usa and have a masters degree from any us university then that will be helpful for companies there to trust your degree but then youd have to pay extremely high university fees that might potentially be just not worth it its hard to generalize these matters so i can just share whats going on around me in our company,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmUUlqQm5JaUJ5Q1I3U1V1WUVOOXFHVDdpSU9pUEVGSUs4clgtcHkwdjdkS1ZfaEFyLUhselhvUGJwb0xBZXhYS09wbmhaSjVRUzZTQXp1S2kzbDNnd0E9PQ==

think hard if you dont want to do a masters degree thats better than any interview preparation because you go again into the depths of certain topics of course you could also work for a year and then still pursue a masters degree thats my personal view on things could be others see it differently preparation for an interview hard to generalize make sure you understand what the companys business model is its astounding how few candidates even try you dont have to be an expert but at least try to understand how they earn their money that makes the difference between random candidate and interested candidate,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmTXNFV1ZBVUN3Wm1qV19FbWNIQk1VVVpraFNscTdRM1ZTNEwwTTB1am5uRm1MVVpudTNtX3c4aTZTLVdVNXhycjNvNC1ZbkNHd01uSHhIeFMzajFicmc9PQ==

well if the finances are the bottleneck then you should not go to any anglo saxon university for example there are plenty of pretty decent universities some really great ones too in europe that have substantially cheaper university fees of course you wont have the stamp yale or whatever rocks your boat on your cv but you also wont have a huge debt to start with check for example the swiss federal institute of technology not sure what their prices are for foreigners but its a top university with a huge international reputation and most likely they are a lot cheaper than most unis in the usa then again you also wont get the crazy salaries you might get in silicon valley but on the other hand you get a lot of other benefits in many european countries for example some level of job security perhaps not that important as long as youre young but if you have debts to pay off that might be relevant to you nonetheless,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmYmh2NHJBUXRXMjZPXzNxU0p3Rk9rS045c25FOEZVY3c5SFU5bVhEdU92SEs1alY2LTFlVk1NUEtZQWJibEN5ZW9CNHFFclNmdzE0M0o2c3JHNkNkbVE9PQ==

your best course of action isnt to pursue a second masters degree right now your best course of action is to get some work experience if you dont have any definitely start applying to data scientist jobs but if you arent getting any hits from that start applying to data analyst jobs a lot of companies now want at least a little experience working with data professionally before hiring data scientists,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmQ0doZXJzWHd5QzVXU0t2VmtkU0kwcHdqWG1pdlc4ZzQwdkJtek1uWXhJQUpKQnVWeFRQclhLOGk3OU9oRl82MmFQbjRhU3h6WDF5WDhVaWt6dFpQQUE9PQ==

assuming a phd is off the table you will be much better off pursuing a postgrad research position and building your cv when you are ready to make the jump to industry starting with an internship or newgrad position will be ideal this is because these have less stringent experience requirements after a year or two in these positions you can leverage that experience to find a better position rinse and repeat,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmMG9uOGs0TWprdzhBVjlicG8yWmN4NWJsQm9UMWtkVlJibjRJQllvVllXSTRwckRlQnYzUURaN2d3Z2MwVEdoUFJRdmlFSDZXX3dXcmFVRHZIYk1nMGc9PQ==

likely one of those it depends type of questions full disclosure i have a mba that was paid for by my current employer i did a part time program with a big midwest school that is good at football networking events tend to be pretty well attended which is a plus i think the mba provided a nice rounding of skills or ideas that would be hard to self study unless you are super motivated i was also paired with a career coach which was nice to help think about where i want to go next as far as ds wise i did apply to some tech pm jobs while taking classes had an offer from amazon but didnt like the onsite location the mba just helps to get you into the pipeline if you are looking to pivot a bit i also get more recruiters reaching out for manager roles but i am also a lead so that may not be some much related i liked my classes and learned a good bit i also like the new network to tap into if i had done a full time program and had to take out <cur>k plus in loans i am not sure it would be worth it i have friends who went to t programs and it has worked out for them as they often changed fields,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVFhqMkJmOTlUYXdDX3UzWW01bXhlTlJJY3o2OENGeDBCTnY0SktETHJvZ2h5YktHZGlqV1NOMmYxSmZVR0gzeHBqNHVQZktoR2hIQ0RpZzhEVlE3M1RfU0VtZmtrLUs3azJlekY0WVdtM009

im gonna be honest were jumping the shark with the whole soft skills are the most important thing no theyre not soft skills are important they are by no means the most important thing not in data science not in business in general theres this perception that eg marketing people only build decks and so when you see a marketing executive present a deck that is all they do that is only a part of what they do that is like saying all data scientists do is code in jupyter notebooks the most valuable thing that every person in every function does is solving problems marketings main activity isnt building decks its finding ways to optimize spend across a range of avenues to maximize financial performance even the softest of soft areas strategy strategy lives and dies with decks but again the problem theyre solving for is not building a deck they are solving for strategy problems and the delivery is a deck what is the future of our product how do we intend to react to changing demographicsdemand for our product what are natural extensions of our product line that minimize cannibalization and maximize synergy,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmOGlreE1aUnYxTl9YeEZNeU45U241akhuUmt0ZmpBVkJ2QTVwbk5lWGlDTWlYY3U1cmJBY1VpSWt2TUVLYVdJN0hibHpqT2tPOFpCTm1lS3JQeF9VR0E9PQ==

whilst i agree with most people in their recommendation for you to get a job and to not pursue yet another masters i also do think that your issue may not only be due to a lack of professional experience but rather that you are desperately pursuing education as a solution to your unemployment here are some things you should consider <number> publications many msc ds programmes are course based but companies love research the reason for this is that it establishes you as a subject matter expert and demonstrates your ability to fit into a rd or more research heavy roles whilst it would be better to have published a few papers during your period of study you can always publish independently <number> projects whilst in school and after school work on projects that are captivating personal and most importantly each one should use a programming language or software that solidifies a set of skills programming or statistical that you claim to have on your resume it would be best to display these on github and on a personal portfolio website not necessarily at all but definitely a competitive edge <number> revamp resume reach out to seek feedback on your resume ie contact a recruiter or someone that was recently hired in your desired field of work <number> consider a cs cert or nano degree there are many affordable micro nano certifications available online ie edx coursera etc this can make you more well rounded and can address the skill gaps you believe you have <number> socialize and network go to network events reach out to alumni with similar credentials or in desired field of work on a final note you might need to be a bit more introspective could it be possible that your husband has a done more in the areas listed above,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmeklnX0lWMXhhTFJURHdfZTVudS0zTTZYSjFvZ0JwUm94NGV0MDQwQlo3cnpMNzVmQ3QtSGU1WVBLbm1RZDI4T2xNRUJNWV9wdUthTDNYa1k1dkszSWc9PQ==

where do i fit in best in the world of data do i fit anywhere at all even in the broader tech landscape should i just give up and go live under a bridge for three years i worked as a solutions engineer at an ai startup i applied and was hired as a data analyst but i was given solutions engineer as a title instead early on the problem is <number> im not even really sure if theres a consistent understanding of what a solutions engineer even is in industry and what ive found doesnt align all that well with my actual experience or career goals and <number> that my job for the past <number> years looks almost nothing like what most people call data analysis or any other real data job my job was to work directly with the companys ai framework which was symbolic and nonstatistical and build specific solutions eg computer vision rl multiclass classifiers etc using it i didnt make use of much of my mathematical skills or knowledge of probability and statistics which anyway was never a particularly deep knowledge as ive only taken one course in probability what makes it even worse is that the company was not successful the founder hired a kid with a math bachelors me a kid with a psychology bachelors and a guy who used to teach robotics to build and invent all these supposedly groundbreaking ai solutions surprise surprise getting a bunch of people with no specific ai or cs background to invent reinforcement learning solutions with a completely unconventional symbolic ai framework if it can even be called ai didnt pan out so well so now im in the shitty and unenviable position of trying to figure out where to even fucking look for my next job data analysis postings need sql and data visualization we never had datasets or databases big enough to require sql we werent trying to tell stories with data so data visualization outside of matplotlib or plotly graphs as part of exploratory jupyter notebooks was practically nonexistent i still have sql listed on my resume since i have done some sql lessons and am confident i can google my way to solutions if theres any virtue to be had in being thrown into a field youre unqualified for in my case trying to invent useful and scalable solutions with explainable symbolic ai its that you learn to be resourceful with books and google to learn just enough of something to become passable at it data science positions often require expertlevel strength in being able to do statistical modeling ive never really done that despite my entire career so far being in ai i used some baby math and stats for some solutions but most things i was able to do using various python packages i dont have a whole lot of honest stats modeling experience the whole point of the startups ai was that it didnt create models now much of what myself and my poor coworkers tried to do was modeling the outputs of the companys ai to create schemas or frames out of a learned learned in quotations because this ai framework didnt really learn anything knowledgebase but again this was mainly using a lot of premade modules from various python packages and anyway i became so jaded with the companys product and the awful work environment founder was a fucking maniac surprising no one that i basically started quiet quitting after my first year i deeply regret that as i could have at least used work as an opportunity to upskill but hindsight is always <number><number> machine learning engineer positions are closest in description to what i was made to do as a solutions engineer except i dont have nearly the required swe background nor traditional ai background to really be competitive in this space sales engineering which ive often seen as being synonymous with solutions engineering is similar to what a lot of my job actually ended up being building and running demos for clients to try and get them to buy in but i really hated this part of my job and wouldnt particularly enjoy doing this for a living i much preferred the more behindthescenes technical aspect of my role the even bigger problem is that sales or solutions engineering roles are all very dependent on what specific technologies industry and products the company is seeking support for i only have experience with this one shitty ai startup whose foundational technology is not used anywhere else because it was made up by the founder who never bothered to put the resources into actually making it scalable and production ready data engineering is a nonstarter as i didnt really handle large volumes of data whatsoever much of our work was using basically toy datasets to build rd demonstrations that were basically like stupid little puppet shows wed put on for prospective customers oh and the customers i was lucky enough to have been the lead engineer on the only paid contract the company ever won throughout my entire threeyear tenure there is it any wonder we went under i went in knowing that the company mainly marketed itself to dod and ic customers but felt i had no choice but to accept the only offer i had after <number> months on the market i hate the defense industry no offense to the people who serve our country but its just not my environment and not something i like i took on the aforementioned contract hoping it would ensure a paycheck through a very stressful period of my life and felt that it was my only choice for keeping the bills paid i hated it the entire time but its pretty much the main thing i have to talk about regarding my experience there i had an actual paying client who i was accountable to thats only experience i have like that the problem is that it seems to me that the data world is very industry dependent so now i feel like im sort of locked in to the defense industry i had people trying to help refer me to their own companies but none of them wanted anything to do with my application even with referrals the connections i happen to have are mainly media and marketing data professionals who i was generously introduced to through a family friend these companies want people with media and marketing backgrounds not me i feel like i killed my career before it even started by letting my first job be at a shitty ai startup that tried and failed at playing war

the employees of the client did inhouse tests not that high participation rate and well i dont know why we cant get more my boss just says were not gonna open testing again why is beyond me what we do have is a lot of employee performance data each day an employee worked we got data on their performance on a kpi and other data points that relate to factors that influence the kpi like miles driven etc the best idea i have is to use all the data to train an initial model on a traintestvalidation set then use the predicted kpi performance of the employees that did the tests so about <number> in total and use the inital models predictions as the outcome variable of the next model that way i can control for the factors that influence performance get accurate predictions and see how the testrelated variables can be used to explain these initial predictions is this a valid approach do you think,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmWnNjbFNXel9vS0FKVzdyQkotNkJGQXBwZ3NlRnVud0c1TjRmVDJTTUExVnpuVzRZTlAxQ0hodVdYczBGSGtBSHFwVUhRRk5aZ01WVm9NTjJCSVlLQWc9PQ==

you list a lot of stuff without saying what you did why or how just listing cleaning data or supporting data related projects is not going to make people think oh ill call this person im not saying cleaning data is not a good skill or a good thing to have on the resume im saying that you need to add more like if it was a lot of data you can add numbers or you can say what you did exactly eg duplicates merging missing data text data data quality etc,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmdGxtbE44RTN4NkpKdTh1NnhnQVp3d0xTLTdRRllNaDhVdDdTUDE1UzFoWlpWOUloV1ZjRDZxMHBBOWloSUNJTjRXRXU4ZEdiTk85TDllY0IxbVV5aVNYc3pfanJpUkZZdGl3S09JYjF6d1U9

my recommendation dont be an eternal student if you want a phd pursue it for the research but otherwise with a masters its time for a career to start whatever roadblocks that are there with your current masters will be there after the second work to overcome those first treat your approach to the job market as a timeboxed experiment if youre not seeing outcomes reformulate and try a new set of hypotheses,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVi0tZDU1VEZ3cnl3ZTVPamtRVVV5TzRWQ3hyVFo1TGNoSGhCYnVtdU9GOHl2UjlseUdsc3pGTnJZS21DZTQ2R3kzSFJwX2lQcXJOZmJ6UFVHYTZfOVE9PQ==

what actions are you taking for getting job interviews if throwing applications out for every job you might be marginally qualified for thats a losing strategy network with recruiting managers identify gaps in skillset and capabilities find orgs that need your capabilities and that can pay your reserve price which you should also adjust as needed almost every nonnetwork in recruiting channels to a firm is spammed to death by unqualified people to the point where intake might be <number> we recently put out a rec and had <number> applicants in two hours but only <number> were close to qualified,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmakJJWkVLV0xPUVY0X0VaeXV2U2JYclhOXzk0NGplcTktblAwcEtVZ3RKbjBURkxkQjAwRjlXeXEzSW9GczhqaW81M0o4M2JVQ2FOWGt3RWJobHRMOXc9PQ==

i was a hiring manager for a large data analytics department and i worked with recruiters a lot i think youre running up against a couple of issues with no relevant work experience you should be commanding an entry level rate however you have a ms degree which usually means that the applicants will want ms level money those two things dont mesh so recruiters or the screening systems theyre using will automatically filter you out to get around this you need to do a few things first go to career fairs at your school because the employers showing up there will be specifically looking for folks with your specific degree second you need to network hard find out what employers youre interested in and start doing some linkedin research youll likely know somebody who knows somebody at that organization try and get an informational interview or even something less formal to discuss the company and the department youd want to work in third use your career center at the school to review and update your resumes they really arent intuitive to build especially with all of the technological hoops they have to get to before ever being seen by a human being chatgpt can be useful but the folks at your school build and polish resumes for a living so they cant be beat lastly i definitely would not recommend another degree unless you get a phd and become a researcher or rd another degree will price you out of the market even more,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsYnJleGpyV1gzdFZwVWRvVkM4SEJCX29vbEtwSnhuN1Nqc3BUSTgtWjVkcEZLYTJQOW8ycmprZ3VoSFdBZnp3QkIyVzJEVlE3VjY5am9yYUJDa0xkclE0VUdva2NoNHc5VmNTaUw0MnBGQm89

both professions are in high demand nowadays but mles are definitely more employable than dss just as an fyi mles are more of softwareplatform engineers which is very different than what you have been doing as a data science intern sure mles handle machine learning solutions but they typically do not spend their time researching and prototyping the solution they are rather focused on the deployment scaling and mlops the ones who do research and prototyping are the dss,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsdzBaUDJ4bXlTS2t0SFdzUFpPZHRnUkNiRUE3OUNFT0x1NE5JUFY4YUs3RnVKelVoZl9jSWR5MzU3UTRZZTQ0WENEZTh3YWU0QklDQmV4U0ZLQzdqaXc9PQ==

generally for this setting id recommend to look into bayesian structure learning for pgms see koller friedman chapter <number> <url> they develop standard metrics to quantify the match of the learned structure to the data the only details here to be careful are i watch out for data size their methods dont scale well so you might need to write your own libraries ii be careful about how you represent the sequence especially if there can be loops non dag can potentially break basic bayesian network assumptions then of course you can also simplify and approach with traditional methods for ci to get a sense good luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsM2stUDhlUUkwcDlmdDFKOERzeTBaSmhnb0hrZk1SaldEOHdqMVZnNE9xRzR6M25BOUtJUEcxekxIQS1IZHJMMmMyWTZiN2JzLTZXWXAtRkV6YjNfS1E9PQ==

based on reading this im skeptical that you know what finetuning is this tutorial doesnt appear to have any finetuning in it and you use encode and finetune interchangeably which is odd this post read more like a very basic intro to the sentence transformers library that misuses quite a bit of terminology encoding documents to vectors with sentence transformers and then saving those vectors to disk is not finetuning and is not making a new model this is likely confusing enough that id recommend unpublishing the post and going all the way back to research how you would actually fine tune a pretrained model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsSnZmNE1lZ3lROUVxTmc2c29rZ3dBZEE4SVlaRUNad1NXdUYydHF5aER0U0ktNVc1Z01GNlJ5N3RRVm1MQWhmN0ZKdW1PWE5rT2FtakUtSDdnS1VqaUE9PQ==

because you are using a time series as input the first approach should yield better results you have <number> measures of the same thing at different moments so your values are correlated and between days you should observe periodic values i would suggest to approach this problem from the point of view of extreme values analysis eva you could first suppose that your <number> points are iid and then use more complicated approaches using time series there are python implementations of eva such as pyextremes but the documentation of r packages is more complete for example you could read extreme values statistics analysis using r i am sure you will find a problem equivalent to yhe one you have in that book,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsQkdtUmZuS0daZzhvVUwtVlZRaThfbVlodll6WXZnNklrX2l0bEIwRXJyVWhJN3ZWQ3RlcFU0SjVnOEpBSnVPcGxJX09KaUREWTg5ZlBPanNhaGtRT1E9PQ==

so imo you should rather use quantile regression consider a simple model with no features then the model is just the average of the max power over your sample is that what you want or do you want to include the variability so predicted upper bound = averagemax temp + <number> stddevmax temp quantile regression will take into account that variation too,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsWGFWQlZWbUdadi1CVXNuVlFPUjN4NGpFMUEzZjdUN242WVVYUnA2MzZrbl9yZkhCXzZlY0RHdk5oeGpHdno1aTdwdlRKaUVlWUEzazdueV9TSkxXeFE9PQ==

you would need to do by day not by <number> points this is because they are all correlated lets say max sun is <number> of day since clouds randomly pop up even on the sunniest of days then using <number> maxed you might get <number> sun which might never happen another way you could do it is making a model that predicts sun output based on weather report data then get historical weather data to predict sun output from historicals then calculate max using that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsR0hMcFFkQlZ1akN2Yno1WGxxaXl1TmpwbzFNckladzZPamNKclZvaUo1V1VwVG43N2FuNUdpb0ZlUWRGeGNsanp6dzFVenVoaU0tSHplNHViWlpPeEE9PQ==
how would you go about creating a ml model to predict the max temp the only way i can think of now is to create a data set with say <number> features being the max temp of the past <number> days and build it with this moving window the target being the max temp of the following day if you had <number> years of data that would be <number> data points with a window size of <number> the dataset would have <number> rows but then there might be high correlation between features anybody knows a better approach,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsOVRvTGxWV1RwQWZXUHltMUlZVC14WWlBTnVUcElGbzFDcVZsOE53SzJNM09lOXVRTmttSlJfdDUtQXA1V3J6S016UU5OdW5GYjltc3RxUUJGaGxMR3c9PQ==

imo being closer to maths is more beneficial if you aim to specialize in a researchfocused industry or if youre working on cuttingedge paradigms like creating new implementations in a new programming language or implementing new models from the latest research papers this requires understanding the intricacies of ml algorithms and various optimization methods however you dont need this level of expertise to grow as a data scientist in a typical role where the goal is to bring value to shareholders whatever this means developing new algorithms and implementations is timeconsuming and requires highly specialized teams frankly its not something <number> of data scientists need daily as their primary focus is solving business problems within short timeframe this can almost always be addressed using conventional methods eg from sklearn import that said having a solid understanding of whats happening under the hood is highly beneficial for example when building a neural network model defining the correct loss function is crucial the models performance depends on the neural net architecture and the loss function chosen understanding these aspects helps avoid going down the wrong rabbit hole and solves problems faster than those without this knowledge but theres a balanceyou need to know just enough,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsc1FCajd0eEQ0bUkyZnZlcHpXQTR0b2llVl9CVlVHdUEycF95dVFfbTZCY3NtNmFrQTc4TlVhUzBFR3puUXRjNHdHdHlZT19OMXlVTkhwd2VJYkFyckE9PQ==

first things first i am currently familiarising myself with text mining and am still very much at the beginning i dont want or expect any readymade codes for my problem i would like to describe my project below and would be grateful if someone could give me ideas or methods for a rough approach as the topic is simply very complex to understand i would like to recognise trends based on a database of scientific articles such as trends like ai chatgpt securityi have started to clean the data stop words and am currently experimenting with lda the problem is that i often get words that occur frequently but are not trends per se eg data or management is there a way to analyse the text and get only words which could be trends i suspect that this might go in the direction of machinedeep learning to build a model that looks at whether a word is a trend or not but as i said i would be grateful for any feedback or a roadmap with the core terms or methods for implementation if i have forgotten any important details i will be happy to add them if required thank you very much,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtWWw1Q0VBLXltVi11ekdjUE9PS3RjVUlfenp6eWgxekhlZ0ltOFRDR1FmSFVBczBWZTNVN3hlV2lMWmVkRDkzcFJoczhqTVl2cUpUNGJya2Y3TWkzbWc9PQ==

i work in data analytics at a pretty big solar farm i am trying to think of how you would make a model to predict the total max output and it seems likely that model would still include many minipredictions for each hour im not sure where you are but where i am maximum solar output is on average around noon or a little earlier that isnt the time of maximum sunlight but it is the time when the sunlight is highest compared to the heat as solar panels lose efficiency when they get too hot this is ignoring cloud cover and more true in the summer when it is most hot so the biggest factors in solar power output are solar irradiance and temperature solar irradiance can be calculated pretty well except for cloud cover so i usually split it into <number> solar irradiance cloud cover and temperature all three can have massive effects on your model the main crux is that the interactions between them arent really linear like a <number> chance of clouds at <number> pm is meaningless unless there were cloud at <number> pm so you would need to build a model to predict the chance of clouds at <number> pm first if there is a <number> chance of clouds then then you would want to go to the next time lets say <number><number> and predict the chance of clouds again there is a <number> chance there were no clouds at <number> and this <number><number> model doesnt matter but that also leaves <number> chance the clouds were there at <number> and this <number><number> model is needed predicting the chance of clouds at <number><number> is more complicated though because it will be correlated with the <number><number> model so it might be a <number> chance of clear skies but only like a <number> chance of clear skies after the <number><number> had cloud cover i apologize for the wordiness of it as i started getting into it i kept remembering more things we need for our own models i hope i made the idea of the model clear though we start with the time that should be the best ignoring cloud cover and temperature then we work forward and backwards in time from there it is mostly individual models at each time increment but there are a couple variables we pass between the models to deal with the correlation between them other things to consider cloud cover does not mean no power we have to account for chance of cloud cover percentage of sky covered by clouds and cloud opacity some clouds are thin but dont completely kill power output do your panels have trackers or are they stationary we have some panels that dont track and theyre positioned slightly off so they get more power later in the day as energy prices tend to go up then,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtM1p0ZVNRTy1YUHpLbUhUOGU3bjlDamJOeTBDVDVPWi05YnROVXRfRF9nZURDRzhpZGNUQWhTU0s2WGQ3VHlhaFRRV0tzd3dmbjcxdFFhdk1vS21uRDRfSkJabTJzSEZsZUdoYVp5Sk9aRlE9

first i dont think you know which ones are wrong in production if you did you wouldnt use a model you should probably take a step back and consider data balance and whether accuracy is the right metric it probably isnt and youre thinking your model is better than it is look into precision recall and fscores as part of validating you might want to characterize and understand the types of errors the model makes maybe you want to collect more data or do augmentation to reduce specific types of errors once you have everything properly validated you have to accept some error coming through the pipeline track as many metrics as you can to understand how data inputs and pipeline outputs are changing over time as the data evolves over time your measurements of generalization and error analyses will no longer hold significant change should alert you to retrain additionally think of ways you can collect some feedback on predictions if possible to generate newer datasets to train with edit typo fix,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtQUZvcDJTVVhHWlBSVzlJNlVtMURLd2RkLW45eV9ReV9XcWc0bVFaalBTa003ZG05NFRtWUZGMUUwTFk1QjIzQ210QzBHMmJVejRGSDdHbGlHS0ZrU1E9PQ==

are you certain you can get admission for an ms in applied math at a top <number> i ask because i dont know your background academically and it might not be the cost that holds you back tbh depending on where your ugrad and ds degrees are from a nd ms in math from a school that places directly into tech university of washington for amazon for example or better might be worth it if you did your ds degree online at a large school like georgia tech or something id definitely encourage it that being said i think you could break <cur>k in a hcol area in <number> years depending on your role in finance without the nd ms given your econ + ds background you could probably do a product role at a fintech company and pivot into financial product roles at a faang eventually,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtUXh0YXN6YUM5V0J0NHRYSGVCcTYzc2lveUh3eGpVRld2b0dNS3RaQXNKaWZyTEM5Y0E0VUdWWVlJZ09YQnhjSHpGMFctNDF2Z1Y5czlFQ2VpYVROWFE9PQ==

oh this is easy you could get the team version of githubgitlab usually costs like <cur><number> a user and host code there and then use a self hosted runner to deploy the code to the server with jenkins or another tool do yall have a developer team or devops team who does code releases,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtVjBqZEhuMFdSVjgtMHR1LUJGVHk5aXRQOXcxakZLSk4tMkxkZFRpNjBBR05kenZEaEJkTk5mM2tnYjM3MzktbjkweTYxNklWZUpEcGFSSVFuNzBzU1E9PQ==

what about containerising the model i think mlflow can make it easy once you register the trained model which is pretty easy for most python models literally a couple extra lines in your training script then the model can be packaged into a container and queried through an http endpoint you could containerise the streamlit app and then connect the <number> containers together though version control is probably the very first upgrade you need here,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtUmV5OEtuYkRnY1V5QThfemMxTktZNFZDN00yb2UwVE9pVm9GQ09VeXdGSWtJWWFzWjhFNFpRTnAzN0FhRXJTYzltTUtoN1NpSnBHcUlXVE0yU3RfVWc9PQ==

just to add to what others already mentioned version control would be the first priority for a couple of things <number> you can track code changes better <number> you dont have to manually copy and paste code from dev to prod you can separate dev and prod branches <number> prevention of catastrophic failure that is if your server suddenly shuts down you would still have backup for all versions deployed in prod git is pretty cheap these days i think the bigger challenge for you is how to drive that transformation using soft influence i suggest that you propose a poc for using git for version control of your projects if they see how much more efficient that would be compared to your current setup they might consider your suggestion,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtcnJJQ2JtdmZNaHJTanB2dnVXQVVSZTFsYVVxeUVDYTZrZ2E4OTFWeUwyekUtd0dqSDRvX2wxSnhJQ2ZvU3ZNeHRNS0ZmWnlEa3ZmOGpYS1NfYUhsamc9PQ==

as a current data engineer this fits with my preconceptions and i agree wholeheartedly we do all of the heavy lifting and the precious little data scientists just write a couple of <number> line scripts to randomly split the data into different subsets and run linear regressions or if theyre feeling fancy machine learning libraries on the output they then expect people to treat them like nobel prize winning particle physicists only joking you guys are great and ive done enough data sciencing in my time to know that its harder than it looks to be honest from where i am the biggest problem i see for data scientists is that the ones i work with at least rely on models which dont have a close enough resemblance to the real world to be useful with the data things like assuming that all amounts will be positive when in the real world things like negative repayments exist assuming that a company will only offer n products when in reality they offer n assuming that most data fields will never be null when real world data is sparse generally assuming that their preconceptions about what data should look like are correct and that the real world processes that produce it are somehow wrong when in reality these issues arent a matter of the data needing to be better cleaned or engineered but of data scientists models needing to be adjusted,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtYUczOGNMSFRIVFJaX0h1MU1GUlhVVHVTZ2F6QnRrcHNlcnlxN3hjWS1QVGNHbVNrOVg0dXRXYTVBR3BXNko0MzhfRkQzVmRKS181bEh0Z3oxb3h1djVWTTRCbjR6ekJrcndia1FSVHEwTFk9

haha tbh at my org the analyses are so simple that we just do counts and averages i agree that a lot of people dont have a good understanding of the real world and how it relates to the data especially true of the processes that create the data customers have to sign a contract before you can get a rate card a new service has to exist before it has a price on that rate card etc but like my gripe is that the current engineering solutions makes engineers life easier and life for end users harder i cant run an explain plan on my queries because all of the upstream tables are views and the recommended solution is to create a table version of the view into your own schema which defeats the purpose of using upstream objects im not looking for the most perfect data model or anything but give me the tools to write an efficient query that i can run reliably,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuVmtZQTA2ZWp6OGxhVGJoLVFvVFgxOHBUMHUyeWJaR1ZEaUlDSEJ0cDk2eGNlUGwzWGFtbVJzWERXcHNZaGFJd3UyLUJPZC1zNERkQkZTUHdDNDVwS1E9PQ==

i work in the social sciences and believe in consumer lead decision making the problem is qualitative researchers are not statisticians and do not realise that quantity matters to ensure an effect is not missed they assume that getting repetition of answers is a negative thing what they dont realise that to ensure sufficient power they need a much larger sample to reach the <number> power level for any size of effect they want to measure <number> depth interview just not hack it this leads to model mispecification and so data models only take into account effects that are measured the other big problem in social science is measurement error there is this bad trend of increasing scale sizes so across respondents the answers are different on a <number> point scale one persons <number> is anthers <number> or <number>,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJueS1RSUFyakFTNWhCZWRRVWNoMHNieDZWWnh5QWdab0lxWDZfLXVRQ01aWnhSWWZYdGJhVk5YTTdYdkZMYTU1OWZDWXZpSEpwcFExby1SNExyVzFGU0E9PQ==

as powerfultiger said the free causal inference for the brave and true is a great intro if you come from the machine learning world other than that causal inference and discovery in python by aleksander molak is good but i find all examples too simplistic but great for learning as well last the author of causal inference for the brave and true has also recently released a more complete version of the free book search for causal inference in python from matheus facure it is complementary to the brave and true rather than a full replacement as for today i consider those three to be the best ones,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM2NqOHVHWGhVNWJ0R3ZWcGY3UU91Zm1Xalc4MHh4a1hpRElDN0k5OHozNk83R3Znd2JiQldUWU9iU241bDR6bGZHR1RQaU9ZbU9wMzNXei16aThBQ3c9PQ==

ive read a bunch here are what i found useful in ascending order of usefulness causal inference for statistics social and biomedical sciences an introduction incredibly verbose and very mathematical ruben or maybe its imbens writing is just so long winded that you can safely skip paragraphs at a time only recommended if you want a very mathematical treatment of the subject the effect andor mixed tape these books are written at the same level by the same type of person my advice would be to pick the book according to color the effect is teal mixed tape is orange pick what you like i think mixed tape has r and python code so maybe that will swing you one way or another my chief complaint about these books is that they are very example driven which is hard when i know next to nothing about the topic eg police stops education etc etc counterfactuals and causal inference methods and principles for social research good book that explains dags and a bunch of introductory causal inference methods i think reading this is when causal inference really started to click for me but lacks explanation of several topics eg regression discontinuity the treatment is fairly general with repeated applied examples used in the book this is an improvement over the last two in my own opinion what if good book by one of the most important people in modern causal inference very good treatment of the potential outcomes framework and the only book ive seen which examined the gcomputation i dont think there is <number> book which will teach you everything in my experience reading each of these was nice because some concepts were reenforced while others were reintroduced in new ways which helped me understand a lot of stuff,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM2tlcldzMHhBS2xYY3lnUlBmbjUzbzFTQVNwR04xUnQ0SjVHbzdpMWFLM0lzTlRzTms3OGhPdTU0d3VRY3ZkVXppZWlPeGZSX1d3T0ZiTEFhRFFpTUpqZndqVjc5Y1JvOUlPTmJZbllSbDQ9

for learning causal inference i highly recommend several resources first the books causal inference in statistics a primer by judea pearl and causal inference the mixtape by scott cunningham provide comprehensive insights into the theory and application of causal inference additionally consider taking online courses like causal inference on coursera by duke university and harvards free introduction to causal inference course for visual learners youtube has valuable content including talks and interviews related to the book of why by judea pearl and datacamps causal inference playlist these resources will equip you with a solid understanding of causal inference and its practical uses in your job for those looking to enhance their data science skills and tackle such challenges consider logicmojos<url> courses they offer comprehensive resources on data structures algorithms and problemsolving providing you with the tools to excel in the field and overcome data quality issues effectively,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuLXlZbzNmX2xQWC1xYWk3V1ZYanFURE5oU1AxSElNbk5aajdMbmQxR3lsNkw5d01ja3g1eGZSVWxIaHpwT3l1RzBIbGlSdTlOQjhSQlBKOGRVXzM0a1JFSkJOSGJSTVVqLWhWVkZJc3k2X1k9

pymc is perfectly stable but it can be hard to install because of the c backend used in pytensor which needs to have the right c compilers available heres the conda environment pymc uses to run the windows tests so its a good starting place for a working conda install <url><url> you can add jax jaxlib numpyro and blackjax to use the jax backend with the blackjax and numpyro samples you can also use the nutpie sampler to take advantage of the fast numba backend install via use mamba not conda its waaaay faster mamba env create f windowsenvironmentdevyml,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNHNDQmEyV1ZNbDBzSGVudTloa1d5UnZTRGlQV1hQcGRydENkbGF5elFza0ltWG1Zc0tVXzJ2RUNEV1NpeFBGSFZiNmN2cXFOVkJsWVNZRGVYcnBXWUE9PQ==

perhaps a meeting would be helpful where you could discuss the viability of tools that completely support onpremise installation and use it would be interesting to hear the responses btw an overlooked danger is that it is extremely easy to just copy an excel file to a jump drive and walk away with it which in my nonscientific estimation is more common than a data breach over the network,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJubWZoT09MLU1rWWdXdE5YR096QU1USVpDbUktRDhMYTllektCRDhDeFMxeUhkcmhBbFI1N0xiVUN1Sjl2bThhR2UtajRHY3Z0aVRWRDNmYTFNajRzM2c9PQ==

guessing you wanna do an ms in ds for grad school in that case statistics will be a great advantage here since a lot of ml algorithms are rooted in statistics but youll also be learning calculus in stats which is very important also stats classes will likely teach you programming in r and sas uw would be a better choice for undergrad not only for rankings but also because its in seattle so youre in proximity to a bunch of big companies with ds internships if i could go back without doing a bs in ds the next best thing would be a bs in statistics i recommend getting at least a minor in cs to get more of those programming classes in python and sql are two other huge languages in ds unless you think you can handle a cs + stats double major,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvQzBEWGtwSkRqYXU3M2FvTDhyTXV1amRLdDg5NnUxMGNvcVpaV3VWdXI3ZVl4V191eWlBVzVhS1IxWTB1Tmt1WV9Sbnk2aXFtLS1oOGJFUlRZMHkzQ1E9PQ==

ultimately i think you have to start somewhere there will certainly be ambitions that are unachievable due to selfimposed limitations optimistically the hope is that once we can prove some of the statistical work provides value we can push for better data handling and quality and honestly if they want to pay me to mess around with models all day thats still loads more interesting than some of the work on my plate currently,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvQkNhVVUxYndLTlo2MU5CQk9ycDI1cS0tZFNjbzEwYkxMUkFCc25BbkZlNG02bnJiMW9HQVhleHQyTFp2akNOLU5vM3QtTHRrVlprcGdVaHVrM0RIMGc9PQ==

im not disagreeing with you that there are massive improvements that can and should be made however without having ever actually interacted with any of the data you dont have the context to assert that there isnt anything useful that could be done with it for instance data security is important but its not directly related to whether or not a data scientist could produce quality work additionally im not bound by some larger data scientist ethical code if i can put myself in a better position by using new softwares then thats what im gonna do im not the one that decided to pay me to do this work its not my problem that they dont have a grasp on the situation,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZW1MY0xGanZLTzhSNDQ2MUNLQm92NUNHLUYzcVpCdkdfN1NWWWxjb195NEFrOUZGV2FabGN1RENoNnlyS1p6RExvb3BWTGZpOHBuT2hwbDJlajBTOUE9PQ==

this ive been working in a very conservative domain where datascience is a forbidden word when we had a look at how they did their analytics currently and i proposed a few very simple solutions to the problems they had they became quickly fans we tend to think big but most of the time the actual solution is very simple and that really builds trust,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvam4tVE1wOVFzam5qcmpzZ2l4Mk1qUlNDQkVEVDFHWDg4TWVYc0xqWC0yMjgzTDUyRVBrZUEtMTltUXZtVk1pdVNpVThrM0lJWUtvbmZoQ3NqMFVDeHZGWGFDNnBmbi1BUUVETnBnai1yem89

it takes time and trust building and theres frankly no way around that as far as them making insane demands that you will never be able to deliver this is partially down to the temperment of the stakeholder in question and you can never fully eliminate it what you can do is engage with them and make it clear that what you need to understand is their pain point not what they believe will solve their pain point a lot of people resist this initially but try to be honest and say that its not always possible to produce a useful model of something for any number of reaons ultimately it all comes data availabilityquality but try to give more proximate causes as appropriate but there may be other ways to address the problem especially because alternatives might be faster or easier to deliver for building trust in your models at least in traditional industry ive found that people tend to trust people much more than they trust models though this may change as the older generations eventually retire in general ive found that its best to engage with your stakeholders early and often and again always try to get face time or video call time with the person with the problem not their boss or the person who directly asked you ask to shadow them to understand their painpoints and how this thing theyre asking you to predict fits into their workflow if you get pushback make it clear that this has a number of benefits <number> potentially identifying faster and easier ways to address their problem no executive can resist the allure of a quick win <number> understanding the context of a prediction is important because a lot of superficially similar numbers can mean different things like what if it turns out that when they need a particular prediction you cant rely on feature x being available is the cost of misclassifying y equally bad for false positives as it is for false negatives do you care much more about your numerical prediciton being very wrong than slightly wrong or does it not really matter beyond a point also you need some basic background to detect bad data or to know how much it matters if you can explain the models results seriously context is everything <number> you can leverage their domain expertise this is often genuinely beneficial for modeling in feature selectionengineering because even if some of their heuristics arent actually right they often have a kernel of truth do not just go tell them that theyre wrong and they can save you a ton of time in eda by helping guide you to the most important relationships in the days of anns and automl this practically doesnt matter as much though it does still matter but i promise you that going through this exercise with dramatically increase your credibility with the person who has the problem basically to get people to listen to you you need to make sure they feel that youre listening to them do this at the level of the person experiencing the problem not executives if theyre on your side their bosses and their bosses bosses will be much more receptive to you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvbzdNbDZDQk9vM3gxUjVyZWlJSmZsTUhhU1d3cVFXRFdySS11MDhyYmpfcElRWUx5dUd1SmxsNzRSQnYxcXl2WERWWm1NUW9ISm9MNWNySWYtWExSbmc9PQ==

agree with matlab i used it at a company that sounds similar to what youre dealing with its very similar to pythonr and the team at mathworks actually does a pretty good job of maintaining the products and has a help line with someone you can talk to this was big for me since senior mgmt was also worried that with open source i could get stuck or we could have an issue and not have professional support the downside is that they require more payment for different packages so i would be very clear about what you need and see the cost of that vs just the baseline for example they had an econometrics package that seemed pretty good but my company wasnt willing to pay for it so i had to write some functions on my own,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJveWc2aHBULXdSYm9LZXNNZ25UOGtISzlockpCbW0xNG9nWHJOeDNFVmtxdjlGU2w3V3h1VDdGR1U2SnRBU3RIUVlqUXg3d1A2TXFmMmhHVURVV1ZibkhYYnNtUFV1SXB6Z0VOaFZ5NWlrRjg9

big fan of statistical rethinking by richard mcelreath theres a bit of remedial stats here as he introduces the frequentist approaches first but its a good read especially as someone not formally trained as a statistician i think bayesian use cases abound but it definitely depends on what type of data scientist you are i often report to people who barely grasp frequentist methods so its just rarely worth it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvUDJod19ZN2hIUkliN2FQWFhpY1dYVWhUNmVjN1htRWlJbW5WdkFXeXNESjB3Y3hqN1RhSkdJTFVYdWp1blFtd2lBeVVaYTRpeWl0a1BGWHRNVmhtekE9PQ==

if you can convince your management to go cloudbased thats really the better choice easier to manage costs more flexibility and more longterm potential for growth are all there and all not there with running your own infrastructure at the end of the day are you an infrastructure company are you a data company or are you a company that just needs to do things with data and has some other core concern if youre not an infra company dont waste your time building infra cloud companies have done it better than you ever possibly could and provide it to you at an incredibly low cost not to mention the industry is very focused on cloud so if you want to hire people in the future thats how they will expect to work youll have a hard time bringing in people to a environment that isnt cloudbased that said i know a couple people have mentioned infrastructureascode iac and specifically terraform i cant recommend iac enough its really the way to go instead of manually managing your servers and data resources you can just describe what you want with code and let the iac tooling do the work for you that said id suggest looking at pulumi not terraform the main reason for that is it sounds like youre a small team and are primarily data scientists so youre probably comfortable working with python with terraform youd need to learn a whole new language to use it its called hcl and its kind of awkwardconfusing with pulumi you can just write in python that means you can reuse your existing skillset instead of trying to learn new skills and also being stuck being the only person at the company who knows how to work with the infrastructure because youre the only one who knows hcl ask me how i know lol full disclosure i care about this problem so much that i now work for pulumi and i advocate for it whenever i can because i genuinely think its a better approach iac is cool terraform is cool but pulumi is a nextgen product vs tf and was created with the benefit of hindsight no shade on what tf has accomplished but pulumi just does it bettereasier,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvNlpVLVJacXdfSG5BZ0tYeVZmNFp0eW9fM1JIbkduNV96TklCS2Zhb1NWWm5oWE1qSlljNWExVUpMUGlBeUlpSzQzZkxLbmJZenZHdmxacjZqV2Rmdnc9PQ==

i have found more niche communities more helpful and responsive and lack of a good community for python if you come from or background you probably do some optimisation then julia jumpjl is a good example how many optimisation packages collected under one interface also i found julia community quite welcoming because it is smaller but that is another programming language and not an immediate thing to learn earlier ago stackoverflow was decent some help may come from rlearnpython especially if your question is well specified a lot is just reading the documentation and now you have chatgpt copilot codellama for help community is nice to have but it just may not exist as python skill is becoming generic and people move fast pass the learning phase last untrivial thing is hiring someone to fix a specific task when you are really stuck in edge case and gives an extra skill in explaining your task and negotiation does cost money also better and worse cases essential to keep the focus on a specific task,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwUHJnTVczVno2Yi1icGk2dHN4djVIVFpiQ1pTYnZaamgzd0lhaEJHNWJqWFp3bWl4WkxHVmRUWmpvclVwV28xd0hMNTltZTJKOWk0MVVkb2lYSU5KaHc9PQ==

funnily enough me and my boss were having this chat i did an experimental phd and almost never do experiments in my role it is almost entirely observational correlational analysis and he is a software dev by training so while he did stats his day to day is building llms because of the ai hype if i get lucky i get to do some attributional modelling or forms of ab testing but it isnt often clients are ready for that and im a consultant actual real experimental ds work is very rare and even amongst other dss that i work with most are just making dashboards on sales reporting metrics which is not science and the others have just been around for a while but never did lab work lots of folks did some analyst job once last five years and auto promoted to ds when it got popular because the company didnt want to not have one it is a weird industry because i meet data scientists who are just doing google analytics reports and others who are making new software applications and others who are doing actual ab testing and causal modelling so lots of range and yet everyone has the same title,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwN2s0LTFQUW96VGtXZ3ppUmY0OUpoRXNrN2diWDFwNTc1QXoyYVpwZmVmcEtSS3JWbHd0RVRLZnNfNTdtMk1vSWhOc2lZb09CRmhDQkZMRmVMbXNLQ3c9PQ==

i think chatgpt is by far the best option for this if you are currently taking a coursera and understand the basics of programming chatgpt should be perfect i think for people who have no background chatgpt is sometimes mostly a cheating tool rather than a help me learn tool but that doesnt sound like you just make sure youre using chatgpt to understand the concepts and not write all of the code for you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwVFdvcno1bDNWNE5RX2JSajh2RF9EMGtzVWF4UENZdVBkUkoteWMwc3hfb3l6aFNHaUUzck03b2hVWVk4Mkk3OHJYU29ScmhDNDJobzluRzRnTzViLS1jUlVOUGNBREFBR1E0bnM4SlFGbGc9

makes sense yeah dash was a little bit confusing for me to learn too because its almost a combination of two programming languages you are writing what looks super close to html but youre actually writing python code if you were able to figure that out though then you are going to be just fine learning programming takes practice and the right mentality and you clearly have both,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwdk5YaHlNTmhIYkdZZF9OQzd2QkFyXzZrekZyQ2RiYjFxSHFpOE1XbFYxXzRfZFozajJhcGpSdEVLdTA1LUZxVnAySmNlelFQWkwtaHAzX1UwTDJHazFSb202ZEYxZmwwNFVXOV9EZ0hSb1E9

id say it would depend on the amount of na values you have in the column if you are arguing that the columns data is valuable however it does not positively contribute to the accuracy of the model with its overwhelming amount of na then theres no reason to keep it if you keep na in your model lets say you are doing a onehotencoding method the method will treat the na as its own separate valuewhich no one wants imputing the data will eliminate this the general rule of thumb though is to impute when you have at least <number> non null in column,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2N1B4S3ltNmQxUFl4UGlCVkFoRy1kT0VjN1lhbThLdlU0OGlCcXRCcmpUdG9teDh5RlFMNG9ZVkpSamh6bWk3cTcxUnlpdlNBZ2xGMk9FQ0s0aU9fdEE9PQ==

hi everyone im a data scientist with <number><number> years of experience at a consulting firm primarily working with transactional and financial data for manufacturers wholesalers distributors etc i have a masters in applied statistics and strong technical skills from a pythondata science boot camp however i often struggle to connect my statisticalmlai expertise to business problems and solutions due to what i think is a lack of business knowledge my manager is supportive of me pursuing an online mba and my company will cover the costs to me the mba wouldnt be the top item on my resume but rather complimentary to my experience working in industry ive heard oh youll pick up this or that with experience and maybe im still so new but i feel after nearly three years i should feel more confident in identifying business problems and prescribing solutions im looking for insights from those who have been in a similar position have you pursued an mba after starting your career as a data scientist or considered it how did it impact your ability to understand and solve business problems do you think it was worth it was it worth the investment in time and effort any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated thanks,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TE1FWHpNbnNQazh5Y1ZHNFVRaUtYVHM3OHZvWDQ5Zl9CZ1RxLWJpY0l3NkR3QlJ4MlNDRWd6RkJXUFlHYXI5Zmx5N2pKcmE0M3dpM3RUTTl2Z1VsZWFBelpNUVlVT2dvYnlZZG1OdGdjc0k9
give transparent and wellreasoned level of effort estimates that end up being accurate over time if its a shitty boss that just fails to plan keep their team informed on what information youll need in the future id probably look to leave the team if the leads do a good job of making sure you understand the broader objectives it might be worth reevaluating if the right projects are being prioritized ideally you want to be in a good position to answer priority questions because you anticipated them,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RWxzYl9VRllxTTN3cXlPN3BzZzFVekw5ZDUxUWtObGx6a2xEb1lGc0owdjJHTlVOYWIzSmhjMVhaWWVrT25kbXVHMEVBdlAzT0l6SWItZjJadkZuS20xSWV0dTBtUmRTX2I1VzN4b2U3T0U9
i bet that this issue is a result of misaligned expectations now you may not have control over your bosss expectations but you can influence it to some degree for example ask them to provide more details about their ask you can then estimate the time needed to complete each task and ask them if they agree with your estimates also be ready to justify your estimates bosses who just say just do it probably lack enough data to provide a reasonable estimate and that means that there is room for negotiation unless they are totally unreasonable if you come prepared with your estimates you should be able to influence their expectations good luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2VS1zdHV3ekc3M2F4UElNTDhMUGcxclNWYzdHai1UWmc1X3pUVUF4VnVSQlNIbzM2YTJJZ1A0aVJKeFpKTFBaamFsYmZROGJfUTQyamtZRHViSldlemc9PQ==

to be honest unless your work experience is truly exceptional and you can bring something that cant be found in the country youre seeking work in your chances will be slim to none your best bet will be to find local offices for the tech companies you want to work for and start there that or sometimes these companies have international joint ventures or business partnerships with companies that may be local to you and that can also be a good place to look be realistic in setting expectations and know that with technological innovations you may honestly be better off trying to start your own business locally and selling to people abroad success there could legitimately attract the attention of the tech companies youre seeking to work with,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2S3NLWnAzZTFtdWhZUTlmd3g4LXpjOGp2TVFuNzVfRzN2OElOWVRxVFpLc3pmTlViZVdwV3ZfZ0VXZVpjWVlPM091WkMtQnJZVmMwOHpvMHZ2YTloYlE9PQ==

ah ok also do machine learning models find it useful when for example there is this one row of data and in that row there is one column that has an na while all the other columns have a value would the machine learning models still be able to capture the data from rest of the columns even with that one na column thats what im kinda thinking about like i have <number> nas for this one column out of <number> rows so i dont want to impute but was wondering if keeping it would help the model capture the values stored in the other columns of the corresponding row where these <number> nas are present for one column and this seems to be an important column so i would like it to learn from the remaining values that are not na thats why i dont want to remove this column,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2V3FMWTVsYUNub3NPZGVBd0F6Y1FGOEJwdTVNVE9QelhDdUFvNVQ1UG4zTzYyeFdUQ1lKcHE1TnNVNklzaVdtRjA3UlpOX0hwSDBYNWItR25oeGNLbXc9PQ==

i can give you advice but i cant promise it will work break down your work into subtasks and provide hours estimates log your time stick to your guns use version control systems remote repositories kanban boards etc these tools create a paper trail of your work beyond endless email threads and help to cya they will neutralize the ability for a reasonable colleague to blame you for misunderstandings document as much as you can if your manager refuses to manage then you should devote more hours per week to managing document that too establish a community of practice for the domains you work in or contribute to an existing one ask for support from your peers,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2clR1YmhVY215RkpHanZEc3BwVFRxNHkxVk1lVVNXWkhPN1ozNnd6NkRwbmdiZ0FXM1QzWXRCQVdkYTc2RDhseGFaSlRQOFJuSjRlcHMzNzdBa2dfWUE9PQ==

first of all your boss is a devils advocate trying to pick a fight very unprofessional completely my personal opinion well if i were you i would talk with the hr and complain about this unprofessionalism behavior of your manager assuming your response you might have already tried this option ahead then other option i prefer would be to reduce productive proficiency as your organization seems to be unworthy of your full productive capabilities and prepare to move to better organization i mean what kind of organization allows an underqualified person to take incharge who cant even perform a first thing mention in his job description and be okey with an unrealistic expectation a jerk is a jerk i dare say politely moderator remember you are not bound by their rules you have the skill you offer they can only offer you a price but the value you set for yourself is wholly up to you try finding someone who respects your valueskill,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Rmc0blRYbGlzODkzTnlFTUlRTFFGRDRxRFlSeW1rYndTWnZ5Q2ZuM214TzNKVmVwVHk0WHVyX2hHa2RBa3F2djRUaHZzb0tTTVVvckdmdy1MYmsxVHc9PQ==

its an error to try and make people do anything especially when the power differential isnt in your favor consider your options can you easily find another job thats an option secure another income source and bounce another option is to just do it and not get personally invested in have quality output another way might be to be act like a yesman to your bosses face and then when its time to work you do what you think is right just fullon dissonance between what you say and do you could also poop on your bosss desk youve got an array of options but ultimately you only control yourself,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2R3RVSmpRY0o1a1VFOERFdzZremthWktLRVMwbnBDMFBuNlJwcXVEWDQxcWVMQlFJOENpY0ZCaUZpZ1lwN3RaMjdySXJaZEtlSzAzald6RXBaM2JnWWc9PQ==

i should start by saying i am a power bi specialist at my company ive had a bit of an unconventional route to get to this point so i have minimal experience in codingdata management we are in the process of switching one of our safety tools from one that has a very straight forward integration with power bi to one that does not typically our it department provides financial data to me through snowflake while i go directly through the safety tool to get safety data so our it department is not going to provide this safety data through snowflake i figured i could try and build my own tables in snowflake but as mentioned my coding experience is limited i have at least a basic understanding of sql but i have never used python before my understanding is if i want to pull data from this new tools api i would use python to make requests to the api and pull data and sql to query it organize it and make tables to pull into power bi and create reports is this correct would anyone be able to expand on the relationship between to two ive be trying to find the correct training and just want some more information before i purchase a less than helpful class should also mention ive been able to make requests through postman to this new tools api as well just not sure how these all cooperate together,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2SGRXanFlUDhKYzRJUVFjM2pDWTVQU3Q1c2FXM0ctOWdYc2JXanFOZHVJdC1TLThKZ296RGd6ZkVoVTJRZ1NidXgwdHBub2pmRUtnREhubVozSk1LS0E9PQ==

ive seen many different things online saying that being a data scientist is really just learning to code mostly python and sql and gathering the mess of data and trying to make it make sense which im interested in but ive seen a lot of other posts mentioning that calculus and linear algebra are required for data science and i have never been very good at advanced math like calculus i can understand a bit of statistics but i dont understand terms like matrices gradient descents and things like that also im thinking of joining an <number> month data science bootcamp that will teach everything from scratch but im worried that if im not naturally inclined to high level math then i will not perform well in the bootcamp or in a data science career so im wondering if you have to absolutely be a natural math genius to have a successful career as a data scientist or if it is something that can be easily learned and you only need a general knowledge of calculus and things like that any help is greatly appreciated,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2cDRnY3VqZHNEOUpockFJSmUzVlBEYUlMN0JTSVQzUk1JaF9IZmFlM3h0REMyVHhJX1dWaUVwVFJqcW4zaWtRSjg0VXk1ZU1yYlg0RzRqWWRFc201Y1E9PQ==

i think a lot of this depends on your network the pay youre happy to accept and the school you currently attend if youre at a school like cal and youve got good internships on your resume already you can land a job as a swe on a research team doing dsmly work at faang especially because of your math background to working in a research role at a lower paying possibly private companyschoolgovernment role this latter one may also depend on the country and field also plenty of people intern in industry during their phd and go straight into industry,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2aklyRnlsbW9QUndqMWptUzZEVGw3OTBqOFpwVm9NME5pU2dENy1qbUEyMURCX09LZlBOSEx1U3gwZlNrSkxPQklKNzJwUGhfTTlhd3VLa3ZuQ3FfTXdGNVAwNWtqWjNobG9OaUQxbEtUblk9

from my perspective you havent provided enough contextual information for anyone here to give you legitimately useful actionable advice which prompts the following observationproposition what if your boss simply hasnt been provided with enough information clearly its much more difficult to calibrate your expectations when you dont have all the information about whats being done or why and on a related note i always start from the assumption that conflicts with colleagues in my own life are matters of ignorance misinformation not malice ill intention so if you feel like your boss is treating you like a chat bot that shits out codeoutcome in seconds then either your boss doesnt give a shit about you ie company culture is the problem or your boss simply doesnt understand appreciate the technical nuance of your work the solution is always communicate,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2anljWnMtV2cyVWVReFczWkMtRkVoWmxFNmJ3aXM2blJYVWFGNTFyMlZ4dEx2R21LWlUyZWlvNGYzVko3bkdFQUhpMHFuZGxqejl1bDhJNllXYkNUbmc9PQ==

you definitely do not need to be a mathematics genius to be a data scientist you do have to be willing to sit down and struggle with mathematics a little bit in the goal of getting a bit better at it statistics at the college level is more math heavy and can be math heavy depending on the job however not every data scientist job is extremely math heavy some require just some basic algebra and stats at most even during times where you need more robust mathematics you can always consult with colleagues use textbooks etc also do you have a college degree in a field such as computer science statistics mathematics economicsquantitative social science if you dont then a data science bootcamp is probably not going to immediately get you a data scientist job maybe a data analyst job though though even that depends on your local job market youll be competing with people with relevant degrees and experience it is a good start to learn some things though about data science,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RzZuU3NpbFg2dDVwenB1eHNoQXJudGpTbE5nTGVHWGR4ekxraVRXSTJVZUxRMkY4dzZLcDZjSkw1Ylg3N0EtaWJhYmNTNlcxSS1LWUdIaHpqTnhYWlE9PQ==

ive worked extensively with largescale restaurant data and faced similar challenges using nlp techniques like tokenization and named entity recognition can help standardize idiosyncratic notes and inconsistent item names libraries such as spacy and nltk are excellent for this for data cleaning tools like openrefine can be invaluable for standardizing inconsistent entries to address the heterogeneity in order timing conducting time series analysis with tools like pandas and prophet can uncover patterns related to timeofday and seasonality once the data is cleaned applying machine learning algorithms can effectively classify items if you need more specific advice feel free to ask me,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bHdzT3VyRHBxUXlqQldkeEFDUjlNa25RbHZ2Y0Z1T09lY2NFbEtjZGpvM0h4eFF6VXZtaGNwb3N2Wk9OQUFNdUwtQzZfckJrWE5Wd004Z0M1eUplY2c9PQ==

like a star trek engineer the time expectation stated should have a decent pad built in for any issues that come up because something usually will this sounds deceptive but its not your stated turnaround time is like a promise and your manager will have other people lined up for the next stage of work around that time so the best thing is to set a generous time but then absolutely meet it hell or high water under promise and overdeliver this lowers everyones stress and is good for the business its also correct to be transparent with your boss that this is how youre doing it if theyre really in a crunch they can go captain kirk on you edit to add it might be worth introspection to see if you actually need to speed up your skills i say that only because i am currently thinking through what tasks i need to practice and hone so that i dont have to spend too much time on them when called upon,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Z2F0blM3YUgwTmxwZS13MElmQ3Rwb3lJSWowTUdhSGFoNG1mZzktUk5lNXJrNFhZck02QmVndDR0VFBSX1BQRW9IVmtMQ0U3a19Jdk5zR2s1dU5od3c9PQ==

ive been around a while and ive concluded that the just do it mindset isnt an issue of understanding problem solving and solution execution processes this is an issue of personality and power dynamics they dont care about reasons they actually dont even care about outcomes or timeframes all they care about is whether they believe that youve done the best job as fast as possible they will never understand because theyre not looking to be educated you have to make them believe this isnt a logic problem or a project problem its a sales problem its a persuasion problem a shitty boss with this approach has two ways to get there they either need to see you be constantly berated and defeated to the point theyre satisfied that youre at breaking point and beating you wont make you row faster or they need someone to push back so hard that they believe youre at breaking point and fed up with their bullshit start small try a grumpy persona look jerry i need to analyse the problem solve the damned problem document it write the code test it make sure it doesnt fuck up anything else put it into source control get jenny to peer review it schedule the change make the change test the goddamn change and then update all the manuals because thats how professionals work if we want to just half arse it and you want to skip some steps send me an email otherwise i need you to push back on the customers and let them know that if they want quality then it takes some time the problem isnt just that the boss is shitty its that they have people pushing on them who know even less than they do and because they dont really know the work involved they push down instead of pushing back,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2czdLWnVWay1WWW1jZDR2QnVyTUNlQzlUUXRYNXpObmxVSldsc3NMX29SbEJkNGx1OFNScTdLcEdfeEZBNVlLbE1fUzR0c0xTSmVpQThZWjIxRU40RUE9PQ==
youre calling me a snowflake on an anonymous professional forum you must be so much tougher than me sarcasm all jokes aside do you not see the irony of immediately calling me names when i say something that you dont like wouldnt that by your own definition make you obnoxious and a snowflake you couldve refuted my argument yet you immediately result to insulting me through ad hominem the most trivial form of argument i did not say that he does not have the right to think he has a nice accent though how would any of us be able to tell if he has a nice accent over written text i am saying that he is being disrespectful by bringing up asians and other peoples accents as if that makes him better than other job applicants for one it literally does not matter what accent you have when you work in data science people care about your ability to do math stats computer science and to communicate that information succinctly you can communicate succinctly with any accent imaginable and i am not the only one on this subreddit who thinks any of the above so if you think you are right actually refute some arguments and go after them maybe make another post if you think you are so right and the rest of the subreddit is wrong if i were hiring at the moment and he brings up any of this in an interview he would be immediately removed from the application process,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bmpraVk1MFBmb1haZ3Y2bXV2Z2tCMGlwVmhhT1VVUWRZWUdDclFiZUlRZzF3elNTQ3hSbjhRLWF4Z1BGNzhXc1lXOTZ0VkhKa2c2b1I0S1JEU1JUcnc9PQ==

i was a contractor at some different agencies than the ones you mentioned and i wont say much more than that but theres a huge difference in the types of jobs you can pull based on whether you have a secret or a tssci clearance the latter will be tremendously helpful if you want the flexibility to transfer to other positions yes i think you could ping pong between different jobs as long as you dont burn bridges and you keep your skills sharp the combination of federal contractor + qualified data scientist is quite niche and i have seen full time recruiters work hard to hire talent for empty positions for months to no avail cant comment on those agencies in particular but i did not enjoy my time working as a contractor i faced the same problems data scientists always face with the added pressure that my colleagues were mostly neurotic and treated every little thing as a matter of national security i cant say it wasnt stressful i will say it was an exciting way to start my career and i actually dont regret it i was paid well i got to work on some interesting problems however the data science that happens in the federal contracting space is different from corporate data science as you probably wont be doing sql queries on a database of sales transactions and there are seriously federal data scientists who are hired for positions where no data really exists because an executive living in another state wanted to make their suite of agencies seem more cutting edge on paper if i were you i would schedule a follow up interview and ask more questions about the type of work they do the environment how your performance will be judged opportunities for advancement and the data and technologies they work with another factor maryland puts you closer to dc the epicenter of federal contracting jobs if youre young you may also just want to pick the job that pays better since youre at the buildingwealth stage of life,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2emcxTnYyRlJJeGlIQmlFMTJ3ZTVwZ3FqMncxM3owUkhIZFl5Y2w4bVVtalNxQk9GcmNUUVhWSEhNY3owdVdrM2p0RmNyaWp3bVNHZEx0MC1rVDhXYnc9PQ==

if there is anything i have learned in my long work life it is not just what you do but where you do it many years ago i was working on a team in a fortune <number> firm where my brain was being taxed daily with complex tasks that stretched me and yet i was in despair the company was a good one so i did not want to depart and instead looked for other roles and found one via networking to death in my new role my brain was being taxed daily with complex tasks that stretched me and i was in heaven same company different departments in department <number> i was working for a boss who did not fight for me or appreciate me on a team where i was odd man out and which had odd incomprehensible dynamics in department <number> i was working for a boss who fought for and appreciated me where i fit the team like a glove and the dynamics of the team were client centric so before you walk away completely work hard to land laterally in a different place and then see how you feel to get anywhere in data science takes work and you dont want to jeopardize all youve accomplished keep the faith,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2dWVvc3NiSm5KUTBNaFFuRWZmR3NpLWRGRnJrZFlQYTlYSlNMelE1WGdGX3BKOXBDa2lkYXExSlg5QzdhSzVLZEJDR3VvX2xielVic2c2dEdUSXFjemc9PQ==

what i have learned is that it is not the work that burns me out its the leadership and colleagues if even <number> is outstandingly bad it can really be crushing the work is a constant and it is often full of ups and downs well mostly downs until you figure it out get the great insight etc otherwise its a lot of failures to get there so if you have an outstandingly bad colleague or leader it just compounds those days of trial and error x so if you are feeling burned out check if it is the environment too those bad colleagues try to figure out how to not let them add to the work burn out decide if they have any value in what they say if not have the inner confidence to move past it im still working on it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2MHZ5SFNkcGJQTDNxQzRWZVhCRl9FWFdWYnlUcENLVVBDdXg2bXZPVWRzbTNRY0pER3hIYlR0ZnZhZ1J0eGdEVlJVLUFiVjdmZl8xT0w4UmoySHAzcHc9PQ==

nice visuals as the other person mentioned but i found the actual explanation after the teacup story overall confusing and overly compexverbose the teacup analogy on the other hand was very clear like are we saying the drug can only be effective if it decreased the average time by more than the <number> days go out of the <number> it would seem thats its impossible to have any improvement unless it was <number> days or more we would ignore all improvements of <number> <number> or <number> days then maybe i guess we can say that on each individual result ie this person lowered days to <number> but thats not enough to say it was significant but if youre talking about <number> individuals wouldnt the probability be cumulative and thus probably goes beyond the <number> confidence i get youre an author and for sure know more about it than i do but maybe were glancing over things that are obvious to you but not to average people like the sample size or what does the average mean on the study if the <number> days average comes from <number> results at <number> days and <number> with <number> for example anyway i really like the visual format and the <number> to <number> minute length videos so hoping to watch more,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2M2k4Q2NKVWhsVFd4QldrdzN3cjFZNURhR2x5TjdNbUFWbzBmWktMRjdZNFE4WURKOHBOaVdRcGRfYlJLLTM1eDdCN3NlNS1xX0U3Nk9rcktpc0o1QVE9PQ==

side project can be a way but in my experience is just a temp workaround your job still takes most of your time and energy youll likely think about it and it will drive the mood down as well even though the side proj brought a short time of enlightment it does not solve the underlying issue whatever it is been there it can be a difficult path just dont give up and try things at the end youll find your spot,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Y1hYeEtVajJCaEt3d09NMlFOU2xNY3U1MDQ2UzV4QmxWc3pIX2ZkTEVQQUZnNjAtdTRVT2oxUzRyZFY0dXR0TFNZNnEwTVNGeVZkNnYxVWJacWNQb0E9PQ==
this isnt exactly an uncommon feeling especially in software engineering and its related disciplines moving jobs teams can certainly help but over the long run this isnt really a solution do you see yourself moving every couple of years whilst in your s s s etc its not really sustainable in my s i moved a lot in my s not so much in my opinion the best thing to do for long term sustainability is to evolve a fulfilling life outside of work and just use work as a vector to enable this there are worse situations out there than being in a stale job where you are not overworked,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2VXRGVHFzNFFTNFVMM25BSFdrZ1JjZlYyNV96eFRpQ3RzS0x4Y2U4ZUxMdGlKckRUTDZDSXhTRG9mWGRLem92TTZ2LTFheElfal9vT3BEMHUzS2xOdEE9PQ==
ive felt the same in the past <number> year first job experience burnt down as hell due to dogshit management i was like holy crap and this is just my first year of work ever also i am passioned about the things i do ai cv nlp used to love researching back in uni and that first job just led me to lose that light and it impacted every other aspect of my life i felt like i was stuck even though i had alternatives but my mind was scattered and i started going therapy a colleague of mine as well true story then i had a new opportunity took <number> month off felt recharged and began this new adventure fast forward one year i am still missing something should i go back to uni doing the things that i loved not that the environment is perfect never is but it makes me feel good even when things are hard maybe because i feel deeply connected to the end goal a thing that i dont have at work find your path but you gotta move on make your choice and embrace the risk otherwise you ll always feel stuck and may end up in some depressive spiral without even recognizing it use this time to understand the things that drive you off and take a path forward to find your next spot thatll likely wont have those,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2eTNyd2hFLVFoRGs4Q09rT2phd0M3bjF6THhXRW0wZmR0OEFXUzhWenRvVWlhVm9nUEpWSVZ0TS1aTmJGTXV0emN0czhpekpkMDFGWjJzbXpWRXF1cVE9PQ==

hi guys those of you who are either students or recent graduates and working as data analysts business analysts what are the top <number> most useful tools that you wish you would have learned at uni is it visualisation tools like tableau power bi or sql or stats tools regressions ttests other for context i teach the final course in business analytics within a msc program based in australia and would like to update it every semester to make sure the course is most useful for students we mostly use python throughout the course and theres a project as a final assessment im trying to see what skills techniques software people would find most useful in their future jobs thanks in advance for suggestions,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2ZkNRWVlxdEpGYnVLX0NveTBzSGQyY01xbS12enNJNFJ4Nk9pRTR0dlhwOU9IZDhnMUFPTnR6eVpyWllZNDNmdnliUUNidnU0bnF1SGR6Q1E3SUhrUFE9PQ==

part of this is because your boss probably doesnt know how to do it and probably will never be able to so hes somehow projecting his inadequacy feelings into your work compounded with knowing how much the company is paying you for something he can never do that also stokes some resentment issues it doesnt matter how much money and then there is fear of being replaced it wont matter what you explain itll be perceived as excuses not reasons youd better find a boss who also knows coding this way the job alignment and management will be much better and you will save yourself years of therapy money,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2SXhZdXI2eThvUThTZGg3MWRsMzZuZjZGMTFLUkdyMTd3THhoVUV4OGVzTzdlbVJ1a3FMQXhSODVXNmtqY2JpeU5rVFFtajMtR2VHQ080eVJENFpCVEE9PQ==

not sure what interviews those are whenever i got into the technical details of new models that arent broadly used yet i usually technically overtalked my interviewer and i could tell he had no interest in what i was saying its like your friend just read a paper of something that just came out and started talking to you about it im sure for research positions or mle with a phd these things come up but i wouldnt consider that industrial data science tbh what impresses people in industry is how your used a model to solve a problem it kinda starts and ends there your technical expertise matters to the extent it helps you solve the problem better,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RWY0LUtTdkRveDdiV08tTG10NURNRkpZWHF1TFl3NWc3SGRScjYySE0zcHgwZkdRQWhRQ0dacV9Hc1ZzaVh0LUtJR1poVHBaalRzUTlMUnY0eVdKRmc9PQ==

i dont know if this is your case but ill share my own experience i used to work for two companies and my job there was quite similar every day my task was to fetch data upon request and create dashboards before that i worked as a programmer and only transitioned to data analysis after three years so getting accustomed to metricskpis was challenging for me given the numerous questions about the reasons behind these metricskpis one thing that bothered me during that time was my lack of business knowledge which made me uncomfortable proposing changes based on data you know you cant propose things that others know for sure are not feasible even though i had a lot of such proposals in mind secondly there was a lack of guidance surprisingly both companies i worked for had only one data analyst position for the entire office my statistical knowledge was my saving grace despite lacking business knowledge however it still wasnt enough to make me comfortable in my position instead i always found it difficult to apply this knowledge in practice especially without any references from predecessors work the projects i proposed felt very risky you know when you apply a predictive model to a completely new dataset and realize that your results are nearly meaningless due to missing key features you realize that in such cases the only thing you can rely on is businessdomain knowledge meanwhile all i had was statistical knowledge statistical models and hypothesis tests and no business knowledge i didnt even know what margin meant as a result instead of doing things that i found interesting like designbuild statistical models and making datadriven proposals for over a year i only fetched data and created dashboard feeling like my job was more suited for a data engineer you know companies need to see your results and if you want to spend time researching for your career advancement youll get tasks in a somehow related but completely different area this is especially true when you dont have the experience to clearly define your job scope and the company isnt entirely ready for that position but relies on your experience it was my case my experience in development helped me stay there a bit longer until i felt i couldnt learn much more ultimately i made my decision and proposed to my superior that i would work parttime and spend the remaining time on research i believed that this would balance my current work and my future career however the result was not as expected and i didnt get approval from my superior i left the company and continued my research up to now i focused on what i do best and traded a boring job for it the important thing is that i still know who i am and my inclination instead of just having it nominally while completely changing the nature of my work you might wonder what my research is that made me make such a decision people often say that to do well in data analysis you need two things statistical knowledge and domain knowledge however for me this is not entirely true the important thing in data analysis is to extract domain knowledge from the data using statistical knowledge and sometimes change existing preconceptions by observing the data itself you can categorize user groups using existing domain experience but when doing data analysis you have to temporarily set that experience aside to reframe the problem based on the data and do so more sharply than your previous experience using statistical tools my work after leaving the company entirely focused on this and sometimes i found it challenging but never felt burned out recently i initiated a challenge inspired by my observations on data analysis which you can check out here kaggle discussion<url> and discuss it maybe youll see yourself in it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bTdmbERLcGRjS2RHQ3o2VFNRelg0cGt5VXJwSVF6OGVqRDRSQzRzUnczTEpuUlpMT1QxRWhNTG5NczREOVlZOTZYc2M3b25OUjZEeG1NOWxpd3BLaUhrYVZuYkkxQjJkME9TQkVFR2ZROU09

not sure what impute mean here <number> replace na with some value or <number> remove na rowcolumn if it is <number> then i dont agree with this view there is no reason to remove datainformation if the na is not missing at random and the natarget is correlated then any imputing will reduce the model performance if na is missing at random then include that feature does not increase nor decrease model performance hence no drawback for example a person with missing credit rating may have higher default rate than an average person there are some machine learning models already have na treatment builtin such as catboost which treats na as either max or min value which retain those information,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Z0NLN1Q3bFdFMlB6dkZ4MlhxWExkS1BIVFJKU2J5RGoweTdFbHg3YjYxQ1U4WmNhWUxiNlg0b3BMLVJlVWdfSG44aUdBbmpkckR6cFlrSktCSTNrYUE9PQ==

i am usually a very disorganized person and i have previously felt in the problem of what was this code for after a couple of months without using it for me its a way to solve this problem also the idea of the company is that if this innovation project works fine they want to offer it to other companies this is lets say a pilot project as you can imagine sometimes things work fine but most of the times we encounter different problems that takes us time until we figure out the solution right now what im doing is to give a general overview of the project descript the different steps point out problemstasks and our suggested solutions and also indicating which codedocuments we used for each of the steps of course this does not mean that we dont need to reread and reinterpretate the code in a future iteration of the project but i think this will save some time for me or for anyone interested on this finally for me is something i like to do because i would like that if i enter a future project there was some documentation of why things were done like this and how where things done in general,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Y2Rnb2tMSWNodlcxUERNMXZObHp6TzNmb291OURqZjZsZnpROTFpeGVRVlV3MXZpNHprNzZJZnJyWl95Mk9VYy1RS0xpY0VOaG9WYmhDdTZXNk91T3U3NFE3Q1owaHBkdE91V2dfV192bk09

you know i have been hearing this generic answer to many questions lately thats not how the world works thats not how corporations work even if you do decide to change boss the boss do not roam around with their communication stats on their heads like video games you will still be taking a leap of faith even if one such boss exists they should also be willing to hire you even if they are willing to hire you they should have the budgetary approvals even if they do have the budgetary approvals other parameters should be a match from both sides even if you do end up getting hired the boss attitude or expectations can change over time even worse the boss themselves can be replaced by someone else in corporate restructuring remember your contract is with the org not the boss this flippant answer sounds like a generic copy paste from the nutcases over at antiwork who revel in instigating others to resign which works from them because most of the issues highlighted there are actually from entry level jobs which are aplenty data science is a niche area data scientists are a rarer breed problem is data science in and itself is not a very marketable product it will always be used to support some business activity or other activity that is tied with financial goals and the people managing those activities rarely have a technical background most of their exposure to data science would stem from hollywood movies and tv shows my suggestion set some time apart with them to walk them through what is it that actually happens when a data scientist tries to service a request share with them your requirements that make your job easier and set expectations in advance reinforce it by following the set procedures it will be a difficult journey but the rewards will be worth it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2OU4wOHpWajlQZG51d2NleTEzamNZcWI4d1dHLUlfbTVOYkRnanBKd2F3c19neWJKTXNadEZIVEtGWjk1WXFzVlVwUWhrakRQYnk0N3NVQWlfelFBbmpEeHlIZFpaMkUwWjk4akJmZTZfZ1U9

i hit a deep low couple years ago during grad school as i was starting my second job echoing some others here i have to see the value in the work to be motivated by it working in tech the past couple years i switched more to building internal tools for my team because i at least cared about them and not the click rates i blurred the lines between work and personal at my first job because it was something i was truly interested in this lead to <number> hour weeks and of course feeling under appreciated i took some time off of everything whole summer i didnt try to learn or do anything technical now im at a better balance job and company i enjoy took a pay cut to get out of tech i have bursts where i get really interested in something and then just lean into it and dive into a project then try to take time to do something else but yeah burnout happens it doesnt have to be the end of everything take care of yourself,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UWM2MTNfaVE2U0NvSkpHUTV0TDNHa3hjcExfZWVwNUFYRjNxMWRETjZ5dGxhUEZGcUZBZmkyNnlCeDJsRlNzOTdxaHZrdWNoc2N3R21zRWtwUWx0S2c9PQ==

>you know i have been hearing this generic answer to many questions lately thats not how the world works thats not how corporations work that is exactly how the world works if you dont like your job and you cannot change the things you dont like about your job you should look for another job no one is implying its easy the implication is that as hard as it is to find another job especially one with a better boss trying to from the bottom up change a bad manager into a good one is even harder some would argue literally impossible unless you have blackmail material on that boss >even if you do decide to change boss the boss do not roam around with their communication stats on their heads like video games you will still be taking a leap of faith and thats why you might need to do it multiple times this is no different than dating you dont just marry the first person you date because its scary to take a leap of faith entering the dating pool again yes the dating and job pools are cess pools but if you know that your current job makes you unhappy you have to keep taking shots out there and probably filtering better upfront especially since as you gain experience you also gain leverage in interviews to get more info about the companys cutlure approach etc >even if one such boss exists a boss with decent communication skills yes they do exist not that rare great bosses are rare but decent competent bosses arent > they should also be willing to hire you even if they are willing to hire you they should have the budgetary approvals even if they do have the budgetary approvals other parameters should be a match from both sides this is deliberately trying to make opening a job requisition seem complicated its not tons of companies are hiring and always will be >even if you do end up getting hired the boss attitude or expectations can change over time even worse the boss themselves can be replaced by someone else in corporate restructuring dope and if either of those changes results in shittier work conditions you should look for other jobs >remember your contract is with the org not the boss for the us at least your contract is with no one thats the beauty of atwill employment if your job wants to keep you both your boss your skip level boss the whole org hr and everyone else around you need to make it to where you want to work there if any of those factors make your work experience bad you can leave i cannot emphasize this enough you dont owe your company shit other than doing your job in exchange for money >this flippant answer sounds like a generic copy paste from the nutcases over at antiwork who revel in instigating others to resign which works from them because most of the issues highlighted there are actually from entry level jobs which are aplenty this type of mentality is what keeps all levels of workers from realizing they are all equally taken advantage of by companies >data science is a niche area no >data scientists are a rarer breed no >problem is data science in and itself is not a very marketable product no >it will always be used to support some business activity or other i guess depending on your definition of business activity although there is rd >activity that is tied with financial goals sure activities have financial goals >and the people managing those activities rarely have a technical background no >most of their exposure to data science would stem from hollywood movies and tv shows no >my suggestion set some time apart with them to walk them through what is it that actually happens when a data scientist tries to service a request the same person that mindlessly assigns you tasks with no concern for your workload is not normally a person that has any interest in being sat down and have something explained to them >share with them your requirements that make your job easier and set expectations in advance again the same person doesnt care to make your job easier >reinforce it by following the set procedures i guarantee there are no set procedures because the type of manager that has set procedures is not the type of manager that treats devs like chatgpt >it will be a difficult journey but the rewards will be worth it i can speak from direct experience here it is definitely a difficult journey and it is <number> not worth it i spent <number> years working for a company where nontechnical people led the data science team and it was a freaking nightmare and i worked hard to educate these people and set up processes and try to stick to reasonable timelines and everything you just suggested you know what happened my vp committed to deploying a poc we hadnt even finished in <number> weeks directly over christmas and new years eve break why because he wanted to look good in front of his boss and because he wasnt going to have to do jack shit for this project so he got to enjoy it while <number> of us spent <number> weeks working <number> hour weeks rolling out a nationwide program built on the shittiest technology stack you can conceive since then i have only worked for companies where i felt confident that we had either a senior enough ds leadership that i wouldnt have to worry about this ie at least two levels of more senior data scientists above me normally sr director and vp or a leadership team that could give me ample evidence of understanding that they would need to defer to me on data science topics and that has worked out greats for <number> jobs in a row now learn from my mistakes people dont change company culture doesnt

im not sure im understanding the post but it sounds your concern is the same person could be shown to the model multiple times this would be an autocorrelation issue how big of an issue it is depends most people dont seem to care about it at all in my experience but there are methods to deal with it the most common ones i use are multilevel modeling and you put random intercepts at the person level or using some kind of nn and you structurally build in the fact that youre modeling some of the same people over time,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2R1JfNlVuYVZsWUUtaXZQVDY4QTJFNndSREFCMzNyR0RRc1cxU2VRbnNBSVdWZWVpWVE3Sko2aTZMcDdrTGlVQW0wQUM4ZzNnRVVrV3ZTWVE1d1NTSFE9PQ==

oh yeah that can definitely cause autocorrelation issues i did a project like that recently actually though im in finance so it was using past payment activity and other time series predictors to predict future payment activity i used a time series lstm where each row it was a d dataset but using row colloquially of data was a customer time series comprised of all their past behavior each month making a payment or not which then predicted their next months behavior and then the model was trained on all those time series because the lstm is modeling the time series itself you account for the autocorrelation issue the model knows that its the same person and you shouldnt get any bias leaking to other people i think itd be a good solution in your case as well pretty complicated model though so depends on how much youre willing to bite off but if youre already doing computer vision could be an easy extension,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UmZFdU9HVi1EWHQ3X3BBTnJzeEg4UU5wa3BjSmtDWlg4TG9pN05zSXZDUzFFTmFjN01zSmdIWVVOWFpkc0xKWEpfclhpbGh4WmphaVRHTXp4cnZmcXc9PQ==

its definitely difficult especially if youre a manager to balance delivering outcomes with learning goals most of the new work that my team does generates limited value for the business either because the method is mismatched with the problem or we dont the expertise to use the method in the right way or our stakeholders are reluctant to try something new new ventures by their nature are uncertain for my part ive found reframing problems helpful if someone is trying to figure what set of product features to invest in you can answer that with descriptive inference what features are users using the most but if your team was curious to try something different you could also answer that with causal inference what features cause a user to do more of the action that you want the problem is the same but the methods you can use to answer the questions are different and might challenge you to learn new concepts we frequently do them both to derisk our new ventures,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QnZiVHhKTUtFcEE4ZGV6cTJTMTdsMXN4VEEzVVZvSnktc1ZndGk2bHRhOHpaZGNFSE55TDV5OU1HZDRVaWNUdHFmVjE4V3hxZGc0Y1RxY21iRDZUSm9HSHZxQ1lwZi1EWUJuRW9lWnBUUk09

if you are in a professional services industry like consulting they absolutely matter if someone has a certification in the same way someone has a relevant degree it is physical confirmation of their knowledge people can lie about their contribution to projects and experiences its harder to misrepresent certifications as they follow a curriculum of knowledge certifications demonstrate you have a fundamental understanding of how to use a technology university courses do not generally teach in azure or aws if you work with clients they will want you to be a subject matter expert it also shows a commitment to learning that is important tldr yes in professional services as it is a trusted way to check your knowledge,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TklNOVNEbDU3ZkhmamZUSUFYcXBiOUQ1N3hLd3VZa0h6cElEMXd2SWhLaHVqTXdNdWFRV2NkVGFuODd4VE9zVEJWX015Y2ZYdHlNczJNQUFXaW8xYVE9PQ==

i dont know what field youre working in but i think you should look for data similar to your previous work and reproduce your analysis using python packages thats the quickest way for you to showcase your analytical skills in a different language if you want to expand into pythonspecific capabilities you havent explored before web scraping is a decent example but not the only one instead you could try projects in big data like data analysis with pyspark nevertheless your analytical skills are still the most important and choosing data that can better demonstrate that will save you a lot of time in the transition unless you want to do something completely new then you should refer to existing projects with many reviews evaluating the scalability of these projects will also be simpler than starting a project from scratch,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ekdmWG92Tk9qLVJEejBkeEE1UTZlQ0J4bWNTN0Z2YnNfUXNOa0F2SXA4dmplbG4ycTEzRy14Z19CRUUwQWJZWVdqd2lOYjVzaG55LWI3NlhzZGNkb3B3TVdVTEk5TmhGLWFrNzZLeUtFOUk9

what worked for me was that i worked for a year at one team in big tech company which was boring same situation as you there was career growth though i then transferred to a more startupy team and that helped to get more motivated more interesting projects more ownership more stuff to learn and obviously more straighforward career growth you build important things you get raised the downside was that you also had to work harder after honey moon period though i still got a bit unmotivated since i was a new engineer on that team i would get smaller and more boring tasks and i would not care much to do them quickly enough and not do my best job basically so just changing the team was not enough for me to look forward to working everyday basically later i realized that best engineers also excel at those small boring tasks too earn more trust and get assigned bigger projects so changing teams worked but you also have to change your mindset and attitude as well ive also seen the problem of boring work solved by just continuing to do what people do but really have a great quality of life weekend trips getting food with friends each evening rock climbing and other things engineers like to do so its really about what you want i guess i personally feel like the more interesting way to go about it is to really be excited about your job career,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bmJrMFpidmRMd1VyNFJPcUJTTHozQllZQ2VKZ1VUVTk4WEZ4TW16cmg1aGhTVzN2bXJjYVV1M2ZzbHpMWHlqRFQ3VHlzNnhiNXV6ZkR1aC1vMy1UM1FGLVNjZ0Uya2hQdXpMOHh3NVVpM2c9

hi everyone im doing a bit of a career change at the moment and am interested in going into the field of data science my local college is offering up a data science as degree that im planning on starting this fall but i wanted some kind of experience before i start i dont have much experience with machine learning and am kinda overwhelmed with all the options for online courses and bootcamps many of them are too long ranging from <number><number> months and ive also heard some of them can be a ripoff if you dont know what youre looking for i just want to have some sort of proper introduction to ds before i start classes so that i can be more comfortable working with the material any and all guidance is appreciated <<number>,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MXpXbF90WVJhNEJ5UV9oNU4xQjZBaElDZUJEQndYMkFwWUxOV0ZqeVFsQ1BWdjY2Z3ZiQ1Jpd1M0ZFV0UTNHQTlXYlgtd0hzc2VFZkhKaDFHdnljOUE9PQ==

theyre not original and theres a lot of resources you can copy from too no one would be impressed with a basic phone number app if you were in software dev the same is true of doing some work on the titanic dataset in data science and besides if its something you enjoy looking into rather than the typically done thing youre going to have better intuition about what to investigate and more passion when doing so in the first place personal projects above all should be personal to you imo,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UkFJWWd5Z1Z6OTQ1Nkd0WUluZ1dvMEJ2d0ZraXVxbkQ2RUxEMWx4TGNWYmJORFV1RDhkU0ZpZU8wXzE3bEFuNC14VWtRSm1XR0ZSRy1abThjMnI2MHc9PQ==

my husband was on a long term burnout till he took a long break a few months off work which is covered by insurance but not nearly as much as his full salary he focused on himself started going to see the physiotherapist nutritionist psychologist etc to fix everything wrong which has been going on for years but kept being neglected he is in a much better state now runs and exercises regularly does meditation and yoga regularly lost quite some weight got into much better shape has a much healthier mindset about himself and life in general became more patient and we have a much better relationship now strongly recommend it if you can afford to take a few months off the current job a short vacation is definitely not enough,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3RmN4ZS1oR2FRQ1FkLXlOb2lEZG5vVExtS3lmZTRGYzV6cUJHNWpWWDJDeUdJcjJrS0VCVFp4T19JWHZjTzVLblBERTIteHcwVm9oWkQ0Y2tSaklVelE9PQ==

i meant exactly the same definition youd find if you look up the term a platform engineer is a software engineer who builds and maintains platforms for developers to use to create and deploy applicationsthey are responsible for making operations smoother automating tasks and fixing problems that prevent the software from working the main difference here imho between a typical platform engineer and the mle is that the platforms mles build maintain are explicitly customized and used for ml software to attend to the unique ml requirements which a typical pe would not be aware of but an mle would,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cXZqMUoyVVlNN093WjdHTTZsU0RPRTdFMnViQ2dreVZncTRzOUNnMXdSZ1dSaW9KWWR2cEp6bmlneHNUa0owUEplY1FvUHFMa1M0RWlvNHI0dG9lVWc9PQ==

first why you say sdedata scientist sdes and ds are not related both are important but mles are more in demand pay is comparable pay really here depends on the employer skills and educational background not the titles also as an fyi neither are entry level roles so the background really matters here when it comes to pay ds have more creative work and they have a better chance of validating the impact on the business,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YXZOekxJZ1hUTE1HN2JoSW5adXBVbVdpUXdWMVAwRHc2cmJFQnlzd1FzSUlCbTQxU3NjelZoY1pnZXNEbF9NQ3NCRF9xSVk5LUNmRWg3NUF6QmlkeVE9PQ==

phd in computational sciences here with bachelor in psychology and ms in methodologystatistics i faced the struggle to leave academia which is quite difficult sometimes more because of the mental impact it has on your mind changing context role friends what is called the comfort zone than because of your skill set my advice would be dont worry friend and keep trying some companies are reticent with people who comes from academia as you will have to prove that your expertise is related with the field it took me lot of resumes sent to be able to get a few interviews at the end of the day i got what i wanted also i decided to go for a juniormedium data analyst role instead of data scientist or data engineer i think i have background to be data scientist and some notions of data engineering few but i preferred to be humble go for a job with less requirements and then start climbing from there when i have at least one year of experience and i can refine my skills with real examples my case also is from spain i guess that if you are from the us you will have the enormous advantage of english being your first language which is the thing that at least here open most of the doors also try to keep doing some courses to keep your resume updated maybe you could try datacamp or something but most important persist,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VzZsRG02UzczdnhDbmptRUM4S3NaSkw4TDRidFdTeTZxWVRKYmhWeGVZUjNqRHBycE9lNnRHLWtfdTVqNlc2Tlp4alVyQ21tU1I3UklQRUNxSkZBQ3otbFB3emFEV2lCWFNneU80RFpOXzA9
data science has become very broad in some applications data science has commoditized and is something you mostly do using specific software tools like microsoft bi tableau etc although you no doubt can do such jobs i expect many hiring managers to reason that you are overqualified and therefore if hired would look to find a better job and therefore risk leaving this isnt very pleasant and is known to happen to those of us who have a phd and then look to pivot into another field ideally you would look at data science roles that are more quantitative perhaps where you run experiments as well in some cases people may specifically look for ds with phd so add such search terms as well finance or some types of hardware engineering might be candidates machine learning is getting hotter and it still requires a fair bit of coding i think you would have no problems learning how to deal with ml showing that you are fluent in some standard tools and frameworks is an easytomeasure quality that stands out in the <number><number> seconds of cv scanning you typically receive investing a few hours into some mlai coursera certificates could help i am sure that with your background these should not be too challenging otherwise keep rolling the dice to drive up the base rate the job market is not working that well generally the silliest reasons are far too often used to either hire or not hire a person having a connection at the company you apply to goes a long way it is weird that still is the case but it is,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UG5nN2EwdzhuaDJOSW5JY29wWURNLWRERkZRTUhTNW9neDdjV0xjWXpuMU5qT0h2VGRDQlU5cE9ZQ2dNOFJnSEdvVGFpSFFkNGd5dUhHMFI4Ykt6MlJlWnd0aldNenkzYmRnVGpJcTVGaVE9

academia has a tendency to make you feel like you need to be laser specialized in order to land something you feel like you dont have enough ml to be a data scientist you program and use sql and spark but youre worried you dont do it data scientistly enough honestly youre overthinking it here is the deal with industry you get the job first and then you learn how to do everything its not a grant proposal what youre going to find is that the challenge of the job isnt highly technical its mostly communication you may have some hyperspecific packages you need to learn here and there depending on what youre doing but what it comes down to is accurately listening what your bossclient wants doing whats best for them and then showing them what you did in a way that they can understand the tools you use to get there are sometimes very specific but none of them are hard especially to a hard science phd anyway yes youre gonna have reasonably good chances at landing a data scientist machine learning engineer position provided that you apply to a lot of them,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bWp2ZHBYeGtGUEtLU0tsRHRycnQzVGkwczkyMFlUdko5QkczSk52SXpGNkotV3RKZTg0MHI2Rk5UbXAxOUF4NVVLRUZDZ3JYcGh6LWkxVHBQbmFlUEE9PQ==

i will not pretend to have one answer to rule them all but here is my reasoning for why they might to some degree there is a theory of why education helps with employment that is not what most overeducated people like to hear and that is that education is a signal for being a person of sufficient intelligence diligence and character the signal value of a degree from harvard oxford or stanford is itself high since those institutions are understood to enforce some standards and create highvalue networks an extremely smart person but with a degree from a noname university may be as smart or smarter than a fancy degree person yet if i had to bet on career prospects the high signal value school will count for a lot this is all to say that my assessment is that the op has the skills to do data science work what may be lacking are signals to that effect it is too late and expensive to go back to harvard so to speak rather the coursera certification can signal interest and desire in the field the person screening the cv does not have to understand that having solved large systems of differential equations numerically for a condensed phase to take one possible topic in computation physics makes a person able to solve for principle components of products in online shopping carts the case i am making is that signals matter knowledge without signals attached does not help in the early stages of the hiring process in the latter parts raw intellect matters more there are exceptions of course in the small companies i have worked for and hired in the past i was often the first to read cvs and i am technical but one thing that happens as large companies scale is that they offload the technical staff from early hiring decisions so smaller companies may be easier to get to with nonstandard signals,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NzZINmVDWGxlZTNOUnE5NE45MFU5LTItMVpGSy03T0tIbjhHTXNGM3VDT2VXOUhKN0Q5V2JNYVE4UVRnSkItdWxmYldsbUFnZlFZTElaVzRqMDNzeTBMTWtRcDk4bEt6TUhMQ1NYMk9VXzg9

hi hiring manager here of course that i can attest to my experience but while having a phd is a big bonus it isnt a coincidence that it isnt a requirement for most of the ds jobs i myself have two masters and let me tell you what we call research is very disappointingly different from what they call research in academia in a startup you have to be able to move much faster and do incremental progress on a weekly basis you have to be able to work with people treat them with respect and work together towards a shared goal math as a physics phd i am sure you have enough knowledge about theoretical concepts in differential calculus thats not what we do we need to know enough math to read papers and to make sure we dont do gigo but not much more than that we had a phd person who was a dick and it was a chore working with him he was fired quickly as a phd person i am sure that you will find it pretty equally to learn crucial concepts in ml quick and to a level deeper than most of the candidates just make sure you hone your other skills as well it is a teams game,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3a0JoZUNXNkozdUNFWmxxNE1lelpUMjJwdlFHTkxNSm56eTNQZXNKVEY4ejY5a0tBZUpTSlJJcVBfZzlNQ25mdkpMU28xZU1aVHhuc1B4VG1XMmZaLVE9PQ==
i think some of these people are wrong while i use to have to one pager i dont think that is very standard anymore and <number> pages is fine at least thats how my consulting firm had my resume laid out one thing i would do is list a skills summary here i would put every little tech you have buzzwords also check the job posting to see if they mention specific things and try to have those in resume again i wouldnt lie but if job talks about making regressions and you know how to do that list it the reason for this is most of these resumes go through some screener that tries to figure out how good of a match you are until you get through this you wont even talk to a human another way is to maybe go after certificationsclasses or projects that are directly in data science while some people in hr are good sometimes they have no idea how things relate and will go well i dont see data scientist even though a physics degree would be fine,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3OUxaQ1kyUjhsQjFGVEdIX19vZ2h4RlB0LWc5VC1kTnRMVVUxemxmN1h3eTJWUHBoLVJJcmJ4R0VQR3huN1JoZzg3ZzRoejZTTnRBd1VHUkFoWG41Snc9PQ==
you are mixing tools and technologies with skills you should not compare tableau with regression or ztest talking about tools sql is the most basic and most important thing one should know in this field followed by either python or tableaupower bi depending upon exact role pure bi role will require tableau or power bi where data science roles require python intermediate knowledge of excel is required like pivots and all coming to stats part good foundation is definitely required for someone working in analytics i have also done mba in analytics from a top university in india statistics was compulsory paper most of the tests and regression we did in excel python was covered as part of different module any other visualisation tools were not covered i will suggest you have statistics analytics with python as compulsory papers with other electives like marketing analytics optimisations operation analytics econometrics etc,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3LXV5dGh2eXVsaG5WZm1zMGJrZjZLVjRUWFJBMmFSUFVYYk5ZMjJBUGhqN2FxVThSeXhhdVZOWi1sSlJWSDUyOG52cE1zLVNJWmRHWlRnVHNaczdwMlNpTHJZU3RvNGwyeDl5ZnRlaFpwYlE9

i have some mba after started working in analytics it definitely helps in multiple different ways for example you will be able to find new use cases much faster or present your findingsinsights to stakeholder in more effective and convincing way but what i will suggest in your case is that try spending more time with stakeholders when they ask you do some task ask why try to understand theory processes and challenges,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NDE2ejJiS2lmZllqUnM3dWxxN1lTRTBrZTVGR2owNXhBWjVHZ2VIczhpUFJBa29iZFlTbzZFYjdWd2Fac1BxWG40VDRpcFpGdmVHQU1Tck5fVllCQzU3Yk5ORzI2c3hBaFZrZTVWaXdDZ0U9

thats great to hear definitely agree on the idea of spending more time with stakeholderclients most of my day to day work streams come from my manager who is the one interfacing with clients by the time im integrated into any of those meetings the conversations are much more in the weedstechnical which i definitely understand i just find it hard to connect what were working on and talking about in those meetings to the broader business goalproblem,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TEdzTHBxcEFpbnpSckRodU9obHh3R0RVejRQS1JJOVZBNkFRZGJ6XzdwV3l1YVdpanlGNkVJM2F0c2I2Z3VhZnA2YkdQeEFlb0tJc0d4ZnlhR0VkdlFMMnJYMnVOVzBCTUJhTm0tVHkwMEk9

<number> great <number> <number> <number> will vary from one role to other but in general good with numbers and data ability to work with ambiguity good communication skills so that you present complex findings in effective manner coding skills i started from andrew ng ml course btw i also teach in my free time and on weekends in case you are interested <number> i dont find any significant challenges sometimes it gets irritating if your company data is shitty,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bGZ2YTgxQVE0RkFqVEwwNXBPSG5ucHFvcXNhZW5jLTJ6LVVEVW5HSFBmdlhpcWVVOXNmY2NJUWFYYzN4RGR6VlE5ZFk1N3ZIdDZBVWo2OTg5LTFRajNDWVpWbWFEUGwzXzNvcVpUUEc5SE09
its not easy stereotype is that data scientist cant code rather cant software engineer its easier than getting a junior role as a self taught though the more stuff you did outside a jupyter notebook the better and wenn you manage to get a role you wont be downgraded in seniority which is nice what makes it hard is that swe really is a different practice than ds so your skill level for positions is that of a new cs grad but you get bonuses on the soft skill side for having work experience working technical and everything that comes with that the only way it could get really easier is when you go for an eng position in your co and just transfer departments if you have people that like you and want you on their team,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ZHFUeXZ4Slh4c2tYSWp2eHY0WHBOT3FBamJjcXE5T3ZLS3h0TWt2MmtqMExrRXI5VnFGYW1sQlo5OXdtZ0F4MXVLOWxHRFRiZmlFaVBOM2V6LWhBWkE9PQ==
you are a computational physics phd the question is not whether you have the technical chops its whether you can handle business problems frankly a majority of job descriptions are just badly worded requests and you quite often have to figure out what the real problem is yourself even if you get a job these are the skills you have research skills analysis skills coding and stats skills the first <number> matter more than the third on average many firms who have ds roles dont have the infrastructure to actually enable the work that needs to be done they want to get somewhere and ds ml ai genai are the magic words to get there to take a liberty and generalize theres roughly <number> rough issues niches <number> basics someone wants a ds team or ml magic someone is needed to translate ambiguous problems and make headway towards some solution from really really basic start points most of the time you will go to making dashboards <number> data engineering the firm is slightly mature and is actually looking to set up data pipelines automation and the like also time will be spent on dashboards <number> ml models there is enough data to actually do predictive analytics and the rest also time will be spent on dashboards the further you go from tech sw etc the less infrastructure will be baked in so its safe to say that most firms are dealing with issue <number> and simply do not have the data to do ds your cv is doing the job of saying <number> broad things <number> notice the phd> i know stats <number> i know what stats techniques matter for you researched x problem identified approach y and delivered solution in n days currently ghosting is a very common problem especially in tech dont be disheartened,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UHpFS3NNZ2s2SFBMakZPeEE0bjNzZ0hQa1pvbC1fUDFmbFctR2tZQ09Cc0ZaVVZmdlBvQ3JJM25vNzFHSWE2Vkc4WmZNMjI5YXNMOEY3a183a0JES0E9PQ==

i transitioned to data science after a postdoc theoretical math <number> years ago the market was a lot hotter then one of the problems youre facing even if you dont know it is that there are people who got laid off from google and facebook i certainly would interview you first but im an oddity in this field most people are going to go with exgoogle or exfacebook there are two skills that you havent likely needed to develop as an academic lab data is i assume relatively clean real world data is a disaster how things are collected over time isnt always consistent fields might come and go how things get labeled by humans isnt always consistent there are always major data issues that need to be worked through to make something work the other skill is more of a soft skill thing communication with software engineers and productproject managers depending on whether youre working for a software product company or as a consultant it takes some time to understand what the needs and goals of these roles are and how to communicate and collaborate usefully with them and also to understand when theyre great at their job and when they suck at it and how to work within each of those scenarios as far as concrete advice dont think that taking an entry level position is beneath you my first role paid <cur>k in the midwest where thats livable and the work was definitely beneath me but i moved up quickly and have a pretty solid career to date with your programming skills you could also consider software engineer positions the upside in pay is quite a bit higher and the market might be less fucked you might still need to start with a junior position but you again should be able to move up quickly if you absorb what you need to know and can knock out hard problems like youre used to doing,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cEJVZ2VmRWl5UGNzREp1ZzNQTG5TSXk1cmNsN0RIdExHRTFQa0s1RTRCc0E0S2t0eDhDV3NtQlF3Z2FKSVFIV05GR1VKRXdIWmtiUnNUTmg1RG1Hamc9PQ==

my advice is get your resume perfect then get those application numbers up and get some interview practice once youve put in a couple hundred apps you should have some interviews youll likely fail your early interviews but you need to get the bad interviews out so to speak once youve got some practice and use that to improve your skills then work your network hard to get your foot in the door at some more companies i really recommend being prepared by the time you do this because referrals are guaranteed interviews at some places and you dont want to waste those,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QzJFWWRLemxLTlpmUmlKRmJkXzhHYzJPLUo4ejZHNnJIaEliM25UaEFnNXFxbXFCS1BlcDFwdExCZjJsd2FITF9rS2FwcmdKckVPeXZocXZxR3ZCalE9PQ==

you could absolutely get a job as a data scientist analyst or software developer targeting algorithms engineering machine learning and other more specific roles is likely going to get more bites on the software side you also might be surprised at how many physicists work at financial institutions if you can tolerate being around money guys then consider broadening you search to investment firms hedge funds etc being a contributor to a foss project is great having a portfolio of stuff people can actually see is a great benefit these days try not to get too discouraged the job market is way more rough right now than a lot of people want to admit everyone has to project an air of success so a lot of companies just keep positions open with no real intentions of filling those roles the problem of socalled ghost jobs has been getting noticed since at least <number> ive read that a survey of hiring managers had ~<number> of managers admit to posting a ghost job for various reasons even still lots of postings stay open after the role is filled via oversight or laziness even software developers with years of experience are having to send out hundreds of applications and get single digits of responses back while youre searching id say just try to find a project to work on which will tighten your skills if you want a job in machine learningai then focus on pytorchtensorflow and other industry tools and learn the industry jargon what companies are really looking for is someone who they can imagine sitting down on day one and start making a profit with essentially no extra training or guidance that doesnt actually have to be true but you should be able to sell that image to them,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3eUYxVEFTYTBrUHhZbFlqWVdFMkc3c0pSTGJKOTdIelFfcFRDdHM2ZUdXWHk3NWZCQ2pQRjZWcTI2TVFYWGZJODM4dl9pdnZCUjE5OWRpRnNGM0wydHc9PQ==

how would chatgpt review code without knowing all the context that goes with it reviewing code is not simply making sure it runs chat gpt also has no guarantee of correctness if chatgpt can label my data correctly then theres no need to develop a model at all whos going to make sure chatgpts labels are correct,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SFZZdUR2emxObks1ME5MSWh1aTdmSDI4dEVoaUJpV3o0VjNDZUZkU1lGdGxOREFaRzB0Q2lJSGVPRW9KSTJvd09ucHhESXktX0hhR0xVaVFiVjdCalE9PQ==
youre still going to need a smart human expert who understands the codebase and the project to write clever tests if you want the testing suite to provide a lot of value but yeah at least its nice to autogenerate the dumb parts the concern is that it will be used as an excuse to not do the harder part of it which tbf is often skipped already anyway,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SkFoU3Z2LXVLNGRNa2FHdVNYUUdXWllCLVkwS3ZzZEhSY1Iwa1JXUkwxaXVRelcwZlFUakN4LUJ5aVBJdHdxTFRZVjExRE1JYUlEdUtHRzlzeW9keXc9PQ==
lots of ways to provide context and context windows are growing very quickly skilled human coders have no guarantee for correctness either so the status quo is already one that is tolerant of occasional mistakes question is which does better on average when put to the test gpt often does better as judged by other humans even where gpt cant code as well as a human its getting better all the time you use gpt to label your data so you can train a much smaller and cheaper model to do the same thing with less overhead come on man these are depressingly softball points with obvious rebuttals,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3T1hLLWgwVDRfZ0RsOVdodXpuNmJiaXpsblBEOG96XzdZTTQxTEktdUxJN2I2TXE0QjJlV3NNMlVoeVM2NGRGTDVIUGtJZ2JsQkV0UmNBY1BYUkpJd2ZVQWl2Rm43N3Iwc2FIY3F5SGg0cW89

as someone who went through that the difference between job satisfaction and burnout is not normally the type of job its mostly the teamcompany culture and to be clear there isnt just good and bad company culture everything is a tradeoff so for example my first job had great worklife balance in turn it felt like nothing that we were working on mattered that much and everything was super slow so i got burnt out from not getting enough done my second job had terribly worklife balance but i pumped more work out in those <number> years than at any other point in my career so it was like running on adrenaline its exciting to work <number> hours week but also put out a bunch of stuff out into the world but then i got burnt out from getting too much done another example i had a job where everyone was expected to be a handson worker there was no leadership in terms of people who just manage everyone needed to be able to model code etc when i first joined that sounded great because i was leaving a job where management was explicitly disincentivized from doing hands on keyboard work which again burnt me out and for <number> years i enjoyed it and then i realized man im getting old i dont want to code every day and started getting burnt out i know people dont like to hear this but you need to try other jobs do your best to filter during the process and keep trying until you find a job that fits what you need and be prepared for what you need to change every couple of years,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3S0NwQlllU215TGVxZVM1U2FNYzBBQk5jTk1QTmg5ZnVXVUFmRV81YmxmQ0I4XzRiQmpDZ05mSExtU2Y1Q19xNUptMHlOMHFXY0IxbUFkdlZLRm9WVWc9PQ==

i suspect most people just use it to get global feature importance the plot is also nice for debugging because you can look for unexpected relationships you can use the results with some filters to get a sort of segmented importance which might also help thinking about how to do better feature engineering but this is a bit awkward the truly local case is useless because shap doesnt guarantee any boundary its impossible to tell a client eg if you increase variable by x then result will be y,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WjFuaV9wbmQ5eHRLRlU4M0dBZW9mM3NrUDIxcWJIR0VXemFDaF9xWEVuZ21XMUtRS2ttdW12RC1QWlNVUldHNktJVlQxVUx4UUk1eVE3dE1mR1U0Unc9PQ==

i definitely remember having trouble interpreting and trying to explain shap values to others but once you figure it out youve got a workflow you can use them for most machine learning models and most of your ml explainability needs whether thats variable importance understanding what relationship your model is attributing to a feature and the response interaction effects etc i find shap values make explaining a model substantially easier and quicker to code up compared to any other ways ive seen having the ability to explain individual predictions can be essential in highly regulated environments where the decision you make based on a model could be challenged by a customer and you need to be able to explain exactly how youyour model came to the decision you did in general shap values give you a big toolbox to explain what would otherwise be opaque black box models,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YzcwNHlGS215VWNrM3ltbGhrU1Y0UjlrQXJ6MHk2NG4yRC13Y3dXVTlZTl9UT1RjVDZlV0o0cmpMT2pLeGNKN01qMldSN1gwSW5henRCVzUwZFZkNHc9PQ==

its very simple how much does your model change when you get rid of a feature thats the shap score of the feature we use them for complex models in genetics when were trying to understand which sorts of features are important if you have k features and the top <number> are all similar then that tells you something about the model or if you have k features and some perturbation affects <number> of your features it might be nice to know if it affects the top most important features disproportionally from the bottom ones,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VnY2RE1PbVpNRGtUbVVKWDRfWmZuVVpJdVBPaUZqSTJGR1lib2xfQ1M0Mnd5dFVVSkdoRmlwaG1UQTB2OTg3eUNIT1RZamVqaXo3b2NEdGg4Wm5ZSHc9PQ==

itt people completely missing the point that ai rapidly improves and will very rapidly be able to do things that it isnt able to currently the short answer is that nobody knows what the future holds ai cant fully replace data work right now and it may be anywhere between a few years and a few decades until it can but one thing that is certain is that ai will automate many of the parts of the job that are less subjective meaning that if <number> of your job is writing code and <number> is communication and ai can replace the calculation part all of a sudden aggregate demand for data scientists drops by <number> large teams will be downsized and certain responsibilities that currently come under the banner of data scientist may be outsourced or folded into other roles or none of that may happen any time soon but people miss a lot of these critical details when giving a simple yesno answer,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eXpwUVdkT0tiU3VZVVREVnJ6aDFwbkxGUkR2bkRrM1R1bTNRNnYtUG9oWXV3V0dFZGpyZnAwajVlVVVVcHNHYW1tck1PR1hnajdGMUpodGNaRkNRU3lLeW0zczI4RzlmUVR3N0xZVGJkQTA9

while i mostly agree with you and upvoted your comment i dont think using zero shot classification for labeling unlabeled data is particularly useful because either youre having to manually check the output gaining nothing in terms of productivity or youre blindly trusting the classification if youre blindly trusting the classification you dont need to train a model after you can just use the llm to run predictions on new data so the labeling becomes moot sure you could manually label a small portion of the dataset so you have a performance metric for the zero shot classification but that performance is unlikely to be good unless youre working with a very generic nlp problem,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4MEJBbWxkWmZjbE45MUJaQmluZDhPV3Z0cnBoTVdLdURiRnBpSVFYMlZkY0phdVJrV2Rad0Q3YVB5dnM2aER4dEFLNUpwdEVRYUxyY0JvVUhCOTdCN0E9PQ==

i have a family member who is a professor and we often discuss the differences between academia and the real world in academia you are expected to continuously learn and eventually teach with the expectation that you should know everything to avoid being looked down upon however in the real world employers value someone who is smart enough to admit what they dont know and willing to learn in the job market once you know enough to avoid major mistakes you are considered qualified you continue to learn and improve on the job as you become proficient you are promoted to more challenging roles because its difficult to find someone who can handle them since you already understand the company culture its easier to train you on what you dont know than to find an outsider who might not fit in this cycle of promotions continues until you reach a point where you cant perform a task which is rare if you are truly intelligent,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4STJNaFdTQXNaMnEwQV9sRlEySW1VbXprUm1sWUhxMXk5dEpqV0dSREl6eUc4RXhsekhaS0dmTFlOa2RJVEowSXo1cmd1LXc0OWxYMU1ycGdkaHE0RUE9PQ==

my first job out of grad school was a senior level position in ml and i had never even touched sql or spark ive been working in that and similar positions for years now and i still look up basic commands every time i use either of them as long as the work gets done thats enough familiarity with the technology when i get a new hire i have to handhold them through learning the processes we go through at the company how do we do pull requests how do we make things run on the cloud etc that is the kind of stuff thats different at every company you will definitely be learning those things on the job when a new hire says my sql is bad how do i even start this or how do i connect to github or how do i configure a python environment none of these are problems i help them get started then turn them loose to work on it and look things up that using them on a regular basis step is exactly the part that you will learn on the job what does piss me off is if when new hires cant understand what i want them to do dont ask questions and just end up getting nothing done that is almost always due to them worrying that i will discover that their skills are not already perfect another related problem is if they dont understand the business needs behind what were building and end up making something complicated but useless this is also due to lack of communication the way that we try to screen for this in interviews is by talking people through coding problems are they asking about the constraints about how we want to receive the results or are they just making assumptions running into a wall getting stuck and berating themselves or giving up without asking the interviewer for help this is how you prove you have the communication skills discuss coding problems with interviewers not like its an exam in school but like you would with a real problem on the job,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4THhIZnpXZWZIWXdSSTNjNlB2LTNSQm4zQ0RPVlI0MHlOY2I4UWxIaWw4d1hwS3VKcEJIWmFQZTVURW9RejRDSTl4d1o3Y29jQlFhSTE4Z1NaSE5faGc9PQ==

thats a quick way to suicidal and ai works well with small context but if you pretend to do a full deploy and developement of an aplication using only ai you are crazy because you will spend days trying to fix that for the other part of the report is more usefull that a human do that because ai is really bad at understanding and gaining context from big systems a human tends to better understand it the point is that ai can get you insights of a review but it can not review it only by itself it need someone behind to make the full analysis,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bWdGemRycGtob3JTeS1ubWNQSllOR0ZYMXdiVlRTV2tTamlKNF9jcE9DT0gxV2RNNF9jVVhsUEM0UTNsYTU2XzFmVVJWdWMyUzBhYmVacDJIVHBrUnJ1X1lLUmh6SklqMEc2VGVPS0pZVDA9

dumb down your resume based on the role and delight them in the interview in general the hiring managers look for people who are coachable easy to work with and have reasonable experience with the technologies used in that role formal education is optional approach it with i can get your job done mindset you will have easier time no one wants to hire overqualified people because they know you will get bored and not going to stick around for long,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eE9fY0FyR29TU0t1OEIyd2JNNS1sSEgxeDBGdTl6NlBON2hlWGdyNU92VjU0UGx5RExaU2J2V2hyWjVvcFlYc0JTYlpNZlp2RDV0UXVRLUQySHJpMFE9PQ==

not ds but in bioinformatics still relevant as theres a lot of overlap no however ai wish we could call it something else tools will enable some people with no technical skills to do analysis and have no idea what theyre doing and spit out answers businesses will often just use those until they get bitten in the ass by edge cases nonperformant code if it works properly at all lack of consistency and lack of ability to explain how their solutions were found to stakeholders data scientists will end up having to check this kind of work which will often take just as long as doing it themselves and will have to redo a lot of things best case scenario involves data scientists being more productive when the powers that be understand this but theres going to be a lot of push to just ask chatgpt in the shortmedium term no you wont be replaced by llms or anything coming in the next <number> years jobs will change and tooling will change questions will change i foresee more difficulty in managing up though even after were all further through the hype cycle it does get exhausting to keep up with the latest hype and manage expectations of people who have no idea how anything is implemented or works,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4YVZOT3lIZU9FWjNHeEgwUGcyTXozVjUyYzNqY2xsbGNCYzI0X3ZZV0JDZ2J3OXlDTmJ3X3MtUDRhcWFrcUcyY2ttREJlaGYyVGVNQjFneGZCVUJ3RGc9PQ==

research the company on reddit glassdoor and blind you should not trust blindly what the hiring managers and hr tell you about culture wlb etc ask about delivery expectations what are normal project timelines how often do you deal with fire drills you also have to just like the people or not sometimes you just dont get along with people no reason behind it if you get that feeling and have options feel free to reject offers that are in that category edit also with regards to your earlier post a lot of this work stuff is just reaching out and making friends with people asking if they have time to hang out after work or helpingasking for help corporate culture is something that is quite similar to clubs at school mixed with cliques at school thats the main way to navigate it there is no secret language secret sauce its just people and you gotta make sure they like you or you at least stick with the ones that do all comes with experience if you are struggling keep trucking along and try new things when youre hitting a wall there is no special way to tell if youre a fit for a company unless youre looking for specific benefits already and a company hasdoesnt have those you gotta try to adapt sometimes,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4dDQ1V0NFOXFfSDlaYkc0NEdTZGpKNXRvbnJqRUFNQUhsdGhHRXo1WnI1dVI4WUxoaW1iZTAyZ2lGTWJyaWVRSTFkb19oN19sd1VISGRmM2NJaVR3REE9PQ==
id treat company reviews on a site like glassdoor with a huge grain of salt first people with negative experiences are much more likely to post a review than those with a positive second some employers make severance contingent on not writing a review on a site like glassdoor so if you see few reviews or only positive reviews it could be an artifact of that sort of policy its just not reliable information for individual contributors in large organizations your relationship with your manager and your team culture is more important than overall company culture thats something you can observe assess the hiring manager and anyone else you interact with during the interview process is it someone you want to work forwith,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VFI1R1ZMS05ZSzJxaWM4MURxeGhxWWhzck9CcFZXVE5rVG9LTFVYajJtNElEQnhlNFVXRnFIR1RlSHRkR0VqRmlSY1pXVUlzOEpOb21qRzNoQTlOWmc9PQ==

its interesting that you say that because i have found that when multiple people repeat the same thing on glassdoor whether good or bad it tends to very much be an underlying theme of the company people have individual experiences that vary ofc but conditional on having a certain number of reviews the general experience of being an employee at that company comes out btw its not true that negative reviews are more likely to be posted the avg rating is above a <number>,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4Si1IM1E4WVIxU1VhVmI3dXZ1b3BfTC1vVndoNERmYVQ3Z2oyQlkwY29MdUZ3QkVBODdCSVFzcWE1YVVnVFd3UFdUM1VreUpVWS1YRlN2Q0MwRjNHSmc9PQ==

some of these are being slowly automated though for example at my wifes school she orders lunch and a robot delivers it nothing real fancy but that does replace a job there are robots mowing lawns and mopping floors these replaced jobs many didnt want to do anyway so it wasnt as much of a replacement as a cost savings to those who needed that service done we do have lots of big industrial robots doing things and have been for decades but those are very repetitive tasks what we need is the robots that are doing unique tasks and figuring things out or working in unique situations for example there isnt a lot of reason why we do not have robots that could build a house and build them much better than the folks that do not at least in the usa especially here in tx these will not be a hardcoded thing of doing abc but will need to work with each other following a blueprint being able to work together and that sort of thing replacing folks at mcdonalds with robots like the boston dynamics ones tied with ai to do their jobs and work together as well as taking an order is coming and will be here within a couple decades this will be expedited if minimum wage goes up as in order to make more profit they will need robots over people robots can also work <number><number> never take sick days do not need insurance and as they become smarter they will be able to do those jobs but yeah weve had that idea for <number>+ years that robots will do everything and we clearly are not there yet you cant argue we are not closer today than we were <number> years ago though,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4S2NhNUhGRkxuVW15Wko1ZFVwbHVOckpScEZaVEliWFU3V3lycWZSV0lZOWJJeFJiMnBTdjQ5ZzZyWERHTDczUWEyamRuM3lTLVBWNFVzZm9PcjNCaWc9PQ==

devils advocate here from the perspective of having been on both sides of these presentations often the way that data scientists cite roi or value uplift is naive at best and worst it can offend businessside managers who understand the economics of the business and see the roi claims as reductive not saying data science doesnt create tremendous value it sure does and it should be paid and valued for it but outside of some crystal clear ab tests the data science group wont have a clear enough argument to make about roi without sounding tone deaf the businessside manager who respects you and values your partnership will still roll their eyes when you start talking about lifting sales or directly cutting expenses if you dont really know what you are talking about,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4dmhIZFpWZDNtOUxfUzA5M1FhWjQzR05XVjJQRGNnMGpUOHhRUlN2dUI3QlJtT0FHRTBENEE4U194d0dwN3ctVUxwOWFEdF9nbmhtOWY1QlVxenpiVWE0eXd3ckVVdmNMbFJrNVoyZTV1clk9

not your jobshould be your managers to build this case through collaboration and leveraging hisher team members but you can potentially come up with a calculation based off of tracing your business decision all the way to where it affects customers and present it to your boss to disseminate depends on your industry and transparency of the teams you work in and with it may not always be possible for a junior analyst working in an isolated team youll need to potentially contact your customers to fuel the understanding to build out such metrics reporting and supporting with reporting itself can be a metric though not directly attached to a dollar amount can claim you indirectly supported the efforts of x number of employees which comprise y of the company as an example metrics dont have to just be dollar signs though to less effect with enough emphasis on the widespread impact the case can still be strong again this is your managers job to really put this big picture of your teams value together and communicate it both up and down the chain in the end if you cant make a case to justify your continued existence when corporate comes knocking youre screwed either way focusing on results and impact is important for these teams and again thats your managers job to keep yall on track and producing things the company finds value in its your job to do your best to solve the problems that come your way learn and sometimes struggle that you alone cannot control your destiny in the company and must rely on others for advocation no matter how talented or outspoken you are this is why people skills are so important,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VjZEOHlaQXZWbzRhc28wY21nbUNyR0VrMi1mZFVRUTVwT0RyWTBNb2hIRFp5dEtFMFdXVXo5enRYc1Z5aXNJOGpNaHlBWUotNUJDcTJKQzVTVThWNlE9PQ==

its many probably centralized data scientist structures actually are problematic in the many different functions they can need to serve the annoyingtoother departments prioritization lists and the specializations that they need to focus on it may be too disconnected from actual customers to truly function well integrated decentralized data scientists reporting to nontech verticals but all bound by a central support system like a communitya central data engineering team are far more commonheck decentralized in general is far more common and often how the centralized departments even start up edit as an example in a large company where you have whole teams of dses supporting various functions like accounting a centralized ds team may deprioritize the accounting team because other aspects of the company are more important then the accounting team fangales hr to get them a ds or ds equivalent to support their efforts and their efforts only rinse and repeat for the whole company eventually you end up with a main group of dses supporting one effort and a couple unofficials supporting the neglected efforts never ending cycle,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4YzV2TGI5MHJvRUlfY3BVWUVVQkZHYVFKdGQwV1c0dGg4ZU9EaDBsX2xrTl9kbTJVbFhGcjZhNEtkLUZDUmJCNjhteUp2M2N5a2xobi1ITFJuMjBRV2c9PQ==

yes it does but i thought if you wanted to reduce dimensionality you can ignore that but if you dont want to do that some things i do instead and mind you i just do these things because im lazy and dont want to think too much are <number> do one hot encoding and use sklearns selectfpr or something to remove unrelated columns <number> do some bivariate analysis on the column and target and bin the categories into a manageable amount and then do one hot but keep in mind that these are not standard processes i just do these to complete my tasks and be done with it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4M2wyZW12RU1ucU9Ed0RDQk04RXFjU3BpR1NhUTBmd21NbVpVemtPNm1jNWV1UjRqbi13YUlTRVpmZEswcmNBRVl6YXh5WjgzSEh1MzRtVmJkUGd5bFp3M3EwV3ZONW9GcFMzZWdUdVByOFk9

if your categorical column has so many levels is it really a useful feature in the first place municipal names can also be grouped together based on region or location isnt it or if you already have another column on regions you might want to think about whether there will be collinearity involved here else i guess you might want to explore encoding methods such as target encoding or feature hashing,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4N3lzUVhlbll2SkJGREFzM2dJTXQyVS1iV2k2U1RXVjRFMGZocDVRaEZHYnQya0NYMGdFZ25IalZqaDN1bXM3cUI4VGxmSFF1OVFxOVVERGo4S0ltY3c9PQ==

i just still find it crazy that people say theyre learning sql yet proficient in c r and python sql is by far the easiest of the four i feel like everyone sees only one side of cr and python and claims proficiencycomfortability python has millions of packages and even base python is infinitely complicated sql has three sets of functionsat least in my experience its read writedesign automate c is the source of many other languages and can be made to do so many things sql does one thing best databases r is a complicated multifunctional calculator that can be adapted to do many things that python or c can do sql has few flexibilities other than integrating with lower level lanaguages most use cases revolve around databases my main suspicion on this is that sql is the least copyable and pastable language amongst these four which is why to those who only develop surface level understanding of all these languages it feels the hardest or most complicated to understand since you actually need to know why and how something works rather than just a copy and paste answer,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4S0Y0Q3N3Smk1TGVCNFRnclNyLVVTYmdoYzVyY2JDT3JPTDM3MFRVSXJ4Zjk4QzM0YkgwOTNDdWs1QXNyX2J5bm8zd0s3Mm5Sb1BpNHUzSGNTQmpvOGc9PQ==

legal questions aside the only problem with the illusions of productivity question is the difficulty of measuring the outcome in real life contexts the fact that its difficult to measure does not suggest the net effect of tools like copilot one way or another it suggests neither that it helps or harms that said anyone who requires large randomly controlled trials and cochrane reviews to say whether something works is destined to never knowing whether ai tools improve productivity but if one is willing to consider some of the messier and more complex data i think it can and will become clear how these tools help people in time i dont blame anyone for wondering where all the large signals are in the data but its also not entirely unexpected given how it can take a lot of time to learn how to actually use llms i guess to me its clear that the raw materials are all there for transformative technologies based on models like gpt but as with any science it would be insane to expect the world to change after only a year working with those raw materials,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bndZQ3pUdE94S1N3T3piWjItZS1jdTNISmdtNzVpVnc3aFFlNV9IcHhfS1dzamRxbU44Y2tGRUE2RVlEWVN5d0hmOS1yNXIwbjlZTHhHeW81Rm1lT29zcXBmbldQSEgyRmwtQjVBQVMtNDg9

handling highcardinality categorical columns can be challenging in machine learning instead of onehot encoding consider label encoding hashing or entity embedding to reduce dimensionality label encoding maps categories to numerical values while hashing techniques like hashingvectorizer map data to a lowerdimensional space entity embedding like keras embedding layer learns dense vector representations for each category experiment with these approaches to find the best fit for your dataset and evaluate their impact on model performance using appropriate metrics,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ejdjQWNrazZUQUdVWUFQNW8xa0dCOUc3UVB1S0xacUc3S3ZWMEVBOXBSbS05cUNreXhEeE0zZXJKOHRkdmJETElRTkVrUThmbjFBZzVCSldDajUzdWc9PQ==

no terrible idea instead of seeking to remedy whatever perceived issues with this kind of bandaid you need to consider why you perceive yourself as needing this kind of drastic bandaid as a corp data science division lead who often encounters young candidates in your career stage it seems like you might be running into a fairly common issue which is that youre collecting internships and certifications for your resume like they were pokemon without actually learning the fundamentals leading to challenges in completing technical skill tests ask yourself this when youve taken your courses do you leave them with a solid understanding of the subject or do you usually study for the test in my experience the vast majority of candidates are the latter if youre in such a position then my advice to you is to refresh your fundamentals and to develop your soft skills if you do genuinely have a strong grasp of technical skills then id still recommend developing your soft skills with the time you have left in your degree one commonality youll find if youre ever searching anything along the lines of what makes a candidate most attractive to hiring managers on this subreddit is soft skills i promise you hiring managers are constantly seeing resumes from young graduates that are stacked but end up being a house of cards when it comes to actual capability i have <number>+ years in the field and ive seen resumes from graduates that are more stacked than my own with skills but it turns out that candidates will take a <number> month course or certificate on a skillset and just confidently label themselves as experienced and proficient extending your degree to stack on another internship just seems like the same type of resume stacking without substance if youre on track to graduate in <number> years why are you so worried about securing a job this coming august you should be applying to full time positions the year prior to graduation not <number> years ahead also while it is great that you have ambition to work at specific companies you should also know that working for a specific company should never be the end goal dream jobs are often overrated instead you should focus your career search on the goals you want to accomplish with data science and ml this will inadvertently make you more valuable for dream jobs as they will see a candidate with ambition that goes beyond simply getting a position at their company think from their perspective once you get the job then what,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MlV3bEwxVm44YUUtVmE5OEpmZEhKMGRVRnNlOHpMMjFDRERDbUVvVEdQaEdJLUVweFdYRnFHcFFkeWZSLXRqMjhwN3lDTkxuRWxkc3RFSklueTRsckE9PQ==

i have seen lots of mistakes with the basics and fundamentals of regression statistics probability basically lack of depth of really understanding under the hood of these statistical tools and ultimately improper applications of them are really common and nobody notices until a project starts having issues then thats when you find out a model is junk as someone who came in after consultants were hired for a project this was very very common lots of overboard tools used for problems that are much better suited to simpler methodsmodels and as a result much time being spent on diagnosing issues for example throwing neural networks at a time series problem as the first solution the toolkits people have are so vast that its often scary someone can fit gbms without knowing what the cart algorithm is or people not knowing what generalized linear models are but they know logistic regression in interviews ill ask about dealing with multicollinearity and evaluating goodnessoffit of models to see their response those questions alone can tell you a lot about someones depth of knowledge based on the conversations and rabbitholes they spark,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5blFfaHRoX3JHQ3FvMHhEQ0JLdkxRdVRSNFhQa3lZd0Q1dGlLUDIwdkx1VGxUUWFaUFE5VklUR3dYN1k2TS0xdzFDeFJoVHp5VVBPbmpZUDhtOXNsbmc9PQ==

logistic regression is a good choice as a baseline but xgboost would be a better advanced model rather than deep learning it generally works better for tabular data in either case feature engineering is likely useful also do you have the monthly repayment history or only did they default or not if you have the payment history then you can build a discrete time survival model to predict if they default at the next time step this allows you to use all your data,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5bjNfbTNXUUpaUTRUU1pEeGlic2xvQWhnSEdDYTNWcTF6OWhkbHNVM1F5SlJCTE5iaGtWbndVSGx3bUFNb3VWLWxfeS01MXAxSDZPOW9feWM5RkxwZ3c9PQ==

a bachelors thesis is about how you were able to use proper scientific methods how strong is your literature review can you define your methodology and follow it and more importantly justify your choices you have a background in stats so you understand how the model works but not how to use it so your job is to choose the model based on your analysis of the use case and justify it im fairly certain nobody cares about your code but everybody cares about your thesis focus on the academic production not the code artifact,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aWZKajVKSVpQYUNtdWFGOHpXbVpPZ1VTN01KUzd6WENrd1ZybWU2MFRib2daWW5ZTG5XaHl4bzRRWkpCdHB3anpFVUFvZzlZSVg5U1YyYWIyVUxGcjg3a29tNTQwVmhFa0hCcHp1eUVCTUE9

ill be honest ive seen a lot of statistics mishaps that had no practical effect but i think that has a lot to do with the type of company you work for and how direct the effect of ml is i was just talking to a friend about this over the weekend if youre a company like netflix or pinterest where there are a lot of segments of your business where ml is driving decisions automatically then bad statistics can have pretty immediate negative effects on your business for example if someone configures an ab test using the wrong statistical test and it overestimates the performance of a feature then you might implement a feature that starts degrading your performance literally instantaneously by contrast if you work at a company where all the decisions are still ultimately made by people then the margins that statistics tend to matter in dont generally end up applying because there are so many other barriers to prevent risk and ultimately the uncertainty of the system as a whole is so much larger than the uncertainty of individual ml assumptions,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MGNYNXI0YWhxWm82azN0Njltb2pXSklweVpodFR0Y0N0QjdiRzM5RTZTR1V5aFBLT2VudTdub0NfTHEtUnlRcUlWMjNycVNwQW9WT0xoeS1qRHhxbkE9PQ==

youre getting a lot of resounding nos but im not as convinced its as horrible an idea as everyone is thinking however your logic for why you should is bad these are bad reasons to delay graduation give myself a chance to intern at a larger firm have more time to study for technical interviews these are good reasons to delay graduation in order to graduate you have to take too many classes and you will be struggling to graduate let alone get good grades let alone get good grades and prepare a reasonable amount for interviews if its at the point where most of your graduating classmates already received a job offer and you havent yet now the other side of it instead of delaying graduation you could instead sign up for grad school given that the job market looks bad right now punting for another <number> years might be a good idea + you know getting a ms the only catch there is that i would only do a ms if i didnt have to pay for it ie a program that covers your tuition via a research or teaching assistanship or alternatively a program with instate tuition which makes it not terribly expensive as a side note not all jobs are going to require leeetcode or super extensive technical testing,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5OEY2bFB3WXBHaDI5SmpnV3Y0VWx6Qlc3cXExYVExQzFSNUVxaUZ1eFdFM2hDdXlOOGJuSk11MDNlUnliZUtMS2NaVGRIUnNreHB1Y2FrNjd3WVBSd2c9PQ==

youd be paying for another semester of schooling when you could be searching for a career if youre on scholarship youd be giving up timemoney still finding a good job takes time in todays economy for example i have a very strong resume phd ma ba with <number>+ years experience and i just switched jobs out of <number>+ applications i maybe got <number> call back for an interview eventually i landed an amazing job not due to applying but networking on linkedin and elsewhere the process takes a lot of time unless you get lucky youll be a much stronger candidate having graduated as opposed to graduating soon it might take <number><number> months to land a good job at least going an extra semester only delays that <number><number> months it wont reduce it at all i personally dont look at new hires internships i just look at skillscapabilities as they relate to the role i also dont care about degrees much since people can gain great data skills without school thats just me though others might have a solid reasoning for doing something different,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VkZoaDNVQ0M5ZnYybUVac0Fzb282SGFJTG5FcWFCMFByclRQMVF4dW5pQUQtMTRQelB0X1drNXR4cnNUY2M4WjU5RmpfczFuWlNOd0FZYVRkX1RzMllZREtmMzlrMkI2MllXODRfSUJ3N1U9

hello friends i have recently graduated with a bs in data science after having little to no luck with job hunting in my field these last few months i am now strongly considering pursuing grad school i have <number> internship experiences no faang or anything crazy but i definitely still feel accomplished to date all but one are highly relevant to dsml despite this i still feel i struggle to stand out amongst other talent while applying to junior level positions as a result grad school has been a strong consideration of mine for the last few months however all <number> years of my college career i have been financially independent due to some financial literacy and decent planning i was able to get through <number> years debt free and then finance my last <number> years myself i dont think i have the resources to put myself through <number> more years of college i will almost certainly go broke as a result the option of pursuing an mps has become appealing requiring less time and money this option seems to provide the flexibility i need in pursuing further education however i do have concerns about the long term implications of such a program my questions are as follows <number> ms vs mps in machine learning will i be at a disadvantage when applying to ml positions in other words is the ms significantly more appealing <number> has anyone who is reading this pursued such a program are there any regrets was this a good decision for you <number> are there any certifications or alternatives that i could pursue they may help in achieving dsml positions with simply the bs in ds and my internships finally any advice is welcome here regardless of if its not on this exact topic i always appreciate guidance and would love to hear any insights you all may have thank you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5eERrSWtZUUZ4SHZYZDg3ZmJqVVFLTnpFSnJJanFRV05iZWpITXlkdW1TclpLU25lSDQzS05VLXUwanJjVWVScjQtQV85R2ppUUcwZ29nZWZseVRldmc9PQ==
job postings like this either have a candidate already in mind or are incredibly unrealistic i had an interview the other day for a role which essentially required a phd cs with a focus on ml image analysis phd computational biology and a decade of experience on some incredibly expensive scientific equipment which only exists in a few labs i told them straight up that they needed to hire multiple people to meet their job requirements unless they were willing to pay a lot of money for one of maybe ten people in the world who met their criteria and that those people are probably tenure track at a great university or already pulling down an insane salary at a bigger company so good luck to them,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NkhEbGZpYVhRMWhCQk1Cb0psWGRnbF9tN0F2ZWxSWGM2UTgwM1JfY05TckE3d3dVWEhCS1c3dnQyWk4tSTJlNEVleXRUbXRWTG9rUkd3TDZlUEFhMWc9PQ==

it was super cool to work with it to be honest yes utility theory is the same utility theory found in microeconomics about preferences in my context it was for retail managers making a decision for physical inventory reviews the question posed from business was why they should do physical inventory reviews when the safety stock has not been activated or even if it was and there is an incoming delivery why do it like what is the benefit of doing it had to construct bayesian decision networks with utility nodes that would represent the managers utility to check the inventory vs not checking conditioned on a lot of parameters such as lowhigh stock historical sales demand forecast stockouts and so on,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZzBmZ1FnWVh4eUItM2J1NTFmT3hLd3huZDNfQlVqSHpRQW9yVk1VM1FKQTcxQnVhTWxRYTJqcUNCdU45cVM3WUFkbmRfNzk4QmtLWUo3R21QTjJIMnZsRVBzenNrQ3pxTmJwOWltS3JsNEE9

my points was to highlight that it might not be a good idea in case youre using regular linear regression to include high dimensionality categoricals such as location or product type at all since within the different categories the other features you are using might affect the target in different ways lets say we have two products a and b you are trying to model the sales for the upcoming week and you are using two features last weeks selling and a rolling average of selling per week for the last <number> weeks if you would include product as a model feature the model would attempt to find a good equilibrium of weights to apply to your selling features and explain the rest of the variance through the categorical however if you train two separate models for product a and b you might find that a is much more consistent in how it sells whereas b is more reactive the model for product a might result in <number>x rolling average + <number>x last weeks selling whereas model b could be the exact inverse attempting to model both of these products selling with one model using a categorical would be very suboptimal,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UHlyNzVQdWctV1QtbmZOb0llU19MaUtpREM5MDRySld5M01TeVVrdXZ4bWhMeXo1QTQ0MGdiaWxtTmRGVXF3VVVFalBHWnBLd2t5Z1laazhINnI3cmc9PQ==

i cannot share the exact code unfortunately but conceptually its just setting up an iterable list of models and reusing common code where possible not terribly sophisticated if you look at sklearn youll see a lot of them have very similar methods like fit and predict so my code went something like this modellist = logistic regression sklearnlogisticregression random forest sklearnrandomforest for mdl in modellist modellistmdl = modellistmdlfitx y testpredictions = mdl modellistmdlpredictxtest for mdl in modellist and on it went i did a few sets of predictions and then scored the test results this is just psuedocode so dont copy and paste or youll hate yourself,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5YlVraVhrVHRMN3l4bUN1cFlJWThNMFdMSmMxX3F4Q2xqem1rT1lYR1NaaTFWTklBQ1FFSDluSXhWWk9OQU9qU0p5cGhvLXJtbzFPUTI2OENheDVPUVJfRnpvNF81Tm1TR2JUSlFYT3dIRmM9

if the task is regression you would expect some kind of correlation between lat and the target and long and the target but there is no guarantee that this correlation would be linear in fact it seems more likely that it would not be linear instead try to fit a more complex model like a polynomial regression it is not generally the case it just doesnt seem to be appropriate to use something linear in this case,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZGZ5TlVrX2U4ZzliTzRRYVdtWGgyaV94NDJtYXBldHhtV0pudno2MkprZzQ5dmp0bjFrZGVLT0hld2dFc0c3UUo2akJIQ0JFN2xhTUdicjZRVlJ3bWc9PQ==
very rewarding task indeed sounds quite a reasonable task to work on thanks for sharing this setting common warehousing problems one can expect to be more simple like forecasting the offtake planning deliveries etc not a bayesian network similar problem that needs a newark is probably checking the provenance of goods if you track safety across your sourcing eg for diary products,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZUFLNGVEdGZDdTF4UlJDQ045eTEtMk5mNW1Jb1BpSUIyS194RmlYdXFWRFdaMzNxYzZBMGt2bzE2UnVEMzZjSUltcm90dklTT2pOQ21TR1pnLVFJN1E9PQ==

well sure for a recent graduate a research phd is a job after st <number> years working semiindependently masters programs take money from students universities make profits from it they will be less selective phd students specifically cost universities money specifically to a grant funded dissertation advisor if you earned money working in a competitive environment for a professor who has options to hire and succeed at creating something significant and novel through numerous years thats a reasonably reliable signal of capability and then theres the other signaling effect that the standard for being admitted to research phds is much higher than many masters programsbecause of course phd students immediately cost money and time and the hiring professors only want those who will help and contribute above their burdens,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZTVvZU9EOEsySmVyZWVpMWo5eXBDU3FUUW5BVlJnNDNGZGpJSDd3VlEzZHJrSjVrZ0xPNkphbzZ2RjJOQmJWcmVvX0dTMmpZUWVESDZJcHg3SmJZYlE9PQ==

i tend to be pretty biased in favor of folks with advanced social science degrees like mastersphds in poli sci cest moi psych sociology linguistics etcnot just econ many other fields learn just as much econometrics as econ folks doand probably branch out to other areas of stats as well plus i find these folks tend to be better at thinking through the theory behind a question and applying methods based upon whats actually needed rather than because its their favorite widget at least compared to some csdedicated ds degree folk ive worked with but i do know that <number> of the time im going to have to help them learn stuff like git docker project structure etcso its not all upsides but i find that stuff is easier to teach overall,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SHdXMW0yVWFEVUZjMTBCbUJlMDZXSjdUbUZXNDhfcXR2WDdTeUFTdGNyQ1lrcV9QZGxPZ1FBRGctZ1IySFJmeXd4dlNQd0Q4aXMySGtyWlZMZjl4VDVfeVNlX1daS0MwY2V2eV9HT1laMUU9

i may have something that could help systematize what youre working on and perhaps anything else you work on in the future an acquaintance of mine from stanford omar khattab created what has now become the most popular python package from stanfordnlp its called dspy<url> basically the goal is to blend elements of pytorch with llms to create prompting pipelines that are selfimproving without ever writing a single prompt this idea has become very popular in the past few months but this package was working on that problem long before one of the researchers created a pipeline that could do text classification with over k different classes<url> the package has a bit of a learning curve but its the real deal and many people who use it swear by it as the postlangchain method of building llm pipelines,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6MWRQSGVqODZVREp1RHpUU0JsdVFLNEU4dG9OSU5oNHVma24zN1RpSHhpWWdUMDNreUd6ckMxZ3JnMlBSYXg1S1U4d0VqdlZqVS1sZEQtYUdXbFR0X1E9PQ==
i was referring to both but of course im limited to just what i have experienced my biggest concern with the programs is it is one thing to learn how to create a model but it is an entirely more difficult challange to know when to create a model and i feel that second part is where schools tend to flop let me give you a real example from my experience i was tasked to make a product recommendation model and i remembered back at school we learned about the apriori algorithm and how that is exactly what amazon uses for their recommendation engine so great i set out to implement apriori i created all these indicators for demographics and whether or not the customer bought product x and i got some results but here is the issue my company only offers like <number> different products i know now that apriori doesnt work in this scenario because there isnt enough predictive power in just the <number> products and for the most part they are all quite independent and the average customer only buys <number> of them so the cross sell data is quite sparse combine all of this with the fact that these products have a defined order in terms of profit product a is more profitable than product b is more profitable than c etc and you start to realize really quickly that you dont need data science to solve those problem you just need a linear if statement if customer does not have a recommend a elseif customer does not have b recommendation b etc there is a lot more that went into this decision that it hard to elaborate on over text the final model is more complicated than what i described above but it is much simpler than what i would have come up with while i was at school,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SkI0M3RxREo1azFpUWNQY2k0eDJoTDBObkFhQjFvMXRkSEFZellwU0lTYzRWTERuWmlqZ3J2X1dhQ05BdlRVd090Z3hEaGRjVVVQdWJGeTVOVXFpdUE9PQ==

after scouring over this reddit it seems data science degrees are becoming this weird hybrid of watered down statistics and business with the job market saturated by data science majors from cash grab programs i am coming from a line of work in local government budgeting most of the work is simply in excel while were not busting out the arima models here maybe we should government budget forecasts can be woefully inaccurate the field is trying to move towards bi tools personally id like to become more useful in statistical analysis and stay ahead of the field or leverage certain desirable skillsets in more specialized roles even if it means moving towards federal work i had considered this<url> graduate degree program specifically the statistics track there seems to be a fair amount of r sas sql and plenty of statistics courses to choose from my question is does this degree pass the sniff test so to speak and do you think its worth pursuing rather than simply learning on my own the cost isnt an issue tuition reimbursement time isnt an issue planning on parttime student status thank you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6WjJPQU1RWWQxNFJwWmQ0MnZUOGRGdWRJUmQ5UFVTbjN6Rmo3UTJob0htaUF4Q3ZYZE9Hc0d3V3YxMjJGMU1wZUREWXl6Um56SGZncEo3UkVKekJHWkdxV01XTlFFdUQ3V182TkJaaDRtSXc9

this is where hypothesis testing comes in you test to see if the marketing strategy is statistically significant through either a <number>tailed ttest or ftest chances are youre going to run an ftest so you ask the question can you reasonably reject the null hypothesis that your marketing strategy components are close to or equal to zero if the t or f test comes back that the statistical significance of the marketing strategy is high then you can reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that the marketing strategy has a level of significance or level of causation against the dependent variable which would be sales most stats packages will have a way to automatically test it but its always good to test if each marketing strategy component is statistically significant vs the dependent variable the variance covariance matrix is good to see if youre going to have any high correlation between independent variables the more correlations between them you may need to change how you run your linear regressions because chances are your marketing strategies will influence each other driving up their significance thats why we test them together and individually to tease out variables that should have no impact on the dependent variable there are other methods you can use such as chisquared mean testing same idea as t and f tests observing the pvalues on the stats readout and then finally observing your r^<number> each of these together can give you a good idea of causation potential but again be careful with correlation making it seem like theres causation because variables will actually do that and mess with the process we have tests that are separated from the usual tests such as durbinwatson tests to see if your data is correlated with itself over time whites test tests to see if your data is evenly distributed and if not you can add weights or get more dataanova for <number> outcome on variances and manova for multiple outcomes on variances im sure im missing a whole bunch of other tests to check for heteroskedasticity biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median autocorrelation data correlates with itself over time and other issues that arise from running panel data the biggest issue youll run into with marketing strategies and testing for causation is that marketing strategies often carry multiple components to it so teasing out one component vs another becomes tedious as you have to test each vehicle separately as an independent variable and some of those variables have lagged effects such as tv and print so we often have to put in retention rates on the campaign pieces and each one will have differing retention rates then you also have to sometimes lag one item vs another because theres a lag effect from the moment the consumer watches the ad to when they go out and purchase the product my point is for marketing strategies its often a complex enough thing that a whole industry was created to essentially study disseminate and understand what marketing vehicles work best and how that consumer preference for media consumption has changed significantly over time edit to add youre always going to have noise outside of a variable in the real world theres going to be random stuff that will affect the dependent variable and to say there is no outside noise is disingenuous thats why when you often run regression models you have residuals its basically the left overs after teasing out the variables you are testing vs the dependent variable the closer to <number> of an r^<number> the less noise you experience or residuals in your model but that should be a huge cause for concern if your model fit is really close to <number> it means that your model isnt accounting for things outside of your control such as competition consumer spending issues government mandates etc unless your company is a natural monopoly theres absolutely no way you wont have some level of residual noise in your data that should indicate that youve got a problem with your data or your model itself,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6RFpHWmN4N2p5WUhHZTZERmVEbDA2SmRKZ0FkRl9GY0xKNHVRMVFqWHN6REJad2hwUFpDOXlwbmExQXhqSkU5eWIwWTQtazhGX0RMUl9QX0h4VjdUU2c9PQ==

spurious correlations in compositional data is an epidemic in bioinformatics there was a workflow developed called wgcna which really pioneered association networks in genomics but the premise was wrong because you cant use correlation to analyze compositional data since then there have been developments from geology that can be used as a drop in replacement rho proportionality and partial correlation with basis shrinkage that can be used instead of correlation then the rest of the workflow can be used there are also some other flaws in the workflow like signed and unsigned transformations of correlations but the idea of clustering in the network is cool just do <number> rho and you get your distance matrix,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6TUFpaElVVV9aNThEbE5kM1BRX1FvbkpUT3pUUjJVUHNkX3V5SUx0RkFJS0p3NTg1eFFGOFZWMXJVR2plamdCUnAtLV94RXJDd28zcU5rbWZBME90Zmc9PQ==

from a quick glance at the course material i would say the program looks pretty solid good options to specialize in one direction of data science which i have seen on this subreddit as being one of the more problematic parts of data science degrees lack of depth in any area i believe good data science teams should have a mix of statisticians mathematicians computer science expertssoftware engineers and business domain experts it is just impossible for one person to be everything so to see a program reflect that is a plus in my book if you can try to mix some coursework from other tracks as well specialization with some exposure to other areas will give you a lot of perspective on the data science field i would also try to reach out to some of the alumni on linkedin and reddit to see what they think although if youre more personally interested in statistics in general maybe try for an applied statistics degree with a data science track as well either or should be fine for your use case,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6ZVJXWmJ1OW9FT2ZnR0NzNFJpc1pJYlNSallFQ3RXcUxvVHhGaDAxdUVCdmJkSFhub2lJNVg5c2VfdTdXWnFubFk1cEx0all2THJwdEc5aUx2RWsyc1E9PQ==

basically much simpler than apriori and easier to explain the stakeholders the real solution we came up with is a little bit more complex because it does account for some business logic like if a customer bought b we wouldnt want to market c to them but all that does is add some ands and ors to the statement to have customers skip over a product if it makes sense from a business decision standpoint but that only makes this marginally more complex in the end my point was this whole thing could be done in just sql and excel,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6M29TRldxaU8tWms0LXZEa3I5QlNQbUZaS0M4ZC1oWDdkdEt5bnJycmt0azd6VWRXenRKUXJoXzJ3SnlqR1hpdVRNU0FaQnA1ZzdseXBDc3FhNjlieVE9PQ==

fair question but the features we see make intuitive business sense while i cant give you am exact analogy think of it as a fraud detection problem in the credit card domain every year you are likely to get frauds because of stolen identity every <number><number> years you might get a smaller fraction of frauds due pos terminals getting hacked every <number><number> years you might get an instance of a fraud due a organized scam network now if you want to model frauds and take a time slice of <number> years its very likely you will miss out on the last kind very likely that you will not have enough examples of the second kind too too have a comprehensive coverage of all reasons for frauds and a reasonable amount of examples you need to stretch your panel period ps want to clarify here that frauds in this case would not follow a set cyclic pattern like you might be led to believe in my example that was just illustrative in reality they are far more randomly distributed over time which makes the problem harder since if you pick any one particular year theres a possibility that it has higher occurrences of a certain type of fraud for some reason or vice versa not necessarily because of any set pattern,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NmZWQjNoUEM4V1dnbEJPcHBCX3VuUDY4VkQ0RHozUU5fQ3NZOFFSanVuZXJVdGJUZktfbktBM1ZmWXc2VEFSTlpKNWh2clRlLVNIOWZuUWtIeE5wa3RCUi1RZVVaOHA0eG1xUUJLaGtzTVU9

unfortunately ds only makes sense as a masters degree or a minor for ds to be useful there must be a strong understanding of the area in which the methodologies are being applied i know many people that graduated from undergrad ds programs and am not happy with how their curriculum was structured in my opinion a ds course should be mandatory for more or less every major along with your basic stats course that would not only make the ds coursework more valuable but it would also encourage students to take additional quantitative coursework if i were you i would major in bio or chem and take a ds course or two in your final year to prep you for the job market or grad school,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1SnFsMTRNeVY4VE9LYmRSdkZfLWxKWU9jbmZQRFU4U2VYamJLbDByNXJPR0VxU0d3emQ1QW43a1hkMF9xblZDM3BySTdxYjMwMExIeU15OGY1LWZlX2pBTERFTnQwN2FJZng1dkoybDVfUDA9

hey i am one of those business graduates who are looking into transitioning to data science through bootcamp i managed to get an entry level job in data analysis a lot of sql and data viz and i am contemplating insisting on my pursuit of data science the more i learn about ds the more i feel intimidated tho especially because of the jokes about ds new entrants are either phd in bioengineering or bootcamp graduates  are there a lot of cases where people from outside of stem successfully transition to ds field the reason why i still contemplate is because i still believe that we can use ai for sustainability and for good so i would really love the chance to participate in these efforts that being said maybe a junior level skillset is not very useful for that also if you have any opinion on that please share thank you,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1dEFIbm9ZSk5KU3RyYmgyVzQxOXFCM2NkWDVzbkRfZTIzQ3dmQVdKRFNXZi10VWp6Z0w2cnprMUcyXzNqdnRSclVGQnR3Wi1JUTNJNDV4cG5SWDlxY1E9PQ==

not exactly statistics related but i participated in a hackathon once i was getting into data science at the time and there was a more experienced ds as well on the team i had to keep explaining to him that we have to make sure one of the columns didnt have information that was collected after the event we were trying to predict or it would be sort of data leakage he repeated a few times that it was ok it didnt matter because xgb can check which features are the most important and if this particular column wasnt important the model would simply not use it as much and it seemed like he used xgb for everything,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TWkzVmVsQi1ua1d1bTRIVDJPWm1lZG1xNnVHckVBOEdocy1yTDA3eWdUUkpwMXFSQlk2ejI4azA0WXl4bnVGQ0J4a1o3LUx2eDFQOXMwcUlzbVhZc3c9PQ==

all loan underwriting processes seek to determine if the applicant will successfully complete the term of the loan without exposing the lender to loss literally this is what the credit score seeks to do as do many other models out there that aim to avoid traditional credit scoring to avoid regulations surrounding loan underwriting if your model is to be used for loan underwriting it must do so within your countries lending industry regulations,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZEp3XzloTVhDX1BhSHZ3LUljengzYW91Y2ROQ2NNQ0lmZXpwUEhUVnQ1NnJDTk50VGRpUUJKMS1kUTdnUHlZY1dIWks3NDRrbWpKVVNwQ3RBMVFaS2c9PQ==

i think the question is how can i calculate a treatment effect of a variable after controlling for other variables a method thats popular is double ml based on this paper<url> it allows you to calculate treatment effects of a variable your event after accounting for explanatory variables other events that might have changed between versions its also fairly simple to implement in python im still getting to grips with how to use this method appropriately though and ive seen both intuitive and funky results so if you do end up using it let me know how it goes you might already be familiar with causal inference but in case youre not causal inference for the brave and true<url> is a resource that many folks on this sub reddit recommend good luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1N0FkRWI4Y2tlLVFveWhYcUlIdHVxanFrYXFiaXRseUtxa09lNTBJS3JxSm1iNjlRekhyOU93SjFqQjlJbHFpTGp3cU0yOVpPdWx0Z3VpVi13LVNyRm1oTmFNZThON29QVVdzSnNtU2tCemc9
projects are how i learned too so agree with the advice the one area where i found this approach difficult was experimentation while you can find a data set and practice prediction or inference its difficult to practice experimentation outside of a company i think simple ab testing follows a straightforward process which is described well here<url> easy to learn hard to practice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1b2d2LVhJdklISnlKUDdVSVNVX2htSUpvWXJwWWpmVXVQZGhobjMtcjNra0xqTmZzWi13TjEzaGUySi1mNUlUekhoc05zS2FLeGl1eHU5R1ZHMFZWTFhPbVNhbG96ZEcwdWNua25ZRlhiTE09

something light i once had a job interview that asked me to do sentiment analysis and report back i was told to spend around <number> hours on it and i could take my time sleeping on the problem before getting started take home assignments like this are my favorite because i get to comfortably show real work i put the sentiment analysis job interview project on github after that every company i interviewed with including every recruiter asked me about it thinking it was the coolest thing as if it was some major project i had done i was honest and told them it was a job interview project so it was basic sentiment analysis from a library not anything too complex this didnt matter because by this point they were already interested in me that single job interview project helped me get my foot in the door for many interviews after that ironically ive done some really cool personal projects and none of them caught anyones attention its the small scale stuff everyone takes notice in in <number> when i got my first ds job the company interviewed me because i was listed as a maintainer of pfsense a popular router software all that i had done was fixed a single line of code because the maintainer of that part of the codebase had been mia for <number> years and the bug had a large influence on my network this gave tremendous credit but it was just a one line change that took <number> minutes to do speaking of bug fixes this one video game company gave me access to their source code to show off im not a gamer and i run linux at home so i modified fixed their makefile so that it could build and run on linux upon them finding out they bypassed all of the interviews they planned for me and sat me down with the lead dev of the company asking for me to personally work under him im a ds that does analysis and pattern matching i dont want to do swe work so ofc i turned them down i guess they just hyper honed in on that one part,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R1BiV1dHSllEU2l1cTktQ2lPdDZRTnp1cFNlZzMwUUtXMzVGYy1QQmFLR0ZnT0NHM2xDbWJxaEFQVEdfYXJPRzZlMTgzU2dJNTBGMmhhaW1PRUw5bWc9PQ==

upowerfultiger gives good suggestions just wanted to clarify this is indeed causal inference based on observational data because for whatever reason you cannot use the gold standard of ab test causal inference and even more so when done on observational data requires much more than the model or the data so before jumping onto the modelling part id suggest the op some hints <number> establish both plausibility and the path by which the specific event causes the engagement is it directly or through some other mechanism read up on bradford hills causality criteria a bit dated and somewhat coarse but useful nonetheless <number> you must learn the difference between colliders mediation and confounders otherwise youre at risk of doing silly models <number> use dags to help sketch <number> and <number> i mean real dags not a bunch of arrows lol <number> you dont have to use pure ml model for this theres a huge body of literature from epidemiology biostatistics and econometrics indeed one of the last nobel prize in economics was awarded for this type of problems propensity score matching im not a fan just illustrative of the vast body of work was developed in the early <number>s i suppose that if this is a game you should have an easier time to isolate a possible causal link because presumably in a game hard rules are known ahead of time,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ckVZZy1TZDhEbENCOS1VQTdqdEdpNmg3U21ZdGVZZjUzUHhDX2VfQ09YcHdETWc4ajNkUFdPa19sY3JySGpfMjlwajRvQ0Q0U0FEOVJaMWlndVdZU3c9PQ==

people are usually let go soon after hiring due to bad organisational fit the interview process even after many rounds can not fully uncover all facets of an applicants personality and most usually its how they fit in the team and colleagues across the organisation its usually in my experience where theyve not gelled with the organisation a guiding word here or there from a manager can help but if they head into a meeting early on telling management how the company has been doing everything all wrong then they will be out pretty fast,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1bFFDNGc0aTdiNThTTVNZTzNVYXU3ZFRGSVZPMkE1Yk9oLW5XZ1RJbHhyTDBtMzJXbkNidW1KbDhWT2FfU1NxelptVGQzT1VwdHJJUnhxSTgyNGkweUE9PQ==

clearly the interview process does not produce results with roc auc of <number> therefore the interview process is not fully capable of identifying the optimal candidate and that assumes each instance of collecting applicants has full access to the entire pool of employees employed or otherwise it does not a business seeks to maximize profit there is likely a diminishing return to further expanding the candidate review process in terms of resultant employee profitability in human terms a company can only hire from the people it can access it cannot hire people it cannot access timing weather location all play a part a perfect candidate may have eaten a bad hot dog for lunch and bombed the air interview a perfect candidate may be interviewed by a panel who ate a bad hot dog for lunch and was subsequently viewed in less than perfect light considering the diminishing returns its probably easier and cheaper to hire and fire than to spend months or years fretting over the unknowns of a specific candidates projected quality especially when doing tech developments that require first to market results to be competitive then consider all the other factors that may influence a company to hire and fire top of mind is when a company pays the majority of comp in equity that is forfeited in some part when an employee is terminated suddenly one can attract the best talent by hanging a shiny golden carrot in front of them then yank it away right as they cross the finish line with a pip and termination then lets also consider firms with hire fire notoriety also tend to align with stack rank culture if a manager has a solid team but is required to stack rank and drop bottom <number> they may just make some sacrificial hires throughout the year who will be pipd and fired then the manager gets to keep the core team intact,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NGozMzB6VUN5S2hWV2R3Snh4NkhxNnpIczZraEwwNDlQRTBFMTM0Y2VQMmtXQXZQVTZJcmtLNnVhYTJUU3l3NzhEcmgyWmpkcDhiQnZ1WXo2VDNVeWc9PQ==

an aspect of personal projects that i think is underrated is that youll be able to talk about them during your interviews multiple interviewers asked me to talk about a project i worked on and i was able to use my personal projects to answer those questions sure its unlikely that the recruiter or the hm will actually look at them but it gives you something to talk about i think you should come up with a project that is personal to you that way a little bit of your personality comes through in the response as well for eg the hemingway suggestion someone commented about earlier i did a project that scraped local grocery store sales weekly since i like a good deal good luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1dkFWcFZrNjFXY2U3cGhjU2U2MmNrRGg4NFNGMkxEbmlHYUpDVi15NmEwWGpMSzllVEotN0ktaEJpZllfelltb2s4bGxTUU9Bc2tZSDFtTnQxOEZJRGc9PQ==

this is usually a bad fit for the company and that can mean a lot of things the biggest problem is usually a desperate person being hired by a desperate hiring manager i have seen a manager who burned through <number> people in one position in a year one guy lasted <number> weeks she was the worst micromanager and would talk down to everyone who worked for her and she was a horrible boss she would shittalk the people who worked for her to other managers in front of the people she was talking about i was approached by the guy who had been there for three weeks about two weeks in and asked if he could move to my team i had to let the other manager and my boss know what was going on so that i wouldnt get into the situation but i honestly felt bad for the guy she evidently ripped into him and was very disrespectful and she basically said she was going to pip him out and at that point dude just left the guy she hired about <number> months later left after less than <number> months after she piped him on the other hand ive also fired some people who have clearly lied on their resume we do pre and posthire background checks and i have had to let people go who lied about their last job he said he worked as a manager at a competing company and was a vp there the background check after he was hired came back with him not working there and also not a vp he was a programmer and had been fired from the company almost <number> years earlier i also have had people who just dont want to do what they have to do for the job this field gets a lot of different types of people and they can have personality issues as both management and workers,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZVVzNlFmV0lYQm51SDJnazhlM1o3ZmFDdkczajhYNV90dnlqR283dXdqc0ZPUlVXcG02WHRTZXpxX0J5VDY5dllzVFRFQzJMQk5TZkFsQzVkTnQwWmc9PQ==

this is nice in theory but i come from a biology background and i could not for the life of me get a job involving some more data analysis or modeling despite my experience and knowledge in those areas everyone says this but nobody will tell you how to get the job without the degree data science degree it is from a top university not a diploma mill,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1bVhzQWxKY3pFQVlMaV94ZEd2SFBtbmlnRTk1V1hFdDd5NGw2Qi05RGt5SFA2Q1laRF83VGJTSXJvNVV2Szh0VFJjWDE3aU1MVmNuNWZkQ1cwb2xMTDRndUdsYWFSMlVVaXczTkNUY3pxSUE9
my current role was created for me specifically id been working in internal audit or other riskcontrol roles at financial institutions for around <number> years id been with my current employer for a few years in the audit department on the audit practices team and was there while i worked on my masters about the time i finished my masters i actually put a model into production that caught the caes attention and he decided he wanted me working directly for him at that point my current role varies a lot from day to day but i would say is very heavy on data science knowledge but at best <number> of my time is doing hands on data science work i basically have four primary focuses advise the cae and audit executives on subject matter and best practices lately this has been lots of conversations about what ai can and cant do low hanging fruit for quick integration and adaption of ai into current processes i also do a lot of advising on how audit should be covering model risk from the strategic level on where it fits in our risk assessment to the tactical level of test procedures when models are involved in processes this is around <number> of my time root cause analysis and predictive analytics around strategic decisions this tends to be ad hoc analysis around policy or procedure changes to help support large decisions for example we recently made some policy updates and the cae had me do some analysis on how the changes would impact hours budgets for audits and issue validations i spun up a few regression models and estimated the effects on hours budgets in the different scenarios this is probably <number> of my time i occasionally get to build actual models that go into production recently i built a model that clustered audit issues and then had a dashboard for each cluster to show why the issues were clustered and visualize how the issues in the cluster affect the enterprise and the severity of the issues its reviewed by a user to identify thematic issues previously someone used to read every single issue and try and manually identify themes i dont get to do this often maybe <number> of my time the remaining <number> of my time is just data analyst type work cae or some executive wants a report and i go pull the data and build some pretty charts i try and push back on this work by educating my leaders that this is an underutilization of my abilities and by teaching others how to do this work so they can instead be assigned this work that said sometimes it just needs to get done so it falls on me to do it theres definitely a lot of positions out there that are just businessdata analyst type roles with a data science title unfortunately theres no consistency across companies or even within them on this it really comes down to the knowledge of the hiring manager on what data science actually is in order to avoid those roles you really have to be careful to question the hiring manager on what the deliverables are for the role during the interview process,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YlFjaHVsQkNyZzd6VjJ6eTh5em4tazFaWm96NFpsWEEzeDlxUjdPa2kzQnFqQnFOWFFTdklUeDFPenJqSml5T1pjdWJVLVU0U0VfMnV1bm1uTEhVd2c9PQ==

tech contractor for almost <number> years most companies have no idea what to do with tech contractors while being technically proficient most of my managers were non technical people who didnt know how to utilize my time and skills properly or even do their job properly it was a lot better <number> years ago when i could be in the office and explain in great detail why i am right and they are wrong but now everything is remote and there is a lot less authority in a skype call zoom whatever <number> years ago they were also a lot more lenient with contractors letting us have more control over how we do our jobs and company perks meetings etc but since it is against labor laws for temp workers to do full time work were mostly relegated to justify their team budget like i get it i didnt like being taken advantage of being paid <number><number> of what full timers got paid while doing the same level of work as them but on the other hand at least i had a nice resume and can get a better next job my current resume looks like im more like an intern program manager than data,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1U0FVdXN1ZE5nZTdQY2xYam1mRG9xVm1fcmRRYTR5V0xKa1J2aV9IeHpJcFVxNlVhR1YydzRxX3BmU0V2VUJZLVV5TVU0Z3ZlbUJ1RzNIZFdRc250SHc9PQ==

this scares me to know people are doing this then again when i was a baby analyst for a firm <number>something years ago we had a md who would come in and correct a few financial models he would present to clients where im almost certain he worked backward from the conclusion he wanted to present and then cleaned up outliers to help his hypothesis one time i think he ended up trimming a model to about <number> data points and i was too youngdumbscared to lose my job to know better thankfully i moved to a different firm not long after that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1VVdSRXBaU05HendzeGZ6Zk1aRW1nWDZMNmptWl9HT2EwaGxtcmNYbmRrTFNGM2tCaUhDVTM2QjFrZjB3Y0p2bU1meVZRUHJkMGp3bGZBdVRSRmNDdkE9PQ==

try to retrain the model on the same data with the same hyperparameters and the same machines i believe youll encounter the same scenario the local minima that is obtained when you train your model would be different for every new model you create that could be why your output is similar but not an exact replica instead do hyperparameter tuning etc and choose the model you like the most then import it into different instances of using it instead of retraining the model if possible that could be one solution,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1cHhYOERoQUQyU0FaMWp0eWlSQUdHeDlOMTJ0eEZJaF8tNXIzOGhRQ3l6Z3gtLVQ3bkcxWi1DdDNVYXRIbW9PbGVRZHlkUjFtZ0FnLUc5VDU0LThSS0E9PQ==
thanks for the input i think youre right that im arriving at slightly different local minima each run and i think its probably with hdbscan and thats the cause of the issue the umap scatter plot looks the same across runs aside from being rotated bc the x and y axes are flipped sometimes ive basically taken the approach you described by just tuning and saving the model i like to load into python later but something about the approach feels wrong to me like the local minima are different enough that the research conclusions would vary a bit between runs for example i cannot even confidently say what the three most frequent topics are because they switch a little bit each run maybe some data are just not suited for topic modeling or for projects that need reproducible topics you still need to use some ldabased approach,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZEhSUlpuYXBYZ0JvXzlDbGtKOEJJWDd3WTZ2UjBLYWpxZ2JMWDVpRzB5YnpYMlpsSElLZVZ4OHdyVlFyMDlieXdfak1OQjY2OUNzSFI2YXUydm1RYmhKWmRIeFBQbllkcWNuTUZkdnBERVE9

i have a different view from you about why the conclusion isnt consistent it could be possible that the data inherently has <number><number> topics that are nearly equally prevalent so while their ranking might shift due from second to third for example the margin by which they do is so small that a slight change in model will cause it to assign topic <number> a value of <number> and <number> <number> while an earlier model gave topic <number> a value of <number> and topic <number> <number> resulting in a change in ranking we underestimate the variety and complexity of text data especially once it crosses a certain length its rare to have clearly separated consistently reproducible topics and themes the edge cases will always be present in this case lda too will yield you a similar result bertopic did the data complexity could be causing the issue in which case the model type you chose will not be able to mitigate it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R1VnN2tYLWVZaGRrY0VFU0xVYS1SUTREci1NOHpfNHBFSUdQcHFnRk9zeUVSQlMyM29kQmkyS2toUlZwX3lYUkNPb1VsNTFPZk1VOVhQbGJrTGdUUGc9PQ==

their docs specifically talk about reproducibility but thats in the context of running inference on the same model not for retraining it it concerns me a bit that saving that model to use later doesnt feel right to you thats what you do fam you train a model save it then load it up and use it for inference you dont train a model fresh before doing inference every time,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ODQzUjFIaG1oT1NLbmNjTzFpaFpVWG5RTy1GdU5mZy0xbFdjUjBXWmVqNk9ZalpJdGZ0MFF2Y2IyallxR3VDeTlxNGcwMmlTNkRINjZPOXVPNXVHNmhGRnlHS1dKTzFUa2MxWnlyZ0RBRlU9

hiring lots of contractors seems to make no sense in most cases the company is paying more than for an equivalent fte and the contractor is less motivated to do quality work because its going to be someone elses problem soon i think in most cases its a sort of workaround for the companys own bureaucracy or internal politics that makes hiring full time employees difficult,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1VVY3elgtQV9SajVEdjlpRERVdTg5YWhkRWJyU19waGdiVzI4ZlZ1c3liVE8yZEtQc3JqakNYejVQSHpqY2lNM0U2eHNOa2FOaVRzbWtDQWV6bEVPWVE9PQ==

the company is paying more than for an equivalent fte not necessarily once you consider costs of benefits hiring training etc general rule is that a fte costs <number> to <number> of their cash compensation with a contractor at least the expense is all wrapped up into their pay the contractor is less motivated to do quality work because its going to be someone elses problem soon questionable assertion and if you think that the someone elses problem syndrome isnt present in ftes then youve been very fortunate i lead a small consulting group we get hired because we have specialty skills and can work quickly on a specific problem and when were done were gone no piping no coaching just thank you for your service it doesnt mean we dont give a crap about the work quality in fact its quite the opposite because my business viability depends upon quality work it just means we arent there for years,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YkVvV3lHRGw0UWk0UGJuWDRBOGY3dXB4OXF5amp6VTZXSno3NExuTVBOaWV3OEpDcnp6Wi03ZGRjOV9Lc3NIc01KV19fOHlHNFVkRVhtM0lZaTByamlVY2NwQUROd2ZDU2lpbHUycUczUEE9

well you can use linear its s till going to find a way to fit but i believe a non monotonous function would fit the latlong features better i suspect though i dont know it for sure that these features would rather hinder the performance of the linear model than improve it eta anyways my gut is irrelevant the appropriate way would be to visualize features separately against the target in order to tailor your model choice,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Ym5CUnh4Tno3Y2hLT2IyR0I3SGRLUWJZcm1NbXdwNHVmeHRzMUgwU3I4b1ZjSDZrYU5CMndxQkVkaVpXMV9kQXI2T2Rud1FWcUR6U0VWampUazlicnc9PQ==

its similar but different in social sciences you assume the evidence youre seeing is biased or has its own perspective true use of the scientific method is bring as unbiased as possible in social sciences youre writing an argument the scientific method is describing as precisely as possible the experiment and the results so its repeatable theres for sure overlap and theres obviously a place for the scientific method in data science,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1REl6WnZIY0pEUTNzWDJ0bUlzSW5LSEJYZVVRcGl2Umh1UjBNaWxnNV9NTHBKNWhkMnU2R2NKRWQ0ZkFJd0V2eHU1U2JCUFBYbFIwYUJ6MWItMmluaVEyWnBjdzk1RjQtbDd3UGlqLW9PR0k9

just my two cents but ive made similar requests of candidates but never would i expect them to actually turnaround working projects in such a short period of time thats unreasonable ive asked for a quick presentation on how they might do something if given the time and resources with that said maybe just come up with a couple of notebooks to demo how you might approach a project using llms for sentiment analysis of novels and use one or two as an example,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YTI0R1VNbFhON0dVR2hQNjg1RXVWUUpfZ0dxcGRkS29lbDRCY01KX1lMLWJqT2hWVGtqRlFSSld4a3lTLXJxalhvQ29PYjZXZUtYaUVkTlRKZkY5b1E9PQ==

have exactly the same issue as you or better started having it the moment i started using bertopic in the cloud and changing the specs of my compute instance didnt notice it as long as i worked on prem tried keeping all hyperparameters constant setting seeds even tried saving a model loading it and running inference on the same data it was trained but reproductibility has been a constant pain after investigating what i was told is that the moment you deal with gpus and your hardware changes reproductibility becomes harder at least for clustering use cases like bertopic,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1QldVSlIxbzd4N1p4U2dBbmFPazhCb29EQjFXZHNzaUdHU2JhREJWbFpXR1RvZmhXTVVtSTFXdHNRa0xpRFhnYV9MQnlPS0NPN0x0b0w5NWtUbTRhYkE9PQ==

fit is a training step which may or may not be deterministic depending on the model bertopic is at its heart a clustering algorithm and training clustering algorithms are generally nondeterministic kmeans clustering isnt deterministic in this way either there may be deterministic clustering algorithms i dont know but generally i dont expect them to be clustering algorithms often provide a fittransform convenience method but it is fitting the model and performing inference at the same time with many but not all clustering methods you can fit save the model and use transform on new data points to classify your new data point into the closest cluster from your training run then your clusters wont change for new datapoints umap also is also a source of randomness in bertopic as they describe in their best practices document<url> from umap import umap umapmodel = umapnneighbors=<number> ncomponents=<number> mindist=<number> metric=cosine randomstate=<number> i suspect this is the source of your complaint youre getting different clusters each time you run fit you need to seed its random state with a static value to get deterministic behavior i typically use a bash command to get a random seed that i stick into a variable at the top of my notebook,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1MG1uZkpMbTQ1QXRfYXlkYm9UR1RYZDRwaUFwS0FtaXB1VTlPY0xJdm9pTERhLVRqZ2hOTVl1T3ByVUlsNDlRZVBCTk5rLWlTSWJNdkRqZ0R6T3EtWnI1VnRwT0U2bDh0Qnh1ZkpPS0R3bVk9

they definitely dont pay more than amazon over here if i include esops and such their base pay would be marginally lower than amazon of this im not very sure but its realistic my goal is to get to fly out internationally on company dime and maybe a chance at relocation to useu mbb consulting seems good for that i would guess,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2R2N5WHpWU3BmMTlYMnppZmFES2R5MFh4RmtpdmQ3UTZuY0tvVjU0bG9aYVFiZzVyU1IwR3FxRHRRcDlaTG5QTVJvdGxuSXVNTUpJZVVKMWxBRHdIZ01GS3lSM1NrWFV1UFo4UnUyYmJ3V0E9

i had the initial call with their recruiter who told me that theyre working on designing a new coding test and would schedule the round next week took him <number> month just to get the first round scheduled since i was already on notice period i had to decline as the process seemed really excessive plus it could have easily taken ~<number> months,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2bXdKbWlVZ0NySFFYSVVPdjJvM081TTdNUFU4SWxwMG90U2Z0OWpGbzYxalFvMUF3dnRKa3dIaVZSMENYelhXcE1HNVBscG9EOERLWGRWMnJfV2I1Rmc9PQ==
my recruiter was more prompt in scheduling in within <number> days but he indicated that all the interviews would take place over a <number> month period and hence im having mixed feelings about the whole thing since i think id do better to apply to amazon once my cool down period expires since itd pay better have more interesting work and look good on my resume,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZWk5Y3p0WVY0bUpGNS1fLVBPaXhSTDZ4aVdZRjc2UmNGN1FzTzBvY0JaSkctZExEQjZnOGRaYTJtVy15MFB5MFRnZGFnV3MxSW1iVTgxOVF6OXFLZTgwVGYwYnZkc3lIN0ZyZFJBbXRtSVU9

as a data scientist who was educated with master program in the us and now taking management role in terms of data science in vietnam i have to say the hiring process especially for higher level such as senior staffs or even managers was evaluated by business persons who just read some overmarketing magazines and overevaluate the data scientist like data scientists can do every thing it is similar to the thought that ai can do every things now just by an inquiry just like chatgpt in some aspect we cannot deny the capabilities of chatgpt or genai however they seem far to fulfil the imaginary thoughts of the business persons likewise data scientists have their own capabilities but being magically supposed to fulfil the requirements as a data engineer business analyst solution architecture so the hiring biases are not simply due to data scientists themselves its also from the business as well,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WTR3OUVyNU5IaElKZUZQUEt3d2VCS3VxajVISWkxUGtES1pMM3NDRUZIVXdVMHVpNkFna3ZqaURfS2JUNUVsR0FHUzBWVDRWVTBKdmFjcVR5bnpwWEE9PQ==

im a hiring manager not a recruiter recruiters dont know or understand shit if we are honest they are chunking everything including the kitchen sink at an opening to get their metrics filled honestly right now you are pretty screwed if you are hoping to get a job with only your undergrad projects your projects should get you internships and your internship gets you a job or you get a job in industry and your experience in the industry gets you a job maybe you go undergrad to grad school and never have an internship and your grad school projects get you a job but if we are all being really honest most schoolwork doesnt do enough to make you a great candidate especially when good jobs and even semidecent jobs are getting overwhelmed with responses by people who have industry experience or much more data experience not to be mean but why would i pick someone who took who knows how long to build a model that takes who knows how much from someone elseto show me something about a field i have absolutely no idea how insightful the information is and how accurate it works when i have <number> guys who have a minimum of <number> years in the industry andor <number> years of data experience those people might be coming from another school and just finished working in a data program but their prior industry experience is going to trump you here is my biggest challenge hiring a noexperience candidate i dont even know if you know how to adult yet its too hard for me to try and teach you what my industry has to show you and teach you how realworld data works and make sure that you are not going to screw up as a person fresh into the professional world <number> years ago i might take a cs major and give him a shot but now there are a significant number of people who are boomeranging back to school for data and they come with industry experience that person has half the amount of training needed as you the person who was in xyz industry doing data and now wants to work in data in mine only has to learn the industry the next person i am looking for is going to come with an internship under their belt and they can at least show me they have done some production work they hopefully can run some sql queries maybe knows a new toy i dont know but want if you still have time i recommend getting an internship and leveraging that into a job its your fastest way into a perm role if that doesnt work out you should be looking for a substantial experience role in the industry you want to work in i highly recommend if you dont have a financial background looking at jr nonfinancial auditor jobs in the industry you want to work for its not super easy to get those jobs right now as well but its easier those are boot camp jobs that will teach every aspect of the industry there is a downside to this expect to see some traveling if you have a financial or accounting background the financial internal audit positions are great as well and are highvisibility roles near the people who you need to network with i am in the finance food chain and id pick an auditor in my company to move to a data role before i would pick an outsider with only college projects tldr go get a job in audit and work your way over or get an internship and try to find a solution that way,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2S2ttdURtZFFtaDg1RHRDbW1ncm1rMDdFMnNzdHdZdDhMMTRvRDlJWkdmaU50XzlWOEJMcHRPOTlCZXRycWtiQzZpUTZJaXJjWEF5amZWN0xhUnNiTUE9PQ==

its a grind thats for sure mainly because a lot of peoples inboxes are flooded daily with sales folks or people trying to sell career coaching however there are some things you can do if there is a role or a company i like first thing i do is see if anyone there attended one of the schools i did so i can use that as a bridge to the conversation if schools doesnt work i look for someone that served in the same army unit as me or a similar one if i cant find any of those i go look for someone at a more senior role in the department i want to apply for and send them a message basically just expressing my interest in the company or industry i do not mention any open roles and would love to hear how they ended up there and if they have any guidance or advice its a great thing to do when you are overwhelmed applying for jobs it gives you something to do that can help make progress,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2anJTd2RQblFZMkNKaG50ZHFCQnNVS0pXcXRxU21CQ3p6WWxJOTlMUjVlSTQweFRqOXFSYXRPcXROVVFIaW8ycmR5NVBjdjNMWkkxa2ljaGJYTHNnMjY4ekxhN1Nqa0dXUnFFNmtpX3lySjQ9

hello im currently working on my master thesis and im looking for some inputs for the following situation i have data of <number><number> sensors all measuring the same variable at <number><number> different locations in minsinterval =<number> obsday so i expect all measurements to be almost the same if same location or relatively similar if different location in my thesis i introduced an approachalgorithm which performs anomaly detection using pairwise regression of sensor data of same location and in my opinion smart tracking of the coefficients and it seems to perform quite alright evaluation is done using artificial errors which have been added in collaboration with domain experts since generally no ground truth is available an error always affects only one sensor but its possible that multiple errors are active at the same time independently while i definitely appreciate your comments about this this should not be the main point of my post for scientific reasons i need <number><number> other techniques to compare my approach to which is why im asking for your advice here generally it would be nice to have fundamentally different approaches eg my algorithm with regression something dlbased something completely different but this is not too important i only need a way for a scientific and objective comparison since the method described above should be the main focus of the work the additional methods should not be super much work i have <number> fulltimemonths left so i can and will definitely implement sophisticated approaches and do not need to take something out of the box in case that exists but implementing the other methods should not be another master thesis i was looking into matrix profile <url><url> since it seems to be a quite promising technique however its main focus points seem to be univariate time series and my problem needs to be considered multivariate since the behavior of the data can change quite a lot which is fine if they all show the same i tried applying mp to one single sensor data and it only found the most obvious errors and also many false positives there are some papers about extending to multivariate case eg<url><url> but it does not seem to be very fitting in my situation where errors usually only show on one sensor not on k out of n so i dont really know how to best apply mp in this case beside that i thought about deep learning based approaches and found daemon <url><url> and usad <url><url> however they seem to be quite experimental and i dont want to spend weeks to rebuild a nn from the written description not knowing if it is even suitable in my case so i would be really grateful for recommendations of methods or other advices for my situation and feel free to ask if something about my problem description is unclear thanks a lot,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2LTRHamdyME9tSm5CNXRSaVd5d2xJeFh2YzVObVBuOWh5QVFlR2NXdmhBVFlYTlc3emZaQmkxQ1pBRG1kZ0J1dkhJTWpTWUhQY2RIQ2tQdUhSV2wtdnc9PQ==

multivariate regression models will not solve the issue of variables influencing each other or being statistically significant in most cases the model output will tell you through the ftest that at least one variable is not statistically significant but as i said before highly correlated variables can influence each other to the point that one variable becomes more significant than it should be so to truly know if each variable is significant or not a two tailed ttest is what you need to run independently of each variable also if you have highly correlated significant variables you need to combine them,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WEt2dXhlc3ljT3F4ZktqdDA3RmppN0lFWDcwWVlNcWpNczUzRGcxWUpPOW1xcnRabEJhMVlNR0drbldwRHVoeU5HV0J2VkRwWEljYmJGU3JWaXpHbFE9PQ==
when modeling coffee shop sales to automate ordering its essential to account for the timeseries effect rather than limiting your data to a specific time frame using a longer time frame like one year helps capture seasonal trends and patterns that are crucial for accurate forecasting to handle seasonal effects you can use dummy variables for each season or month additionally incorporating fourier terms or a seasonal decomposition of time series can effectively model seasonality another approach is using timeseries models like sarima or machine learning models like boosting that can include datebased features,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VkpVQUFaWTYxOGlUcjZWRFhhT09rekdfUXp4V204Mk9ncEVoWUg5VWlJdHFIaW1MbW1BUWJiZXV5WXFpQjcxaG84ZHB2OXpvbktyMFFnYWtlUjc0eXc9PQ==
to determine the engagement uplift driven by a specific event in a game without ab testing you could consider using timeseries analysis to observe engagement patterns before during and after the event one approach is the interrupted time series analysis which can help identify changes in engagement levels attributable to the event additionally you can use regression models with engagement as the dependent variable and the event as an independent variable controlling for other factors to estimate the potential uplift from adding more events you could use a predictive model like arima or a machine learning model like a random forest that includes the event occurrence as a feature this would help simulate scenarios with varying frequencies of events to project their impact on engagement,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2YUh6d0x0bGtnWkM5TVVQTzVCejk5MV9RVW55R18wbmJ5VmhDcDdJelotM1R5RW5CNVlRZ3V0Z3A0RkZvMW5HdTFkYUxnTTFPamJBZTJfekZUZDdPb2c9PQ==

yes you can keep na values when building a machine learning model and the information from other columns can still be useful however not all models can handle na values directly algorithms like decision trees and their ensemble methods eg random forest can manage na values better as they can treat them as a separate category for other models like you might need to encode na values differently such as using a specific value like <number> or creating an additional binary indicator column to denote the presence of na values sometimes na values themselves can carry important information and can be beneficial for the model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SzhwdWZlQzNYMDVlOXA5TnBDX0dqOU5YbFc0MS1sNGJNbjFCVVFSeVZEWEktY29kaHdseHh4aHBLYklKMGVra2ZjRk90YnpaZU0wQWpxeHRtQklYdmc9PQ==

the job market for data roles in <number> is tough but certain skills are in high demand with your experience you should definitely improve your python skills and continue the machine learning course employers often look for people who can deploy models into production so focus on that etl skills and experience with cloud platforms like aws or azure would be great too your advanced excel and tableau skills are already topnotch but these new skills could help you find better and higherpaying jobs,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2OTJGTTl0dktERXg1di1BYWpZb1F5WlNRME1LV0pRbzgzaEFmWTVBWWo1azhtZkNmeFpPZG5EZzNjR3VSN05ZTUZ5aUlwX2VROUFxYmVhcTRjQm5IRkE9PQ==
thats the goal of double ml dml or double robust learner from econml i would look up how those models work and get applied ill explain it briefly dml fits two models one to predict the outcome say revenue from a user in the next x days based on controls user attributes behavior etc calculate residuals yres second to predict the assignment of the treatment from those same controls residuals tres you fit a new model yhat = theta that this is typically called inverse propensity weighting when your treatment is binary theta from this regression is the conditional average treatment effect which accounts for the fact that your promotion was not randomly assigned this is not a perfect methodology but it is one of the best or if not the best ways to still get confident estimates of effects despite not being able to run an rct,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2NzRldUZVSjI5MklJNUVKX083SkIzS1ladER6NXd0d3Y3YndJSk54Wi1YNG0xQmVlamFCd1ZQWl9BdFhTTGJCMFJoODBiTzdHM2dsZ3dxTURWNkZjRkE9PQ==
in data science python and sql are definitely the goto languages but cc++ can be useful too theyre often used for performanceintensive tasks because they run faster than python for example some machine learning libraries and highfrequency trading systems use cc++ for speed if you have spare time learning cc++ can make you more versatile and might open up more job opportunities especially in roles where performance optimization is key,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Y3hLSWp0dkdpMlh4MmFtRW1TV3pzUDdldWZfZzdJdDRnTjRVMmxwYWxuV0JLdHNsT1pqSDhSVjh5cEkwc3VhWVVtVWtVT2ZTSkd0VnJpN2VUQWthQ0E9PQ==

most companies outside of big players like faang typically dont build large language models llms from scratch due to the immense resources required instead they focus on finetuning existing models like bert or gpt to suit their specific needs finetuning allows them to leverage the power of these advanced models while tailoring them to their unique applications so having experience with finetuning and applying pretrained llms is generally whats expected in many job postings,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Z1R2Ym1WZElxWWJjcUxveEJITGJLN3VJRW5lcUZ5R3BSZG9GMTkwNHp6T2M2RWRjSTFxRHNfdXhtRU5NMlQ5TEJxZmVMRVRVTGpSUGFoOHNpSjdiOWc9PQ==

i think what you said of >for me it is that data analysts who are closer to their domains make great data science managers than most data scientists with little to none business understanding happens a lot a lot a lot and i get it domain knowledge can help someone get going on day one but perhaps my counter bias is that a skilled individual with curiosity will almost always catch up and potentially surpass a foundation thats more domain knowledge weighted my own bias then is probably curiosity ive found that curios folks can have major knowledge deficits but still take a problem and run with it whereas otherwise noncurious experts can often end up just punching the clock,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2UVdaeG1ZZnktWjgtcGNlWGwxaVhlRDhlNlFPS05LM1Q2VmpfcWVWSnVJc2xTSV9NQ1Nqd0pWUE1femR6anBvcjI1VVdYSU5ldWNIcVhUZGRhSkJhSWc9PQ==

i couldnt figure out how to pass precalculated embeddings to bertopic didnt try too hard so technically im doing the inefficient thing and vectorizing twice but my data are only ~k short comments so its pretty fast as you mentioned i also think the embeddings are deterministic and not the problem though i also set torch and numpy seeds in both blocks too so the embeddings should be the same even though im doing the dumb thing and vectorizing my text twice i think the answer to my issues is either a not being able to set a seed for hdbscan b differences between machines im running on im using a diff machine a lot bc a cloud service or c inherent complexity and the model just arriving at local minima but even if c then using a clustering algorithm with a random seedstate should solve the problem im going to try it with a gaussian mixture model later today and set the seed in the gmm i think that should reduce the nonreproducibility unless its machinelevel variance edit i also think the issue is just that my data are hard to topic model perhaps and simpler datasets eg with clearer separations between topics will have more stable results,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2X1l5SkgwRmNvRG1iLUcyLXBGeUdBUTBKQktINnd4Y2xlSkFSWkNtS09sVGg5YzR4QnhGeVV5a29JZHQtc25FbzJoeUJ6bUt2SXhIN2FRZ2FJZ1JUZ2ZrZDhPRlZUNmYxbG5sMTdzUFlCZjQ9

this is like opting out of harvard business school because they interview candidates for people who dont have a strong pedigree getting bain on the resume is life changing in the same way that getting harvard or google on the resume is if you have a few faangs on the resume and an elite university on the resume you can probably skip bain consulting companies are meat grinders with poor wlb in most cases but if youre young and want to maximize your career a year or two at bain gives you instant credibility you dont have to prove that youre smart or talented anymore faang will generally pay better but promotions come slower at faangs,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2X3Z1bkkzZGUyWG9ZRmJ4cGM2RzhVMzlickNxdnUxeEpOUnZrNUpPRkI2UFExVmF4MHMzbHc4STdSZDFnYkxzc3J3NjVkY2ZLYlAwdlVySjk3WXNsUEphTGpXcDFrWGNzdkl6R0VyXzhSWU09
lots of good answers but something i would push everyone to clarify before going too far down the techincal discussion rabbit hole what do you mean by promotions and what types of sales promotions mean a lot of different things in every industry like at major cpg companies coca cola pepsifrito lay general mills etc a promotion is normally a broad promotional event that is not targeted to individual consumers but rather to large swaths of consumers so a promotion would be selling a <number>pack of coke for <number> instead of <number> or buy one get one half off etc this may be implemented by market or by channel or by partner eg krogers but its not going to be specific to the individual ie bob gets a <number> promo and sandra gets a <number> promo price promotions at other companies like in bb settings may be literally specific to the customer or in the case of some online services it might be targeted to literally specific people based on their attributes if youre in the first world mmm is going to be more than enough to get the answers that you need because generally you dont need to worry about the decision makerlevel influence of the promotion its more of a temporal thing when was the promo active and coverage which segments were impacted so its fundamentally a macro strategy with macro effect if youre in the second world ie where individuals based on their attributed were presented with specific promotions to try to induce them to buy then everything youre seeing about causal inference becomes a lot more applicable because then you actually need to be very careful about how much of the impact that you saw can be attributed to the fact that you presented a promo to those people vs those people who were not randomly selected being impacted by other exogenous factors,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2c0dRVkZvR3hTdjhYUjFBTXFlZE52clhrVk53VmNXb0F2aHQ1dWdISTMxSmowd2JGMzhXSFZpRnB4Q3h0SnVBRkZhQ0pYVi1JWUpwV25OanNlTWFiLVE9PQ==

couple of thoughts <number> recruiters dont care hiring managers might <number> if you want to impress a hiring manager build an actual thing like ideally build an app that does something that is actual somewhat useful it doesnt have to be broadly useful thats hard but if you can build an app that does something useful for any group of people that will draw some attention the example i always give i like fantasy football if i was going to build something as a personal project it would be a web app that scraped sportsreference or the espn fantasy data and gave you the ability to generate forecasts using a range of simple adjustable methods to compare what those numbers look like depending on what you want to emphasize theres probably all of like <number> people that would care to use this but to those people it would be super cool my point being dont start with an easy dataset and then show off your modeling skills en route to building something no one cares about instead start with something you care about and then make it work <number> instead of spending your summer doing personal projects i would recommend getting any type of job even if not related to ds like literally any type of job starbucks retail store temp job doing data entry stocking stuff waiter whatever why because weirdly enough something that is really valuable of a candidate is them showing that they can work in a standard work environment that they can deal with customers shitty coworkers politics pressure learning things on the fly etc experience as a waiterwaitressretail workerstarbucks probably means youve learned how to talk to people better than the average data scientist youve probably also learned how to work in an actual fastpaced environment another great option tutoring why it shows you know how to teach communiate technical topics the other advantage of a job over a personal project you have to actually work its hard you have to be there on time you have to work on days when you dont feel like working and you have to be good enough to not get fired personal projects = you work whenever you want on whatever you want and no matter how bad you are it doesnt matter as a hiring manager i would rather see a summer job of any kind over a personal project unless its an extremely impressive personal project,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2NG54T3Nkd2dmNW1wdG5OQ2lFeFRLbnEtOHlINENoTlNRdUxYb2NVVmNxellSSFEwdnhPMlRucGhsUUJNM09LU1VmbHZaR1FWd0x4MnJOMEFHV2wyeHc9PQ==

soft skills arent taught in school but they make or break good data scientists stakeholder management is what will determine a good project from bad the majority of the time a book could be written on how to manage a project and its stakeholders but a few important notes are a clarify expectations on timelines up front if a new feature is requested be clear on how that changes timelines b determine what their problem actually is a lot of times they think they need a particular solution cough llms but thats a solutionfocused approach you need to understand the problem then pick an appropriate solution dont be the person searching for nails and dont tolerate those who are conditional on political constraints c determine what if anything they are currently doing to solve the problem that is your benchmark its not can i beat just fitting the sample mean or some other metric were taught in school its can i improve on what they already have if they have nothing then my view is anything worth doing is worth doing badly although there are times where no solution is better for sure a simpler interpretable quicker solution beats a slower difficult to interpret slow solution almost always simpler solutions are also easier to maintain boosting will be as good as a neural net on tabular data basically always linear models with a good understanding of interactions will be as good as boosting frequently get it in writing quadruple check for data leakage you have it you dont think you do but you do ask for help get others opinions when youre stumped or uncertain and dont be afraid to say you dont know something help your team too be careful when suggesting alternatives to a current solution in the org chances are youll be implementing itinvolved if you suggest it keep an eye towards production always your solution is only a fraction of what has to be done and it has to interface with other things its best to think about those things ahead of time to save you some headache later have a rollout plan fixing bugs in prod a day after launch is a pain having a rollout plan can smooth these things over a lot,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZXlNV21hLUFlczJueUhPZ2ozc01VdUFvZHotdlVnLXBCUDZlOGdLTURieXJkUW9MdnY1NVQ3V2ZlZ1ctcnVQN3djT0JoZFlLZzYwUUxLM2x4VlMwbXc9PQ==

i was the same way at first then after a few years of corporate bs everything blends into each other and it really does just feel like a job for example taking extra care to write elegant and maintainable code only to be thrown into a project at the last minute where the entire codebase is a mess because other people on the team have no idea what theyre doing spending hours creating a visually stunning dashboard that is both concise and informative only for it to be held up by a low level corporate goon who decides it doesnt meet accessibility guidelines and then refuses to sign off and launch it middle management never being able to agree on anything and then deciding at the last minute that project youve been working on for the last <number> months is no longer in scope and will be on hold for the foreseeable future while they reassign you to work on some stupid shit with no business value at all etc,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2aGV5RnkxdWNVR2U1YUI2bG5saEw0NTc1U05POGtwNkN6VFVFN2RPRC02b1VXX04wMGFIdEdtQnRlU0ZyXzNKSV84SGpUR0dsUXhHdy04cV8xTWIzbGc9PQ==

its ok for it to just be a job as long as it fulfilling it is very demotivating to work with people who are not passionate or care about how and why technology works too often we make a separation in our livesthere is work and there is life outside work where we find real pleasure and fulfillment work is often seen as a means for making money so we can enjoy that second life that we lead even if we derive some satisfaction from our careers we still tend to compartmentalize our lives in this way this is a depressing attitude because in the end we spend a substantial part of our waking life at work if we experience this time as something to get through on the way to real pleasure then our hours at work represent a tragic waste of the short time we have to live robert greene mastery,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2YVY5cGJDTnB2VnBWclh3bzRaTkpXUlU1U3p5LVNKbFdsTUw2ZWhfcUp1c2ZBM055X0lGMjRUUDFBWVAtVGh1WlFHNmlBMXhCU09FamxFWEQ1SlZCOVE9PQ==

im having difficulty understanding where my experience and knowledge fits into this saturated job market i recently graduated from a masters in data science and artificial intelligence with almost <number> years prior experience in fpa and corporate finance i moved from analyst > sr analyst > manager before i decided to pivot careers i loved the adhoc analysis in fpa primarily because it involved diverse problems to tackle and learn from it often involved significant modeling in excel and development of business acumen and on the very rare occasion where it involved statistics or sql coding i enjoyed it thoroughly however i strongly disliked the crux of fpa work which revolved around the monthlyquarterly close monotony and small generic financial data sets i wanted my work to revolve much more around uncovering patterns in largediverse data sets and simplifying complex insights for the rest of the business to work off of ive been looking into everything from entry level data scientist to sr data analyst to economic consultant to management consultant to strategic finance positions my masters gave me a solid overview of near everything would anyone be willing to take a look at my resume and figure what avenue may be most fruitful in this tough job market,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2UEdCWkE3NVYtN19ZbzBBMW12NU4tN09PSEtldTV5TTNRUlBOR01BWnlHUHpsUHlRQ192ZUNiTmtFLVBqNDZqVkJpRm50b1BqNzhoZG5vWVh4eTVzRmF2dnZMQWUyRDJKWnFDR3VFaTRpRkE9

thank you now i dont need to write this out im the responsible senior mlai architect at our company ive been pushing for ml solutions for a year when the ceo decided we need to train people on this shit so they sat down with the local uni to come up with a training plan we ended up with x hours of explaining how chatgpt works how to do agents and how to do rag meanwhile our data quality is ass and whener i try to explain that to anyone they explain back how thats complicated to fix well duh but isnt this why you hired me at least we have a product that has deep learning and a poc for a classification model that actually makes sense,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dVo1bFplZWZTZV9xVzBFQm5BVGhETzFTbFdERk5mSHp0NXhiY1FMODh3NXlsSHVWZy1TeGI0UmpJX3NfZ1dVa2QyMW1rbkZuNXFSeVlKRXQ2RGpOdlE9PQ==

this comment from rconsulting nails the situation > its not bs if you understand what the role is some manager needs to make some changes so they can prove to their supervisors that they should keep getting promoted that manager can come up with their own plan and if it fails theyll be blamed and limit their upward mobility alternatively that manager could hire a consultant and if the plan fails then clearly the consultant sucks so it shouldnt limit their career trajectory > if you think the game is telling business leaders things they dont know about their business yeah its bs and you probably will feel unfulfilled if you think the game is finding people in strategically ambiguous situations and making them look smart so they keep hiring you you can be successful and actually win that game managers arent conned its strategic accountability engineering,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2UVJ4ZHZyeTJ0Zk53Z1lhbmJRbWFLUGhMaXIyTUcyRU9YemZybkRIRWhXUEdmdXhVLUpSMDZTS2xoaGlfUGFmeFNFY1VIN2w2SkRLeFNudU1FUVNEOHc9PQ==
its a good approach and how ive seen it done in the past ceiling of the method is ultimately based on accuracy of the individual forecasts which are going to fluctuate on intermittent cloudy days like you have seen only suggestion i have is using interpretable ml models try ebm from the interpretml python package to better understand the ensembling on timestamps you are having issues for those forecasts see which models its weighting the highest in the prediction then check to see how each individual model forecast compares to the actual for that prediction if its weighing the most accurate model the highest but the ensembling is still off its prolly related to base nwp model error if it looks like it should be weighting other models higher see if you can feature engineer your way into it weighting the models correctly in the situations you are having issues another suggestion would be to use some form of quantile regression you can do it with lightgbm forecast p<number> p<number> p<number> youll then have uncertainty intervals for your individual point predictions you can check to see if forecasts are biased towards either tail during the periods you are having issues youll also likely that the diff between p<number> and p<number> forecasts are wider during the intermittent cloudy periods,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2emd3c2QzTXllc0l5TkxIaFlnZGw3akxaVjREclRPbkxfVEtBUVN5ZFB3Qy1jSzExTHlWS2lZYmJpWHptQW1nZ3hmRG1lOXhDSC1jLVJjRjRxWU5fSmo2NWJpaXV3YS1nSTYzTmt0YmtUYmc9

i experience this sometimes in my work in one particular problem i ended up with a blend of the two i hand selected features based on domain knowledge and tried to reduce collinearity eg if <number> variables were highly correlated id select the one that was more business relevant intuitive or rename it to capture the essence of both if possible from there i built an elastic net model and tunedvalidated using rolling time series out of sample predictions but kept the regularization as low as possible to minimize bias on my coefficients for the output i presented the impact of variables by multiplying their relevant zscore say last week by their coefficient this is essentially what youd do if predicting last weeks metrics but i reported them individually rather than summing to provide the dependent variable i believe this is done in mixed marketing models though i dont have experience with them its not a causal model and still prone to omitted variable bias but itll give more intuition to stakeholders as to whats happening behind the model,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2d1l1b3dvbUxURnE4WlVYNlhhdTJodDY4MFhOMlg3MlptdFFRVlBjNkE0VENEdENid2NCUHJHdkE4RjZyUHp3Q2V6N1hZWFowQkJXVjl3Mi15QUp1QnIzTDZoVFhtLThLUXk5YXU5TXNRdjQ9

as someone who works in this space and the top space id get a different project if this is your job why are you asking reddit this is very mature space and very regulated so there isnt really scope for interesting work that is going to impress anyone here but the short answer is almost all credit scoring models are logistic regression the exceptions are at mega banks with gobs of data i am talking s of millions customers then xg boost is sometimes used deep learning is never used because when you deny credit you have to give reason for why you denying and be usre that its not denying credit on the basis of racegenderage etc you might say your not doing credit scoring but credit risk but credit scoring is credit risk credit risk models are probability of default nopayment models,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dWxPQlF1OGdkNEFXeG5uZFJ3VUZyWkxMZzNDTTRxUVZyTHU1UmRoOUZXZ0I4akFRd040eVpzTUZkNVh1VU9xanJZWFE5Ui1lQXhjNnNsZmZJX1gxUlE9PQ==
this is a common situation in the industry a lot of people follow the tshape approach in this career go wide before going deep imo the tshape approach is great imo you can try mle roles in other companies particularly in ml platforminfra teams however you may struggle initially in those teams because they value software engineering backgrounds more than fullstack ds at least in my experience but after a while you should be okay to get into those roles you may have to pass swe interview rounds leetcode and practice system design if youre interested you can start the prep and interview in a couple of months,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2cTBWakw0cGFXZFR1NTRoV24zdUdfb3g3UktRSVVVTlowS19QSGFQd05OalVORW1LcUJja3B2dUNoN1hTcHlKQWNjVm12dDdncWxyY205djNZc1JnOWc9PQ==
thanks for this nuanced response i would empathize with much of your approach a little fuzzy on the zscore by coefficient mult but if youre showing the impact of the variation i hear you to me this feels generally still feels more in alices turf because of the holdout scores being key to the final model i suppose one way of framing this is whether one justifies a model a la alice a nonparametric model justified by a holdout or bob a parametric model justified by doing the best to satisfy all the parametric assumptions perhaps in that sense and in your example i think alice can still wield many of bobs techniques but that final question can still lead to different models and explanations possibly,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2eHkwYUM2ZUgtWm5PYks1aVRPWFlDc2c2SVhKRVVHYWUxWnNJQkFJc25ZYnpyd0lsOFRSYzU2bXNlVWcxNzRSS0F4eDY4SU5UcGhOTnFob25lREZja0E9PQ==

as someone who doesnt work in a tech firm but builds quantitative models understands how ai works and also an older millennial who remembers just how long it took for computers and the internet to fully integrate into society you guys are expecting too much too fast and the entire tech industry is this kind of technology takes decades to fully integrate gen ai has some very obvious productivity benefits and most americans hadnt even used chat gpt at the end of <number> source pew i can tell you in my industry which makes up a massive <number> percent of gdp gen ai isnt even allowed for firmwide usage yet data privacy and other concerns have to be worked through my firm is the industry leader for the space so until its widely used here i doubt anyone else is following suit so how can you measure pay offs when most industries arent even really using these things wide spread why would their be pay offs to foundational ai when it isnt even significantly monetized yet tech firms in general have benefited a lot from easy finance from <number> to <number> and as a result the whole industry has adapted to basically hyping up every little project they do in order to attract investor dollars if you want to understand how the world works you basically should leave the bubble and start talking and reading what other people think ai isnt going to do everything the tech industry claims it does however have very real productivity benefits in forms of speeding up bureaucratic documentation work and hopefully becoming search on steroids that will turn into tangible pay offs but that isnt going to happen until its usage is widespread that goes even more to current startup projects related to ai how can you really expect to make returns if your customers are only vagule awre of it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2cS1ZWkdhODhIRGZINGd0M1FNOUFRbmg5ajdkaFBWN200cDROOWtIYnVNNDNCOC1fbkxhcXV3aFdtN0w2MF83VEdscW1rdVJucHNqaGdsQV9qdG04b1E9PQ==

you cant completely ignore predictive performance even when the target is inference mostly because if you have bad predictive performance then your model is likely misspecified however an inferential approach would not optimize for predictive performance since there are variables when added as covariates might distort the coefficient of interest eg colliders in a predictive context however it doesnt matter as long as it adds information you also cant completely ignore explainability if looking from a prediction only perspective either you might not care about the magnitude of effect but youre interested in seeing what the model thinks are good especially when youre considering complex black box models like nn there are a lot of cautionary tales out there of people not looking at what the model is using to predict carefully esp in the presence of systematic bias such as those early radiology cnn papers where the model uses the background contrast in your example i would be worried for bob if bobs auc is <number> and alices auc is <number> and vice versa i will be worried for alice if the auc is <number> but the model decides the top feature is some useless metadata as a bob i will also defend bob in the sense that bob is not pulling a causal graph out of nowhere and bob will likely perform a lot of sensitivity analyses to ensure that this assumptions are at least not severely impacting his results,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RDVkSTZzVHMyS3JOWFVlMkVfeHdNQWVRd284ZUQyTUpPN1JKYVFTcWlWRVNHTHBfUG1IOTJsbnpIYVVQUnhyUTgyeU5odVV5cVN4TmowcU1BM2JZT2c9PQ==

hey i appreciate this thoughtout reply i agree with you writ large but troubling on some specifics >i will be worried for alice if the auc is <number> but the model decides the top feature is some useless metadata i guess i would feel that a wellspecified problem needed for both alice and bob and a holdout covers this fairly well i also think implicit in both alice and bobs approach is making sure theres no features that are information leaks which is a bit easier to say for forecasting event outcomes than otherwise though >however an inferential approach would notoptimizefor predictive performance since there are variables when added as covariates might distort the coefficient of interest eg colliders you know i think pointing to the coefficient of interest is important and further specifies my confusion very often when im approached with a problem that coefficient of interest doesnt really exist its usually just a wideopen door so thinking of colliders if there was a red car kind of problem a la in insurance that would still be interesting and would just lead to further modeling to suss out whats going on there in which case i think putting on bobs hat is critical noteably though i guess that has me starting off as alice even if ending up as bob >as a bob i will also defend bob in the sense that bob is not pulling a causal graph out of nowhere and bob will likely perform a lot of sensitivity analyses to ensure that this assumptions are at least not severely impacting his results i hear you my hesitation here is perhaps simply that bobs work is i think honestly a bit more complicated than alices and its easier to make a slip here because real world problems are so complicated and getting to do experiments is rare so having optimized for performance first makes me feel like i have a much quicker attachment to empirical outcomes from which it can be whittled to more specific business needs sorry im meandering a bit youre response got the gears turnin,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3STF0RFl1SFo3YnFkRHZXYUlFUmtyWllGdFVmcFRHRmVWZWZtSjI0Sm5naW9DelpxZWU4Y0VjQWhQQ0x0bE01eWNLZU12Q2JLSlhVR3hDd0NHRXpyekE9PQ==

was watching a marketing staff member generate voiceovers for a commercial problem the more they regenerated the same lines with the same voice setting the more it was obvious the output was not consistent while generating can scale infinitely one cannot use humans to discriminate infinitely at scale specific problem was that the commercial would be run in a geographic region with a heavy accent and documented and admitted xenophobia they had to get an accent close to the regional accent and include colloquialisms and etc they also ran into timing and cadence issues if casting a human vo actor they couldve easily just said speed that part up its gotta fit this <number> second limit the bot required them rewriting copy something they were also using genai for and of course using genai for copy the problem persists because it has no concept of cadence and timing in speech as n input it just is what it hallucinates the output to be based on the seed tokens,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UnRXemhOLTM5d3RrUEk2VlBXZnpPU1dPUU85cFJuOE1XSG91Q3RQSWF4cXhuOGpUSTZhOWZuQlRLSjl2UUdlemlFaElDNVhPRWdOZEdGbVRtelBVOWc9PQ==

great response i think i can add two points here <number> on alices well specified problem i totally agree if alice did her due diligence and look at shapvimp values and ensure that there is no systematic issues with the data then there are no concerns with alice similarly a good bob will also have to do the due diligence and assess model predictive performance <number> on the coefficient of interest i think you just havent worked in fields where this is the case i work in health research i am a biostatistician and it is very common to have one specific effect of interest eg treatment response and the other variables are used to ensure that there are no confounding variables distorting that one covariate of interest i do agree if the question is totally open then bobs approach is not the best ie causal graph to estimate what exactly,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3WXdLWXlKXzFRM1NHanRSZDNWN2NzZ00ySFU4M25VYjRyd2ZmTnVvc29OMUt4aUFLUDFENjlOS21jT0xFWHRqSFZLTG9RTWl5dmJKa1ZYUnJmazRQTHc9PQ==

ive used wandb and mlflow wandb has some really nice features like data versioningregistration and lineage tracking that mlflow doesnt have you can do a hacky version of this in mlflow by registering datasets as a custom python model though wandb is also hosted for you which can be a major plus for some teams and companies on the other hand mlflow does model serving and has model recipes most of what wandb does mlflow can do for free minus computecloud costs if i had to choose between the two id go with wandb but if you need to have full control end to end mlflow is good,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aFhZaWxnTm5zbzlvWFlDNlVyQ2FfSlZBTFM3dXU5cVJEZVpGYzhhb0ozNHN4M0p3U2ZMRl9RQnRueVItR3A4MmpYRUxIdFEwZ0ZZOUdpakRqRHhvUlNqTUF3ekhRejJibFRSZFFFamZaOGM9

it depends on the data science team but let me give you an example lets say the team is working on a particularly complex problem that would benefit from fourier analysis on some times series data maybe a library or some code for their particular purposes does not exist yet a mathematician may then be useful to translate stuff like this <url><url> into usable code it is also useful to have a mathematician around just to make sure you are not violating some mathematical assumption maxim or rule in the same vein that a statistician knows the assumptions of statistics and would stop you from violating those that said not every data science job needs this level of mathematics like most things in life it depends,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3V1BoRlVfNE5WejV0b1d5Z1paQTNWOHJxQ3F6YlNqNlJrNUd3RG9sblNnQ2R4Z3haZkNwZngtVFRFcmV3NTJXRTBOY3l5Q1ItWGlYUm5rRDNvOXZvM2c9PQ==

i dont think its that cut and dry there are some important activities where genai already has a big impact writing code is definitely one its not hype developers can write higher quality code faster and with higher job satisfaction with an ai assistant when broken down well many tasks can be improved with genai that last part is key if you throw genai onto the end of a process or just try and throw the whole process into context and get a completion youll get trash out even google search has fallen victim to this magic thinking and they invented transformers and modern search new technology has ups and downs i believe its inevitable that software systems have agentic ai workflows as their features but theres going to be a big learning curve and some continued advancements first,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MkU2ZEh2cHl4X1lVMDdCMHVMUXZXZ2JRRjNBMkhTOE1PV2NGMzQ2TGRkaVFqRlRXQ0JCeV9WY3ZqRkNWUHdmX0I1VTJ2VE01MGpONEw5eVNCbUl4a1E9PQ==

i agree thats the type of use case itll be good for i think the issue is there just isnt that much profit in that sort of thing compared to the amount of money being sunk into gen ai speculation like this stuff is being priced as if its a genuine paradigm shift like facebook or uber it would have to fully cut out parts of the value chain or massively reorganise consumer behaviour to achieve that keeping everything largely the same but developers are now x more productive because they have a nicer virtual assistant doesnt do that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3N2tJQzhUS1lvVVZuSEdHdmpHZnh5aVRwV3NoZmNFV3RRel9sT3ktcXhqQ21NYXNLOFFQaVEzczNhdFY1LXU4enl6ckFqUWNfVDVmcDcxZWNRY2JCMkE9PQ==

hi i would argue that these are very different roles and you are missing some jobs let me try to identify the roles their limitations and skills i am sure many in the field will disagree since it seems to have not yet settled and is somewhat subjective a data consultant is someone whos main job is to provide advice to mostly external customers on how to store and process data my experience is that many consultants have a fixed set solutions they try to convince the customer with they often organize or do the migrations from one solutions to another sometimes these are very spezialized solutions for certain domains or industry sectors bad consultants are just little more than sales reps with a some technical background a data engineer is actually a software engineer with the skills to develop solutions that can handle large amounts of organized und unorganized data data lakes and etl pipelines is not only something they should be able to use but something they should be able to develop test and run data engineers are also able to implement solutions to acquire or collect data there a lot of admins moving into this field after as it can look like they dont need to code as much the ability to code solutions makes the difference between a good or an excellent data engineer though i recommend a software engineer who was an admin at some point a data scientist closely works with a data engineer but they are not necessarily software engineers although that makes them much better at their jobs they are people who are able to analyse and interpret the data they create the right interpretation of statistics in the contexts of the business they are also aware of the datas limitation and caveats biases are their arch nemesis and some would consider themselves as data wranglers or controllers depending on their industry often they are people who are good at creating reports and visualizations for management to make decisions this person is also the data owner but needs to understand their job security depends on the added value they provide not on their technical irreplaceability or on their ability to make nice diagrams they need to be flexible and communicative mathematicians with a business understanding rare breed edit here i cannot stress enough that data scientists can be the most valuable asset to a company excellent ones are like unicorns to be honest i have come across <number> people like that they were both severly underpaid underrated and talked down to by the ceo am anecdote one guy saved the ceo millions by providing data that was contradicting the ceos opinion about the market ceo was not amused kicked out the guy but followed what he had found in the data excellent data scientists can save companies an aiml scientist is a person who is able to train and develop completely new models for specific tasks a ml scientist understands the use case and selects or creates a model to be trained they understand the difference between train dev or validation and test set they work closely with the data team to get the right data together they need to come up with the data in the right quality they will tell you the hyperparameters to run for inference they will tell you what model to use not the other way around management should stfu when it comes to the selection of the model even if it is trendy to use an llm for everything right now they will also tell you if an llm is overkill and you should be using something smaller they know why and how to use gpus and when and why not they will also tell you if ml is even the right solution for the problem this person needs to be the most honest of them all blunt even and a bit of a mad hatter really most have a phd as a lot of theory goes into these models getting the data right for the task is <number> of the work data scientist and ml scientist need to work closely together if they are not the same person in the project an ai engineer is again a software engineer but with the skill to pick up a model from the ai scientist or an open source one and use it to implement a product to solve the intended problem with it depending on the environment the people working as ai engineers benefit from knowledge about cloud architecture and cloud administration this requires quite a few years of software experience in my opinion to get any good at this they are wizards and wisetrained beyond their years you see they all have slighlty different purposes and jobs in reality people wear multiple hats the best people in the field are those who can do or understand everything in the process but have indepth understanding of one part these are some of the roles that are being mentioned in mlops in contrast to devops so which job to pick for a bright future first of all all of them are very expensive employees small and medium businesses probably wont hire data andai teams after the current hypes however the demand for data scientist and ai engineers will slighlty increase as more and more tools needhave ai in one way or the other model training as part of ai research is something most companies cannot afford they will tell their ai engineers to use one of the open source models instead and then get upset that it does not work for their use cases and consultants well consultancy is always a thing but it will not be paid as well as the other jobs maybe their work will be taken over by an llm agent at some point,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Sk85Z3cwNm0wczJXbm9DanFSTWkwcS1BVzBjc1ViTHdvTEtVdXFYTmV2WHprS2dhU3VMcjROLTcwSUxhMVNMSUN3SDNxeVFMeXFkUW9ZZ2V1T3lrSFE9PQ==

i think the answer here entirely depends on what the data is what is it you are trying to model by performing these regressions if you have one numerical output and multiple inputs and multiple categories but you are only concerned about one of the inputs a linear regression of that one input to the one output could be fine and you could use the other data to demonstrate that you have a sufficiently broad set of those other values to show that they do not interfere with that one regression similarly you could have a higher order regression with one input and and one output or nonlinear functions but which function you chose should be base on an understanding of the two variables and their relationship to one another looking at only one input and one output could be especially valuable if there is only one input you can control say in an engineering context such as a pump speed and you can monitor all the other variables you may alternatively use one input and one output and then use the other variables to see whether you should have multiple analyses for different sets of conditions say by performing a principle component analysis pca if you have a dataset where there are multiple inputs and you want to model how they affect an output or multiple outputs there is a broad number of ways to examine this multi variate analysis a multiple linear regression could be fine but it is important to understand the assumptions for such models independence etc if variables are not independent you could use pls but again understanding why you are using one method or another is very important the simplest way conceptually though not in practice would be to slap every method in your dataset and see what sticks and gives you apparently useful information i say apparently useful information as the real risk of just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks is that you may build correlations that are arbitrary or spurious due to coincidences or collinearity in the data,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3QlA1WjFWekMtWnVReFNnZHNraTNyRUR1WnlaX1AzSVNJQWh4MThpLUsyV2JsZ1BGWmxFN2pNM1NSRjRqZmNzMlhmT2tDSXU0UFVrWnpQM2Q1OGZmdFE9PQ==

tableau dashboards and those of similar tools are one of the few ways in which you can really showcase a model and its behavior and results to business stakeholders they are also kind of a cheatcode when working in projects as for nontechnical users a locally run model that outputs to a dashboard still counts as a deliverable in my experience those dashboards can get you a promotion but not necessarily the equivalent respect of your peers that said if you want to do mainly tableau it makes more sense to be the producttranslateranalyst person in a data science team that role can be a lot of fun but is kind of difficult to find and the career progression would likely be managerial and not technical,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3THVlaHZTWi1IWEI4N0M1alF0MjJsOGdrdDZmRmkxV3BZNmNkZEIwVk5pMDhQc3lJSG8zSXQ0aGNzaFVadmRfMjJsRnZnMEM5eTFkUWpOVVV5WDFLbHhqTnVMZGFFMlZiVkxGUUVhdFBodzg9

are you asking about data scientist as a role or data scientist as a job title i would choose larger companies banks hospitals insurance if you want tableau and data science a smaller company might rely on you using something less expensive something r or python based larger companies can have several dashboard platforms in their environment i dont see anything wrong with using a dashboarding tool to get users to validate data and assumptions plus having data out there in an investigable format allows your users to ponder and then come to you with more complex projects thats how it works for me,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TERIaEdnU3VPMzluX3JzN21ZTUYxVlRfN0VOSDU0cVdxZTc5dFdkSDBVSkpJN1ZSSmpHN0hSS2U3dDdZQ2Q0WkxYNnF0VGRWd3JSd0FoNVdlLW5CMXc9PQ==
i dont think i presented it as cut and dry i acknowledged that some companies will have valuable use cases for using genai also id put using stuff like copilot in a different category to developing your own genai products or incorporating genai into your product the former is using a product someone else has developed and if you get productivity gains from that fine i dont think this is what the article was about and its not what im talking about,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SzVDVUgxSXhRbjdfcGY3dmVRVjZhTFJUa2MyYl81OV9VY2R5bjNMRW9ud3VLWUc4THRLWmdJd25jV3R1c1pKZGhLZERaMHFjbGNONDE3Vi1odUt4RVE9PQ==

hey if i understand your post correctly you are looking at this from a freelancer perspective if so you are probably serving small teams within big companies or smaller companies that want to do their aidata transition if my assumption above is correct i would say that data and ai are like peanut butter and jellythey go hand in hand so if you can position yourself as a data consultant who also rocks at ai calling yourself a data and ai consultant totally makes sense it shows these teams youve got the skills to handle both itll help you stand out but id also say chances are <number> of the job would likely be on the data engineering side hope that helps,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3dXFkUTkyYVFxSUlkM2VTTHdXMnh3ZERudm5iNmRZVUZUVTg4RWEwVFdZa3V5ajFwS044Y21XcnBwOHdaLUlOZWxhTHVsNjhQRUVVdkdXQ0Z5TFVPQlE9PQ==

it depends on what youre trying to do if its purely a prediction problem then tree based methods like random forest or xg boost typically outperform most linear models they are also easy to implement i typically only use linear polynomial regressions in instances where explaining how the model works is important if that is the case just know that as your model gets more complex like going from a linear regression to a polynomial regression it gets more challenging to explain to stakeholders how certain variables affect the predictor one way you can identify if a polynomial regression would fit the data better is by looking for this pattern in the error terms of a linear regression intro to statistical learning has a good explainer about how to do this,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SVA5YnBwV0xjN2tFbFAtWTdueG50UDdEWXhNQm9MRjRGWWxxek9jY2ZsX3lLeWFCYjlncmJsX0RKVjZWVk9CWngxNWhHRlRwVDNFejlPMGtnYnNERUdyOUo0VXRqU3kyUlNadkhjaTRqWnc9

anyone with any ounce of experience knows that the best mushrooms grow in bullshit including mushrooms that help with hallucinations trying to decipher the title and a few comments because ive seen this report on a couple of different platforms now my highly scientific assessment is that people are tired of nonsense or simplifications or mistakes being called bullshit or hallucination when bullshit is actually something that comes out of the anus of a bull and hallucination is what you get when you consume hallucinogens like hallucinogenic mushrooms but if you put this all together you dont get hallucinations without bullshit or cowshit that can grow the mushrooms actually in business i heard a few times people described as mushrooms that is people who are kept in the dark and fed shit where shit in this sense of the word is informational nonsense and being kept in the dark is to be lied to or to be excluded from aspects of a business i havent read this paper i skimmed a couple of paragraphs at the beginning but i am curious about whether or not it mentions mushrooms or the type of grass that bulls need to eat to produce the best bullshit for the best hallucinogenic mushrooms actually i might finish by mentioning that its difficult to get store bought mushrooms that havent been grown on animal wastes so you can get mushrooms from bullshit cowshit and other sorts of shit but you can also get mushrooms called wood mushrooms these are mushrooms that grow from timber fallen trees or selected harvested wood that is seeded i think the classic wood mushroom in popular culture is called the shitake mushroom it is not hallucinogenic i think it tends to be expensive where i am au<cur><number>au<cur><number> a kilogram <url> <url>,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YUg1U3ZBRk1iZTZ4WE9DYUh4V2VIUlB3RVBQZnR2V09zLWplcXRBcG9kbExEcE0zRjNQRHBZd2hqeW9ETkJhWUxsUzRkMnp2S1pvaXVGNVBEWnJFdWc9PQ==

hey it sounds like youre feeling very normal human feelings unfortunately because people also have natural tendencies to feel anxious about social status they avoid being vulnerable about things like this now i dont mean to minimize in case you do have something like depression but you might be just having a very healthy reaction that puts some emotional safe distance between you and what could potentially be toxic culture traits seeping in was this preceded by lots of work we can also have burnout that can magnify a lot of this reaching out and articulating these feelings is a great first step connections can help if you get some criticism or static in the comments hey anyone with the guts to be vulnerable on a platform like this has encountered that its tough to ignore but know that most likely those are hurt folks hurting others focus on the reassuring feedback its ok to sometimes not feel ok best of luck,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TXM2bWdURVhTeUhkZS1KaVFydzVIbG5EMWRIMVJ5Mko4eVlheUQxMDNOazc2WVF1ZFMwbEo5VGFfV3Nrb0o4N2ViLUFnbzFIWFE1UjNsUlV4aGJDMGc9PQ==

yes this is a common problem that companies face this gets worse as the company gets bigger instead of departments you have entire country sites with different definitions the scenario described is a classic symptom of poor data governance practices particularly the lack of centralized business metadata lookml is a data modeling language and not specifically designed for metrics management while it can help with data standardization it might not be the best fit for centralizing and governing metrics definitions you have a few options depending on the company size and capabilities informal solution for the time being you can have a dedicated team or person responsible for maintaining a centralized metrics dictionary or catalog this can be a physical document a wiki page or even a dedicated platform like a metrics store formal solutions metrics catalog platforms like metriql metricsstore or datacatalog which provide a centralized repository for metrics definitions and calculation methodologies data governance platforms like alation collibra or informatica which offer features for metrics management and data cataloging typically its a data governance teams job to work with business to get a consistent set of definitions that can be a challenge given that each department has its own perspectives on definitions or have metrics that are native to their department i could talk at length about this topic but i just wanted to share the relevant points of interest,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Q01pQUJQV19YX0E5N25Rd3BISUd4OTNtR3h1eGYzMnRQZzNFZGlQOFNqMnBRMWc5bHAzdzVWM2VGdlhIa0lFcmY0NVdQajNxMlNUcXctWndBQ1FLNmJtcWxpN053T05XOGNXb3VvWlZKR3M9

for sure change it the purpose and intent of hr titles is very different than the purpose for your resume prioritize a title and clear description that will accurately communicate what you do did and are capable of a resume is a communication tool i say the same for linkedin its no ego or vanity or lying its clear communication and you deserve for people to understand what you do titles are widely different across companies with that you can apply this same philosophy when looking for a job dont judge a role by its title in addition to changing the title for communication i think with reason you can change to appeal to the company you apply for too dont change it to overplay what you can do but if you notice the company likes engineer or analysts as part of there company language and culture update it so that you relate from a hiring manager,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Yjd4c2hNaHNuSDdKV0Q2cXdBenZSOENrSUtqZlJSY1kyd0xQeEJ3Q09QX1NXaGhMam83YmEwY3dRMXRSYV93V29NTVl1SDYzVWFSam44ZkF1d0otQUE9PQ==

they are light on the math these are supplementary books graduate level economics students will take several courses on econometrics which basically cover the mathematics of linear regression in depth causal inference as these books cover them are essentially research designs that set up contexts for where linear regression can be use to estimate the causal effect on x on y in a business context companies can actually generate these setups through experiments ie pricing in different markets if you have a solid foundation in linear regression i think your good for these books if you dont the simplest book on the subject would probably be wooldriges introductory econometrics which is an undergrad text that does not use linear algebra if you want something thats more rigorous fumio hayashis econometrics is an elegant treatment on regression as a subset of gmm estimator davison and mackinnon is a mathematics oriented treatment of regression as a linear projection its elegant hayashi does have sample code none of these books are code heavy economists arent trained in python and python has only become popular recently regression is pretty mature so its easy enough to find libraries in languages,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Z0tEV3RmYzd4S0NoRlJlT0MycU12X3ExeDlNa3lLdmVtZXh0WmNDMnNYNlJoWndfM1dPZjgtWVRHRVRTa2NINlRHRHQzdDFJdGZBb3JwSWJuR0xYSWc9PQ==
> most stats packages will have a way to automatically test it but its always good to test if each marketing strategy component is statistically significant vs the dependent variable this isnt necessarily relevant especially when the predictors are correlated the univariate effects suffer from omitted variable bias > if the t or f test comes back that the statistical significance of the marketing strategy is high then you can reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that the marketing strategy has a level of significance or level of causation against the dependent variable which would be sales a standard tftest doesnt indicate causation any more than a measure of correlation > im sure im missing a whole bunch of other tests to check for heteroskedasticity biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median autocorrelation data correlates with itself over time and other issues that arise from running panel data assumptions should not be explicitly tested for a wide variety of reasons most of which are outlined in the context of normality testing here<url> > heteroskedasticity biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median heteroskedasticity isnt bias and it doesnt really have anything do to with the separation of the mean from the median which is sometimes used as a measure of skew,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3R2ROb1pmMHcwVnB2SGxNSk0tM1VJOHVydmNPWEVlOWJXRkpzanB1UXFFbXg5RnJXYUlleEpKeHJXLWtuZVZrWkxTNlVfQ29CYXBwSi0tb2JscHRkdnc9PQ==

if you are early in your career and substantial life circumstances arent pushing you to earn more then take the long view on your career heres some tips from someone with <number> years of experience <number> it is enormously emotionally draining to have a very clear passion and to be doing work outside of that passion <number> over the arc of your career your focus on the soft and hard skills that will significantly increase the scale of your impact and correspond with promotions short term deviations into things that dont grow your skills even if they come with a pay bump arent generally beneficial in the long run you need a significant amount of motivation and hard work to climb the title and pay ladder and it is much easier if you are excited about the work the one exception is if the role would open up doors that roles that match your interest cannot for example i took a role that doesnt align with my long term passion but was with a top <number> tech company after i was on the radar of all the recruiters of top companies and have only been working in elite companies since then <number> aim to start building a network of data scientist youve meet at conferences meet ups or prior jobs that can help you make these types of decisions,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3T1VwMWdwVHk1U0JQdmI0dUt0Y0J0UnN4bUhzZHV6MEU5QzVFX3JRSGtJNGdQYnNtQWhTUGw3WjVIQm5oTER4VmNTN2QwVzlEdV9jRkgzNjNIbktXVUE9PQ==

nice to know im not alone it feels very strange having worked as a ds for so long and only now getting imposter syndrome in my case the team im on seem to have no visible problems with their work however i imagine this is due to them being here longer than me and not noticing the mess being created around them and partly due to my own bias as of course they cant know everything and probably do have problems im at the point where i feel they hired the wrong guy and im struggling to see how i can contribute given how unusual and messy the infrastructure and data is ill take your advice though and check for quality issues maybe getting some low hanging fruit issues solved will boost my confidence thanks,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4dWFGcUhQQndLZWsxQWFvd2JleTdNcVJ0MVJZd1EtVXc0OXI3NDJvYjNUVzlfaUdvbFhINjYwalJJRkl0WElaenlqbVpBMERkY2dBMHJIblpnQXZlaUE9PQ==

most places have terrible documentation and processes so not understanding the data for months or years is completely normal you may completely understand one data system then be asked to complete another project in a different data system and you have to start all over again this is normal this is the science part the same can happen with domain knowledge if you spend years mastering pricing models then switch to logistics youre basically starting over or if you switch from banking to retail a lot of people like this because they get bored easily dont worry about not knowing you figured it out before so you can do it again,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4OExldG1pcVNkX29IZ2dTN3dEdWlaVl84SG55MDZ6RmZubmkydW1RVDlFQk1RZmZQcm9qS2VNTkVUdVlyYW9MSE9zOEY2dGVTMlhETExobU55NVpvMlpMcWQ3RFV5aVh5ZDRoZ3JHYndXeXM9

this can happen when reporting isnt maintained and you get some filters that are no longer necessary or they change and no one updates the code the other thing could be a lack of knowledge of one of the parties maybe one does a distinct step just in case of dupes where the other was told there would only be one record for each order then things like this can change as systems change finally different departments can have different rationale for calculating things differently or having different data sets for instance customer surveys data i maintained had test surveys to test pilots or certain things these data were excluded from say score cards for frontline employees but might be used in those test case or other broad verbatim analysis for your example total orders does it include future orders that havent happened yet one group might want to recognize theyve sold <number> orders when looking at sales however if youre in another group you may not want to recognize the order till you actually receive the money i would say try to define it in common terms where you can it should be pointed out there may be some reason they are slightly different or it could be a find that someone messed up or forgot about something finally the best way is to define in footnoteintro that way people can go oh how is he calculating as sometimes some things need to be standard throughout the company and some things dont,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4dGRnZ0lTQlFQVC1nMVdSN0RmM2FLZ1k1UWJwSERQOURNQjFubFc4eGlEcDlLbk9sWmh6bnNMY1FsRU5HWW90UC1oOTM5S2tsVld4U2xZVHVJMzcxYUE9PQ==

some companies have a policy that referrals have to be looked over and the recruiter has to contact the person and its mandatory other companies dont have this policy so you can have a referral and nothing happens or the recruiter looks at the resume and ignores it some companies get so many referrals that its impossible to look over every referrals for campus recruiting eg new grad early career internship google got so many referrals that now they dont follow back on referrals and they dont give the referrer updates also unless someone had an internship at google campus referrals are basically i know this person because they are my friend or they went to my uni or i know they parent so my opinion is that this are unfair also referrers can write something about you on a referral most of the time are people writing something about you do they personally know you or have some connection in small companies it might not matter but in larger companies it could matter particularly if they get too many referrals about your questions we dont even know if the hiring managers are looking at your resume or not,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4cHFOMUgycl9uazctS3o2YXJSN1VXWXN3Rmd5dm9GalhIZTk1Z19rd1MyWHBqWTIteHRqX1VRUFFmeFNIdjF1d3N0ZXJoRklJX3NoZGw3ZzdDcUUzQ1VIZHRrSDFNa24zbU1HWU85VXJRZVE9

>also consider stability a big pay bump for a role or company thar might disappear in <number><number> months is probably not worth it this is the big one for me i had some time at a couple jobs where the pay was great but if the company had one bad year theyd go under or a bigger company that does layoffs i hate starting over as a new guy and it takes a solid year at a company often to really get settled learn their systems and data and who to talk with for x and y now id much prefer a company where i can stay for an extended period and feel secure i wont be looking for another job next year pay is a bit worse but ive got a pension and more pto and have lots of coworkers that have all been there for a decade or two so im not worried about going anywhere ive done the startup thing and its not fun work so much setting up infrastructure and some dashboards but not fun mathy stuff or ml they didnt have time for it pay was good but it was constant fires of things not working and just trying to keep the ship afloat and from all my friends that also went that route most dont last past a couple years if youre young and looking for money though its a good option,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4LXMzeWR6Qkw3TWp1MHZoTUVlV183X0hYc1E5eWJQVnM0cjB0OEMzVkVqRHBhbFI2b3YwcUVMRndVaUJQRkFEV0o4VGhaSEZrVVhlcTA4UVJTcXE1b2t4R3R6UjZKVThBeW1xYXQzazQ4Zlk9

im sure it varies by company and org but in my experience referrals for random candidates who havent actually directly worked with the referring employee are not valued any more than applying without a referral we are asked to explain our prior working relationship as part of the referral process and directly speak to their abilities maybe seek some resume feedback on rresumes,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MEJ5SWJ3NHZKNVNnWnRuYXVwdnNRems0aDVVOVhWX1VKWTRxbmVSR3FMNUlCZy1FdVV5aUpuUG0xRE9TTEs1TExMVVNtWkFuWFlsQVFwbGQ0cU5zR0E9PQ==

well i think thats your answer consider reaching out to people who were ahead of you in school and have been in jobs for longer or attend the same meetupsnetworking events over and over again so that you can build deeper relationships with people its a tough market so a referral from someone who cannot vouch for you or from someone far removed from the actual position is not super likely to get you in front of the hiring manager,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SW92ZGtRVmUydUtndElqV2REZDg5WnRtaGlRUmdHLTVyMzFEUWVzTGdadEo2aEdHSVFfNDhwSWhFOWZhbVNOUllWVzdkT0x6cWltbTNTdTMyRUhJZ3c9PQ==

theres an existing comment that has a great list of technical points i dont have anything to add to it beyond those i look mostly for strong experimental mindset interestcreativity in thinking through potential explanations confounders and how one might deal with them practically talk through hypothetical or real problems and see how they think about them for anything causal related i get worried if people seem to be applying a recipe i like it when people try to think through the mechanisms theyre explaining take time to understand the process theyre modeling and then apply some sort of method a perfect experiment barely needs statistics to analyze big chunk of causal inference is the study of why your experimentquasiexperiment isnt perfect and how to deal with the imperfections,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4NlNOU3A2OEcteUFBWXhPTTJfWnVfTjB0aURKbUh2aVc2R0JQczBXNHlsajVNZWN0MHhqRXlhaUt3bkt3ODBvZzktNzUwcDVMR0VhNmhBbUcyd2Etbnc9PQ==

fwiw op as an academic i would not consider most of the above meaningful background in causal inference i was expecting knowledge of g estimation and maybe attractor reconstruction and the like whats above is basic stats knowledge for someone whos trying to pass their qualifying exams its good to know that this is how industry defines the field im always trying to keep up with the definitions eg data science my colleagues and i are always guessing what that means edit ps its a little concerning for me to someone to claim they do causal inference and not have a deep knowledge of many of those solid topics and more so many fields have been led astray by inappropriate causal claims surprised there isnt more on judging model performance here either i guess if its industry and the analyses just lead the business astray its less of a big deal,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SmRPR0VFN3hHVnVydlpaMWlyS2ZMQ2xkWF9QSVFXU2N6Q1Axc1dvQ3NpU3hqdFFsdWpWV05pSkhrV3JVRzBtOXUtcTQyQ21BekMyOHFEay1rTkQwUUE9PQ==
if we stick with this definition of bullshit then in order for llm to not hallucinatebullshit there should be some sort of parameter that forces it to stick to truth eg a person that is concerned with truth will either give you the correct answer or no answer at all whereas an llm will always output something so if you could somehow measure the probability of a statement being true you could try to maximise that probability for all outputs but idk how can even begin to messure it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4RkpndWw4QlE5Zzk5eFdoREhRaHB0NWZneXVZNk4xQ0ZYLWMwbTZtS3BEc3hXNWw0dGVQTVNNUmZIVTJscERsTXQxZE1GZS1zd1ZmY0pUbnBteFpyM3c9PQ==

it always blows my mind that this is the traditional approach to onboarding throw them in the deep end and see if they sink or swim partly its an initiation ritual but its stupid as most initiation rituals are if they had even a minimal onboarding program it would pay immediate dividends by getting to the breakeven point on their investment in you faster it occurs to me that tech debt might be part of your difficulties and that might be a way to have an impact quickly as you are learning your way around keep notes on what you are finding that might serve as documentation and maybe your previous experience might enable you to see opportunities for improvement but dont suggest them right away wait till you have established street cred,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4Wkp0ZlhyWmFVWkNxbEdmYXV4dmdwNjRPRXRzX25KT190dDhqN1hYSkxjdGgxQUxEbkVxbjVPbTVJaUNBSFR2UUx2UlY1OVpvOFZ1X3BqVjdPSFlhOE5TSmNxN040bzAwOEZ4NmFwSzNmMTQ9

i would go down one of two routes <number> use historical data from past launches and modify it to suit expectations for the new product <number> launch the new product to a subgroup from which you can extrapolate performance of a full launch ab test in other words for the historical data look at past product launches you want to ideally find a similar product but it will never be perfect so just do the best you can also remember when you mode the impact of the new product you should take into account differences between the customer base now and when past products were sold seasonality such as time of year difference in the selling price and repeat purchase rates people will repurchase toilet paper more than a tv the more recent and relevant the past launches are the more convincing the forecast will be if you go the ab test route what youre doing is basically a limited launch so you want to be very intentional about the audience you launch to so you can extrapolate the results to your entire customer base this means the test group should have similar demographics and purchasing patterns and be large enough to be statistically significant also pay attention to how you notify the test group of the new product and what the adoption rate is if you just make something available on a website for the test but for the real launch you have a ton of marketing and awareness building youll get different results,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SW5UWnk0UnE0MExmSC1CWG9CZnhnRXRaOHZ0UHFveUFyTE5CVzBFdXdjVXpUbWxvWDl4S1VxRjlsRlRDN1dQR0xLeHdscWItRWdva29KcjIxMWdqNEE9PQ==

but if it only did that then the results would be literally nonsense that sounds good which indeed the first versions were in new versions you can ask it domainspecific questions and get answers that are almost on par with what youd read in textbooks as long as thats something that was sufficiently represented in training data we tried this with a colleague who asked it about his phd paper and it was able to quite accurately give him a summary of what it was about as well as answer some simple questions eg which methods were used in x experiment in the paper i asked you about before similarly you can ask it eg give me methods for how to solve kinematics in rigid body mechanics as taught in mechanical engineering courses with multiple degrees of freedom provide an algorithm provide an example for a system with <number> dof or what methods can i use to solve an oscillating electrical circuit using kirchoff laws or and this is the best example for making my point im working with simulink to create a software component that holds <number> different states based on a velocity signal threshold the state increases to a higher state every time another threshold is exceeded but only goes back to state once zero velocity is used suggest how to implement this consider both a simulink model and stateflow provide reasoning and subsequent can this be implement solely in stateflow its in my opinion clear that the architecture shows some emergent behavior that goes deeper than only prediction next words we can discuss whether the output can be valuable in any way but its imo not merely writing a document that looks like the one its intended to summarize its taking information from its training data and attempting to combine it in a linear way to fit users query,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WDViTTRnUWhsRFhQdVJnNVQ3WmhFNjNDcThKZzVnTVRtc3JNaDVUTmd3UmZxLVpJbGN1ak5XczVXUmNQR3lSQV9GaF9QaVFfRFp4TnFPNGJKaS1EQzRreHVaWGhZWlFFcVhrY3l6VHRZWjg9

do you know how retrieval augmented generation works the very simple answer is that they feed the users question into a traditional search engine then put the search results and the query into the llm so that the llm has more than the initial training data to use the domain knowledge isnt necessarily part of the training data so again the llm is very literally not doing a search the search is done by a traditional engine and then the llm summarizes it llms may demonstrate emergent phenomena but under the hood they do not engage in anything that resembles human cognition there is a reason theyre called stochastic parrots,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4M0dfNUdraGxrTW95UzlXOFlqcVhpLW1WQVFHVG9rcXBXcERER25vdGdNN2d0QWduWWxCS3IwNFdfX2FfbmFIdldYeVdoaTZIdlVIc2pnWUwzU0tJUXc9PQ==

>yes a more traditional search engine feeds them relevant documents but then the rag is used to retrieve information from the papers based on users query it is again essentially searching the information we fed it and picking some specific knowledge the user is requesting the issue is that youre saying that the llm retrieves information at the most basic computational level this is not correct theres a reason its called generative ai because it generates new text based on input strictly speaking i know its a transformer but that is probably too nuanced here ill grant that this might seem like semantics but its actually the crux of how these large language models work because the text is so good and humansounding we all have a tendency to ascribe deeper thinking or action to the models but thats really not whats happening the llm is not retrieving information certainly not in an information theory sense it is using the original result and prompt to generate a new document which most of the time contains a subset of the information that was in the input if it was truly doing retrievalsearch then that most of the time would be always so yes we do have a disagreement a friendly one i hope about the characterization of the model as storing and retrieving information the reason i brought up human cognition is that we all myself included have a tendency to project human thought processes onto the model in this case i think that hinders our understanding of what the model actually does,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4U3V4LVZEQU9hRjE3UHJHSDVkMFRKcFNLbTd2Q3ZYNlR6MmJaUUotWlNEVTFsOGQxbUZ5RzZaTTNZVTB3U1QyQXE0ZjJoMkttNUQyZkdXM1lDSVVrUnc9PQ==

i just finished a ms data science program <number> semesters it made a point of being more technical and rigorous than a lot of other programs they looked at other programs and designed theirs to fill gaps too hugely benefited that the ds courses were taught between <number> already wellestablished quant departments and their faculty hiccups as with any new program but overall good im overall happy with my experience and we did spend a lot of time with the math as well as using realworld data some courses sucked though and i had to spend a ton of time making sense of material but that was mostly because of the occasional crappy instructor that was crappy irregardless of what course they taught really only <number> problem instructors tho data analytics is much more wishwashy imo as it seems more like a plug and play approach vs something more technical that requires you to actually know whats going on under the hood at least this is the point my program made to differentiate itself you can dm me if youd like more details about my specific program,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SWJ4YXpaZnpQb3k2dGp4YXhwcEdGaVQ3M2pDMWJTQ1J3LUoyNVFPVTRrdFNtOHc4Y0tIejJuOXFTU1JQQVRmZTFRcTBkQmM1S2pUVnlPOUxueTlQcjJ1bTA5VkFBbGtlOFV3dmVKaWt2OTA9

i would agree with those here that say that your formal education mostly just gives you exposure to the fundamentals its your experience after that and what you learn there that is a difference maker i graduated with bsms engineering degrees <number> years ago since then i taught myself programming excel high proficiency there vba sql including things like stored procedures and automated workflows statistics r etc as my projects outgrew the limits of the old tool i had to find a new one to complete the project teach myself to use it and then execute i am <number> nowand teaching myself python i am already more proficient in using python to solve problems than most of my much younger peers in our company i did not contemplate learning this much coding when i graduated but what drove me was the realization that these skills were needed for big data and automation to make me more effective and productive and a host of other reasons on the job and through all this the internet became my friend in addition keep in mind that the further you are from that ms degree and into your career the less that ms degree will matter nobody is going to ask me today about what i learned in grad school they will be most interested in what i have been doing lately,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4d2RqbXdCSE1RcGZaVmQtUUJjcThoTktxWUJVclFSdXRTWHFGalZCWlVNSW00aFN2R3dkNHdaV2JTbzRIQks2WC03RW5aR18wU2NWR3ppYTJET21BcVE9PQ==

people may disagree with me but i personally dont think there is much difference i would get a masters in the field you want to be in for a long time because that masters will have people in that field so it will allow you to network with them to break into the field that interests you if you want to stick with data science make sure data is in the name if you want to go into more general purpose programming then look at ms in cs if somebody doesnt respect your ms in ds i highly doubt they would respect a ms in cs hopefully that makes sense you arent wasting money you are just investing in your future,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MzE5NkEyMHBUUmRCSThST0JmWkJqT3AxbC1DV0pOWGZMSC0zZnpIU3k2NU1YeVhmYnZnUDJpWTAxYVp4Y09TSzhKZFB0Ml9GUjRVdkgtbTlLQUI4MUE9PQ==
did my masters in data analytics with a major in ai at western university the course in itself is presented as a cross between statistics and computer science but i would say in reality its only for people with stats maths background to learn coding the majority of my batch ended up being a data scientist but there is a huge gap between what they teach and what actually is needed in the industry it only makes you skilled enough to build models and understand how data science works but lacks any teaching to make ai ml products that can be used as a production application i had <number> years of software engineering experience before and put together with the masters i chose to work in the ml engineering and data engineering space as i was not feeling confident that i will do justice to being a ds however i work with the ds roles today and help them convert the aiml projects into aiml products,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4Y3NmdTlScEtnYnZma1Z1MHhwS3VmcU1uM1RhSUVxYmdmVnVzUmNsMjVfeE0xVlBFWDdwQTBRRHNFbGNyTlBUMG5Ja2RiOHhnNVdNSFlqZExkTm83TkE9PQ==

its usually a business metric being considered also real world use cases usually require some balance of precisionrecall since predictions require a corresponding call to action or serving process to go with it and resources for these arent infinite example churn prediction you dont have enough customer care specialists to cover all cases so you might try to keep false positives at some acceptable level even though that means false negatives will be higher also in this case youre probably going to prefer a model that has higher auc under the precisionrecall curve meaning it offers you a better tradeoff between false positives and false negatives so you can allocate resources better there are also models that dont perform particularly accurately but if it keeps users on a platform longer and create a wider funnel for downstream stuff then that could be valuable too example content recommender might not predict with very high confidence that the user will watch any of the content shown but maybe it delivers novel enough content that a user will keep scrolling for more options thereby increasing time spent on platform and more ads viewed and then finally even if you would normally use a ttest if you see a nonstatistically significant <number> improvement in your bottom line are you really going to recommend switching to the previous model i think your question applies more to biomedical settings where its more like ok rolling out a treatment with a <number> nonstatistically significant improvement is a huge waste of resources so we wont do that instead we will spend the money on more research for a better result or change direction tldr it depends,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDY05nZEhSTHhxZWlUeFRqZGRXMWk2NkI1TXZmV0tLTHQwV1FEejhFa0huNnNibnJXZXF2R3ZLNEwya0xGMUx3VU1wU3JFdFpBWVZ4MFQzc0YzNW5fMFE9PQ==

thanks for this i think given your good inputs here and sharing of use cases i think the question for me is that are we really improving in direction because if not we can possibly lets check our methodologies i think even precision and recall can be resampled or bootstrapped to see if the mean precision of the new model is actually better than the mean precision of old model knowing the variances of precisions from the new and old models if we dont check there could be a high probability that we could be going in circles in the big picture thru these iterative improvements that arent actually statistically sound yet im just relearning stat so please correct my misconceptions if any,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDRXFIRm5sSWVZNk81aHBpTVJMbldqeXowaXFRNERjc0RVSGRJMGlPQW90OVJabzdRRVpDRk95ZnFkUEFPY0VsTGpCd2xrS2dBNG4wVkdybDRZREdSU3c9PQ==

by the clt error in an average is of the order stdsqrtn you can put an estimate of std either from the sample or with some formula eg for a bernoulli random variable its sqrtp<number>p you can substitute your sample p and of n to make a confidence interval but usually you just check your order of magnitude and be done with it and usually you only really care about this at all if youre comparing to a dummy model or something like that edit btw if you do iterative improvements you are at risk of overfitting even with significance tests multiple testing p hacking and all that,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDX09TZWdkdXRRWXZZbGZGWmk3blhHc0xtYWxyeXJrMWxJeHpnVzhqSVpTZVFWend1YjIyYVlKbjZDaUdHY1R1eUNSdFo0QVBlREVlTTJlQmx0VU9wVWc9PQ==

youre not really missing anything youre just undervaluing the benefits you try a bunch of different hyperparameters or try different models and you want to use the one that does best best is difficult to be sure about though because there are uncertainties on the value of your metrics you can counter this with crossvalidation or bootstrap sampling so people do this if your validation set is large enough the uncertainty on your error metric is very low and this becomes unnecessary however this is a really unusual situation for you to be sure your uncertainties on your metrics are so small that any perceived difference between hyperparameters is really is a high bar and not one you will often run into so <number> is rare your samples arent often that large and <number> is not an issue unless youre training crazy neural nets,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDRmpSQXhSS3lwMFJTMHRKNEpBNHdDOXZIRldBcG1kR1F4Y203TDB1UHkxNmRQcXdQY3Vkd2FPbWNqNVEwUllpZ3NEMXZzeFFfWVYxdkJ5bl9Cb2Z4Qmc9PQ==

for statistical significance youre just checking for significance not how significant it is which is why we have hypothesis testing can we reject the null hypothesis that the variable is close to zero thats what your ttest does the beta coefficient is the measure of how much the independent variable affects the dependent variable what this doesnt do is check for bias in the data or if theres an issue with the sample having massive outliers you need to check the mean and median to see if theres any semblance of outliers messing with your sample the closer your median is to your mean the better your sample is,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDQjZScTc2UGF6Q2U1MF84d0RYUGh6QVlHWG45SVhEdGkwRUJmNmdkbHJaQlZjemZpT1hnS0N0dGxWZnZkTzZDNURJTmN0bnpYS01MN0hlWUNXN2IyNlE9PQ==

ivs still remain indispensable for demand estimation outside of a context where you have experimental variation in prices presumably firms running a data science team can readily produce experimental variation in their own prices although not the prices of competitor goodsservices and use that in conjunction with a supply shifter to get a decent first stage on a demand system not ideal but almost everything in io needs an iv and we still havent done a good job of finding decent ones blp instruments yuck the only place where our models and estimators are truly credible is when estimating valuations from auction bids mostly because values are nonparametrically identified under fairly weak assumptions and the theory on auctions is remarkably robust,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDMTFrcElmMW1FUy0wM1F1bGd3Mi12TEU5aEhQbmtuZnIzU3Fyb0ZJUE8xVjdGaDBaQU5kcTAwbXlYX0xaaWk1VkhxN0NBOVFjdUtRSnplYzNKMlZ1YmtMb1hyUHJNVHRmdWRya0NUTDVuanc9

i can appreciate your defense of the role of ivs in the io setting and i can agree that while weak ivs can still provide some insight they arent the most reliable tool for many practical applications however for the purposes of hiring and screening applicants a deep understanding of ivs isnt at the top of the list of qualifications we prioritize in my experience most referees tend to approach papers that highlight a novel iv or a significant use of ivs with skepticism often assuming they are dealing with weak instruments rather than strong ones this tendency underscores the importance of focusing on more robust econometric techniques and broader analytical skills when evaluating potential hires,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDWVp1UmxpNWVXMXRyMDZkYVFKRHFQeVNUbXVrX0NLRllfbkpIbF9wMWJ4NUR5SWFvdk5RUzFKUW04OVlPbVFGb1dzMUhkUDN4MWsxSVRwSGRIT3Y4ZlV3eHdlbEREdXV1czJqUHhTZEdGRTg9
the strength of the instruments is not such a big issue since thats testable the exclusion restrictions are a much bigger problem and one where you really need to produce economic insights to justify a choice of instrument still its not entirely clear to me how firms do quasi experimental studies thinking ivs are bad because of difficult exclusion arguments but find that did and rd type methods are robust where you have a similar type of issue,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDRXpsOVNETGpVREZvMDZlcmgzcGJaSWYzWU9DOXE4LVE5Ul9oX3V5UlZuZkJoZWtFcG9zYTRZdXN3cl9ENFE1RTZUWWlhOVRDcldseFdzUUp0VzVwaWFqWHR5MXF6V1EweElBek5VdkRqOWc9

basically blockchain was a way of executing database insert commands these commands were mathematically invertible meaning that it kept receipts and that you could always verify that the insert command happened from this ip address and that the record was created over here the method relied upon a security token that had to be constantly verified to prove that the database metadata was accurate the token authenticated the record and identified who owned the database insert command the overhead of the security creates a significant inefficiency <cur> and electricity compared to existing databases and the problem it solves fully auditable database insert commands in perpetuity is not a problem that anyone actually has in conducting business,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYWtJcmVoTmNDRi10bDlIOVhKUjQwbEdDb1ZsOHRPOVpSWlRYUWdXX2drMkRjWmFESXBCM25IMkVzTkdvNm9CenQ2NGNYTGE4bk5xSk03WUYzQTdxZlE9PQ==
they are hiring data scientists but you need to be fairly experienced as they run pretty lean big problems in blockchains are usually infra related therefore data positions are not really needed at the moment blockchains are not designed to store info they are designed to store proofs they also need to work in an adversarial environment because of this the use case is fairly narrow but it is good at settlements and distribution which is what most companies are leaning these days,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT1phRTBEUG1RbHkxX3NHZ2lhWVpSYWhSUmhsdG9VcV83TzRCV0poaGVDLXJqZjFNUGhFSDlWcTVTRXItUlhmdFNCeF9iQWNuLXhPNlFQM0JtdzV0QWc9PQ==

i agree with the first two statements for the most part the last bit that inefficiency is most of the product because it cost so much energy or money to break the system is really secure i dont think the blockchain was made to solve business issues esp since businesses of today are explicitly platforms build around and for central banking ie solar power doesnt solve the energy needs of a diesel car but i think blockchain was introduced so people can start to conceptualize building solar powered cars or even just electric ones where you dont have to use the same framework we always used in diesel having trustless systems can start to allow people more freedom of movement in the future as they will not have to rely on large conglomerates to provide their basic needs and infrastructure but would be able to do so peer to peer but it is definitely not there yet,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdkNtTVBfZ09PVzY1QUpOUjVoYkExUzVTVXBFaGZqRVBHZ25adHhPMmN0M19TZ2RHQmh6ZnRwZHktX0ZsY2d5ck5OYVBTOVJ0N2E1X19qd2cwYzhzd1JFZDhJaXRJM01IMG0yUWRkelFEcEU9

when tackling the challenge of building an effective image classifier for a reselling marketplace its crucial to start with a solid foundation a clean and wellcurated dataset your initial step should be to validate and clean the existing k images which likely contain mislabeled and lowquality entries automated tools such as amazon rekognition or google cloud vision can swiftly scan and flag images that are blurry poorly lit or incorrectly labeled making the initial culling process more efficient complement this with a manual review process perhaps using crowdsourcing platforms like amazon mechanical turk where multiple reviewers can verify each images label ensuring accuracy through consensus once the dataset is cleaner enhancing data quality through augmentation techniques becomes essential libraries such as imgaug or albumentations can help create variations of your existing images through rotations flips crops and color adjustments thereby enriching the dataset without additional data collection efforts given the hierarchical nature of your labels structuring your classifier to respect this hierarchy is vital consider a multilevel model approach where separate models are trained for each hierarchical level or a treebased model where broad categories are handled by the root node and specific subcategories are managed by child nodes implementing transfer learning with pretrained models like resnet or inception and finetuning them for your hierarchical labels can significantly boost your classifiers performance especially in the face of noisy data continuously evaluating and refining your model is key utilize hierarchical precision recall and f scores to measure performance accurately across different levels of your label hierarchy this ongoing process should include regular reviews and cleaning of your dataset retraining of models and adjustments based on the insights gained from these metrics expanding your dataset with highquality images from external sources that fit your label hierarchy and maintaining a robust validation set will ensure your models effectiveness by iterating on these steps youll build a powerful accurate image classifier that can handle the complexities of a reselling marketplace,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT0NvY3Z1QTFXcGppUThsQmtEUzBpS0g1ci1SQ2hwZ1UxdGtMRHN2VGJMaGpjZ041ekRMWWtyR2tCWXJJanZHR2dFZDh6THRLT3Q1VFgyc0RuV3JpRkE9PQ==

also bringing it full circle once data compression gets better as it inevitably will and or block chains are able to store more data or have better means of tagging existing data the byzantine general problem which is at the core of blockchain will actually become an indispensible and powerful tool in ai fraud detection with ai now we can make anyone say anything and do things on video they previously wouldnt have done if someone say clones a world leader speaking and posts it online agencies will be able to prove whether they said or didnt say those words if the orginal video is encoded into the blockchain either by cryptographic hash that just points and says which is the correct video or having the entire video loaded in a database wouldnt be trusted source as much as an immutable public record this is something gary vee actually described but i just added the technical detail that needed to happen to make this a reality,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUGN1bjlkTTdEYmppRXFDSW01S2ZRMU1vbEVWYWxvWmwzUXRnbzVUYUpMLVVMSEQtX3RlbEZwc1c3dkJBaElYRE9ZUW92STJyYnNuejUyUFhTaW5ndFdnRVF4aGJpZGZucUotVklaNWtRb289

i feel like eventually we will have one or two remaining blockchains that are actually compatible with this purpose and people will just piggyback their databases off of signatures tied to transactions in that base layer that seems perfectly useful you just need to finally clear away enough of the hype profiteering rugpulls etc that come with the genre so that people only actually get involved in the field for useful reasons this may just come with time either through a reputation of cryptocurrencies being scams filtering people out of the market but im also hoping that eventually people come up with some template for a cryptocurrency that doesnt have this characteristic of giving massive benefits to early investors and isnt really useful as an investment unless it is also functional in other ways and then countries just ban initial coin offerings that dont have these kinds of economic safety measures so we can finally let the basic functionality remain unhindered,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU2FpQXNwNkNGc2pMenIyYmFZUmdtWC1BMUFUUTZqTmlDWW1ZYWdJb0RIcEREMkJLM3ZqdVozOWNKZEFJWk1KVi1PcGpaVEZsVWUtbS12ZXFLR1FoODNFNFFwUkpOY3RhbVItZWFxRzQ5VEE9

tou can definitely make money on this if you have a better model its not easy though the difference is that when most datascientists creates models at work there is no financial penalty for themclear punishment when their models are bad in sportsbetting you get directly punished for being mediocre > the natural randomness from the human sports this comment makes me question whether you understand probabilities certain outcomes are more likely based on historical patterns and thats what you are training a model to predict > the fact the the betting platform can do almost the same you are right they can but bookies pregame prediction models are shit as well rather the advantage they have is that they have data on succesful betters and how they bet and adjust odds based on this information > the platform will always have an advantage and the math guarantee that you will loose money in the long run nonsense,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMldTeEVWWWRRLWZJNjZ0b3FIR2pUbDkzV1BlR3lreDIzNEZSQ2xrblhJUjBwU1Z4YUdjQTAyakRCZ21OMjh6ZFUzbVBrRDZIcFNZaVRaOFBfUXZYUlE9PQ==

theres almost no realm where its actually beneficial as a technology for it to be decentralised though the only example ive ever come up with is luxury goods like gucci handbags or something where a certificate of authenticity minted on the blockchain with a wellknown gucci public key could verify reasonably well anyway that the goods are the genuine article all the other applications ive ever thought about have so many drawbacks or unhandled edge cases that it just wouldnt be worth it one example of it not working is land transaction records because of edge cases like adverse possession people dying intestate or not reassigning their land before they died courts wanting to issue court orders to reapportion the land etc,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUVRPVGVqMzhTeGlvVnZIR2RGdGVrMHhlQ1p0X1REdUJjRmphak51ZjVlUjBjRVRpLVRxR0pCS0EtU25yVVVpV2pFUVBFM1lnLUpPR0hiajNma0ZBQnc9PQ==

thats a hard straw man arguement vhs was not build for privacy so why does it enter the discussion but since we are here porn is actually a great predictor of what society will be doing because they are usually a head of their time in terms of communication and distribution because they have some of the most pressing need to widely distribute their material and have ready available buyers to do it they led the vcr and home video movement and were also the first to put content on the internet the started putting up internet content in <number> <number> years before youtube was created they were the first to make online transactions with credit cards available where porn goes the world often follows every letter in faang uses some of the technology that porn companies were the first movers on internet content online transactions home video and entertainment video streaming one can say that porn companies were the first movers on technology that makes a over <number> of the current sp <number> value we are all data scientists here or aspiring data scientist when there is a linear or exponential trend of multiple points over the span of over <number>+ years its not unreasonable to assume linearity and do a regression something may change but we have strong evidence it probably wont coincidentally porn companies were also one of the first to adapt bitcoin and crypto as a transaction medium odds are that may become a standard of transaction in the future of course it may not but the data shows a strong trend as a data scientist to put your feelings and comfort with how the world currently works above data that is very clear and in front if you is a bold choice to make here is a brief history of internet porn if anyone wants to read <url> also for any of you early adapters that want to buy items privately using crypto or other means check out anonshop <url> anon shop lets you use monero to buy anything that you can buy on the internet but you buy it anonymously even the site doesnt store your data as it uses zero knowledge proof to get the order shipped to you or an amazon locker near you you can buy things as small as computer parts fun gifts or even gold bars and you dont have to be doing financial crimes or selling drugs this sounds like an ad but i actually just think the service is really cool ive seen their development over the years and it shows one of the clear use cases for crypto you dont have to have nefarious means to be private thats why police need a warrant to search your car when they pull you over privacy is worth it even if you arent doing anything illegal this is an interesting discussion honestly,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaldwOU02UFNGNDZjaWxtRGxQXzJVODFTbmNsclpnSnlwQXRMcUtseHJ0TV94aVEtZm1xZmxxc2lERFdZMFlaN3VYN3lVSWZxNWlzUWFlUXMzNVl0Z2tfVjRqSkFhQ29OUzVZWTNkT2NIZTA9

also speaking of private trustless systems yall should check out anonshop <url> i put the link on the other thread where i was getting flamed but i think its a great use case for blockchain it lets you privately shop by using crypto and creating its own trustless system zero knowledge proof data entry so it doesnt even store your data im not an affiliate or make any money from it i just think its really cool and a great example of what blockchain is supposed to be you cant send anything illegal of course but you can buy unconventional things or conventional things that you would like to keep private,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacmNUZjJJRGxLcUttOExmNEtNdEN1bTcwMjVha1FLQU9BYlV5QjVtUW55OVAwSVhUV3RUTzZNTUdwS3pRWWhOc3pvRTBiUlRpNnlNblRMRTU2WjlXWlRCMk5MR0JUOHlDUTVaYnpGTEd1aTg9
you probably do not need a fully correct dataset first thing i would do is see how these images fare with a simple classifier think singlelayer cnn or stuff like that that is your baseline if you cant get that baseline up with a more complex network given enough time then yeah its the dataset but you should be able to do so because a bigger network is not only able to learn more rules based on your data its also able to denoise your data more so personally after a singlelayer cnn id go towards resnet<number> then convnext and then maybe some small vision transformer after each iteration youll get a new baseline if at some point you have no gains no matter how well you train the model you know thats the limit of your dataset after that you dig into it the first thing you have to do when cleaning a dataset up is a good gold label set youll have to go in yourself or hire an expert you trust to get that after that its just training on that then picking outliers from the remainder set and trying to label those at some point youll be surpassing the performance of your model i would personally stop once i cut the error rate to <number>th of the original dataset this is just my rule of the thumb so if you currently have <number> error rate then you do this until you reach <number> error rate if you have <number> you go until <number> etc after that point it would probably be not feasible to continue if results remain bad like you cant reach near that point you will need more data not more correct data just a bigger number of samples especially if there is hierarchy in the labels,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVEJxdHdXTW9KaXRuLVR0dkpadzNHTC0zYVdHampEb0s1cXJGYU04RE54dDk5YXF4UFBKN1lrejV2OVBfRExKTkFTUU5DbG5RWHBVODNlbjB6cXpJNlE9PQ==

so lets think about this certificate of authenticity thing lets also keep in mind that we have pgp so a coa could have a qr code that holds a piece of data that can be verified using the manufacturers public key the manufacturer is responsible for assuring us it is theirs and can revoke it as soon as you have some sort of coa that a consumer can see it can be copied you have a physical good how do you know that that coa goes with that exact item even if the coa has some sort of item identifier on it and the physical good has that identifier stamped on it what would it take for a knockoff to fake this a photocopier and a stamp nothing at all about blockchain helps here youd need a coa for your coa and that means youd need a coa for your coas coa it never ends,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY2hnWlRHR2lWM3pkUDdlU2pxM0h3bm9mTnJWOWdMSzhjUmxEVWU2NWl0M2dWTno2bk1LZTdwTWpWNFBFLUN6d3ZSRW1KaXpqMzVDZFFnVk1mQ0YxSGc9PQ==

crypto itself no blockchain as a concept yes it did exist and already branch out and reach many databases already in its own different forms the only way to have a performative blockchain is to have your distributed nodes by the company for that company but that kills the public part of it and by that time you might as well just have a clustered no update storage it will probably work in a lot of places just without that name and definitely not with crypto,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY0ZJOGZfZHFwTU0tX3F3bGRna2JDTWxqTC1CVU0xVXlPSG5YM0dMUlV0dFd6YmZ1YWRkbDVocEhoZld6amhUbjhnWU5Ca0JrVVVfREZuR1hqd2hjV1E9PQ==

an idea i had combining large language models llms with blockchain technology enables a secure decentralized and collaborative approach to model training and knowledge sharing each participant trains their local llm on private data ensuring data privacy and then encrypts and stores the updated model weights on the blockchain making them tamperproof and verifiable a decentralized aggregation process retrieves these weights aggregates them using federated learning techniques and forms a global model that reflects the combined knowledge of all participants this global model is then redistributed to all nodes for further local finetuning continuously improving through iterative cycles this method leverages blockchains security and transparency ensuring trust and integrity in the collaborative learning process,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVUVjOVdjRjNYOHFyYlpxMHBZV0luY1JHTDJTWHNvWGZsdU80Y2o0WHg2bVJuYjRMUEZzcDhybnByMV9EdmhVQXpicGR3VW92LTBoWWptMk9NQVFOUkE9PQ==

this actually doesnt matter all that much in order for someone to sell you a fake bag they have to have a real certificate of authenticity on the blockchain and be willing to transfer it to you that means they had to have a real bag at some point and then switched it out for a fake one the lack of the certificate would completely destroy the resale value of the real bag so theyd only be able to pull this scam once thats decent enough protection from the type of scam where someone will sell you a real certificate and a fake bag then as a second line of defence the thing that ties it to the specific bag doesnt have to be very complicated the thing youre trying to do is not fall for fakes that are massproduced not completely stop anyone from being able to make a fake that matches a certificate so long as its painstaking and timeconsuming people wont bother because it can only be used as a oneoff once they sell you the certificate they can no longer pull this scam any more something as simple as a stitching pattern that encodes a sequence thats in the certificate would probably do it,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTdoeGZPdEhZWHI1VFF3c0dnRWYwY3FaQWtRd1g0SndZS2tqY3pleEdqWmZvQ0ZfencxYWREXzdzWmd4RWFYclpWWUYzdTEzMTB1QUU1RXRlVzdlamc9PQ==
they cant copy the coa because its only valid if it has a chain of custody back to being minted by gucci on the blockchain thats like the only feature the blockchain has thats worth a damn they could upload the same data again but you can validate that its source isnt gucci and you know its a fake certificate the certificate doesnt necessarily need to match up with one exact bag though it would certainly help in the scenario were imagining a lot of the value of a bag is tied up in its certificate someone would have had to have a real bag with a real certificate and then sell a fake bag with the real certificate this would destroy the resale value of the real bag as they no longer have the certificate so they cant repeat this scam they do get to keep a nice bag i guess the real scenario that this protects you from is someone making <number> fakes and passing them off as real not someone painstakingly making a copy of this exact bag the thing that ties the bag to the certificate doesnt have to be incredibly complicated for this to be good enough say something encoded in a stitching pattern,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadDFLN2FCRG9PREdrZXF4NUI4bTdtcExRX3lnYXZmUjQzbURUV1hUaTdWOFBfSzdiRFA4b2xiYnpQdmRzR18ycU9OUm9NYVFLNW44alFuekZkYVNvcHc9PQ==

hi im the exactly opposite of yours im in the medicalhospital field for +<number> years and now i finished my data science course and have some certifications what i can tell to you is the hospital field have a little limited space in da or ds because there is a lot of assistance jobs you can do a big job with dashboards or predictions but in general their dont care i think they dont know the real value of the data analysis the time and the money saved for the hospital maybe in the big pharmaceuticals companys the game is different because there they give a real value in our jobs of analysis and the impact of predictions or anything like that in the medications can have a huge difference in the results so in summary its look similar but it really depends of what area of medical or healthcare you will be ps sorry for the bad english ps feel free to dm me,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTVxM2l1TUwyQndFWlN3UFZURVJHMmNnVWFDT2VfMWZZRTRFaG1xTnpscXZRWHA2V2JaZ0pab3NjMlhZLVBURDlGWEc3OUNIb1dONGFhTTZHY2hQWHc9PQ==

thats the hardest thing to balance in a project like that great product is built through rapid iteration changing as you learn as quickly as possible great software is built in the exact opposite way by building a very clear abstraction with consistent contracts and complete consistency no backwards incompatibility tons of docs and example perfectly up to date those are fundamentally irreconcilable unless you are an oracle know exactly where the use cases are going have nothing to learn imo its why frequently the second mover wins in software not the first mover its especially hard in a rapidly changing space i started as a langchain hater but we migrated our internal platform onto it quite a while ago and i think theyre doing as well of a job as anyone could,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLUVzeUFiRVhJc3FhMFZ2TjVFQmVZR01McHZhdnlERmdMVDhTcFNtaEtKZ1FBOHdaa3FUdE1xT1diUjJBXzJVb19ESzNqbHdQMjRkZGNLYXUtSlNuRWc9PQ==

what is your goal if you want to be on the cutting edge you get to filter through all the crap that wont pan out but you also see the good stuff first question is whether you can tell the gold nuggets from the corn kernels in all the crap you have to dig through only do this in areas where you have enough background knowledge that you can read white papers research publications technical blogs etc the newsletters mentioned in other comments make sense as a middle ground then theres me i dont like wasting time in the middle ground and im not paid to be on the cutting edge so i do not feel like i do a good job staying up to date but i also dont waste time on crap that goes nowhere my company is so massive it has its own endless internal newsletters hops on every trend every fad and i hear about every vendor that comes through usually before they fade to irrelevance generally if i hear about some new tool or technique from multiple sources for more than a month and its at all relevant to my work i look into it linkedin newsletters youtube actually i need a new yt channel now that ken jee is done thats how i figured out that kubernetes and rag are important,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV1Z0am51Qy1XRThCaS1WTXlkZ3BhcmpUZk9KaHRRRkx0c3ZWSG5ISjNoa3pEbl8xQlpYM25KbGFTNzdkRzE1UVUteXQwNFM5UDl5aGhucTJnMG94SGVqMjlJd1dMTFBRQW81Q3MteGpyUG89

it could have gone both ways i was recruited for a role at facebook but declined to continue when they were vague on whether i could remain in the midwest or have to relocate to menlo park i did go to a local startup but they made some poor decisions cut most of their us staff and sold to a larger firm i later found out that group at facebook was told to rto even most of the remote folks so it would have turned out poorly either way but thats less ds and more on how companies approach work and workers,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhS3kxXzg5OG9rVW9YRDEteU1ydVFaTHRrMDU3UmtCbVhMTDVpNm02Q1gxSTdpa3dtZHpTeFVQaHE1ei1mV0ZCWFFiTzVDeklGa0ttRXZJS1VtY3Rza1VLOXRuU3ZSbjVpSUpKUldael9xMW89

youre at a different point than i am im probably considered too old but you can still choose your path pick something you can continue developing in and ignore the rest that said every position thats open is seeking gen ai which is stupid because most of those companies dont know how to leverage value from gen ai i fear by <number> gen ai will look like blockchain did in <number> lot of people spent a lot of time learning it only to find it didnt fit in with their business models,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhb3FxS016MlFVSTMxQ2gyMjkwTDM0aGxvSXk1d0Q3bm9jUDhaVV9wWUk0UlplMFo3WmQzMVdmRFVydVJMamFFTm84cUREQ0dRbW1WUDZXOTVxVnUxMW83YlVXak9ISnR6OFVCZ2szQXlSRVE9

i think everyone goes this direction models dont live long i had built two fantastic models for a company then left and learned that my replacement tore down both my models as soon as they had something to put into production totally political whereas no one destroys a pipeline just to build their own even when youre at a company for <number>+ years your models will evolve the business teams will change their strategy the business will change who they target or their risk tolerance or their decision structure so my advice to you is that you made a good choice if you want to do things for a long time period make sure you get training in more than one cloud platform and keep your certifications uptodate so you have more flexibility,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSzNjQVpaeU5UQUtWOXJtclZLV292RFlWUXZNM2tTWThYZU83UUlabl95SVRJdFMzNXIyem8wWlBCRGNwcnJmZjFaZG1GMUpwWkdnT1hQakpQMUlnTl84MmZpMHNRV29CUXlTdGlGOXY2SVE9
im thinking of transitioning out of data science at least from the private sector i expect to be on the job market soon due to downsizing i have <number> years in analytics the last <number> as a data analyst with a data scientist title writing queries and building bi dashboards i have not put a model into production in <number> years because it has not been asked of our team but i have helped three consulting firms understand our data so they can build models for us i think i havent worked at a company that understands how to use models to generate value my most common request is to deliver a spreadsheet so a product owner can look at it and find insights it pays well but i dont expect to find another job like this because i dont have experience that matches my title is it worth it to train up in gen ai and try to find another private sector data science job should i be looking in the public sector where the work might be less political and more about problemsolving than justifying some projects continued existence ive always enjoyed mentoring and public speaking is this a reason to go into teaching maybe high school math or community college programming,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc2Q4UV94WWpheFJaaTBzdUV1SFpLeTNnMVl6eUhNbFJRcDJxLV9nMkVGQTVxazctdk8xandBNDZEYzAyMlplNU5iX0R1UGdrUlh5QTdNbXpJekZ5NlpvNVBESGsxdkZGVWxYX2h3REJmM1U9

i have a masters degree in economics and have taken graduatelevel statistics courses in an enterprise environment data science methods are often treated as black box where your understanding of math is less important than your ability to solve problems the mathematics have more to do with knowing the impact of excluding observations from your training or test set or looking for balance or imbalance in those sets yes at one point you needed to know matrix algebra to implement support vector machines or kahlman filters but thats pushbutton now and automl systems will just decide which algorithm is best for you my advice take the courses that are specific to understanding how to read results of algorithms kaggle has a great batch of them for free,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYnZnZWswSDBxSW5PdWxSTDBFMDYwX2RMcXZ3WGJzMFBpQ0NhVHhMRkFoU0c0amlnaS1ERlNLZ0Y3aEFhbHlnTWM0ZFA1OXE2bkREOUlMNVQyTU5kcnJucF9WblFlU1ZfWDd1RzVfZ1B5bW89

so the lab experience is an interesting requirement is it a research position where you would need to know experimental design the difference matters because health care data is its own domain especially when you talk about treatment finance insurance or public healthepidemiology those are all very different problems and very different sets of data id still suggest applying for the position at the hospital and leveraging your volunteer role to ask for an informational interview get <number> minutes with the hiring manager and ask about gaps in your resume and then communicate with that manager when you fill in those gaps with a course a project or even other experience your other choice is working by teaching which has a complex set of incentives but does not pay well it is easier to go from industry to education rather than vice versa because so much of the education degree focuses on the classroom rather than on building ml systems or supporting analysis ive looked at the reverse path leaving industry to go into teaching and it would be at least <number> more years of school for me plus unpaid student teaching a nonstarter for me as a midlife person with small kids and would mean a <number> pay cut is there a problem to solve that excites you id start there,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhakJya00xLXU1QzQ5QnRnTnQ0T2JxMUhBUm1nRXpuWkI0Z2pEQ0xtWkRUNDIzRTVySXFRTExZZmVWM0I4aXN1WkNzQU0wXzFuT2FDUy1iZGxmUmxRWkNOODVMNGktN004WDZrdTBNdENrbkk9
i totally agree that you need to follow the money to find the analytical jobs a hospital will have fewer than the hospital management company the hospital management company will want to do anything to improve on metrics related to reducing costs reducing repeat visits which dings them with regulators improving insurance collection improving patient outcomes which helps them with regulators and improving retention of staff ill also be honest that hospitals continue to shed staff through waves of consolidations and the loss of business to urgent care and outpatient surgical clinics in another decade hospitals could be a very lean operation so id suggest aligning with one that is diversifying by going into urgent care and outpatient surgery,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSWF5bXZzeE5LcEQzN1Z2aERMX2JMSzRaYmpnRjZETVlRaEZtbnhUZTJyR1dIM2E1UjBnekhER2QtUnNZWVRnUEY2U1BQOE84U0t5cC1QcDB6QW1oQ2xxYnBTdFZhRXFETUFLZVR2b3RCNlk9

i think the problem with staying up to date with such a broad field as data science is that there is huge false positive potential unless you are on the cutting edge of a really niche area where any news is relevant to your work you usually are wasting your time by reading things just because they sound interesting <number> of what you stumble upon might end up being truly useful to you if youre lucky my approach is to keep working with the current knowledge i have but keeping an open mind by constantly reevaluating whether my current approach is appropriate for my goals once ive identified some part of my workflow that appears to be a trouble spot model not accurate enough traininganalysis taking too long question im trying to answer doesnt fit neatly into standard classificationregression task experiment design not flexible enough etc ill simply spend a while googling that specific topic usually after reading a couple blogs or article abstractsintos ill have a general idea of the problem space common techniques used and hints of what to dig into to investigate further then i can just keep going until i find what im looking for with this approach i keep myself fully engaged because everything im reading is relevant to the problem im working on even if i dont end up using a specific technique having a more complete understanding of the area is great background knowledge and my false positive rate is very low for example i recently found myself wondering if i could improve my teams experiment analysis approach wed been using ols on switchback data up until that point which i was starting to think was limiting us because of the difficulty of modeling dependence on nonlinear features a couple days of googling on the subject led me down a rabbit hole where i discovered new ideas like gcomputation double ml generalized etimating equations targeted maximum likelihood estimation influence functions propensity scores etc now ive implemented some of this into our analysis pipeline and we are getting tighter error bounds on our inferences and are more confident in the results and now im the team expert on this kind of thing or the time i realized a project we were treating as a binary classification problem could benefit from understanding time dependence some googling there led me to the concept of survival analysis and now several teams use it after i introduced it to them so dont waste your time looking for solutions without a problem to use them on is a giant time sink that will make you go mad,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcGRkOFdudW5oSXJGLVdqTEp3WmI5eHVGRl9TeC1OVXhLN19xMFpJeTBOcDBBYU9JaElId1BuNERfTjF2Q1lCeHA3dEpQeWpvMGlDYVkzTFlwblJ5Tmc9PQ==

<number> agreed on the edward tufte recommendation ive been a fan since i saw my first sparkline decades ago i think im trying to ask one step more abstract than where to learn power bi taking that as an example i feel like i only even know these things exist because they get mentioned on this sub with a bit of a well of course everybody in the industry knows x and uses it daily and thats fair im not a data scientist there are bound to be things im unfamiliar with so i end up with a lot of oh ok i will learn that too moments bi suites are just an example it could be some specific technique for regression or something for estimating probability distributions like a comment is obviously wed all use data envelopment analysis for that and im on wikipedia searching dea i think thats maybe my difficulty articulating my question i dont even know what i dont know and so im asking more about resources for what to learn rather than how to learn it but i realize as soon as i type that that its just a setup for it depends,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWjhOY0ZZaUl6RmVTTzg1SktjR3doQ21tS3o4LWFOVTF6bjFESDV2RVE1dUVoQWxPRldlWnN4MjlxbzZpcENFT0ZpZjQxRmZqYVYzYWN5ZXlkR0Rlcnc9PQ==

the problem with fighting to be up to date is you become a beta tester spending lots and lots of time figuring things out and dealing with many headaches along the way or you can wait a few years then learn the tech what i do is i hear chatter irl and online this sub is a great source for chatter and then i keep a mental note if i see a new tech mentioned multiple times after around <number><number> years when i have some free time ill check it out and pick it up the exception is when this new tech is perfect for what i need right now and it is a godsend then ill learn it immediately so eg in the last <number> or so years from chatter on this sub ive checked out vscode polars plotnine and duckdb thats it poetry i might get around to checking out in a couple of years if im in the mood back in the day it was cuda in <number> python in <number> pandas in <number> cnn in <number> jupyter notebooks and xgboost in <number> spark in <number> pytorch and tensorflow in <number> plotly in <number> transformers in <number> llms prophet in <number> and sql from ferris buellers day off if you look at it there is a new tech worth checking out every year to every other year each tech take a couple of days to a couple of weeks to learn if youre spending <number> weeks out of the year keeping up to date youre pretty much up to date thats all it takes,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVTJXY29Seld2QUhjTjFQcHdKZjItdm80elYzR3Z6dmxuSS1IR1EzWEJyTmRjdmRscXZsUklyaHl6WFdrelVDV1B5aWJXZHp5NFcwQjNYU1IxdTRobHc9PQ==
