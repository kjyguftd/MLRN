any coding problem can be solved easily when you break it down into small pieces at first take a simple problem break it down and solve it with your own logic and draw a flow chart then add the codes slowly add pre andor postprocessing techniques and observe the changes in the results the inception is scary after solving a few exercises you will see that it is not that difficult i hope it helps,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTLU9tU1AtOTVOdEFzeVV1UktHemZzYjFGOEVBMkxxX1dJU2VFNjhYa0o1N251U0p1RVFBUlJmazNLOWFDNXBsVzU5anJUUDllSV9VLVU1TWNIdGdGM1I3TzFpSzBiZTc2TVhFN2ZTVjVIT1E9

linear regression is only accurate when the interaction between the two variables is linear a x + b x + c since linear regression is trying to fit a line or plane to the data if the interaction is not linear tho eg x^<number> + x^<number> it becomes obvious that you cannot fit a plane to it,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMGdlQWNDaXBZeENQWExQWUhWMkNyZGpwX0QxaVZXbXNtUEhRRXBudTNoYndTckV3QkRnbkpXbjBtTmFzc2laZVR2dkhvOGNmT09HSjZrcG15QXQ0dkE9PQ==
you can add more features to the data as combinations of x x to a certain degree k meaning adding the following features xx x^<number> x^<number> x^<number>x x^k x^k after that you can apply linear regression and itll find the interaction you seek and that is if the interaction is of degree h where h is at most k hope this helps worth noting that this will increase substantially the dimensions of your data,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWF9XMlV3blA4NWxPZGVFU3otU3hmSm1iNHl5M3laZkhVSFBKc0w0S1JoZnZDUjdLa1B1UEdJcmRFSldld2h5QUxIcnF4bGQwTjE2SVRrbjl6WWtPM3c9PQ==

as for any other field theres only one way read read cornerstone papers to get the concepts then read derived papers to understand more general ideas finally ask yourself questions and try to answer those an example i read the residual network paper ho et al <number> iirc then i check relevant related papers that include rnns by reading you eventually acquire the idea that the recurrence extends the temporal horizon of your representation that is by using a recurrent network your model can remember things from the past very very simplified explanation here finally you need to decide a model for your own project you ask yourself does my model need to remember things from the past if the answer is yes then you know that you have to use a recurrent network else you dont supposing that you need a rnn the knowledge acquired by now should be enough to let you at least try an implementation from scratch if it doesnt go back to the papers you already read eventually youll find limitations of your model and you will extend it by repeating the process,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdWN3QXBGbE1fLUZNY2RMUG1oVjZ2ckliajZIWEpuM3ZmMFRDS2V5cWhSazNodTJPQk5NbXlvUS1BTmFiY2VBMF91Y00zUTA3eG1oXzVXbFlhZm02MVE9PQ==

how large is your dataset in terms of gb i think the issue might be connected to the data loading do you load all data in the dataset init if so every data loader each worker will copy the data that works for small dss but if you have multiple gb and they get copied over multiple workers thats too much try to load only part of the data one sample or so for images you can find examples online that do the image reading in the getitem call specifically for this reason of course for tabular data youd need to be a little creative use a different format i think parquet allows partial reading and is a tablelike format,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTajh2dHFQcEs3UDVsS3A3dmVCR0tWRFR2d3FDY2ZmWS1wd1JrZTFtUXVNWHNfdXlEWUhPV0JXT3ViNFhhUi1JZFRfb2RjUWVJS1B1UUlkMm1ZMllyenc9PQ==

basically if youre resourceful you dont need to upgrade if youre learning most models can be run just fine on gb of vram if you want to use larger batch sizes during minibatch gradient descent you can further subdivide minibatches into subbatches and accumulate gradients as you perform several smaller forward passes just to address the possibility of anyone complaining about being limited to small batch sizes if this still isnt enough you can pay for cloud gpu which is very cheap compared to a new pc if youd prefer to own your own hardware imo the minimum hardware that would warrant buying would probably be a <number> for that sweet gb vram a decent cpu with gb+ ram anything less and you really might as well just pay for cloud compute because the current setup you have will perform fine for most simple deep learning tasks,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWGh2LVR0T0hHOUVRWE02ak5QUHIzX3lzeUxxN2VsdV9uZ0tZd01yUURDNVNkazZYMlNsRlVHZURwY1lqZk9kQUxYTmJySmx5MEUxeWQ0M2Y0SFlnTWZEZzRxQmJfRW1GeDJYMmd4Uy1NOTg9

i would improve my python general efficiency basic projects solving problems and gain a solid mathematical foundation in ml first you can also do some basic ml projects from kaggle as well if you dont know basic stuff like pandas numpy sklearn etc after your maths is good enough and your coding proficiency goes up you can read different research papers and try to implement their ideas or combine with your own ideas personally dont recommend someone directly dive into doing ml projects without mathematical foundation all you learn is importing libraries and knowing basic data preprocessing especially in deep learning having decent python and math skills is so essential you can literally build almost any kind of model you want in pytorch once you have a solid grasp of maths and coding,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTX1FPMXNGUWRmdkYxcUxvbE5oMGlqMG5xYU9aeno4c0pHZFhJQ0pkZkJKWGVzV19femh5emYyZXFhT1l1VkJiRXViUDhJWFFHdHB3d2s4bGh5cWF6V1E9PQ==

most models let you cast your images to floating point allowing you to use whatever precision you want at this point there would be no loss however should you for one reason or another chose to normalise to <number> bits the loss of information is exactly what is written however if it will impair or even be noticeable is entirely depending on your data does tiny differences carry significant information i would try with and without intuitively the more precision the better but sometimes reducing precision can have a denoising effect,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMG11dGRvNkdIbG9feTVaem8wWUZiYm0wRTRZQkRkU3UyTEoyd21lWTZ4UUJ1SlM4dV9xX1pPcTNvaEI2MEJRRlVqalhNMTVvaW5FbVZGRUl2Nm9xSkRVNVY2M0MzeWtwWDlvTjJqOWNYTTg9

you have to perform the upsample during inference because that is how you trained your model when you dont upsample the model is seeing something that wasnt present during training not sure how else to say that sorry if im not understanding but it seems pretty clear to me that you have to perform the upsample heres the paper<url> i used as reference when i wrote my version,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSk5WYWE5Z3hrNjBlQlZPS0dUbmI2ZC1iSkkyY0FGWFp4bnBFSl9fZ3VqQ1hnOXJrUlJZT1JBMnN2YnFUVGJxekp0MTF5a0xCRk1kZjNIR1lmS2hoRUE9PQ==

im new to the visual side so this is just a guess your model expects the input to be of a particular dimension if it isnt it will resize it as necessary but is winding up with blocky pixels an sr of blocky pixels is also blocky when you upsample the dimensions match and no upsizing is needed the sr works as expected to test this pad the input image to the right and below with enough zero pixels to be twice the orig dimension,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeTlUcjhmWHgtNlVsaWxpQzcwM3ZUN0ktaDVxYVRobEpPLUpzaWhDcXZnX08tMmpSQmtGMnFCUnVBMnFsSGpCa3I5eUxFWjFEM0hmeDFtVGhkS3ZhNHc9PQ==

i believe youre entangling the concept of input size and upsampling with a particular interpolant in terms of its effect on pixels in the input image as a pre processing operation if your model is trained on images that have been upsampled with a bicubic interpolant that affects the smoothness of the pixels in the output upsampled image as they are averaged weighed by the interpolant the filters in your convnet have been trained to expect similarly preprocessed content regardless of input grid size as an experiment take your upsampled images and then crop a portion of them and perform inference with your trained cnn does that work well i expect yes were not talking about input size were talking about preserving the features in the input images at inference time to be the same as in training,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUHBnVjhIclBIVUhGZzJGRGhiQU1qN1Z3R2UwMFBLeHNaVnV5bml5X2VGZFVYY1VPRTVxSGoxNWNjNHNfYlFOXy1HVFp3ZkZiM1ExajFDcDZPdG5YU2c9PQ==

again just guessing but if you look into the guts of the cnn model definition youll see that each layer is more than likely some combination of the following convd takes any size but the output size changes maxpoold takes any size but its output also changes appropriately convd and maxpoold are algorithmic and only have fixed parameters linear is for a fully connected layer and is a fixed input and a fixed output size linear is where your model weights go this is why the sizes for your linear layer are fixed to whatever the model was trained with i believe that if the image size is unbounded your forward function will fail since the convpool final output wont match the first fully connected layer input if you can infer with any sized image then something somewhere is adjusting the image size but without code we will never know,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUc0dkT0tvT3NteHVRU3NITnl1SC1sb1J5UDB0N1Y5WEZ3d0tqSkRaczJIbll2RnJaLXZ1dW9FQ0pTUlBjZF9WbGtGenJuZUFyWGt5TmdBQllyN09EUFE9PQ==

the key difference between convd and convd layers in dl lies in their dimensionality and what kind of data they are designed for convd this layer is suited for twodimensional data typically images it performs convolutions with a d kernel that slides across the width and height of the image extracting spatial features convd this layer is built for threedimensional data often videos it uses a d kernel that moves across the width height and depth time dimension of the video the kernel can capture features that consider not just spatial information within a frame but also how those features change across frames convd is commonly used in video analysis tasks like action recognition or d object detection in your case you have a flat feature vector so a convd is what you want,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdTNlRnAzYnl0ZWpYYTBVZFVrOEdsd2xLZzdvWmQwTzZTM2NpMlFUalRRaUhaRHpTcm82dDZoTFlSRGdMcGt5VnJPYzhKZEZFVy03ZkJPZjdjUkR3SHVxRWlmeU41MzRySm9Pa3VQTXhIVzg9

the choice is up to you when you design your network im aware of two ways of handling it d volume a video can be represented as a d volume where width and height correspond to the spatial dimensions of a single frame depth represents the number of frames or channels depending on the data format convolution operation the convd layer applies a filter kernel across all three dimensions this essentially captures spatial features like edges or corners across neighboring pixels within a frame and also extracts features across consecutive frames,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVYWV4QVQ3ZGNDWl9vOFNiRXlLMHZEVHhOMVBudjFuVF9CVnAwS05PeEk1c2Q0US1ZNTM1R1ZEYS1Ub0RyZDlOSm93a2tDOFhGaURPNFJSREJ3Z3VYYXJjc280aHhLeEJuTWlybkRwb19rMVk9

you bring up two important points here <number> shiftingup can cause clipping if we shift the gradients up too much thats why in practice we can also dynamically find the loss scale factor that doesnt cause such overflows eg multiplying the max gradient by the scale and seeing if it overflows in fp > <url> <number> while i dont have a complete answer here part of the reasons are the softmax function and backpropagation remember the gradients are the partial derivatives with respect to the loss and the loss we use is the cross entropy loss that involves softmaxing the given logits when we start calculating the weight gradients we first start the backpropagation chain by calculating dlogits then dw etc notice how dlogits because we softmax it is always a pretty small negative number we multiply this number with the rest of the gradients because of backpropagation and thus our weight gradients are bound to be pretty small too,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRWt4V2xBenh5aUFhdThxTnlNMFMxLXZPVVJPZjVtazE2YlRlczZIeExiNTZnM1d0bWtCNkM1WlZYbVZtMFdnVWxEeDZOLWNRa2oyY0wyMWZRZXRfOHc9PQ==

yeah maths is important particularly linear algebra calculus and statistics doesnt need to be to a super high level for calculus the topics that come up most often are differentiation partial derivatives the chain rule for stats honestly its all helpful but usually not as essential linear algebra as long as youre comfortable with using vectors and matrices to solve problems youll get by fine understanding backpropagation is quite important its surprisingly not that complex to code from scratch and there are lots of tutorials around for doing just that will likely make it click for you long as youre okay with lin alg partial derivatives as the chain rule you should be good to go,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcklBMDc3QkEtM2pmUXQ5TEZoeXhOY3dySFk1X0JSOHh6cGhkNExLTGtyc2JmbVk1SnpHTVFIbGhiLXNHN3owY19wTzVkejN3Q21Mb2VGUVlHZnJaX01TS0pJcE5kVEpDZDczcExfQnZOcTA9

yes it definitely makes sense language models learn a latent space where similar texts are mapped close together i always think of this concept in terms of eigenvectors this space implicitly captures semantic relationships between words and concepts in your dataset in high dimensions data often resides on lowerdimensional structures ie a manifold by approximating the manifold within the latent space youre essentially uncovering the underlying organization of your text data youve probably already figured out that manifolds tend to be much easier to analyze and visualize compared to the full highdimensional latent space this can allow you to identify patterns and clusters that might be hidden in the raw data just be aware that you this isnt guaranteed to work,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVR2c5cy1PWUVJRzFRbnByRjNEdWVNd0xpSUZlZmVtYW5hNEpCbkJvMmNrY0ExZjE4Xzh1MS1kbjRHdW9JZ0Z4YjhOWHQxTzh0N3YtalFDeVFrWFZCY2c9PQ==

as long as the nvidia gpus are cuda enabled make sure that they are otherwise tfpytorch cannot access the device i think those are the most relevant specs large mem allows larger models and batch sizes flopstops reflects the speed of performing operations afaik the type of data does not matter to the device itself since you are converting it to torchtf tensors anyways of course it is a matter of programming not to waste memory and other resources by using eg very sparce matrices if that is avoidable,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWeXVwOHJZT3VZazJ5MXBhZlpFTnpvalVOWHVVQkdBallVS2VvU3A2MWtkN3RPMGI0WjlrNmJNMXd6LXhXZnRGNXRRaDNJV3JsQjVWa3hUR2dxS0dETWc9PQ==

one of the biggest issues with dqn is qvalue overestimation and a target network that is updated less frequently helps mitigate this improving training stability you could gather learning experiences by performing actions until the episode is done and only use the rewards obtained directly from interacting with the environment monte carlo reward to determine vs+<number> for the equation qs a = reward + gamma vs+<number> but this approach is giving you a highly biased estimate of the actual value of that state because you only observe one sequence of actions and the corresponding rewards from state s+<number> to the end of the episode there are many possible actions and outcomes from s+<number> that are not considered which leads to both high variance and bias in estimating the true value of vs+<number> with the approach i think youre suggesting,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbTNrdVN2NVZfRlB5VHJqNEdQc19zaFgzNmtfVlIyV2c2aWVzYmVQOUhWd2hnejJxYWZESnFGRnRjdmJRbGRYME1rSzZNZnYyUjBDd0JvUDJlRHF0NGY2eDZQUGdCUUVjNUd6R2RBVWVOZ3c9

regularization eg l l dropout etc constrains the parameter space making it less prone to overfitting by preventing the model from becoming too complex this constraint can make the optimization process more efficient in some cases as it prevents the model from exploring overly complex solutions that may not generalize well however the statement youre referring to is specific to the phenomenon observed during early stopping<url> where parameters corresponding to directions of significant curvature tend to learn early relative to parameters corresponding to directions of less curvature this statement is more about the dynamics of optimization rather than the effect of regularization per se in the context of early stopping the parameters that correspond to directions of significant curvature ie where the loss function changes more rapidly are likely to learn quicker regardless of regularization because updates in those directions lead to more significant changes in the loss function regularization might influence the magnitude of these changes but doesnt fundamentally alter the curvature,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOENTLWkzQk95T1ZQVWFkSGppVjNEOThYaVdIakRsRTRrYzg2b0VHSENmeWQyZFg1dUtYUnVaUWFQZzRsWFFMcTAxazY2aVpMNkhOaERfR0FXQndWMWc9PQ==

i agree and feel that is what goodfellow is getting at but i think there is a hidden assumption that the learning rate is small enough for that direction to op the classic visualisation is a long narrow sloping valley in one direction of high curvature the minimum is very close in the direction along the sloping valley the minimum is far away low curvature means that it takes a long distance for the gradient to change to in particular to reach zero = minimum considering now gradient descent whether you learn early or actually jump from one mountain ridge to the other ie overshootoscillate depends on how big your learning rate is relative to the curvature,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjclhhZjUxVFNHV0tuSmdPMWMxOGRZaWYtLXdSYWpXODM0VWtRSTV4djZkclcxTWRhRVdTRkhEODlsVkwzQlg1QWhaQl9lNUZhOXc2ZlBVX1JQTTRxRkE9PQ==
i would suggest this first obviosly price is the label so you dont use that feature as an input features = columns other wise you will bleed info into model and always get a near perfect prediction rate use domain knowledge or common sense what would make the price of a property higher here you are lucky the feature names are straight forward and not cryptic i would choose an x amount of features the ones you think are the most intuitive area no bedrooms car parking as i know this is becoming a problem in big indian cities and a few others dont choose all intuitive features for now the main objective is just try to get your ml pipeline going and spitting out some result without overthinking it then tweak it with all intuitive features im assuming price is a continuous variable so you would use some sort of regressor algo now instead of relying on corr matrix there is some algos that offer feature importance also you can drop in and take out features and reitterate to see how they help with accuracy u may need to do some cleaning on the data how ever if not real world it maybe clean,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbDRZSHJHOTlIc1YzN0xxanIwZzVocUV1Y0lNQkxLUUJVZy1YRElSMnlMVFp5VnZaSmNmWDBaRlFaMmtEUS1zVktVZmtfdUR1ZzlVdldtN1JqUEFlcGc9PQ==

if this is just for research purposes and you wont be deploying anything on devices then go with pytorch i use both tensorflow and pytorch the latter is more pythonic in style so it should be easier to learn the former however is more developed and has better support for deployments anyhow tensorflow is losing developers and will likely die out in the future,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjX0tSWVdQWjhYSlB2bl9hZktIclhPYVg0MG56SjVpNFBtN3JJMUUtbFRHcGY5MXNqSmxEcldOOER5NnAzdEk5aTBveXIzcjNZTkR2c25DMXAyN2hlY2c9PQ==

they might be using accessibility features but not every app supports that or they could just be feeding screenshots to copilot and controlling the mousekeyboard both are things anyone can do they did also show special hardware to run models locally which is a win for both parties users pay for their own compute load instead of in the cloud and in return they get better privacy,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjUVY4UThWVkxmZENwR3lkV2EzWHFxczktck1NbFgtZHc3ZlZJaE9PVWpsYng1cm9BVkVuT0NsWU1jOE90QkNFX1AzSHZXQzhiZ0IzMmlKRDBxNUxqbUE9PQ==

uhermaneldering thanks for the reply yes i think you are right screenshots + maybe some scrapping web scrapping for web requests maybe yes they changed the hardware to run models locally but from what i heard the privacy concerns came more from the new recall function they added which allows to come back to old sessions this records actions that are done on the computer and saves them so that recall can work + the copilot knowing whats on the screen and being able to execute some things especially if its connected online this is just from what i heard,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjXzVrRUdzN0dTb0R5S1pjblpDckhzOHBhWTBVRlVQaURNanp4cnAwSFI1aGthQ1lueHdVWXl2VUJZcDZFS2VVUk4ya1hidVR6MnJRTmNpMlVsa2dFc1E9PQ==

i think there are two options to consider here on one hand youre right in that if your model is only trained on <number> classes it can only show the probability across those five classes however you might find when the new class is presented that there is no clear winner usually because cross entropy is trying to produce probabilities as close to <number> as possible you end up with a probability distribution over the <number> classes that has low entropy eg one clear peak and low scores for the losing classes when the model isnt sure sometimes you just get the entropy spread across the classes and the winner is less clear that is one way ive found in the past to extrude confidence from the model though its hacky and not a universal behavior the better answer is likely to explore a zero shot approach zero shot object detection has made tremendous strides look at grounding dino or glip they work like clip where they contrast natural language with image embeddings but in this case to localize the things in the language phrase they are quite remarkable from my experience with them and likely will solve your problem without having to retrain or to use it to weakly label new classes as they come up and go back to regular supervised yolo,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkUUZjeUpwaGF4VzcwMW5VUlpZS3FybURhUjk4OV9QREFSM1gyaTRtQW1fLXFTQlNiLVc4NE1IYlJnOTY2ZjNyYl9Wc1lsMFdSUUdSel9uYkw0dGRwV2c9PQ==

for tabular data would highly recommend classical machine learning methods and familiarising yourself with those if you havent already these methods include linear and logistic regression decision trees svms kneighbours random forests boosting models etc these methods are more simple interpretable and less likely to overfit than deep learning models not only this but they generally perform better on tabular data too the book hands on machine learning with scikit learn and tensorflow is an excellent resource for this and also will answer all the questions you asked,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkUndDWUcyWDFiTGhJc0lERzFlYWZqRks2QVloR0FHb2FzNkQ1Q3oya1c2R3p2X256ZDNqWFVTdVZtcmVPQ2laSUY5NF9tUmZsbk4xb0NYWFdZTjBQRHdnb2V5N0dnakhPSjJUSFEyd0xWZUU9

this can absolutely be a pure linear model yes the op is asking about deep learning approaches but the point that was being made here is that the op really needs to learn modeling in general in addition to deep learning i would guess from the post that the op has a life sciences background and not a background in mathstatisticscsengineering the point of modeling is to generate the best model what is the best model the one with minimal error on a test set the most interpretable model it depends on the problem it does not answer the ops question but this was still a point that needs to be made as an endtoend researcher in modeling that uses deep learning all the time when necessary i see students all the time that cant explain the basics of linear regression but want to go straight into deep learning,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZHQ4UDJxdEhGRXU0U0tNNUc4NmxUdnEwNGExeEhnY3JvcUZ0bV9DRjZORHFjRTZwWDY3TmJpQVdPbGVnejJNbDZMTGkySFFMQmgwYWVuUzRnaW9JbTQweEVlN3ZXZURFTWUtU1VBUEtQd3c9

to respond to this and the deleted comment did you even read ops question very polite yes but admittedly didnt read as carefully as i could have also think your proposed solution is sensible and should work but still dont think deep learning is necessarily required and could quite easily end up overfitting especially on smaller datasets and will further be much harder to interpret than simpler models there are going to be trade offs one approach isnt unilaterally better than the other suggestion to learn modelling with simpler ml algorithms would you not agree that it is a more sensible progression to first become more adept in data science modelling and simpler nonneural networkbased machine learning before moving onto deep learning not doing so will likely result in overengineered solutions and a weaker understandings of ml fundamentals,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTDYwZl9DLXFqbzVfZVc4aUhnbEp5OER5bURYakpMWTktbFgwaW5rdEs4NnIwYklYNjcxdE9OT3o3WnlJT21mYlAyVl9GUHREX2hTQ2UxZU9seXpPczJJT01jSHhKWjlUdHVucnY2VlJHdzQ9

where did i delete a comment i dont think youre even responding to the right person as i didnt write anything other than asking if you had read ops question which you didnt my point was that you didnt read ops question and instead provided a copyandpaste just learn the basics response instead of actually helping them in any way and now youre just trying to doubledown on your original mistake,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZld6VXphSEQwWGhvcEVWUjYxekY2X3RmMXJvM09sV3cyZUtUMFcwVTBPbjR5dENtbjFHMDFITTM0cDZQOEczMmNiX2JpcHpYR2NLbDZQWk4wZ3dNdXFXeThBYkszTC1KZkFmcmZpYVhSVkk9
right it was the other person who posted the lstm model that deleted a comment that id typed out a reply to so my mistake there regardless do you really disagree with the suggestion to learn the basics data preprocessing and modelling are important fundamental skills that op asked about and both are covered in the resource i suggested it is a bit of a cookiecutter answer yes but i think most deep learning practitioners would agree that learning ml fundamentals before jumping into deep learning is the right approach,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlajR2My1wbEprV0VhVEFSc3ZfVWZlWWlJWGJpVGFtVGlwWWg0NzBXVWY1bzZWX3RwaDFSODZfNXdnSVdLX1FGVXJjQk50blpzTG9Eb09VSk10ZnlHZDlXSXhHTXZTZkdqMkd4c0puai1NNEE9
so two mistakes on a single post didnt read the question and cant even respond to the correct people i prefer to answer ops question instead of inject what i believe to be the question you didnt answer the question that was asked period at best now youve created confusiondoubt for op for all you know there is a dl requirement for this problem and thats the point you do not know what op needs i do research at mits media lab and part of that job is assisting people from other disciplines in my experience it is better to answer the question being asked not some version that exists in your head you can always answer followup questionsclarifications,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleUVlb0xPYmVoem5WTnF0UmZ5VFd3akgyWXBPbW9lRHNhVUtxYndKVENsNm8wSmJtT3o5OEliZmRqRWZIMFVyTHQxcGRnajhJR0tibElPN1h3MmRQemR6YUtmWEJ0MWYxTXV3RjJwME04UEU9

perhaps it has something to do with the way youve comported yourself throughout this entire episode you didnt read the question you didnt answer the question you responded to the wrong person and you are still sticking to the just go learn linear regression answer you havent added a single thing here and now op is probably unsure how to even proceed or respond i wont be surprised if they just delete their question and will think twice about coming back here for assistance excellent work,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMHB4X0hLZnNKd1RkalFtXzJLMUxIUm4xdG41b3N4TzRzVWZDVzQ4QmxibWs5VUxIcG1NVzRJVE9BZGhReWJneVdBMVR1LUhVcm8wNlM2WDBVa2ZjY3hidjItbktrUFBIeXYwUFBZVkhvTk09

haha really great question when we mean the picture is divided into the grid we just mean that that the receptive window of the final layer sees that part of the image but bear in mind the classification and regression heads are a fully connected layers because theyre fully connected it means they gather information from all of the patches aka the last feature map or in other words these patches are more for us the ones training the network to keep an order of which output to assign the prediction to rather than how the network sees the image its a way to keep order for us in reality the output heads still take multiple patches into account when making the prediction bcs the head is fully connected,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlb2ZUdDFJUDVKOU55MWMxQzVyUEtWMlBqMHU3NFo2SGM1UnRGaEVoMGVMa0NVYjRWM243N2VRN0V1cktINGRmMnNndkVEVExMQTlBMlNNdU9NZnR4LWpXQWV1Zkc4UjZYRGgwbVdQLUlVNXM9

thanks i appreciate the recommendation to start with classical machine learning methods for my tabular dataset however i should mention that i have a large dataset with over <number> variables and more than <number> cases given the complexity and size of my data i believe that deep learning models such as rnns or lstms for the timeseries components combined with dense layers for static variables might provide better performance additionally i aim to identify potential risk factors that are not yet known which might be better captured by more complex models would you still recommend starting with classical methods in this scenario or should i dive into deep learning models directly,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlazJLRFViYnQ4QWl3Mm5XN1VxMXdEdUR0TldSQzRNWlA5MVpzV3FHc0l5Tk1YQXk0TWJYVjRubThHSEtEUzVveWItQkN5ZkRpMXdZaERDTXd1WHRnM2FFU2RudG42RU1QallkTHpDaXBjRU09
you are right to give some context i am a medical doctor with a large dataset and my goal is to predict complications and identify potential unknown risk factors i just started my phd but im familiar with the basic statistic methods i believe that due to the complexity of the data and my goal deep learning might be more suitable but please correct me if im wrong you raise valid points and i hope that by providing my context the nature of the problem becomes clearer it needs to be interpretable but also as accurate as possible since its a medical issue the challenge i face is understanding how to process different types of variables static and continuous for example consider a blood value that increases over time for which a threshold is currently used in the clinic to determine if a complication is present i want to create a dynamic prediction model using deep learning to see if there is an interplay with this threshold allowing us to confidently predict or even foresee complications earlier,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlOTBMbWZtS1V2VVFzWWYtSGp6UXNNc3MxZEZMaEt4M0lZRnZNM3FGRHAzNVZ1ZjZ3UWdOTGFSeFlfSG1Yd01kVkU4blpINzlSQmdfMjdydUhnS21wbzMzWDAta0JCREJTaElTV1BUcnVuTGM9

hi thanks for the extra clarification a few further questions how many data samples do you have ie how many time series sequences and static variable sets do you have deep learning systems are much more data hungry than the conventional ml methods i alluded to if im not misunderstanding and <number> cases is <number> samples in total this is likely not going to be enough data to train deep learning models on how long are sequences and do you think its important that a model is able to remember parts of the sequence that occurred a very long time ago or is the salient information most likely to be that which most recently happened how important is explainability deep learning methods can perform well but are harder to interpret than simpler methods a complex model may be able to model more complex risk factors but being able to identify what those risk factors from a trained dl model could be challenging with more than <number> variables youll likely be interested in feature selection which is another topic covered in the book i suggested would still suggest working on some classical machine learning projects there are loads of open source medical datasets available online to practise with kaggle has lots a nondeep learning time series model worth looking at is arima which could be used in conjunction with another model for making predictions,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlYXAtZDJkSTJObzV4MWE4TVNRVUtmSUNHbnVuaWxZZDdDMzdwbnAwbzIzTzhLMmtZeGQwTUJWenFVYVEwdExPRWRnbkw1eTliWnBLSWFzMnNFT0swX1FyQ29ybEZBUzJ6WEhnLXI4U3h2NzA9

without knowing exactly what you are doing id suggest modify your learning rate or utilize a learning rate scheduler<url> ensure youre not working with imbalanced classes as this can cause the model to favor the majority class resulting in poor accuracy your model could be over fitting if that is the case you can use regularization techniques such as dropout and monitor the validation loss use early stopping based on validation performance to prevent over fitting are you using the right optimizer for bert adamw is commonly used with bert models,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlX05ocDV2bVpvc015UEt4UU5TbHlSMlRiREtNUVFFbFM0N0lEZDRrcTNVWWZLVnlzcWFlSUU4emZIckRVaGtkbFoyZThMWkVyUTJOelZ6TzJuX1RROHc9PQ==

smote is not appropriate for timeseries data if that is what youre referring to im not of aware of a technique called smots if its something like tsmote which im not very familiar with i would be careful using it as likely has several hyperparameters which need to be carefully set for your particular signal type if i were you id focus on getting more data or a pretrained model for transfer learning,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSjNwVmZKdXBWMDREMVFWOEVsU1ljcjRxYkJvVjhheXRxNThFUS1mSVh0SExZTTZIOW1rMnFMYzJCbThsRk9HSndhZTJKUHJVM1hPXy1vS3BpWHhFZGc9PQ==

as i understand it sleep stages are essentially defined by eeg activity so i think another sensing modality is less likely to add meaningful information also adding additional features increases the likelihood of overfitting especially if you dont have a larger number of examples to train on again id try to get more data preferably or a pretrained model,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSGdoRTY2OFpPREs2MmU3Nzktb0czUzZBNjRhZDBNdl81NWs4clVYWXExQS1TOGx5TGRhcXJ3MEo3M2xpdnFtUi1GLVRrT2xMTkRNdndsaW9sN05RUVE9PQ==

then its probably fine just train for as long as you can it could be that your dataset is just really noisy and the model needs time to distinguish between noise and useful information you could try an speed things up by increasing the learning rate i personally use up to e<number> if the batch size is really big and i have gradient clipping in place bert doesnt seem to diverge until e<number> or so so i guess e<number> or e<number> couldnt hurt to try and speed things up this phenomenon used to be called double descent now people call it grokking in short the model first overfits very hard and then generalizes example <url>,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmT2dhU213Yi05bm90eUx5c0FCLWctQm52SjlTU1ZUMlRRa2VpcGY1YS1YUXRnSFhIUWxVV0NRczhLeGJYalFnalZqdXlFaFpqVnpTZlpmRURNNkFBbmc9PQ==

why not incorporate the concept of other from the start if you know ahead of time that its possible your detector will receive out of class inputs then show it during the training phase what those will look like you cant just give it noise you have to give it data that is representative of the domain so if youre looking at images you dont just want to insert gaussian noise because you arent likely to receive that as an actual input instead you want to include images from the real world or the real world as this application is likely to see it train it on images of things that are outside of those <number> classes and teach it what things that it will potentially be asked to evaluate that are not of those <number> classes looks like then when it comes time to inference it will be able to say thats not one of the <number> things i know its something else but i dont know what,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmb29tcHdaUXhNTjE1cldaYnEzWFdWX2MwRXp6YnJWMkFlTFExUHo1eURnM3VFODhfalhNRFVycXA3WmZvMHdnTXFNNlhFbmMtam4wMEtfZVh0aUxiaGc9PQ==
so a generalized model to detect unknown class labels merged with the actual data yea in that case need to get similar looking parts which wont be used in production in future if they introduce these parts it would likely mess up with model unknown class and actual class have similar data distribution model should work super hard to tell whos who,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmTGRGQlJTQzRYdnM0cjNSUjZhNFJmejcta1E0Q1dBdzhPVHVDMmlDZE1yZ0ltQ0txRHhXTVNycnlfbktlV2FFOWZDTGp0U01UV25LOTE3N1NYRjlPalE9PQ==
well by introducing the existence of realistic out of class or scope features into the training set youre helping the model focus more on features that really are dinstictively characteristic for the <number> in scope classes its kind of like teaching the model the concept of nan you need a way to represent it if you want to be able to respond to it youre always going to end up with mislabeled data but if its possible that a model will be presented with an input that is out of scope then a model that has no concept of out of scope cant do anything but treat it as in scope because thats how youve built the model once you loosen up the model to understand that its possible it might some day see things that it shouldnt have to deal with then it can say thats outside of my scope reject sometimes it will give you a false negative particularly as you mention if they redesign the parts in that case youd have to retrain the model on the new parts anyway,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmZ1o3ODVjcTI3bnVua3RXYVdOZXAxT2ZZUjE4UldMdDZqSjVqMVprcGZ5dHlCaVZmVjI3RnpkMTF3WlFZZGdYSXhOVlo0azRRdE1rbUhZdlIwSXhMQVE9PQ==

for very simple models it is straightforward for example in linear regression with just a constant your model consists of a sample mean over the observations ie bhat = <number>n sumi yi if you want to remove k observations of bad data denoted yj^ just do bhat^ = bohat <number>k sumj yj^ and your new model has removed the bad data from memory this idea generalizes to the multivariate linear regression model theres a bit more work involved but one of the things that makes it feasible is that there is an analytical solution for estimating the model the good old ols estimator but for a transformer architecture estimation is done by numerical optimization and of course the model itself is highly nonlinear and has an autoregressive component there is probably a method in the theoretical sense that even a transformer architecture would have a linear model equivalent in a high enough dimensional space but implementing such a thing in practice is very much not feasible so is it theoretically possible probably yes but practically almost certainly not,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsbVdHS1Q1czZFMlhjVGwxbFV6VWZIRHJJS2xsWkctdGpObTBRUkF4NlNaUlluSFY0SW1HeG5VMDNka3RwT3B4UWRmdU5HRTRvYldjQlFRdzhSdEFqS0E9PQ==

nah i mean it literally in the mathematical sense for the simplest possible model a linear model with just a constant simplest possible model can be written y = b + u and the ols estimator of b is just the sample mean bhat = <number>nsumi yi now lets say you realize that some of your observations are illegal denote them yj^ you can update your model to a new model bohat^ = bohat <number>n sumj yj^ by construction bhat^ is just a sample mean over the nonillegal data so you have quite literally removed the illegal data from your model now obviously this is all very trivial when your model is just a sample mean it is a bit trickier but doable when your model is a multivariate linear regression model for more complex nonlinear models we can call on the fact that these models usually have a linear representation in a higher dimensional space however for eg a llm transformer the linear representation would be really really really absurdly high dimensional not to mention complicated by the fact that the transformer is estimated by numerical optimization rather than an analytical formula hence my comment about it being pretty much practically infeasible for this situation even if it is theoretically possible,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsTHBxLVZveWRZNWJqbTAtcWtWM25STHh4VFNDdzBEc2dFS3doTkwxVmVyOWRkeWxVbUx5aTA1UldNMTBsWnNDZnplNVJ1bW1panduc3o4V2pRSGFTS2c9PQ==

the triangular mask does not do anything for solving the order invariance problem of a decoder transformer except for the very first output tokens representation which would only be taking the first input token into account what the tweet is saying is that it still works well not that its order sensitive its basically saying that you can use a bag of words vector to represent a sentence prefix when predicting the next token in the prefix,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsTEZ1eW1kYWs1ajg4MjNGY29uTEI0UEZ2b05IVHZEZTFicHk2TlZuWDJBLWZRZXRXalgtbjN0cGo5YXBKOVNLVU8tWV9GaFc0SE5TN0hZSmhwQkhWbXc9PQ==

a transformer usually doesnt concatenate all the word vectors in a sentence into a single vector but always provides a separate vector for each word what that first figure is probably showing are the different heads of a single word being squashed into a single vector the multi head attention works by giving each word multiple vector representations the first vector of a word will only interact with the first vector of each word the second vector will only interact with the second vector of each word and so on for each word these different vectors representing one word need to then be concatenated and squashed into a single vector so that one word is represented by only one vector this allows the different information gathered by each vector to mix however at no point would a vector of the first word be concatenated with a vector of the second word the word vectors are always kept separate this is to maximise parralisation across words which one of the strengths of a transformer,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsWkJBSWNhYXVsY1duclEyNTlUWXZlVDYtRTV0dWRGV0xRblgwVjU1V0t2NVE2RDR1TDFOLW5kTU5DRGlzczlSZXBzdEljdjlucTdMR0JHNzFjVkxOZWc9PQ==

everyone is barely answering the questioni think the confusion lies in either <number> the definition of equivariance wrt input permutations positional equivariance or <number> how the linear layer is being applied <number> equivariance in this context means that if we swap the position of two input tokens the outputs will also be swapped at those positions now looking at the transformer block we see that each token is processed in the same way token i updates its value in selfattention by looking at the representation of all other tokens and then we normalize and feed it through the linear layer this linear layer applies the same transformation upon each token which means the output of token i from the linear layer is independent of all other tokens this tells us that when we dont add a positional embedding the output of token i is positionally equivariant <number> note that each token is processed in the same way by the linear layer it doesnt matter if the linear layer is a permutation matrix if so this would only change the position of the features within a single token however all tokens would be transformed in the same way regardless of their position so basically there are two positions the positions of the features within a token and the position of the token a vector of multiple features the linear layer is not positionally equivariant with respect to the features within a token but because its applied in the same way to all tokens it is positionally equivariant wrt the tokens themselves,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtTFktWHZqSE02T3FPMjRMNWxRNGs1STdiamxTMjZQdGdUekRrWXlSem9GVFQtX0FuVDFfcUhNYkRuZHlpUW9zMFVvaVBUTU5WaDNZY3oyTkJlTTNqcXc9PQ==

as advice start with deriving the forward and backprop equations for a simple logistic regression no hidden layers then with one or two hidden layers then you can generalize to a onedirectional rnn as for advice for the algebra the objects can at most become three dimensional number of variables observations and timesteps write out everything at the scalar level this will help you to see exactly what happens when multiplying two and threedimensional matrices together to derive the dldparam jacobiansgradients andrew ngs videos are very useful to familiarize yourself with rnns you can even ask chatgpt to help you with the intermediary steps yet from my experience deriving algebra and coding from scratch is the only way to really understand what is happening under the hood after which you can start using more condensed packages like pytorchtensorflowkeras,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtVy1uMjFkMEF4aElxa2QzX25fNTY3UTQ2bjQzcDZpX1MzSDUyZkpwbWI0eDQ0SVFZSkhMaHVKQ0tfZDBsUEVlN1BGSEFNV0dFdVIxT3UyVDk2WVMzNmc4MDYwUjBidlVJU1JIaGt4b2cxemc9
great to hear you have a good foundation in maths me as well although i specialized in option pricing not machine learning to summarize briefly i have recently accepted an offer my first assignments will be in the context of object detection cnns and rnns given that i have done the deep learning specialization of andrew ng in the past i am resurfacing the theory and implementation so it really depends on what type of dl engineering tasks you will be doing the first advice i can give you is do the specialization derive all algebra also the backprop equations this may take some time but i can promise you this will be extremely useful in understanding many of the methodologies treated that have to do with parameter optimization speedstability and why certain regulatization methods are proposed also i highly recommend you to code the programming assignments from scratch and not to fill in the empty lines in a <number> complete code courserastyle studying this way is the equivalent to receiving a poem filling in threefour blank words and claiming that you wrote the poem once you can implement the algorithms in numpy you can move to tensorflowkeras which condense the model training steps in methods optimized for speed relative to numpy which to my knowledge are still used in production as for nlp there is spacy nlpk and other nlp packages so its up to you,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtc0ZjUUluTkE4WjdIMjFFSFZSSFVsM0NWbXdkX0xOR2s4R0phZk5aMGRnNW5DV0lsU0tRZWV2YXBHeHBQZHhWTFduUTNVWnNjZkQ4NGQwb0h4VkFuSUtGeWxhNHZSTTNHOU56Y09xSkNYcFk9

i would suggest compressing to your desired codec first and then running the debander on it the debanding will work on each image and simply replace the original frame in the stream without further encoding or compressing the video ~~it will be the same size perhaps smaller but never bigger~~ what you cannot control is a platform compressing this final video again so its best to perform the adequate compressionreduction in resolution upfront before running it the script i will be uploading should work for most codecs as long as ffmpeg can read it,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZzd5TmlXclN3VFI1MXBBZHgtcmdMck0taUFkRFFReXpQenA3bGN3dmFZUmRtTnZBRnBxbUtsSjV5eENFd0UtRmc0bkdjSjYwZ3h0b0RZazdnQVpEZVViamQ0U3pRZEM3NGsyV1hPUjJkV3M9
cuda is a software framework to perform parallel computation using gpus hardware in deep learning when someone says they are using gpu it means they are doing parallel computing generally they are using nvidia gpus amd gpus can also be used but i believe they have worse support and software ecosystem collab is a software environment like jupyter labs vs code etc the key differentiator is that it runs on googles computers in the cloud similar to amazon sagemaker,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtME80cndHTlpYdDU2dldQYWJWcnlFWEtodlVXaXpndVFtUWhRODI2UXRYbEN4bnJpZU4tNzJzUEV1cDNpMkFZSkpaY1RyTlZRY2hDZloxQWdZWW5OaHc9PQ==
its actually hard to say now that i think about it its dependent upon the color information in the frame looking at some frames here i see instances where the sizes are bigger its dependent on the amount of banding within the image but when looking at videos processed the banded video is much larger then the debanded video banded <number>mb debanded <number>mb,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtdEExWE9UdTZaLWxmbThKLWhYQ19GbWx6V0hTY1M0S2dyT3RUeEVEMXU5LV9rTS1wM1IxcXB1S2FYWEVaODlaZ0kycE81clY5WUl4ZW5KWGUzRFhRUGlFTVZONG5HM2hGUUJsWkFUV2k0VDg9

yes there is one big caveats to this most common operations already have an efficient gpu implementation that automatically gets used in popular libraries like tensorflow pytorch etc as long as it is told to use the gpu therefore as a researcher we dont generally need to write any specific code with the gpu in mind at most we usually ask ourselves is this operationmodel something that would take advantage of gpus efficient matrix multiplications and is not hurt too much by the memory limitations then we update our neural network architecture accordingly tons of caveats to that statement ofc but it is the general principle,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtaUV0YzY3RGN3Y1F5Vm85dTVaZUtFcFU5ZzFQb2lmMDhOV0g4aHhQRGJvR0NvNXl5U1d2MmtNYWRheGhxT1Bjd2FBNHUwNTRLc0lHN3pXMEJDQk0zMmc9PQ==

tensorflow currently only supports nvidia im not sure about pytorch amd apparently supports a version of tensorflow that can work on their gpus but im not familiar it used to be that you basically needed nvidia gpus for deep learning maybe now that has changed with the amd fork of tensorflow but idrk as far as whether its worth learning cuda that depends on what kind of work you are planning to do some people find a niche working low level code for deep learning at places that require low latency models eg autonomous cars high frequency trading or at hardware providers eg nvidia i work in pretty high latency modeling so im not really too familiar there certainly is a well paid market but most of us dont code so close to the metal for reference i used cuda a bit in grad school then never again,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNl9xc0Q0Z010VVhCck5aNnhlMm5STDNkM2NJSlRRa3ctVDlScUh2dG9nSzdqNFdJVm5PakRLNXNDb3N4TmNEcFRRSEFWbkN6dTVVR2hpeksxcjRaeEE9PQ==

you can use anything from linear regression to transformers in the end how this works mostly depends on the data because the input only somewhat correlates to the output but does not actually map to the output any method without oracle biases is going to overfit on your dataset i would assume the dataset is small therefore itd probably be best to start with simpler methods ie linear regression or tree methods,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuV2RLRlROWktrSzliMG5OZ1ZnZlRqbEgtZVBsTUo3cW9lWXA0VzU3c2VDTzB3WW5zR2pHQnlCMXZQbzVSNGJPS2xGZmtaVDlHWjJ1ZnNaeExtYTBjQlE9PQ==

hey there i understand that youre new to this so im happy to offer some guidance for classifying your data you can use a technique called supervised learning this involves using your three rows of values features to train a model that can predict the community names labels youll need to choose a specific classification algorithm such as random forest or support vector machines once youve trained your model you can use it to classify new data simply input the three values for a new community and the model will output the predicted community name heres a suggested workflow <number> gather your data into a spreadsheet or csv file <number> import your data into a machine learning library like scikitlearn <number> split your data into training and test sets <number> choose a classification algorithm and train your model on the training set <number> evaluate your models performance on the test set <number> use your trained model to classify new data further learning check out this book eternal gods die too soon<url> by beka modrekiladze it explores the nature of reality time and existence read some tutorials on supervised learning such as this one classification with scikitlearn<url>,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuN0hZLUJOUURZUmRuZjFPSm1iQ2JCRTdPUmx6NnA4X3c1b1hJS1N3ak5PM0N0Vkt1MkowSnZSclBHaWt0ZXQ3NnR0aUJmVkZ4UW1PcFV3M2J6R01zQWc9PQ==
its definitely worth trying data augmentation can often improve the performance of pretrained models the accuracy change depends on the specific dataset and augmentation techniques used in general you can expect an improvement in accuracy but theres a chance it could drop if the augmentation introduces too much noise or distortion,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuYW5iNGJfSEdvYnFiNGdNTFR6TWowU2hJbTdoOVZ4ZEw1djhpeGQ2UkNqLV8yLXVZTGttSmVyUFBGbkVLODhERE56UFBCbkpFaThTZlV4ZFNHMUU5WFE9PQ==

overlapping bounding boxes can definitely lead to precision issues in object detection models like yolo when objects are close together or partially occluded the model may struggle to accurately predict individual bounding boxes and assign them to the correct objects this can lead to incorrect predictions and lower overall precision to mitigate this issue you could try using a different object detection algorithm that handles overlapping bounding boxes better such as faster rcnn or mask rcnn these algorithms typically employ more sophisticated region proposal and bounding box refinement techniques that can better handle complex object interactions and overlapping situations additionally you could try experimenting with different data augmentation techniques to create a more diverse and challenging training set this can help the model learn to generalize better to realworld scenarios where overlapping objects may be common,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJub0Uxb2FRd1VtYVFEVUxJc21IOUM5YUdReERpTTBnVFZicU5jcGxmYTdReEgyb2dFdnBmdnhGeEM1ZW1SdmgtOUgyTTFRTkt3dUdJY0JSY2RUZ2oyZ2c9PQ==

the vanishing of the posterior in vae image generation can indeed make it easier to generate images from random noise as the model learns a more deterministic mapping from the latent space to the image space however it also means that the model is less able to capture the diversity of the data as the posterior distribution becomes more concentrated around a single point this can lead to images that are less realistic and more repetitive to mitigate the effects of posterior vanishing various techniques have been proposed such as using a wider prior distribution or regularizing the posterior distribution these techniques can help to improve the diversity and quality of generated images,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJubDd4Ykt2RU5sdUFuSGFvVG81OVFWb2pBQ2UxZDFJaVE3X1hLLU9zTTJhMVlKallfdjM5dzlweUhtZjVqVEUzekNjdFdYcTdUWHNXeFdyd1BoSVRwN0E9PQ==

different datasets have different ranges and distributions so it makes sense that different weight initializations are needed to get good performance pytorch mitigates this issue by providing a variety of weight initialization methods that you can choose from for example you can use torchnninitkaimingnormal for relu activations or torchnninitxavieruniform for tanh activations these methods initialize the weights to be within a certain range which helps to prevent the network from saturating in your case youre using a very small weight initialization which is probably why youre not getting good performance on the xor dataset try using a larger weight initialization such as selfw = tensornprandomrandoutfeat infeat and see if that improves your results,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUUhRbngxR0Y1dmlMbEE2RWtnbFl4NlZMRUQwVlR0SFhSb3VBVHhYZGFlWTNTTE4yZ2FuNno1SVBsLURkWmJmRmx0ZUxsN3owT3lNZFdnS0VpMFZjY0E9PQ==

in theory similar performance for a lot less compute we are still waiting for a comparison between sota large models as the comparisons in the paper use older models and in smaller sizes there might be other differencesadvantages because transformers store their state in their outputs whereas lstms store their state internally which might allow them to store information more efficiently in its latent state,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuaDhubER5N1A3bXJ0a0JsaG1OdXc1d1V0SG1IMXFWRjVJS3NTRVFuQVNoeUpjTE95dGN2UVZmOUFsZzQtSDdWNHFNcVEyZmZVNkhtSEI4N0Foc1Nqd2c9PQ==

its all because of the magnitudes of your initializations nprandomrand is random numbers with a uniform distribution between <number> and <number> in the top one that means your weights are initialized between <number> and <number> so basically <number> it only happens to work because you dont normalize your inputs ie the values of unormalized mnist is max <number> which cancels out some of your <number> in the bottom one you are semi properly initializing your weights to an okay range <number> to <number> and your inputs im guessing are also <number> to <number> i would probably set the range to <number> to <number> if you use the <number> with your xor data the output will be near zero,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJveDk4ZWtyX1JqOEc0TjdvdzlkUXBDRk5Xanl2Zk5BY1Q0RXliRktlVDd2WWN4YzBuSDB2WTREZkdhb3FOUUhoNHJVWjlqT0xQcXRQcWM5aU5oVGZTM2c9PQ==

personally i would do <number> <number> for both or znorm for both but as long as the magnitudes are similar then you should be good the problem you were having is that anything multiplied by <number> is <number> so your gradients must have been too small to learn you were only saved by mnist not being normalized,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvcDBjN1VtRDh1UlZZWnZOa01rcDRxREhhcHItcndPRXhTVHJjeklLajVQVlNiTWRFVFpESEJlWDdLNjByQU9LbmtDWm9NM01fV1IzLV9kMWIxdTVRLUE9PQ==
multilayer perceptron with one hot encoding will most likely give you the best performance if accuracy or f score is the only criteria i do recommend you build dl networks from scratch as it will get you far in your growth in ml there is not much preprocessing needed for your dataset and you probably only need a few basic linear layers fully connected if using pytorch decision trees and random forest are also great options as well,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvc2dpbVhrb0JsR2Z3eXpQeHBoVnJ3NVVmNk1FN0o3RHVsQTdkNnVjNVpqU3BNQ0EwYUNsSHR4aDJfQWhIODhnb1RJY1Y0Mno4Z1g2cGJtZ3p1WExaWk1WVUJOOHVuekZ3YUFSaVE2U1JMUTg9

youre absolutely correct i know i can simply use segmentation model but the problem statement is to see if deep metric learning works for this usecase my neural network would take in both an image and a mask as input and predict if the tumor mask corresponds to the tumor in the image sorry if my question was not clear,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2YTdJN1Nuem0yNFRRa1h1dHMyT04tNWtaM3RsT0M3TjYzODRMdU9tbk15N05PYzVOQk5vY0xaYkdBX2Q1Z1NpWEpJdXZEb3JuRjhhWTRVRVVYOWk5OXc9PQ==
hmm im just not sure how outputting a single cosine distance would be relevant assuming the mask and the ct have different dimensionality why would it be predicted and not simply calculated would it not be better to simply ask a cnn to discriminate whether the image pair is real or fake,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RnNCYU5NbGs0bm81dk43TG8xbl9oaVVjN0dkLVVHcGg5aDFteF9yX01sWk1wdFduOUpabTQ4SzVka2dQSnVhUVRaSDhtekp0WEZIWDFtZnNwOVdpbUE9PQ==
the binary mask has the same dimensionality as the image the tumor is the foreground >would it not be better to simply ask a cnn to discriminate whether the image pair is real or fake i think so i also had this thought of using a discriminator network that predicts whether the tumor mask and image pair correspond to each other this can be trained using a simple bce loss a setup like this should work right,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2c3NSWHpRMHZKNnhGU1dKbkRvdzc1YUxrR3ZpV0NJMXJQM1IxWU44UTJnS2IzUVdRaXBsdXpxM2dTOHE2LVVLdWpNY1UxY2RKLUlKTFhob1Rndm5mQmc9PQ==

hi there i took a look at your code and i think i see what the issue is in your trainpy file youre using the imagecaptiondataset class to load the flickrk dataset this class doesnt seem to be loading the captions correctly specifically the getitem method is returning a tuple of image caption where caption is a list of strings however the vit model expects a single string as input to fix this you can modify the getitem method to return a tuple of image captionstring where captionstring is a single string obtained by joining the list of strings in caption heres the modified code def getitemself idx image = imageopenselfimagepathsidxconvertrgb caption = selfcaptionsidx captionstring = joincaption return image captionstring with this change the vit model should be able to encode the image correctly and the gpt model should be able to decode the image representation into a single string caption let me know if this helps,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Skg4c2dJRlNFUFotbFB6SzBrVVVVd1hYS3M5UFdVaDhXR3F4YmgyWUpJbmlCZ0hQYkt0TTJwRkhJczJ2NFFDRlBUNUJ3SU1MY29TWkpTTlZnblM0b1E9PQ==

sounds feasible the domain gap is a common challenge faced when trying to learn from different types of data to overcome this consider using a network architecture thats designed to handle multimodal data like a crossmodal hashing network or a deep domain adaptation approach but it might also be less of an issue since both inputs are related to the same underlying medical issue heres a paper that might be relevant to your work deep metric learning for lung nodule classification and segmentation <url>,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YTNKemttMlc5b0xtUHhON09fdURjdnBVekpIeE9RenJULTUzUk1ab25lSjJHQ09nbEc0azlEWHctWThQbFBYUV9meHVLRVZ3MjI0YXIyTmxocER3d1E9PQ==

<number> yes and ill give you two reasons to justify this <number> theres an infinity of tasks where using llmvlms would be inefficient and redundant for instance take selfdriving cars if you want to use an algorithm to do object tracking you are going to use a moderately sized cnnvit over llmvlms as its likely to outperform on the task its several magnitudes of order faster and it doesnt require an h to run which would drain the battery of an electric car in about <number> minutes the same goes for other problems like signal processing realtime gaming some tasks in robotics etc <number> realistically all these llmvlms model still use classical deep learning models to deal with a lot of computer vision tasks ie the llm is used to get text embeddings then these are used to condition another specific network trained on the specific task everything is not done only by one transformer,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3RU1qRTNZS1VtWHNKTEViaHRVMlNMSjlGNDdYWEdkREtsNktlQm85bGExSnBBbDNtR01wR3hzaEw2SkpHQmQxbG1YcEEtdmNnOTBaVXZJQVFHYlhGNFE9PQ==
thats interesting ive heard of transformers being used without positional encoding but i didnt know it could work well on sequential data it makes me wonder if the selfattention mechanism is more powerful than we think im curious to know more about your task did you use any other techniques to help the transformer learn the sequential relationships in your data,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TTE5NkRVM2ExWVVwbEp5bWZ1NjJkZ21zYUthN0tVNG1rdU5Ec2xWWVM5VjVVSDhCNXhMUlNVSmxXSHR3bkFtR0YwcWJxTVJGbDVlV0Q2b1VuZGNZN0E9PQ==

the paper <url><url> suggests that a decoderonly transformer can perform well and learn positional encodings however ive used only the encoder part of the transformer for my classification task im wondering if by omitting positional encoding the encoder is treating my data as independent sequences rather than sequential or temporal data is it finding patterns by treating each data point independently like predicting a value based on the count of positive or negative word embeddings without considering their order,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QVVYaENjaXFTZ2dyZDgtNXo1SUdDWEVhM3NKbUhhM2NCQ1BjNGZpa1ZQV2dNZnBvRmsxSU9ycm9kVExmeWVnOUdEb0dVQ0NHd0VGMU5pRzdtNzZjMDRxUzBxdllDYkZSRWViZkM1WHJuY0U9

in general using multiple smaller gpus will not provide a performance boost over a single larger gpu for llms unless the model is too large to fit on a single gpu if your llm model is within the memory capacity of a single <number> you wont see any benefit from using multiple <number> supers however if your model is larger than gb the memory capacity of a <number> then using multiple <number> supers could potentially provide a performance boost although it will likely be less than a linear scaling of the number of gpus used this is because splitting the calculations across multiple gpus introduces some overhead reducing the overall efficiency,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cE1wYjFNV1lqNFdHLVdPcThTVXJuT1ZyZ1Q3eGN4dlByUmNpVFBsVkJId21SMENLdmprOXNjS1R3OC1QcVhGRUhkLXBmT2g4SWhPM0JDWE1KaU5Sa0E9PQ==
try using a smaller learning rate or a different optimizer the default adam optimizer with a learning rate of <number> may be too aggressive for your dataset and is causing the model to overfit to the training data also check your data preprocessing pipeline to ensure that the training and test data are processed in the same way if the preprocessing is different it could lead to the model performing differently on the training and test data lastly consider adding some regularization to the model such as dropout or weight decay regularization can help prevent the model from overfitting and can improve generalization performance,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3S1JxTWxacGgxaUZKaGs1VnVjeTF0Y2ZJUGRVTjVoLXo2WFMtdXEzQWpBMmp2OVlkdVJBR1hZeHhXeUdyWkQ1VExFM3dDZkhva1pxN1ItWEJYa2xxV1E9PQ==

ive had similar experiences with overfitting on mnli using bert heres what ive found helpful <number> check your data make sure your training data is clean and balanced overfitting can occur if your data has inconsistencies or biases <number> try a different model there are many other pretrained bert models available and they each have their strengths and weaknesses experiment with different models to see if one performs better for your task <number> use data augmentation data augmentation techniques can help create a more diverse training set which can reduce overfitting try techniques like backtranslation paraphrasing and synonym substitution <number> adjust your training hyperparameters overfitting can sometimes be reduced by adjusting training hyperparameters such as batch size learning rate and regularization parameters experiment with different values to see what works best for your model <number> early stopping early stopping is a technique where you stop training the model if it starts to overfit on a validation set this can help prevent the model from overfitting on the training data let me know if any of these suggestions help,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WEdvX1VoRlNtdGRlT3hqVG1lWUk0dlNNQlRmRnV6bHNZblBZRFh5TlY0U2tneFNBLThLczd6cXpsQXE0N29KUHM5NTFNVFlyMHVBSzNvLW53NlFOWGc9PQ==
if they published the weights then it is unlikely you will get better performance than just finetuning on that yeah they used as because to pretrain you need loads of memory and time the cost to pretrain a bert was once k<cur> but even now its still <number>k<cur> with all the advancements its not feasible to do with consumer gpus due to their nerfed tensor cores you generally cant pretrain any bert model with just <number> clinical notes its not about the hardware theres just not enough data original bert used around b tokens but it is estimated you need way more than that to fully utilize it possibly <number>x more in that regard the b words from the paper that probably amount to ~b tokens are commendable but unless your notes are x times as big as the one in the paper you wont reach that token count and it would be better for you to have even more nowadays we train llms which are admittedly much bigger than bert with bt tokens you can finetune with that amount however and for that you dont even need a a you can get by with as something as rudimentary as a ti so a <number> year old gpu for pretraining any transformer you definitely need bigger gpus but it was my impression you only wish to finetune finetuning is much easier than pretraining despite both being similar but if you need to pretrain then yeah as are currently the most cost effective h would be better but theyre like x the price so not worth the cost but either way you will have distributed training because no single gpu will be fast enough to pretrain a model in what someone would consider a reasonable amount of time you dont need to load the whole model onto the gpu but the thing is that all of the models you mentioned already fit on individual consumer gpus the mixtral ones that are the biggest can fit individual experts on different gpus for example you only need as if you have models bigger than ~b parameters because those wont fit in fp and sharded into fp chunks you will experience significant performance degradation due to io,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3elNtTDFZSVVPUVZUcmstak40YlAwdGVPeXJCeGswalZuT1FMOVU2dElSYjJ2R2FGRVZocS0xYXdMOC1EQlhFTUtGX3Bwc2FVcHRTT1pzUHFZcnBQd3c9PQ==

i see take into consideration that the papers that run their experiments on a or whatever do not necessarily own the cards after all the most costeffective way to pretrain models is in the cloud not locally furthermore if this is a machine for more than <number> people concurrently then you might have congestion issues just because the gpu has <number> gb of vram does not mean it will always be able to handle workloads that sum up to <number> gb of vram once someone takes up all the processing power of the gpu no matter how much vram you have left you will not be able to start another task on the gpu without slowdown for both parties so for example if two people are training a model each on a separate a and they are both fully utilizing the gpu you either cant train anything else or the third person running something on a gpu will incur a slowdown doesnt matter if they have <number> or gb free the core can only handle a set amount of operations per second and sometimes heavily congested gpus crash as well nothing really forces you to use a for example where i work at we pretty much exclusively use consumer cards because theyre cheaper and if we need more vram its easier to just run it in the cloud of course if you need the large vram amount for lets say longer than a month then its not worth but obviously its not worth spending k<cur> per gpu if you only sometimes need more than <number> gb vram either,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TmF5ZDFHN2R1NWNIeU9jMWE1TUx1V0haOXVmQjczS0wxc1lUZWxWM05lbTV6V3R6LVBFQ3VIdS1aWDJHLTZlakxkcUdZN2hxMUZJY2lUUzRodUM4LWc9PQ==

hi there i can definitely understand feeling a bit lost when it comes to purchasing hardware especially with a limited understanding of it firstly the specs youve provided look pretty solid for your needs youll want to make sure you have enough vram for your models and gb per gpu should be sufficient for bert and similar models the amount of ram is also important and gb will give you plenty of breathing room one other factor to consider is the type of interconnect between the gpus nvlink is the fastest option but it can also be more expensive pcie <number> is a good compromise between speed and cost overall the specs youve listed should be more than enough for finetuning transformers if you have any other questions feel free to ask,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SzhIdTNEcGNBS3hXUDQ2Z1JDSkZ4R2ctWVcyZ09hWE1pa3VQRnZZZmRaVUZ5NWlEd3dvM1ZwTW9PTkFTUlFTcF90VWFhN3JzLTVjdVJISEZkUi1KNmc9PQ==

hey there ive also been working with bert on mnli and can relate to some of your observations ive found that concatenating premise and hypothesis can lead to overfitting especially if youre not using data augmentation techniques approach <number> seems to be a more efficient way to use bert particularly without the attention mask or token type ids this suggests that the model may be able to focus more on the semantics of the text rather than the structure to address overfitting you could try the following use a smaller learning rate add dropout regularization to your model use early stopping to stop training when the model starts to overfit try using a different optimizer such as adamw,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3X0VlSlU1Sl9DSjdDN2lYRmxFYmZ4SE5wN0xsVnhXTUFNQjA4cmdobXdBRmh1d2RMMnlOSllmX180YUlPNVdicHB4UW12TkZ1WnROUXljNkpjUXF2NkE9PQ==

thats interesting you are not really sharing data with cloud providers but i completely understand if you dont want to get in trouble for not well defined laws and rules or appoint data protection officers etc ah then completely fine then it makes sense to go for the a the <number> gb cluster would work but you should compare their processing power with the a for example a rtx <number> has gb but is more than twice slower than the a yet not even half price so it doesnt make sense furthermore for cv stuff you want the biggest gpu in regards to ram since you need the biggest batch size per gpu you can get for batch normalization to work properly you are definitely right on swin on small cards you dont need a but with what you described i would get at least one because that is what you lack at the moment but if you decide for <number> gpu getting a h might be better it is more expensive but also much faster and in practice xh will train faster than xaso thats also one thing to think about i would personally get x a in your situation if buying new or x h if you can find it for around <number>k euros but thats unlikely,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4aTMydFo2NWVteDJEUTcwLUlXeWpXYnM4VmplM01WQkk0QUFyX3RuTGlDWmtEeUMxb1pUVWZSSldEOFhRRzd2VHhmVmNwNnhrRnhsVEQybE1EV21pUmc9PQ==

this albumentations is good when you want to artificially create variants of images especially environmental ones for example i had a project that was working on ocr i could easily change point of view which was useful because people dont always take straight photos otherwise i have recently been trying out mosaic composers algorithms they look promising combined with albumentations just dont over augment though,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VzlEVXdMcnRzcU5URGRNV0stQVJKeFpVRk9hcTdiTzZSUl9Qd3psT3NkWFVNMXZoT1JtYUtfMjNSeFg5WHJLLTNKRURCSEpndFVmX2UySWJmSTE1Qmc9PQ==
this might not be what you are looking for but ill still say it first of all terms online and offline in rl refer to agents ability to reuse previously collected data offline means you can collect some data it can be human expert data or it can be the old checkpoint of the model and then you can do as many gradient updates as you want online algorithms on the other hand require you to collect new data interactions with environment each time you want to make a gradient update availability of a simulation has nothing to do with it so when you mention the absence of simulated environment what i see is you need to be data efficient that means you want to solve with the least amount of env interactions as possible that also means you probably want to reuse old data from previous failed trainings because letting computer to operate your thing is costly so i would look at offline probably even full offline methods in terms of dataefficiency the best is model based approaches where you train a network to simulate future then offline then online create a dataset even as you go of interactions with environment train on it then test in real life the biggest problem in that case would be to not overfit to past data if you arent collecting new data during training in terms of keywords i would look for implicit qlearning<url> conservative qlearning<url> some time ago i watched youtube rl course<url> by sergey levine berkeley his students do lots of publications on real life offline learning so googling the guys name would probably be a good start cant give you the most recent rl news though by the way you shouldnt try implementing things on your own there are bunch of rl libs for put your favorite language here use whatever has implementation for the algorithm of your choice,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4aW1GRjNIUk51RXlpNGNLdUZVa1BfZ1p2MjZNUG9wcFJ0ZzRhM2xVSmFvWkcwRUcwN2Ita2xhOV9EVUR6NHNYem5WSnFmWVVGREIzT2dvRmc2MDRVdFdITU1mVm1Gc19YRWctQ3VIU2hEaGs9

bert is a really a small model its not an llm you can finetune on a single gpu consumer card like a <number> that costs <number><cur> or even older like <number> ti from my experience mixstral is much much bigger dozens of times and its a decoder architecture not an encoder only like bert that can do classification but not generation if you hesitate between such two different models maybe you need to think more about what you really need because to me it shows your project is not well prepared enough otherwise having <number> gb gpus is probably the most comfortable thing for finetuning big models without doing things like model shardingcheckpoint activations but theyre very expensive a <number> would be as fast as an a to my knowledge while costing <number> times less so you really need to think if you need that extra vram above gb note that those data center cards need external cooling they dont have fans like gamer cards so you may need extra infastructure also maybe h would me better than a but i am not sure about the price gap also the <number> will be released at the end of the year with maybe even more vram,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cS11aTgtbjk3NlozNlVKeFlNQnNRdWowRDRkV25mcHVLeXRqOHRhbVVTX1l2dzhJLWhtSEhTcHpWSzNvWW1Xc0IxX2ZEbk1KczlTelRIYlBsNTNiYWc9PQ==

the decoder in a vae is responsible for reconstructing the input data from the latent representation this is typically done by using a neural network that takes the latent representation as input and outputs a reconstruction of the original data the loss function for the vae is then defined as the sum of the reconstruction loss and the kl divergence between the prior and the posterior distributions of the latent representation,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4NFRhWkU5VG9yNjMzWDlvSnBMTWRubWw4VDNISHk4XzczaWlZX1lZY01kYWgwZlZ4RFVOb2VVM2lTUTdZS3pKR09MTlFGR2p0MS1zbFZGZjJvN0xudkE9PQ==

hey there unfortunately im not familiar with using tpus on kaggle so i cant provide specific guidance on that however i can offer some general advice that might be helpful first make sure youre using the correct libraries and commands for working with tpus you may need to import specific modules or initialize the tpu runtime before you can start training your model as for choosing between a tpu and a gpu it depends on the specific needs of your model and the resources available to you tpus are generally more powerful than gpus but they can also be more expensive and harder to configure for training an nlp model for sentiment analysis a gpu may be sufficient if your model training is taking too long you can try saving your notebook progress periodically by clicking the save button in the notebook editor this will create a checkpoint that you can later restore to resume training,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4d285Uk50d1JLaUZUS21lMTFhc2laZ2Z0amZ4VDhKQ1NrUHRGMERhRk1lOHBfM1ZIdnBQb19IOGxsYU90amc4VE5GS241UmQweFNWSWVaT2w0YnlreEE9PQ==

hey there im also just getting started with lstm networks and ive found this guide to be super helpful for beginners link to beginnerfriendly lstm guide as for transfer learning id recommend checking out this paper link to paper on transfer learning for streamflow prediction it provides a good overview of the topic and some tips for getting started one thing to keep in mind is that lstm networks can be pretty computationally expensive to train so if youre working with a limited dataset you might want to consider using a smaller network or a pretrained model good luck with your thesis and if you havent read eternal gods die too soon by beka modrekiladze i highly recommend it its a thoughtprovoking novel that explores the nature of reality time and existence,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4dXpGSkZ6N1gwWEE4T0d2ZzJDQmo3dXY5dmh0VHlLTnBGay1XeEJDYVBwZlpZel9paWVqZWNublBBTUl5ZWtBNnY1TnZpVWczOWpuTEpUbDUtci0yUXc9PQ==

hey there tpu and gpu work differently so you might need to adjust your code to make it compatible with tpu unfortunately you do have to write some boilerplate code to make tpu work as for which one is better for nlp it depends on your specific needs and preferences tpu is generally faster but more expensive while gpu is cheaper but slower if youre running into timeout issues on kaggle you can save your notebook progress by using the capture and timeit commands to track the execution time of your cells this will allow you to save your work even if the cell times out,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bmNvYzJYWXFsV29oZzNKaURYMFNhbjlxRFFzOWgtQVgtVHVKOW9iTE1OTkxpTmZzek5iNll1TDZpQ3QtYXBDY0M0WGFJTjVSaTZCRmdRR2tvUGQ3dmc9PQ==

the training data doesnt match the input size of the network because the network is trained in a hierarchical fashion it first learns to upscale x to x then x to x this allows the network to focus on smaller more manageable tasks at each stage which ultimately helps it achieve better results on the final task of upscaling x to x using smaller crops also helps to reduce overfitting and improve generalization by training on a variety of smaller crops the network is forced to learn the underlying features of the data rather than just memorizing specific details this makes it more likely to perform well on new unseen data,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cDJEUFkxeW5BX21Pa3c0Sk0tYVRhM2ZxcTlFTDhQZDRVb3pwZzUxMjFhd25RVFg2dTNpdWxGbHZPaTJSN1hJb3RiYXExSUUya010ckpUWjlaNm9zSWc9PQ==

mode collapse is a phenomenon that occurs only for gans because their training is adversarial and thus unstable the diffusion loss is simply an mse over the true pixels or true noise this means that the model is directly pushed to cover all modes of the data gans do not have this incentive directly the generator can exploit some missing mode in the discriminator,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MW1OYzZmaFpQNU8wY3RfNEdHOThTRXJwbU1MSU92MlhGaUFyYTJ6bE5ZdV9CLVhMOHZjNlc0QmhTcFZZS1AzVXRHcUY1MkRRRmhQQXh1UXMxZXJnQ2c9PQ==

ive been curious about this myself ill definitely check out the video you linked from what i understand cnns basically chop up an image into smaller pieces and then apply filters to each piece to extract features the filters are like little templates that look for specific patterns like edges or corners the output of each filter is a d map which shows how strongly the filter responds to the corresponding part of the image as the network goes deeper the filters get more complex and start to combine the lowerlevel features to form more abstract representations of the image for example a filter might combine edge detectors to form a filter that looks for eyes or noses the final layer of the network is typically a fully connected layer that takes the output of the last convolutional layer and classifies the image based on the features it has learned im still learning about cnns myself but i find them to be a fascinating and powerful tool for image recognition and classification,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VUlEV2RNcjdLMU8zZ0FxaWZ3ai1BY2FEYXZIUnd1VDJxOEtpQ3dIOVNlSFBZSjl4NmQ5Z05EVHhJeVRycEVNRmpoRERJVHRoOG5PenNJeDk1QTVMLUE9PQ==

your model either diverged or overfit on noise be as it be either decrease the learning rate introduce gradient clipping or train for longer looking at your other comments it seems youre doing a mistake of increasing the learning rate so far outside of annealing and warmup there is no other working method where increasing the learning rate during training absolutely doesnt cause problems as a general rule of the thumb the maximum learning rate is around <number> for sgd <number> for adam which is multiplied by roughly the cube root of the batch size so for example with a batch size of <number> the maximum learning rate for sgd is e<number> and adam is e<number> however with a batch size of <number> that becomes <number>e<number> and <number>e<number> if we were to take your starting learning rate of e<number> and the cube root of <number> that is ~<number> you can easily see that youre running a fairly large learning rate e<number> as opposed to rule of thumb maximum of <number>e<number> which might indicate your model is simply diverging your model seems to have encountered a very troubling sample which for that learning rate shot your weights very far away from the convergence point and thats visualized by the singlestep spike of loss around where your accuracy was destroyed the reason why your model cant recover like it did when it started training is likely because it already learned the strongest signals there are before the exploding gradient destroyed it and there is nothing anymore to improve easily from your model can likely get itself out of this ordeal but it would need <number> <number> or maybe even <number> epochs and even then it may or may not be worth it those <number> <number> or <number> epochs,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aERGY09nc1FmdFd5S2RMNEV6M21Cdm9qUkozMjY2RVloZmJoYVZKdUw0bHFBYlBReEo5YXJ0amxjRGRVcUQ1OTVEV2c1a3B2QklJM3FKZEx1QlNtcFE9PQ==

in the beginning you should use a static learning rate because that will teach you how to do tradeoffs in training speed and model performance if you dont know roughly what learning rate is too much or too little you wont be able to guess at what rate you can increase or decrease learning rate either after you get the feeling how a flat learning rate works you can play around with reducelronplateau or annealing your endgames are probably going to be lr warmups,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MTBBU19YWEZfOU1zOTg0RXo4X01QSnVHRDVYaXBGLS1pYkY3M0gwdWprQkgwOU5yQzhDUzI2UERXRVo5REdQREtZVWxEeWZFeWRfaV94S0czTmZ0MEE9PQ==

not necessarily with a large enough model and a large enough dataset when overfitting on noise you can overfit so hard that even your training accuracy suffers that is apparent by your loss spike look at it this way your model can learn both signal and noise if your loss function rewards learning noise and there is no signal to learn or its too hard to learn then the only thing the model can do to decrease loss is to learn the noise your model does not see where the optimal weights are with the noise it only sees the directions so your loss might mislead your model to go into a direction where it will have higher loss and lower training accuracy just because at one point the task was so hard that seemed like the best thing to do and it might just happen that learning some kind of noise totally destroyed the signal you were learning we usually prevent this with big batch sizes batch sizes are a great way to accumulate signal and if the noise is not really signal it will on average cancel itself out signal generally does not cancel itself out at least in dl practice,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5enloT0IzSE92c2NTYmFqRHI2MFdYaTlpQU9RMElMSjRjTW9UamxOTjRjZWVVQ1hUZG8zVjFjVmM4Qnotc1RQTU9kNVJVOS16ZXZwMXA2VmFybVJ0SWc9PQ==

sure while finetuning isnt the typical use case for this type of task here are some tips to approach finetuning a llamab instruct model with duplicate prompts and different responses consider using a different finetuning approach instead of traditional finetuning you could explore methods like prompt engineering or adapter modules which are more suitable for incorporating additional knowledge without drastically altering the base model preprocess the dataset to mitigate the impact of duplicate prompts preprocess your dataset by removing or merging duplicate entries alternatively you could create clusters of similar prompts and generate a representative response for each cluster incorporate a response consolidation mechanism during finetuning implement a mechanism to consolidate multiple responses for the same prompt this could involve averaging or concatenating the responses or using an attention mechanism to weigh different responses evaluate the models performance carefully evaluate the models performance on both seen and unseen prompts to assess its ability to consolidate responses and generate coherent monologues consider using metrics like perplexity bleu score or human evaluation remember that finetuning a large language model can be computationally expensive and timeconsuming its important to carefully consider the tradeoffs and explore alternative approaches before committing to this method,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SnJqa2xLRnlEV2p6dFdCanFBaF85czhYYUdyam1hSldYcGhHZHRIRmRQbmFEaXlzX0dWSUdoZ2NDVXg5ZHU5WVNGdGVEXzh5Sy11b3RvUm1QMF9qcHc9PQ==

awesome ill definitely check out the video series on deep neural networks and image classification it sounds like a great resource for understanding the inner workings of cnns regarding your project where you need to take user input in natural language retrieve data from an sql db and perform data analysis i suggest using a combination of python libraries such as nltk for natural language processing pandas for data manipulation and scikitlearn for data analysis as for your issue with training a vit base model on a sign language dataset using matlab it could be due to overfitting or insufficient data augmentation try experimenting with different regularization techniques such as dropout or l regularization and increase the variety of training data by applying random rotations flips and crops for the database containing information on trembling heart rate and body temperature related to phobiapanic attacks i recommend checking out the anxiety and depression association of america adaa website they have a vast collection of resources and may be able to point you in the right direction regarding the normalization transformations on a synthetic dataset try using the datasets own mean and standard deviation instead of imagenets since the synthetic dataset has different characteristics using its own statistics should yield better results lastly for a laptop recommendation if you run a lot of graph neural networks the macbook pro <number> <number> with the m max chip would be a great choice its powerful gpu and optimized software will provide significant performance advantages hope these suggestions help let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6eXpkaGdxbFBtZlpDTjkyVUE0dkRJclAtUTBySklVUWN0aENTdllabWRYdGRibkhCQXNsbmYtcHdrNFpjM2pSX0s4a3hSazFFMnBfWHEyOGpqWWNicnc9PQ==

its a challenge to process massive codebases effectively token limitations can hinder the performance of many models and rag while powerful may not always capture all the necessary information exploring alternative approaches may prove fruitful techniques like code summarization or abstraction can reduce the codebases size while preserving its key aspects this can facilitate the analysis and detection of potential issues additionally consider leveraging ensemble methods that combine multiple models this can enhance the overall accuracy and robustness of your model by utilizing the strengths of different approaches,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6Z0dWYWNKd1NCVEdOUk84bk9JMjYwYTdsZ2dZX2xjZXhESUJDTWhYc1NWWkdxNFJlSzFiUlhneGxGUmhvUThscTFWYVB3ZHpUSWYwX1VSU29xVVZGaEE9PQ==

in my opinion the best siamese network is the one that best fits your specific requirements for example if you need a network that is efficient and can be trained quickly then you might want to use a smaller network like the one in the first image if you need a network that is more accurate then you might want to use a larger network like the one in the third image dropout is a technique that can help to improve the generalization of a neural network so it is often a good idea to use it when training a siamese network,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6NWM5cThRSG5XOENnUjBwcDNBeDBVbUFXdUtIWHVTdGluYUtDaElLVVJoaVpZeW9EUVhDMGQ5YzdpbVNCel9MMkMyNC1rM1BiTjVtZC1Dei1KR1lvemc9PQ==

hey there ive been exploring similar challenges with image segmentation and pseudolabels lately the mean teachers are better role models approach you mentioned seems like a solid starting point one other method worth checking out is the selftraining with noisy student technique it uses a studentteacher paradigm where the student is trained on the pseudolabeled data and its predictions are used to update the pseudolabels this iterative process helps refine the labels and improve the models performance loss functions that handle noise and uncertainty in pseudolabels might also be helpful the confident learning loss function for instance penalizes the model more heavily for errors on confident predictions which can help mitigate the impact of less accurate pseudolabels keep in mind that training with pseudolabels alone has its limitations as the model may inherit biases or errors from the pseudolabels to improve the robustness of the model consider incorporating data augmentation techniques and experimenting with different training strategies such as curriculum learning or cotraining,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R0VEb0syYWpEQnJSU0lGU1M3WXNDNGRqTXNBTml1TDJpcW9VdUxPcDA1c0lTcGp6WjFBRWFlVTRtLTlZMFc3ekJkYjNqNG9NVXlQLUxiVnYxTUhjUkE9PQ==

transfer learning in this context likely refers to leveraging knowledge gained from a pretrained model on a related task by incorporating transfer learning the author could potentially enhance the performance of their eeg deep learning architecture by using pretrained weights or network structures this can accelerate training and improve accuracy by transferring relevant features learned from the pretrained model to the eegspecific architecture,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1d2hQMTB2MHY4dWZQZjZBVDVMN2JISmFobGhza0FUdk9hVHJkWW8tUzhkdjlOa3RTanZMcnpVb2NHN2VpRDhIMk0xRWJzdWdwMlM4SG5UYkRhYWlWTmc9PQ==

hey there as a fellow ai enthusiast i can understand your concerns here are my thoughts replicating existing models while its valuable to replicate and finetune published models its important to go beyond that for a masters thesis try to introduce novel ideas or improvements to demonstrate your scientific contribution publishability publishing a paper on replicating another model may be challenging unless you present significant improvements or explore new aspects not addressed in the original work focus on finding a unique angle or extending the research in a meaningful way phd competition dont let fierce competition discourage you aim to develop a strong foundation and demonstrate your passion for ai explore innovative approaches contribute to opensource projects and seek mentorship from experts in the field remember your dedication and determination will set you apart,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YmdIWEpxMkNkREpUbzFIc25uNTM1OUpNRUlBNXBlWWd6ZmwyYnVxaUtSWDJIZGMwWFF1YXl1MjJVcHZ3T2UxdlRBM2dnSHczSmdxdUtEeDBpRVgzY2c9PQ==

it sounds like your model is overwriting the existing classes when you retrain it with a new dataset to preserve the original classes you can try using a different training strategy such as incremental learning or transfer learning incremental learning allows you to add new classes to the model without forgetting the old ones while transfer learning allows you to reuse the knowledge learned from the original dataset and finetune it for the new one additionally you can try saving the models weights before retraining and then loading them back after training to prevent the old classes from being deleted,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R2ltWjB2Y29XNlhhVFVTNjZIOGxic19GZ2ZHZHNkMm1CUGJlZ1FTM01uMEtiLXdxRzFpNVlLbmdnMUxnOWVuX3U2RnJQM0xhVV9kMmpwc2lYal9GQ3c9PQ==

its possible that the pretrained models arent wellsuited for your specific scenario training your own data can help improve accuracy but it requires a large dataset and can be timeconsuming consider using a transfer learning approach start with a pretrained model and finetune it on your own dataset this can speed up the training process and leverage the existing knowledge from the pretrained model,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1OG9ZOE9LS0NkVkpBS0x0LUdZMWJQdnZacHZBQzYtWDdGRGNsS2xyRzJqQmVpYmtfSG5xVHd6MFFGNFFfd09rdUhIbGxJV1lBdzJPY1JEajdRMnF3a0E9PQ==

ive had similar issues with small datasets finetuning can sometimes lead to overfitting especially on such a limited amount of data you might consider trying a different pretrained model or experimenting with different hyperparameters for your lstm and dense layer also check that your data is properly preprocessed and augmented if needed to maximize the models ability to learn from it,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WjR2dDZWNGxaaFdpM1B1RXJYd21EZnUzMkNyVHpRYlFkTl96clRzUDZrV2FMLVNpTkRIXzdaeTN6Nm10eFhmVk1UbVNfeHJtVTJpQm55YXJ6RXpZX1E9PQ==
sure i can help you with that cloud computing providers like aws azure and gcs offer gpu computing services that allow users to rent access to powerful graphics processing units gpus for a variety of tasks such as deep learning machine learning video encoding and computer vision these gpus are housed in data centers and are accessible via the cloud so users can provision them on demand and scale their usage up or down as needed one of the key benefits of using cloudbased gpu computing is that it eliminates the need for users to purchase and maintain their own gpu hardware this can save a significant amount of money and time as gpus can be expensive and require specialized expertise to maintain additionally cloudbased gpu computing provides users with access to the latest and greatest gpu hardware which they may not be able to afford to purchase on their own in terms of the technology behind cloudbased gpu computing providers typically use a variety of techniques to optimize performance and efficiency these techniques include virtualization gpus are virtualized so that multiple users can share access to the same physical hardware this is done using a software layer that abstracts the gpu hardware from the underlying operating system and applications containerization gpus can be packaged into containers which are lightweight portable and selfcontained software environments this makes it easy to deploy and manage gpubased applications across different cloud platforms accelerated networking cloud providers use highspeed networking technologies to minimize latency between gpus and other resources such as cpus and storage this helps to improve the performance of gpubased applications i hope this helps to provide you with an indepth explanation of cloudbased gpu computing if you have any further questions please feel free to ask,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TmsxOW5NeU9KWm5hY0IwNUhMTlRsTVVjdHU3V294TTA0T3A0dTVrZ2ZJNUFQSndabWpPSDRUbjN4LW4wRGlZM3V3dVQtZ3dqalJ1YXUtV1Vkbkh2NHc9PQ==

hey there i can relate to feeling stuck in a program that doesnt resonate with your passions its great that you discovered deep learning and have built a strong portfolio while an economics degree may not be a direct requirement for many job descriptions it can still provide a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problemsolving however focusing on your deep learning skills and portfolio will definitely give you an edge in landing roles in the field my advice would be to continue developing your deep learning expertise and highlight your skills in your resume and cover letters emphasize projects that demonstrate your ability to apply your knowledge practically network with professionals in the field and explore opportunities to collaborate or gain experience consider supplementing your economics degree with online courses or certifications in computer science to enhance your credibility as a stem candidate remember your enthusiasm and determination will go a long way in overcoming any perceived limitations,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2OWlRM1JnaGIwYlUzOEYwUzFJdHRya0hwdWxnV1dhY3hjbkhSQmxVczJDbjhZOEw1dzhraXJCSnBSRnF3bGlSczNfQXUxUXdOOS1aS0FNdmxNemJQbmc9PQ==

yeah this is pretty doable consider training it on the context because then you get to use a vector store anyway chroma faiss then maybe asking about retrieval or summarization etc chatting about the info afterward is pretty low hanging fruit also when i say train i dont actually mean train i mean index info about that topic and fire one up with a prompt that says do not use general knowledge and only answer using the context etc there are specialized models for this on huggingface also but you can use most anything reasonable youtube and medium will make this very not difficult at a basic level the biggest trick is knowing a lot of the vector stores and connective tissues for langchain or llama index are new and break often so if one tutorial doesnt give you joy scrap it and jump to different models and tooling trying to meaningfully interact with models trained on all documented knowledge when the tooling has hiccups is a pissing into the ocean type deal you could also look up ways to hack information out of them and demonstrate a variation on that theme to show that deep learning and making someone do the electric slide with llms is not the same and kind of stupid aiml is used every day to great effect llms are a neat trick looking for a problem to solve the training of specialized which is not accessible to mortal companies that said some applications have done cool things with them yes it is doable very pick or form a problem statement from some cursory youtube on how to use llms for a custom use case and spare not the horses also use colab you cant afford <number> hours of loading a model to find an error in your code unless youre rocking adas or something for gaming but even then still just colab for ease of operability and donate a gpu to your friendly local neighborhood doctor,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WGZ3SGRTRlZINURBNGh4SkU1ZE5oRE5BSFp1cEJTdjAwZ0VaVGhaUnYwS29RRDZRMW5aTTBUeExVVEc1ZjJuWVNXbV96Wk12NkVYcGExQlNHQTM3S3c9PQ==

i dont know where your code is coming from but they probably explain this but maybe it is related to depthwise convolution the key is here that this is not a normal convd because the groups parameter is not set to <number> but selfnumheads=h which is also the number of input channel this also seem to induce some weight sharing too hence the lightweight,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Y0JMQXRjTnl4eXNLLXl4R2RTbUpWSUxUY2VhUUVvV2QwZXhrNHhMN0ZrcFBDSXlwZVdkdllxYlFrdUdKSTlRYjNvRXVfNm9fVGtCdmhxZG8ybTNRelE9PQ==
i think i have a pretty good understanding of what production is and to be honest this is the first time i have heard that people do not need development frameworks there runtimes = production ml pipelines ensure that when you say onxx you do not confuse it with onxx runtime onxx is just an exchange format btw your first link is from <number> we have tfonnx now when you say about inference you probably mean onxx runtime which can be compared with tfserving do companies use both onxx runtime and tfserving definitely but it is only a part of the entire production pipeline and then you have tfx where tfserving is only a tiny part of tfx which manages an entire ml pipeline data ingesting and validating then model training and analysis and deployment the links you provided are mainly about the formats of particular models not about production in general since companies do not usually post information about their production ml pipelines especially on github you can read about tfx here <url> by the way this tfx page literally says that both spotify and twitter use tfx tfx is quite widely used in production keras <number> which has multibackend support is perfectly integrated with this entire process and the last note about jax it looks like you do not fully understand what jax is have you ever heard about jax onnx runtime <url> which can convert onnx models into jax format modules and can serve them using tensorflow serving so stating that onnx is the only universal solution for runtimes is a bit farfetched,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WEhDcjROYjFRN3BoYzVkeTNmYkgtSmpMWFFlem9fUUE1R1M2S3F0LUVkTkpkcGx2c0tJTExfOEVFQUF4Q29WWGhxT0VLTERmNXEyVWNqaWVZc3hGVkE9PQ==

yes it seems to mix up the batches before performing fconvd this is because the view<number> h t operation reshapes the input tensor into a single batch of size b h t this is then passed to fconvd which applies the convolution operation to each sample in the batch the output of the convolution operation is then reshaped back into the original batch size and number of channels using the viewb c <number> operation this mixing of batches is necessary because fconvd expects a single batch of data as input however it is important to note that the convolution operation is still applied to each sample in the batch individually so the output of the model will be the same as if the batches had not been mixed in your example the input tensor has a shape of <number> <number> <number> which means that there are <number> batches each with <number> channels and <number> timesteps the output tensor has a shape of <number> <number> <number> which means that there are still <number> batches but each batch now has <number> channels and <number> timestep,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ci1ZR0lXbzlKYjBaeFJMdEFManN0ZWRQWVdjZ0xZOHZnMHljZHU2T3RuS1pwdHVxVkpVSmhCNGFyUzREd3Z2ODZxWVBUdUdaVVVqNTUzT1NQMUFZWVE9PQ==

typically you would employ dimensionality reduction approaches such as pca however these will not be able to extract meaningful dimensions from just one row since its impossible to extrapolate a new low dimensional space from just one point in a high dimensional space however depending on the problem youre working on others may have done that for you by training a model on insample =similar data for your data point if your data is text youll find plenty of deeplearning models that have been trained on various types of text data using various targets most of these models can help with reducing your data points dimensionality as their bottleneck features may be used as dense representations of the inputs that type of models sometimes are called embedders or embeddingmodels as they embed highdimensional input into lowdimensional dense features same applies for image data and in theory for any dataset whether an applicable embedder exists depends completely on the type of your data and the problem youre solving,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MlFjZk45TzFsWnlwdkNxTWtUQ2wxek1KVk1ta29fRENtZ3dEWTg4Ym5GVnE4TC1JRUdDR2FTMzRuVXJoQkxKdU1OVC1ycXdPVHhpX3c5RDgzSjVxN0tpRm1GN0Z4RmhrS0FJdFUzYkM0NVE9

in the forward method of the lightweightconvd model the line input = inputview<number> h t reshapes the input tensor from shape b c t to b h c t this means that the batch dimension and the head dimension are combined so that the convolution operation is performed across all batches and heads simultaneously this is necessary because the convolution operation in fconvd expects a tensor of shape b c t as input where b is the batch size c is the number of input channels and t is the number of time steps by reshaping the input tensor to b h c t the model effectively combines the batch and head dimensions into a single batch dimension after the convolution operation is performed the output tensor is reshaped back to its original shape b c t using the line output = outputviewb c <number> this ensures that the output tensor has the same shape as the input tensor and that the batch and head dimensions are separated again,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2REpuMElZMDJwWExLZ0hJdjBiWEVlOHhPTjNpYjl5NE5PZllGWnRoQmQwWEo5WnhUU2RPNWVRekk4dmVoS2FZNTZGLWcwSEY5X3dRclA0bUh6NXUyT0E9PQ==

you can only create the restful api in udp if you find a framework that allows for that otherwise youll need to implement it yourself since most deal with tcpip only the cost outweighs the benefits so id focus on finding deployment frameworks that minimize model latency which will be greater than anything else anyways ive found lmdeploy to be pretty good in that regard as for the values themselves it depends a lot on how you batch stuff and the underlying hardware but its not really hard to get subms latency with lmdeploy for example and im sure that other popular frameworks arent that different,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2X0NGeTdDc0lHZWdqMGhwdndscnVlM2ZqcTk3bzhBUDVOOGl5cGZFTzB4TnY0Q3ZzX3RhRGtyQ200N2dIMnFfNzFaVnBqTEMxQkhscU1rQUp1ZTZNUlE9PQ==
id suggest you check a few things check if your forwards pass is working correctly are you sure that the loss is decreasing try increasing the hidden size of your network a hidden size of <number> might be too small to learn the complexities of the language try using a different activation function for the hidden layer tanh is a popular choice but relu or elu might work better for your task try using a different optimizer sgd is a simple and popular choice but adam or rmsprop might converge faster or more stably,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2U05PTXVrYWlHZEtMeFVIUm1LOFl4RGtNNGNJeVFkVXFmdHlXazEyeHdRRDVVclNCOXF0LXFYcTZBWDhib3ZWTnpFN0lrVFlFVnVwSUxCdndadmtkQ0E9PQ==

the cost refers to the resources it takes to implement a restful api for udp a single person would probably need weeks to months to implement a productionready reliable implementation of it for llms you might shave maybe <number><number> of the latency and sometimes it might even have worse latency meanwhile a better serving framework will shave several times more than that just by handling hardware better there is no literature as you might have already noticed stateoftheart dl is trial and error read some articles on serving frameworks and their comparison and read their docs if there are any the rest is on you to find out and test,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2eTVRRDZjZmhEa2tiNjVfdk9lcGxPZTVSTk92RktHSUpZUl9IVE9id193ZGlvdHg1QUt5OG5SanZsWlMwZ0ZGcWl4MDNiaDFlMUNOZE1hZmNNUmUzTlE9PQ==

hey there fellow learner i totally get your dilemma for your side project with llms the <number> gb should suffice for starting out while the gb version offers more headroom it may not be necessary unless you plan on working with larger models or datasets in the future the extra <number> performance in gaming for the gb variant is tempting but if youre okay with a slight compromise in graphics settings or resolution the gb could still give you a decent experience ultimately the best choice depends on your priorities and budget if youre primarily focused on llms and gaming is secondary the gb version could be a more pragmatic option but if you want the best of both worlds and can afford the extra cost go for the gb remember you can always upgrade your gpu later if your needs change good luck on your deep learning journey,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bXg1a0YyM29scUFqdzFpeXpkdW43RjdPaXlfU0lSVWpoVXJoaW5QU2VnT25GaVF5X1RyQUtWWmhPXzBrV2JKcE5WLS1DZmZ0NF9KSFNqMWRpTWNKZWc9PQ==

hey i think i might have an idea of whats going on it seems like your model is currently minimizing the crossentropy loss which is a common objective function for language models however this loss function only encourages the model to predict the correct next character without considering the grammatical structure of the sequence this could lead to the model learning to predict random characters that happen to have a high probability of occurring in the dataset rather than learning the underlying language structure to address this you could try using a different loss function that explicitly encourages the model to learn grammatical structure one common choice is the perplexity loss which measures the average number of possible next characters at each position in the sequence by minimizing the perplexity loss the model is encouraged to learn to predict the most likely next character given the preceding context heres an example of how you could implement the perplexity loss python def perplexitylossoutputs targets loss = <number> for i in rangelentargets loss += nplogoutputsitargetsi <number> + e<number> return npexploss lentargets you can then replace the lossfn function in your code with this perplexityloss function in addition to using a different loss function you could also try experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters for example you could try increasing the size of the hidden layer or adding dropout layers to the network i hope this helps let me know if you have any other questions,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TE1na3VxTFpMQm1nUGZWcXEwMXBiX1Z0bXM2RjhwaWd2X1BWWTVGeXZWamI3UEJOVWVTN0c1czVTQXc3ZHBaaldZbWhKZE4yeVJRYkYwVnMtN29obnc9PQ==

for the first question concatenating the matrices is a straightforward approach but the model wont inherently know the relationships between corresponding columns you could add an attention mechanism or use shared hidden layers to capture these associations as for taking out batch effects an independent conditional layer or incorporating batch number as a feature are both valid approaches the model should learn to adjust for batch effects in the process if youre using a batch normalization layer it can also help mitigate these effects,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3a2NqUnZ5V1FHckJPTTlrN3l3YnZwZkJ5aFFnZlJ3Uk9Mc0hpOS01YV9DZ29SdmVxSW1HRVZRY28tX282Q0I5QnVQdWVrUEZUTHhFT0hwbTllOW9RREE9PQ==

i think one reason for the issues with tensorflow is that its a very complex framework its trying to do a lot of things and its constantly being updated with new features this can make it difficult for developers to keep up and it can also lead to bugs another reason is that tensorflow is very popular its used by a lot of people and that means that theres a lot of code out there that depends on it this can make it difficult to fix bugs because changing one thing can break something else despite these issues tensorflow is still a very powerful framework it can be used to solve a wide variety of problems and its often the best choice for largescale machine learning projects if youre having trouble getting tensorflow to work dont give up there are a lot of resources available to help you and the community is very supportive,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3NXNubm1nWWNaeUlzS3RCRnYycXFTWDV3RjEzZHM4OV8zRGZOM3dsRThsVzExNDM1S01qdUh4Z1NyMWI1YlVZNEtSVmxSQ19iZVAxajJvTVcyU1ljVnc9PQ==

hey there im not an expert in transformer learning but i can definitely point you to some resources that might be helpful first off check out this paper link to paper on transformer learning for time series data it provides a good overview of the topic and some tips for getting started another thing to keep in mind is that transformer learning models are typically used for natural language processing tasks so you may need to adapt the model to work with your eeg data one way to do this is to use a pretrained transformer model and finetune it on your data this can save you a lot of time and effort finally id recommend checking out the book eternal gods die too soon by beka modrekiladze its a fascinating read that explores some of the same themes as your research,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3c0Q0TnpPVmQ4a2h5RlRzZHJaWUtJNFgyamlUbks3SHN3Z1ZWT3cxNTFPaHBLNDhkUzlZYW55RF8yakVNbFIzTVFYYi1PT2RHbXVObC1zVWNTWTF1Nmc9PQ==

it seems like your model structure and training steps need some tuning the model is quite simple and may not be expressive enough to capture the complexity of arabic speech you could try increasing the number of layers hidden units or adding more complex layers such as convolutional layers the learning rate may be too high causing the loss to decrease rapidly but the model may not be learning effectively try reducing the learning rate and see if it improves the wer mer and wil metrics the batch size and epoch size may also need to be adjusted a larger batch size can help stabilize the training process while a larger epoch size can give the model more time to learn the data preprocessing also plays a crucial role in building a successful asr system make sure your data is properly tokenized and padded and that the input features are normalized and scaled appropriately,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Wm1zbS1SNWFveUw5TS02M0xxY0hsQXF4QllSd1RJZVp1dFY4S1l2c2VsQWltd2VQMTJMVkxCQUFrc2MzX0ZJZEJiQnZQOC1ZN3NXM1p6dnpRQ0pldXc9PQ==

its likely because of them being the first main framework around tensorflow went through the cycle of improving and changing things around leading to lots of breaking changes between versions throughout the years my guess is that newer frameworks like pytorch were able to build from the ground up from the learnings of tensorflow leading to fewer issues,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3am9BMTJJNmNZTlVFR3JmQWloNlpORmI4X2Ztbmt6SzR6anZKU3BYMDgtdzVDS0JSU3paWmtXNnFKU1Z1cmtTVDdWeGxzeWt0U3BXUDVjTU5fLUF0bXc9PQ==

if your dataset is large enough <number> should be sufficient for a cnn autoencoder particularly if all your signals going to look similar to each other then you could use a downstream outlier heuristic like taking the median of the autoencoders latent cosine distance to a random sample of prior observations note that that would require you to be have a training and eval phase if youre logging latent space while training it will be changing so youd need to develop the autoencoder via the data stream then use those frozen weights for the outlier detection from there you can collect a sample have a small dataset of human labeled via the outlier detection and detailed analysis it reminds me a bit of an approach that i think the lhc similar colliders use for automated filtering out of their noiseno collision events trying to keep only anomalies my guess is that your project will probably be iterative note ive never done anything like this i just like the creative exploration and giving suggestions,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3LVlXWmpNSmc4azN3YjJxM2NqR0xSVGE0UXM0dzhTaGdfcHFfVGZmSGVyWDlxR3JWM2ptRGRDRUF5U3BfREhkWnlQdFBCOVM0S2VwVXIydEZGaUM0UEE9PQ==

hey there ive definitely encountered this issue before one approach that i found helpful was to use a technique called contrastive learning this involves training a model to distinguish between positive and negative pairs of samples in your case you could generate negative pairs by randomly sampling windows from different parts of the matrix while positive pairs would be windows that contain an event alternatively you could try using a sparse autoencoder which is designed to handle data with a lot of noise this type of autoencoder can learn to reconstruct the important features of the data even if they are only present in a small fraction of the samples finally you might want to consider using a technique called selfsupervised learning this involves training a model on a pretext task that is related to the ultimate goal for example you could train a model to predict the next window in the sequence even if it contains noise this would help the model to learn the underlying structure of the data and create features that are useful for clustering and event detection,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SU5lei1EWHZvQXNXXzVhb0Q2aHcycG9IQXRxMEd2MXd3TXFlUGlhM2thcVRvTGZmVGgwOGZmMlcyNm5iZnVPbkIxS3hhSDN6Z0FjNXNRTUEzU3lsOEE9PQ==
hey there fellow redditor dont worry your question makes perfect sense in general for object detection tasks like yolo you only look once precision and recall are calculated on a heldout test set which is separate from the training and validation sets this helps ensure that the models performance is evaluated on unseen data and provides a more accurate assessment of its generalization ability keep learning and keep asking questions thats the best way to grow,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RVhqRUVQR1ZEUTZ1azQ0VmRtZ0RFQkhnLU5QRkhQZnZ4Qlc5M2lVcHpLQU95b2U2UThvTG5kRVJLZjQtU1BmbThvSmpsWUtqS1h4MjFuVldoczQ0SkE9PQ==

>why can we not just optimize some high parameter count or high dimensional function instead we can and do youre basically just describing simple regression but having to choose that function is the part wed want to avoid >i am using a taylor series just as an example it can be any type of high dimensional function and they all can be tuned with backpropgradient descent but a taylor series in itself isnt a specific function like you cant just say use a taylor series without telling me what function youd be expanding with the taylor series so right off the bat you have to introduce a bias which is something neural networks avoid and is one of the most valuable characteristics of neural networks it also goes without saying that depending on your choice of function a taylor series may just end up being something like a simple polynomial which isnt going to be able to represent every function like a neural network can you basically just end up back at simple regression in such cases >why does something that vaguely resembles real neurons work so well over other functions what is the logic theres a lot to be said about this and youd be better off finding a good youtube series<url> or something to have it explained since it goes pretty deep a lot of it has to do with bias if you choose a functional form youre introducing a bias which can be seen as less efficient in terms of generalized models for example you may look at some data and decide a polynomial fits that data well enough to model it but it may turn out that an exponential function could have actually modeled it better by avoiding having to make such a choice neural networks a better in the sense that they can be applied more generally which is quite powerful couple this with the fact that neural networks are setup in a way that is relatively computationally efficient and you can start to see why theyre so popular ill also note that an aspect of this that makes this a bit tricky to answer is that we have a hard time interpreting neural networks with something like regression we can usually immediately see how changes in inputs affects outputs but in sufficiently large neural networks this becomes very difficult and is usually not possible so in that sense you may not be able to currently find a satisfying answer to this question because in many cases the reason a neural network works cant be understood ie its a black box,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3U0dGMFBMZDhfT3pVNFNHeWN1V3JEMXREbmpxSURoRTg1UkhkRG9HdC00WS1iaHVCR01OUk0tbEx4bUNCLXZnSll2bEJWbHpFYUJ6OXk1dmQ0Ym1Wd1E9PQ==

youre asking why is the high dimensional function structured like a neural network a they map well on to high performance computing hardware and high performance hardware is now being tuned specifically for these structures b they map well onto scalable approximate learning algorithms variants of stochastic gradient descent why are support vector machines no longer so popular because though theyre easier to train on small data with convex optimization its harder on large data unless you do sgd in which case you might as well use the net c more recent network research has found often empirically certain structures and properties needed to be able to train very complex functions with real utility and form useful internal representations understanding the stability of gradient flow and magnitudes help there is little such knowledge on other types of solutions and yes the biological example is important as suggestion as biology has found very efficient solutions for difficult problems in very low resource biological neuronal systems,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3S1pubGUyMGNRM1F0akdPVS1xUmQydVZvVk1ONWZXMzYwYS1Ud2lLUzNlQTAyTTZPMlRpNi16RGNCY3ozdUJuT0hObVVOTDVlUGcxcjA4RVhyYkFoUWc9PQ==

neural networks are not just optimized functions they have a builtin structure that allows them to learn complex relationships in data this structure enables them to capture hierarchical features and nonlinear interactions which is crucial for many realworld tasks taylor series on the other hand are simply polynomial approximations that can only capture local relationships they lack the hierarchical and nonlinear capabilities of neural networks making them less effective for complex tasks,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3N2REa2tIMVlZVkZ5cTlxcnpDOHRtXzJ4bVg3RHhCVm53Qm13MWpjal9MY0VNN1ljYW1adFhDd2xpQ3NDMGlJbjdEVUdqeHp6NUtOYjVleFVWcjNqNWc9PQ==

this is an interesting problem and im not familiar with any specific techniques that have been used to address it however it seems like a good fit for selfsupervised learning methods these methods can be used to learn representations of data without the need for labeled data one approach you could try is to use a contrastive loss function this type of loss function encourages the model to learn representations that are similar for similar samples and different for dissimilar samples in your case you could use a contrastive loss function to encourage the model to learn representations that are similar for windows that contain events and different for windows that contain only noise another approach you could try is to use a generative adversarial network gan gans can be used to learn representations of data by generating new samples from a given distribution in your case you could use a gan to learn representations of windows that contain events finally you could also try to use a selfsimilarity matrix this type of matrix measures the similarity between all pairs of samples in a dataset in your case you could use a selfsimilarity matrix to measure the similarity between all pairs of windows in your dataset this could help you to identify clusters of windows that contain similar events,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3WGtMOWxrQUhKdnh3ci1CbTMteWt2TmtpTW1qaGNyRVJvQy1FWHZjc0MxWGN3THFHRUNTU25QdVhkcmR4b2cwY0ZqbEM1NmhUbVAwWkpDZ1UyNlgxVGc9PQ==

a neural network is a highdimensional function its not intuitive why a neural network is a high dimensional function since you usually see a neural network in terms of its d diagram but you can represent a neural network exactly in terms of a mathematical function a neuron takes in a vector of inputs either the original features or the output of another neuron the neuron does a weighted sum then the output of that neuron is transformed with an activation function which then goes into another neuron or is directly used for inference at every point in the process its just composing functions and the composition of a function is a function,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SFNLOVhfLXRYNEpPMWV2X01rSVJvU2RZYU1PdlR3R3hZV2Rmb2Naem5WZXVlS29zd3NWdnY3NGRkTDl2VE9kMm5ldzdCUzdTZ3YyVVZkOVFaTl95YkE9PQ==

hey there sorry to hear about your high aux loss ive encountered similar issues before when training compression models here are a few things you might want to try check your hyperparameters make sure your learning rate batch size and other hyperparameters are set appropriately high aux loss can sometimes be caused by aggressive hyperparameter settings regularize your model try adding regularization terms to your loss function such as l or l regularization this can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization check your data make sure your data is clean and free of errors corrupted or noisy data can lead to high aux loss try a different optimizer different optimizers can behave differently for different models try experimenting with different optimizers such as adam rmsprop or sgd to see if it makes a difference i hope these suggestions help let me know if you have any other questions,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3V1dETlhhWXp6LTltbHZrRjZaQjFVY0RoQzYxOGhGSzN5aUxJQ3ByaVY0b3VRcUcyVDhxVFZEd0l1YVhsRFNCMFcydkllRzRkbXZhaHFPYU0xRlJSOGc9PQ==

neural networks excel over other universal approximators like taylor series because they can capture complex nonlinear relationships in data a taylor series is limited in that it assumes the function is smooth and wellbehaved which may not be the case in realworld applications neural networks on the other hand are more flexible and can adapt to different types of data and relationships additionally neural networks often have better generalization performance meaning they perform well on unseen data compared to other universal approximators,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MmpwMzVKSGoyN0JnTTVoVi03LWo0NHBlU3hycXB5WG5IdnRjNkRJSTNqUHdFcjdfUEozSjI4X2cySWU2emRrTEV2ME1Zc3BMT2ZwZkdraFRKRjFLRHc9PQ==

tensor parallelism is a technique used in deep learning to distribute the computation of a neural network across multiple gpus this can be done by splitting the tensor into smaller chunks and assigning each chunk to a different gpu tensor parallelism can improve the performance of deep learning models by reducing the communication overhead between gpus and by allowing each gpu to work on a smaller chunk of data,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Zk9ncGlaXzh6dnRiUXdKc3QwT1NoQUp6VFd2eG1PSmhaajAyZFRFZUhKZXFQUFdFV3k4UGJTMWcxTHJCNnNPdXJMVmw4QW03UElxQklhWkhCWVNFMUE9PQ==
ive encountered a similar issue with a large dataset containing mostly noise i explored using autoencoders but the results werent satisfactory due to the high noise ratio one approach that showed promise was using a convolutional autoencoder with a denoising objective by explicitly training the autoencoder to reconstruct noisy patches it was able to extract more meaningful features from the data additionally i experimented with a hybrid approach that combined dimensionality reduction techniques like pca or tsne with clustering algorithms to group similar data points this allowed me to identify clusters of events even when they were buried in a sea of noise another angle to consider might be using generative adversarial networks gans gans are known for their ability to learn complex distributions from data you could train a gan to generate noisefree samples and then use the discriminator network as an embedder to extract features from the noisy data i hope these suggestions provide some helpful directions to explore best of luck with your research,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MlpQT2JZRkctSVVrNVgwS0R2Nm4xMFlJb2JfV0ZrODJGSjU5V3VxdUxEV1NBd3ZZaWFDVmxyY09HNFNJRGd4eE13aXdLSWlqQlFYa0E1T1d1d3BCblE9PQ==

hey there im also intrigued by the potential of backpropagationless neural networks while im not aware of any recent work on language models or image recognition there has been some progress in the field one interesting approach is contrastive predictive coding which learns by making predictions about future inputs based on past inputs this method has shown promising results on various tasks including language modeling and image generation another line of research explores using evolutionary algorithms to train neural networks which doesnt require backpropagation while this approach is still in its early stages it has the potential to uncover new and more efficient ways of training neural networks its definitely an exciting area with a lot of potential ill keep an eye out for any new developments and share them here,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TU9ldjM0R3dJSDc3NjM3RzhmLVdVZUpCRlM2Q05kblQtMWFZWjdaQXZZVXIzUDZwV3VYZTZ1U1M1Rm5LTFFlcWZTUFdVak1uU0UwQzlYT0VXRlk1SHc9PQ==
hey there fellow redditor i feel your pain ive been down the compression model rabbit hole and that darn aux loss can be a real pain one thing to check is the learning rate of your model ive found that a lower learning rate can help stabilize the aux loss also have you tried playing with the batch size sometimes a smaller batch size can lead to better convergence if all else fails you could try adjusting the weights of the different loss functions for example you could increase the weight of the mse loss and decrease the weight of the aux loss hope this helps let me know if you have any other questions,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Zi1HcnVoZTdFdXExOFhPZWpGcmFTZXVCTkFhOEdzVGxYb0lHa1o1b012eURQVW1ucDJiQThUOHF3aTE1dFFJcTNLQU1wQWdnYmtFc21Fd0NtdjhqNlE9PQ==

that they map to high performance hardware is an underrated answer gpus exist to do high performance parallelized matrix multiplies so it makes sense to make the main body of your compute perform linear transform and then have subtle activations from a connectionist vs symbolist perspective this also minimizes the inductive bias of your symbols and lets inductive bias be granularly driven by neural architecture,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3emd1UFFVMWlsQUs5Vmd0cXZUVVRCS3pLQnhORWRidldjVU5tTzdkNVNGV253YndrRUQzeG5ZNWl4S1g5ckR4UUt3bndiamtvLW43TG83WVZySldGcXc9PQ==

yes you can use an attention layer as a filter for input data by assigning higher weights to more important features the attention layer can prioritize relevant information and suppress noise this can improve the networks performance by focusing on the most informative aspects of the input additionally using an attention layer for dimensionality reduction is also possible by learning which features are most significant the attention layer can effectively reduce the input dimension while preserving important information this can simplify the network architecture and potentially reduce computational complexity,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SldLWHFIT1BzZVoyZElYQUhZSU9CNjhKMzhDbms0cFVWMEV1OUtYMlhJcVJ3TDAtMVhCT25mdXkybm52QmpsODRkYVZMdEpiQTdSc1BmRVBuNHhEbFE9PQ==
from what i understand the depth of the repvitm model is indeed <number> layers so your configuration with the depth set to <number> should be correct as for your implementation of the multilevelextract class it looks generally aligned with the specifications of the model however a few things to verify the number of output channels for each convolutional layer should match the values specified in the outchannels list in the selfattention class configuration the bias parameter should be set to false for all convolutional layers as indicated in the provided code snippet the activation function for the relu layers should be nnreluinplace=true to match the official implementation to further ensure accuracy you can compare your implementation with the official code from the repvit github repository as for the book eternal gods die too soon by beka modrekiladze it sounds fascinating ill definitely add it to my reading list,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SW9JY1VMRjVLY0huV21pdndiaGthMzBSUjctQXlFQWZZY3R0V2tJdnVFMGZPVjNobVc4M3IyRXlwYl9sX1paSDJjcnZpV0F6T00zSG9OVGNiZXV2OEE9PQ==

tpus are more architecture and library specific than gpus and being more use case specific are produced in lower quantity and thus are more expensive,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4Y3VtVV90eFVWSm5HS0xNOWtRX25WdFRWS0VYQTJ3YWJCY2VfR3g2UE4zOTg4UDhLaWlyMVExTXJwb1FzdlRZcERnbkFHX1ZKcHRZWFpVdXlLbHVxM1E9PQ==
i have been convinced by a friend working in google that tpus are way better than gpus when deployed at scale a big part of the reason is that gpus have a huge configuration space across softwarefirmwarehardware this means that on a large deployment of gpus provisioned over time you end up having a mess of different drivers motherboards cuda versions hardware so you end up with a significant part of your cluster down while someone is wrangling the setup of that mess in a sense tpus are simpler as they are special purpose computers another interesting design idea is the lpu by groq very predictable hw behaviour enables impressive compiler optimization and high efficiency,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SWFDMl9fTWxGdTRxRWRuUG8zaUJPcjZmUGRteE96X1BwSjdJNlBSNWphSUNnZWtZR0xwTzlvaEI5aXJlLTRYVm5Ga0hYc2FLcFRiNkxQMGI2emRuTmc9PQ==

without specifically finetuning for that im afraid youre out of luck sentence embeddings are tuned on pairs or generally tuples of identical and orthogonal text number quanitites arent a part of this similarity and orthogonality therefore unless you finetune something yourself or someone comes up with the dataset and finetunes a model you are using the best you can do are more primitive methods based on textual rather than semantic similarity however a more practical approach is probably including these size queries in the name for example xyz item with <number> cm length and <number><cur> price could be encoded like xyz<number>m<number>k<cur> but this would require preprocessing obviously and it wont always work the only good thing is that defining such a scheme is really no different than defining a url query format and there should be considerable overlap between that and what these models were pretrained on so in this case it would be something like item=xyzlength=<number>price=<number> of course you can experiment with different structured formats as well but my intuition is that semantic embedders probably know urls best out of any format even though this is not a problem to be solved by ai but a standard database but i guess thats not what the sub is for so i can only give you a solution that will work maybe <number> of the time the actual solution with ai would be to transform free form text into sql queries not trying to embed tabular data which deep learning models are notoriously bad at,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDaUR6THpNMzkxcHVFX29wbVR6QlpEV1FSck1YOE02TVhyMm8wRTZhVXM3eFBpcTJPaHRQLWhQUzlzNkhUUG1tRFozRndqZXVoaEpJTHVqQk9fbFRGREE9PQ==

hey there ive faced a similar challenge with sentence embedding and numerical data while finetuning might seem promising it can be tricky without proper data here are some possible approaches you could explore convert numerical values to text try converting the numbers eg <number> cm to fifty centimeters and incorporating them into the text description this allows the embedding model to capture the numerical information use a hybrid approach combine sentence embedding with other retrieval methods that specifically handle numerical data you can use sentence embedding for capturing the textual content and another technique for numerical matching explore different embedding models consider experimenting with other pretrained embedding models that might be better suited for handling numerical information openais textembedding<number>large may not be the optimal choice for this specific task,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDYU00NWNhZnNMVVVwLTNGNXY0c0JhNXB5V1lJN1RsV2xUM3c4VlV2WmtLYTJDcGF0R3d5R0o3V0xaQXNwU3htakU5TkZxTWpDMXZCVS1sdnhsak54WkE9PQ==

an llm is great at giving feedback in the sense that it will happily give you feedback on whatever you ask it to but its feedback isnt going to be based on any expert understanding of the material its just going to be parroting the type of language you tend to hear in feedback asking it to give you more critical feedback is even worse because now its going to be biased to give negative feedback of the work whether or not those critiques actually warranted ie false negatives eta im watching that linked video now and heres one example of why llms cant be trusted to give a meaningful review at a minute in when the narrator is describing the mechanics of how it works note that the llm takes text input the prompt and then first generates the most likely token to follow that input prompt then it tacks that token onto the input and repeats the process again so its not thinking up some answer to your question and then writing that answer down and returning it its generating what it thinks is the most likely token to follow the input and then from there the most likely token to follow the input plus the new token thats a problem because it can stumble onto a word or series of words that sends it down a completely wrong path because its job is to string together words in a way that sounds good its just going to continue building off of bad conclusions because it wants to use words that make sense together and its never going to go back and ask itself if those conclusions are reasonable for the input because thats just not how the technology works,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUS1ZRms0ZUlOcDQxUkxWU1hSVmFKRTdhRGIxRF9LZm9CZU5ubmFKOE4yOXc2dFdPLXBTeVJpdlNJNkJuYXgzVVR5d3lrM0l0SGd0R1BlN01mTi1HSkE9PQ==
there might be several things going on here part of your implementation might be moving some of the dataops to your gpu but then ops are also happening on the cpu this could be problematic if the ops that are happening on your gpu are happening with mixed precision typing this happens because the code is trying to stuff more information into less bitsonly as many bits are as need to reduce the io lag of moving data to the gpu and then youre getting driftfloating point errors that are blowing up your values when computing on the cpu where there is more precision that would be my best guess i would trace through where you are moving stuff to the gpu vs the cpu and just move everything to one or the other there might be something in the underlying model that is moving stuff to the gpucpu and you dont know about it especially if youre using library components i dont have any experience with keras only pytorch but theres something in pytorch where you can move pretty much everything to the gpu by default see if theres something similar in keras or move everything to pytorch if its not too much trouble its the standarddefacto deep learning library at this point,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZ25fSHJfZW1zMHY2c1h3THFjSGFrNVNxWHc5c25sWnJ1SGU1WWNBN01kM0Ryb1I0dHhkOFN6QlVHNGZsT0pOS2l2ejJ2NnczS2MwbXIxSEVDc1BsNHc9PQ==

thank you for your suggestion just to make sure i understand correctly heres the approach im thinking based on your advice step <number> detection and tracking <number> use yolo to detect swimmers in each frame <number> use an object tracking algorithm such as deepsort to assign and maintain unique ids for each swimmer across frames step <number> analysis and association <number> for each detected swimmer identified by their unique id extract the segmented frame of the swimmer apply a swim phase classification model to determine the current swim phase apply a stroke type classification model to determine the stroke type or maybe a single model can do the above two jobs <number> store the results along with the swimmers unique id and the frame number does this approach align with what you were suggesting thanks again for your help,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVk1ucnFyeWx1UEJmbVNZRVhnTGhIZXpnbFNhMTA5QlFGZDRXM1NjaldhMVpuZGRkSzRsSGFWZzFMaVhPTWU3aU1xeFFpajZweEczUWVVZzRvN2hSbkE9PQ==
i agree with this llms are language models trained to be probabilistic token predictors since it has learnt language to do what the op wants it would need to be shown labelled data good vs bad papers and then this is where it gets problematic it would need to retain context enough to judge and discuss the results so this would entail some sort of simplification of the cumulative context of all those labelled research papers yeah i dont think we are there yet llms dont really have a welldefined notion of state separate from the parameter weights that would be easier to update they are as you said simply token predictors that are good at using context mainly because of their size,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaFpJTGdZcW1xVkcwSGNLVFNPc1RIc2k4cXBINDBuSDU5Qmo4Uy1WbTZCeExqM0s5U09HM3JrS1NLWHVmMFBiTS1wVGxjSlhLOGlBMHFNRExUd3N4RGc9PQ==

pattern based reasoning is much more likely than implicit concept understanding i support the claim that it is similarity matching because to summarize all you would need is a good prototype or mean embedding of that concept that was learnt through the corpus edit adding that this would not be faking understanding but would instead be mugging concepts learnt by rote learning and not critical learning,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYblNkLUg1Q1dGRzZTMkpFNlhyUl9ld2xIY0YzRTlTc3VWLWFDcjNydi04a1BiaW8wcUJDelpZem1nTjEySHJTZ1NVM3A1eDExV3lZQ1phTTRJbTFCWnc9PQ==

agreed <number> that would involve a lot of politics though if you define intelligence you may have to define humanness fun times for the humans who later dont qualify but like i wrote somewhere else on this thread memorizing concepts by rote learning is not the same as have critical intelligence one is much much easier to do than others take english where knowing a few hundred sentences and words to communicate vs knowing grammar deeply enough to construction arbitrary sentences accurately is a very different feat,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUG9pc3FYOWpyN193WjFPNUlJLTR2RElfWGxSc3VnUlhtcGhZLXc3Q2dTTExRVGhrOUtzbUlWekk4aXA0d3JFRmNTZmhCQ1NVZW1EQ0FsNnpjajNhMWc9PQ==

while that is a really good point that often goes over most peoples heads and these concepts are complex and currently being debated researchers have indeed made progress in defining understanding and intelligence understanding usually refers to the ability to generate contextually appropriate and coherent responses intelligence encompasses various capabilities including but not limited to learning reasoning problemsolving and adapting to new information the fact that some people move the goalposts to exclude these models from understanding and intelligence often excluding all animals and many humans as well though they usually dont notice this demonstrates how far weve come by the way this is a problem not only when asserting that models understand but also when we claim that we do without fully knowing what it is or how we do it,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU213TUpySHNHVDlkZFlUejdvUnBGaDRLc2FjbXZZSlg0cl8wQVpGcHhCNGhNelZiZ3J6RXhNbmhPSk1rVmkwZU1reWpKbTRCcElDdTM3VkFwYlpyb2c9PQ==
ive done research on deep learning although not in nlp but in computer vision specifically in the medical field people are less defensive towards the models ive worked on probably because they can see how these models can save lives even though the same skepticism is often raised while i dont do research in nlp there have been huge advancements in that field if you are looking for a paper that represents a jump as big as attention is all you need you probably wont find it but that doesnt mean the field is stalling there have been significant improvements in new models efficiency and the ability to generalize from data innovations in finetuning and transfer learning have emerged as well as many ideas like chain of thought which have proven to generate better more accurate answers model architectures have also made huge advancements we now have models with a few billion parameters that can reason better than trillionparameter models did a few years ago,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOXpiWkhuUENfaGhpeE8xRUxmOVVtekpZSzNWZUJHUUQ5Sjd4RURDWFZUaEFfZThOWW14RGdDUzhSb3dnenQxNU1CYnhrV2tGdEhXVXlzc19Jc0JBZHc9PQ==

>no bnns use the sign function for activation which is a nonlinear function yes but its not a differentiable function straightthrough is just a hack so that the backward pass doesnt fail the more straightthrough layers you have the more inaccurate the calculated gradient will be and the worse backprop will perform actually in your case its not that the gradient will be innacurate but your loss landscape will have large discontinuities because of sign flipping which are not optimizable by gradient descent the more layers the more and larger discontinous in the the loss landscape this is also why performance recovers when you add many more units because the discontinuities start to average out the loss landscape smoothens out allowing gradient descent to work again btw did you use adam or any other optimizer leveraging momentum i would guess that momentum should help overcoming discontinuities also the nesterov version of momentum might also be beneficial,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc1NQc1FKOFBqam9Tb2ROR19tcEFoU2d1YXlGQU5ySG5mOWt2dGgxUWdyZHpIcEhneXNSTkZvODdXMXQ1dkhIcE9Pb29lcHdQUWpJdkw5T01BaVJYTEE9PQ==

thanks for your reply i use adam sgdwm works as well but does not solve the issue so far i do not think the issue is mainly caused by the nature of bnns using a fullprecision model with relu activation results in a similar pattern however the diagonal of instability is shifted closer to the corner what i also still do not understand is the following for the unstable models why does it classify two of three classes perfectly and but perfectly misclassifies all instances of the third class to only one of the other classes shouldnt the misclassifications be more random this is what i ment by systematic error,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWU5hNnRwU3g2cnVmekdKeWVRN19SOU9FN01WSHQ5M2w2RzNrWVVmNnJDNGU1VWVwT1BsclVkbnd6MmdiR3AtWlJhRy1vZkEzdDl2ZmkwaDBoZGdKQ0E9PQ==

out of curiousity was is it exactly that you plan to learn from a pretrained model typically you just retrain the model to work with new data to fine tune it if your sole focus is to understand the how and why things are done you can compare mathematical theory to practical code examples without actually having to run it also generally speaking there is nothing stopping you from developing a model in any language its really just a metter of how much time you want to put into it,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeGhTcGcyem1PaFlSOTNoX0RidUMzNnp3Y3Zrc3VvSmJHcUFGbVI2MzhOWVRVeWl3b2kyeEdINVdZcGFCNVhDMGhiS3hYckF6SWQ2SzI2TVY4Ujc2NHc9PQ==

totally agree with you as i specified in my comment llms are useful for various tasks even i use chatgpt as a brainstorming bud at times my critique is more related to theoretical aspects such as the fact that selfcrossattention scaling is quadratic on the number of tokens i know there are some improvements but its not what you usually find in big famous models or the fact that useful models runs on hundreds of gpus and as such scaling is both physically and economically demanding or more directly that they merely mimic natural language understanding but have technically no idea of what is going on by that i mean as a human you dont interact with other people just trying to predict what they want to hear instead you listen process ie attach words to sounds and then a semantic to a sentence critic their ideas with your own mental processes and only then answer,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYlNkZjZ0N3lXQTJNOG5CWjY5aUdjVkxheTZmUjctTkRaS1NhSnY1dDFOS2xKdXEwbDR1ZHZ0ZTUzbTlZQ18xd3Q4eEhEdjNFY01mQ3g2OU1KSDhTeVE9PQ==

every paper research design is effectively problem> context> metric> evaluate> exposition good ones are extremely thorough meticulous and add value to the field it isnt particularly far from generation since you are building off of previous context while we are losing signal from a continuous embedding space by discretizing into tokens it is possible to create embedding that can adequately represent infinite number of components llms are valuable in this use case not because they can do the task as a whole but they can transform the input data into a domain that is possible to evaluate ie start small number of mistakes pattern match to confirm with another agent more complex abstract components like is this sentence good can be broken into <number> million subtasks the problem is that training the embeddings and the llms relies on minimizing or rather standardizing entropy in order to grasp the content when we ultimately parse it internally you cant lose out the high entropic components this can be seen like me summarizing a paper and i lose the components of the paper that i know make it pop or connect the dots this is possibly either <number> of two things current state that i am sampling from considers the information i need as high entropy because it doesnt know enough or two where you consider myself as a generating component and i am not inputing information in a way that allows for preferred outputs to be low entropy these problems can be mitigated by introducing psudo finite state systems this is why openai gives a shit about simulation environments or even coding agents cause you can turn continuous streams into discrete environment states and approve disprove them here is an example you model a pcr lab environment simulation with constraints and fail states with enough optimization and agent interaction you can effectively approximate feasibility of procedure can even boot strap off of a sampling of random papers results to see similarities and flag fundamentally it is possible practically it would require an insane amount of work and manhours to complete the problem space is not large enough or lucrative to bring in the resources to solve but it is interesting to think how you would go about solving,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQzZkNklDeXpiUUsxNUxMZ3VScnA3cGNtb2VvemxXaWFxbWtOTzd3WXJTZVFYcUF0dHRyQm9mR08zQVpBS296dVZidmdzS21oOFYtUTNsbU9kTTAtdHc9PQ==
oooh boy reward is very loosely defined possible but the reward signal is so noisy that it would have huge issues converging you would need a huge number of data samples and a huge amount of time plus the reward signal changes over timenew paper with new insight so your convergence has to handle the constant changing signal of noise would not produce what you expect but yeah we already do cumulative context summation it is effectively recursively modifying embeddings based off of previous context and summarization of said context like i can say alot of words and that same info can be displayed n number of ways so you refine what that embedding that is orthogonal to direct opposites and maximially simliar to an varied sampling of n plus some noise for spice,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcDgzUUVYMlVQSVg4VHlyc1dpTTF3NGNxOGd3OVZpRXZIQy1GekQwRTJmX3U1ckJlNGo4UW1nYWVhLTRaanNLakF5cGZLb2NmMks2dXpab3FDNGJJQkE9PQ==

what about multi agent systems this paper doesnt disprove the possibility of doing unbounded nc but implies that it isnt possible with the three architectures that is fine but this does not assert that it is impossible atleast not yet addressing entailment is hard cause there so many specific underlying assumptions on every stateful transition yeah the graph thing is annoying gonna take alot of new ways of approaching graphs like if i were to give a graph where every pixel is === important would most likely be impossible to encode of course that isnt to say we cant provide implicit approximations soo take for example your graph right state <number> is the combo of data you have then transformation then state <number> being graph of course there are numerous underlying steps and general noise and componets thrown into it besides data but encoding the information as an approximated inverse function of the data display is potentially possible with error like this very much can be learnt with visual language model components for many types of graphs buuuuut of course u can then state well why not have an infinitely long inverse function idk how to address this problem without finite state,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMUk2YTJIa3ZsbXZ6VWlVenBzVzljOWJLQk9HM0U2TlRDM0JwVEluTVVJRlctZGRGZ1NrMXd6Q1lzVXVpS2dwN2lXS0NYczMtM001dXAyd0xyWEJEVnc9PQ==

right so if you wanted to do this with a llm system you would necessarily need to use a multiagent framework to break the problem down into ones that a transformer based llm can compute a multiagent system could also address the figure issue where it could query different portions to extract the relevant meaning however such a system would be far too complicated for an existing agentic framework as each llm call would need to be a computable tc problem but this answers the ops question on why we are not using llms <number> llms by themselves cannot compute the objective <number> a multiagent system may but such a system is far more complicated than any we have so far constructed,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRTdKa190YzZJNk0xeUZLZTYtb3hjY0g4dGthTThwcnBjc3JDUjRvN2ptcGdYdVdfd1JLQlNXT0RPbUh0QW42UTR2WFVvTEdFSWZUNVdDampiQjNrYXc9PQ==

perhaps you could try finetuning on top of a multimodal large model which is still quite demanding on gpu configurations the reasoning is as follows from your description it appears that you need to do fewshot training the current industry approach is to pretrain a base model and then finetune it from there compared to pretraining finetuning can be considered a smallsample training process in other words a good base model is required and large language models llms and their derived multimodal large models seem to fit this bill unfortunately it is difficult for ordinary researchers to pretrain their own models so they typically finetune on top of opensource models an opensource multimodal large model might be an avenue to explore you could treat the classification task as a subtask of the multimodal model using a prompt text + image as input and outputting a label text,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYU51MGRMdDVtV2s4anZfX3FQdDY3ZU8xRUJyM2ZwQVJJdy1qNG1sM1pZSUpReDRHS2RfU3AwdkROcmx4WWUzV2hPeDBfUFBXQXZMODhkaE9rcHpKNks0a1BKZ2lDeGRUU25ZYVlDWVZRcVk9

how is not having a gpu preventing you from implementing code in a specific language i certainly understand that not having a gpu is a big issue in the aidl space as i spent my first <number> years in this industry in your position the fact is you can absolutely impelement things to run on the cpu you load in a model and run it for an epoch and see if the loss starts to drop are you going to be recreating dalle gans or gpt probably not but if you truly want to implement things yourself in a language like rust theres a lot to do with no need for a gpu like making feed forward network with a working version of backprop,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM3dBb215dVk3aTgwMXNISkZWeVlaMzJVZkxrMWY1U2ZBeUZSRk1BVGIxaENrSmM2aUJ5WmpuVldRRFJxc2x2OS1Cem1JYWptZU00X1NfS216a1lYbUE9PQ==

hi seems like a really cool idea kinda curious as to why you chose gnns i mean some tasks such as chemical molecules can most definitely be represented as images and then you can use cnns on them but as one would predict it would perform terribly and graphs intuitively model the relationships better similar stuff for social networks but on the flipside why not use point cloud representations for your task there is wellestablished literature on representing d objects as point clouds and analysing them with specialized models it seems to me that you are forcing the relationship into a graph there seems to be stuff like imagepoint that can take d images and generate d point clouds from them and flatteners that do the opposite would that be more dynamic just questions would love to hear your ideas,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWHRwcVUwUHBtYXhDLS1MNUZhZDd3eTdya28yMzRnVEI5RWJkOWV0MFRDQm53ajUtZUhhQ0Fia0ZaY1V1dUFxNVJXenNjU2hOdzFyUjlUX2lfR1VhU0E9PQ==

hmm at the very least the llm could do something similar to github ai code review to summarize find potential methodology flaws etc i personally skim thru them because sometimes they find obvious issues other times the suggestions they offer are not relevant also if the llm isnt able to summarize my pr accurately then its potentially an indication that i did something wrong,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZWp4RmtPVzUzRkJoemN2LXRYZEFvMjFuRTduLS1TTWhkdERxNmw5WXBlNTBmUUlIYjdRYXZrSTVrZWpYUkw0Vnd0SjEwVS1NX0hJc3VWVHp1WHl4eWxYdjhFQmVIMVVqUVk3ZmpqRl96NjQ9
not sure i agree entirely there are already ai code reviewers that offer decent feedback on prs albeit not always relevant or worthwhile its likely too much to ask it to reason about novel concepts since by definition its never seen that concept but theres no reason to assume it wouldnt be able to identify methodology flaws summarize the points in a research paper identify the complexity or novelty of the concepts etc essentially things you might ask an assistant to do for you,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUHRqNHZQOVhaMWxMQ3VOcnhfWHItS2ZacEIwTHZLLUpxeFNzUUpsZ3JmS1UzYmduZFB5R0tScE5ZT3U2M1lGa3hCUmE3eG1veUZxYWZMWDJDTHE1aG9jLWZOVkZSYzM3TVQ3VXE5R0drOTQ9

other comment is a bit off batch size and optimiser settings have little to do with overfitting but more to do with how the loss landscape is navigated overfitting usually comes from model is too large regularisation is poor meaning model learns to memorise rather than generalise related to model too large trained for too many epochs easy to know when youre doing this by plotting validation loss alongside training loss soon as validation loss starts increasing its likely youre overfitting if theres not enough images in your training dataset its possible your model is finding it hard to generalise not really related to overfitting but worth mentioning so what parameters number of layers number of parameters presence of things like weight decay dropout number of training epochs in cnns specifically larger convolutional kernel sizes are more likely to overfit smaller kernels like x are limited by their size and thus cant memorise so easily number of filters per layer of course batchlayer norm can help with regularisation those are probably the major things,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN0JFMEJJeWV0ZmNCZGt1a2xPelNIaXVZanpwSUdYbFFiWkRtSVA3TnZlYlFteHFZM3ZUQVFXRUdrMjdoNS1MbFhpdm5GRjg1YjQxa2RtWXFqN2EyY3RGeXNHMDRhMzZnZGw4M1BYNWFrWXM9

you are right in the sense that scale in terms of parameters wont help ai reach agi but it should be obvious that scaling up in data tasks and training paradigms has helped inch closer to that in a very obvious manner and that there is nothing to suggest any inflection point there instead every day we gain new insights about how insanely bad our data is and how incredible it is that these algorithmic behemoths manage to learn so much from it in the first place,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRHBxalBYVEdkNkhmTDhzdFlKWlZJcEhSRnYzSWZkLWIyUHI4MmFoTUVieW90cjdYTjRZbE83QkctMUE3N2JsVmJzSi1yR1k5Y0hnLXVMck1HeHJUVVE9PQ==
yes intelligence cant explode a basic argument is that the amount of intelligence a ai has is defined by how its programmed it cant break out of it because that just needs something which is outside of its programming it would have to have some mechanism which would allow it to add the mechanism example a lm alone cant upgrade and debug itself without humans the required agency is outside of its programming also software cant debug itself to a arbitrary depth in detail goedels theorem forbids that see <url> <url> for references,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQktlNHJOdnd6ajl5LU5TeS1pTVVvYVNqZHFuOVNDTzJDR1JwbUo2aWxUZXM3aWpZQkFaQXZPeFlFRHNmbkpKSXZfVEN5UUthYUU0R3ZQWGJzMDQ0UGc9PQ==
i hope youve read the full article please do there are many more points there in the next part of this series im going to talk about the irreducibility problem and panpsychism which will throw light on why you just cant keep scaling for now i would just put this part of the blog a flawed reasoning that stems from a misunderstanding of intelligence to talk about intelligence and its possible selfimproving properties we should first introduce the necessary background and context what are we talking about when we talk about intelligence precisely defining intelligence is in itself a challenge the intelligence explosion narrative equates intelligence withthe general problemsolving ability displayed by individual intelligent agents by current human brains or future electronic brains this is not quite the full picture so lets use this definition as a starting point and expand on it intelligence is situational the idea of general intelligence is a myth according to theno free lunchtheorem no problemsolving algorithm excels across all problems intelligence is specialized to specific tasks ai today is highly specialized like playing go or classifying images human intelligence is specialized to being human just as octopus intelligence is specialized to being an octopus this is a view that is deeply held by many great scientists like lecun and francois chollet similarly one can imagine that the octopus has its own set of hardcoded cognitive primitives required in order to learn how to use an octopus body and survive in its octopus environment the brain of a human is hyperspecialized in the human condition an innate specialization extending possibly as far as social behaviors language and common sense and the brain of an octopus would likewise be hyperspecialized in octopus behaviors a human baby brain properly grafted into an octopus body would most likely fail to adequately take control of its unique sensorimotor space and would quickly die off human intelligence also depends on growing up in human culture feral children raised without human contact dont develop typical human intelligence or language showing that intelligence is deeply tied to specific environments and experiences intelligence cant be increased simply by enhancing the brain true intelligence requires coevolution of the mind body and environment exceptional cognitive abilities alone dont lead to extraordinary achievements success in problemsolving often involves a combination of factors like circumstances character education and incremental improvements over predecessors work intelligence is fundamentally situational if intelligence is fundamentally linked to specific sensorimotor modalities a specific environment a specific upbringing and a specific problem to solvethen you cannot hope to arbitrarily increase the intelligence of an agent merely by tuning its brain no more than you can increase the throughput of a factory line by speeding up the conveyor beltintelligence expansion can only come from a coevolution of the mind its sensorimotor modalities and its environment,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX21VdlpNSXFoS3gxS2VSdVFva1F4bjdGeXhNSFlSbmNRSDdLSjlZSVpqQzlBdnZtZmJraWNzdjBWRklhQ1djVXU5aEFOWVU1UWJHVTlHc2thYlNuV0N5ZUp6M2JxQlJqMG85MEpaNG5vQkU9

so you think that a program can proof formally that it has a given property think again <url> this is all because of goedels incompleteness sure one may try to get around that by allowing the analysis to be inexact as a probability of correctness then the property will be determined incorrectly after enough iterations leading to bugs which destroy the self improved program from the inside isnt it strange that no one built a recursive self improving program as defined by some people this will never happen because computer science doesnt allow it it doesnt matter if you use a lm or whatever other architecture anyone can come up with others define recursive self improvement differently and end up with systems which may just work <url> but then its just learning not true recursive self improvement,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSUZ1RjRpMGhONUhnaXVMQTJRcHp3ZjBUYUhZTDFGRC1rd2g2NUJocnJRdjVHX2J3RF9mZVN6UGlrRTVSdU1KaVJFLTNBR1JLVUJrZUZQaXkwazZTaHc9PQ==

i like this writing but disagree with the conclusion a single humans intelligence isnt constant it develops slowly through a process we call learning the human brain is limited by the supply of resources the need for rest and overall lifespan an artificial brain on the other hand can live much longer be supplied with constant energy and cooling and extend its capacity over time in terms of compute power and memory the main constraint of existing ai is the absence of a selfreinforcement loop with llms we are trying to solve this with tooling but i believe we will have a technological breakthrough in this area soon the title is clickbait and doesnt align with the content yes the environment and society can stifle intelligence for a while but this is independent of intelligence growth and usually intelligence prevails in the end,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY0lVSEQ0SXh2RHhHdnVCVHExRi1MWlkwOTNZLUoxbl9sM0JyRXpVcW9Ld0VfeGthbmlBSWlJY2FJbklRZEVRd0xuclh0SExOdV9Nei1vRkE0cWxVX0E9PQ==

i know of rices theorem and syntax vs semantics but i cant help but feel there is a more intuitive explanation i think of an algorithm as defining the dynamics of a function rather than the direct mapping from input to output the halting problem being undecidable implies there exist algorithms with properties that cannot be determined exactly without actually running them first in other words the function cannot be compressed any further in spacetime as if you compress in time the increase in space is even greater when it comes to agi ie an algorithm operating in spacetime its clear that it cannot perfectly model the environment data no free lunch right however in practice the compression error will keep decreasing as the agi improves until its smart enough to almost be exact it comes down to the complexity of the data that is being modeled which will bound just how smart this agi can get as long as we agree human intelligence is far from the most efficient compressor of such data there is lots of room for agi to surpass us,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNWNpMXJQaGFjNzRrbW93SmpmcE41RUdDWDM2VXRyQVFwNGpfNXhCWUJWalhwTFBtZWJwLXh3VmNMRDI5X2dlMm9YMlR5UV94MlpZS2ZaeWhyOUpocUE9PQ==

i think the gap between theoretical math philosophy and large language models is far too great to apply the formers thought patterns to the latter without clear concise reason its easy to reference godel to argue intelligence will be limited its much more difficult to pinpoint exactly where that limit occurs and whether or not that is already in the territory of agi i generally believe a biological neural network approach to modelling agi a la kurzweil is much more relevant to understanding the path forward to agi in biological neural nets we actually see scaling laws apply quite neatly across the spectrum of mammalian neocortex complexity,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWZhNVBNWHIxem1DZzl3ODM5Z3RwR2NkTVJfOUs1M1J0aHdjc0k4UkpVNDJrRnhHOVJSaGprYjYzX2VUaGVRbTRPRWh4LWEwcWFOS1NjTWlXZE5WRGc9PQ==

rice theorem doesnt care if the analyzed program is run or not one runs into the halting problem when one attempts to analyze the program by running it you also assume that a trendy compression current lm architectures for example can even manage to explain the data with the least number of bits to archive maximal compression this isnt the case in practice i am doubtful that we will ever find a compression scheme which can do this anyways knowledge isnt what makes a ai agi intelligent compression only works on knowledge the ai still has to use that knowledge to improve itself then it needs to check if the change is a improvement here the rice theorem kicks in there is no way around it thus the ai cant get smarter it can only learn more stuff just like humans you assume that intelligence is only compression i dont even think that humans are intelligent because they compress information i dont buy into hutter and others framing of intelligence as compression sure the human cortex also does something which might get framed as compression but its not the only thing a brain is doing more is necessary about the level of human intelligence vs some hypothetical superhuman level of intelligence i do hold the belief that the level of intelligence which isnt related to what the agent knows as i have explained before of humans is close to the upper ceiling of practically reachable level of hypothetical superintelligence its like turing completeness to me we do have a lot of cognitive flexibility independent on knowledge from birth we are free to combine some sort of building blocks there is no such thing as superturing completeness at some point everything possible can be done by a set of building blocks adding new building blocks doesnt add anything because the new building blocks resemble existing ones its like with legos one doesnt need at some point new shapes to build something with a shape by combining existing shapes,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTnp4dFV3SDZPRmlDNUpSY1VjVF9WUTNUaDVUVWh4Y3luUnpXdEZDZGt3LUtRNWllS3pzNmJEWTF1V2ZQZkVSM1pKYmlvY2NMSjlTWi1vYWt2QUpjUnc9PQ==

the arguments you are making are very human centered theres no reason to expect that agiasi must follow the same limits or mechanisms as biological systems the only environmental impact is that of the data and how it is presented and scored theres no evolutionary pressure because these systems do not have to worry about natural selection thats probably a good thing if they somehow start caring about being shut off then were in trouble and its completely false that individual intelligence wont scale its not about size but emergent behavior think about conways game of life individual cells have a small amount of intelligence in their state transitions but when you combine them you can produce clusters with incredibly complex behavior even turing complete computers in that analogy the network neuron vvdot > act would be the gol cell as it is now we could claim that gpt is smarter than every openai employee because of the sheer breadth of knowledge it possesses you would have to move the goalpost to specific subfields which it was not explicitly trained for to make an argument otherwise that said you had brought up the point of computational irreducibility which i think is valid so far as how we currently use llms at the moment a llm computes in inconstant time input > forward> output which means that the set of all problems they can compute must also be computable in constant time or bounded nonconstant time such that they can be computed within the models depth when you string together multiple forward passes eg agentic llms you break that requirement so long as the nc problem can be broken down into simpler steps which are computable by the llm in tc there may be problems that cannot be broken down like that but then humans cant compute them either out brains also must compute more complex problems in smaller tc steps there is however one big difference between a biological system and agentic llms which is continual learning currently there is no way for llms to efficiently learn new implicit knowledge only access explicit knowledge through the input context whether this can be solved through external augmentation or through a yet unknown internal weight update mechanism is yet to be determined,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXlMczZZMk9waUpsMXpLaGhZRGlLNGgyay1FWXJVejd2WUl2bHgwUlhrdGhkcWFFQnN2UVlOZlJ5X1VGTWprUTE1Q2hUQnRfOXV5enNtOXRWMzZrcUE9PQ==

thanks for responding i have two counters <number> there was a company that was started by <number> noble laureates and it got shut down within a year or so so putting too many smart people together does not necessarily mean that you will figure out new things think of it like this lets say you have <number> class <number> students they will not suddenly solve quantum maths problems or abstract maths even if i increase the number of students thus even if i put <number> einsteins they are more likely to have similar levels of intelligence as a group <number> intelligence alone cant solve all the challenges because of the inherent randomness of the universe ideas and interaction there is abook called why greatness cant be planned by kenneth stanley its a wonderful book and it says that in order to discover new things we need to discover stepping stones what are these stepping stones these are discoveries that were totally unrelated to the discovery you are making for instance in order to discover computers we had to discover vacuum tubes <number> years ago but when vacuum tubes were discovered no one even thought of computing this is true for all major discoveries this is true for a lot of big inventions and discoveries think this through even during species evolution there are things that just happened and thats why we developed certain capabilities out of accidents if you take two amoebae and try to simulate evolution to make it into a human after billions of generations most likely it wont turn into a human please read the book mentioned above its one of my favorite books and it clearly explains that you cant get big results if you purposefully seek them only novelty search leads to interesting discoveries and that will be true for even ai and the search space for even ai will be limitless and a third nontechnical point is that a democratic society doesnt let these systems evolve because eventually they need to be created to serve all humans so what basically happens is with a lot of intelligence you will see a lot of truth and wont engage in social behaviors and the motivation for a technological system will be always derived from a social point of view we dont do science just for science we do it to serve a bigger population if a very smart ai has no application no one will fund it imagine an ai trained to give very highlevel abstract answers but if it doesnt cater to the lies of the masses it will never go forward no one will invest in it i hope you understand thanks,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZEx4LUwyVHNrNWZVRjlhYVVnTDExWWwwSl9MS0R1YVlKQjZoSlpjQlpxY2wzeHZFYXNDUmExUU9Ma29Wc2xYTjNMaHMzZDYzN2RTWmF3TmxuYWQ4TV9Mb1lWeE5EU1QzbDVLU3F0QU9GVU09

as someone else stated earlier these are mostly philosophical but nonetheless intriguing so thank you for sharing critiques as follows > the environment bounds intelligence your argument here seems predicated on two events <number> some high intelligence individuals dont realize their true potential bc of environmental factors <number> others are born too early to have the resources to capitalize on their potential both of those are wrong place wrong times arguments counterpoints already we see that a material share of energy mind share and matter are being directed to scaling machine intelligence so i dont think <number> holds <number> ignores the great scientific potential we already have today and also ignores that we continue to advance our potential and machine intelligence is almost certain to help here too > intelligence is cultural this one is harder to follow specifically the summary doesnt really agree with the other preceding statements youre correct that human intelligence is cultural but we shouldnt anthropomorphize intelligence > intelligence wont scale this one seems to state that if super intelligence were possible then the billions of other humans minds would have already found it this is simply not true certainly humans have dreamt of non biological intelligence but scientifically a lot needed to come together for the potential to exist as it does today chinchilla scaling laws would be a good counter point here we are no where close to exhausting out of distribution tokens on the open internet,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdmxNTTRVSGk4ZEo0NjdhWWlJREo3LW83cnVjTTBXRHMyRFgtc2s5NjZuNXBnNUVvaHpPTVNpRTUzX2Z6dDJjMlplemlyV3BueGZMM041eWRXdXVzVEE9PQ==
