i mean its summarised pretty well in that statement people are used to using chat gpt and the way it interfaces i submit a request it delivers the way bardgemini works is a lot more discreet i see it automagically making calendar invites for people ive emailed its cool but i also want the overt option to explore its functionality in the open rather than its behind the scenes magic,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdURpYlhRLVBvRTNnckV5M1Z5ZkoyTVQwc0x6NFpMamljaDBvek05SXVYZUNTYXphdnNEX2NranJXSzFSNEJvZTl0Y181Ym0xU2lBUld2cmozNzcydWM1a0hPQkhBOWxUNDIyWWJKNUtKSkE9

yeah i think its tough to find this balance i think the idea initially was to offer a more capable version of google assistant as a way to differentiate itself from competitors like chatgpt but if it doesnt work well people wont like it and if its just the same ui as chatgpt people will prefer to use that instead,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTLXBIMDFsanRMbGhyeHUxNW50QzlNYTkya3QxY19GZHktTHRVZjJVUE9abmxHYVBQX05EZko4ZjhfUkVXdV92dHZjRUV4QldJZjFfa1R0bklrOG9pVUE9PQ==

i think the functionality makes a lot of sense my reasons for deletion were more superficial i didnt like the male voice that i couldnt change so i went back to assistant because i like her high pitched voice and british accent also the fact that you have to choose between the two seems rather lazy on googles part it seems like the assistant functions cant be accessed by two different models so they decided to just give you gemini vs assistant,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQ1RXbGZOVnY2ZXQtT0FpRkZNUFNaanFNWW84M1ZlZDhaR3J3eUw1dmgwOEZMOGhLYTZnMlBoLTEwRzk0dmxGVV82MGxPQlJad3BvUjRUUks3ZThJb1E9PQ==

in the movie we are told that mining the comet might create a utopia without poverty or disease the catch is it could very well could destroy life on earth in his recent hard fork interview demis hasabis says the invention of artificial superintelligence might create a utopia including mining comets and ending poverty or disease the catch is it has a nonzero risk his words of destroying life on earth so you tell me whats farfetched,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTY3ZpOHpGOVFUMmV6UXF3U3lBdUFBUTYxVDZCVjN2bkl3QjJwdTVsT2xOa21yTGpEcmJpbkZMYkdnR2QwZmU3VFQtaTd0clcyaW1XNTRNSmo1Y3l4aEE9PQ==
proportionality <number> is nonzero extremely unlikely is nonzero these guys are super precise in their wording the movie presents the mining of the asteroid as a completely foolish and reckless endeavour with upsides that will most likely get captured by elites the poster is just assuming the magnitude of risk and reward of asteroid vs ai are functionally the same thats absolutely not a given and this post is just assuming they are and especially then suggesting demis is naive lmao hes a literal genius of course hes given this incredible amounts of thought,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOHdmSF9pVUJuQWc4WHdLazBoX0dCMmw0MHJ6Y0ZIclZZdmdzMDBfLWlpM3E0Skp4Slg2ZjB4ckJZelp5dzJENlhHWnlzOHRyampSc0ZlcURaVlR2eUE9PQ==

who made demis hassabis the ultimate authority on the risk presented by artificial superintelligence i havent heard him disclose a concrete percentage other than that its nonzero and his endorsement of the statement mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war geoffrey hinton has gone on record with putting the probability of such a catastrophe at <number> chance in the next <number> years others are higher or lower depending on the individual no one in the movie aside from a small group of scientists is willing to accept the actual risk of the comet to the viewer its obvious but you cant see it when youre in the world of dont look up >the movie presents the mining of the asteroid as a completely foolish and reckless endeavour with upsides that will most likely get captured by elites > >and especially then suggesting demis is naive lmao hes a literal genius yes isnt that what makes the clip so absurd,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVTJjZGNtaGM0Vm92ZGY2dFljOFJEajhhTWtGdmtacVV2c0U4NURlM3B4aTNsT2piV3ZiX0FoRE9HSHNsTWNZZzBSVm1XX2RWRWx4eENoaWhPRVlBY2c9PQ==
because its a pretty apt comparison heres what i said to the other guy in the movie we are told that mining the comet might create a utopia without poverty or disease the catch is it could very well could destroy life on earth in his recent hard fork interview demis hasabis says the invention of artificial superintelligence might create a utopia including mining comets and ending poverty or disease the catch is it has a nonzero risk his words of destroying life on earth,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZGtxMGRqN0lUS3VHLU9NQVRsWUFpMVNqVkFRWGtxbTdEMS1CM1Q3aTRXWTVnekx5cmt0Z1dlTFZUQWdXSldMVWtLWkhFYlE5cDdtZWdnbUZldlI5Qmc9PQ==
you certainly arent the first to make the comparison and truth be told its certainly not dissimilar to the events of the movie i suppose in the end i trust hassabis has thought through this far more than what transpired in the movie where quarterly profit returns overrode common sense whereas hassabis has probably angsted heavily about this field and how quickly its moving and is fully aware of how momentarily stupid hell look if it goes wrong whether it will have a different outcome is the problem at least in this situation i feel it wont end life on earth or even be a negative event and well look back on our angst as typical human survivalistic pessimism but i do not blame anyone ever for thinking that its like stopping a mission to halt a comet about to smack earths shit because think of the potential utopia most of the people offended by that insinuation tend to be singularitarians who lost sight of the dangers,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZXFsM0lkZTBMMGN6eGMxWWJibDEtSmNSalBxT0lkT0Q3R2tndGx4MnFPa3pQMFF5SjF6bEFhV1IwVlJ6am9GdFdqdlFQLUVWN0pCdkkyOW0yVkgwT0E9PQ==

while this is a reasonable take i think what i find so disagreeable about your perspective is the idea i trust hassabis has thought through this he seems like a smart guy but i never agreed to put my life or the life of my loved ones in his hands who gave him the authority it is reckless to continue developing capabilities knowing how serious and real the risks are,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTU2txMnhUbGM0R2lHcHBBdDdaa25IMWV0bVNPbWQycHVCMXFDMEQ1alNtdEtScm00MGtrY01oX194dl92aTl4d05wV0ZuRC1vdTllX19pSmk1TkR6Y3c9PQ==
devils advocate do remember as recently as a few years ago he did not think that agi was imminent even in <number> he was saying that artificial general intelligence was more than ten years away and probably more than that he didnt sign up to be that authority he was of the mind that there was going to be a lot more time than there actually wound up being and that by the time we would get even reasonably close there would be ample time for debates about how to proceed openai screwed that up by exploiting scaling laws and large language models which was an unexpected path to the world models necessary to form the foundation for at least an early agi think of the controversies about data scraping copyrighted material that was also openai google and deepmind werent pursuing that approach hassabis and his team were of the mind that a magical algorithm for intelligence would bootstrap us to agi but that algorithm was not known and even if we did know it thered still be too much work to reasonably accomplish it in the s singularitarians hoped that maybe by the early s itd be here but it was most probably not intended to be on deepminds game plan for <number> years even as late as <number> deepmind could comfortably ignore what openai was doing right up until chatgpt was released and made it very public how far ahead they were because before chatgpt openai wasnt much different from how we view any other tech startup or something like mcdonalds ai lab maybe they have some nifty demonstrations and a novel idea or two but the real leaders are deepmind and their rivals at baidu but then they threw down the gauntlet and said we are a leap away from agi deepminds approach seems to be a much more thoughtout and technically skilled one at that so if they do take the lead id still trust them to handle the alignment problem more than any subsidiary of microsoft but going back to what youre saying i dont think they expected that theyd have to lead like this at all this soon if you want to blame anyone blame openai and the fact there was no attempt at a topdown regulation of efforts most likely because now that chinas aware to the game there straight up cannot be one thats the part i relate to dont look up more than anything,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUzZUM1kyTG5CTGlhR3VrZ1EzMVB3bnVOMGg0TnV4c1FSVy0zOTB3NlFrUFoyUkVXT1ZqaUtoZ0pJdDJFZGxpZUpUb2J1eTBzXy0taXJpeUtXZWcxT0E9PQ==

these are wellthought out positions do you work in the ml field a google employee perhaps all that history may be true but people have choices if youre on the wrong road you can still turn back geoffrey hinton did and so did yoshua bengio by continuing on the present path lets be clear that demmis and co are deciding to advance capabilities additionally i recognize the race dynamics are difficult similar to a societal problem like global warming however what i find so disagreeable about your take is that youre effectively positioning demmis hasabis and leading labs that arent openai as moderates saying they are moderates because they entertain ai existential risk issues is just frame control and completely irresponsible you would never enter a plane that had a <number> chance of crashing likewise if you are working on a project which you believe has a <number> chance of ending the world in the next <number> years geoffrey hintons latest pdoom that is reckless and needs to be stopped i do think some of the safety work done at the labs is good ie mechanistic interpretability the supersafety team that openai is starting the safety research thats likely happening under the auspices of deepmind just look at what geoffrey hinton yoshua bengio and max tegmark and so on are doing they are calling for regulation to minimize the existential risk all across the world that is what someone in industry should be doing the folks at the leading ai labs have twisted their minds around a logic like yours that somehow accelerating this tech helps the cause what theyre doing is simply not okay theyre gambling with the lives of us and loved ones it should be illegal,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMGJHZFBQWHJYNlY4Zk1VaUVtaEVWSFdLb0IwTldxbEctSk92NWxuUHVNVU93OG5JenRRbm1VdVdkNDZvampyWURnUUVzWTdvcGhwSkotTEhjVXVkNFE9PQ==

again youre assuming it to be obvious that the risk is large when i go somewhere mitigating the risk of death from getting run over by a car should be my highest priority alongside other potentially lethal risks such as getting mugged or cycling into something from this statement you would be concluding that i should never go out because my fucking life could end thats the worst possible outcome but actually no its still worth going out because the chance isnt that large and the rewards are worth it but i should still be super vigilant while out in traffic what you could have done is start a conversation about the odds of these existential risks instead of just assuming theyre obviously way too big and that daddy demis is naive,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQnByNnVFU1I5a01DWWdienhyazlPSHk2czh6MWtsQy1ab2hjdE1uTElkdWkxOG1Rd295ZUdXWUdYVTNLZmU0NldqVlUwS2dTbHptNTh2bWEzUkVxN0E9PQ==

thats consistent with numbers ive seen from some other ml researchers and philosophers interested in artificial intelligence it turns out that giving agents massive capabilities is dangerous you cant control it and probably dont fully understand it predicting the future is hard or course and so those numbers should all be taken lightly but the possibility itself cant be readily dismissed it doesnt matter at all if these agents are sentient or conscious or aware a smart bomb can blow you up even though it doesnt appreciate jazz gpt<number> may choose to hack into a nuclear launch system without ever having contemplated its place in the world so it goes,r/deepmind,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOV9JWXdJSjdtcXJXQjhUVjNZMjNBQ0QweHBwWEpLa25rRkdoMWtZWmZITDZPalFVdEp1VkVJTVZOd0M3dXZtZnNjeEtQNGt2Zm16MnZlSDcwQWt4UUE9PQ==
