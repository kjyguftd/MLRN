> in the rulebook discussing builds during the build phase is forbidden after autumn is adjudicated everyone silently writes down their build and play moves on you discuss your builds during the springfall negotiations if i get one supply center i buildif i get two supply centers then i build likewise with retreats harder to know if youll need one ahead of time but you can discuss what your retreat should be should you have one,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcFhNSkFkSHFiTHhVVUJ1M0JmR1dkN2FPSGlwTlZlaW1uRks1YkM4VnoyQ083M0NxT2lqV3dXV0ZoV2tIVTY1NXBZbzRVaUw2QlhENTY0VURZNGZtVEE9PQ==

may help to think about what youd do if you were turkey since thats really what youre responding to if im turkey arm is attacking sev nothing else for it to do might as well cut that support not supporting this with bla because i expect mos to support sev i could try for an attack on rum by bul supported by bla and ser but i wouldnt expect that to work either gal probably supports rum and someone else probably attacks ser and cuts support but what i can do with bla is attack rum to cut its support for anything then if bul supports ser ser is safe from anything but an attack from rum which is unlikely and risky given how many turkish units can attack rum that lets me maneuver my fleets with alb going to adr and gre going to alb for a better shot in the following season thats not the only thing your turkey can do especially if theyre afraid someone will move into ion and want to keep a fleet in gre but its both safe and the most likely way they can eventually crack you on this front given that you can otherwise hold out against them indefinitely if you play conservatively so its what they ought to try to do barring other concerns,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcFN0Q180TUV1WVowci1PRkczWmFnQkw5ZnpyRjdzNEdwWXhqb0JRR1Z2ajFVVmRNUmtoREdJNVBkRmxQYlJEUkI4cmZMVFIyakI2a0RBNlV5cW1vdnc9PQ==

worried about turkey has three builds at your expense if they want them use this and their sc lead to demand they support you into lvp and tell them if they touch a single french supply center youre moving out of the rest of yours so england can take them you really let fear of a common enemy overcome the caution needed to leave a couple of rearguard units against the stab but weve all done it turkeys one unit behind the line wont be of much effect because its alone unless it works in perfect harmony with france i dont see turkey being able to stab their way to <number> here even with the scottish turk threeway draw is most likely outcome unless england takes mos or helps a take it then snatches it back when a crumbles and blitzes fs homeiberiangerman scs,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQMXlFVldpYy1MMGV3clhQTkYzNG11ZjVaVlBaRE85cDJncXQwSUZMQWlIZVphQnhRQzhLb2EycFYxejZWY0oyQnVISHpySHMwczRhTG5FN0loMncxX3c9PQ==

sort of a suicidal all out attack <url><url> it got me bulgaria and due to the awkward position of his fleets in turkey he wasnt able to defend himself well also i got germany to join my side so russia was losing warsaw and sweden i was then able to negotiate a temporary ceasefire with russia while i finished off italy and take spain hurting france enough to break the <number> year long stalemate he and england had and win england over to my side after that i turned my attention back to russia i trapped his fleets in the med by blocking him out of const and went straight for his home supply centers basically closing the gates behind him as he was sailing out this was the point when he decided to quit cursing me for ruining a perfect alliance i decided to offer him a draw since i felt bad although we had equal supply centers and i was in a much better position to press the attack especially since i had germany and england on my side heres the final board position <url><url> it was one of the craziest games i ever played,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQb00yNVVZcFlDazlaVDRIdkpMVExmb0pSUFVlYzhVYjhlN3pURHZvXzd0WG5jd1Q2THNqdXVqUlQ4NVhxSXRGbjBMaHl3RWYtRjJVVG9mMkVwZ21QbHc9PQ==

my strategy of just bombing out every common opening move i could think of worked fairly well lol only one in the top <number> i missed was wargal <number> >piemar< is really on this list huh i also wondered whether this included convoys surely yorbelyornwy has got to be up there,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNReXZIdTFoYzFTRHoxWGZPdGtON1pqUENCSnV5bndWQy1PMzZxbzJheFUtckhMM0kyWDNhcHlURk9pUWtIMkRlbWhQR2s2cThDT256Y3FpcHdvS1psVnc9PQ==
>armsev< is likely present because >every army built in turkey that isnt travelling via convoy has to either go via bul or sev in a lategame where turkey is doing well theyll be trying to push lots of units out to the frontline so many will come through arm< i was very surprised by >piemar< too though,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRQ01VTHd2Q3FfSktLcnFkQjdnWnhvbnYtMjBQNGlHaTJOZ2JQM0tEd19rZjlCX3FaNElWRVV0MWZVZWh3OEZoelJhMWV5T0NrRWlCeXc1dFVubGlmd2c9PQ==

convoys are rare enough that none are anywhere close to the top <number> the most common convoy is edinwy which is roughly the th most common move overall,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRR3RWSFI1N1JKUTFKQlBSRG1YNUNYTlB6Vmpqd1FZQm81ZDlwRUM5VUtEY0VXclFxSURuanUtQUN5aWw2TVpMeGtXVDZFN0YtS3hfQnhsaFRaMzl6YWc9PQ==
yep that goes in two directions stpbot is actually not a very common move outside of the first turn because stp sc is a relatively uncommon build if youre going antigermany as russia youll be wanting more armies than fleets and if youre going anywhere else in the north f stp nc or a stp are going to be more useful so stpbot is usually played exactly once per game and the top <number> average much higher than that >piemar< did surprise me but i think the reason is that >if italy attacks france they tend enter that order repeatedly trying to get through the army chokepoint<,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRRkpqWXRuOGlESFJwLUNaM2FqTWVTWVFnMGtndnBlWWNXcEM3SUdKYk5GQ2lXQU01VUtUQUxfUGNia0JhTjJJejBUM2xNXzhEWWRnU0U5SzFzQlVvQ2c9PQ==

from just a glance i think you have a choice between saving the army in berlin and holding denmark bermun with support from kie ruh and bur will guaranteed work but youll get dislodged in denmark which obviously isnt ideal theres a chance germany may use bal to guarantee they get into ber but i wouldnt count on it im assuming italy is also helping germany into munich ideal situation is you defend den and get into mun but if germany and italy are coordinating youre probably losing the army have you tried speaking to russia rum is free for the taking and could cause enough chaos to let you slip back into berlin in the future,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRYXJHSmFCOXdTaTQ5SmRhNm1MX29Wc2pKX0lqQXFFSzFWNXN4VW8wNlpTalFBRHo5QnVnemlaNUtWZ3hoLUJUcVVJaXlxZlMwRXJ5ZHdtaTQ5eENsS2c9PQ==
not realistically you face a line of <number> units with <number> if germany supports with f baltic you could tap them but that makes you vulnerable to <number> fleet attack on denmark likewise if germany and italy want to force themselves into munich thats <number> of their units and you can bring <number> units of support yourself unless prussia doesnt tap berlin for some reason you could support berlin into munich and guarantee success but the turn after that you will be pushed back again,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRTkgyM2k0b1IySzBUQVliRnV4bGFSVlp4TDl5VXpzdzRRUGdqN25xTlJ2TzFRUzJzekZFRWNJb193STYzUl93Q3BwZDVqZWJwSTU2eVNlRUdyRmJvZGc9PQ==
if the sole goal is not being forced to disband yes bur and ruh can support ber to mun and that will almost certainly keep the army over there likely in mun rather than forced disbanding if the goal is saving ber the supply center theres nothing foolproof germany can guarantee it by supporting bal into ber with sil and boh nothing you can do to prevent that likewise if bal attacks kie to cut support and one army supports the other to ber if theyre silly enough to try to support an army in with both bal and the other army you could hold onto ber by supporting it with kie and having den attack bal to cut support however that risks the nightmare outcome where you lose ber and den without getting swe if bal is supported into ber your den fleet ends up in bal and an attack on den from ska then takes den i dont really have a good play for you the position is tenuous the good news is theyre not even going to have anywhere open to build but to finish them youve got to find a way to bring more fleets to bear without letting italy into mao or iberiamarseilles and thats going to be a tall order youve had a nice game so far but italy has no real opposition and is about to roll barring a major shift in dynamics germany doesnt have the armies to stop it on land and youre going to have trouble getting fleets in position to stop them at sea with no sense of the dynamics and betrayals and burned bridges and just looking at the map germany and you would be best served holding the main stalemate line together and ensuring a threeway with italy then when italy eats germanys southern centers maybe you cut out germany in the north and make that a twoway with italy if you can and depending on seriousness of the game and relationships,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRWllLZDF4Vk5rNk1fa2VadzN2dVpoYmw4T0dJcDU5MnNfVkFnUmwyZEtfVk5JQURSRng0MkpfSHQwaVRWNU1GYmZhYjFOQVBlcFVQQVdNdzhHcF90b3c9PQ==
ive played in dip tournaments since the mid s with breaks get your tactics down pat know where the majority and minority stalemate lines are this will help you determine strategy but only so far as your potential allies and enemies will let you openings are flexible depending on your reading of the opening round negotiations for instance when i play england i really prefer to secure the northern seven centers which can be coincidentally a stalemate position if germany removes the fleet edi lon lvp nwy swe den stp i am inclined to open to nwg nth and ediyor however if russia comes hard with a proposal to take down germany or if italy and germany come hard with an antifrench proposal and russia agrees not to commit northward i might adjust and open to the channel to attack france so openings are contingent just know where you need to get to from a tactical perspective but let the strategy ie your negotiations lead the way learn how to read board position dont be overreliant on your allysallies reassurances make sure they cannot threaten you if they can take advantage they probably will thats part of the game the board position will perhaps tell you more about whats to come than what people will tell you finally and more importantly know how to quickly and accurately write consistent orders misorders are a definite thing and ive seen them take players completely out of the tournament as happened just this summer at the origins tournament in columbus oh dont let a misorder ruin your plans if you want practice in writing orders there is no better place to play than at <url><url> as this site forces you to type in unit orders instead of using a ui to generate them it is super helpful for building consistency in order writing,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXS1AtSENPWFJkanBiNzI1SzlKZTRfbnFXUFYwT2VYNi1EUlI1N0lHbjc0SnZlYlUzdmZLRzZrMThYSkMxS0xUMUlJU0U3WDU5SUE3S0ItclFmQWt6SkE9PQ==
realistically hes not attacking den with support if he does you retreat to swe and hes net neutral so hes focused on ber and mun mun is attacked with support from tyr the guessing game is around ber the only fool proof way for him to attack is to attack by fleet with support from his armies that of course largely hobs him of future attacks into germany and its questionable how worth it that is the safe play is to retreat to mun and make a play for swe while guarding den it causes enough chaos and buys you time elsewhere if youre ballsy try and attack his fleet but as others have said the downside is you could lose both units but overall you need to wrap up england thats the priority take england and use it to free up fleets and convoy armies around germany edit alternatively he could be using ska as a trick here ska could be making a move to swe to cover his open centers then attacking ber with his fleet in that case move an army to den fleet to bal move ber to mun with support youll lose a unit but also set yourself up nice to gain next season,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNW1DNTM2ZnNLWGdtY2tiWUJIZjFELUxndWtidkRWVWc0alkyLVo3MkthS3c0UWJjLXgxOWgtQjI2LXNGY1lmV194Z3R2dE5tYi1DN3Baa3pFVGhmZHc9PQ==
the boston massacre is a great diplomacy tournament i think youll have a great time my suggestions are pretty simple <number> show the other players you are reliable understand the basic game mechanics and can write good orders in face to face tournament play negotiation time is extremely valuable consider time a currency if you can prove that you can write orders and understand basic tactics like when a support will be cut the experienced players will be more willing to spend their negotiation time working with you you dont need to impress anyone with fancy tactics or grand strategy just prove you understand the fundamentals of the game <number> you will be at a disadvantage because you do not have past history with the tournament players at most tournaments you have two crowds the locals who probably play together a few times a year and the travelers who also probably play each other a few times a year at various tournaments across the globe i love asking players if they have any history with the other players and who to watch out for you can learn a ton about the human side of this game with this simple question if someone is chatty ask them if they can characterize the play style of the people they have played with not everyone is willing to spend their negotiation time answering this but if someone is willing to share it can at least give you a head start on understanding what to watch out for <number> you will be at an advantage because you do not have past history with the tournament players while it absolutely a disadvantage to have no experience playing with the other players its also an advantage because you dont have baggage we all claim not to remember past games and for some of us thats generally true but we do tend to remember specific times where someone screwed us over or have opinions about if we are likely to work well with another player or not as a new player you are a blank slate you can build your own reputation and wont have to worry about someone being mad at you for something you did five years ago during a game you cant remember anything about but they can give you a turn by turn recap of what a horrible person you are not that i know anything about that since i am an alliance player who is a great ally to everyone  <number> be prepared for the games to feel fast this is particularly true if you havent played facetoface but is even true if you have played facetoface but not in a tournament setting there is never enough time time is a major currency watch out for people intentionally trying to waste your time preventing you from negotiating with others dont go into negotiations until you have written the starting location of each unit take one minute to review the board and compose your thoughts if possible try to have a plan on what you would like to see happen before negotiating you can always adjust your plans based on negotiations but taking this time for yourself can help slow the speed of the game and reduce the odds someone will sweet talk you into something that is bad for you <number> have fun there are two things i love about tournaments first the quality of play will likely be higher than most other environments its rare to find people as passionate about the game of diplomacy outside of a tournament environment second the community is amazing while there are occasional bad apples the diplomacy community has been one of the best i have had the chance to be a part of they tend to be extremely intelligent are often more social than many other gaming communities due to the nature of the game requiring negotiation and come from a wide variety of backgrounds take the time to get to know people outside the game table diplomacy players love talking about themselves go out for a drink or food between games get someone talking about their favorite opening and then transition into what they do for work what their other hobbies are etc for the most part people are quite welcoming and if you ever dont feel comfortable just excuse yourself and move to another table there are far more amazing people in this hobby than not youll be amazed at who you can meet i hope you enjoy the diplomacy tournament community as much as i do even if its just half as much youre in for a great time ,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXcUpFVHR3SFB2ODc3a3BtUVZDRWVPaURxMFp1dXVPRHdoemhqU05hYjQ2YTlfckZGSHl6b0FNUEhpZWJnN2VBX1ZHWnFFb2NRUlpST3ZoNG9pOUVCeHc9PQ==

welcome to the ff tournament scene its amazing my main advice would be to have fun legit thats it most people dont win tournaments and some people are guaranteed to do badly the joy of a diplomacy tournament is the people i mean if we didnt like people wed play chess right dont over think things accept the fact youll get sucked in to a game and do stuff you would never do online if you have a good time getting to know great people it wont matter if you do well or not now if you really want to do well i have one piece of advice have fun with fast paced in person games who is fun to work with is often the deciding factor in an alliance if youre an enjoyable person to play with and youre clearly enjoying yourself that will become infectious and will bode well for your chances if youre stressed and too tense people will attack you because of bad vibes dont worry about preparing tactics or strategies if you walk in to a game with plans youll get stuck in those plans and wont be able to adapt to the most critical part of the game the personalities enjoy yourself and revel in how amazing a weekend of your favourite board game with great people can be,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXS1lGcWJuSXNERXV3RnZMbUd5ZWUtdkNDWl85aDNJYlZvLVlGWEZ5ZzBod0UzcmJpRTYzYnl2blZ2bWVQaUZhYWZadFlJTHVPWm9qcGg4ejlwaWpaWkE9PQ==

one thing i didnt understand going into tournaments that is totally different from casual playthe tournament scoring system usually means players are trying to survive instead of win many are unwilling to take risks i played three different tournament games where we never really got beyond the initial spaces or maybe austria was eliminated and then we saw a few pieces traded around for the rest of the game winning the round is not always important in a tournament is what im saying,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNjM2dnR4bXdqTllKWW1CQUVjeGtZOExtZHppUl9KVzc5X1JoeU0tNVJjV1lqb2c5RHRtd0ZUejhHUUM1UTRvZ3RZbWY3MURSMU1ud0ZfdnUxQ21UUFE9PQ==

i have a very simple rule only build if you absolutely have to my advice would be to waive as much as possible sounds like a joke but it isnt a build is the most committal move you can make in diplomacy why would you commit unless you really need it most often people build stuff then it sits behind their lines doing nothing better to have that build in pocket and you can put down what you really need when you need it,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRVdhb0FzSDVoVGlBWFphUmZEc3NEeWZOVUNBTjRLSTFVbEE5YzJtQm9pX1hrSzF4YndHRG4yazg2RmdTVW1IN0RmaWdxY1FuOEphdUZFc09YeWlFWmc9PQ==

i think the classic map is almost perfect but for variants id like experiments with multiple unit types for instance for a medieval setting it could make sense to rename armies to infantry and to add an extra unit type called cavalry which is weaker than infantry and perhaps cannot capture centers but has more movement options,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU2FURGR5aDYzMlZzWEJwazhINlM3NnhmbklVT2hrR21hTDNDaUZtakh3MncwUl94OG5vTWI0bFNPLXRRcC1iYmIxT2FCMXF1MlZXTXVlSVR4dVZJV3c9PQ==
cavalry and artillery would fit well with the time period im just not sure how youd go about modifying the rules to incorporate them without damaging things too much or being ridiculous cavalry moving <number> spaces a turn is right out at the scale of the map and artillery having a range of <number> has a similar problem artillery offering <number> support but not being able to capture or something,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNXNneE9nZ0ZpNUNiVXc2cS1qYWRxWkxBODRtUWN5SEt2STI4aGczNFAzQWRVdTY5clkzd0Q0cXpFYVMzRmJsZnJiX1MzZkJWN0duczhHQnVEcFR5aFE9PQ==

hmm you could have scouts yes which can perhaps move faster and support as usual but cannot take centers or cut support if double movement speed is too much perhaps only the spring season should involve scouting for that years campaign and the fall season should not allow extra scout movement id not generically name them cavalry since generally cavalry has been stronger than infantry historically knights were the linchpin of many a medieval european army and even though they knew how to fight on foot or with bow and arrow they were unmatched as heavy shock cavalry on an open field,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOTBYM1Q5d1F2WVBCUmg3azlEcEhpTFEwQTFyaXVnNFBVRWFBdnkwZDNvSEpOTUxOTUw4YnV4Z3QxejRWTlVTWlUtQThvTFVTZUN2X3F3UG14ODhTRUE9PQ==

i dont think its a stalemate because england doesnt control portugal what i would do as austriaitaly is hold mao while working to get an army in spain once that is done austria can get mao fleet into gascony while preventing italy from retaking mao then austria can get another fleet into mao at this point england is tied up defending everything so you can have mars go to gascony gascony back to north coast spain and spain to mars that will give italy two armies in gascony and mars burgundy cannot be held and then eventually the rest of the links of chain start breaking for england edit it would be easier i think if austria went for north coast of spain with mao supported by lyo and moved spain to mao supported by portugal naf and wes then do a convoy into gascony supported by the fleet in spain quicker to pull off regardless i dont think it is a statemate because austriaitaly still have attacking ideas in the west the east is definitely a stalemate though,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad04tYmtHNUFHd0dDSThtLUpYbTI5MWV0YjlLelNwNnZ3Rk01QS1yNmRyUGR4a0RObzRvYjF6dEhtU3FmNGI3YkpTV0gtSEI5WS0ySDRLcmE2LTIxRHc9PQ==

effectively a stalemate austria and italy could slowly make there way through the mao and austria could combine that and turn on italy to grab its final sc however the issue is that italy has zero reason to let austria grow and eventually they would turn on each other and youd likely end up with england and italy working together and this would go on and on and on <number> way draw are super common because the alliances will immediately flip anytime someone gets close to winning meaning you end up with a never ending stalemate till people get bored,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZC1TMHN6VzBkZlJieE55djV5bVRXdEFaWDF2eTIwVTdRaEt6QmlwaFBMWHpRejBOR19pSFdzSldKUHBsXzE5VlZ1c3FDWEkycjhBRTg5eXVPUGdqMHlqTWJRNG0xbkphVXJYUmcwcTRTdEU9

could someone please help me understand the rules here i was playing on webdiplomacy as turkey and was puzzled when the french army in bohemia was allowed to take vienna my fleet in the adriatic was supporting trieste and im confused why this wasnt enough to allow the army in trieste to support the army in vienna i just started playing diplomacy so im sure ive made some beginner mistake here but if someone could help me with why these orders didnt work out and what i could do next time id really appreciate it thanks in advance,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLWdqRlIzX1FRYWJTd0JGSzlYLWk2SjR5SXMxUE54Rnk1Sldtei1SYWljMjBjS2I3LXRZM3ZxMGFCUGo4ZEo0TVBHOWdDeEZaa1l5a0Y2cUxYMy1yd3c9PQ==
looks like the support holds from gal and tri were cut so it was <number> on <number>,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZEh4ak5EZjVqQTJGTHVQcklPYy00cGJGLU1nLU56V1JsUlU3enB3YnhGRENueEkweHBENklNd056WTVVNTF1SEhYUWpXajQ2a3QycVEyUW53cVhWVUE9PQ==
why was the support from tri cut though this is what im trying to understand if tri had support from adr and ven had no support going into tri why couldnt tri support vie if vienna wasnt supporting galicia would this still happen i have a front of <number> vs a front of <number> it feels like i should have been able to hold the line but now im confused about the rules,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNHFSa0oyOUxSV3h1dHFLenlQZkRJa2FIbS1CT3NFY0FFdFotTEpVTXRKRXFZRURySkY3UGV4X2ctQnExc1ZJZUxrWm4yU2dQYlFNM3QwZUV0SVNBRFE9PQ==
my fleet in the adriatic was supporting triesteall this does is support tri to hold which is what youre doing when you issue a support order youre holding in your province supporting another move it doesnt provide any defense against having your support cut you could have had bud ser adr and alb all support tri pretend you had pieces in the open territories and all that would help you with is stopping a supported move from dislodging you out of tri not maintaining tris support of vie one move is enough to disrupt support with the only exception being if the move comes from the territory that an attack is being supported into imagine three units french ven turkish adr tri moves are ven>tri adr >ven tri s adr>ven vens move fails and does not cut tris support because that support is for an attack on ven,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZmo4YTA1ZU1EZFFHc3JLYjV2bmVsNTFnclF2NVBsWVRDeW4zTnk3bENlZ0tBZjN3VUxNRjBpRzAxS2cyNjNpd1RmZ2VtZWtTWVE5Z1FYcTh2MG9tU3c9PQ==
thank you im surprised i got so far without knowing this for some reason i thought one unit supporting a second unit that is also supporting a third unit would negate an attack on the second unit will change play accordingly,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMU1nVDBBazJlYzdTRzFBSmRYZXNNVnltclkwV0lpd1J5SGR6M0hGTGE2RGFnS0VtLVFDSGlsWU41cE9BYS1KbkdGWGZhV3h4M2ZEY2N3dnc0TWs4YlE9PQ==
>if tri had support from adr and ven had no support going into tri why couldnt tri support vie there is no way to support a support a support either succeeds or if it suffers any attack regardless of strength it is cut,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnb3NUQjR4Z3R0RG03REo3MlhZZk5PTURhVVdTMzRLZ1l6VXRFeFRrdkNyLV81TG44aGpCTnVpNkhCbnJPUktwNjJUdHo1QTBKNnMybENCdlpneGdJVVE9PQ==
just to confirm assuming every other moves was the same since one move is enough to disrupt support would i have held position with orders adr>tri tri>tyr vie s tri>tyr thanks again,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYW9BNlF6SjBITVFMZGtReEk0Q01acDkwMHJuUXpBbmdEcklWSUhLcUQ1YjAwaFBjMXc3T3hSaGREdmpZNmJuVy1iRXdzeXQ0OFhmbTFVVzhGdUtOMUE9PQ==

tri would have cut tyrs support and boh would have cut vies support not that you could get through the double support on tyr anyway so the whole thing would have bounced and youd have kept vie,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnU1phQm9pS2FiSVU0ZlVYY05KQnJRSTd0X1VJU04zN2pTTGtqcjNCckVmOWlVeTc3WVJxWlpMQWJqQmJmUE91aW1MVThuQzlMV0x3SjdhNVpERDNTQUE9PQ==
since it hasnt been said yet it looks like france might not know the rules either i dont know the platformsymbols here but it looks like rome and apulia are both supporting venice to hold while venice is moving to trieste to cut support im your situation adriatic s trieste to venice wouldve succeeded as romeapulia cant support a unit to hold if that unit is moving i could be mistaken and it could be something like rome s apulia to venice which wouldve blocked you moving in but it doesnt look like it,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncU9WOXJ4S3lvSjhxRUZBV1JFQmZIOTRuT0E3X3JDdGVZRXUwaWN6cUtlUWlKalVocTZfVlRWRUMwVjRYRGFzbGhUZDJmT0IzUU9DSDdQekpuYzVQanc9PQ==

backstabbr has a sandbox you can make separate of any game they added a feature where you can manually add and subtract units and territory control in like the last year as well,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbV9QNURCYVpJT1AzX2NqektSZV9CUFZwd2dNOGlFLVRick8tRjhtWnRORS1yQmtiNWh4alVHaUhqWXBaSzg3VG1qYTdRMURhX1Z4TXhaMUlneU15ZlE9PQ==
another way to put it would be support orders are nontransitive<url>,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRjRWZnk3R3B5amVpd0lrWk1tVTBxQngwZDNlVWR0UjZYUXJ5SkNPRjljYXRzdGFUbHA4b3ZGa1BYT3QzXzJPZjIzazBZdzBsY3VEZ1RURTB3OXdteEE9PQ==
its a surprisingly common rules misunderstanding that support has to be to move or hold and doesnt apply to the other,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneUg5Vjh4WE5ab09mc0g5SEh4YmF0T1lHTXMtUzF1Q1RldzNxX2hTOFAyZHJyOWZ0em9mQ0FUenV6Wk83VHMtT0p4dVpoSG9xTmN2Y2hzWW9ZS1c2Y2c9PQ==
i seem to mostly get wrecked when i roll russia and im not sure if its me or the game ive heard the theory that its almost subconscious because the map projection makes russia look bigger than it actually is russia by far has the largest area in their territories even though its entirely inconsequential to the game itself,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYWhCeDNoanFUdWktNTNmTEZoWG92UXUyMWhMX3FzRXhqU3lkanFYV2hVXzRmbVlYREwtYVlMNXdGSXpDYkhSZUxRc1pObEQxcWhLV2Y5WWF3OWpFMlE9PQ==
this plus the extra unit at the beginning definitely make people more likely to perceive russia as having a dominant position a <number> centers russia is just doing ok while a <number> center england or turkey is poised to sweep but people often dont realize that with the number of neighbors it has russia is also effectively a central power and not a corner one,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZzNZVVNBV3lxcUswRnNiRUJVcE9WbkZRdTBMckhCY1lWNUJTaDFQWXA0dDRNbVdXdlhLYUVJYi01UHBES2tWM052SEJ2TDd1WFVPaXV5VmVyZ2k3T3c9PQ==

stats say russi in theory i would say that in a game that is so balanced having one extra unit is meaningful anecdotally i would say that russia steamrolls or dies but it does enough of the former that when you look at stats it comes up trumps,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTmFuN1RIT1lYN1pQeUwxTUhaLWVUaXZnV2UyLTJWVW5aUDFhTzFHVDIzMngyU29XOFA5SHpuWmFUVUZhNHc0Zi1fMVVhSXByTHNLT0lpWVhTSzRZLXJTN3hJNXNLcm5adDBkUzZQRnF1NDQ9
