disinformation isnt one sideism that concept is being ignored in ukraine that said its not like the reasons are good enough for the invasion but there are reasons than putin is hitler and its likely the goal is on some level the dissolution of the western rules based system unlike might is right that is the underlying cause even if unstated annexation of crimea the georgia invasion or using a different country chinese maritime blue water navy provocations and punishment towards countries that dont cow to their demands are proof of this trend amongst allied states,r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMVFxcUdaVnV0anJxS1RzcFp1UmZLYndWckZzTllVZjBrRXhnWWJ4U1pubmRMMXZxM01oTi10SVBxQUpDZTA0ZW9WcXFMZVFpd18tcENzTVE3SHhmWEx2bml0T3pNa0Zsc3VGZkp1dkhKdTA9

the reason nato still exists is because russia abandoned the long process of rapprochement in the late s and early s restyling itself as a global rival to the us and setting off a series of energy crises in a bid to play hardball with europe had they not nato might have dissolved thanks to the loss of its raison detre but russia and particularly putin saw opposing the west explicitly as a way to generate national greatness and that breathed new life into the alliance,r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSRHR0WnF3NkQtVENPQkFXTG9uWmNqdkpzejNlYzJLd0NvbnF1c29sMVRPdUZHQTJMck9BeW1BeTl3TlhHSk4yNlFLYm9jWVFRc3U0QXltbFBJT3FtT1puTDFRa2hvNzBCb2RjSE9ibFZYSlk9

i love naive cynicism theres very little more unpersoning than that sure buddy the us was able to maintain a massive alliance structure because it was about fleecing its allies which presumably never realized that or something its the silliest thing tldr even if nato had announced its dissolution the day the soviet union collapsed the reality of nato military integration meant it would have actually been a <number><number> year plan to dissolve nato no nato persisted for years because nato is for countries what combined arms is for militaries every nato country is integrated militarily and ultimately plans its defense around nato membership meaning that they either lack certain capabilities entirely or in sufficient quantity removing a country from nato would require its own decadelong investment in replacing the capabilities it gets from nato that would be made more difficult because the nato commitment itself solves political problems in military spending by shaping its role in the overall structure actually leaving nato would require massive changes to a members military so even if the government had that as a goal it would be unlikely to leave for a decade or more just because it takes time to unwind and replace the nato structure,r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSeDBvSWRPcHZvTmNVemxUbUdzZV8wQko3WnE2RjVodVQtbjRKNS1hMXg4X0ZvSEFwbXBwZHJib2UxMVJ5RjVtLVNHTUNnMURkemtpQzRoS2d6b0RER0dWa3Y0dGhaSC1hekw4Zkc1Ty1TdUU9

thats exactly right theres a lot of videos just like this where some propagandist gives a false description of a real video then falsely claims that somebody else originated that false description theres an excellent recent propublica article about it here <url> > researchers at clemson universitys media forensics hub and propublica identified more than a dozen videos that purport to debunk apparently nonexistent ukrainian fakes the videos have racked up more than <number> million views across prorussian channels on the messaging app telegram and have garnered thousands of likes and retweets on twitter a screenshot from one of the fake debunking videos was broadcast on russian state tv while another was spread by an official russian government twitter account > the goal of the videos is to inject a sense of doubt among russianlanguage audiences as they encounter real images of wrecked russian military vehicles and the destruction caused by missile and artillery strikes in ukraine according to patrick warren an associate professor at clemson who coleads the media forensics hub > the reason that its so effective is because you dont actually have to convince someone that its true its sufficient to make people uncertain as to what they should trust said warren who has conducted extensive research into russian internet trolling and disinformation campaigns in a sense they are convincing the viewer that it would be possible for a ukrainian propaganda bureau to do this sort of thing > the videos combine with propaganda on russian state tv to convince russians that the special operation in ukraine is proceeding well and that claims of setbacks or air strikes on civilian areas are a ukrainian disinformation campaign to undermine russian confidence,r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJST1BxSWZkTVhRLXhKZFZ4RWEyNWhxei1Ldmw4SGlGalBPd1VMWm1uby1Pa3c5akFNdjlxYnljQ1R6YTN3UzZMekVJOUdiVTZ5aVowcDVzVHhrUi1EWmw1RFE4N3FDbkRYN2k4OFRuVnJsVTQ9
