oh the person above is a baitlaying doofus trying to call two things equivalent that absolutely arent but it is true that there are leftwingers casting doubt on whether or not the shooting was legitimate easy enough to find them in just a few clicks too its undeniable that the sentiment has circulated however it remains relegated to a small number of fringe deluded goofballs they are for the moment beneath notice and not really worth considering theyre just twitter randoms there is no movement and any attempt by people like the above to liken them to the qanon cult is simply an attempt to obfuscate deflect and distract look through their post history and it quickly becomes clear why theyd want to do this too theyre a bad actor if said sentiment ever grew in scope and was taken seriously by more than a few randoms if it ever grew influential in even a small way id be first in line to call it out but right now that isnt the case its just idle chatter on twitter by a small number of nobodies the person above is engaging in a whataboutism that is painfully idiotic,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCZGZhc2JqQ0lDYWxBQ1FHbE4xNDJHbTE1WG44NURvaWVYajRLNkxQSlJVRnRVOFVEQnhqQmYtVWVkSEl1N3RGeFlJY0JkN1U2MmswRzd4M0d4NlVkWDVEMXFid1kwMXo5d0UwWHdFeGZ4aG89

similar to the rest of the dating apps tbh they want to make men become addicted to the apps the same way women become addicted to social media and pay for premium subscriptions so they have many fake profiles that make men become frustrated with the apps and they pay for the premium service its actually very messed up to prey on peoples loneliness like that so keep it in mind if youre a straight man on a dating app,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRVME5LM21zMTBsa2RoODFJSl9ST1NJamJCaHBaRXZNUDI1bUJweXhMVVgtdWEwdjNPTDI0aUZ5UW5WUDRJLUstQUhqTGx6RWlRTXI2SHVWdjFCZFBiMGFzd2MwbVdieWxOb0pSOUd1VlNEZHM9

yes they were bots i was single in the early s and signed up for every dating site at the time my thinking with ashley madison was that the married angle was just a gimmick and it would be a regular dating site because how would that even work before i could even put up a photo or finish my bio i was getting messages from accounts with photos of ridiculously beautiful women this was back in the day when you had to scan a physical picture to put it on the internet and all the women on ashley madison had professional headshots instead of underexposed images taken on disposable cameras of women with awkward smiles standing in their living rooms you had to pay to reply which i never did every other day id get an email notice and check and it was clear they were bots on a regular site you didnt have to pay to message anyone and guys had to go chasing meth heads with missing teeth so it was odd that so many rich classy women with professional headshots would be chunking themselves at someone without a photo and a half finished bio there was no indication that i even had a job or a car or even mentally stable it was weird,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRVVU82aXR4QUEzUHppSi03MHBnVkxLZFdfYW5jUFp3ZVg0NTFhTk0zbmN3Ykphd2NvRGNJczltM3BBSTF1OGZWTWg5dmNwTDdTRE9kSVlBSy05QlprQ1E9PQ==

the frustrating thing is that theres very little attention to the core reason things suck will continue to do so due to oil industry influence we havent switched most of our grid energy production to nuclear in recorded history humans have never before continued to overwhelmingly rely upon an inferior energy source after identifying a better one photovoltaics wind are gapcover sources which involve a lot of plastic in generation equipment unfortunately they arent going to yield primary residential industrial power for billions longterm if we want to make good stuff again we need energy that doesnt affect human crop viability due to temperature energy which doesnt make it so much cheaper to manufacture using lowdurability materials,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmVmpEaGZ4Zjg5cmp5enYzYW0tRXNud0xBWktsTG0yZW1KNGRGaHZRTEV2UHVkN0FpaEtrLTNnZUFpQlVUMDZsMUN4cC1mcDhXXy1TUk9hMXY2RmpZMmZXX2xfZEgyY1NLQ1JlVng4aU1ZWTA9

shit tier stuff is a product of the world economy surprise a lot of the poor decisions of the us the world reserve currency create a bunch of problems the us main export is ink on papercotton other countries now need the dollar to help resolve debts they are more or less forced to trade with us to get out paper as the us inflates its monetary supply not only the us citizens feel it but everyone that uses the dollar worldwide this is great for the us consumer because we will feel the inflation less but it has its drawbacks printingfabricatingcounterfeiting money which the us is very good at means that the value of the money is lessened when the value goes down either the price of goods and services can go up or you can produce your good or service cheaper with less quality there is plenty of quality stuff out there but the price is prohibitive so a bunch of cheap shit is produced because the us doesnt really manufacture anything anymore they have to buy just about everything which has to include the massive costs of everything raw materials transportation manufacturing transportation again the us basically has to consume or the currency doesnt flow out to the rest of the world which would cause major disruptions in the global supply chain we end up with a bunch of shit quality because its what can be mass produced at a cheap cost,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmaldaRURnYVNPNWZpa3pYVWVzVUFaN1Nmb2RsMnE5TGVqWUFudXVRX2J6eEpZbmEwMi1LY2RJcVd4WURHaEowYWw2VnduN0Q3aDgtZlJjSzcxcEdfamc9PQ==

im sure you must be correct because again i havent seen it since then but what i recall of the documentary is that it is set up that the documentarian is there in south africa in ish at the time of filming the documentary and everyone thinks sugarman is dead or has no idea what happened to him and then he is in detroit where he is talking to sugarman who has lived his whole life in relative obscurity and poverty and then the reveal and off goes sugarman to tour south africa but that had all happened <number> years prior to when it was filmed again i suspect you must be right and that im misremembering the characterization of the story from the film,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmWEhkT21SQkpaYTB3OUhzalkxbVRJcW12Q0FZUjhrUkp4andnenIyNDh4eWR6WnRtcF8xR0xuMVBVN0ZZLWRscG50RHNXb0hlejBwOGNDd1otdDllQnc9PQ==

excellent original piece and excellent followup moyer is such a terrific interviewer and the families are really to be commended for their openness and honesty in sharing their lives from a narrative standpoint the best thing about this film is the absence of talking heads intercut throughout supplying statistics and editorial context to restrict the focus of the stories most viewers already know that medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy so cutting away to insert that fact as evidence in advocacy of a public policy shift would maybe make sense but it would disrupt the interconnectedness of themes and diminish the texture of the families stories deprive them of the full weight of all the ways that debt is felt an entire chapter couldve been devoted to delineating nafta but just leaving it as a distant mention on a television screen feels more accurate for seeming so much more remote indifferent and menacing,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmTGYyMDRTeUxldFVXQzdMT3ZjTDBHZ2ZtemxtR2p5cTFaUjVSVy0wWjdiZTlxcWNnT0tYUTdpRHpYSXRTbzNaQm4zMDJOTWdVeXVpUHdMV0wwVkpwYWc9PQ==

i was obsessed with this doc after watching it so binged every scrap of his story i could find i was puzzled during the reveal scenewhen sixto is sitting at the little table in his home and told hes a star in south africaand sixto seems unimpressed why would he act like that i though because he had already toured new zealand australia and europe and was a pretty big deal in all those places thats the part where the director was accused of misleading the viewer sixto already had a full music career but he had substance abuse issues which would bring him back to detroit plus he really loved his home in detroit before he passed away i drove through the beautiful historic neighborhood he lived in to see if i could find his house and more specifically that little window he poked his head out when it was revealed hes still alive he was such a unique soul and the world was much better with him in it edit i never did find that window,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmX3hsWkpscl9xdFBOWG1Ub3p5c0NSOWxnRkJKVkRSSXVRbmNBUEJsZVoyWXJxbG5lTW8xSEVVQnNKaGcwcXpibjdvWkZTVDN2N1hjOS0yaHVSTjBEenc9PQ==

its one of those documentaries that you always see recommended on here and especially on rmovies can i be the voice of dissent and say that its not a very good documentary the story it tells is gripping and harrowing but it is told in a pretty sensationalist almost exploitative way it is crafted to tear at your heart strings not to objectively put forth statements of fact it gut punches you repeatedly then sucker punches you in to believing youve seen something special something important and something we should come away from asking questions theres no entertainment here so it must be art but its just a really sad story told with everything turned up to eleven and little to no explanation given as to why or how the events that transpire occurred no insight in to the mindset or motivations of the people involved just that they did what they did and youre going to feel terrible about it its years since ive watched it and maybe im forgetting some of the finer points im not sure but that was the impression i came away with maybe its because the movie is so hyped and it always mentioned in comments as prepare to cry this will break you but its amazing etc i dont know watch it with tempered expectations and expecting to feel shit and you might actually get something out of it,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqRHEySFYwcXVuNzJkME9rV28tWHI4eTVfTDk0N3NHOGFvaUtfbzd5eWxXcHR5czRwZXBXeXFLdmduQk1jN3RTZjdlRFg1Skl1aThLdGZhNkxqWWZlV1E9PQ==

i watched this on a plane at the end of a holiday which is when i always have an existential crisis anyway so i found the documentary extra depressing im glad that both the stanleys and ms neuman count their children as their accomplishments but i find it so sad that people have to struggle so hard in their lives just to exist were so lucky where i live that healthcare is free at the point of use and we have a decent social security net i cant imagine having to not only worry about working enough hours to get by but also worry about getting sick and having to pay for healthcare on top of losing pay from being off sick i hope they all find some kind of peace in their golden years after all theyve been through,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqR2g1WU1NOEpKdl9nZnhlMGF6YnlNTFNubFhNLWFrd0dTYzlhZWJVSUJQaEdFUTR4WUhpeHRtcm1EYUZxbU90QTJvaWFqWGZWYWNtTE9lQWd3OTViQ3RlSWZhTm50dk5ueDdKX2R0dExwUms9

its essentially a mistress as most are with married men but more so its an agreed up relationship the money is the agreement that she wont tell the wife or try and take half your wealth her beauty and company along with a sexual relationship although some of the older guys just want a companion it can also lead to marriage or becoming a live girlfriend on the rare occasion mostly it will be a weekly or monthly allowance and that will mean an agreed upon amount of meets gifts are gifts and not in lieu of anything else some get flown about and go on holiday together so its intended to be closer to dating but essentially all cards are on the tableyou can have a relationship without the needexpectation to fall in love my guess is it developed naturally from gold digging women atleast with this agreed at the start of a relationship the guy isnt second guessing his girlfriend intentions just to steal his money and shes under no illusion theyre getting married,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxY3lPeER3bUtENnRSVjVCRnJGSjRTWHAtbGNMNUVKREFKa0xKZ0lRTmYtNk9Fek1jWG1XaV9NSU1yLUNqNGd4NG55dm4yMHVNOG5DaF9uSjJUaUZuS0V3LXB4b1NGMUdiZENOekstYlhEdWs9

absolutely its laughable if you look at the early investors in bitcoin theyre all big shots in silicon valley and people talk about how bitcoin liberates the average joe lol also no crypto bro has ever solved the fundamental issue no government least of all the us government will ever accept bitcoin on a large scale as the currency for paying tax so even if bitcoin was widely adopted you would still have to convert it at some point to dollars or euros to pay your income corporate capital gains tax and at that point the government can just easily shut it down as they have been doing just ban or severely restrict the financial exchanges and this issue will prevent the vast majority of people from adopting because whats the point if you eventually need fiat currency anyway its a gigantic game of musical chairs except the last one loses it all,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxVGlWSElBR01lRTZ6ZWpZRTJiZFczclZWMkNwMF9DUkdJeERiUU9yQnZqUzI3c196R1FIM01EYmNvR3JKNFZFQ0ZpcmRXQ1NhSExBMVN3Vy1VRDg2SWc9PQ==

its worth pointing out that her primary audiencesher clients as it wereare institutions and institutional functionaries more specifically those cultural organizations schools galleries museums publications etc that work as advocates of modernism which is to say that if you are seeing her or documentation of her events at a museum it is because she has found a way to give the museum exactly the sort of programming it wants everybody hopes the ticketbuyers and critics love it too but first and foremost it must satisfy the operational ideological tastes and values of the organs of cultural power that are promoting her as an example of mondernism if somebody can do all of that and draw crowds then youre going to see more and more of them over the years and museums are notoriously riskaverse so part of giving them what they want is managing the reputational risks of scandal or some other retrograde response better to have ticketbuyers walk away confused indifferent or feeling undereducated than hating it for some other reason,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQyN0k4aURoTmgzM0hvN3VKcnNFQ0YwZC1hbnlFQkpwU0tFUUJDZDctbEVkNmQ1SjZVZlZ0WjJqanFCYWhjOHdCWmdNd1RrdFRuWHY4YXBURUljb041alE9PQ==

it is written and directed by the best friend of the man its about the actions also transpire while hes creating the documentary so it makes sense that everything seems to be turned up to <number> as its all happening in practically live time the emotions are very real for everyone involved in the documentary when things turn its unexpected as that wasnt the initial direction of the documentary i think its phenomenal and so important to watch to truly see what people are capable of and i dont mean just the bad but also what comes out of it at the end,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBRmJrTnJlbkF4TjRURUx1ZTY0cmNUQ1ZrNFpSMURMcHdJSkVaQi1rWDNhVmxfZGM4RVNfSzMtcmJRdWE1dVAzSmJ5RVhGOGdCVkdTZ29NTGNfUzczTjZUZm91WEtscHlMY3R5cUJLTmU2ams9
all great points and i didnt meant to suggest that emotions of the subjects of the doc were exaggerated or anything like that i suppose my main issue with the doc is that it should serve as a definitive summary of the case because the guy making it is inherently biased yet so many who watch it take it as such and indeed it really seems to present itself as such at times not to defend the actions of the wife sorry i forget her name but are these the actions of somebody who is just purely evil or a deeply disturbed seriously mentally ill person likely some combination i dont know but the doc doesnt really explore that she just presented as evil incarnate and not much is done to address the fact that maybe the system let her down just as much as it let down the people she killed maybe it would be dangerous and irresponsible for an amateur filmmaker to tackle those subjects im not sure but ignoring them in favour of shes just a monster seems just as irresponsible or maybe it does and im forgetting like i said it is years since i watched it but that was the impression that i had afterwards,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBUHYtSUJKTVZVcWJlNDdobEJOWlo1Ylk4S0xyTlJoTDFLVXM0QzgyTVZ1Vk5PWUxzLV9rTjJXODc1OENqMDdRNGVGenpfcmFCdHVJYlhmOGJiSWg1cEE9PQ==
i totally understand where youre coming from it does touch on her past including the fact that she had <number> or <number> other children that she abondoned summarized from the doc but youre correct this is coming from a biased perspective i do feel like he did an amazing job still stating the facts in present time as they transpired the purpose of the documentary wasnt to look at her her past and her motives it was intended to be a video letter to a son from his father via all of his loved ones it just happened to morph as she did what she did he admits in the beginning he didnt know what would come of the videos and stories he was collecting he didnt know how it would end maybe someday someone will take a deeper look at her as a person to see if there was something more going on id definitely watch it if just to angry cry and scream at my tv again,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBcVNjZEh2LVk5S2tEMGVtdkQ0c2RXU2VzcHdBcnEzMHUxYVoyVmlnT0QxSFBSMi1RTHRYM1NjQTBnOEJveWpjYzdFM1ZrenczTDloMWc1N1o0WWpuTWczQjE0MXhocHFoZWtPajdIVzFtTzA9

yes the producers caught it during postproduction years after it happened and immediately contacted the authorities at the time they turned over the evidence the producers were told that they were now witnesses and shouldnt talk to anyone because any public statements they made could become a problem when or if they were called in to testify and they listened to and followed that advice la was busy getting their case together and didnt want to risk letting durst know they were on to him until they had to the prosecutors and fbi had all the information but they needed to put a solid case together and couldnt afford to jump the gun although durst didnt go on the run until the second to last episode aired when he realized he was caught with the notes but he was being watched just not very well when the fbi lost track of durst and realized he had gone on the run they fasttracked their prosecution plans remember that he got off for killing and dismembering a neighbor in texas and didnt want to risk him getting off a second time so la was taking a page from the doj and not chargingarresting until they were certain theyd get a guilty conviction the la prosecutor immediately got a warrant for his arrest and that was what they used to detain him durst was probably a day away from making his escape to cuba when he called his voicemail and the fbi phone tap picked it up and traced the call back to a hotel in new orleans he happened to walk into the hotel lobby the same time the fbi agents i think could have been us marshalls were at the front desk asking about him the timing of the arrest was coincidental and based on durst running not something manufactured by the producers and jarecki as some people claimed,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCY1pOdGdNUk0ta0U4YTUwYVpIWHF6dF9Oc3BkTkI5TXM3WU9KcE5pa0Y1Si1RRk1xRWFUbkpIb0NzdDNmYWtmWTlxODFZb0JwdGQ0YXU4VWI0YTdPNkE9PQ==

i had thought so too but it is not so the spelling kiev was an effort of russification to make kyiv appear closer to the russian conforms russification in general was a policy to assimilate all russian controlled territories to adopt russian culture and language and not to use their own a conscious effort to eliminate peoples culture but the preffered ukrainian spelling of their own capital is kyiv as it relates better to their own language and kyiv became recognized by the whole world as the proper spelling but prorussian outlets continue spelling it as kiev the subtext being to essentially say ukraine is not truly independent or its own thing and is instead a russian territory which is why with the context i am now choosing to spell it kyiv isnt it interesting how such a seemingly small and inconsequential change on paper to a four letter word has so much history and can draw political lines on its usage anyways hope that was helpful,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCRjM0NEdQRUV2MWpzOGtfbzF1alFuSkhJS1pYZU92U3YtSHc0YUo4WmR0a3p5aUlwSTRtbVMza0Fwa0RYNUtXTWZSN1EtU3U3bmNBOHRtRnpRNi1MWW8xTUxyUFhTSy1STXJlOHFtZTB1N0k9

check this out talk about insane first durst technically died an innocent man its a little technical but a defendants guilt isnt written in stone until all appeals have been exhausted as much as i hate to admit it this is why all the maga people are saying trump isnt technically a felon yet theyre sorta right okay but heres something i caught in the most recent series jinx <number> i think the opening sequence shows how durst was found and arrested there may be a reason this part was left out of the original series as it shows a possible wiretap violation that led that ego driven da to where durst was so my qualification for this is im a retired phone company flunky twenty years at swbtsbcatt about ten of those years i was a field technician all through the s so all landline stuff also all analog landlines are analog back then when the police got a court order to live monitor a suspects phone if it was in the area i worked i would be the tech tasked with going to a terminal and installing a range extender on the suspects wire a terminal is a cross box in the field where a bunch of cables come together a range extender was a small device that enabled cops to listen to conversations okay so knowing how the telco network works i know that a court order to listen to live conversations would only allow law enforcement to monitor conversations on one particular number if one person calls you and theyre monitoring you and you answer law enforcement is authorized to listen to you the person that called you is incidental their number does not have a court order but because youre talking to them regardless who called thats legal if you forwarded your phone to someone elses and answered a call placed to your number but you answered on the phone its forwarded to cops cant listen now think about how voice mail works when you call someone now and dont get an answer that call is forwarded to another number which is not your number and law enforcement doesnt have a court order to monitor that so while at a hotel in new orleans years ago durst on the run and phone tapped he goes to a pay phone in the lobby calls his own tapped cell number to retrieve any messages you know where im going the call is automatically forwarded after <number> or <number> rings then his voicemail picks up durst then hits whatever number it was to tell the system hes about to check the messages not leave one and the system responds with please enter your password remember durst is weird af to begin with so much so that he confesses to his tally whacker in the bathroom at one point so you can imagine how this phone call might sound anyway he hits <number> to prompt the password prompt then enters the wrong password again durst he then quietly utters some cuss words obviously mad about not remembering then tries a few other times uttering to himself the entire time meanwhile he wasnt talking to himself there was a detective back in los angeles listening the to every word the detective identified the voice as belonging to durst then asked a judge for an arrest warrant and got it and the rest is history but heres the thing the moment dursts call to his own number autoforwarded to the voicemail system that is a call from one number pay phone to a not durst number cell phone voicemail which the detective had no authority to monitor imagine that so you know after everything changed to digital in the mid s the technology for how cops listen completely changed but the law hasnt at least not this much court orders for wire taps are very strictly only for your phone number not you if enough evidence exists to get an order it doesnt say cops can fish or target every method of communication you use every physical method like someone elses phone or a random pay phone you just happen to be in front of if durst had answered his physical cell phone that night thats a legal listen but thats not what happened that detective didnt have an order on the pay phone or system number and dursts flip phone didnt have an onboard answering machine,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVEWllIdmw1R291b04tbjRaOXg2YUVMTXpzRzFOTV83MjBNVlpmRHowc0ZyaEJCTVk2NmtwY3lfTUQzSG9MRHpxSU5JeEFLUVZ6a25zYjNabVpEWXRRdXc9PQ==

what i mean is that its idiotic to talk about russificstion in the context of ukrainian area language especially with regards to kievkyiv which is historically a russian town from before the russia or ukraine existed as such its all simply ethno nationalist psycho shit i was born in a dual lingua country as the minority language for what its worth all of the language shit and nationalistic shit disgusts me as its a historical nonsense the modern concept of states barely existed until the first half of the th century theres no pure nationalistic language people spoke what they spoke by historical accident and kiev has always been russianand thats got nothing to do with loving putin but this ethno essentialism that the modern ukrainian state is all about paired with azov and their love of norse runes is definitely not convincing me of their lack of nazi sensibilities thats all im saying edit i am literally nordic and neither myself or anyone i know has nordic runes tattoos btw just in case anybody wondered if thats a thing nordic people do,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVMVmt5VXlQWXdmcXlndUprYUtVUWVpSzlMX0UwN3hxd0xWTGM3SU9kQXM0Uk1XSW9nbWFXR2dtN1ZLMU5OMzBqN21KcFJvQVhyWHU1N0x2OVVrcGJsWGc9PQ==

it is not true when you immigrate it is to study or to work and in either case you need proof of funds that you can look after yourself the government doesnt pay you to come here if youre a foreign student you pay x tuition compared to a resident i am sure immigration has propped up property values whether you are happy with thst depends whether you own a home many immigrants come to work there is a tremendous number of mexican farm workers under the temporary foreign worker program they make what would be a princely sum back home despite being minimum wage in jobs few canadians would do or even have skills for quite a few indians come to study and also work service industry jobs some get tied up with degree mill colleges which give a shitty degree some stay some go back back when i studied computer science <number>s there were tons of chinese students they paid way more tuition and even so were the ones running around in new acuras many immigrants buy businesses from retiring canadians and carry them on the nearby berry farm now has a general store and a liquor outlet the people who run it wear turbans and work their ass off i have stayed in more than one sketchy motel run by brown people this is not a problem for anyone the line about uber workers or tims employees has their finger on the point you can see the other side of this issue on rindia and searching for canada if you pay attention to the video the real issue is the cost of living and in particular housing my son can save money staying at home immigrants dont have that option,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnSExxaVlvSXRybmxtSHR3MHBfMnBGSWpraUpNTmF6NjZVQmswUVFZV0dDWk1uNVdVMThOekxVOXhDVjMzMHBrVVoxYzRTdUYtQ24zS29scEM4Z3NOTWc9PQ==

its disingenuous to say that peoples frustrations are specifically immigrants as in people who go through the long process of legally immigrating weve seen a huge influx of temporary residents in the form of temporary foreign workers tfws and international students on top of increasing immigration and permanent residency status these programs have historically been mutually beneficial to canada and to the workersstudents but have been opened up to abuse and exploitation in recent years hence the derogatory term timmigrants tim hortons coffee shops thats been circulating online to refer to tfws working in service industry jobs rather than strategic sectors where it has been historically useful similarly loopholes in international student rules have allowed international students to work more than ever when theyre supposed to be here to study and several public colleges have thrown academic integrity and their reputation to the wind to take advantage of the cash many pragmatic and politically moderate citizens want to see changes to immigration policy in canada to return to historical norms immigrants are not at fault here its bad government policy and exploitive business owners taking advantage of cheap labour and in return we get increased demand on housing social services and infrastructure all of which are already heavily stressed,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnclRCQmpBeWhkdUZzbHVWam5fS09ka2ZwMWp2THlaTkdwT1ZQNHVRekVGT3NOTDZ0ZlZvQ3ZiMVlTZi05ekxmX05WalF4cE9CallFekZFWHMwSnlYM0E9PQ==

i think that if were honest there is only europe turkey and maybe india who share these values the rest of the world is still very patriarchal very few countries have both support for liberal democratic values gender equality and a population that can realistically emigrate the majority of countries with population excess africa middle east also have regressive and conservative views on pretty much every topic i think that economic and social liberalisation brings prosperity but also lower birthrates which in turns creates countries that need immigrants and cannot afford losing people just think about it lets say that your ideal immigrants are british french belgians or dutch but all of these countries have low birth rates and already themselves rely on immigration and would rather keep their people and of course as a country transitions to a liberal democracy the will to leave the country goes down too also regarding from certain places to me a core value of the west is individual responsibility you do not share the sins of your peers so no matter where immigrants come from as long as they share the values you mentioned should be welcome there are many people from very regressive conservative countries think iran and russia who understand the problems of their country and prefer western liberal democratic values and are often militants who promote them and would be good immigrants it also happens to be the inteligentia of these countries,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnRThKY2s2Q3UtaTEta3dScU42d2swaUlyOHZHTHk1UHRnRkFnY0hDV0h0R3AxbmR5dkd2ZHBoQnEtNVZwTWZtRS04eldlQ0VTQ212R1VLaC1LNHFxTlE9PQ==

throughout history people lets be honest people of western european heritage aka descendants of european immigrants have used the same tropes to justify their bigotry towards people not born here or people that dont share christian values examples such as <number> we have homeless here help them first then allow immigrants in <number> theyre taking our jobs <number> they wont integrate into our society <number> this neighbourhood isnt white enough <number> white people invented everything all the above are things ive had said to me on quite a regular basis and i was born here theres numerous amounts of other excuses to justify bigotry towards nonwhite nonchristian immigrants the same people whose ancestors stole from first nations and flooded canada with almost zero restrictions they had a system set up to hugely favour them and block anyone that wasnt white these descendants of european immigrants are the same ones griping because they dont want to share the country at all thats where the privilege thing comes into play and it drives white folks nuts and they get all defensive when you remind them of their advantages over pretty well everyone else in canada but the facts are the facts any history book will lay it out for those who choose to get off their ass and read one all you have to do is look at the huge uproar when the syrian refugee thing happened a few years ago and then compare that with ukrainian immigration which was not so much of an uproar there was some but people were losing their minds way more when the immigrants from syria fleeing war as well were given an opportunity to come to canada anyone with half a brain knows why they just wont admit it fact of the matter is that when some multigenerational nativeborn canadians feel like their suffering the first group of people they blame are almost always immigrants they dont realize that immigration is a net plus to the country whos going to pay for their healthcare and fill voids in the workplace i know so many immigrants that have flourished and employ many others they are far more proud and far more loyal to the country then the types that fly the canadian flag upside down that think theyre freedom fighters while blocking the streets of ottawa theyre not leeches to society like the extreme right wing likes to portray them as the vast majority of them have done very well for themselves and over time end up paying far more to the country via taxes than they ever take theyre hardworking and willing to do what it takes to make canada their home frankly i think the people complaining about immigration need to get to work and quit spending money on tattoos smoking drinking and complaining that they somehow got hard done by or just dont complain because if you live in canada youre extremely lucky stats show canada is a top <number> place to live in the world and thats coming from the son of a family of immigrants that came here in the late s i will always be grateful i live here and am canadian ps i was born here and like most of my family weve paid more than weve ever taken to be canadian the only difference between us and white canadians is that unlike them we have to listen to countless people tell us why we dont belong,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnZW51cEhxbXRoRnZaZmRRd2ZVOW9aOUphUHdJOW5EWnhxeFNBcHg1d1RYMENlNV9pLUdhZ2w1U19iYXplTkJZNjJ3TVlxbFVLX3ZiaFZVZnl0b2NJV3c9PQ==

immigration is fantastic if its sensible you pick the best and brightest who have specific skills and experience you need more of and are unable to produce domestically for the time being who are the most willing and able to assimilate into your culture and who will bring the greatest value to society and the economy you should not treat immigration as a magic bullet to cure your own demographic challenges nor should immigration be a tool to fill employment in roles the local labor market just doesnt want to do nor should you expect little or no integration and assimilation from your migrants they are there to become as the majority is not the other way around and you should not import more than you can easily support not just right now but <number> or <number> years down the road as their needs change also you probably should not treat migration as some sort of moral imperative to fix your wickedly undiverse read white population either this creates resentment and taints all the great benefits of migration canada and sweden off the top of my head are two nations who have spectacularly failed in these regards,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnb21zTy1MQlFpS2duME1iaFdJQ0NHbDRaaHZaX0M0ckNLdVV2NTVuOVA0WGhoZld4MExNbG1rTlYzZkw0WGhSc3JKaW9DY1NfNFRXcnFySkd4QTdWVWRBS01SZXhDM0JVUm8zREd1OEpKZDg9

cultural enclaves have always occurred throughout the history of human migration human beings are tribal by nature if youre part of my tribe i can trust you if youre not part of my tribe i cannot trust you this mindset has served not just prehistoric humans but nearly every species of animal on the planet its instinctive the problem this causes today and in recent history is when large groups of people not speaking to any one particular group who have a common tradition of violence crime vagrancy hate towards other groups illiteracy destruction etc etc etc move enmasse to places where better traditions have become well rooted while individual people from these groups might migrate to a more prosperous land assimilate the traditions that made that land prosper and go on to become prosperous themselves a massive influx from the same group would tend to form enclaves keeping the same traditions and habits that kept them from being prosperous in their homelands while being distrustful of anyone from outside their enclaves,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoY2hnM2QwdVU4RUM5RFh5NHQyNTFoUWZkSm5rOEs5QzBFTU9XWFdNQ0dId3ZoNE41VnN0cmtnYU1sWGljTmNGY2xOUFlUWHlWdnVhQWd4NEttLVZ6TXc9PQ==

really if youre an immigrant in this day and age you should absolutely be the sort of person who has the character and traits to adapt to fit in and to adopt the culture of your hosts this idea that people are just incapable of anything other than sequestering themselves into ghettos and retaining everything about the place they came from such that they might as well have never left is stupid and pretty insulting plenty of immigrants do things the right way its just unfortunate that quite a few western nations with huge intakes of migrants have allowed parallel societies to form and failed to demand proper integration and assimilation thats almost always bad for the host,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoNWJyR0U3Uy1hbVh5VmN3QkdFZklrUkM4RXpYeW5yU3pDOHNQcmFBNHVyUFdMRTNPM21JMW1HRW9NN0ZXeUpWQmhXMjR0TC1zUk1BOGdqNlZUWG1uaGNhSE5hVHVuLWVtUlo4Q09zZEItNlU9
i gave my own lived experience and your response was essentially no youre imagining it now that ive provided the statistics you seem to think that the cultures you can see have moved into london are identical or even similar to those that were there before do you actually believe that crime rates are far higher now than they were before monoculture countries havent seen similar increases and i believe if our ethnographic profile hadnt shifted so dramatically we wouldnt see the same change hard to prove though we wouldnt have grooming gangs of pakistani men raping and abusing white children as weve experienced multiple times in the uk if we hadnt imported millions of people from a culture who hold such little value on women and childrens rights lgbt people would be safer and more welcomed in cities like bradford and birmingham if large parts of them werent majority islamic thats not to say the country would be perfect or crime free but it would unquestionably be very different as was my original assertion the thing is were very early in this the demographics will keep shifting and the proportion of native white british will keep shrinking its not too bad right now but when my children are adults or my grandchildren i truly believe the uk will be a much more right wing dangerous place because were importing people from right wing dangerous countries who are not integrating in many cases even in nd and rd generations and theyre breeding much faster than us your bucket of water in a lake analogy is honestly naive and silly,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoY25lMEMxWjhteDZsS2dicmFOSU00aHUyQjdJS05SbXN5eVdULUk3NFVXRVFCaDU1MXZGdFgzSGFWZFFOc04zcXEwbVV4OWp2TDItNzE1Zm9XUFU0SGc9PQ==

my analogy is perfectly fine you simply disagree because i had the audacity to tell you to focus on measurable outcomes rather nebulous claims of culture and yes your lived experience is entirely valid to criticize if youre secretly a white nationalist that bias would deeply color your interpretation vs if you were fullblown ultra leftist hippie would i do not know you your claims of lived experiences cannot be used any more than my lived experiences could be hence why youre not seeing me try and tell youre wrong despite living in toronto canada we could use my lived experience as a qualifier if you like it has greater validity than yours as the topic is canada but i know that anacedotes arent particularly valuable the london crime rate is up when measured in aggregate but its mostly petty crime violent crime such as homicide is down by nearly <number> since the s the massive increase in nonviolent crime we see occurring during the covid lockdowns and subsequent years seem to be dropping to past levels if youre not talking about violent crime which kinds of crime are you specifically referring to the uk has had gangs for hundreds of years just because the immigrant gangs make the news doesnt mean homegrown gang problems are a lesser issue if anything it would seem that gang violence has also dropped so outside of your anaecdot here about pakistani gangs there seems to have been less gang activity over all what does more welcomed mean what policy action or stats do you have to support this claim youre repeating a lot of dubious claims that rely almost entirely on personal feelings or headline news rather than statistical backing you still havent named a single government policy fyi at most youve got a few localized issues do you see now why i told you to stop this culture nonsense when questioned on it you have literally nothing to back your opinion on you have no policies you have <number> stats that back the claim that uk culture has changed in <number> years dont you think it would be better to make a claim that you could back with actual information something that wouldnt rely on your personal bias to confirm ps my country has far far more immigrants per capita than yours does <number> vs <number> nearly <number> more so perhaps i have greater authority than you do to claim that higher of immigrants do not shift culture as readily as you claim there are real measurable demonstratable issues with unchecked immigration that you could point to and use an anchor for your position instead you have decided to rely on this nebulous claim of culture because its emotional scary lets peoples imaginations run wild the problem with that is the moment you scratch at it a little bit it becomes apparant that <number> of the <number> claims made are backed by little more than trust me bro that makes them bad arguments dude maybe instead of culture talk about job availability housing high skill job access access to schooling lgbtq policy changes policing actions govt policy decisions or anything else that immigration in high numbers measurably impacts you have tons of options instead you talk about culture because then anyone who agrees with you doesnt actually need to know anything to go yeah meanwhile every person imagines a different thing while acting like youre all talking about the same thing its just lazy man,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoMllOc0tTbW91NXpYQUlQa1FRQjBGYjI2TEZzbnhZUUpqQy15LUdtak1IaUU0ZlVma2JhbUNwR2MzVHI4c1NVWWdtVVFKelZYaUdYaGRxZHp2QmJyTkE9PQ==

we basically added another city of ottawa k people to the country in a single year to put this into perspective this is like the us adding the entire city of houston every single year or germany adding a munich every year please tell me how this is even remotely sustainable when the county is facing a severe housing crisis and jobs are not abundant and do not pay enough to keep up with the rising cost of living please tell me where do we send another city of ottawa worth of people next year and the year after that or do you think it is perfectly ok for newcomers to be crammed into a small house shared with <number> other compatriots scraping by to pay rent and other basic expenses is this the canadian dream we are selling to new comers its bad on them too they also deserve to reap the benefits that canada can provide but is increasingly unable to and lets not kid ourselves a major driver for this absurd level of immigration comes from greedy corporations looking to supress wages by importing newcomers that are more willing to work for low wages than canadian citizens or residents that are accustomed to living here they are being exploited for cheap labour and we all come out losing here while the corporations continue to enrich themselves and grow their hold on canadian markets as it stands canada is really only able to provide more security and better access to nature and some essential services than other nations but that is about it the cost of living and housing challenges and a colossal barrier that is only growing for every successive wave of newcomers and the security benefits will quickly fade as more and more people living on the margins of society turn to crime and harmful activities out of necessity to make ends meet we are importing a group of people that are increasingly vulnerable to this level of exploitation this is not how the canadian dream is supposed to be there has to be a line drawn somewhere and we have jumped over it without second thought to how unsustainable it is skin color and race have nothing to do with this and i say this as a decendant of immigrants myself and as a visible minority,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVocDRFYVhOQ1g4dURxWmVmMnJOb2h1VUhfN3F5SC1oX0ZkVDB4QWRXRXhvN0FaOTVMTk40YVMxY2tvcFhfaWk4cUh4aFk3dFFiQ3ppZWFlX0t2bzZKYVE9PQ==

im critiquing you on your vagueness fair enough i honestly believe the uk authorities purposefully make it hard to be specific with statistics of these crimes hence why the grooming gangs were allowed to attack white girls for so long because the police were terrified of being accused of racism for example you said per your own security services right wing extremism is a substantially bigger threat this is the sort of thing i mean when i say its hard to be specific because the authorities absolutely downplay the risks exactly like that quote from our security services look at the list of attacks in the uk in the last <number> <number> years and tell me which is a higher risk the many many islamic attacks with multiple casualties or the small handful of right wing extremists <url> its hard to be specific because crime by immigrants is downplayed and minimised by the uk authorities right now the headlines in the uk are all about right wing protests and riots which are reprehensible but as disgusting as these are its a small amount of property damage and some bruises theyre in response to an attack by a second generation immigrant who stabbed several young girls to death last week that attack was minimally reported compared to the current protests its swept under the rug because the perpetrator was nonwhite and reporting on crimes by that demographic is avoided as much as possible here so being vague is inevitable when facts are purposefully obfuscated and minimised,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoeFdDTVhnQ2lnYWhBZkVwczlUQm9jWGtYbWNkTks5ZXR1UXF5bV9YVzlRX05SV2N2QU80ZnNqa2R2bjVTSTVOTjJOaFN1Ql9hMUl2bHRYbjJUTXptblE9PQ==

which is fed a great deal by the tfw they bring their families over whom are unskilled or after their two years just stay here and dont go home which is not very temporary imo between that and refuges who bring their conflicts here i would agree about the lack of integration normal immigration to canada is very expensive i know many people who have come here by this route and they are proud canadians and are happy to integrate it is ironic when i hear them complain about the immigration problem here and those who come here and dont want to integrate they think it is bullshit and hate that they give everyone who does integrate a bad name they say those like that should have just stayed in their og country if they dont like the culture here,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVobmNTTkhlYXBzTk5zOS1hTTg0RGRodndxUk1ZdU5BRUdac0hRSEdOc2pvOEZYeHBlUjNqMjF2QnJzZkY4T1ZIU2NPQjBxUjM3Z3U2VF9rVlZzcWwxTHc9PQ==

abandoning multiculturalism in the canadian context doesnt mean not working or being friends with people of other cultures canadians overwhelmingly approve of that it means abandoning the failed cultural mosaic idea and returning to the past biculturalism though this time ideally with a greater respect for natives and no discrimination on an ethnic or racial basis anyone should be able to become a canadian but you should actually have to become a canadian not just remain an indianchineseethiopianetc living in canada there should not be places where its hard to find a house to rent because youre the wrong caste or places where its hard to find a job because you only speak english and french,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVpTi1VbjFHOWVzTkdTeUVjZXFaZ2l6cC1XVUpVS0F3TExfYXlmZkx4aXJqOXVlUno0SGNEcFN0VHdqWENlZUE3bmQ3MlJlRExKeW9YSVZQT0tmMFVLYzlCNWJIV0ZpRlZqS19TZWgydGJhc1k9

we are soooo unprepared as a society for the shit that is normalized abroad i say this as i have latin america hereitage and have traveled to the region more times than i can count to the point where i am a bit desensitized to it i sort of got resensitized after traveling with a group of canadians as in they have lived here their entire lives to a south american country many of whom have never been to the region or a rd world country and was amused at seeing their reaction to some of the wild shit that is normal there now imagine this shock on a national level with millions of longtime canadian residents and citizens to these massive influx of newcomers many of whom are unwilling to integrate and will bring their culture with them by all means share the foods and holidays language and customs but there will be bad actors that will also bring negative and objectively harmful values with them and worse will be unwilling to change normally they tend to make up a small portion of the pool of newcomers as most tend to be more honorable and willing to adapt but with the sheer volume of newcomers we will inevitable see an equally large share of dishonest and harmful values and individuals get dragged along to the detriment of everyone involved honest and honorable immigrants will be blamed for the actions of these bad actors more and more long time residents and citizens will have to put up with more frequent instances of crime violence and poor actions by these individuals in time such activities start to be normalized within certain groups which will inevitably drive backlash from other groups with cost of living being so high as well as housing being so scarce and job market being oversaturated with cheap labour many will inevitably turn to crime thus fueling this vicious cycle even more the more unequal a society becomes the more its members tend to embrace activities considered immoral or unjustified by said society and the more people fall into this the more it will drive extremist views by both canadians and newcomers alike everyone loses safe for the corporations looking to make ever increasing profits by exploiting the cheap labor made available by all these newcomers and realestate investors milking canadian society for every last penny knowing they have free reign given the insane demand,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVpaG1ZOHJQekR6Mm1TNENWNjhlLTU3d0tJZ19iQzFQLWxYbmg1LXFaMDJLU0NsbUlJZE8yZ2QyelJxUmhucjM2aXh0R1dpRGZOTU9aXy1VU1RHeWE2dmc9PQ==

but they all speak english right thats the challenge that exists that didnt used to exist we used to pride ourselves as the quilted mosaic where everyone is allowed to have their own identify and traditions while being canadian compared to the us which known as the melting pot which wanted everyone to be american the difference now is its not a quilted mosaic any more if people are relegated to isolated communities the modern issue is that people are arriving before they know the language so its incredibly hard to become a part of a new community its much easier and more straightforward to join a community of people like you especially if you all speak the same language is it inherently a bad thing i think the jury is still out a little bit but it is totally different than it used to be,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVpY3NvNmNIMGk2RW5McnVzakFINTR6RFBPNTdIZmI2Vzd3d2hJQVlmX3JmOC1rX3pTVmVudUZKWDdkV2FfTFBxV04tb2psWldFMldPWjl5T0NWMS1qLTAxaXNOUU41VFcxRzFuLXBMRjNvRmc9

the comment posted on this blog suggesting that kirk douglas in his old age made thanksgiving in peshawar for the cia is baseless following are relevant details about the late actors participation in the documentary film that i produced in <number> as an executive producer at the us information agency usia the films sponsor and distributor an attribution clearly stated in the end credits the usia better known by its radio service the voice of america was and independent agency with its own congressionally allocated budget its management took its direction directly from the president at that time ronald reagan the decision to follow mr douglas trip to pakistan with cameras was a decision made by usias director charles z wick a presidential appointee mr douglas undertook the trip as a guest of the government of pakistan that welcomed him as an official visitor the cia had no role in the films initiation financing or editorial direction claims to the contrary need substantiation a slope too steep to climb in the s and early s kirk douglas was wellknown for his philanthropy and as an outspoken advocate for freedom and democracy around the world before his trip to pakistan in <number> as an advocate for afghan refugees living in the tribal areas of northern pakistan he had already traveled as a private citizen and at his own expense to fortyplus countries speaking to audiences about why democracy works and what freedom means in <number> president jimmy carter awarded douglas the presidential medal of freedom in a white house ceremony in recognition of his advocacy for freedom and selfdetermination years later he received the french legion of honor for distinguished services to france in arts and letters like most everyone in the free world mr douglas saw the soviet unions <number> invasion of afghanistan as an attempt by that communist nation for domination and territorial expansion and he expressed those opinions in his narration of thanksgiving in peshawar it is little surprising that he was so motivated the son of jewish immigrants fleeing persecution from the russian empire he grew up in poverty in upstate new york amsterdam and was always grateful for the freedom his country provided him to work obtain a college education and scholarships to acting school during the great depression when his country entered world war ii he enlisted in the us navy where he served as a communications officer until medically discharged in <number> for injuries sustained in a depth charge explosion the comment about kirks old age in <number> is laughable when he and i worked together in pakistan douglas was a vigorous man of sixtysix he managed the packed sixday itinerary with ease and ran our film crews to exhaustion covering the events on his schedule at the time of the visit he ran an active hollywood production company and had just finished starring in two major films the final countdown in <number> with martin sheen and the man from snowy river the <number> australian film that won critical acclaim and earned fifty million dollars fifteen times over its production cost immediately after leaving pakistan he began making the hbo movie draw followed by the <number> cbs movie amos three years after our work together he reunited with his longtime costar burt lancaster in the blockbuster crime comedy tough guys in the remaining thirtyeight years of his life kirk douglas was a creative force in acting producing and writing even after a debilitating stroke in <number> he remained a public figure and revered champion of personal liberty and human rights his legacy should not be stained by cheap shots posted by ignorant commentators ashley hawken,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwNjhjN09uM2NMSXFNaU1ib0RRRXEwQjV0cFdmMzdfNmlrSHFDM3BTVzZWbEVDN0lmdHUwWFQ5TzNFV1R5bGE1d0ViRjFiaFFONmY5RllIYkZmUEFFeVE9PQ==

in germany and many other european countries theres this ingrained belief that anything rightleaning carries the taint of nazism while the left seems immune to criticism no matter how far off track it goes its like theres this unspoken rule left is good right is bad without considering the actual degree or context as a result weve been caught in a <number>year spiral of leftleaning policies to the point where even questioning the effects of illegal immigration labels you as farright its gotten so extreme that simply voicing concerns about immigration or any other issue is enough to get you branded and dismissed the left seems to believe that if they throw enough labels at a problem itll disappear but in reality the issueslike those caused by immigrationarent going anywhere now even farmers and workers who are directly affected by these policies are being labeled as farright just because they speak up the real issue is that the left is unwilling to budge on anything that doesnt align with their ideology they hold on tight to their belief that they are morally right and thats all that matters to them no matter how wrong or damaging their policies may be and this is exactly how you end up at a boiling point where actual extremism starts to take root,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZGaE5sVXJFS01JTXVraXhEZWY0b20zb3djSXRpYTBhWjRHZUR1NzFNV1l1MjgzLTdLaWxUaWxKSU5yUV9xdHFpT3pJeEpIcktfZVNORndQUXNOZ2hnS0E9PQ==

that depends whether or not we consider our society to be a free and liberal democracy that makes possible collective selfgovernance and collective selfdetermination if such a society did exist then we would have influence beyond mere personal choice but sadly its mean world syndrome and the conditions that promote it that undermine that possibility various countries have collectively enforced regulations on the media and many still do in order to promote a more democratic media system eg us fairness doctrine we arent collectively helpless that is the problem with the mean world syndrome it undermines and compromises the capacity to act freely by making people feel isolated alone and helpless criticism of those advocating for greater moral responsibility itself a product of mean world syndrome,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHb3VQUlNwbDdiRG5tX2RkUTQ0U21YVV9zWU4tQURrNks1YnptcFA5YkV1ODBjZVQ2LUhjU1NEckJmN0w1ZHFEaUFzRV9FNE1ycjRlanNPNFk1M2ZVdE82LWNubzJ3RXRPS2JEdVVzalJzSU09

if you look at the estimated violence data from past centuries even the least violent periods back then dwarf the highest violence spikes of the past century most of us modern westerners are entirely disconnected from what a violent society is actually like then again there are entirely new kinds of stressors in modern society in and outside the west that can have problems as bad or worse than violence chronic stress even when moderate can be more traumatizing than the acute stress of a onetime violent event humans arent designed to deal with continuous stress and anxiety that feeds into the mean world syndrome that gets portrayed as violence of course we could argue that slow violence is violence too but that would be to change the frame of the discussion entirely that is what confuses matters the conflation of physical violence with perceived violence created by general stress,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHNnJDWmpqZ00zRDR3bndmWVlVM1dxaTN1RjdOV01ZUEIzNUhZMzB1ZlNpcUQ3cXhDWS1TcVlWUXhIbzY2VG5hRzE1eVZacUtIaDk2eEVYY0ppWUtNQ0puOWQwcUxHXy1iUDFvdFlSV3hzQ3M9
its possible that most americans are traumatized to varying degrees this likely seems implausible to many because in not understanding trauma we underestimate it research shows that chronic stress living paycheck to paycheck high inequality fearmongering media etc potentially can be more traumatizing than major events of acute stress like violence at least when the acute stress is isolated and brief,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHc2ZCTUx1MnUwMlFKakR3OGZMeTFPM3FQeVNFTnZ3OTBSQk83aW1ncWlPNzlVYzk2VXhOTi1YUlUxVktmei1qRWhCT2lHS2R6a2VMOGlod0RZbFAtOWtwcXRFWktkdjF0NmxDSUtFbEdWSkk9
>at the end of the day the conflict in the middle east is fueled by the iranians and their export of the revolution this is by far one of the most naive takes on the conflict and reeks of western propaganda the conflict in the middle east is fueled by israels occupation its continued oppression of the palestinians and us meddling if the us stopped arming supporting and protecting israel a solution to the conflict would have been implemented eons ago hezbollah and hamas came to existence because of what israeli occupation and practices the killing imprisonment and brutal conditions which they were subjected to resulted in their formation remove the reason they fight the fight ends and iran has no one to support lebanon is a hub for international meddling youve got the phalange party whose leader is an israeli puppet youve got future party whose leader is a saudi puppet youve got the progressive socialist party whose leader sells his allegiance to the highest bidder usually the us hezbollah with direct ties to iran and so on jordan is a former british bitch now passed on to the us it is rampant with corruption nepotism and police brutality its kings six offshore bank accounts revealed in the swissleaks hack are filled to the brim with the money the us gives under the guise of aid it is a spy and operation base for most of the worlds spy agencies the british even control and manipulate what the media and news are allowed to show and say egypt is a military dictatorship its president is a us groomed and prepared asset that took over the presidency when it became obvious morsi wasnt going to play ball the military industrial complex there owns and operates businesses and factories ranging from candy to steel and other industries syrias conflict is about gas and oil pipelines and breaking russias stronghold on the european gas market had they agreed to break away from russia and let the pipeline go through they wouldnt be at war ksas mbs killed and chopped up a dissident journalist the country treats their shia minority like lepers opresses and antagonizes them they use their money and status in the region to bully smaller neighboring countries into toeing the official saudi line or suffer the consequences see qatar and lebanon for examples of that i could go on and in mote detail but this should suffice to show youre literally clueless about the region and gobbled up propaganda >a lot of people dont want to see that bc it gets rid of the over simplified and conspiratorial narrative that feels good to them the irony of calling the truth oversimplified and conspiratorial is evidently lost on you,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHWE8yWkpXbGRyXy1PckxYNlFZb0IwVFNSbFB5ZExieEdoTjBiajFJNzBRMXM2bVVhTWlmbFdrelZpWlVYSV9RVUstYkdPTVBmdGJYcDFRRFNNd1AtTnc9PQ==

here is what is hard for people to wrap their minds around some aspects are getting better as some are getting worse i wonder if this mix makes it feel even more distressful particularly combined with generalized chronic stress and freefloating anxiety while our lives are generally safer and more comfortable so many of us are constantly stressed out overwhelmed and exhausted historically speaking at least here in most of the developed world violence rates are extremely low the worst problems of poverty have been moderated with welfare public education and literacy have become the norm and on and on yet we are facing potentially worldchanging consequences of climate change a looming world war that could devastate civilization and possibly a new era of totalitarianism worse than the last infectious diseases parasitism and nutritional deficiencies are less common yet numerous other diseases health issues and neurocognitive conditions are skyrocketing cardiometabolic diseases autoimmune disorders cancer infertility dementia mood disorders psychosis autism adhd learning disabilities etc this particularly stands out in the us with high rates of stressrelated diseases addiction and alcoholism the medias fearmongering narratives are at least comforting because they are simplistic and straightforward giving the illusion of a world that makes sense without having to consider the nuance and complexities whereas to comprehend reality as it is requires higher levels of thoughtfulness intelligence critical thinking media literacy and education,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHak1DNWRsLUhIZFFPX2UtV0ZNVkJkUVpoOEIwOTlKUFJ3RUNuUDFxV2J1VlNqNmNrYm9YaFZMOEg2UWdud0RmeDhGUkY3TGdKQXFTUXpzWjNHVTVMUWR0SXI1M0U3aWZfX0tfa2dJQnRBbVk9
the corporate media arent only scratching an itch but also causing or exacerbating that itch it would be like a company selling an antiitch ointment that contained a skin irritant it would temporarily soothe while over time worsening the discomfort,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHSG9Yb1N1N3lLbDFVdWxmTUFCdElIUW1zQjZMUTRsSTZ2QS10YXVXNVFiemFqMzFBTDBBTndZUUZyR3kzb0hYTy1ONTFMOXV1LXpRV2xpa2lqUGcyMjlRN1M2M3ptSXFCT1AwVXJaSklDdXc9
scratch a cynic and youll find a failed optimist one hears that claim made but it isnt entirely correct i dont feel like a failed optimist so much as i conclude the society i live in has morally failed to live up to even a fraction of our collective potential also its more about pessimism than outright cynicism because i can see the potential i often lean toward longterm optimism my optimism never went away i just understand almost all progress happens over generations centuries and millennia so im often a shortterm pessimist about the immediate world particularly in terms of each election cycle,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHWHk2amcySGNrUEkzX0tua0o0VTRBNmY0U1lwdnBXU3h3N3ljMFRvdy1ZQWt2WDFkTXF1ekk2RnJ4MkR3MnF6enZaVktoYmJUY2xQNkZhcTdZZVdhSlQwT2xGb1ZreFpJZm5VWW12RzV0Umc9
the point is that you arent asking the media to selfregulate as with the fairness doctrine we can and have in the past regulated corporate media for the public good to treat we the people as collectively helpless directly plays into the media narrative of mean world syndrome cynicism apathy isolation etc,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHTkQtQkhmYVJoVWJiN2FrNUJ1eGQyeXI1LVFRYWpiMjYtS1hUTUpzSWdzNEM4azNtUV9ZcnBmSlZTMk5CSkxkTnNEak4xOUVtcjBqZ0tULVNwSzJKRmNsRjZkVUFFaHNqaXozY3FLQk9QdmM9
another example of how we arent collectively helpless if we the citizens dont like a government that cuts funding to what promotes the public good then we have the right freedom responsibility to change that government and if they act despotic we should do as the american founders did not necessarily the violence but the demand for selfgovernance the american revolution was incited over less egregious oppression than we are presently experiencing many people forget that so why are we so much more cynical apathetic and passive that is what the corporate media does as the propaganda arm of the government we need to learn media literacy the american founders didnt have to face a highly advanced propaganda system,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHR2dzY2o0ZjFqaWM0aGpVTDVBNGFtQUxyU0tWUnpJY282ZTlPdXBZMFdsMXpIbDR5N3BPOFFxY0wzQXI4TDg4bXB0Wk5rMklFdGx2dmhuOW5jY2pYTnY2TEQyckZhcWQ5emU3U2xNZGRPYWs9

when you rewind and see the formation of megastudy group in the early <number>s and how bronfman went to russia to put most of the kleptocracy parts into play even before the soviet union broke down it restarts the timeline back almost a decade <url> <url> then you start seeing trumps attorney roy cohn who introduced rupert murdoch to reagan just to play him like a fiddle as he devolved into

would have stopped <number> of this but by default it also shows just how ruthlessly vigilant the russian oligarchs were at executing their bigger play against the us democracy even while the ussr was coming apart at the seams the israel relationship aipac capex and jeffrey epsteins mega group intel work all went both ways with the russians and considering what a sensitive subject the red army failing in afghanistan was to the russians charlie wilsons war you start to see korea vietnam and afghanistan as different moving fronts of the same war between the st and nd world at the expense of

you dont care about a little casual genocide to pump a war kleptocracy play and drain the american treasury its just another tuesday for the oligarchy they just needed netanyahu in power in israel to play the inbetween and push the aipac agenda through the backdoor while pushing the religious wars up front israel and saudi just drained some more us assets off on the way past you can even backtrack that objectively through aeronautic espionage of the f<number> and f<number> jet developments and how that data moved through israel and on to russia and their ally chinas respective jet development programs as a backup to your dataset you can fake a lot of things but you cant fake good engineering transparent democracy was always bound to turn into a binary fight against authoritarian kleptocracy freedom of speech is a direct threat to the established and very lucrative business model of aristocratic authoritarian kleptocrats eisenhower identified it and warned about it in his final speech a few years before john kennedy was killed over it in world war two even before the lend lease program solidified the corrupt relationships between the military industrialists soviet era

jim smyth the detective who interrogated russell williams stated that how russell came on their radar is they set up a road block near jessica ls house the last murdered victim a le had been on the road that night and noted an suv in the field next to the house but didnt stop and get the tag info the night of the road block to check for suspects russell was the last one to the road stop going home from the base that night and they were going to shut it down they noted his tire tracks were very similar to the ones they found in the snow and of course it was an suv russell also stated he needed to get going as he had a sick child at home he needed to attend to when they looked on his profile they saw he had no children so him lying flagged their attention in addition to the tire tracks then they noted he had residences in all the places the women had been victimized then russell williams willingly gave his dna thinking if he acted cooperative nothing would happen i guess he also wore the same boots to the interrogation that he wore to jessica ls house jim smyth said if he hadnt confessed that night they still would have ended up cracking the case with him as the perpetrator it just would have taken longer,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhaEw2S1JXMWZfcnozXzV4V29DMWxobUNwcXlVblZ0VjhLaF9aVmxnQ2VCSV95RnEzWEpjVVBNRy12OVEwM1BSSXBPbnVMOFhjWFF4bHpDYmZ0ZGJHelE9PQ==

yes classic example of a horrible le interrogation is the interrogation of sarah boone where the detectives basically just argued with her for several hours instead of building repo ire and taking the signs she gave them to make her feel heard to give her an out so she felt safe confessing to stroke her ego and to take her clues about what is important to her they likely could have had her singing like a canary if they had asked her about what she endured as a dv victim if they had told her lies that anyone would understand her wanting to make her boyfriend pay and they completely understand she valued integrity and would never have hurt him intentionally she would have relaxed and likely would have said things that would have made the conviction in court easy as it was all they did is argue with her which made her clam up and not talk more,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhRjdoYUNWZjRUMGVIaDFTa1FuQjY4R3hlTXpPaE52OG0zWFRxdWVQSDV1Mnc0V3pWQU9ibmc2M0tlR09kWUZ2QWJGanFFWC1PQ3Z0cjBEb3RMQnlxa0E9PQ==

actually not true the behavior panel interviewed jim smyth and they had very little evidence against williams the day he walked in <url><url> jim smyth said all they had on russ the day they brought him in was that he had homes in both areas he crossed paths with all these four womendrove by their homes lived nearby or worked with them at the base his tires were similar to the tracks in the snow by jessica ls house and he lied when they did a road stop to shorten the road interview russell told them he needed to get home to a sick child whom they found was non existent when they researched it they had absolutely nothing else at that time but jim smyth was masterful in building repo ire and the techniques he used he brought a huge file in with russels name on it that was practically empty and he winged it going on clues by russel as to what was important to him so jim smyth masterfully handled this interrogation and once they saw the boot prints and tire tracks were the same he winged it and confronted russell he didnt do this before just acting like they were just trying to rule him out as a suspect and asked what he would be willing to give them he agreed to dna samples and boots etc thinking if he cooperated they wouldnt suspect him further jim says they still knew it was a long shot because likely <number> vehicles had the same tires and many people could have worn boots like russell had on he winged it not knowing but suspecting once jim confronted him and he knew they had his dna he knew he was sunk i dont think he wanted a long court case where he was repeatedly humiliated against the advice of his lawyer he told them everything his sense of honor that he told jim hed work with him his lawyer would advice him to to talk and hed listen and then do it anyway,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhRHJjTnNjUU1pNEVERUZzSWxkdTdtTGVxUkxvU2hHNkNqc005aGRBSnNyNl9iVi1ma1U3ZWhjNXVXQ0Q1eTZadlViZE5fWDNrOXktZjJkZE1aa3U4REE9PQ==

> go back to preferring reallife relationships and interactions sigh every generation seems to say the same thing going back quite a while you arent special im not special the kids arent special there was a point in time people avoided others and they called it reading hysteria and we need to get back to reallife interactions and relationships sound familiar covid showed us extroverts feel deeply entitled to these things and couldnt survive in a world they put introverts through when you bottle these folks up they do all kinds of stupid things theyre even willing to risk getting others hurt or killed just to engage in others because they cant stand it introverts have been dealing with this their entire lives and extroverts couldnt handle it for a small few years because theyve been coddled currently theres a huge social problem with reallife relationships in several countries and honestly i hope it causes a huge decline in birth rates society would rather force things than have uncomfortable conversations especially places like reddit and honestly we brought this on ourselves you act like people will magically just roll things back because of the fantasy of the good old times sound familiar every generation says it for some the internet is their only outlet to meet likeminded people and then there are people like you who genuinely cannot comprehend such a thing youre big mad that people cant be forced back into bars anymore and instead would rather just play video games or read or learn a new skill > maybe the internet dying is the best case scenario at this point for someone with your opinion its wild youre on reddit so much specifically avoiding people nah the internet allowed a group of people an outlet and a shit load of extroverts are bitter about it because they cant guilt people into leaving their house as easily anymore edit oh wow you people think youre special oo ouch suppose history really isnt something taught in schools anymore huh,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ0NkZmcm40cVQ2OEl3NVdYb0dfVG9BTUtZdFNkdEN6VTVKNGhBeWt2SVN2R3dfUXI4TVVOREVUZ1ZQTGktNDVSSjRMSnMtTElqOXpnTDIxUGNPb1dPR2JndjhxbTc4WXp3TS10dWxHZGNyMWc9

hey uvoprosy people are not going to like the <number> minute thing it doesnt matter why i can just share what i saw another documentary do which i thought was a fairly good strategy the yrfatfriend documentary that features aubrey gordon aubrey actually has a background in this kind of communication stuff and she is incredibly passionate about organizing against antifatness a documentary was released where during a set period of time people could watch the movie at half the price or something like that of what it would rent for then based on demand from that cities were selected for both screenings and releases of the film it seems to be gaining momentum and part of the success is the complete upfront communication around the cost and availability etc the website jolt film<url> was their distribution company i think i dont know anything about this and im going to pay for access to your documentary anyway but i think maybe a change of strategy for the general public may be a good idea obviously ignore me if im saying nonsense oh the other thing i liked about the release for the documentary was that there was a tier pricing system they had a we break even price and i think two or three and maybe even a blank option for people who could afford more and wanted to support and now its available to be rented online ive just been watching this campaign and ive found it very informative in terms of strategic engagement thank you for your hard work putting this together i am doing my part and i shall continue witnessing for none of us is free until all of us are free,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ4eDJJSFFrc1pSMURIM3p4bXUzcnpjdEkwSjM3MzlMS0pIb0VJSXZJOTVOcTN4d3h2YW5YUWtoR1hsUWJnUlNaS2dGd2FqZnk3aDZYVGR4NHlJMEF2bUE9PQ==

other than ny and a couple of other seriously large us cities youll find houses with yards which are for the most part larger than their european counterparts why do you think bugs arent as prevalent in european cities as they are in the us its because theres not much natural ground for them to live on,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0aEJ4S2lmU0RMbHk4UmRZcjdySFZOZXh2VTNhMGNIcnhLRVE1Z0tYOXAxSGlLcmY2RlB2aEFiMlUzWE1CanVVX0hFTEJlSXllMG1aMEtocHFMaHBTbWc9PQ==
and youll find them in german cities as well just look at hamburg or freiburg most us cities have bigger plots for each house true but thats for historical reasons there has been a huge shift in european cities taking out parking lots and replacing them with green spaces also we have a lot of parks here in germany and i think in europe in general but having bigger yards doesnt mean the whole city is greener you you do get that right i mean its great that cities in the middle of the desert use up the ground water and dry up rivers to spray the grass lawns of their residents with water if you think that makes the us somehow greener fine also i dont know where you read that us cities have more bugs i couldnt find any source for that its a ridiculous claim anyway cause you guys have vastly different ecosystems over there and you are on a different continent too so there are different bugs anyway my only knowledge to this is that we have fewer bugs all around the world cause of pesticides i even remember having watched a documentary about how some insect catching birds seem to do better in german cities than agricultural fields because of natural spaces in the cities is your so from east germany cause that would explain a lot and i dont mean that as an insult or anything but they just had different city layouts and buildings for some decades and it shows,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0YUZLcmdIakJDT01LU1RNTUs0MVRybVpkYVhURXFxRnoyQmhnZl9YVk9RVUJva1dsQUpYTWc3ODhtb3ZsUHEtNW1qMnR5TXQ4OEo5NkhkUzZoWjZYVzJLUWRsOWg5b3d2a0JWMW1wRnYyYUU9

on top of the other guy bamboo is not just a massive pita to deal with it is also a significant hazard to the surroundings it grows much too fast and pressures other plants out of the niche it is incredibly hard to get rid off i mean that seriously you essentially have to dig up the upper cm of soil completely and without a gap burn it into ash and watch over the barren soil for a year if another bamboo shoots up repeat only when you dont spot any bamboo for a season can you resoil the area if you let bamboo grow unattended dont cut it regularly and dont pay attention for it to not spread to new areas it can become an incredibly dangerous fire hazard it really likes to burn considering its height and tendency to form fastgrowing forests it can spread fires fast between houses and adjacent plants you can even consider it its survival strategy to burn down other plants and then grow faster back than others,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1SHU2ZVBUTUFES0VnSVRQcmd2TTl3VnliZUZTTHo1a3JaR2NWcDFmQnI1OS1BNVVVaVJxVnpLWTFIYXJaSGxVRjBhSEVyb1BBWGpaZ1BEb19LSEx6YXc9PQ==

eh it was some pretty weak evidence that was hammed up for the documentary it didnt actually show that his amygdala was smaller it showed that things that usually elicit a fear response didnt elicit one in him it doesnt mean he doesnt feel fear but its something where he likely was less susceptible to it and has further trained himself to be able to ignore as you have to while free soloing it when necessary,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdrNVc1UFNoMGFzX1pTX1d1SlduczZjc0l1MkhFT1BfV3lDUzh2XzcydVcybVpKRkx6S0poczJkSzZYaXR4WEFfbldacFd2b1VBcGItLUZfSEd4QzZMSWxOQ2hVWlVURjVCR1hWTWJPbEZ3LW89

you obviously have not watched the video as its plain to see in the video one police officer first verbally told him to stop as he was detained he kept walking then another had to guide him to the side and stop him because he was unresponsive to the police officers orders the first time the officer felt something was up and was within his right to order him pout his hands behind his back so that his weapon could be secured before they go any further with verifying any documents and verifying that everything was good but no he had to literally rip himself away and run and pull a fucking gun on these cops full well knowing the situation he was in if you think its ok to do that then i hope you never run in to this situation yourself because your ass would also be toast it seems to mee you have some sort of preconceived bias that you have developed against cops that limit your ability to see this situation objectively for what it is this isnt some rodney king beat down a dude was in the act of unholstering his gun after a confrontation with the cops if you think they are just gonna wait around until he actually pulls it out of his holster to do anything you are delusional and they were <number> within their right to shoot him,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdsRnpLTDIzcnQySFhwMFlXTjBvbDA2VjJ5aW1ROUhCT25MOHB5MkNKWlVsQzd0WkNEOUh4WllUMC14VXc3VDUzT093b003MnhnM0NoMWNtTEpGcVlPVGY2M3F0Z1NzSjJTQWliZ2VwbWVKdnM9

iraq was thought at the time to be a war on terror as a result of <number><number> the us army then maintained a presence in the area after saddams downfall in order to stabilize the area lets make one thing clear what happened in iraq was horrible you can certainly draw parallels between the raping torturing and mental war waged back then the us went there to supposedly fight terrorism take the genocide of kurds for example a key event being halabja this may require some research to understand historically the position the kurds have been in long story short they occupy a region in four countries one being iraq just like palestinians the kurds to this day are persecuted and are actively oppressed in some parts of the region like turkey during saddams regime he indiscriminately and specifically targeted the kurds he bulldozed and bombed villages he displaced people he imprisoned and tortured and raped them inflicted generations of trauma on them thats how its similar to palestine the us wasnt in iraq to do that fucked up as their involvement was netanyahu and israel are doing what happened to the kurds to palestine theyve been doing it for decades this goes back way before october <number> look at a map of palestine since <number> to now and look at how much land was forcibly stripped from palestinians villages bulldozed families leaving in the morning and coming back to find their homes were taken by israelis the nakba and now this past year has been the worst so many palestinians have been displaced and when they finally make it to refugee camps they are targeted there as well reports estimate that more children have been killed in palestine this past year than in four years of world conflict on average and the craziest part is that this is arguably the most welldocumented genocide in history every day there are reports pictures videos so on evidencing what israel is doing a good example is the video of the camp where israeli soldiers or security forces hid a man behind their riot shields and took turns raping him if all of this isnt enough for you to open your eyes and see what israel is doing is wrong i dont know what else to say weve been debating whether its a genocide or not what it should be labeled as is the least important thing and it does not at all change how horrible the situation is,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9RUUlHTGQ0QXZxN0tyaWhaNER3WFQ5SW90S0NsV1kxa1A3YndQeldHMkdIQmMyOUFERDVuWHlmNmxjak1TdFotN2lfVVJpTWVKVGQ2blY4QjcwRlQ3ckE9PQ==

the us is an economic jurisdiction in which the aforementioned lobbies pressure legislators to invite more dependents for the sake of profit and insulation while domestic industry is offshored due to foreigners accesses perhaps the current presidency can be seen as a microcosm or used as a heuristic at least perceptually being that there really isnt one state suggests that there is a leader elected representatives or at the very least a bureaucracy of officials organizing things but you dont know who makes the <number> pages of pork that the well paid legislators vote on within an hour of their introduction and you dont know exactly who are making day to day decisions in the executive if the president is on his th day of vacation while completely senile this is not controversial anymore i think based on the claims of various congressmen and women over the past <number> years or so most recently with thomas massies descriptions of handlers within congress and uhottages simple description of the uss most powerful and monied lobby that its fair to say that the us is a client not a state or client state if you prefer,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aQmpxak5LTG5fWDVJbDFNQ3dlNVUyT2dPSEZVakViNkFRVHlPS1B0N3dPXzdJYm9wMTVMR0VETnNpUkpiN2lnNFlGc05lMS1HQXFIYjdXUlRGWGFfanc9PQ==

nevermind that the israel lobby its foremost organization being at aipac is larger than the military industrial complex in terms of lobby groups in every measure not just the money this explanation from the other poster avoids saying that israel controls the largest slices of american government by suggesting that there is a simple confluence of monied interests in the form of semielected arms dealers >so its basically a win win for the us and israel since israel gets more weapons and the us gets money into their economy so the us gets a shallow rebate on the sale of material goods not the purchase but the sale i give you ten dollars i also give you this squirt gun you give me <cur><number> for the gun i just made <cur><number> winwin for sure this is what the cyclops zionist dan crenshaw said about the matter a few years ago too when he was asked about why the us seems beholden to israel and this was well before they were put in the spotlight with this gaza stuff you can start here<url> and while its not the best article i figure the authoritative source offers some legitimacy congressman thomas massie very recently described how the republican side of congress at least<url> has israeli handlers assigned to everyone but himself cynthia mckinney talked about what happened<url> when she ran into the israel lobby when it came to us policy and israel good rhetoric in the beginning but relevant parts at <number><number> and <number><number> the most expensive house primary in history<url> was entirely the focus of something that isnt the constituency the district it had nothing to do with america thats effectively a foreign nations candidate imagine gaggles of vladimirs and dmitris controlling committee and subcommittee funding through organized groups not registered with fara etc setting record breaking money numbers in the attacking and supporting of house candidates on the explicit basis that their government position is or is not good for a foreign nation and one which operates principally within the relevant institutions of the united states nixon candidly remarked upon his realization that the jews in government were all spies sorry i cant get the clip because every outlet laser focuses on a short out of context and incomplete phrase that suggests nixon was simply targeting jews for no apparent reason he describes the jewish lobby<url> okay look thats not me saying it thats not some weird altright political commentator or catholic pseudo fascist zealot or some shit consider what he says privately and candidly and as compared perhaps to how he says it publicly i think that immense evidentiary weight has to be afforded to those closest to the events and considering the candid nature of the first clip things seem kinda spooky i look at the project for a new american century and the clean break memo and look at who is involved in that and its not the ceo of haliburton but a bunch of zionists well i dont know that theyre zionists necessarily but the term is trending and if i said there was a pattern of jewry it would elicit memories of hitler but hey according to others this happens because people like nikki hailey or some shit form a revolving door between congress and lockheed martin and the handful of them are able to influence to the point of total control the rest of congress because they like money and for some reason this particular israeli avenue is the best source of it not for especially untoward reasons but because like arms dealing or whatever the tail is not wagging the dog according to uliorza in fact the dog wags the tail and theres nothing more to consider you can look up the last two spies that were ever executed in the us and at this point maybe start to form an assumption about why we stopped doing that and started legalizing espionage and corruption instead,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTBySXJtUm1BNUZyNUtSNV9UaFFpaTNQa3JYcFNoUVJtRWhXV21TNjF3ZjFfZFFSVnFjbFVXVFRBaUR2NWZxRm1RNldGS2JBM2ZLYm53WUdVWTBoZnM0aVE9PQ==

re likud charteri in no way agree with this ive been antinetanyahu for well over a decade before most people even knew his name because he has done nothing but sabotage any prospect for peace river to the sea from anyone is disgusting >its not only disingenuous to present from the river to the sea palestine will be free as a call to genocide but its also extremely hypocritical anyway this slogan being genocidal is purely your interpretation others view it as a genuine call for freedom and as call to end the oppression theres nothing inherent in it that is violent towards jews the english slogan comes from the arabic original still chanted today which translates to from the river to the sea palestine will be arab it is an explicitly genocidal call that protesters in the west are unaware of this and just find the rhyme catchy does not matterthey are promoting an explicitly genocidal call and cause >hamas isnt the root problem as much as youd like to believe it we can analyze the <number> years before they were founded and see how palestinians were constantly uprooted and denied basic rights by israel we can also look at how things are looking the palestinian authority governed wb hamas was founded in <number> so if were using the <number> years before then were reverting back to the original sin of israeli independence at which time the west bank was arabcontrolled territory that participated in the intended war of destruction that turned out to be israels war of independence the original attempt of making the river to the sea arab they declared a war of annihilation on israel even when the land was theirs exclusively so its pretty rich to suggest that opposition began with israels control of the land >presenting arabs as inherently genocidal towards jews is also bad faith considering that jews lived in large numbers for thousands of years amongst arabs youre right they were only genocidal towards jews once the jews had a state which doesnt really have anything to do with the unaffiliated mizrahi jews where were living in iraq yemen lebanon syria egypt etc who were all expelled violently per previous comment current jewish population in most of those is in the single digits and to suggest that there was peaceful coexistence which you are not stating explicitly but implying is likewise disingenuous given the degeneration of jews as dhimmis to antisemitic violencefrequent pogroms <url>in the <number>+ years before israels founding as they embraced their jewish identity >you also have <number> arabs in your country who could genuinely destroy it or cause irreversible damage if they were really genocidal i think the palestinian citizens of israel are the best demonstration to how palestinians can be genuinely peaceful and cooperative if theyre given more breathing room its a shame that israel doesnt see that and learn from that anyway no one is telling you to live under arab rule just to let palestinians breathe a bit not my country and ill flip your argument on its head palestinians in israel are peaceful and cooperative because they are free israelis who arent brainwashed and led by radical islamic jihadism when palestinians are peaceful there is no cause for suppression or violence but rather integration when they are violent they are met with violence and isolation which is not just an israeli phenomenonsee jordan egypt lebanon in point of fact if youll read israels declaration of independence it explicitly welcomes arabs to live in israel in peace >anyway no one is telling you to live under arab rule just to let palestinians breathe a bit i wish that were the case from the river to the sea is a clear and explicit call to have jews live and mostly die under arab rule palestinians deserve more than just to breathe a bit as im sure you know the deserve full liberation freedom dignity peace safety and the pursuit of happiness unfortunately they which is to say their leadership and the terrorists who support them always choose suicidal violence and those actions are always met with greater violence so nothing can happen until hamas is defeated and extremism eliminated,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0Tkl5MWNHX2xvd053ZTd1d29PMEFqbW9Lc3ZDZ1l1SkNWUllVYmFvbWFNYk9acFFBd1NidWZwWVk1U1lGbkk4em5RRldIcjFHTHJtZ0hrWTVuYXRPOEFCR2RHRzBqeWctZWNqckk2S2JxMnM9

>the english slogan comes from the arabic original still chanted today which translates to from the river to the sea palestine will be arab it is an explicitly genocidal call that protesters in the west are unaware of this and just find the rhyme catchy does not matterthey are promoting an explicitly genocidal call and cause bullshit the original slogan is min alnahr ila albahr filastin satakun hurrah which translates to from the river to the sea palestine will be free some arab nationalists and islamic nationalists used variations of this slogan later but this isnt the original nor the popular form of the slogan take it from israelhayom a rightwing israeli newspaper <url> >the original arabic slogan min alnahr ila albahr filastin satakun hurrah translates to from the river to the sea palestine will be free >hamas was founded in <number> so if were using the <number> years before then were reverting back to the original sin of israeli independence at which time the west bank was arabcontrolled territory that participated in the intended war of destruction that turned out to be israels war of independence the original attempt of making the river to the sea arab >they declared a war of annihilation on israel even when the land was theirs exclusively so its pretty rich to suggest that opposition began with israels control of the land we can look at how israel treated arabs within the <number> ceasefire line after israel was founded and when palestinians were incapacitated and had no political leadership neither hamas nor the plo existed back then yet military ghettos absentee properties theft even of people living inside the green line happened at a massive scale examples of massacres against helpless palestinians include the kafr qassim massacre<url> israel ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of palestinians during the nakba before the surrounding arab states intervened plan dalet came before surrounding arab states intervened and israel had already depopulated approximately <number> villages by the time that happened >palestinians in israel are peaceful and cooperative because they are free israelis who arent brainwashed and led by radical islamic jihadism when palestinians are peaceful there is no cause for suppression or violence but rather integration when they are violent they are met with violence and isolation which is not just an israeli phenomenonsee jordan egypt lebanon well then why doesnt israel try to integrate more palestinians its because they care more about being a jewish ethnostate than being a democracy > unfortunately they which is to say their leadership and the terrorists who support them always choose suicidal violence and those actions are always met with greater violence so nothing can happen until hamas is defeated and extremism eliminated already debunked by the fact that palestinians have been getting continuously screwed regardless of their leadership and regardless of their politics we had a period between <number> and <number> were there was no hamas and no plo and no leadership it was still a brutal apartheid regime and helpless palestinian civilians were still ethnically cleansed,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1dGpoTS1XWFBUOTdXel9zNHlzZmhuNTZMcGNyeE44WVJZSVgzWXFSajdJbmx3SE5YeHhDdnh1MEp4aVo2S05uN1MxMG9HNV9aR0tuUENCMjRWX25TSFE9PQ==

a loved one was recently buried in the same cemetery as a group of the columbine victims the victims are buried in a halfcircle of tall black crosses in grassy island in the back of the cemetery separate from everyone else out of respect but also because any surrounding plots would be unsellable even with the care that went into planning their resting place it stills feel like impossibly not enough that this couldnt be it but for such a heinous tragedy but what would be enough one of the killers is also buried there in a markerless grave i suppose i can understand the cemetery giving the parents that bit of grace but the most i would have offered was cremation like others have said true crime journalists have found every way to subtly valorize these vile young men often through the thinveil of wellintentioned pop psychology but the killers do deserve not that and i suspect the journalists have blood on their hands for perpetuating their legends the collective memory of the killers like their bodies deserves a markerless grave at best,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAxejRLTHozWVI3bW5WeGk5SWgyeFBld0xQNVQwQUo5WEZtWjRPd2NHV1B2cUMxS2xIVnM2SW0zTnFWYmZPelJ5WXNiT2V1MWFLZU02OUpORWIyU0xYT3c9PQ==

no they would be correct if were being technically accurate there are <number> planets and as many as <number> dwarf planets in the kuiper belt and possibly upwards of <number> beyond the kuiper belt for little kids learning about the solar system theres a limit to what we expect them to know and memorize in the strictest sense dwarf planets are not planets in this context putting dwarf in front of the term does not mean it gets to be included in the planet category if pluto is a planet then so is eris and sedna and quaoar and haumea and for that matter ceres eris is <number> larger than pluto for example the problem though is that all of these have not cleared their orbits and their orbits can cross one another to astronomers this was a problem because when categorizing things you clearly have the planets we knew about prior to plutos discovery and then we have all the other objects that are a lot like pluto and not at all like the the big round things that clear their orbits so if pluto is a planet then we cant be sure about the number of planets there are in our solar system were still finding new transneptunian objects,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkbHUzTWhNNUgyQlN5NVRPeEFJMndrXzNVR1FMZ041OWFzeGhlMWFMV0RndEVEWW1kWG5BNlY3MnQxZk5GOVJ5Q0RGTGtzZk5HeEFhdm5wSThIdXlpQVE9PQ==

i dont know how many dwarf planets there are off hand but sure i think the crux of the issue is that people want a hard definition of the number of planets for some reason but our solar system has so much more going on that just being like oh <number> things is so dismissive but that is where the entire drama around pluto starts,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkTklWc2F0c2x3OEp3RVlrY1BSamcxZkJCYzV1Q1E1Q1dZaHVYcUVqLWJhX1RKZDNxTEkxMmZMYjVhQ2VWWktKeTM0UUVBYk94SGtObE1hTi1LTU9LSWc9PQ==

totally irrelevant to my point the historical claim was that the population grew too large for the island they destroyed all their natural resources and suffered a massive population collapse as a direct result before being discovered by europeans theres no doubt that that the slave trade impacted them but thats totally irrelevant to the point these were people of polynesian descent who also apparently reached the western coast of south america around the th century plus or minus a hundred years or so themselves via exploration in addition to the article i linked above regarding the genetics involved theyve also recently released geologic surveying which undermine the ecocide theory again im not debating whether a good chunk of the population was enslaved at some point but that isnt relevant at all to the issue of ecological collapse since the slavery abductions didnt happen until the dutch started kidnapping people in the th century and the alleged ecological collapse happened before the dutch discovered the island,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3Frbml1b2dUZnpjdEJ2ZmQ2SG91V19URFptUkdyV0FnX1dNUE56d0tra0x5U0xSel9xMnpqSk9rMjNOcFhuZHRQbjR5V0pwNllVd0NWLVAzZ3ZwX01yM3c9PQ==

saw that recently super interesting ive always thought the concept of rapa nuiinduced ecocide was dubious i do believe though that the population numbers suffered greatly during those periods prearrival of the europeans there are first hand accounts from the likes of james cook that suggest a small suffering society that alongside the folklore you hear on the island the very little documented information and the obvious loss of faith in mana and their spiritual beliefs leads me to believe that the population did significantly decrease during a time of hardship but not by means of ecocide as always i could be completely wrong but it definitely makes for an interesting conversation,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FsOWxPeFdvMEdsWGdDYmdGNVA3YURIV0NFMFBuVTAyLWdfa1VyS19RRWNXS0JYbkVGcF9Qa3lhbHdlNFRjY1JlVkxqY0Rybkd4MlJMNzNFeFpkM0ZpMmc9PQ==

yeah i found this article<url> from zoe daniel before she became an mp fascinating especially as someone who doesnt tend to pay too much attention to whats going on in america she talks about the cultural differences between us and the us in terms of how we dealt with covid and how australias priority of safeguarding the community as a whole made australia look like some authoritarian hellhole to conservative americans and apparently the fairly liberal nyt<url> because american society is way more fixated on maintaining freedom at an individual level even if that means society as a whole suffers whereas australian society has generally been more about whats good for the community as a whole and as the title suggests it was a weird time when the yanks were saying australians are the crazy ones when normally its the other way around,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnS25rWGNla2JJbmZPWUZ0MHFsNTBwNGxyeGFmM0NaT2JHQkp1a1Y3eHppZ1hjbHpKZkVjMFFiT2pnRGl5a1BRM3RfRDVkNkg2QkgwUWoyLUtxX3V4Z2xOSDJNdFJpa1JoUWpBUGxfY0xDOGs9

the vaccine that trump takes credit for creating that was rolled out during his administration and he asked his followers to take at his rallys how does that have anything to do with liberals you know the country locked down under trump during covid right the hunter biden laptop what of it nothing came from that and its never even been proven to be his why are you acting like its some gotcha the mueller report did not prove trump didnt benefit from russian collision like you seem to think it did mueller spent almost <number> pages describing numerous links between the russian government and the trump campaign he found that a russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate donald j trump and disparaged presidential candidate hillary clinton he also found that a russian intelligence service conducted computerintrusion operations against the clinton campaign and then released stolen documents while mueller was unable to establish a conspiracy between members of the trump campaign and the russians involved in this activity he made it clear that a statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts in fact mueller also wrote that the investigation established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts if the election was stolen why did every study and lawsuit prove otherwise and dems and repubs looked into them with even trump appointed judges ruling over them so you cant just claim liberal corruption eight wellknown republican attorneys judges and politicians say they want conservatives in particular to know the <number> election wasnt stolen former president donald trump lost theyve published a report called lost not stolen which reexamines the lawsuits filed by trump and his supporters calling for election results to be overturned in six tightly contested battleground states pennsylvania arizona georgia michigan nevada and wisconsin the lost not stolen report says trumps failed legal challenges should inspire more trust in our election security david hoppe contributed to the report he served as former chief of staff to two republican congressional majority leaders and has decades of legal experience in dc im certainly not a nevertrumper i voted for donald trump twice for president if the evidence had said there was something wrong with this election and it was stolen we would have said that hoppe said we looked through the evidence and it didnt add up it was woefully deficient as a matter of fact hoppe said conservatives should prioritize stopping the spread of trumps electionfraud lies over partisan politics calling the security of our elections absolutely critical to both people wanting to vote and to having fair elections former president donald trump claims millions of illegal votes cost him the <number> election however all but three of his <number> election challenges failed trumps lawsuits included claims of voter fraud illegal polling procedures and errors with ballots and voting machines that would invalidate the <number> election results he pulled out of <number> cases <number> were dismissed by federal judges including democratic and republican appointees of those at least eight were appointed by trump,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna1Yta3VZWVR2ZWVzZThZbkZZc2J3Y0daS2tzWm41V3g5aVYzZjFFT3pBU3FwT0ZpYVY5c3U2VldOeXcySXA4UXNyWTlFTUF3MEF0MnoyQk55dkh2OWc9PQ==

im familiar with the quote and stand by everything i said he didnt make it its not technically his plan and there are parts of it that dont align with his own plans and positions he doesnt care about abortion or preserving traditional marriage like they do for instance ultimately that doesnt make much of a difference though and its still a major concern theres still a lot of stuff that will cause a lot of damage if he gets a second administration but thats why i think its important to go ahead and inject a little bit of nuance to the discussion for the sake of the handful of people who otherwise will see the push against the project as bunch of exaggerated fearmongering and conspiracy theories,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoZU9JTGc1QVdoQm9iR2hkTm1vMXZXVGtxWDBQZGhZQk1aeGNGNFJoTzlhOHZuTkpKM0RYamN4VXh0NjR0WkFTT3FkVzdqYTc1VG9WOTVCd3c5X2E2Y1E9PQ==

i totally agree with you i havent watched the movie in years and im now just noticing your comment is <number>+ years old but the play he wrote about a kid killing himself was just so telling to me the way he thought everyone would come together and talk about how wonderful he was came off as such an odd thing i generally think he desired that kinda of love and devotion from friends and family that his family gave to his dead uncle who also committed suicide for whatever reason he seemed to become fascinated with suicide death and the attention it would bring his parents seemed like such loving and caring people too so i say this without judging them i think their wealth and overprotectiveness hurt ethan in the end anytime he got in trouble had a bad day misbehaved or acted out he could use suicidal thoughts or ideations as a means to get out of trouble or to get more love attention from his parents,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpUllDRWJJLTF2cG5OaXZCSWlEUC1JX1YtQ2Zld2ctY1lHWEdGZnd3T2VEYk1zUkFkb1l2WThhLWRrbWY5SkxZc1pvSnVRWEJpa29NbWdOTHQ0bVZSRXc9PQ==

this is an appeal to authority fallacy you should try to defer to authority on say the position of the sun the earths shape quantum physics and mathematics so on and so forth but when youre talking about the arts youre not going to find some objective paragon of understanding you will find someone who can attempt to make rather bold claims about why picasso and monet pale in comparison to van eyck but at a certain point you have to make a personal decision that is one understanding of art it is making meaning within yourself based off the creative input of others and if you think monet is more beautiful then you do no amount of philosophizing is going to change your mind unless you decide to that is the crux of the issue with this argument in my time in academia ive read some rather bold and illuminating things ive also read some pure brain rot from people claiming to specialize in their fields just look at shakespeare criticism for that you will see some seemingly smart people purport complete and utter nonsense with confirmation bias,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpWE84N1lvVi1IRFNfNmJMUlFob3BXOTBkOEFReEdwaU5WbXlRYl9tQ0pmSkJtc2JvR0txSk12ZGNTZ3UxeThLR1BXTVdJYXZ3TTZ4dVJYVDE1REZ1TnNJcUNCRjQwVWV6MExzNHN2enVvNlE9
because the argument is always this doomer mentality that we used to have great music movies books art so on and so forth but then it all came crashing down it is no more the end of art arrived the moment rich guys could not paint photo realism for kings yet at the heart of this is usually people that stopped genuinely searching for art they love years prior there are genuine discussions to be had about the state of music film books and all forms of media ip cinema being too overdone is definitely a cinema conversation but does that really mean there are no good movies the top <number> hits may be too homogenous but does that mean theres no good music the problem is one of self discovery in a world saturated with art too many people choose the pessimistic view theres too much and the thing i like isnt here well then go on that journey and find it my friend find that guy still doing old jazz and the painter still doing renaissance realism it is surely out there and we tend to forget that art is about sparking our creative drive to try and make meaning it is a collaborative effort with your experiences so you may hate the garage band guys that sound too much like led zeppelin or something again though i promise you that you can find good music while other people explore their artistry all you are seeing is a world with so much hope for artists and instead of embracing this world you crave the remnants of one already passed do you have any idea how many terrible artists probably existed in the <number>s you can still read plays that are frankly quite terrible but somehow survived hell even the <number>s wasnt all bangers hits and the best movies ever made you ever watch shanghai surprise our tendency to create golden ages stops us from appreciating what we have we are the apex of history where we can access the golden era of every generation before us and still embrace our own you just gotta start go find great art internalize it make it sing within the song of yourself,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpX01BRGlpN3pQODlIUjlVOGxzdUJuTkFRUkJxMGdyM2ZUQkNBb0lXQUY5dGRVTXhRT3EyUkhObFFlOVRCa3FxemlFWUdsRXpsWnhscnIwejZUNG1IOGlkMk9TellGX3FlNllDTk1mbTF3RG89

my personal view on voting third party in this election is this yeah rfk isnt going to win we know this however i think <number> of the us agrees that the two party system needs to be changed nobody really wants either trump or biden so if enough people vote third party in this election there is a possibility that the party system can be changed down the road,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqTkoxQURjdnJ5WlJkZ2xoVlF1eUV0ZGt1Und0dF9hcTlWY2swWTlsdkxYcHpUNVF5SkhER1VuZG1lWnJMcEIydExrb1lMT2xWV2FrSW5XOERyaFE4UXc9PQ==

i think saying <number> is very optimistic if a third party gets enough of a then theyre only going to be viewed as a spoiler regardless of who won the other side will view them as a spoiler rfk is not a good representation of a third party you may like and agree with him but to most americans hes a bit crazy if third party candidates want to do away with fptp and get representation then they need to work from the ground up why should i vote for some party that has little to no representation in government some of these third parties have no positions or maybe a handful of local government positions in the entire country then every four years they come around and want to be elected to the highest position without doing the groundwork first if you want to do away with the two party system you need to find and vote for third parties from the ground up not for president its like coming out of college and applying to be the ceo of a major corporation,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqR1lIcU96Wml0b1dLNDV5TFJVSU5qbE5RRjNiWU10NEJtdVVZREJ5dzFIc1ZsRTNJNDczRU4zLTJFQktMWnhoWFNzTXptdFRWSHAxYW9Xb256bjUweFE9PQ==

antifa although inspired by the term antifascist in its political usage is not a synonym to it originally in the interwar period it was a group formed by the german communist party officially called antifascist action more importantly at the time the term fascist for marxistleninists included all capitalist countries and their political parties not just farright groups like the fascist party in italy or germanys own nazis in fact even the german socialdemocratic party was considered fascist by the communists the term socialfascist was used specifically for them and other socialdemocratic parties which by the way in the era were still marxist albeit trying to operate within the liberal democratic framework nevertheless the original antifa organization became defunct when the nazi came to power and managed to establish their dictatorship postwar antifa are a combination of farleft or hardleft if you want to use a euphemism groups some of them militant who use the symbols of the original antifa organization of the interwar german communist party but have no direct connection to it antifa today is mostly seen as a movement of various farleft groups including both communists and anarchists who have little if any direct connection or cooperation between different countries even regions within states edit cope and after you are done coping go read a book hell even a wikipedia article would help,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqUmt0SnVmVVNxZWtmVHRKalNwVlRMaDNPUWdLQ092ZzNIUWpDeWRueVBVUEFUaXdBQ3liMHNHMVFiWWc5d055N2JNVVFvOGZzS21rck9aQ2N2d3NIMlE9PQ==

youre actually describing tactics used by antifascist groups antifa isnt just fighting white supremacists in the streets and imo violence is unproductive in all but the most extreme circumstances clashing with brownshirts doesnt counter root drivers of fascist organizing and it tends towards the exclusion of women in the antifascist movement the social ostracization techniques you describe are much more common normal people dont want to live near a fascist and they dont want to work with one leftists identify and doxx people with violent altright views<url> to impose social and financial punishments on them which also threatens closetedfascists to renounce those views antifascists damage the property of people and businesses who platform altright figureheads and influencers make it unprofitable to provide infrastructural support for fascists even mainstream civil action against fascists like the defamation lawsuit of alex jones could be considered part of antifa thought these are all very roundabout ways of countering fascist organizing and suppressing fascist thought though again the ultimate goal is to destroy fascism at the root allowing fascist speech to flow freely through the discourse is the first false step towards allowing fascists to propagandize indoctrinate and grow a support base of followers whod otherwise hold acceptable moderately conservative views rather than leaving the job of crushing the altright to a disparate disorganized collective of weakly linked antifascist groups it would be more effective to adapt the free speech right to accommodate an exception and bring the full force of the legal system to eliminate any nascent fascist movements,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqRk9JMzlEOFpHNEE1Z2YxU1p4WEV4SlFQdVBqUFBTdXhrb29Fb2E2dGpSdXZGeEIwOXV4bG1CNGhTbTNvZmlLeVdyTVZGN1hxSVh1cmVOa3h2dmM4c3c9PQ==

i agree with you generally and i especially agree that violence is unethical i just dont think giving fascists the freedom to speak publicly is the most effective defense against fascism before the internet i mightve thought differently but because information spread is so much faster and so much more decentralized on the internet compared to traditional media any propaganda strategy that doesnt use the internet on some level is doomed to failure imo its part of why were seeing a resurgence of radical ideas breaking into the mainstream the silverlining is that each much easier for a security agency to do surveillance on the internet compared to in the field the physical world i think its possible to censor ideas such that fascists cant organize over the internet and i think its possible to do that without completely banning historical racistantisemiticsexist texts which still have academic value part of my own pacifism is believing that people arent inherently evil that nasty ideology isnt something theyre born with or even necessarily taught by their parents sure upbringing plays a significant role in determining the scope of someones beliefs but i think when people embrace a brand of farright ideology they first fell into that hole by seeking answers in good faith and being lied to by a propagandist people should be shielded from such grifters and zealots if possible both for their own protection and the protection of those the ideology victimizes,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqbTVkVmRabkRGTjQzM21ZUkI4OGY1OVdpMkV0M19mbDl0Q09ZVkpQUGc4R1o3MWVydWxqRGQ4enBENXdNbHBmUEtNYUpuYklYQndXaFZhZTh4c2FVdGc9PQ==

what are you even talking about first i am not a conservative so i dont have to hide behind anything or whatever you have in your mind secondly if you cannot understand the difference behind the hard or radical left or whatever euphemism you want to use their extremist ideology and actions and actual liberals then maybe you were not a liberal in the first place also as i mentioned in another comment when the original antifa organization was founded by the german communist party communists following the dictates of the kremlin considered anyone who was not them fascist including liberals and socialdemocrats who at the time were still marxist just not of the leninist variety i would bet that even most contemporary leftists would have a similar point of view towards liberals and socialdemocrats who do not kowtow to their dogmatism nevertheless as far as modern antifa are concerned there is nothing different between them and the various farright and trumpist hacks who themselves hide behind terms like conservative or patriot all these militant or wannabe ones leftists who claim to be antifascist are anything but they use violence and propaganda to promote their own radical politics and they are not really any different than the fascists of the opposite political spectrum they are just opposite sides of the same coin cope ps and by the way i did not want to mention it in your original comment this isnt the place for political takes but since you started it the hard left that you mentioned were also pretty fine with cooperating with fascists and nazis when they thought it would be to their favour ask the polish or anyone from the baltics if you are interested,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyNUwxazhmdHpYa1FQSGliT0JOQVNuMFZnUGxsblR3dUduOGVVTG1aMUl4MVVuaXVFcDRtMzdSLVhKQ1pfeTVoUi0yRm9YS0FlXzRnZktzM0NwVG9OSXc9PQ==

not necessarily taking a stance on this but all of the us territories are colonies or military outposts with influence so outsized they might as well be hawaii surpassed its status as a colony to actually become a state but there are a hell of a lot of people who would like to see hawaiians in control of their own islands it could be worse puerto ricans cant vote in federal elections and have no representation in congress despite puerto rico having a larger population than almost <number> of the states quick google said the population is between ct and ut remember the thirteen original colonies no taxation without representation puerto rico is in the same circumstances that led to the american revolution except their overseer is infinitely more powerful and incredibly close by the only avenues it has to selfgovernance are becoming a state which is not likely to happen because it would require a massive power grab by the democrats something only the republicans have shown the balls complete disregard for civil society and the rule of law to try especially if coupled with dc statehood or some kind of catastrophe that would make the country permanently unprofitable the us uses subtler forms of influence than creating a physical colony nowadays but we are definitely colonizers and its not unpatriotic to admit as much in a world where the union would actually let hawaii secede it would still be difficult to uncouple from the biggest money fountain in history that would be political and economic suicide it would be like the uk leaving the european union absolute stupidity,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzS1ljd09yamhLTHJkS2ZGeloxclIzTi1aVUF2bmtrMmxpMV9BQVgyYVdBNWdpOV9mZlNTMHktekw4LWVNdVVkdUhRY2JDMzJlU01udF9HUEdwNU5Pb1E9PQ==

in <number> <number> out of every <number> people in the ussr was arrested and sent to a gulag under stalins rule mass amnesties during ww brought more than a million of those from prison to the front lines against the germans where they were issued one rifle per <number> soldiers the soviet system has always had a very different perception of the value of a human life and specifically a disregard for jewish lives the antisemite stalins rule did its absolute best to remove any humanity left from the russian people they were forced to be brutal simply to survive the gulags became a crossroads where the best of persecuted humanity and the worst of violent humanity met and fought to the death with highly predictable results <url> over the next <number> years the soviet system cleared the gulags a few times because religious leaders often substitute as a defacto government inside of lawless prisons and because judaism was one of the predominate religions in russia and eastern europe the statistical crossover was anyone brutal enough to survive long enough to rule rose to power in the closed gulag ecosystem a psychopath is more than willing to hide their psychopathy behind legitimate religion or simply kill a man for his hat and identity psychopathy is broadly defined as the lack of empathy stalins gulags just accelerated refining psychopathy with brutal darwinian efficiency the newly formed religious state of israel received a statistically large share of these men from the soviet union there they networked in the internment camps before some stayed and rose to positions of power inside the new community of israel and some migrated to europe and brighton beach in new york this is a repeating pattern up into the <number>s and <number>s when most of the us based ones rebranded themselves as russian oligarchs because they found it easier to get girlstrap prey that way in america <url> <url> as the soviet union failed and perestroika went into full effect the oligarchy systematically stole everything so effectively that non psychopathic russians were using bricks as their stable currency in new york these networks would begin using trump towers and casinos to launder stolen russian mob money into the us <url> but now you start to see the nexus of transnational organized crime and money laundering between russia and the us statistically carries the same <number> passports united states israeli and russian <url> <url> <url> the reason this is breaking down now is because russia whose government was overtaken by the mob decades ago used the same network to interfere with elections around the world that it used for laundering stolen money facebook was used to encourage brexit to cut uk support away from europe because over a decade ukraines push towards european integration threatened to expose a money laundering operation that putin has spent almost half a century building cambridge analytica nigel farage and steve bannon critically dovetail into that as well <url> epstein specifically targeted prince andrew because he was the weak link in the royal chain thats kgb kompromat methodology that was repeated with trump since the days of ray cohn his mentor and the early russian trump hotel miss universe pageants the pee tapes etc all the way through lindsay grahams repressed homosexuality trips to moscow etc facebook was also used primarily by prigozihns internet research agency ira they went so far as to send young newly recruited russian internet trolls on expenses paid tours around the us so they could more effectively imitate mommy bloggers and nd amendment enthusiasts online to sway the <number> election to the us candidate they had the most control over trump wikipediahttpsenmwikipediaorg wikifacebookcambridge analytica data scandal <url> the russian cozy bearfancy bear hacks and manipulation of the <number> dnc primaries were necessary to keep bernie sanders out of the finals simply because russia and israel have no kompromatcontrol over him <url> sheldon and miriam adelson were tapped by israeli intelligence which was being controlled by or at least feeding intel to russian intelligence via the multi generational network of russian jewish families to run an influence operation across the united states political spectrum its so much easier to grow a kleptocracy by investment in tech yuri milnerdst dmitriev brin etc than by a ground war but it leaves a very distinct trail when you compare the differentials of the two <url> when <number> years of russian mob money laundering gets outed at the endpoints trump and netanyahus respective corruption trials things start to break down quickly the russian mobgovernment planned on stealing the us economy in an american version of perestroika im not sure it was a grand sinister plan as much as the result of systemic governmental corruption and ridiculous silicon valley valuations overlaid on commercial real estate speculation but the results are the same too big to fail does not apply at this level of corruption the cancer simply overtakes the host and western democracy then humanity dies this closed loop ecosystem of cancerous corruption is just a larger scale model of the gulags that preceded it it just required altering the new online reality to keep people oblivious until it was done its effectively the kgbs soviet era surveillance state kompromat intimidation and mind control from putins formidable years in the kgb cross bred with the video game grand theft auto in the digital

ukraines jewish nazis as putin likes to call them standing up to a bully destroyed the kleptocrats cover because they broke the code when the putin loyal oligarch kolomoisky was arrested in ukraine for corruption it cracked the trumpputin money laundering channel <url> <url> <url> to quote the late john mccain russian is a gas station run by the mob sometimes the work is for their own mob monopoly and sometimes they do shady work for hire the ccp needed <number> things to be able to replace the usd with a programmable reserve currency of their own and destroy freedom of press and western democracy forever grain and microprocessors putin promised xi ukraine in <number> days during the first week of the olympics so that xi would have the grain and supply chain lock neon to take taiwan and tsmc without putting m of the poorest chinese into famine now <number> years into a <number> day war russia desperately needed shahed drones and gave iran the intel it then gave to hamas for the oct <number> attacks the governments of russia china and iran need their kleptocracy to stay dark for their corrupt business models to survive trump netanyahu and mbs do as well the reason its all strange bedfellows is because sorting by nationality is their traditional tool to keep all of us fighting so they can hide their grift from the masses ignore nationality and religion sort by psychopathy and net worth the results are exponentially more accurate ukraine and gaza are both genocides with a primary purpose of obfuscating mob corruption inside these government networks the separation of church and state was a preemptive caution against what is happening right now kleptocracy cares about neither and will use both with abandon to further its insatiable singular goal greed is nothing if not predictable,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzdFRzVVZOZ19pNDEtOXA1Qm4tOGJWaTZyV3BOWm9Yc3VrYmxEUXFMVTRCeHNEa243RVlFYnZRTVA5RUpGWWIxRkNnaUx2TmRwUDljSGNlbVNEZnJ6Zkpsdy1BRGYtVW1jbjdJeHZ4b0g5WmM9

thats your corruption two candidates during a primary made a deal with each other in a primary where biden was already beating bernie like dont get me wrong i voted for bernie in both of the primaries he was in but with the progressive vote split between him and warren there was just no chance he was going to win the <number> primaries there was no conspiracy to get him to lose progressives just decided theyd rather have neither of them win instead of swallowing their pride and voting for one progressive as a block they didnt want a progressive to win they wanted their candidate to win and no one else kind of like what youre doing with biden and trump,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN1RnRwTjV2djFBTE1tRUEyZUR4UXN1TW5wZ1NQMGlwTEJuaTBrV3dJV1VEVXNOUlQxTHhoMkhjcmx4ZXk0S0hrb0lLdExJMEZJVGFCbHFmbVBaNUZrOWc9PQ==

boy listening to people like chad wolf or sebastian gorka speak is a real reminder of just how completely the gop has become utterly devoid of intellectuals after years of purging it literally is just these flunkies left bannon navarro manafort stone kid rock et al of all of the parallels made with the rise of the nazis in germany the sheer unconflicted stupidity of the party intelligentsia is among the most persistent it may be a bit outside the scope of the film but one really cant properly describe the maga movement without getting into americas deeply malignant antigovernment movement whichin its most recent tea party iterationsupplied maga with its simplistic racist extremist violent ideological foundation like everything else in trumps life it was already there and he just parasitized and amplified it its a bit incomplete to say that trump loyalists want a totalitarian regime because they in fact have no coherent theory of government just that all government is bad government is good if it has killing bad guys as its sole duty and justification and democracy is a weak artificial disguise of human evil that must eventually succumb to the supremacy of gunfire too still the films conclusion is accurate the enchantment the vote from the rooftop crowd feels for their hero trump isnt only a cult of personality but an expression of a broad deep and sincere renunciation of the countrys founding principles,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2UE03MzU3SVRNNGtBN2tfX1ROR1ZjVjlhekFTRGhxdmtGZUZuOGVWRWZnZnhVZzdUWHB0VmozclFrWjVfZ211MmZidy0xcjlFRkdQLXo4bzZrVml0Wmc9PQ==
