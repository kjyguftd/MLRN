ive seen these things before they talk up the aircraft and camera and its quality advertise images of a dji or skydio or similar product sell it at a toy drone price under the tag of special offer or some other such false claim then what you get is nothing anywhere near what they claim it is this is a bait and switch scam and they get away with it because they are sending them from india so our laws cant do anything about them we really need to crack down on these kinds of ads by barring companies that do things like this i am a fan of strong corporate competition and not a fan of specific product bans based on nation of origin but i am a fan of banning dishonest companies from the market as they are bad for the industry in general and there are a couple of companies out of india that do produce quality uavs but they sell commercial not consumer drones do not sell them at knock off bait and switch prices like this company nor will they sell them through knock off sites like that one is sold on,r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMzhiY1lJSXNnVFRKSDZOamJNTUtBNUxkN0JpcVBlcHZ5cUtqTHBNNVBRcWJwU0xIdGhaZ2dWT3dHdkNESTdHazQ5elFET21ZNHpvQ2R4ZFVVMnZKTjk3NlJsZG9pdFl3aWNJeXl4SW51YVk9

best practice for safety right after takeoff is to test controls and signal by flying <number> ft high and just go back and forth maybe loop around for a minute or so in case there is any connectivity issue for beginning flights do not lose eye contact with the drone best to have a friend with you to spot it until you figure out your ranges fly in wide open spaces if you can as going beyond large structures hills etc will effect your signal if you lose signal let go of the controls so the drone will stop hold the controller up in the air and run in the direction of the drone until you get signal back,r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM2hMNk80aXpZWmZOOVotRWxiOFRTdEZfS0dPUkxSNE01VGRxNVlhWkVNMjlfSWZ4eTZBc3lNWmZobzRyM0xveGRqaU1scVBSNDBZMkJDbmtHN0syQkE9PQ==

the issue with that is that inspections after an unexpected loss can be difficult to schedule and frequently customers will cancel a visit last minute this leads to delays in getting accurate quotes and extends the time it takes to close an open claim our company prides itself on the work we do and the customer service we provide the more outside parties we have to depend on the more likely service will not be up to our standards the cost of licensing and training drone operators and the costs of the drones arent too expensive but id prefer not to buy multiple models to try to figure out what will work for us,r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaDVIZUhCS0czQjB2WVE0VTh4cHppaElYNjBTdXpsXzVncFlUREtWbWY5MlRvNzY2aUtTZnRFLUJWN0Z0YjJjRkx2SXZJTEtRUmtkSDI3SDh3bHlST2c9PQ==
