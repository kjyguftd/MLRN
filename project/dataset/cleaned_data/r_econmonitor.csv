i hope youll forgive a question about something basic in the recent fed statement they said theyre keeping interest rates the same while continuing to sell assets quantitive tightening since the fed uses open market operations to maintain an interest rate isnt there some tension there how do they do both at the same time,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSW1RUkp1dXNLYV9NQ1E2dzZoelVFZ3hvNnYzTjRsMHd0VDZaZnFhYnNENFc5M2RvS2dTRWZaMFZYeExNZ0lINEVvbldSWlhhSjdSdzhocUhRek1SNnc9PQ==
uskybrian good question heres some reading material on the subject<url> from the st louis fed the part youre probably looking for is the following >to provide support the fed offers the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility to a broader set of large financial institutions they can earn the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offering rate or on rrp rate by depositing funds with the fed at this facility so this second administered rate helps set a floor for the federal funds rate and >the discount rate is the interest rate charged by the fed for loans it makes through the feds discount window because banks will not likely borrow at a higher rate than they can borrow from the fed the discount rate acts as a ceiling for the federal funds rate and >in short the fed adjusts two administered rates interest on reserve balances and on rrp to keep the federal funds rate within the target range determined by the fomc and the fed adjusts the discount rate to serve as a ceiling the fed usually adjusts the three administered rates interest on reserve balances on rrp and discount by the same amount and at the same time so they move up and down together the simple answer is that the fed uses open market operations as supplementary to these other policy tools as a comprehensive set to keep the federal funds rate within the upper and lower bounds because its not the only tool being utilized to maintain the upper and lower bounds they can conduct open market operations without negatively impacting adherence to the target range the extent by which the fed can do this is limited by available slack in the market ie if reserves are tight and cash is expensive in the open market if the fed were to conduct large scale asset sales during such an environment they could hypothetically risk pushing the rate out of their target range temporarily as you elude to the more complicated answer involves discussion of yield curve control fomc communication to set expectations in the market and the types of assets being exchanged but these are probably beyond the scope of the conversation if you wanted to learn more on it however you can look into those topics e how do i do links these days i feel old e got it,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeEZmRUc1amZrdEJEOFI3WUZFdUQxd21TSWpCMHdRcDdpdlh3ZFZfSUJNcDNSdDZndGlLanFvT2QxMER4OUpNajhranpoWXV6X0cwd1BNN09nYWpFSEE9PQ==
thanks that makes sense i suppose its also true that the fed can offer financial assets for sale at any price they like and they can offer to pay interest on reserves at any interest rate they like seen in this way reserves are one of many financial assets that the fed has for sale and they need to choose their relative prices in some rational way if they want certain assets to sell it would make sense to offer them at a slightly higher interest rate lower price than reserves if there isnt much demand at current prices the assets wont sell but they dont need to hurry maybe thats another way of talking about slack in the market,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTa3RSamY1V1FrbzdrYlVmbl92QzVFQXUtQ21TM2NSMHFFY0piQjlwVGtSbzVGTnhnekl2VWZRUUxHOGJKaW1kUWs2cnRtZ2UwZ3RGZzlqTEFBMVg2LVE9PQ==

commentary in general is always going to be selfserving to some extent i do agree that the motivation from a forprofit organization is going to be editorialized to fit the business but there is still motivation for the commentary to be reasonably accurate there will also be differences between commentary from a buyside asset manager like blackrock vs sellside firms vs investment banks vs commercial banks and even among asset managers the quality of the commentary will vary greatly commentary from an asset manager like blackrock will vary from commentary from an asset manager like ark investments and different asset managers look at macro indicators through different lenses an asset manager like pimco which focuses primarily on the debt capital markets will be different than one that focuses on equity markets i have also seen some really bad commentary and research from nonprofits someone recently posted a research paper in another subreddit from an economics professor university of florida iirc paper about fund expenses and impact on retail investors but the paper was so bad and appeared to be written without consideration to how market microstructure works and excluded some very important facts it seemed like the professor didnt actually have any realworld experience and with forprofit organizations like bank holding companies commentary especially market commentary from different subsidiaries within the holding company may sometimes even disagree with each other i think the key is to understand the source potential motivation experience and access to data of any commentary,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTc3Rtd1VlYUs2QXZGbE56Z3gteHotZ3BFNk9BWUFqYWt4UGNFVTR4Tjc3dWYwYXQ3Q004ZFRkUWZYMVFCNnB2YmdOWkFlNFJZTHd5Wnl2WlhuZDhWUHc9PQ==

interesting takeaway the goals are lofty and will be hard to hit and the homebuilding industry may get a boost >bottom line the federal governments housing plan is highly ambitious and should deliver at least some boost to housing supply particularly in the purposebuilt rental space however capacity constraints in the construction sector will limit the governments ability to reach its lofty target for new homes the coming years should provide an important litmus test for how well policies geared towards purposebuilt housing can support rental construction this is because population growth is expected to be much slower due to the federal governments plan to lower nonpermanent resident levels >demandside measures in the plan are unlikely to deliver gamechanging market impacts however overall construction productivity could be enhanced through the plan this would be good news for an industry where productivity has lagged for many years,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVHktNm1OM0x4ZDdUajBKQ1V4OV9DUTB4czl6YndJSTNiVUczbmFaNUFORFk1Wm43MFo2bnQ3NWZrQUcxVUpFRkNKN09nc2w3SlRFbU9lN1lIU3IySWc9PQ==

its the difference between the y and m rate its used as a measure of market expectations about the future path of the economy if it gets flat ym difference gets very small or negative yield curve inversion then thats a sign of a likely upcoming recession the y rate is a popular indicator for peoples expectations about the path of the economy in the coming years while the m rate is a popular measure for the current economymarket conditions and yeah thats basically what the whole graph is explaining in a bit more detail,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjeWZVaVhQSFhjNmRaUTZUWDFwQzcwZGF2Q19KRnlBdEViak9EbTlWS0xDTzFFQWpVYm5lWWloX29YTUJ3MjlQMTF2ZlFGU2l6QlJEMjQwWFpveEcxaGNFQVJOTGhfVFpESDJJTEI4LURUNWs9

thank you for your post typically these types of posts are not allowed but i am going to grant an exception today as i have been planning a community update that allows a broader array of posts ugreytoc has already posted some of these mainly bank research pieces generally the expectation will be to have references to professional commentary andor economic data to support a thesis for an opinion piece this doesnt quite reach that bar as it is mainly conjecture based on a single data series and thus isnt very robust you could strengthen your argument by incorporating other supporting data series the bar for opinion pieces will be high also the use of what appears to be nonstandard terminology without explaining it isnt great ie what is a birthing zone,r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkQzh3TGcwMXFFRVpQSEZjcnp4V3EwWkpReUxFZHoyQjNRLTFLZEVIQWZNSzlncU9DQjdWclRMQlBBb1FNR0dZNVZBckxtR1BHUVBJVURWcFNJRGpnSnc9PQ==
