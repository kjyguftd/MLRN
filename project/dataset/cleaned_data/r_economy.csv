you really need to read marx to understand where he was coming from he is still relevant today because his ideas about capital wages and labor are expressed in many of the same ways that marx expressed them he was also a philosopher because one of his main issues with capitalism is that it destroyed the creative process of the masses by separating the laborer from his work his creation and reduced his creativity and ingenuity to simply represent his time spent and nothing else this reductionism was simply a way to remove the value added by the laborer and shift it to the capitalist adam smith and karl marx agreed on the labor theory of value and smith wrote about the need for vigilance in managing capitalists or they would steal all of the value provided by labor smith also wrote about the conflicts of capitalism and the possibility of capitalism cannibalizing itself which it is currently in the process of doing this dynamic is tautological to capitalism fascism is a natural course of evolution for capitalism and it is where we are today capitalism has killed more than communism ever will it has killed millions in the usa alone there has never been a communist state only socialist states run by communists and never communists that followed all of marxs ideas so we have stalinism leninism trotskyism and so forth most of these failed ideas were because you cannot implement communism from the top down it must organically take shape from the ground up no one wants to hear this but that is the way it is it is an ideal that requires human beings to reprioritize wants and needs you cannot allow this to happen in a consumer culture capitalism was supported after mercantilism because it is a vehicle to concentrate capital and wealth the bourgeoisie would not allow any other type of economic system to develop it was a natural evolution based upon expediency not merit,r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRjRmRWY3RkMxMW1QMEJRRUxzODJhR256TkdINzQ1aFUtTU1aR2tSUXJ4UWZBRTdZNEhhLWdsOFFQc3Vkc2dfR2UySnVneUpJbkFkOUw3aktyZS1CcEE9PQ==

capitalism is emergent it has no impetus nor any kind of ability to drive itself it has no agency people in positions of wealth and power benefit greatly from capitalism but they do not need capitalism to survive or even thrive if every common worker is replaced by aimlautomationmachines there will be rich people who lose wealth overall though those who maintain control over the means of production will continue to do just fine regardless of what happens to other people there is zero incentive for these people to ensure the health or safety of others other than the leverage society has over them by virtue of common people being able to derive that power from being needed once that goes away we lose all of that leverage and you end up with a vast number of extremely hungry people with no way to regain any measure of control over their lives humans will absolutely make humans obsolete weve been doing it for thousands of years this time is simply going to be far more comprehensive than ever before,r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLUtxT0hXTnJUMzhmSkNHSlF2ZktRRjlucVlFR2FFbFdXa1JaNnh2cGxmUmpMM0I3cnFla0xWR0xXSzFfYXo0Rkx2UVFOSXQyRXQ0QmptS21oc1h4U1E9PQ==

we might need money to keep flowing through an economy that does not mean that economies cant fail who the fuck would buy anything is half the point if every business and corporation were a single thoughtful entity then this line of thinking would be valid they are not businesses of all shapes and sizes are strongly incentivised to minimise head count the greatest expense and challenge for any given business is the employment of people as individual businesses they will all seek to transfer their gainful work to automation there are many advantages to automation of various kinds that greatly increase the wealth of the people at the top their implementation frequently sees large percentages of a given workforce made redundant while executives as a direct result give themselves a pay rise and see the stock price rise this will break economies and destroy many businesses a variety of incentives that drive businesses are perverse when examined from a sociological perspective but completely reasonable when considered from a given businesses perspective in a scenario where people are replaced by better systems there is no logical reason to employ a person for a job old or new the better systems are better systems,r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUWNxNmtmM0tsLXFCRzFucWg4VGRNZUNOQ0RCT01iRUNnWmJpQUFPakVkY2RyaWRwSlJ6VThhTWhwN2ZKZ051Y3UwUU9vUWJZY3B2U1dXcmk2ZTlxYlE9PQ==

not directly no but hear me out a ubi system can be satisfied through means other than a direct government payout the us health insurance system has been historically tied to your job thus the outcry over corporations laying people off willy nilly the us government doesnt fund electricity internet connections or even computer or smartphone production the states and cities may help support some of these but these are each increasingly factored into standards of living corporations collectively play a big part in improving our daily lives and they are often incentivized to further those goals creators are getting either ad revenue promotion incentives affiliate revenue subscriptions or donations most of that money is coming into the creator system through countless companies those arent tax payouts but they are fueling part of the economy we need corporations to help innovate around expanding these types of systems the paradox of a liberal democracy is that the government needs to be limited enough to all corporations to help grow the economy but strong enough to regulate them,r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRl80ZWNqQXpqY0FjbFNrcEpHNktZN1BvVU5CeU16WGV2VGl4VXdXLWEwVHZQUVdHY1RFc0d0R0QyRWxIM1BYckNtbjNGZHdRLUkyQ2pqWFFxRDl0MVE9PQ==

sometimes the venn diagram of highest paying job they can get and it does pay enough is two circles do you think everyone working multiple jobs does it for fun produces x a year in value is subjective like all value wages are how much of the value gets returned to the person producing it and when there are more people competing for a job then there are jobs available employers can offer to return less and less of that value until potential employees stop applying it doesnt change how much value the position is producing ubi addresses this by reducing the ability of employers to use economic coercion against their employees having diverse income streams creates the freedom to say no,r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabkZmTDI1cU1vWUZoWFNmYzNXdUdyX1lnM21PTUtSVTZVQlQ0ZjJZejRfbnFQNUFsVGROZFBVbHFISHY1bkJ5bHBuTTBJNUhRc2MtV2FNWDJjbWRTb011TTNNT19tazZlRkhhaVJ4dHFJYnc9
