its been a while since i did supplydemand graphs but i think this will be right for c you need to plot the functions on a graph where price is the y axis and quantity is the x axis each function is just a slope intercept y=mx+b the demand slope is an inverse of the supply slope because it goes down from left to right as opposed to up qd graph has a negative slope looking like while qs looks like so the equilibrium price is where they intersect plot the points for each function by substituting <number> for q in each equation in this case the equilibrium price is <number> because at q=<number> both equations come out to p=<number> when you impose a <number><cur> tax it shifts the supply curve to the left the new y intercept is <number> instead of <number> but the slope is the same the new equilibrium price will <number> which makes sense because of the tax of <number> the q at equilibrium will be <number> for d a function by definition has only <number> y output for each x output so a function cant be a vertical line so i think the answer is yes to both questions but honestly im not sure,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSb1dUQ3kzQlNiRmt1ellrbDAzU1phZlZCRFB6dnpQNkFOa0lsTmx0dzhGN0VoX29FWVZIN3A0YXo5bm1HNDlkVG9Gc0h1ZjJ3b0lldWRMdVBkcjhGVk5uWDBOT0xxdVM3ZDdOeXQzTDdUcTA9

because if network effects you have to use the same language as your coauthors things change very slowly in <number> years things are only going to look slightly different compared to now for example julia has been an up and comer for many years for micro if you know stata r python and youll be fine better than fine for macro its more heterogenous though i will say fortran is relatively rarer knowing how to code generally is the most important then you pick the lang you need for a task probably just whatever your coauthors are using the other point is that you probably wont build a lot of toolslibraries unless youre building macro or io models but even then code tends to be project specific my advice is to worry way way more about research topics methods reading papers etc if you are a good coder you can adapt easily,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSOHVDbmd2bWp1MEw5OTV3WEtBOXBBSzJMZW96eHFnamFWdWtHclljcTJEVE9zdm03T1JuU21YcTR3ZmFJTVIzbU9XWDd4eG56czZmSm44M2tSUlNvbGJ5MUZTa21GeFpQaGkzRVpSYlVZQm89

imo you need to be familiar with matlab and r or stata most macro papers are done in matlab and even though julia can do more than matlab it is used more rarely and the fact that their syntax is very similar is helpful for transitioning from one to the other python is rarely used in my experience but can be used for almost anything i think that r is gaining relative to stata but especially in the age of chat gpt translating from one to the other is pretty easy,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSNmtjT2lfUlR0cjlMSWZTcEphV0JHUFoyLTlIUVh1QW1vd0NYT2ZQLTdmNFRiMEhaclBYRUNoaTY2SDczaVpDRldkLVVPczFXUHBERGFvVERLWFUtQWNnaVg1Q0YzcjNIVlBRdUdGUlZ0Q0E9
thats not too optimistic at all and in fact ideal though i wouldnt worry about making them full blown installable python packages a lot of the more sophisticated or younger researchers will have a git repo for each project or set of related projects gentzkow and shapiro have a handbook of sorts you can probably find through google that talks about good coding practices my point about how you dont need to worry about building up tools and libraries is that if you do project a in python and project b is not going to use any of the code from project a then you can write project b in whatever language you want and it doesnt matter or if theres a little bit of overlap you can port the code so if you choose a language today youre not going to be locked in forever there will be little if any switching costs very rarely and never this early in your career should you be spending any time or effort trying to turn your research code into some big code base like a startup <number> of the time once you finish a project youll never look at that code again the remaining <number> is just borrowing data cleaning when youre going to use the same data source,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSYVlJTURTLVZNbFRTTXRkX09pZllIZ0FhdHlaUUpaYVFRYW85SkJiTHZkS290aU94NW1YRVo0VTd3ZllpTHVJLTFYeWFTZTJPTkxNYWY1WkVhd3FhTGplNWp5aTNhSkJNMlBUeUZXSWpzc0E9

moving from point b to f makes no sense budget going from deficit to surplus is a decrease in the demand for loanable funds less borrowing the demand curve shifts left from d to d assuming that tax credits actually change behavior the tax credit increases the supply of loanable funds the supply curve shifts right the only movement consistent with that is from point c to a or the tax credit does nothing like most tax credits and you just move from point c to b but the budget going from deficit to surplus inarguably decreases demand for loanable funds so you must start at a point on d either c or f looks like the person who came up with the multiple choice answers didnt actually know the answer,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbjhxX0VVQ2JoQWdoVms0WmdWNzRDekkybWxQY1lEeEZwRlptLVdTVVdjNFljRzkzT1QxbUl2dnR2SnhOWDNOYTNBQkF5VGZVVjAwM2xYQ3lZa0dUeEE9PQ==

at pc how much would producers want to sell thats the supply side at pc how much would consumers want to buy thats the demand side your answer to both questions should be qs on the xaxis now is demand greater than supply shortage or is supply greater than demand surplus or excess supply to avoid confusion with other concepts,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMFIyTFhrenJVSlcwdkMtanI2bzQwRDNTTG5lNTVIeDZwbXU1dWRQNmtnbUdreWR4NWhMcmp0Vi1uWThQVXdTTjFVZUViZzNldExIbUxTOVhEU2FzUVE9PQ==
i appreciate your explanation it seems to be that there would be a surplus but everything ive read online points towards there being a shortage in this relationship,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadkhVRGQ2SmhFQk5ObTc5dTVpTzI0ZURvZjM4M2h3Y0lSd2ZwWEYwaHB0UkJnQzhuc0lHTkpmOG5GVTc4aUowb2piczdOeGxlaS1Jc2NDWjJKQ0F2OEE9PQ==
there is a shortage at a low price buyers want q but at that price sellers are only willing to produce q,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZTdEYnpCZ3FqV0FNNlBfaXlXNFBsMHFFTVc4Y1J6T1JtVWtWTVF3cl9oN19YT0tQS0NoZUZId0t0Ri1PVjRScnA5V3BwcjZFX2NwcE1EWkhBcFUxOUE9PQ==
right there is a shortage why do you think there would be a surplus,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNablpjeEIzN29nTFo1cFROUlhiZ0JMRWlLVnpKMUIwTzVKRjBLbzB1NkVtUzRWdGF3Tm5lekd3TFlzV1VLZzJsdjd5ZlRKNjR2Y2pUUS1GZ01JRTRZd2c9PQ==
mainly due to the supply and demand meeting above the pc that was introduced seeing that gives me the impression that the demand would be met allowing for a surplus to build but maybe im over thinking it now in terms of the shortage since the supply and demand meet at q would the shortage be equal to the difference between q and q rather than qq since they should be able to meet the demand in q,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV3ZoZEhoSTVvSVRwNHFHUzhuUTFQVElKT1JmUmU2RFhMWjNCeHlBTmVjdXJSbUlkcDFGaDRnbWp3dHpqbTlRQVZPOTB3bndJazRhOEJ1U0lLVTRpQWc9PQ==
in the graphpe is the equilibrium price where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded the government then imposes a price ceiling at pc which is below the equilibrium price pe due to the price ceiling pc the quantity demanded q exceeds the quantity supplied q leading to a shortage the shortage is equal to the difference between the quantity demanded q and the quantity supplied q because of this mismatch in supply and demand the new equilibrium point is at pc resulting in a shortage equal to the difference between q and q,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNnNaa3ZOWFFrTlN0YU5XWWZUWmx3ZEQ3NGdac0xmQjEzd1NtbmtoaG9KVU04UzluYTJ3UDUyRVAzemRlSkJsbzVMaklVUjBYM1BfeFFQRktMTkxWS3FFRGhwdkJTU2NEdl9iSEN1Zk9aQWM9
for these types of questions you should imagine the graph without the price ceiling line first then add the price ceiling and see how things change supply and demand meeting at the middle q is the most efficient outcome without the price ceiling then adding the price ceiling changes the quantity demanded and supplied with the govt enacting a price ceiling an artificial lower price suppliers only want to produce at q because its not as profitable but demand is high at q because its cheaper no supply but high demand = shortage,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUVdFazVfa2lOeXBYclZRUWFGTTNGSTQtTEFla1lZSHRPZDNnVk50N05PWTJIZURiTnVSM0lHN3RCVHk4N2hWSkRDNlJHRkxJSHVibWtUNGxvNWhvUHc9PQ==
i think what youre saying gives price ceiling its name the market clearing price would naturally occur at above the price ceiling but in all kinds of micro problems it helps to put yourself in the shoes of the agents in the problem the other comment is obviously right but maybe this can help you think about the problem in a more systematic way if youre a consumer and youre willing to pay <cur><number> for a bag of chips but the government holds the price to <cur><number> at maximum youd probably buy more chips right so you previously wanted to buy q bags of chips but now you want to buy how many chips likewise say youre a producer if you saw a price of <cur><number> we know you are willing to make chips but imagine that it costs me <cur><number> to make my chips if the government says i can only sell for <cur><number> i would stop making chips right there might be some producers that make chips really cheaply so theyll still make chips so if some producers stop chip production the quantity of chips produced should go from the market clearing q to how many chips from someone who has finished a fair amount of micro theory class work a lot of micro can be done by just putting yourself in the shoes of someone in the problem and thinking about what they would do hope this helps,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacHNINmtUTkhRTi1DbWo5dTVIbFdfTlN0Ry1CdlVOM1pBQmRoMW5FOERJTDllN2xna0gxdjJ1TXkxMWpDRVAwTlVPTG4wYks4R1h2OUFPNHJ4TG1WN3c9PQ==
