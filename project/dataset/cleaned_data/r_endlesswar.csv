remember goldman sachs being described as a vampire squid whos tentacles reach all across the globe a conspiracy is just when a group of people conspire for a shared idea or cause think of zionism as cosa nostra its just a pledge and an identification symbol part of the recruiting and selection process but not the actual goal ultimate goal of zionism is not israel as a country but a globalist one world government as they say with magicians tricks pay no attention to what the other hand is doing israel to them only matters because that is where they want to place the ruling center of their one world government hence the ethnic cleansing of the natives and turning the whole land into a super fortress they expect rebellions and people fighting back when they try to implement their one world government all oligarchies are minority rule and they love centralization more than anything because it concentrates more power in their hands the ultimate goal of oligarchy as mechanical and economic mechanismsystem would be to concentrate all control over the whole world any movement with such grandiose ambitions needs an ideology for its foot soldiers just like in the italian mafia the mob bosses broke their vows all the time but would find justification if other mob bosses talked about it with them and blessed it same as with catholic crusades where the crusaders were the worst sinners of europe and all they did was rape and pillage but the ideology protected them the worst rapist and drug addicts joined islams earliest jihads and they were protected by ideology because they served the cause right the demorats in us who were completely inbred prior to the civil war but claimed to be representatives of racial superiority and everyone was banned from criticizing them and pointing out nasty birth defects pointing out any of those things during those periods would get you killed in those days because the ruling party ideology that functioned same as any group that claimed a monopoly on violence while demanding that you disarm yourself and submit to any and all rules they arbitrarily write or declare for you in us zionists sponsor politicians who demand gun confiscation red flag laws and arrests for speech while in their zionist colony they offer their converts freedom of all the restrictions they imposed in countries under their covert control heck of a recruiting mechanism right,r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTjc4eVZxZGM5Y0lkRVF5aDBXOFJqc3BmSjhlQWxrajRtdDZEMm9ONFlONkpBVmRlNFkyTXkxZDA1T0h5VjdxNlplNkV3TXBrWGE4aThveU9RcVBpamc9PQ==

<number> im not worshipping anyone especially political candidates from countries on the other side of the planet i simply pointed out that navalny was murdered in jail by the order of putin and now putin directly initiated an arrest warrant for navalnys wife so he can do the same to her <number> what regions are the majority of russian soldiers being drafted from most russians being drafted into the front lines are from russias poorer regions anyone with a brain knows many of the poorer southern regions of russia are predominantly muslim chechnya for example putin is drafting muslims from poor regions of russia to die on the frontlines while christian slavs from moscow and st petersburg are being drafted at a comically low rate why is this this is because if people in moscow notice s of thousands soldiers dying then they will protest which they tried to at the beginning of the war before putin made it illegal to protest people who live in the poor regions of russia have less access to internet and are way less likely to make a fuss about it the point is im not defending navalnys political views but if your argument is he hates muslims then my argument is putin is systematically drafting muslims in russia at an disproportionate rate when compared to christian russians therefore putin believes a muslim russians life is worth less than christian russians also what about all the muslim ukrainians that have died due to putins invasion do they not matter i can gather a list of many cases of muslims who died because of putins actions can you generate me a list of muslims who were killed due to any actions taken by navalny last point say what you will about my mom but i will say that i think your mom is a good woman,r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTVA1WG50ejU0ekxfUEN5Y0FJYW1lWDRzMVhGMmRVdktBR3k1ejFjWVRhUnpkQ1d4ZW1yZGZ6bkk3WnIzTERZazlyQ3I4dUFtRXJTcklObVkyZnZCcHc9PQ==

its not even imperialism physically anymore new colonialism is financial debt slavery look at how enslaved people in the west are individually then look at every country that the west ever helped who owns their resources and their infrastructure for example they crashed greeces economy to force the government to auction off all the small islands that western elites coveted but could not purchase before or look at finland and the last <number> years of it being helped by eu and nato nokia bought out and destroyed forced to take in foreigners who refuse to assimilate and wont work because a man with four wives and <number> kids will be on welfare for eternity they have crashed the nordic welfare states and now the native born who used to own vacation homes have to sell them off guess who is going to live in those scenic properties now the same people who got those idyllic greek islands privatized people dont realize the main reason sanctions failed against russia it has minimal debt it is a net exporter and advanced enough to self sustain every sector of its economy not to mention its technology sector is developed enough that it can copy any western tech but up until now was held back by international intellectual property laws several developed nations for example can reverse engineer an iphone or even intelamd computer chips but the ip laws hold them back every piece of software the west ever produced has been hacked and modified but remains in vaults should the conflict escalate we would see ip protections no longer recognized and then a dozen countries could be producing not just iphones but modifying them into better versions against the wishes of apple corporation what would happen if apple suppliers were no longer indebted or fear bankruptcy because apple forced them to take on too much debt to expand their operations to served apple better this applies to almost every industry only those willing to take on debt were allowed by governments to rise up in their sectors as the dominant companies and all that debt services banks who get unlimited currency printed out by central banks you can be a genius capitalist invent the best technology and a central bank can give <number> billion to musk and <number> billion to gates and <number> billion to jobs and voila now they leader those economic sectors and all the capital you pooled to start your business is gone khadaffi was killed because he made libya debt free and announced he will help solve the debt of all of africa yanukovich was overthrown and his son murdered because he was going to accept a loan from russia at <number> interest that would have paid off majority of ukraines debt to imf and world bank by <number>,r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQXZkWTRZSWpwRy1CMDBwQTNaRUtjcjVzaE5yOWdUOVNBR3ZzNG1WcS1SOXpEcV9vVkJSRlZiSXpYa2h2bkYteDFPQ21jLTd1ZFppUWJXQmNLMUhqcEE9PQ==

picking and choosing your facts will not get you to the right conclusion lets start with <number> because up to that point gaza was on trolled by egypt and the west bank by jordan there was no expectation of a separate palestinian state though to be entirely accurate jordan was part of the original jewish mandatee but was given to the arabs and to this day is overwhelmingly palestinian ie it is the actual palestinian state after the <number> day war in <number> israel offered to give up the captured territories in exchange for peace the arabs refused and ultimately they did a surprise attack in israel in <number> the yom kippur war israel ultimately won that war then sadat the president of egypt agreed to make peace with israel for the return of the sinai peninsula the israelis agreed because they always wanted peace and not territory sadat wanted no part of gaza so it remained under israeli control ultimately israel decided toturn over full control of gaza to the palestinian authority and removed all settlors there was no embargo an gaza and the hope was that they would build a better place for their population instead hamas murdered their fellow palestinians and de opted all of the resources to building a military state and attacking israel while it is true that israel tried to embargo goods that could be used for military purposes we know now that hamas freely brought in goods and weapons in tunnels along its border with egypt the fact that it used its money to bring in arms instead of civilian goods was completely on hamas interest to note that egypt has a border with gaza so israel never had full control over what went in and out of gaza on the other hand egypt was forced to periodically crack down on gaza because they were creating trouble in sinai that covers gaza through october <number> except that leading up to october th israel was allowing qatar to send large sms f money to gaza and allowing oalestineans to work i israel in the hope that hamas would be more responsible if there was help in building the economy anyway so what about the west bank israel agreed to the oslo peace process with the palestinian authority under oslo the west bank was divided into <number> jurisdictions one area was and remains under complete palestinian control so the palestinian authority has for many years fully governed the palestinian people in that part of the west bank another part of the west bank was to be determined in subsequent negotiations this is where almost all of the settlements are it was understood in oslo that israel was to end up with at least a part of this area because israel had legitimate self defense needs without this area israel was only <number> miles wide and would be very vulnerable by the way there is no reason that un ultimate palestinian state could not have some jews unless you believe in ethnic cleansing i note in this regard that israel has <number> million arab citizens with full legal rights anyway israel made an offer to give most of the territory the palestinians they never responded or negotiated but instead started the first and later the second infatada there were two other formal offers by israel one with <number> of the west bank the palestinians did not respond or agree to negotiate why you might ask because it was never about land it was about killing jews which brings us up to october th one of the most barbaric attacks ever raping women and burning babies there is no moral basis for this period and as outlined above the palestinians have on numerous occasions chosen ethnic cleansing of jews over peace so you are right that it didnt start on october th the intransigence of the palestinians predated that for quite a while with no serious partner for peace israels only course is self defense look at the history not the propaganda,r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSWFYazRDZEMyeUcxaDJOeWZxdElHNjI2d05PdHZqZ192LXRtOXVpUTYyOUp4X3d2bEIwazhRMVk1Y20xT2xUV2o5TldMV3VMLWNia0dUdFN1QjF0dUE9PQ==
assuming what you say is true then there appears to be contradictions and cherrypicking scriptures where god seems to be bloodthirsty is obviously a problem and i think it could be argued that the alleged command to kill canannites does not extend to palestinians i do not disagree that jewish claim to the land is any more legitimate than that of others but both muslims and jews are fighting over the land while this scripture is an obvious command from god to love each other and coexist,r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQWJBMG9lV21rZWVUY213VFVsNUg2cGRDX3dhb1VRazhaUjRIdVJucmc3dzlkQTE1LUN6dHFBeFViSDd4VkRmMmF5T2dWWEd3RjA4N1hpcHEzSk82OHhoQmlja1ZTN1FMWmIwd2k0ZDltcDA9
