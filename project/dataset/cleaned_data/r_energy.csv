edit clarified the specific electronics needed they would need either a dcdc regulator or an inverter + rectifier the latter dont themselves necessarily need transformers the reason is that the battery voltage will change as it charges so will pv module voltage as the sun moves but maybe the battery containers have their own and can connect directly to pv farm though that one itself has some extra comparable in cost electronics to optimize module performance balance the load and provide some resilience in any case induction or arc melting both require further electronics to convert voltage as for setup power ratings hint at the following during the day <number>h half the pv power will flow to batteries while at nighth + solar shoulders batteries will provide the power to plant batteries may be able to regulate the voltage for pv if their electronics are oversized by x which would allow for a linear configuration else it would have to be a star configuration with a central exchange voltage spec for all <number> parts,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYblZWVEhILWJUdU9BYk9lZ2lzUGlySTRPTEcwaTRyX1JGb09sV0hhN0M2X2hyT0F0cXBYbjZPUFV4cWYzZFJPZ1RBejZMYnphZzI3dE9PcGl5dk5XWkpEbkdkYWhKUU1kRE1GeGJJSE9fd3M9

my question to you is where is the extra heat coming from solar panels dont generate heat they absorb and release heat from the sunlight the same amount of sunlight that would reach the ground if the solar panels werent there therefore the only change in heat is the time of day it is absorbed and released back into the air or reflected into the sky i dont see how that the same sunlight affects the global warming equation here,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVUl1bHN0NWpwaG0yMnNvV1VSeERxLWlrbUp3T2dEZWx3dzVNQ0ZNcFZhY3YzbGZRbGZfeDFzUEdpV1RYeFV6WlFtbS1sSC1RS3JYWXIzX2JaWC1YZ1VQNUMzZXBxVUhFYWpQUFJNN0pCZ1E9

yes it is dynamic a lot depends on when loads occur and if any can be shifted i used to charge my evs overnight but now do it off excess solar during the day i work from home so i have that flexibility i am not sure i understand why capital cost of storage will dominate investors in storage will be looking for return based on lowest cost per kwh and higher price per kwh sold as capital cost comes down cost per kwh should also fall assuming demand is there unlike intermittent solar storage can sell into any time period and is quickly dispatchable unlike nuclear and other resources that may need time to ramp,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaDB6dkhMOHF1S1RZT0tmT24xUktpSFBWRGRmUmR0RG9HUk0tN2JEX05Bd1FKWGU4NHZYTG93YzNmRlBQUkludFZ3ei1nQ0dFbkFyR3NIQ3BPV2d6QWc9PQ==

no the heat generation does not have anything to do with the home consumption of energy its a biproduct that is released from the glass panel yes home solar panels do the same exact thing if the goal is to cut global warming then solar panels are not the solution they actually produce more heat then if you look at what it takes to produce a solar panel its not effective when it is looked at as whole not saying that solar is bad but its not helping to reduce any climate change and its adding to it,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaODJqNWZQeXpLNXlfLUlPcF9lNWZTM1ZIUDZxR1prYjZJMmV5QzJGX2JVOXdKZTN6YU5Eb0tiNVp2S1RYMHBFaHBDLVFZcnRGYlNxV0JpRnNzcVdlY0E9PQ==

so as you know passing sunlight through glass it produces heat thats why they came out with lowe and double and triple pane windows for homes and businesses the glass in a solar panel heats in sunlight and it builds up in the panel because they are made up of a material that naturally heats up then its released at a higher temperature than if it were to just be absorbed into the soil the panels actually hold the heat and the ground absorbs the heat the solar panels release the heat while the ground cools itself is probably a better explanation plants also absorb sunlight and use it to produce o and solar sights are farm land that is being built into solar fields the ground is not releasing heat back into the atmosphere in comparison to solar panels,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTRTUkFoODhTamRjQXJDNk1RZWlBNXR4MzdQbEQ1VlM2OUlzY2FDakNxNnJqYzJ4dUhSeVM3YWtnRFdwRFVuUjdEaVNHMXdjb1dTWnU3NldoSzhlTVE9PQ==

number of units is like comparing solar panels to wind turbines you cant compare them by count offshore wind is <number>x bigger than land based but also more expensive you have to compare them by cost per mw where offshore is cheaper and provides more power but not by a huge difference to onshore land siting is an issue and in the uk its mostly scotland that has a lot of good potential you want high altitude and good consistent wind speed offshore wind is good but onshore has advantages too you get a better performance and a more stable grid for having a short transmission line basically you will want to put wind turbines in all the very good spots on land to get your best return and you have theoretically unlimited demand because when you end up with a <number> renewable grid then you can start to generate clean chemical fuel in the summer to burn in the winter when you dont have much solar in the northern lats,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3Q0T1V5RUlDd1luZG1lYzUyQThfeHQ0dGlTeWJnRy1iRTRLWW5OZlQ1c2xXakQxT1F5dmZzX3lzMlNjOGYwa0NrUUVtOG9CaWVGX25yOW1UT0lwU0E9PQ==

for evs its going to be a bit difficult as others have mentioned you need to look at the difference between cell module and pack prices and stick to one to have a good comparison always triple check your sources which of these prices they are talking about however there are several trends in buidling cars where these difference get iffy currently many automakers are going for a celltopack approach skipping the module level the next step that is being worked on by everyone at the moment is celltochassis sometimes called celltobody where you dont even have packs anymore but the cells are integrated directly into the body of the car this is another step for cost savings so the safest way to compare prices going forward is on cell level and then separate out what kinds of costs are added if you want to do modules packs or celltobody directly,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaFREQ0h1am5qclRXR21nNFpqSENDS3pWX2V0cFBSa2d2c2J3RzFSQlBmYm4tcVhZVGtsMXl0eHdNeHNkaUVfd1g5U05XT0t5Y3VuaGFoSWdJMTNrbGc9PQ==
its a massive difference you need almost four land based turbines to match one offshore the reality is <number><number> of energy is generated offshore by <number><number> of the turbines and that was in <number> <number> years ago there have been massive expansions since then in both farm number size and turbine size several offshore sites cover sq miles each with <number>+ turbines good luck building anything close to that onshore youd need to build <number> onshore turbines to come close and they sure as anything arnt going to be in the same place and thats per site theres multiples of these beign built of in planning thats before we even start getting into actual operational hours and quality of wind and the availability of spaces to build them onshore land connections are low impact and hardly recognisable once built im surprised the poster before even mentioned them you can also place your production and maitinance facilities in one nearby port that can access all the farms and export components large equipment like the substations is built in one go here and then transported to site by submersible ship where ever its needed onshore wind has a part to play but its a very small part,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWkVkejN4QmxtMk9MT0liSXJ4enZzVjR1dlJBaXZyU2VyUFRnd0RkeHotVzBYZkRVNG1BQll3Yld0M2FfYy0yelpodGNPZUFUX0poT0JkdHQ4cjVvWGc9PQ==

its not an eitheror wind produces at night solar doesnt wind produces more in winter than solar solar produces more when theres a high power demand in the industry during the day and also when we will have high demand for air conditioning in the future due to progressing climate change with an adequate mix you can minimize the amount of storage needed as wind and solar complement each other in some respects depending on cost it may also be advisable to install a bit of overproduction capacity to shorten the intervals where storage is needed and accept some loss of potential production the cost on wind solar and especially batteries is continuing to declineso where the optimum mix for these will end up is still very much anyones guess,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTDdSTk1PblVEMlNEZml4S09wUk9xSHRBa2gySnZBMzNnWlg3YU9YRFZyS3c5LVlQWkpzMjNXcndJOWVCUnM1VExKZmRMTzktX3Z1Z3JPeGFoUmRGamc9PQ==

ecosystem services are vital to wildlife health and when managed right can keep our natural habitats in good health which has tangible effects on our climate the landscape is essentially a naturally evolved solar farm designed to trap carbon in the soil as stored fertility at the moment commercial interest has developed global agricultural systems to be far away from the consumer and over reliant on artificial inputs that aim to oppress and manage wild ecosystems there are real efficiencies to be gained from lowering artificial inputs and managing the landscape with bio diversity and soil health principles something that cant be done after you have set your concrete footings and pads for the infrastructure needed in wales it is proposed that farms aim for <number> tree cover in order to receive extra payment currently the average for wales is <number> to <number> depending on region this is an achievable aim however the financial pressures on farmers mean they cant afford to plant these trees to plant a tree and keep protected while its young from cattle and sheep can cost up to <cur><number> each farmers are insecure about where that money is coming from and if they dont find it will lose income and likely have to close business the government needs to communicate better with the farmers who know the landscapes they work in and help them transition away from artificial inputs and monoculture cash crops putting solar panels on buildings is appropriate because it puts them directly where the power is needed,r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTVEzblFPdjFoZGpmNmhiUUk4c0RiQXVjNGxPQXdOSVdjR3ZUaERvQzZ5akkzZWc3SGFFTnIzeENGRkJ5cWdOZGhjU0Y5bVV6QmFyZ0t4LXpsSFQweXc9PQ==
