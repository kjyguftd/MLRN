you have a few options but selecting the best option depends on many factors such as design life load profile seasonal variation electricity tariffs etc i do consulting in this space feasibility studies design procurement etc usually li ion flow or sodium sulfur batteries have a similar levelised cost of electricity lcoe with <number><number> year life but flow and nas are even better for <number>+ years usually a hybrid solution grid connection plus renewable system provides the lowest lcoe if you are expect to install ev chargers then that changes the game again ev chargers are relatively high loads this means you might max out your grid connection limit and you need a battery that can handle the higher power requirements,r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTb04yWER5a3BJeFFKM1hfVnZNWExsT3FqMXJkdmN3S3JPc2JLT3Jja1pCcEpYWTA0WW9hSnFTLTZoNndYQ1Q0NXFRR3pEUnFiaWJPbkZELUVIa3MyTVE9PQ==

the article gives no details about the batteries other than new ironair type what capacity and how long will they be able to supply the normal grid load enough to last thru a long winter night thru several overcast days seems a better fit for a less seasonal location like hawaii the amount of solar panels needed for a mn winter day might prove excessive in summer,r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVlg4aGRvTjBocWVEMXFzQkJpMWtzNTFUNkxwSk1tRzlGOWNGT1RQTERwb2FsZmRYVUNydk52QVJYQzJMZE81Q0FXVVdpNy11eFdha3JkR1RGcS15REE9PQ==

the official website doesnt go into that although im sure it could be found in filings with the state regulatory folks if youre curious forms pitch is that its iron batteries can do major output for three or four days <number> hours is the eyecatching claim at less cost thats the pitch anyway sherco solar project xcelenergycom<url>,r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUlFtYU5pcjA2YmZxUW9hQmVidG9qQnVqYVdsOXhQd1VqcTkyU0hmNEgxQmdNaDRvQ0kwUW53M3g4enBtb2JDUE9Ybi1tb2xjUEliZ1Zub1h0R3lMZmc9PQ==

storage analyst here imo these costs are likely to remain high on the customer side whats needed is more robust incentives from stateutility that allow residents to take advantage of home backup while being paid to participate in tou arbitrage demand response and vpp programs many states are still learning to design these programs but places like ma and ny can generally save you some cash over the life of the system,r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYVc1dmZJX05uNzBPVlNOdC1IenRUWDd2emN0bGZMREl5RFhDY3hmcmhEQjg3YkdFTXpsZjlxRk5oRHVQMkYtRmZ5QlA3RGtwWHR4Ul81dHpKQ1g0X0E9PQ==

they all will make it because theyre not competing with one another mechanical storage like hydro will remain cost effective where its basically for free ie where the geography is already right for it and water is available electrochemical methods ie batteries are best for power storage which doesnt require long term storage at least not to the extent most people imagine because they minimize the knock on costs on power production and transmission infrastructure heat storage and potentially even cold storage is the only thing where seasonal storage actually makes senseand that must be super cheap because the storage doesnt get cycled often basically once or twice a year also theres always some biowastebiogas which will be available for storage and can be used for power or heat as needed hydrogen flywheels energy vaults syngassynfuel and the like on the other hand are already dead as can be for energy storage,r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZjE5RWl1ZEZXWC1LNl9JUUZ5OHlJMFJUZTROVFJMTkJtMHBtUXM0aXRTQmk1NzB4TjNmQlBNaEJlWktXQy1zMjBpNXhxTTdCR2hEZGgzMTA2N00tVEE9PQ==
