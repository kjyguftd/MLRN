screws into a blind hole so lock nuts wont work but im liking the idea of the completely hidden lock washer will it bight into something other than just mild steel im pretty sure the fixture is harder than mild,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOVdPYkxzZzlNSlo2eFBGdjZZLXZieEE4eV92NTNBSEt2LWFOX3FqOXYxZHNfMjVqcVhVV09ZcUMwLWdaNVdUMmgzdkRnWEdydExMY1BiR2FDQzBvNWc9PQ==

the book answer claims that a correctly designed joint shouldnt require exotic vibration resistant magic solutions obviously the book and reality rely on a different set of underlying assumptions question <number> are the screws strong enough for the joint under the applied loads if they are strong enough are they being installed with the correct torque for the joint design if the screws need to be larger or they are being installed loose youre going to have a bad time question <number> if thread locker adhesives are failing are the threads properly cleaned first properly applied locktite works very well in a broad range of applications every time ive had adhesive performance issues it comes back to surface preparation question <number> what are the materials involved what are the joint materials the screws the coolant since water based coolants are most common i really dont expect thats causing the locktite to fail,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVDhkaExPaXVjaDdseExENjNmbFg4UTY1blNhR21XTE9SQU1Td1Axd29QZng3RUJ0V1JQSFpIdjAydmRZZ0RZam1fYkQ4REZ6RWpiN1VUTVp6UGdUWVE9PQ==

im surprised your general sentiment isnt upvoted higher i design stuff thats meant to vibrate any time a bolt comes loose its because theres not enough preload to prevent movement between the joined parts the ideal solution is bigger screws andor stronger bolts with the assumption on the latter that the mating threads can withstand the extra tension without failure,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOGU5VUp3YnZlUkdsUm5LTE5HUjd6dWowQ0IyekxWTTZEZ0V3S1hRZ2tiM2UxQ1luX3F1Q1NkbHJPY3lYQmp5NWYycjhueEQ4ai13VHUwME1vRHJHZnc9PQ==

id guess you have a contaminant like oil or water or something that prevents the loctite from bonding also iirc the permatex version takes and hour or two to reach <number> strength according to its datasheet i dont know the composition of thread locking compounds but if it is superglue high shear strength mixed with some other thingsthen superglue crystalizes cureshardens with water or your coolant usually from the humidity in the air also dont use red loctite unless you can get a serious torch on it you have to get the metal to <number> degf for it to soften please use blue or another nonpermanent thread locking compound blue is usually better anyway because it gums the threads up and doesnt necessarily require as much of a surface bond red is kind of it either bonds and holds or it doesnt bond and fails,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaHpWQW1TZGl2SWhLcjJYajMzbExVYVpGTldVZU9XS256TmRUZzRCMUlwal9ja25hV0Q0MXNWQ2c4NktIcGtKYmVQOHFudF9MT2FucTlxMG5peWc3Nnc9PQ==

administer the professional registration process on behalf of the engineering council you mention engineer is not a protected title but the four professional titles chartered engineer incorporated engineer engineering technician and ict technician are provide input into parliamentary consultations play a role in or directly publish industry standards eg the iet maintains the iet wiring regulations which are part of the building regulations publish a ton of technical journals and other technical and academic literature and host technical conferences run various industry awards programmes generally help recognise achievement and provide networking opportunities for engineers at all stages of their career raise the profile of engineering with public outreach eg stem education programmes most if not all provide a professional advice service eg for independent ethical advice many provide a benevolent fund for members falling into hardship they do quite a bit whether maintaining london premises most of which are open for use by members for meetings is value for money is questionable i agree but ultimately all the institutes are member run so if you dont like it its possible to join the relevant committee and change it,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU2Q2TW85SklUTnBpLVpjb2V2NkRTck5VMUhyUm14TUhzYmxSeV9McnhJUzJFMDRsS0R4dDAtd0RvTkV6eHRUa19tQS04NFYtRG1JN3N3cUo0TWNoQ1V6aUxKeGt4SnRxcTN4Ul9KS2hPYTA9

thanks for the thorough reply they do those things but why do they cost so much money it seems crazy that it costs so much for a membership when you consider that almost all of their activities are done by volunteers stem outreach is pushed by the government only because they want cheaper engineers there really is no shortage it seems like they should cost perhaps <cur><number> a year to be part of not <cur><number>+,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQ0FjT3RqLUtrM2JtLTktUElOWURlN2R5Q1R0YWhWZTdYQWVpbU54RGViUE96RkJsRi1XXzc5V0VwMmJJRmkzbWpIMUhtczRjR0JTTUpBRXgzSi1hc2c9PQ==

was originally a very important part of engineering career now more of a political lobby group with little member consent they seem to have lost their edge by offering protected titles to less qualified members those protected titles have very little portability outside of uk which is a real shame for those starting out its a great networking tool and way of getting professional development but considering cost of membership its debatable that there is value in this format,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbTVLanZVSkdpN2tvejJFNkVQZkF0M0N3YmhrdGduOVg5ZV9LaXM1Zzc5dXN6ZVZJMHlLZW45dDVGREJZZ0pYQ3VSZm5SeGVXNF9NdlpFQ1hKTUJGY2c9PQ==

you can actually look up what the peis spend their money on in their annual reports people often point at the iets savoy place as an example of bad spending but the iet has owned the building for a long time so its cost to members is actually relatively little taking the iet as an example they spent <number>k on knowledge services and solutions this is the biggest expense and includes all their conferences publications regulatory committees etc <number>k on membership and professional development administering the professional registration process development programmes etc <number>k on education policy and awareness stem education outreach policy consultation etc the membership fees balance almost exactly with the membership and professional development spend the rest of the expenditure is covered by income from other sources charitable grants investments and income from knowledge services eg journal subscriptions conference tickets sponsorships,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb0Ixa1l0WmtaQjhMN1VXajVYTmpqeElad2VNMlplc3ZpeVdCWUZucWR6UVN3RklPSnlES2c4a1FCLVc5MEYwMWY5bGdHcFR6UmIwcS1UWW1FMS1IQ01RUFJadkhWY25MV2x4alV2OVBTck09

i often think of it as an engineering tax they do have input into some parliamentary committees etc and they do host things in london but the access the provide to any groups outside of london is pretty poor in the north east its really the volunteer local committees that do all the heavy lifting my biggest gripe however is the iet online library is so poor so much is behind paywalls etc the ieee in america is so much better at providing their members access to technical papersstandardsproceedings i would love that level of access for those of us outside of london less iet dinners and extremely lightweight magazine content also members are now limited on access to savoy place per week,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRkxmenlPcE1tU3lRZGF6UXN5aG1UVEh2bGVySnVEWFFtQ1d6NUxxdnVXMFdaZjBPYkhHdi1pQmZsRnhqZjVwUWR4a0g5MVhTMnZxWDZuQ2hVRHJUSmc9PQ==

ieng and ceng still have decent portability provided you have a fully accredited undergraduate degree under the washington or sydney accord i agree that ceng and ieng get handed out to everyone and their dog these days and so the value is much eroded and if you hold ceng without a washington accord degree its practically useless if trying to port to peng or similar,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOUE0UFVQcFM2blJKa3VWWmVoV1ZvZExGWmhNTnZjVzU3MlhPVGt5aE52em52VXZnMjZBdDRRVGpxWVpPRTE4dXduNlZTemU0OEV2NlJ1Y1k4ZmY3Qkw5b1lpRVhYT3dEdWFiekVsUnJpVnM9

about <cur>m of that goes directly to the uk engineering council in registration fees roughly <cur>m is the direct cost of administering the scheme headcount to support the pre pri checks and run the pri process train and administer the volunteer pri and pra networks expense reimbursement to volunteers verification costs payment processing costs etc its not just ceng either its all membership programmes fellowship corporate memberships accreditation of degrees graduate and apprentice programmes etc the remaining <cur>m is overhead finance it offices and buildings hr and legalgovernance cost thats not out of line with other peis or with charitable entities in general whether that <cur>m is money well spent is a valid question but its not an unusual amount of expenditure for a charity with a complex global entity structure a physical presence on multiple continents and the need to maintain a fairly sizeable it system and website to support its activities,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZS2FkVmNwaWVBN1d3M2dkUEp6TEhMWExqaGRmMW9jcVRJQkt2eTZmYnNmNkV2UHFoSmRXRzc3dTE4MXJfeHdhV29ycE1tdkdmMUw0cWo3WDZnU0tCa2xXT1hacFpkYzcyUnE0eWFRSFNWWEE9

im in the us but i have heard of chartered engineers in the uk is that a big thing do you have to be a chartered engineer to have a serious job in the us we have professional engineers but that is pretty much only recognized for electric power and civil engineering and totally not a thing outside of those fields,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUlZ2bDJiRi1QZ2VHaEFmV2tXa2g3akYzZTkyUGd0bkJGekRFRF9OWDVkVnVFLUFzTlFoZmpOM0k0cEROYmN4U1AxcERDYU9EeGRIUVJZclp4OFdfNGc9PQ==
some companies get more value out of employing chartered engineers especially if doing infrastructure work for the us market as they can have their own uk chartered engineers sign stuff off in lieu of a pe signing it off some companies block progression to senior engineer roles without ceng status atkins realis for instance are unlikely to even discuss it without chartership,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOEluSnlFa2RuLUJ4Y2lXNWFweVBmOUhkY1QtV09qalNGRy0tRjdhQVNBLUpGRW4wOVdZUUd6Z1FJbVN0MktiLWlZcHhpUnRza09oVFVmcENDQVozV0E9PQ==

it is a club you do not have to be a corporate member or fellow in order to be a fully qualified and practicing engineer indeed if you want to become a member and be a chartered engineer then you must prove that you are an engineer and have been a practicing engineer for a number of years it follows that if you can prove you are a practicing fully qualified engineer in a responsible position then you will remain so weather you apply for membership or not the most useful thing for me about being a chartered engineer was it allowed me to become a european engineer certainly when the uk was a member of the eu this was a useful registration less problems signing engineering contracts in mainland eu countries when in europe was the only time i was ever addressed as doctor another title that is neglected or even resented in the uk unless you study medicine the uk institutes have increased the degree requirements to the level of a masters degree this failed attempt to get status that engineering does not have has resulted in very few engineers bothering to seek membership those who study for a bsc are already in enough debt as no recruitment advertisement ever askes for or requires ceng why bother,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcWQ4bGJNczdmenpDb3pJS2wxUTA2Nmw1a3ZnQnVacjVNN3REZ0x6SHE0NmhQekloTlktYlAxcmVUU1RYUXpvamhmU1RzdHp2UmlyZ2FlTWRsZWZRMjZQM2tOd09vTEZtYlB3S2JiX2ROc0k9

i can see them now im sure you could donate them to a library if you need to get rid of them quickly or cantdont want to deal with the hassle id definitely pay to have at least a few shipped to me i love older engineering books and have a bit of a collection if i can pick a few id pay for the books themselves as well i know scams are everywhere so i really dont buy much online anymore if i can pay to have them shipped directly so youre not paying a cent out of pocket thatd be my preference if possible then i could pay you separately for the books as well let me know what you think,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWW1oS184b1lHcWVGQ3d1QnhaeHpnNnFnQy0zM0lEQWZhaVd6THhiZDg1U2JFUkpsekdzNmd6VVhjUEo5aWNHcEx3eWtyN1dwZHhZajhzX3pDNjVxanc9PQ==

applying for engineering jobs so i need to start looking for jobs and trying to find someone to hire me when i finish my masters in integrated engineering next year to be honest i really have no idea what sort of engineering i want to go into i dont really know all the available jobs out there either this course has set us up to be project managers in a way but you obviously cant just go straight into that as a first job and i dont know what sort of projects id even want to manage so yeh i was hoping for some direction into what jobs areas or companies i could look into i live in the uk im awful at electronics but i suppose with some training i could learn how to do that and i dont particularly find the automotive industry interesting so id like to avoid those as for things i enjoy or im good at i find geology cad designing cfd renewable energy environmental coding although im not very experienced in coding process optimisation thats quite a boring one tho and research and development interesting,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabGxEZEFRTy1kQmZFdy1NQUdkQTdXTHRjRjAwSEdyQTMwQ1JjUWF6ZGtQVWRqbEkyc1M4Z3pNRV9QR2xfZUZsMFFUZU0xU21XMHRSN1BmUExPM2otMGRMbUtIZVJpc1d5UF90RlpKMDBfbHc9

you need to isolate the arduino from the static antistatic coating or some material soft cloths even a little bit of rubbing alcohol rubbed on the pvc prior could help reduce the static however if the arduino board is not isolated its going to still suffer or be prone to static shock do you have the arduinol board in some side of case or is it mounted directly to the pvc housing putting the arduino board in some sort of case should help you prevent it from being shocked might reconsider your design there are a lot of details from your design that would be helpful in diagnosing your problem how youre mounting it wiring it etc,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZFBmTWcxYjE5bnJUZjNjaEJLZnpqV2tVTmMtUGQ4dXEzcy1jNlh0Mlh6OEpxbkczVWZOclhlN1FRWGFkUkN1MUZxYUJpM0lrOHpLczlHaXRmYWl2Qm5IVlNvUU9JSFVUMU8tS0I0Zmx0UWM9

you get a nut and bolt connect the ground of the boards and everything metal to a bus bar and have a nut and bolt pass through the chassis make sure you caulk or hot glue the bolt to seal it in automotive the common technique is to have the cars frame act as the global ground and have positives connect throughout,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZnFMdThVMzltUGZQQ2pVNHJncnlBV2Jhb0Y3UzIwNUVQbzVnVmVXQ29HbVJ6QW9xMDdOQ29fM18yNkZ3dW04N0Y1OFhMMjNpTnFXZlBIZGRVWEF3elE9PQ==

i once worked with a machine that generated a stupid ridiculous amount of static because it used circulating warm dry air to move plastic powder in vinyl tubing the static would arc across several inches of open airspace and it made a crazy popping noise i grounded everything to make it stop plastic output bag grounded actual machine grounded vinyl hoses grounded i trained a guy to run it one day he forgot a grounding wire he remembered when it shocked him in the zipper in his pants can you ground the enclosure with a conductive grounding strap so that while transporting it the device is constantly dissipating static there have to be ways to keep an arduino from being zapped constantly,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOG1ibzN2YUlvMDRCNVIwTkhQeklnd0xwR00wa3JyQWVSajlLSE1nVTQzODMwQlNWRXRnM0tHS0lUenBveGZvLUZxRFdjVHRXM3FFbXJiZ1Z5ZC1YbUE9PQ==

opportunities for a nontraditional engineer hello everyone i would love to receive some guidance and clarification from anyone with experience in an engineering rolecompany ive recently started pursuing a bs in engineering with embryriddle its a nonspecialized online degree in engineering thats abet accredited going to a physical school isnt possible for me as i am in the military and plan to get my degree before i get out i am curious how potential employers look at this type of education im worried that ill put in a lot of effort toward getting a sheet of paper that wont be taken seriously by employers i chose the program because its accredited but the more i complete the more i start to doubt the benefit does anyone here know someone who took a route similar to mine or received their degree from embryriddle or similar online programs i dont know any engineers and i am hoping that its not as uncommon as i think,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOTBHTk8yYkxlZnZIOW81N0VYWk5iRVFNb2g1XzczX2psRVFZSGx4b3pGYUN4cEVUU2N5UFJwWmFUSHJROS1CMUlZVzdGNC1iRmMwWUxlT1JKV0dhMmc9PQ==

yeah unfortunately you picked pretty much the highest esd potential material you could find acrylic will be better but not much polycarbonate will be better than that you can also look up esd dissipative coatings those work well as long as they dont get too damaged this is very much a real world issue its been a running subplot for the last year or so at my job to replace pvc fixtures with material that dissipates static,r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbVBIQTFRU2FTZXFjSmFIUWpZalFyb1FYUWlzcWZkdmlHZGR0N21xa1FKUmdKMG1pTDc1TV82XzdCVHlQSkEzb3RmVnVSSGZVajJpYWNSOWdUd1pfdXc9PQ==
