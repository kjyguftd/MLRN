> europe and to some degree the us have lowered their emissions in the last <number> years again thats ultimately an accounting trick as developed countries outsourced their most polluting industries to the third and second world countries with the rise of globalisation that way they get to shift the blame on countries like china highlighting that they have officially surpassed the us in annual emissions etc even the introductory wikipedia article i linked states many times that decoupling rarely works in practice and is far too little to avoid further environmental degradation pulled directly from the article > studies have found that absolute decoupling was rare and that only a few industrialised countries had weak decoupling of gdp from consumptionbased co production no evidence was found of national or international economywide decoupling in a study in <number> and below this there is an entire section dedicated to the lack of evidence for decoupling decoupling is part of a broader ideology called ecomodernism <url> and is the ideology favoured by the capitalists as it enables them to keep doing business as usual the main competing ideology to it is degrowth <url> which is inherently antithetical to the capitalist model which requires indefinite growth having read the book less is more how degrowth will save the world by jason hickel i myself am convinced that is the only path to a sustainable future,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaV85aHc1aHZ0MkJqTGFza1V3TjlGbS1sNVF4MjdhQVQ5S1RSUDUyYm5Zc2tqQngzbGp0MTg2WDNRV1FQX3puQm96SDQ0cl9GSWtLZ25QR2NKMnFoZWc9PQ==

>because the vast majority of chemicals in use have never undergone any safety testing this is overblown for starters we are simply being more conservative about what it means for something to be unsafe bpa is a great example are there concerns sure does it warrant using alternatives in plastics for storing food absolutely is this a big deal no no one is going to die or have an otherwise altered life we are just being cautious but read any news article and bpa is a dreadful toxin thats turning boys into girls chemicals that have significant toxicity cannot just be quietly swept under the rug without mass effect asbestos and actual mass safety concern could not be hidden away bhopal a massive uncontrolled release of methyl isolcyanate could not be hidden and denied chromatesdichromates despite significant legal obfuscation could not be passed off as insignificant pollution pfas have been around since before teflon was popular if they were of significant health concern we would already be seeing strong evidence of it sure this is a wake up call to control discharge of pfas into water ways and to monitor waterways for contamination sure it is a calltoaction to understand the biodegradation pathways and determine what environmental limits should be but outside of its flagging of systemic regulation issues its a rather tame issue even if there are significant impacts its no different from cfcs something that we can bring together informed policies to actually create change the politicisation of industrial effluents is a concern from both the left and right this should not be a political issue unfortunately the left going hellforleather with hyperbole on these issues pushes the right further to remove the protections that already exist this polarisation is resulting in terrible longterm environmental outcomes,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOVdYMW9LbUZLLURSTG4zbGNfY3kxd3hLeDR6Q2ZkcVdSWlZpRUZ6QkdfZktGaEd0aGZINFA1NXZuVC14SFZyRGRFSDMxendvdEh2eWtqTXZmaEsyRXc9PQ==

we have a university campus that we did some engineering work for that has an aquifer underneath it we were utilizing it as a ground source heat pump loop extracting the water out of the aquifer at the top of the campus its on a hill running the water through various buildings heat exchanger and injecting or attempting to inject the water back into the aquifer down at the bottom of the campus hill it easy to get water out of the ground really really hard to get it back in at any reasonable rate even with really deep injection wells at very high pressures instead of going back into the rock the water finds it way back to surface around the injection wells unless it is very slowly done at which point you have to slow the process down so much that you cant get a good heat transfer there is a reason aquifers take hundreds of years to recharge,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaV9TMG9zSGpsanlfNkNVX1h2SFVOY1FEYUw0TEF4NTljM21NM3QxcHEtNnJQM2FsTjhBOEVjQXVDdE9tbTlEaHdZb2l6SElDOTFHaElMVU5WN2Z4RkE9PQ==

this is my biggest long term fear from threat of another trump term the damage to the environment will continue to accelerate remember in the debate when a kid asked the gop candidates about climate change and they all just denied it i dont know how youth can support these a<cur>hats,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbzJPNFJpZDJpY1lEbmtONXdoMDE5MFdwN1NsLXdKTl95b2JkcjRpN2cyNEsxOHpqSmFIMGdTWVNMS2Z6MTFsOVlkelQ3VFdRZ1JwckFKSkUwS0ZxTnc9PQ==
firstly please stop equating gdp growth with human flourishing gdp grows when governments spend money on chemical weapons human flourishing doesnt gdp goes down when someone quits their job with doordash to nurse a sick relative back to health human flourishing goes up gdp goes up when a town has to spend money to recover from a hurricane human flourishing goes down etc these are <number> different things the guy who invented gdp said explicitly that it should not be used as a measure of the success of an economy on the life has got better under capitalism so capitalism is good narrative this is a faulty argument that capitalist propagandists have put out for over a century firstly dont you think there was improvement in human lives before capitalism and dont you think there is improvement in human life outside of capitalism i am not a tankie but just to make the point if you look at the gdps your measure between <number> and <number> the usa and ussr had very similar improvements to gdp the ussr started from abject poverty so it never caught up but it made the same progress the argument is a fallacy its called post hoc ergo proctor hoc something that happened after a first thing happened because of that first thing in fact the place where it is appropriate to specifically point to capitalism as the cause is the rampant growth in inequality and the widespread destruction of the environment why because these consequences are built into the logic of capitalism by dividing people into <number> classes one of which extracts wealth from the other its inevitable that we end up with rampant inequality and because the supreme goal of every capitalist enterprise is to generate profits at any cost then its inevitable that the environment will bear the costs of the enterprises activity whenever that can create profits either by overextraction or by excessive pollution there are alternative systems that can mitigate these mechanisms because they take into account the interests of the people being affected by those potential negative impacts not as an afterthought but inherently in the decisionmaking processes honestly capitalism is not a system that deserves your loyalty and btw i say this as someone who employs <number> people in <number> countries i have no immediate material interest in making these arguments i can just see that this system has run out of road and i want my kids and grandkids to have a good life and i dont want to spend the rest of my life watching society collapsing into decay violence and despair which is what is on the cards right now,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTm8taDBzUW9HWUF3ODJ4bU1zYnh0MHllV0RWRXEzOU5LQXlldHpDNGw1aGg5b0NjN0lUeHhReVhRenI2NEdmV0ZaWGJYeWJxdlE1cDlHT2hvSGpxTUE9PQ==
<number> yes and two of the most ghoulish justices are retiring if the side that believes in climate change wins we can fill those seats with normal people <number> theres a massive difference you just said it yourself one side is trying to dismantle the states ability to act and one side isnt as far as im concerned thats a massive difference right there,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMmZ0ejA4SXQycmtaV0dmMkR2cXdVZF9KQk10RDdvWnExVUdqNmtkeWc5dnlpbDhqOUUyQ3pYUDQtRWFQZkM1RmdBSmk4b0VzcDNxb0ROOUNRUEM1U2c9PQ==
all the solutions to our energy needs are out there and improving all the time the barrier to transitioning away from fossil fuels isnt a technological issue or a matter of planning its because fossil fuels create huge amounts of money that money buys power and influence through the political systems and the media that is the barrier i say capitalism is killing us because it is preventing the transition from carbon fuels and because it will do anything to retain its massive carbon profits there is no credible capitalist route away from climate dystopia,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbXlGeE5RUjVpZ2RxYVpEU2UzVWVvdGppalBxc0tSbkVnSGpGVTBBMGtXd0EzcmtSMTlVOHRVU0FiLTNGc18xU3lhQWJaamlOMzRUYnF6LTBuOVRHQUE9PQ==

the glaciers in north america started slowly receding <number> thousand years ago obviously the earths climate has always gradually changed over time most of earths climates would not have been suitable for human life btw but man made climate change is altering the climate faster than at any other point in the last <number> million years its not just about warming its also about changing the environmental conditions sure corn or whatever may have higher yields if its <number> or <number> degrees warmer but how does that affect things like rain fall soil conditions life of pollinator insects etc i dont buy youre argument that climate change is a good thing especially when you look at sea level rise ocean temperatures creating bigger and more dangerous storms ocean currents potentially being thrown off forest fires animal life inhabitability of life near the equator human displacement and migration etc im also not just talking about climate change one of the political parties in the us is also trying to gut our ability to protect clean air clean water endangered species public land etc,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbUN4U05kczdSV2FQZ09EblMyb0dMUGd5ZkYtRFVGaG5fZEo5NkhrY284NzVXVEVtaUlNVXhQOGF6YUNHYVctVHlkaWo0aG1JZDhFMllzMmQtWkRDSFE9PQ==
to be fair its both the demand is stimulated globally by consumerism marketing and advertising in individual countries and profits are made all along the supply chain but of course china has its own responsibility to curb pollution it did occur to me though if part of this pollution is caused by production of flat screen tvs then it seems to me that it has gone up a lot less than the actual production ie a <number> increase in pollution sounds like its much less than the increase in actual production this article shows that chinas share of the market quadrupled in the <number> years following <number> <url> and thats before you include the increase in the size of the market i cant find figures but i would be surprised if production increased by x over the period so an increase in pollution of less than x suggests significant action to mitigate pollution in the process,r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQW5EODA5TC1TZGpmVDFMd0lVNmFqaThaU19MQVlxVEFrZHFpamhtcTE0OGxRREowOEd2Q1dhcjRvbmpIUUJ2WEVJU045ZjVTZzZONkMtbERqNmp4UEE9PQ==
