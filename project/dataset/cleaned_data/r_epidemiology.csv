its pretty rare and the incubation period is extremely long meaning youre likely to get sparse answers from observational studies someone could handle meat and get sick a year or ten years later what would you ask them maybe you could look to see if a case had ever been documented in someone who had been vegetarian for their entire life which would be suggestive of an alternative mode of exposure to straight up eating meat that brings to mind the outbreak of a pig tapeworm in an orthodox jewish community who dont eat pork which had been brought in by a sick domestic worker the fact that the jewish people dont eat meat ruled that out as the way they acquired the infection prion diseases were first discovered afaik in papua new guinea among people who practiced a very specific form of endocannibalism specific members of the family would ritualistically imbibe tissue from the decedents nervous system it took an anthropologist to solve the decadeslong outbreak iirc and was the first time prion diseases kuru in this case were described,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERjltZTdRbWVlVUVjUnVlaXlpNFRVOWxteGl0dGYxWGVmOGZYT3BpSkZkeGpZWWYyT1J6VTV4QWNkc2hSLTVUY0xxczRsNWFqMFBvQmQtZzFsQlh2VlE9PQ==

i seei guess the first logical step would be seeing if these human prions persist on surfaces and then trying to estimate from there,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEWFBSeE9NWHhrc3dhd2Fka3ZDcHFvbHFxQThHckRMcmpwQ3dFSWlaczg5WTBrNC1GTDdLYzBqaEVieHI4d0pzR3V3X3lRSnFCeWpHamtjVUJrT0NxbWtyMUdXVEQwRVd5MUs5c293dGZCZTA9
i think its also important to contextualize the transmission of a pathogen via fomites as well though when we typically describe transmission of a pathogen via fomites such as hand foot and mouth disease or adenovirus it is usually in a way that suggests more casual contact think exposure via contaminated surfaces like sheets countertops shared towelsclothing doorknobs etc i cant really think of any reasonable scenarios where these objects would have prions on them someone please let me know if they can though edited to add that they can and do persist on surfaces but prions getting onto surfaces via casual contact seems unlikely and in studies that demonstrate they can persist on surfaces the prions are intentionally applied to these surfaces or studied in environments theyre already on such as in soil contaminated by prions by deer with cwd additionally these are not adequate reservoirs for prion infection as <number> people are not ingesting them and <number> these are not objects that are coming into contact with the central nervous system in the way that opthoneuro surgical instruments do in cases in which these contaminated instruments have been the source of infection,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQV9jWmxSYTBOY21hMGpxQ1M3N2hpMS1IQllDOGhGT0hfamd0bVBvbXVJT2JpQldNekNfc3ZHQS01YTFOcHVwUW1VUFN6ZVQxeTNwM0JLMmNQdDhuQU41d1poN1V0T1NjQVRJaEFDLTRIRlE9

valuable read thanks i was concerned in spaces within and immediately outside of labs or theatres that handle human cns tissue say a training facility for surgeons or something it seems reasonable that someone may accidentally get material on their person and transmit it elsewhere in a cadaver or partial dissection setting as mistakes happen thoughts on that would be appreciated if you may,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEU3MtMU5JdUJpeHFxX201a0w2S3ZwVmNPWjA5RE5zSmxlWkxyTGVRbHk4Z2M2b1o4V3M4dFQ1djZGM3laZ295UmhlYVd4VEJLbjY0aU1wblUtdEo3eExDZVFRY0UwX0p5aDNyMjlfN2xBbU09
well kind of depends on what you mean by persist prions are proteins so you cant kill them and they wont just disappear as i mentioned before you can fully cook a piece of meat with cjd prions and still get the disease so they are resilient to some things that kill or deactivate other infectious agents viruses bacteria parasites there are different types of evidence in researching health phenomena basic research or bench research is what youre talking about looking at how things work at a cellular level in the lab epidemiologists dont usually do microbiology although some have an education in that subject we tend to look more at patterns and linkages in disease status among humans in the real world like i said if you were to diagnose cjd in someone who had been vegan their entire life then that would be evidence that you can get a prion disorder without directly consuming infected meat i dont know if any evidence of this type exists out there but its an example of what you would look for,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZUdISC12b0NDUjlBYzZtSDRBOXNacnJ6MVBNQ1dvVDhtSmZ0TjY0ZVl2aVhydjJ5R1JGY2c0Umc0V1B0RHNaYl9MeGd5cXlWNUpzLVZ3dFZmam1HdkE9PQ==
a lot of the intro jobs seem to want at least <number> years of epi or data analysis experience sometimes professional experience plus the degree is an allowed substitute i dont like it but that seems to be the way it is for a lot of positions i will say its great you already work for a health department is there a way you can do an internal transfer to a new position maybe reach out to the epi department directly or use a work contact having an in or knowing someone will really set you above outside applicants other than that if you want a semi introductory experience to data analysisresearch have you looked into research assistant positions at lots of hospitals and medical research orgs or clinical research positions clinical research coordinator is a good entry level post but you may not like it if you dont like any of the admin side of running studies it can be challenging good luck,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbjdwZ2lQQktQVk84d2FXR2dvNUdJMHhBcGFnY09SNkZxNXhKaXR1cHl5QXYtdE9ieFJYS05Td0ZGaTJjMjFvVnVicnJodFluUzNzcDZfLWxlZ1J1S3VLQWtadlZoRTdlY3R0Z1hUbU44WFE9
i found this page on prion infection control to be helpful in thinking about this question <url> according to ucsf there have been no known cases related to occupational exposure so theoretically it seems unlikely id think wed likely see higher numbers associated with healthcare workers who are exposed to infective tissue if this were a more viable transmission route this may also be a good question for a microbiologist as theyd have more information on the biological factors whereas as epidemiologist we are looking more at relationships between exposures and diseases,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEMTNmNG9OdlJrRzR6ZzhvUXB6Q0ZXbDNXYnptbHRKb1FZaWFWblgxVERvRnhpWldhcGs3eVA0RTRzZTZQYk42WlBuS191UENFYW55a3UzWjVMWi1FcUtjZW44ZHl1RHIxM19mb1BCQUpWWFU9

is your mph an epidemiology degree or a different discipline like environmental health etc have you taken another epi course or is the your first one are you enjoying the class even through its difficult do you need the class to graduate how much timeweeks are left in the course can you reach out to a ta and share that youre struggling most tas are very open to helping you do you know someone in the class that can help you study do you have a career services department or an advisor at your school they would probably be the best people to talk to about this there are a lot of factors that can go into this decision and i would need more info to adequately provide advice,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNENlc4SnB0U3hsWVNFcjh2QVotelBER3JGTG9ucGlvenpDQVFYNmV0QVNUSFV0OG1uY09mdExNQnc0ZDl6cEZjc243SlVHYU4xcnRrVG15a2JGOG53SHJJaTJZRFVKWnNWQVBoNEQ1YmVLS1E9

yes it is epidemiology ive taken the basic population assessment classes but i havent taken any epi methods or biostat classes yet i am enjoying the class very much i feel like if i had a bit more experience with epi classes it would be a lot easier this class is one of the electives i can take for the epi concentration and theres about <number> weeks left for the course i have an appointment with an advisor in a couple days hopefully that will clear some things up and ive been reaching out to the professor for help on certain topics,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEYXNSMDktR0FxX3MtQ0tUTkk0cUNySzhLazRQZTVWUF95NjEwQWpuUlRNSlpKbE9HSmhTeDJ6TEREbUlKQUZyZEtNOUpqMWNibm1FYUJaRXRZREh2amV4cDJOaGFoM0RLSFNHZ0VzcjJOV1E9
thank you for clarifying thats great you have a meeting of your advisor i would hold off on making a decision until you speak with them but ill still give you my opinion based on what youve said and if theres only a few weeks left in the course then i would agree with the professor and say it may be best to withdraw if you dont feel like you can do well on the future assignments for epi electives a core understanding of the fundamentals both epi methods and biostatistics is really pretty essential to success i will say please dont feel discouraged or give up on your degree a passion for epidemiology is really one of the most important things if you enjoy something and put your heart into it the rest will eventually follow best of luck in your program,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEcFczX2MtTnZDUXd4b2Fpalp6ZjE5ell1WF9oTjZSODJWZUpMU3o1TDcxQ2xUdTc0aDVsX2V6bC1xcGJMbk01Y3hIdHNkNFNGeEY0V3NMUElRcnM2X09zdVBlX0dfM09aVzFaZWpaYnE0dEE9

at this time these have not been demonstrated to be modes of transmission in humans as far as im aware tissue outside the central nervous system has a much lower concentration of prions the study that showed that skin from those who died from cjd could cause infection in humanized mice used direct inoculation into the brain of the mice and it took twice as long for the mice to become infected vs the mice that were inoculated with the same patients brain tissue this was a very invasive procedure directly into the brain so it does not demonstrate infection happens from casual contact with an infected individual of course there is a lot about prions that remains unknown but id imagine wed see higher case counts in humans if these were efficient modes of transmission this is especially true for those who care forlive with infected individuals,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNGRGalBMVkdyVHFLMmp2ZElFeDhqNERqLVA0U2xMLW5xU1EtY3B4UmRPcWFQanRhNzNsQTVqUUZfcm1XQ2U2M0RpdTRsQndxaXFibUFPQm51V1hWeDhGaWkwbk81TE1CcWZYVzR5cmJ3N3c9

thank you for your thoughts i agree that in many studies they inoculated mice directly into the brain but i can theoretically see how people could get prions into their systems if prions stay on surfaces the touch on something witj prions on it and then scratch their eye or nose or maybe eat something or lick their fingers this study shows how hamsters get sick by just rubbing on and sleeping on the surfaces that had prions on them <url><url> i cant see why relatives of cjd patients would not be in great danger perhaps its the long incubation period that hides the real numbers of infected people there have been some cases of sporadic cjd in the same family i cant explain them other that through horizontal transmission would be happy to hear your thoughts on this if i may,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFMm1PTzFtWkpLOWYwZEJrWUFtZC0yRjhPRkZfY2psQWF3bHM4NWFPa1BTeDdrcklzQkZfMzQwbFdoemtnSkhBR2pBUVNrVDdIUmtCQ0pHUGt6Vl9BY2c9PQ==
different prion diseases spread differently in animals and humans id love to know more about the reasons behind this if anyone has good literature on it the study you linked refers to scrapie which is different than the prion diseases humans get the same is true for cwd which can also be transmitted through saliva urine and feces again this is a prion in deerelk not in humans as of now regarding relatives of cjd cases there is a genetic risk factor for cjd having someone in your family with it puts your at higher risk due to genetics not due to exposure to them,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFdTZJSWJudWJ0aDhvRm80UlVGTFhpeFVFSnVCWV9wcXZLLTh3RTRSZUl1d1ZzTElJdmRZTkxoUnJyakJZb1QwektBekxjY2p2ZnJqU3dyRzh6a2N5VzhyQURsanZyUmE3c2VkLUFvWHlZUzA9

it is a bit of an apple and bananas comparison mostly because alcohol is framed as an individual risk while access to clean water tends to be viewed as more of a community risk because of this published stats for access to clean water tend to focus on mortality rates by area or country or looking at population attributable risk of deaths to to the exposure the who<url> has a bunch of data on this if you are interested i think the mechanism between these is also going to be somewhat different too most alcohol deaths are going to be long term exposure versus acute events overdoses alcohol related accidents while for unsafe drinking water is more about risk of acute disease outbreak where everything seems fine until vibrio cholera gets into your water supply and then you get an outbreak thatl sickenskills a large number of people in short order another good comparison that is pretty well studies may be smoking risk this is an older cohort study<url> from a bunch of countries with lengthy followup that found a <number> <<number> cigsday or <number> ><number> cigs per day increased risk of all cause mortality for smokers compared with never smokers,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQSmVjUVFpdDFJWjlUOWZMbl9GWm5lSEY2WC15MFVxY2dnTzZ0MG1HS1pkaXZvdnZiSWNvWHJSUFkxeFpmSWs0ZXItZWdqd1JQY0k1dEQ0bTZ0U2NNcUE9PQ==

dont be nervous youll have a lot of other students and professors to help you for when you start internships take advantage of them while in school in my opinion the best way to get a job after your masters is doing well in an internship from a good working relationship with your professors they are knowledgeable about academiaindustry and can introduce you to someone who can get you a job or just generally provide advice,r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRUN5Q21HYWNvMEh2RlFPOWhPb3doMDRjd3RXZzZPZ2JTN3YxdUhSMmlFeTdwX3FKb2d6RThBRlhablFFeUg1U3ZCcFFXMDd4OTlUSGdrampMY004YUNacTNmMW84S3RIVnVRbVBnVzNiaGs9
