they came to the shelter misgendered at least one of them but they are two gay female cats i thought maybe the allegedly male cat needed to remain male for some unknown backstory so i just left it the black one definitely humps and bosses the forest cat around like a dude she doesnt like it and i feel it every time she comes to me fed up but they refuse to be separated without meowing and screaming cannoli will kiss schwarzwald so its not altogether one sided gay they are naturally gay cats this is not a western invention i had no idea when i adopted them but theres not much to be done because even though cannoli does not seem to like it she refuses to be separated and starves herself if separated the people who ran the place where i adopted them were extremely mentally ill likening themselves to some of the cats evil and sickening so maybe whoever gave them up were protecting them from them i dont know the backstory so i try to not assume the lore you know what i mean so thats the story of my two lesbian cats,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHZDd1V3Y4S3l6NVI5amI4OWE1Z0ZiR2RvMnFmS1ZsVWtueFRJSmtPM0RGNzlOMmtWYkV6MnFmRzFZNlljMDBZM3BfTzI3VTZyZVNueXNNU3hRczB3NUNzUGxzcFFQSUhuQWwyaGdPel9xUms9

i dont think anyone will argue that homosexuality hasnt always existed for as long as people have existed thats not the point the point is that the idea of a gay person as an identity which can be derived as distinct from straight is very much a new and western thing in the same way that the concept of a white race is basically as old as the age of colonialism starting roughly <number> years ago when columbus found the socalled new world no one is arguing that white people didnt exist before only that the identity as such became defined around that time gay people and gay rights are absolutely being used in the service of imperialism today not unlike feminism whenever the west wants to bad mouth a middle eastern regime like lets say the taliban they say they dont let them go to school etc etc im not saying i agree with that but putins point and moreso alexander dugins point who is the real originator of these ideas within russia is simply saying that states must be left to develop in their own way and at their own pace saying that you the west reserve the right to invade and destroy countries because they dont align with your values is peak imperialist chauvinism especially when you dont criticize other states which also break these values but allow you to profit from their resources such as saudi arabia for example the point is to highlight the hypocrisy of socalled western values,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNRHF5UnZtY1lZQ3VkZTFwdjNsWUUtSDJETUNNZnIwd0pHTk9PWVAxVGExSFJhNkp2ZXhQSHlJemdoWmgzdEZ3WDRUanJ6V2JMZlNndzk3NDNIUE80eGRDS1NOQmpTZzlfM0hBTXc1T1BhS1k9

afghanistan iraq north korea vietnam china opium wars mid th century philippines spanish american war <number> haiti mid s cuba failed attempt nicaragua argentina indonesia some of these involve giving weapons and money to vassals within the countries who would nonetheless sell the countries resources to the us same effect but no american troops on the ground,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNOThYU25sSlN1S01YcC03Q3NUaE1PZTBua19ZdmJWQ255V0gzVlU0d25hU2toTVdZa0k0QkNjRG9zZzdHcXV4X3FDM3FjSlNOY3hVY1JUZ0FRcVdodldjRWI1dC1TOGd5Q1p6dXJIRFh6NzA9
the larger point is that in all of these cases even like iraq where the stated reasons were different the foundational premise is derived in a notion that the people are unable to perform democracy in a way which the west approves of and therefore must have democracy imposed onto them this idea also takes place in countries the west doesnt have direct conflict with like iran but is used to justify economic wars such as sanctions which cause poverty or a direct blockade like in the case of cuba they dont have human rights according to our definition so lets starve their people in the hope the people destroy their own government,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNT1hSQ3JxRnpOcjlSTzVDQWJpcEluQmN3MHRrWUZjR21ISmhiZHNLLW5OcVlnWlJ5aTdOY29Xc0Y3NEhtQnBGUW1TTTBBMWJmWWo4cjFLcWk5VDVMcG5QcU53SEJoX0lLdlA5ZDNTMnc2YVE9

after the us left afghanistan in <number> they froze about <number> billion dollars of money held by the afghani central bank in us banks they still have not returned this money the us does not recognize the taliban as the rightful government of afghanistan so they are not giving it back it has been estimated that food scarcity caused by this economic catastrophe basically one country stealing from another caused more deaths by starvation than died during the <number> years of us occupation at the same time immediately after the taliban took back their country articles started coming out in the west about how they dont let their women go to school or how they are killing people who collaborated with the americans and how this is an affront to human rights how can it be any more clear obviously there is always more than one reason for taking a certain action but the idea of human rights whether youre talking about women or gays or dissidents are always used as this excuse to create tension you cant say in your press we arent giving the money back because they wont let us mine for precious minerals this would make you look bad meanwhile other countries do exactly the same thing african states like kenya and uganda commit the same human rights atrocities but they allow their country to host military bases and work with the united states on other projects so they dont get criticized,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNUTMwUHJKVFJ3aW1WenRreF94Q0xnY3FRQmNtMl82ejl4QkNzTEUySHM3RUlPRnJWVnZUU203MTBMWk9BcUhFakNpcWVid0FJRmNjVk1lN0JLb1FONEFvVHFDWF9fd0ZJMGI3Q01FWkRHQkU9

the taliban are considered a terrorist group in most of the world of course it wouldnt be smart to give them the money that was earmarked for the afghan government that was overthrown by force its not the talibans money the taliban didnt earn or produce that money if they want to raise money they can sell the weapons the us left behind,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNQzY4c2VrU2FxN1MyWHRkdmNONUJRcWxWRHQzWHZUdFNxWDAwZGh0ZnFPVWVsd0VhNGtHV2Z3ODZXc25jTUpvYXAzM3JDMmI3VlJTRmRjS2RmVEJydVdUdG9mczNtQ2JYc3Rkc2VwbDFrdUE9
thats not what the article says but interesting spin the taliban said they would be open to handing bin laden over to a third party country if the us proved he was responsible and if the bombings stopped they had already rejected an ultimatum of handing him over directly to the us to claim that they offered to hand him over on a silver platter is completely disingenuous,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNUm50aGViMG0yZDROdjh6SkJ0Smg2eGF0bXozVy14TlVFWS1ZUFN6MHNQeU9aMl9mQUg5Z3U5c2tacXlhdG1SeEd2NkdSaXFRNk0zdzAyZGpaRVRJQ1M2U01JaUpiZUJJQUpXTHpNeFIwNFE9
and where was bin laden found in pakistan literally down the street from a military base pakistan of course being a socalled close ally to the us funny how that works huh my point is that in the propaganda and jingoism that takes place during any conflict on an unofficial level there has always been an element of they are dirty savages and we must go and civilize them this is part of the process of manufacturing consent for war obviously the official stated reasons can be different right now in palestine people are shown pictures of dead children and the standard western response is well they were probably gonna grow up to vote for hamas anyway,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNd3NMMjNrQkpURE9sS21UNXlJRE42VVN0Y2Zkbmw3NGZYWGVYOElwMmxLYTBzRFdIWTFBR3NlT1RUOUQtYXJjT3dsRkIwMXFVRnhTclUwQWFfLV9CZzVwb0lnTWJQNkZvQjV1THdZYTlvd3c9
the point isnt that the us itself doesnt engage economically with a country the point is that they tell other countries third parties that if they engage economically with said country there will be consequences usually more sanctions the best example i can remember of this is what madeleine albright said in the mid s about the sanctions against iraq happily boasting about starving k children to death so that dictator saddam would leave power which of course he didnt because guess what sanctions never produce the effect they want they just cause meaningless suffering and dont affect the ruling powers at all,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNNnI2N2hBenU4bnZOaHNWUDJ0aEZiQl9YRHVqWjg1MVB1azA5Y04xNE1vQkUzNFBpUy1zT3Y2cEVCS0tROWtFRzJUZHYxd0lzZUlOem8tQTJISkF0Y09jWU1td0NCcEVzZUg1bmR5amlLNlU9

i think focusing on chinese employees may be similar to the suspicion that fell on japanese americans that led to their internment in wwii they need to focus on all their personnel for leaks and spies sudden enrichment honey traps kompromat not only that there is now a legitimate fear that china and russia can tap into the transoceanic cables and lift modify and insert digital information from previously safe submarine cables if silicon valley is serious they need to undertake a vast scrutiny of all their operations and possibly more importantly the us government needs to secure their digital databases and critical infrastructure that still relies on badly outdated security software and hardware,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOR09vdXRCVkcya3NXOW1hRnNPSHh3TEZtRG9mZ0ZZRFhVVnhIVnhhTTNhMF9NSGhSR1F0R19mNlFXWTBnWG1tcEFuaDNWLVJNVEw2UEdaSTN3Mlc4T1E9PQ==

it wont work in my opinion because chinese born individuals in my experience can a be persuaded to act for country at almost any time unless they have completely divested themselves of their conditioning growing upie changing their name to freeman because even being asked to have more children is something people are willing to do because the government asked them to do it based on what i have discussed with chinese friends here in vancouver and b theyre always vulnerable to coercion and force because of threats that are made to their family back home either to their status their jobs their homes their security or their freedom so youre not looking for patriots youre looking at a people who are vulnerable to fear and obligation in a way that is not deeply understood in the west,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOUkY2RkxWSE9lWVRGT25lOXpVejBsMUQwYVJ5R19QNHhyR2htOW9DeWlweFIyU3ZpemU0V0FWX3VxdWh2LXZaQXh6MmNKejQwWjdKWjRKTElseXFZSmc9PQ==

i think better internal security in terms of limiting more stringently and tracking actively access to files or information levels of access to same being better secured better onboarding and incompany clearancing which would probably require training by specialists in intelligence i think the intelligence community has to work with corporations and it needs to be an active widespread effort like others i dont want to demonize anyone from another country but there needs to be internal controls and external controls within the context of a corporation and the corporations rights respecting the human rights since you ask added in the context of national and international security im a financial securities compliance nerd i have no right being in the sub but risk management and internal controls are something i do know a teeny tiny bit about honestly its teeny tiny but enough to know that it needs to be in concerted effort with greater collaboration between experts and the most vulnerable points in each country and each company,r/espionage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOcnBCT0JYVUFVc3FfcHk2NFRnOFlWS28tcFV2WXhHVWNHeEI2cF9VUzRNN0hteVBMdHh1YjdqR2NQcjI1MC1GNUFNNWZhYmZBTDZXVlJXMThRUW9rSGc9PQ==
