first a validator is not supposed to sign an invalid block and get slashed for profit the block builders guarantee atomicity of bundles and that was violated here also it wasnt known at that time that it is possible when you are okay with getting slashed thats like saying if you exploit a software bug to hack your banks server thats okay because the bank had the source code and everything behaved as coded,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTem1mNC1heVNNZnNJMmE3RVFudXl0blNOZFZKV1o5TTJ4UGdISW9Ed1hCU2l6aktaYXBaN2xoNGNDbmpDOXhtazVYRFZZejJpWDF3aFp5Q0k1ZGFBU1E9PQ==

they couldve been at a certain point of time but usually only a couple blocks like everyone else has said etherscan and other blockchain sites give you information on what the price to transact is at that time,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOGdCRWF0TkgyVm4xOGZJRjRDaDFwQy1NYW1kVDNnMm9aal8zdklDVi0waTBIUjBHNGJSS3d6MkhQNDVESW53V1ZnRVFPSDhRczEySmFfQTJPejRNQnc9PQ==
this question is old but still totally relevant and since none of these comments give a good answer i will give you one you have several avenues you can pursue and it depends on if youre trying to find a price through code of doing it manually if youre not trying to do it through code you can go to the chainlink website and see if they have a deployed price feed for the token you want to price if they do call that contract directly with the function latestanswer at whatever block you want for example you can send an http post request to your full node with data like this id<number>jsonrpc<number>methodethcallparamsdataxdbcdtoxfecdfcbdfefecbx that represents calling the chainlink ethusd contract xfecdfcbdfefecb and invoking method latestanswer xdbcd at block <number> x the problem is more difficult if youre doing it through code and therefore dont know what coins youll have to price and cant go searching chainlink for oracles in that case the easiest is to find a deployed price oracle that will give a price feed on any coin for example the yfi oracle is deployed at address xdedfdbafffeab and to get a price back you encode your function call as xba + coinofinterestcontractaddress dont forget to strip the x from the address of the coin before concatenating into the function encoding another example the inch spot price aggregators xdffbbfcfdbfbb xcbefccdddcecbabeabdb xadddaddfdacafb <number> inch has deployed <number> and you should use whichever one was most recently deployed before the block at which you need to know a token value the function encoding for the <number> inch spas is xdefd + coinofinterestcontractaddress + <number> look at the documentation for both of these if you want to use them because one returns price in eth and one returns price in usd there are also many other price oracles already deployed on the blockchain but youll have to google around to find them,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZnliZEpCUnVsam5velhqT1VsNkViMXEtY082cldGZU9Wblk2dlVyRHpFLU5WZEFFRm5GTHNBMXp2cmJHcWFtUG9fTTh2ZHJzZ3NJRzllVDRIVEx1MmU1R08tQmU2WTVMSWVWbFh4QVJRUUk9
you can use hardhat and simulate mainnet and not bother with testnet testnet is good for the preliminary final results to make sure things work on the actual chain but testing using mainnet is my preferable way this way you can test against all other working smart contracts on chain and simulate wallets,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUkpaMXJ2RnlOSlNVbWs1eFZZS0lGa2JNYVlMdzFNMUQ0SGdSYm9Hak5YbXdENy1tWGc3VEtxdlZoajQzb282MVRsUkpxTmt6ZFk1b0Rkb1FBdFZERVE9PQ==

what does this have to do with ethereum this is a robinhood customer support issue robinhood rightfully cant just access their wallets willy nilly it probably requires dozens of people to sign off on a multisig at once first in a test environment then again in prod fyi if they do offer to help you it will come with a <cur><number><number>+ usd fee seeing thats what other cexs all charge for recovery >i looked up if anyone else owns an eth wallet with the same address as my etc wallet and nothing came up the wallet addresses for any ethereum virtual machine blockchain are the same eg eth etc bsc so on you can deposit eth into an etc wallet address and vice versa if you sent evm coins to a robinhood evm address they are currently in custody of it rh will still need to manually import their etc private key into an eth wallet to access it though suppose you sent coins to the wrong address by mistake even <number> letter off or to a nonevm address then no one would own the address since that would be statistically impossible there are more possible addresses than there are atoms in the visible universe and every one of them is valid searching for who owns some random inactive address is moot luckily for you eth and etc are both evm chains so there is still some chance at recovery in the future never rush a cryptocurrency transaction they are not reversable always send a small test amount first as an insurance policy if youre ever even a little unsure once the ><cur><number> lands then repeat the exact process using the full amount probably wise not to use rh either for numerous reasons just imo hopefully you didnt lose much youll have to chalk it up as a textbooklearning fee unfortunately keep stringent records your transaction id wallet address address deposited into date and time rh account information for when robinhood eventually does offer a recovery service if it is a substantial amount you may need to pursue litigation to force their hand,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTa0c3aXhvQjZCWS1jVWZ6Y0hDMmktc3FaS0xWZG5saERuVG0yUFp2dmJJNloyTzV3SlhyWFdqeEV6MVdzN3AzZFNZY1BGVFZ3S3cxenY5b3hmMy1DMkE9PQ==

yes it should go through if the gas price goes down to <number> gwei i dont know when this will happen though <number> gwei is very low theres an extra complication in that the gas for a transaction is comprised of <number> parts the base fee and the tip or the priority fee if the tip is very low its possible that miners wont include the transaction even if the base fee is low enough in theory your transaction can float around indefinitely until the gas price goes low enough at which point it will complete although if not even a single node continues to relay it around the network it may effectively disappear as if youd never sent it if you want to speed it up you can send another transaction with the same serial number nonce the wallet will usually label this something like speed up be aware that if you send another transaction with a higher nonce that will also be queued behind the current one as the nonces must be processed in order if you want to forget about the current transaction and make a different one the wallet will normally allow you to set the nonce manually to be the same as the current unconfirmed one this will replace the unconfirmed one if its gas fee is higher,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSlViY1FYVmtCZzJGUUVIWVpQd1QyZ1dHRk9pZ01VZDdobGJ1bWZuZEY1RUNhdjdINzNuMG5RMXBDRTdjVl95S1I5cWpQdVM1TlA0YmUydHViN1EzLXc9PQ==

eths code complexity is a tradeoff not inherently a flaw before eth there were a bunch of different blockchains springing up for superspecific purposes you had btc for transferring value namecoin for a dnsregistry type thing monero for private transactions and a handful of others for various purposes each of these blockchains were fairly simple but they had significant challenges first and foremost every blockchain had to draw enough hashing power to provide meaningful security a chain with small amounts of hashing power could easily be overpowered by an attacker and different chains would be splitting the overall hashing power so chains would have to compete for miners to make sure their chain was adequately secured this made it hard to get any decent ecosystem of chains with decent security while each chain served a small specialized purpose having small special purpose chains also makes interoperability difficult if you wanted to trade btc for a namecoin domain you could do an atomic swap but you had to get both parties to the transaction online at the same time to negotiate the trade theres no way to just set up a purely onchain offer that anybody can take for the right price ethereum solves a lot of these problems with the tradeoff being code complexity ethereum gives us one blockchain to secure initially with hashing power later with pos rather than a bunch of chains that need to be independently secured anyone can write their own smart contract or system of smart contracts that are secured by ethereum without having to develop their own blockchain client and figure out how to attract enough miners to their cause to provide meaningful security and smart contracts can make calls to each other trivially avoiding complexity like atomic swaps that complicate interactions between systems,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUeFBOU3FUWHBnYm5yS3VwMmVHdHgtbFZ4Y2IzN1A4V0gydjVvZW13YjhOTG5jeVdBTTRtd2hzaU8yYWx3WUJOWURRb21QYUVLa1BGMkRwajFGZ1AzQ1ZLVHluM3BnekZnZC1Qdmc4SlZYUkE9

ive worked a little bit in goethereum and to me it seems like a lot of unnecessary complexity has been added very recently i first considered using older versions but now using recent ones for now the problem isnt the codebase its that the protocol itself has been changed and probably not in a good way part of it is the chase after scalability ethereum was a revolutionary technology it was already a complete product but still wanted to turn itself into some kind of sharded parallelized system so then you have the dank sharding thing that as far as i know could run as a separate service using state channels thus add zero complexity to the ethereum protocol and node codebase but instead it is being builtin to the protocol and validatorsminers are made to participate in it then you have to add a second transaction type and you need to generalize an interface for transaction types and with enough similar and unnecessary as in the protocol would work without it changes you get a lot of complexity the whole eip system too with changes constantly means you have codebases that account for all changes and when at what block or time they happened and then you get a lot more complexity that is not really necessary if the system was planned out from the start but have to be added when you change it on the fly that i dont think is too much of a problem its more things like dank sharding that is destroying the codebase and protocol i think,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSG5wd1FQZjllQjZHaFQ1bVIyYkVwS0Z3OGdQWTBzZW5ZX1lpc3RsNmx1eWJvZ1praGsxQUdHal9YWmFvaG5IaDBDM2hobl9QTXJteGdWcTFSVW5GdlE9PQ==
solo staking is not a security because youre usingrisking your own capital and doing the work of validating and running a node yourself on the other end of the spectrum coinbase offering to take your money and stake it for you for a fee could very well constitute an investment contract that could easily be considered a security the investment contract itself would be the security not staked eth as an asset but thatd be assuming a world with sensible regulations and guidelines where coinbase would simply have to follow the currently inexistant process to register with the sec to continue offering their staking services in such a world an eth etf that stakes its eth under management would be inevitable but for now spot etf is a very good first step towards all that,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUbjUyak9oZGF3bjVGWEkwTUJ1bEJyU3g5Ukt3QVhhMGtydG1nTE91SUFNR2F2ZWJ6a2stc3JZVFU1QmxzU09YbDNtenE2TDNPTlRsTGc5cWxRdHBIWGc9PQ==

wut eth issuance has nothing to do with gas fees eth price doesnt even have anything to do with gas fees blockspace fees aka gas fees are simply how much people are willing to pay to get into the next block say if theres lots of opportunities to make <cur><number> by doing a transaction the market will pay up to <cur><number> for inclusion eth could be <cur>m per coin and people would still only pay <cur><number> for inclusion in that case >at the same time higher eth price means high security budget which in a lot of cases a waste of budget waste of budget is why people are considering reducing the issuance curve in the first place ethereums whole schtick is minimum viable issuance which is why issuance was reduced from <number> per day to ~<number> per day going from pow to pos issuance could have stayed at <number> but as you say yourself itd have been a waste if the price goes astronomical which it has since the original pos issuance spec issuance can safely be reduced even further issuance is just used to incentivize people to build and validate blocks honestly it doesnt serve any other purpose why not l the ethereum roadmap is named a l centric ethereum it will be many years before the l scales even a little bit and by then ls will have scaled over x more if you dont like the plan there are monolithic blockchains as alternatives for everything to occur on a monolithoc l makes the requirements to run a node extremely difficult and theyre much more centralized,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUbTRDMmc2TUpIS2ZUY2NUQWlHdWJZWWZLTWtKN0VHUkpoa0k1bndEMHhIOHVhZGV1YmxTZmppcS1kdUdMckpEUzR6SUlGS0E4eVJ6OEY1LTRrY2NCOXc9PQ==

im sorry your english is not the best and im an idiot i still might not understand issuance has nothing to do with gas fees these are all very seperate issues to be worked on and they are all being worked on in parallel by different people each problem requires totally different solutions people are working on expanding l capacity now once <number> of validators manually agree to it the ethereum gas limit block size will increase by <number> but most people dont manually do anything this might happen during the next ethereum upgrade because the <number> increase will be the default in their updated validator software unless they manually optout for some reason <url> every time the gas limit is increased always people just end up making more transactions the term is called induced demand where an increase of supply naturally leads to an increase of demand the gas limit could increase by x tomorrow and still have zero effect on gas fees because people and bots will just make x the amount of transactions induced demand is why ls are the best solution for scaling ls are the result of many years of trial and error and research increasing the l blocksize again and again will only lead to centralization once only large data centers can maintain the blockchain yet still doing nothing to reduce enduser fees scaling the l is a trap so many other blockchains the so called eth killers have shut down permanently or become irrelevant because of this very appealing trap while it doesnt matter if an l is run on a data center or even if it goes offline because your assets always stay inside of the l the verge is being worked on right now too it basically compresses all the data going onto l it might be a few years out now ethereum can process around <number> transactions per second today after the verge maybe <number> or <number> transactions per second but by then ls will be able to process <number> or more transactions per second so most people will still be using ls regardless today ls can already process over <number><number> transactions per second for reference in short were reducing eth issuance to maintain minimum viable issuance gas fees are being fixed with ls already l capacity is being increased with the verge seperate problems different solutions tons of people are already working on it so dont worry,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdVpTS2pDZlI5Q0pHbGtnejlCMElTU0VGdWZqb0FfVi03eUZQdEI5Vzl4LTBxeFdqSWFSTXVMREwza25zcXBpT3dtaGlNLUEtVVFLLTdfRnN3dGVmalE9PQ==

youre looking at it wrong eth has always had demand the sec and etf application has been the single biggest roadblock to eths future the etf holds more than just price action it holds the keys to the asset finally being classified as an commodity this is huge for not only eth but the entire crypto industry as a whole by finally being classified as an commodity itll avoid years of legal battles speed up adoption help create clear and concise laws help price action and so on the etf benefits eth in every way possible but also saves the entire crypto industry including us investors from years of setbacks the market hasnt had good price action due to the fear of the entire us government going against it if the etf failed eth and all cryptos as a whole would look at multiple year long lawsuits for atleast half a decade,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUbzA3Qnd4dHZnNGRJTmpuSUZ0azBLcmwwNndPUGFVVm9NX1F5SlgwdmdlLTRRSU1yemZ3cEY0amllUWc0dkZrZUtwWVJhWFdhbUxIbTA1dFZMZklmQ2c9PQ==

>a log file with cryptographic signing that is posted to multiple places is probably more reliable ooohhh yeah i hadnt thought of that like i guess if you had encrypted information distributed in multiple places like some kind of distributed ledger that would be fuckin reliable shit got me there no one is inherently trustworthy there are only incentives and systems say i kept my log with <number> corporations what prevents them from changing it sure maybe legal troubles if they get caught but how would they get caught its your word against theirs unless unless they dont all change theyre caught off there isnt consensus blockchain validators have a strong financial incentive to be in consensus congrats you now finally understand literally the very first thing about blockchain just now for the first time but on tokenization it absolutely does not require that the line keeps going up it only requires that the token has value the block chain requires validation and that validation is incentivized with rewards theres absolutely no requirement that those rewards increase over time you just misunderstood dan olson who unfortunately misunderstands blockchain i was subscribed to folding ideas long before that video though so i can deal with a few undercooked takes the speculative value of cryptocurrency depends on growth just as the speculative value of tesla or apple or nvidia or ford or att or gold depend on the line going up that speculative value is the main draw for investors now though staking in ether effectively creates a dividend which replaces some of that but even now the value in blockchain isnt purely speculative heres one thing his video misses you also in an emotional sense have a position if you have chosen not to invest in cryptocurrency thats a position you succeed relative to your peers capitalism is inherently competitive if cryptocurrency fails you fail relative to your peers if cryptocurrency succeeds if youre honest with yourself you must see this reality i also have a position i bought my first ether at <cur><number> im considering selling soon to purchase a house outright that doesnt mean im right and youre wrong but it does mean that if someone in this conversation would be seeking vindication for their opinion it wouldnt be me and what else quite the gish gallop you dropped the oracle problem is only a program in a subset of problems for example its not a problem im the use cases i already have in my last comment proving that a video hasnt been manipulated since a given datetime is completely useful for say dashcams we know when the crash occurred we know the video hasnt been edited since then if it was hashed to the block chain the only other possibility is that the video was fabricated before the crash which just really wouldnt apply in nearly all traffic incidents this might not seem important to you now but ai video is still improving at a breakneck pace no oracle problem see maybe you should approach this topic with more curiosity,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWWGpHTXlGTDBBdlNCLXoyWEVGSlkxdldBNkF3Nl82b0U0R3hacXFCQzU0b1dPLWpkNS0xWi1KWGFKNndUQTZ0Y2ItNzI2OWxOb1hhYk1wSmVQZGc5OFE9PQ==

its a great read layer <number> solutions like cartesi and execution sharding both aim to scale blockchain networks but do it differently cartesi moves complex computations offchain which lightens the load on the main chain and cuts costs it also lets developers use familiar software making it easier to build on on the other hand execution sharding splits the blockchain into smaller shards that handle transactions independently boosting throughput however this adds complexity in managing shard interactions and maintaining security while cartesi focuses on offloading computations offchain sharding enhances parallel processing onchain,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiYmhTY0pRaENaMktLbkVQYzZXZ3hvcEdrc2RzLTNfNmFGbV9oamszU3J1RnYwNUUzQ1pycjVwZzJreWgxYlg3d1pyVFk3dm9kOUtaZ2hpNnQ1ZTlnMzBiZVJGVFFVT21mYlh4MndMZjlTbjA9

aero is an l so you must have been on the base network on eth to get back to your coinbase account you will need to bridge from the base l network to ethereum l then to your coinbase account im not clear where it would have gone from how you are explaining this but it sounds like it is stuck on the base network of the address you sent it to if you were sending to yourself you should still have it but if it was to the coinbase exchange you may need to contact help there for a fix if any hope it wasnt a lot,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOFJhQTBhenRvT1F3UG5wcVdHY2ZWYTR6RzJjWG92SDB5SUVrVjVleENwdDNtaVhDY1ZjbXhnZHlMTE00aWNCVmFjX2J0dE9uUmFRSy1LQndNMTg5UVE9PQ==

little correction on uobnoxioustwit if you sold aero for eth on l base it should be possible to transfer the eth directly to coinbase there is no need for bridging what i understand is you send the eth first to your coinbase wallet and from there to coinbase exchange for me the deposit address for eth is the same on l base and l ethereum so you should have received it you could look at the addresses on <url> to see if there is something pending edit i now see you send the eth to the address you originally received eth from thats a big mistake you should have looked up the deposit address on coinbase exchange,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOGtfRTlRM3R2QzZfWVV3M3h4RFkxSjRzYVlJQ3hWQkZDaWFiUHJMUWVTTWF4TThSMm9haVA0aFpQaEZlUzJnVGxyeUpMVzMwZlFRUERoRlhYV3BMbnc9PQ==

price is ratio and concentrated lp ratio is relative to the range yes price cant go back without you getting the other token back because the thing changing price is the ratio of assets in the range lp just think of an lp as you putting both assets up for sale if they take one they give you the other hence a swap the more they take the less they get as they trade at the new rate ie the price is higher as the ratio is if theres <number> usdt in a pool with <number> matic <number> matic = <number> usdt people arbitrate to match prices to elsewhere you set your range to concentrate your assets more in rational prices so they get traded more and earn you more fees if its outside your price range do you think price will return if not with draw and sell some to make a better range you have more of one token than when you started as you effectively sold one for increasingly more of the other up to the top price in your range incrementally of course you get the other token back if price changes as people giving it back to take the other back from you is how price changes you want fees to out earn the decline in your asset value,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkQzhMNlNiejk4S2FtWlY3WjRLT1VBTERrcjNna3RYZUFRM252LV9BMld0dVB4c3Q4UHdINk5acF9uX3h0TGpvVWZHVTNnRjVmLUZOR3Z5ZVJiM3U0WEE9PQ==

would you prefer more optimistic protocols optimistic rollups assumehope everything is valid and give users a <number> day delay on withdraw to contest problems instead of prove everything is valid using zk straight from the getgo even the ethereum virtual machine evm will be replaced by a zkevm once the tech is robust and battle tested even optimism is going zk despite its optimisticsounding name zk tech is as much of a breakthrough as blockchains themselves even offchain protocols secured by zk can be as secure and trustless as onchain zk is the future >so im wondering if we need that many atm how many insecure ls are there imagine a future where all of them are secured because theyre ethereum ls thats where were headed there will never be too many,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkcXUtZGl4cEZfTzBWMUZidE50M0xVZ3JPUklQUmVOdDhMTXdFVlB6QXhMdzdTcEtDUDZwSDExaFhCOEZlNFRaM1A1bE5EazR2NHlod19rNmRfc25BS1E9PQ==
first there are two main types of zk proofs zkstark and zksnark and secondly there are many ways to integrate zk standards into a given protocol whether that protocol is something to do with ethereum an l or whatever the different ways of doing things are all an opportunity to experiment and look for different results and tinker to develop different methods that are variously more user friendly more secure faster cheaper fees etc none of these things come for free so there has to be a balance and discovery of what the market wants the most also the different platforms have a different degree of evm compatibility some are fully compatible which is a plus but tend to have weaknesses like being slower others are less compatible which is a weakness because it takes effort to port an evm app to them but they tend to have other strengths like being faster from a software development perspective each of these different methods provide a different platform and different use cases for dapp developers to try different things so each zk project is promoting themselves and trying to attract dapp developers and eventually come out on top in the end its all healthy competition and good because many people are trying many different things,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTm9zOWNhY0ZiRDh5ZDQ5cWwwU3B2YnBwRVhPQXhlZmRfUm14SWU5OEJvdkhsTkczWGZFbGo0LXFNRExBTXpzV29IM2VuT2RzZWNtMUVONHM1TEtMWFE9PQ==

i have little interest in the cryptocurrency parts of any blockchain but the use of blockchain as a technology for decentralisation and incentive alignment opens up a new design space you could build a totally new kind of internet around it to me ethereum is the vhs of programmable blockchains there may be other more performant blockchains the betamax in my analogy but at this point the ecosystem around ethereum and its ls is unmatched that said i think well start using other decentralisation technologies in tandem with evm in some cases,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSzd5aWExbFh2eFhCUXVQWTlwZU5LWGl0MDgxSFV1bFVESjk3MU54NzJ3T2FDR0FYOG51YnBYYlk0SDhyVGZRYmZLZDBNSzZYZ3RGeTFBNFVmbUFGREE9PQ==
thanks eveyone for contributing but i have to be honest not a single comment attacked my logic with any intellectual honesty the whale vs shrimp poster despite being theoretically accurate yet conveniently overlooks the realities of the real world honestly i was expecting some pushback from the paragraph in brackets this is where my knowledge is a little shaky i really hoped i would get holes poked in my understanding of the way these staking tokens work also i hoped that the level of intellectual discourse would be higher more mature despite the insinuation i am not a bitcoin maxi nor and i an ether maxi i am no maxi i am a curious crypto traveller who does not want to close my mind criticism of my beliefs i do not assert that bitcoin is free from whale manipulation all markets are but from a structural point of view it resists centralisation from a design perspective pos is a design choice that directly opens the door to whale manipulation have any of you heard that the eth etf approval in the us is going to prevent holders from earning the staking rewards quick question do you think coinbase assuming they handle the custody of the underlying eth or blackrock the etf issuer will not stake the eth they will hold if so then i have a bridge to sell you,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldzZOLVVWSE9QZS1FSlRaTzhfSURFa05BU09RZkk1aC1vdDloLXNKd0IwUFdFMkdkU2o5NlE5MXdZOUZqMDB1R1RzN1YteklxcHktLUdaMERrWTc2Vmc9PQ==

what issuers custodians etc can do in an etf is strongly regulated if the eth cant be staked it wont be staked etfs are very strongly regulated they make tons of money in volume not by cheating regulations the whale and shrimpy argument is highlighting something very important that you should think carefully about centralization occurs due to two factors primarily barriers of entry and economies of scale barriers of entry are the fixed costs to participate for example when your bank tells you we cannot give you access to this very nice product because you are not an accredited investor thats a barrier of entry it keeps shrimpy from being able to play the adults game where big bucks are made economies of scale define the shape of the returns as your scale increases when you are so big that you can negotiate energy contracts in bulk at low prices thats an economy of scale economies of scale make it so whale wins harder and harder as he becomes bigger ethereum has a barrier of entry in the form of <number> eth thats the minimum amount required for a validator and the cost of a consumer grade pc but liquid staking protocols get away with this requirement effectively reducing it to nothing and it has almost nonexistent economies of scale specially if you use a pool for mev by design the curve of rewards is extremely flat and anyone can participate in pow you need to buy costly specialized hw and your returns are highly dependent on your energy costs for which you have significant economies of scale to the point that mining at home the ultimate shrimpys has disappeared completely for many many years while staking at home is perfectly viable,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZm9aMG1PZE5qY09DZGcwenk3Y1lqMEswaUs4LWp4WTc1clViQkh1TU03NVJjVHJQN3lka2I0dFVHWkZMZVB5ZWlnT1luRDNHRVJlQUd4eDZscW5JY1E9PQ==

small players in a pos system are more nimble than larger actors and will therefore be able to take advantage of new opertuneties earlier and gain an outsized return a single person handling his own money moves faster than a billion dollar firm handling customer funds the larger players will also more often than not use earnings to pay for operational costs while smaller players will more likely use paychecks from an employer instead a larger player will also have a much larger operational cost since they need staff to operate the business while the smaller player is likely a single person transaction fees are one operational cost that will eat away some of the advantages for very small players so a player with say a couple of eth wont outperform a player with k eth unless the transaction fees are very low with proof of work small players do not have that kind of first mover advantage they also dont have access to the kinds of deals and partnerships that the larger miners have access to take for example the miner inn i believe it was texas that was paid by the power company to turn their miners off in certain periods that deal significantly reduced the cost per bitcoin mined for the miner that kind of deal simply isnt available to small miners which means that in the long term they wont be able to mine bitcoin profitably since larger miners taking advantage of these kinds of deals will push the hashrate up increasing the base cost of mining bitcoin up to a point that is unreachable by small miners,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTlZncUhXbmUxcDExRjBVQkl0MGl1RkxBUUMzNHJ1NGJ0Unh3NW1lbkUzVE83WFhpVXhXSno2aVVicVREQi0zTUt0dFFyT3A3VlpRWmJxSDdXRUdzVmc9PQ==
staking requires effort to set up node proper internet connection and keeping up to date with current events to ensure nodes are up to date the equipment required is also nontrivial for staking bigger stakers may enjoy some more economies of scale but they also bear some more risk as they can be penalized more if their setup breaks and are unable to attest for the network you need to actively monitor your staking rig so its hardly a passive income you should go and read up on the staking mechanisms of ethereum researchers are also actively finding ways to encourage more decentralized setups that may make it more difficult for big stakers to enjoy economies of scale compared to solo stakers the centralizing power of ethereum staking is much lower than the centralizing power and economies of scale of bitcoin mining with the halving and unclear path towards a sustainable miner revenue in the future only the most efficient asics and people with the cheapest electricity can mine bitcoin eventually it will be come so centralized that governments can easily find these mining farms and control or shut them down if theyd like to sure other miners will come in to fill the void but the network will already be easily disrupted,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZ2tJektDM09uR2J3cWNYcFl6RUVVNDY4R01HX0pOd2E0NVNpcWU0YVZpaTRQRk1wc1UzNjdQaHFBTXNVbTZaZ1U5a2JEV055N2hZaW1jSzVIN1NPd3c9PQ==

i am sure you all have heard the argument from the bitcoin maxis that eth is totally centralized due to proof of stake and how bitcoin is unique and special because anyone can do it of course thats poppycock because you need to buy a hugely expensive specialized mining rig to get into bitcoin mining and the rig will be obsolete in a year or two and there is a near monopoly on the manufacture of the miners now we learn that the manufacturer has spent years selling intentionally crippled hardware to the rest of the world while keeping all the fullyfunctional hardware for themselves meanwhile they appear to be running a bunch of miners under different names to hide their ownership im not going to say bitcoin has been irrevocably corrupted by the hardware manufacturers but this revelation clearly shows that centralization is a much bigger problem for bitcoin than it is for ethereum,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsVHJKOUhPaFhpdWxZX2ROTWQyRm9KS3RzaF83ZjA4SHJnLTJBemt4eTcyeWZkMEpCTTVkeV91R0lTWC02Ynp0SlRJNmNSTFpXcy1pbVh4eXVmZFdCZFE9PQ==

for a simple transaction an out of gas error is typically caused by setting the max gas too low max gas is something you shouldnt be messing with in general and wallets will estimate it for you by simulating the transaction alternatively the address you are sending it to is a contract that is doing extra logic when receiving the eth but i doubt it if it is a gemini address in order to help you further id like to know the address you are attempting to send eth to and the max gas you have set you could tell me your public wallet address but that may be unwise if you want to be anonymous,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuQzhlVkZ1bTAxbTZiYUZCdkJOMU1pdDVaUE1SaHlWTHdsUXRieElaWV9SVUhCeW95NnpFUUJTaHZ5WWdOZzI5SHVBU2ZRdERkRFl4Tks5LS1iR3hmX2c9PQ==

just note that by posting the transaction ids you have revealed your address and where you were sending the eth as you have a decent amount of eth make sure that you dont reply to any messages offering assistance im not exactly sure of your issue but its probably an issue with ledger live or that youve altered some of the gas settings you can use the numbers here <url> set the gas limit to ~~<number>~~ <number> but really you should be using your wallets suggested settings,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuSkx2dFBLM3dkQUM0UFlBU2pqMnVqVGRmTmZRbDZFNUpsS3FTaU51MzBkc2VKdDg0NVgzVnRENDM2bTE0d1JuTDVZZWxVSHlsaFlsNW9fVm5qejZ1b3c9PQ==
there are <number> main settings involving gas the gas limit and the gas price the gas limit is the maximum gas youre prepared to use think of it like to drive from home to work i need <number> litres of gas if you set too low a gas limit your transaction will fail because youll run out of gas before you reach your destination the gas price is how much youre pay to buy the gas like i will pay up to <cur><number> per litre for gas the cost of gas varies from block to block if you set this too low it wont get in a block for a long time of ever since your transaction is getting in a block even if its failing youre already spending enough so you can stop futzing with that usually the wallet will deal with estimating the gas limit so you dont need to worry about it but there are some weird cases where it may get it wrong the simple way to handle this that will probably work for you here although ymmv is to look at the block explorer for that address look at the transactions that actually get through and use the settings theyre using looking at the successful transactions for the address youre sending to i see that the successful ones are setting the limit at <number> or setting it higher eg <number> but only using <number> whereas the failing transactions which i guess are yours are only set at <number> so try setting the limit to <number> or if you intend to leave some eth in the sender address anyhow then just set something a bit higher like <number> just in case it wont cost you anything to set a higher limit as it will only charge you want you use but you need to have enough eth in the account to pay for the maximum you set,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuQ0JNX0xiRHIyd3JZaWl4Y1ZWVXpNSnJCUFdwSFQtS1VkQjJ0MzJyTzEzQ0ZjM1ZkZ1hBSk9xWWxXVkFiUmxvbFg5QkNKVVdnSzdFTUhYMDBjd21oRnc9PQ==

this is a helpful analogy thank you so in other words the max fee expressed in gwei is the price per litre of gas and the gas limit is the total amount in willling to spend to get the trx in a block lets take a step back its all ether tho right so how do <number> gwei and <number> gas limit compare to ether thats where im not following,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUzZNOEVzNzh3a2ZVZzhCQ3RYTE5tVXVTR0VaRXhrNndWZG0xR0RZVlI0eS1CUmR1Zk5DTHZZX3J4YzhBaVFXam9ocUVwTHhUZWV3STNjdGN4V0lWSlE9PQ==
gas fee is how much are you willing to pay per liter gasoline gas limit is how much gas do you want to spend the contract you were trying to use needed a lot of gas and you set the gas limit not high enough this is like you try to drive from berlin to rome in one tank of gasoline even if you are willing to pay a lot for your gasoline gas price and therefore your tx will get included you are still short and wont make it a proper wallet will check for the gas limit needed not sure why that was not working in your case hopefully this helps,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJud3FDSWQ1SmlCajgyYmpndHRuUXpxQ0FfMXllaUVLemVBRFBBMWdhUGlhWExHZHFadEVpaGZFSzF6aC02M01DdGI5dElxQ0hoWC15X3pTaVVoZDk3ZUE9PQ==

> so in other words the max fee expressed in gwei is the price per litre of gas right <number> gwei is an amount of money specifically <number> billionth of an eth gwei is short for gigawei the smallest possible unit of eth is called wei which is <number> billionth of a gwei so there are a billion billion wei to an eth > and the gas limit is the total amount in willling to spend to get the trx in a block close the gas limit expressed in units of gas so its more like the maximum numbers of litres youre willing to buy so if you used rounding down the example for easier sums <number> units of gas at <number> gwei per unit the total cost would be <number> <number> = <number> gwei divide that by a billion to convert to eth and you get <number> eth,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJueF9MaEVvc0JLeGU4T3dKeVl6SDF6eWNwV1NCVExseXU0MDg5U0FuR1NMdjVneHlveTlVeHg0eHVVV0hKQWdta1o2N1pjNS1wN1pJUTFhdzBMempubHc9PQ==
your gas limit seems to be too low only <number> which is no enough to handle contract execution on receiving eth the contract being sent to is not verified so i dont know how much gas is needed but i would update ledger live an or connect with metamask alternativly you can manually increase the gas limit,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNHJEbk9UX2NBMmhWRXU1MzJ6U254MkpNWm9pWkNIOWxzdnc3Q25TcXQxZElkalFHMk9GbF9jOWdSVDVWYTdMZzdLQzdCZzBCaEota1M2dUM5cVBXNmc9PQ==
will have to read through these i am of the opinion that change would be bad this late in the game the protocol needs to ossify changing tokenomics induces instability and uncertainty which ironically ultimately weakens tokenomics the only way i can see a change to tokenomics making sense is if were at a major security risk by not changing which were not ethereum issuance may not be perfect but thats ok because its not broken so dont fix it,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJueTJZX2dfWkZ1SWxHX1dJY1Z0WF9uTmxKbXBDVUpaV09yVFZsZHdxU2tJa2F6WW5nZGpYS01MeDlVZlJkWHBLUGxYWFV3ZzZaR2s4X2FyVkFwamsyekE9PQ==

the reason to do it is if you want to do the stuff ethereum enables but you really really want to use the bitcoin as your currency the downside to this is that the systems dont work theyre all fake you cant safely lock up btc based on what the other chain does because the bitcoin chain doesnt support it so they all rely on trusted parties which they obfuscate in various ways people could change bitcoin to enable it to do a lot more but thats against the bitcoin religion i suppose a benefit to ethereum of people doing stuff like this is that the evm becomes the defacto standard everywhere for everything even if the user insists on only using the bitcoin for some reason the downside for us is that when these contraptions blow up which they inevitably will as they dont work itll somehow be our fault,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuV0lRWmJCT1lnampIRTVGdUhMdzlpYjdnWkZvLXNMNWJpcWNLVEdCOWY1dndGT0t5OWNUMlJQTnVIZzRMZ3d6MGZqLXVLbzJHX3FELTlacFNEOWRDUVE9PQ==

bitcoin is close to its all time high but the halving just happened and even though it reached all time high past cycles over the last <number> years after the halving the price goes back to the all time high and does an increase in multiples what the multiple this time will be is anyones guess me personally i think it goes between <number>k so that is a <number>x the last cycles all time high k x <number><number> those multiples are lower than other cycles cause there seems to be diminishing returns if you take the averages of what has happened after months after the halving in the last <number> cycles it has gone up by like x and i think the last cycle it went up by <number>x the average of those <number> puts it around k to <number> million months after the halving i think it will be much lower kk to be honest either way bitcoins isnt going anywhere if u do buy be ready to hold ur position for <number> years if you cant do that and need the money earlier than rethink this through the last thing u want to do is buy high and sell low if it does drop after u buy just keep working and keep buying more until the next cycle u have to wait until the next halving where the supply of new bitcoins rewards gets reduced again which puts pressure on the price cause there is less on the market usually and u can recover ur money and most likely a bunch of profits the us government has approved the giant financial institutions to sell bitcoin etfs they have an incentive to hire people to go out there and sell these new etfs cause they have service fees from managing it so just an educated guess i think the price will go up over the next <number> years as for eth it usually follows bitcoin when bitcoin goes up so does eth eth hasnt hit its last all time high yet the eth etf hasnt launched yet either so i think it will increase by a bunch still my estimate if bitcoin gets to the lower range k or so i think eth goes to <number>k maybe a bit more buying the eth etf is a bit weird cause if you buy real eth you can stake it and get between <number><number> in eth so ur growing ur eth amount that was one of the things the sec said the etf companies cant do with eth is stake it and do the payouts or keep the payouts and it makes sense that they did that to be honest when you stake your eth you lock it up for a bit of time if you dont know about eth staking you should learn about it before u do anything like staking cause there are scammers out there you have to do it with reputable services particularly decentralized ones i think the most reputable one that is run by an actual company is coinbase if im not mistaken but they are centralised i think a good decentralized one is called lido you really gotta do research on this but ya its a way to grow the amount of eth you have by helping to secure the network and its practically free you cant do that with bitcoin if you want to take care of your own bitcoin and eth then buy it yourself and self custody it buy in exchange and then take it out of the exchange to your crypto cold storage wallet learn about that process if you dont want that responsibility then the etf works fine but ur gonna pay management fees it also goes against the ethos of crypto where you dont need anyone to hold your money for u u take care if yourself but u gotta be careful dont lose the keys dont use random software that can steal it get a cold storage wallet you gotta do research bro if u wanna buy some and be responsible for it ur self before setting up cold wallet and before the price goes up like crazy then use a reputable exchange like coinbase those guys arent going anywhere and have never scammed anyone as a matter of fact coinbase hold the bitcoins that the etf companies buy lol thats how much these guys are trusted good luck and welcome to crypto it will definitely change ur life if ur smart and patient about it,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZFlBMkNiZm9EZGQ4NXJ2UFN6MTIxOWdESjE2TlhDQVN1WEstTFV2d0x2dElwRm0tMlZXbmdxOHhmVGsyTXdpOTExdnM1QVAweUJheTNLaDQwVFpkM1E9PQ==

eli its like the gas in your car your eth car consumes computational resources just called gas for short gas limit the setting in your wallet is the amount of fuel in your tank that youre taking on your trip typically you should never adjust this current gas prices are based on how much congestion there is at the pump rather the roads the more demand there is for gas the higher the cost and vice versa your map ie smart contract should have an estimate for how much gas you need your car ie wallet will default to this when making a transaction rarely but sometimes the estimate is wrong you can look at how much gas other people have consumed to make the same transaction on etherscan for reference to send eth to another eth wallet consumes <number> gas to use smart contracts requires more based on their sizecomplexity and how much of the networks node storage space is needed if you increase the limit by too much eg set it to <number> but you only need <number> gas you will be refunded the difference if you decrease the limit by too much eg set it to <number> but need <number> you will pay the <number> because theres no way for the car block builder to know you didnt have enough gas before they did all the work like needing l of gas and running out halfway you still consumed that gas regardless if you made it to your destination or needing l of gas and consuming l you still have l left,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuaW1GTDJNRTB6MDVaT0xaX0stMjJVMVpNRC1iNV9ORWQySEMweW1uWEVDLWNzdWptS05KOVREbTNZMHZZdTlxUjBvUV9nWEtIbkRmRDdubjFkYWFkRmc9PQ==

unikolaj ucloudpattern the problem with these automated order making is liquidity slippage and fees with a cex the liquidity and fees are guaranteed almost always so the cex will execute them with a dex say like jupiter you might need to aggregate liquidity from different pools and slippage is the real issue so if there is a drop in price to trigger the trailing stop you might not get your order filled because slippage or liquidity issues i do use jupiter which is also very fast but when things are moving fast orders might not get filled as dexes improve constantly and liquidity is improving you could have them coming soon with dex aggregators but speed must improve i am guessing that with solana firedancer jupiter might get this for first,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvM3RsUEZ1VmRuRVZ1RE11cF80TjV0cGJEQ0pESDlYcFBwNHpCRV92MFFYX0luQUFDQnUtenJIV21scXNoNVZablp6OWdPSks0QzU4d19Bb09JQnJfUXc9PQ==

>why would ethereum needs to ossify what benefit does it gain from stopping further work done to it the idea is rooted in the desire to achieve stability and security here are the main reasons why ethereum might benefit from ossifying security and reliability a stable unchanging protocol can be more secure because it reduces the attack surface each change or upgrade introduces potential vulnerabilities by freezing the protocol developers and users can have greater confidence in its security and reliability network stability frequent upgrades and changes can cause disruptions and require nodes to update software continuously this can lead to temporary network instability and make it difficult for developers to build on a moving target ossification can provide a stable foundation for applications and services decentralization a more stable and unchanging protocol can enhance decentralization when frequent upgrades are required it often leads to centralization of decisionmaking among core developers or influential stakeholders ossification can reduce the influence of centralized entities on the networks direction longterm viability for ethereum to become a foundational layer for the global financial system it needs to be as stable and reliable as traditional financial systems ossifying the protocol can help ethereum achieve a level of robustness that encourages widespread adoption and trust user and developer confidence stability in the protocol can increase confidence among users and developers they can be more certain that the rules and functionalities they are building on or interacting with will remain consistent over time compatibility and interoperability a stable protocol ensures that applications tools and services built on ethereum remain compatible over time frequent changes can cause fragmentation and compatibility issues hindering the ecosystems overall growth however its important to note that ossification is a doubleedged sword while it brings stability it also means that the protocol may not adapt quickly to new challenges technological advancements or evolving user needs the balance between stability and adaptability is crucial and the decision to ossify would need to be carefully considered taking into account the longterm vision for ethereum in summary the main benefits of ethereum ossifying include enhanced security network stability decentralization longterm viability user and developer confidence and compatibility however these benefits must be weighed against the potential downsides of reduced adaptability and responsiveness to new developments,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSlRnTjJ1c3VoeG9vOTh4UjdSQlp1cnVGb1k1cDQ1WTBJV0NFVGI2NlFwWm1mQW8tN0l2WTQwbW92bzJfa1Jsc1lLbGEyVnlSWkZHUHR6d1RudWVvRUE9PQ==

cheapest is to use a cex send l coins to eg coinbase then withdraw back onto l into your wallet just be sure the cex supports that l first most do not all you can send a small test transaction to check this route avoids all smart contracts which are where the costs come in sending eth to an eth address is the cheapest thing that can be done on ethereum safest is using the native l bridge in your case the native arbitrum bridge but there is a day delay due to how arbitrum and all other optimistic rollups are secured,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvenhMWFVQLXNKdGZ0RFROQ2ZGTE5sRkNRRnRRU2VYc2tEM0ZNcnFsclBCN1AwMUp1ZWd3bG5BUGxTVS1iOE0xamYtaGpmV2hwcHJncFdkSlg0SFdyRkE9PQ==

> are all of these upgrades genuine hardforks in which somehow over <number> of the network participants agree yes most upgrades to ethereum are completely noncontentious basically everyone in the ecosystem agrees that these forks bring improvements to ethereum so people are happy to run the updates ill add that it is getting more difficult to upgrade the network over time theres more participants involved less risk tolerance less openness in general to upgrades i think most people expect the ethereum l to ossify at some point with most of the improvements happening at other layers ls avss other infra,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvWlZPc3UyWk9QUTJ6SlpzUTFDVktRZkt0a25wdTFaXzhxVlg4cmFaOGpMeXpZeTV0Nm1LazhISkhHM1gwUlliYTl6eXJnblpiQkFzRHFTcHdfdi12LVE9PQ==
upgrades to ethereum are difficult and take a long time to be decided on anyone can submit an ethereum improvement proposal eip and anyone can contribute to any discussion of any eip these discussions happen in public forums such as ethresearch and ethereum magicians anyone can spin up a personal evm to try out the changes anyone can read and contribute to the code on github as the changes are being developed only once the community has worked through all issues and come to a consensus does an eip have a chance at being included in an ethereum mainnet upgrade the eip is still not ready to be included though as each of the ~<number> independent client teams needs to implement the changes to their node software because there are many different clients written in different programming languages by people in different countries again this all happens in public as all the main clients are open source there are regular meetings of all core devs which feature the client teams the ethereum foundation and other key community parts such as ethereum cat herders these meetings are streamed live and allow developers to report on progress towards implementing the agreedupon changes then when all the teams are ready they set dates to push the update to a testnet once a testnet receives the update there are a couple of weeks in which anyone can try things out and check how the changes function assuming everything works the other testnets are upgraded again with <number> or <number> weeks between each one to allow anyone interested to test whatever they want and discuss any issues that have arisen that whole process from initial eip might take anywhere from <number> months to <number> or more years only then when all the testnets have been upgraded and everyone is happy that things are working as intended is a date finally set for the mainnet upgrade new versions of clients are released for node operators and validators to update of course if after all these monthsyears of discussion and testing the community were not behind an upgrade then they can choose not to update their clients and this results in a forking of the chain and anyone could choose to participate on whichever fork they agreed with a scenario where <number> of node operators and validators hadnt agreed with an update but somehow hadnt voiced their concerns while consensus was being reached is pretty implausible there are innumerable opportunities to contribute and the only barriers to providing input are competence and laziness,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdURWZmZQbkh4UzV5ZjRPUkx2UDJVQ0x6alVoZGxTOGhpMHNNTGVNWmdZZG5RU0NUNGlNSVkyWS1lVW5OZ1BjczNIR0NkaHZLNGFxMkoyMDNrYlQ3VUE9PQ==
its not necessarily difficult in coding terms as the blockchain itself is based on very simple fundamental cryptographic principles but any additional layers require many hours of testing even for the simplest upgrade or addition so its really the testing that takes the majority of resources as one mistake can cause untold damage just for context take a look at some python coding tutorials on creating simple blockchains it explains the principles and a simple chain can be coded in about <number> lines of code obviously after that there are thousands of lines to actually implement the different layers of functionality but the principles are exactly the same for all chains,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZDlyNDRqOUkyUWdOdXJNT295OXdHM0FlMEZmOUhzb2FfVlE0a0hMTjY3RDIzT05UVnh1NE15TnJnN2hVZEZwWTJ2N0d2V0JxeGhHZ2NDaEZKUjN1aVE9PQ==

yes i would agree that just because you decentralize something doesnt make it better simply placing the decentralization label on something does not make it better however by distributing ownership of protocols people can now own what they once couldnt i certainly agree that people would prefer to interact with entities thats because the infrastructure in which we have set up society is that of entities that take the responsibility off of our backs which is absolutely necessary to continue operating in the daytoday but i do think the more we can equally distribute the ownership of those centralized networks the more wealthy everyone can become the ability to decentralize certain applications opens the possibility for new uses governance and ownership of applications how much money has facebook made on my data over the <number> years ive had an account i dont know but i would have liked to have a share of that money at least if it was made off the back of my data which blockchain allows given its decentralized nature,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdzdDd2RRU0VUaUZEb2pSMWVncGlqZVlPaWx4T0ZvTklrSWJSUkFOLWlxdzJwRHlKcU8tWllNa0xTZmRaV0dCUkFfS0dwN19SYUZZN0FyQnJadXhaQkM3aHh0T1lYSk5tLTFPTS1ESEFob0U9

> i dont understand your point many of your arguments are very weak like what >heres nothing that stops someone from showing up to your house now with a gun and saying this is my house now yes there

the block chain is usable technology but if there is industry adoption which there already is becoming with etfs and the like the government could eventually adopt it the same this adoption is not what you think it is stupid crypto talking point <number> endorsements big companybanana republicpolitician is exploringusing bitcoinblockchain now will you admit you were wrong crypto has use cass eee tee effsone <number> the original claim was that crypto was disruptive technology and was going to replace the bankingfinance system there were all these claims suggesting blockchain has tremendous potential now with the truth slowly surfacing regarding blockchains inability to be particularly good at anything<url> crypto people have backpedaled to instead suggest hey it has usecases congrats you found somebody willing to use cryptoblockchain technology that still is not an endorsement of crypto or blockchain i can choose to use a pair of scissors to cut my grass this doesnt mean scissors are the future of lawn care technology it just means im an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available the operative issue isnt whether crypto blockchain can be used hereorthere the issue is is there a good reason does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using and the answer to that is no<url> <number> most of the time adoption claims are outright wrong just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government corporation or other entity is embracing crypto it usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said well look into it and that got interpreted as adoption imminent <number> in cases where companies did launch cryptoblockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some crypto project involving a well known entity that never got off the ground or was tried and failed miserably such as ibmmaersks tradelens<url> australias stock exchange<url> etc companies like visa fidelity or robin hood are not embracing crypto directly instead they are partnering with a crypto exchange such as bitpay that will either handle all the crypto transactions and theyre merely licensing their network or theyre a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat theres no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto its a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws <number> sometimes politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve this almost always fails<url> but again crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal while ignoring any followup materials that say such a proposal was rejected <number> just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesnt mean its the future mcdonalds bundled beanie babies<url> with their happy meals for a time when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money and the moment these fads fade they drop any association and pretend it never happened this has already occurred with many tech companies from steam<url> to microsoft<url> even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago proponents still hype the projects as if theyre still active <number> crypto etfs are not an endorsement of crypto theyre simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts these entities do not care at all about the future of crypto its just a way for them to make more money with fees and just like in <number> the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme theyll drop it its simply businesses taking advantage of a fad crypto etfs though are actually worse because theyre a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market if crypto was a viable alternative to tradfi then these gimmicky things wouldnt be desirable <number> countries like el salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really havent in any meaningful way el salvadors endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own nontransparent software chivo that is not on bitcoins main blockchain and as such isnt really bitcoin adoption as much as its bitcoin exploitation plus usd is the real legal tender in el salvador and since btcs adoption use of crypto has stagnated in two years the countrys investment in btc has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account also note venezuela has now scrapped its statesanctioned cryptocurrency<url> so whenever you hear soandso company is using crypto always be suspect what youll find is either thats not totally true or if they are theyre partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association not unlike an advertiserlicensing relationship not adoption exploitation and temporary at that weve seen absolutely no increase in crypto adoption in fact quite the contrary more and more people in every

i dont think you can adjust nonce using etherscan but could be wrong typically connecting your wallet there is only useful for manually interacting with specific smart contract codes to write your own custom transaction which youd then sign using your wallet on etherscan if you click view more details on a specific transaction it will show which nonce the transaction is you just need to input the same nonce in metamask or which ever wallet when making a new transaction to overwrite that pending transaction if you would instead like to force the pending transaction through there is typically a button in your wallet to increase gas fee in transaction history which will replay the same transaction including nonce only with a higher fee attached,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6MUlOTl9zTmJUUXcxaE9MZ2VJdkMyV1VEa1BvSmdxREY4LWJmSmVvVDJrenBMbkV5QlBLby1KODY2MUdpRXByV3Bzc0xQVmpNWExjSkRpYk9ORDQ3c1E9PQ==

<number> how do you include data of which projects you want your funds to be split between when sending a bank transfer if i want to donate various amounts to <number> projects do you picture me making <number> separate bank transfers with the project name as the reference or does unicef have to set up a different bank account for each project they are funding and then i send <number> transfers to different accounts with gitcoin or any onchain funding this is just one transaction to a single smart contract which is way easier <number> how do i know that unicef have distributed the funds according to the real amounts sent by donors bank accounts are not transparent so there is no way to know that the distribution is honest unless you have regulators or whoever checking the books which takes time is another set of people who need to be paid with gitcoin all the transfers are on an open ledger the smart contracts are open source so anyone interested can see that the funds are distributed fairly <number> bank accounts do not have any logic or programmability so even if unicef are completely honest it is still manual work for someone to check amounts coming in and set up the transfers to distribute the funds from the accounts in which the money was received to those to whom it is going this isnt efficient and introduces avenues for errors with gitcoin this can all happen automatically <number> lets say unicef did set up a good process for doing this with hundreds of bank accounts for hundreds of projects and a work flow to calculate the quadratic values and to move money around without errors the next ngo that wants to use quadratic funding then has to set that all up themselves as well you cant fork trained staff the more organizations using the system the more work overall with gitcoin all the code is open source the tooling and contracts can be shared as many times as there are organizations wanting to use it improvements can be spread easily and quickly amongst anyone using the system and so the more participants the better and more efficient it will get over time,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6Y29UaVdhVXNBWVZEam01bVd0ZE9DaUpWSzRnd0pEZ3RnOTVsS1NFVzJsTVdzemduMGZsZ0JBc2Y2TS1WRE1DR24yTHpwOXh1VDhrVHdzNElQazRjTFE9PQ==

again its not a technical issue but a political one property ownership is taxed if you dont pay your property taxes the government has mechanisms to confiscate your property they are able to do this because they control the official records of who owns the property if a decentralized ledger was used instead then government would lose their ability to confiscate your property which is their primary enforcement mechanism to collect property taxes government doesnt want this to happen so they dont adopt a decentralized ledger to record property ownership,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TnJxLWFOemlfc2tQTVRtTHd5RGRfY3JXSFhqYzNuMkpwS2lqbWd6Q0FCTGtrRjc3ZW81bzJSZUZucUw5RUxFMHdReDFIVGRVbW5DM3BtRE1ZSWVlNFFBa2hvWkNMVmk3ZWhjYUFiLXZCMG89

this kind of coordination is awkward in the end it is still politics the vision of two different way of managing a country has real world example hongkong in china from surface they have two different systems but when some of the conflict shows up eventually the law system of hongkong will be overtaken by chinese law enforcements in the end it is the law deciding what kind of behavior is allowed or not allowed and that can not be different when the two system is interconnected especially when it comes to some core values another example is the soviet union when the fundamental value start to differ between union members the whole ecosystem broke into small pieces i think the current lcentric design is actually weakening ethereums first mover advantage and network effect the project need powerful leadership to maintain its focus and that is difficult in lcentric design uvbuterin,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2T0I4YWItM3M3eEprZkozcmhlcFJjSTQtbkJIN3lMSnRMaF9LWTM5RlRjZ1Fvem9yTGVDbDBSV2tPUW9NQzZpRDduYzUzd20zOU9vMnExQmlRTnBOYnc9PQ==

im shit with words and youre an asshole when i mean light up i mean showed curiosity in a topic theyd not had the chance to study rather than teaching me or debating theyd shut up and try to learn with their full attention borrow my uni books for a few weeks then wed go pour over some of my homework problems together the fact is it took me multiple years to get to their same understanding on a new topic after some weeks if it was a topic they understood already id try to do the same back ultimately we challenged each other they were intellectual friends had i not fumbled my life up after that point theyd still be in my life today and i wouldnt be wasting my time here i met some shady drug vendors in that time too i happened to self select people for the best philosophical debates over best ways to press xanax considering youre stuck with them nearly an hour for each transaction they were smart enough to hold onto s of btc in the early days convinced itll be worth more than gold in the coming decades if they blundered and sold it all for pizza and never bought back in then theyd be idiots like me they should all be multi millionaires by now had they just not lost their keys seems all the smarts evacuated btc and migrated to ethereum et al since then so has my conviction oddly sans a few people working on zk proofs on bitcoin its a shadow of its former self unless you think everyone working in crypto is an idiot then idk what to tell you im red pilled on autistic math nerds and what shit they can come up with given a playground and incentives to work in the only good conversations i have lately are with the people working on starks i can code well enough to automate my jobs im not ignorant to how simple it can be i know coding doesnt make me some pariah and never once insinuated that either seems you had that comment locked and loaded before i even replied considering your first message and how the only mention of coding was mentioning <number> debate i had with an older guy over the philosophy of perl vs ruby that i didnt even divulge into the pp sites literally called them btc vendors get over yourself buddy crypto used to only be good to buy drugs with more or less most terminology mimicked that at the time you must think im room temperature idiot that i am utterly incapable of detecting if someone else is subjectively smart or a grifter nice conversation here precisely why i wouldnt do an inmeet pp transaction with the assholes involved with cryptocurrency today didnt mean to touch on a nerve there im sure you are just as smart too happy anyway yea cheers,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2REdSV3NEVVE5NWNMV1RmR2Y2d0plQmx0ZkdiYU5JVUpFZnI2ZlpzV3p6SW14X3pnLXN3elFyaHBGMExZN2RBc3BwcmVScVNITDU3ckQya29Bc3JQd1E9PQ==

the foundation doesnt pay core developers really the foundation has a bag of eth from the beginning theyve used to fund bug bounties and research grants for the most part and anyone is eligible for that even you no ones been paid a salary afaik due to the fact the bag from the beginning cannot be replenished more like oneshot deployment of funds where and when needed most similiar to the bitcoin foundation in that regard there is something called the protocol guild a fund put together a couple of years ago to ensure public good core developers have steady income and dont need to spend all their time working at wendys this was funded by volunteers and vcs more recently vaneck pledged <number> of their eth etf revenues to the team of core developers to also assist with funding public goods also on a volunteer basis those two funds have been the first time ive seen steady money going to the core developers the one is hardly a year old and the other hasnt launched yet the ef has had nothing to do with it gitcoin grants have been invaluable for funding research as well quadratic funding is how most gitcoin funding has been distributed its essentially public governance thats weighted in a half decent fair way there are some <number> different versions of ethereum running live now which all work on the same <number> protocol together all of the different execution and consensus clients are independent teams who are independently funded these are the people who make ethereum work and who implement the new research and probably the closest thing to salaried employees youd find though im not privvy into the specifics the foundations focus is in research and trying to herd all those independent cats in some way that makes sense for example vitalik will look at the development ongoing and piece it together into a visual roadmap but he does not dictate the roadmap or even the direction its going client diversity is an issue more novel and lightweight clients are the solution so the ef may spend some of their treasury funding researchers capable of creating viable alternatives due to open source this then benefits all people working on ethereum vitaliks retroactive public goods funding idea is imo the best way of distributing funds which was executed by optimism through the link below you can find some links explaining ways developers and researchers have been funded <url> separate from that there are some good links to follow on this page showing what the ef has funded themselves <url> >the ef is not a company or even a traditional nonprofit their role is not to control or lead ethereum nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of ethereumrelated technologies the ef is one part of a much larger ecosystem and if you want to see how exactly the sausage is made the ef streams core developer meetings on youtube each few days on the ethereum channel and all core developer meetings and meetups on the ethereumfoundation channel,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3dFVEcnpEVGdTSTQzRV9GTGh6YmF1cHhWNVVvNDcxRzRoZ29fN3ZsU0lTUHRBSWRnSUVSZEhFREFqX05PcWJpbzVGSVVDU0JkellESkpuSTE2bUxTUkE9PQ==

the answer to what how many exact employees they have and if they are on salaries directly paid by the foundation no i do not because its not actually easy to fond out that information its actually quite difficult the way these things work is usually non profit can have loads of other entities doing research or marketing for jobs or who knows what and the employees of each entity will not be included in headcount for foundation but they could still be considered employees when it comes to financial resources to pay them or it could be from donations from other unrelated institutions or a mixture of both just for one sub entity it is not such a straight forward question and answer and i dont get why that is controversial im interested in if the foundation or eth as a shorthand have statements and transparency regarding this and how they use the ico funds or donations im sure they do im just asking if anyone has that resource to help me find out,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3d0RVSlNXdmkwWGgzUUMyRnh6SjQyenhyaV85VGRlZk13ZlBVdEM4aUNtbjFYSjlvRWNCa25seE1tZnJlUEJINWRqRnUyRm1SRC0yNTFtbzlCNFBkYWc9PQ==

something to remember just like a bank your crypto is not actually in your wallet the ethereum network acts like a huge distributed database every time a new block is mined it is linked to previous blocks with information on how much of a certain token should be available for withdrawal from a certain address this is part of the calculation done in the ethereum virtual machine every time a transaction is processed it knows exactly how much of which token is currently active vs how much has been burned for that the calculation of gas fee takes the current amount of tokens volume of all transactions and availability of nodes to algorithmically shift the fee to facilitate times of high traffic vs low traffic and just like a bank you are incentivised to save when interest is high gas fees as these high fees are used to reward the savings accountsvalidators ethereum has no concept of abandoned wallets because wallets are just a human expression to help us understand and interface with the blockchain ether does not get lost it cant the ethereum blockchain knows where it is at all times and adjusts for it accordingly so crypto in your wallet is not like a traditional wallet its more like a spreadsheet edit being downvoted by people who dont understand how a blockchainlinked list works is absolutely wild,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WUpEcEtDdG1wWVhFSXJYMWFKNXlZTDkxS1JjUEFhQldDbHZDQzlwMHpqOVdDQU55Zlk1cU44enFIZ1N6N1ljTnc4WXlvdlVzWF9NQ0p4ck04Sm00NXc9PQ==

i think you understand this perfectly well and like your username indicates youre the voice of reason ethereum isnt tackling base layer money they dont care to and if they did they wouldnt have changed their monetary policy many times nor their mining protocol to staking staking has been around for shy of <number> years and i still see no meaningful improvements to tackling base layer many just more blcokchain versions of existing software sure you can call it decentralized but i dont really consider staking a consistently decentralized protocol the fact of the matter is ethereum had an ico that was not designed for fair distribution they have founders and leaders that have heavy influence and control over the protocol and those very same aspects allow pos to be manipulated which is the opposite of fair money the equation is pretty simple if i have more eth i can have more full vaildators i increase my chance of a full reward rinse and repeat you may not see this happening but a base layer money and store of value shouldnt have these properties but yeah you can send a lot of tps socool one is always useless without the other at least if your goal is to actually fix broken money which is a cause of so many issues in the world but if we are being honest ethereum never meant to do that they meant to create selfsovereignty and identity through all software rushed a solution by compromising core values and then hoodwinked everyone because they can do more maybe the problem with society is that we dont need more we need reliable and better,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MDh5VUFCVk9kSXVpTDlJYkwzX0p4cU9OMTQ5Y3lFcDJXU3pHVzZOaC1lOU4yVW9YUDNsMnNJQVZETFEtcmZ0a0tScmRvSS00OHNWVU5Td0dqRU5Yb3c9PQ==

i think typing all that type of stuff is why reddit is terrible for these discussions but i couldnt help it i just think bitcoin enjoyers see the world as fundamentally broken and ripe for fixing at the root level whereas ethereum folks just dont see that problem at all typically youre literally starting off with different truths so the discussion just isnt based in agreed reality i do see value in nft technology as well as many other aspects of ethereum but comparing the two is like comparing tcpip to aws sure they play in the same sandbox but one is entirely different and more valuable because of its strong base fundamentals,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4T0RCVTE4bmFZaUQxcDNndU1YQ1h2eTdQbzZ5eDJGNjNZMmhfZDFNVXNZQlc4VmF0REZxZ2VZZ0FtV3JEUHlZWXN2bWFYTWN6SV9lSlZXMUNQamFucHc9PQ==
eth has an issuance mechanism which is called eip it ensures a constant stream of revenue to validators to provide security this is on the form of issuance tip fees and other mev bitcoin also has issuance and tip fees however the issuance halves every <number> years which means profitability decreases it makes the money harder but the incentives to secure the network less what happens when issuance is so low its negligible the network must rely on only tips this requires a certain about of crossing fingers that there will be enough network activity to provide tip fees eip provides constant economic security its quite amazing further both ethereum and bitcoin can fork away bad actors the difference is you can slash the attackers stake in ethereum reducing their economic attack power or simply forbid them to join the network in btc because theres no stake you can fork away the bad actor but since they still have their hardware and electricity they can spawn camp the network and attack the new fork i believe also it requires over <number> of circulating supply of eth vs <number> btc for majority attacks another consideration is that the bitcoin protocol has one software service to run what is theres a bug in the code in the language a team member goes rogue ethereum had multiple clients written in multiple languages by teams so yeah i am serious ethereum is more secure,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4d0JiazNja0FXQklXR0dhZjBUVm12UG9RX1J3VkxGOFlYZXVXaDFzYmV3Qjh3elFlbmRSOG12WFhldW1xWGgzNlV0ZmxsZGU0NTgzLVBaT2FOQTVxaFE9PQ==

utxo is bad for l scaling with a global state + fraud proofs each l inherits the ls full security assumptions and validator set with utxo each l is an independent network akin to a sidechain or competing fork with its own security assumptions these competing sidechains open themselves up nasty game theories the usual way out is through an additional subset of permissioned reputation based monitoring nodes who watch over the entire network increasing complexity cost and reducing security a utxo cannot be compressed a tenth as much as an entire block or zk proof can be the dust from small transactions accumulating dramatically increases the storage requirements held by l nodes over time likely to the point of requiring additional offchain data availability nodes increasing complexity cost and reducing security this leads itself to funky things like data unavailability in the case of mass exits which either deletes user funds or enables invalid transactions to take place the solution to this is the da nodes also must be permissioned andor reputation based else lock up massive amounts of collateral otherwise being used to secure the l a mass l exit would lead to extreme l congestion which would hault a fixedfee utxo chain like cardano essentially with an accounts based model additional ls dont harm the ls decentralization and with the utxo model ls necessarily increase complexitycentralization while competing with the ls own security budget a good way to look into this argument is by looking into plasma chains ethereum already tried this model once before and was even going to shard which is whats necessary to implement this on utxo there is a ton of thorough research why plasma didntcant work meaning it is too limited and subpar to use in practice leading to why plasma and sharding was scrapped for accounts based rollups instead,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDeXRLNG9hVGlTdS1rM3NIa2NwQXotMUtONkRKNDVmdUJuYmhHLUpzMURXMVFBNFg2eGJJQllTVFQtb2RJNVRFU2xNbnJrNUF1dk5QTzJXY0UxWDdGRXc9PQ==

its a common trope with btc maxis that ~n btc have been lost already and therefore price discovery is more likely to occur sooner than common sense would imply eg the first million coins or however assuming satoshi remains lost i think this is where op got their idea from there is m total btc but if m are lost theres only m making any one a lot more scarce its a perverse idea but not an uncommon one lost ether has relatively <number> impact on the running of the network assuming a validator doesnt lose their private keys but a non<number> impact to ethers price sensitivity which i think was clear is what op was alluding at i dont agree with you that the principals of supply and demand dont apply to cryptocurrencies especially pos cryptocurrencies they are finate assets like any other roughly if <number><number> the total amount of ether is lost inaccessible for any reason the price will be x as sensitive to fluctuations granted the supply of fiat plays a much larger role in price discovery here but the amount of coin circulating or available to purchase is always on the other side of that equation this sub is hugely ignorant to how cryptocurrencies work it can be frustrating at times gatekeeping isnt helpful either though the idea other opinions dont matter when seemingly youve missed the point of ops post yourself as evidenced by your replies and downvotes at least a few of those others understood the question wasnt related to network bloat or security in nature,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDMVk4TUdHNXNOeTBuaFNua0JTWFRadHptMXB4ZnN2NTFoTjQ4ekxWSDJYblRuaXF5LVN0TnUyYWcyaHpSSG1PQWJ4eHBRcGpHQWR6clppc1lESHNuQ1E9PQ==

plasma is lightning essentially my same post and links all apply lightning is better at scaling utxo than account based global state systems mostly due to the reduced transaction complexity possible in utxo and inherit nature of smart contracts in ab so there are fewer tradeoffs that need to be made i wouldnt say lightning is superior to onchain rollups though especially whenever data availability value is much of a concern onchain ls arent really viable on a decentralized utxo chain so its not really apples to apples lightning is the best utxo can achieve without scaling the l to the same level as the l which would defeat the purpose if utxo could handle an onchain l some way those rollupsls would be superior to lighting on utxo and maybe on par with rollups on ab global state systems you can still have your coins effectively deleted using the lightning network on btc ln requires persistent watchtower nodes to reduce the risk which severely reduces the security guarentees held by the l while it naturally trends towards centralization due to the tradeoffs involved in bridging inout or its state channelsrouting it doesnt actually solve scaling because you cant purchase lightning btc in any decentralized or permissionless manner in the way you can purchase eth already on some l all of lightnings issues have be resolved with onchain rollupsls which imo makes them far superior though its still an apples to oranges scenereo given its comparing state vs nostate just meaning its easierbetter to work with your already decentralized state with the option to remove the state plasma vs trying to layer in a state into a nostate decentralized l while maintaining decentralization,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDSWt1U19jTnppSkxGVWYya09jd2NmS19PY1JJUk43M2lIVjFKeGNfanFXM2xFb05aZC1qMDNrV1B4UzVHSVlHWTZlemN0N2g1Y1lsaWdvSHNzUDJMaGc9PQ==
you cant ask questions about a distributed network and be unhappy that you got a technical answer though as far as i am aware ethereum is a decentralised blockchain network you ask technical questions a software developer is going to give you a technical answer i am not gatekeeping hence why i was giving a lot of context and comparisons to traditional banking in my original answer i want more people to get into cryptocurrencies but theres a level of understanding that you need to have if you are going to ask technical questions if i was to ask how gilts worked and received an indepth answer surrounding the concept of the bonds market i cant be annoyed that someone gave as much context to help me understand that my concern doesnt really exist,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDd1FTLVdZS3RKeTBGMlFXR0l2bHkwWE1PZnpOMUI2YzA5ZjgzSVQzNWJrdTY4M2tYZ2t0VUp5UDVVc181MDdzaU16V0wxVUNHQlZuVVVYWHBKbnpSTXc9PQ==
