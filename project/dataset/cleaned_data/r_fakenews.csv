the piece is about fox news willful ignorance of the history of racism interwoven with the history of america the american confederate and confederate battle flags are all filtered over each each other to suggest that racism never died in american attention has just been directed elsewhere i started out wanting to make the notion of american prosperity or manifest destiny into a snakes and ladders boardgame that is rather a front to a manipulative confusing and cruel system one ladder is conspicuously placed and the snakes are slithering amok i wanted the iconography to be characters that could lend themselves to the scenes but be free of the baggage of the subject matter in satirizing fox news propaganda i wanted to allude to the history of racism without delivering the pill with too many sharp edges or to nerf or disneyfy the history disney characters from my childhood felt appropriately ironic to incorporate since the company has been at ideological war with conservatives in recent years the foxes are from disneys the fox and the hound which i would argue was promoting the appreciation of differences and loving the other as its moral the paintings foxes are quite the contrary sporting tucker carlsons famous bow tie and pitifully outraged expressions the king and his sycophant sir hiss from robin hood are camped out on native american land and mesmerized by vanity much like at mara lago situated on seminole land chief wahoo is a similarly awful and degrading of an image as that of sambo and yet it is still used as a corporate logo because the native american genocide has become a side note in history it seemed fitting to have the image be the only reference to this part of the story the larger story is slavery in america becoming mutated instead of extinguished by the th amendment to the us constitution slavery was still legal for convicts so america just had to learn how to incarcerate better to preserve white power paul bunyan is seen in the right side of the painting displaying his white privilege as he gestures towards opportunity and prosperity out of frame his counterpart babe the blue ox is left to toil in prison garb wearing the <number> on is back and receiving backlash from the foxes for his angst from his fate hes pulling an empty santa sleigh with the pointlessness of sisyphus whilst pulling along an exploitative system that only helps the rich private prison shareholders get even richer paul and babe in the disney tall tale version create the rocky mountains in their mighty tussle upon meeting and change the landscape with logging like no other in their eventual alliance this felt like a heavily euphemized way to view the formation of americas great wealth and prosperity being created on the backs of slaves their alliance made them an incomparable resource for american expansionism until the rich industrialist came to town with his machines like a chainsaw and locomotive to put paul and babe out of business the mustachioed industrialist appears in the center of the painting swallowing the scene that he is woven around with one eye on the king and the other eye on babe the industrialist represents a media billionaire that can be someone like rupert murdoch or elon musk just a rich person using technology to subjugate the source image of the scene that the industrialist is swallowing was a protester and his super hero costumed daughter facing riot police this image particularly disturbed me as i refuse to believe there can be any justification for aiming a smoke grenade launcher at a toddler the scene is broken up by the flags bars into guide lines that separate the abstracted grey area or the realistic rendered portions of the figures the humanities of the officers and the father dont match up as he goes in and out of reality or presence whilst supporting his daughter who is simultaneously riding his shoulders and the industrialists nose she could be victim to circumstances that have trickled down from ultimately a few hands for very selfish and licentious reasons between the super hero infant and the narcissistic trespass of the king on tribal land is of course the insurrection of january th this was enabled by white power and privilege fueled by propaganda and white rage over the paranoias of their replacement and absolutely stoked by the disinformation from fox news and their ilk the kings sycophant slithers toward the viewer to hypnotize and coax you toward the goal of upending democracy in favor of the fascist narrative are the chief wahoos threatening the king or is the ouroboros threatening them this snake also completes a q with the ouroboros snake to denote qanons role in the disinformation and manipulation of information for nefarious purposes this q also sits in the painting like how some storybooks start out chapters with a giant and ornate first letter of the first word insinuating that qanon might harken in a dark new chapter in american racism inside the ouroboros posturing as the king is the guy that broke into nancy pelosis office to put his feet on her desk and rummage through her belongings this felt like one of the most entitled images i had ever seen and demonstrated the ownership the insurrectionists were taking in their crimes the other police officers are depicted in the painting not to address the insurrection but to bombard the convict at the slightest sign of aggression the industrialists mustache seems to mediate or instigate these forces of the police and those that are being particularly policed whilst meanwhile covering the opportunities of the ladder,r/fakenews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSZDVtcHRmMHBxSGFVZldJa3BweDFtcml5UUZCbjZGc0FGcTl2OTVJem5kcjNlNnVnYWJRY1Nlc2pXNlZsQ2pxM0c0WVZ2RnkxTFlwVkd0U09RR2dsUEE9PQ==

the problem with this line of reasoning is the unstated premise that the police killed him floyd had meth and fentanyl in his system consistent with overdose had been drifting in and out of consciousness before confronted by police an ambulance was called when he told officers he couldnt breathe and this was well before he was restrained on the ground he also swallowed more pills as police attempted to arrest him the paramedics couldnt treat him because of the unruly crowd oh and floyd had extremely high blood pressure cardiomyopathy and advanced blockages in his blood vessels kanye west became the new face of white supremacy odor saying that chauvins knee wasnt on floyds neck like that but its plain as day this isnt a situation where one can truly say what caused his heart to stop but not only is there reasonable doubt but its honestly much more likely that he died from drugs + stress,r/fakenews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSc0tEOWJmYWFmNDlRTENzY19Hb04xVHFtREFNNjRpY0tsQ2N5Q05JdkhSQkdZR01zeFlMN3o1S29DMk80THpKOW01TlpBY1RMd29iblBrM0FnQU1RVmYtRzU1cGZUUmJ2MzVWRDdWd3ljd2c9
