i was already on board with filecoin well before reading your breakdown after reading your comment i might move a fairly sizeable postion into file coin ,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMGJiNF80aDQtZ0dTZEdnbWVhbi1KMFhQc0FJOUpiWlJ2QWNCUXQ3RGdMLTEza3FJT1FCTXRkeDRJWE0zQnVFRWtDbEdVZDdIWWtfOW1SSkE3cVRFN2c9PQ==
i have no idea at this point this coin did hover around <cur><number><number> before exploding to <cur><number> and literally no one thought that was possible at that time i would say however that at this point with btcs price and the history of fil you would expect us to be at <cur><number><number> at this point and we are sitting around <cur><number><number> the amount of inflation the coin has undergone is extreme but it was also inflating at an extreme rate when it blew up before its also why people thought it wouldnt rise before idk its also hard to know the exact market cap because i read conflicting info on how its accurately depicted coin market cap doesnt account for burn rate which is built into filecoin and my previous research indicated anywhere from million million have been burned its hard to find <number> accurate info on this so its not x inflated its <number>x inflated depending the real question to ask is if its insane and unheard of for a coin to do <number>x its previous marketcap because thats what we would need to do hit the previous all time high again or come close to it id say its very normal for coins to do <number>x what they did before but who knows dogecoin and shiba and pepe would have made anyone rich and they have <number> usecase outside of being memes no logic or rational seems to matter at all just hype and despair,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUWRoMkxiMzNyT1J1NUMzel9sMnlnTG9sZHVGRVFyTGxISnhfaVpTb0NQMWhDTWdrSFZYOFltUzZTR1laeUtEcUszdl9telFLWjEweGs5TTFQdDRLOWc9PQ==

im sorry i cant answer that question unless you mean why should filecoin devs care in which case as i have already said this has a very negative impact on the filecoin project staking in eth is designed by the eth dev team such that you cant be robbed filecoin staking and stfil give the impression that the situation is similar in reality clearly not as a newcomer to filecoin i saw the staking service mentioned in many places and assumed it was legitimate i should have done more due diligence but anything the filecoin devs core team can do to try and get this resolved would be good for me and others you think it has not impacted opinion of the project look at the token price,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYjhaM2M4VXJjX0ZYUHNmWE5CUHNBZnZkcjFvUlZpOWZTWDhIOXBta2l3MHlaWUYwSllLRWJUOFJZMFB2ZTlxcTFMNDN5R1FadnRBVmJ4ejNIWkYxZ2c9PQ==

there will never be an official filecoin staking option because filecoin is not proof of stake however <cur>fil collateral is required by the storage providers miners to operate on the network and earn <cur>fil projects like stfil pay yield to people who stake their <cur>fil which is then used for collateral and enables additional <cur>fil to be mined of course anytime you give your <cur>fil to someone else there is a risk involved,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdFVKRVBTQ19jeFNMclloeTg3bG5iRUkwMTdmdXhjNl9LSXVKREJlajhoVWx2bUltSUc5OElrV0N1NExMMmw1YVQxUkp1dE03Y2hMeUZJbnltMUVWVWc9PQ==

great question all i can say my friend is that a lot of coins that went <number>x and the whole market was insane interest rates were way lower inflation wasnt a huge concern untaround <number> when the ukraine and russia war started and since then we started to sea lot of complications and rising prices of goods services commodities you name it especially gas prices everything is more expensive with interest rates being so high we likely wont see much speculation aka large sums of cash into more speculative assets like crypto in general despite me thinking its not nearly as risky as the bullshit us dollar many coins have barely if at all recovered since then but if we find ourselves in a crazy crypto mania i think we may be able to see those highs again all this to say that i think fil reached its highs alongside many other coins due to the lower interest rate environment we were in and more people had money to spare back then now days shoot car payments are double what they used to be mortgage rates and housing prices and rent prices are higher car insurance is higher so we are all tighter on money and institutions arent taking big loans out with these higher interest rates to speculate on crypto,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtSWlfSU1tejFtTjE4ZHV4VHFPaVpRZF95VFlHWlVVNTRzVld3TDJvSUdvY1lsUnN6dXdYakx6SjBXNUNkRXBvZHJvYmQtMVJWb2RHdG1zdFV0SHdRdGRmZ2tzSkxIM3k0SHZSUG1hcjVNeUU9

i think for one it was only <number> million coins at the time and now its <number> million because the system is based on extreme inflation for some reason on the other hand the inflation was there even before but it was just a lower amount of coins it was fairly new it popped off and it inspired a lot of money you can see this even with meme coins today if literally anything starts moving people adopt it in mass to catch the train we would need an extreme situation like that to push it you just never know i wouldnt be shocked to see it go to <cur><number> im just not expecting that at all id hope for <cur><number><number> i remember when xrp was worth a th of <number> cent people talked about <cur><number> everyone called them insane mentioned how impossible it would be etc then xrp went to <cur><number> triple the impossible number all you can do is hold if you are already in jumping coins rarely pays off if its a flop remember it and dont make the same mistake again,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtakNvV0pYU0gzeHRuNlgxei1XaGh1N1ROT3RfT3QxWnFoOXhPZ3ZxeFZGQUtZNmlBeWxCUnppYXFPTG1uS1laQmcwaTVtU3lGS0tWU2tzMkpBcFNGU0E9PQ==

filecoin has very strong fundamentals although it will take time till depin tech is ready proving that you stored some file or have some storage available takes a lot of compute which leads to a very high initial hardware investment cryptographic proofs are not for free but when the decentralized storage industry takes off this will incentives to build appropriate hardware similar to bitcoin asics but economically more sustainable this makes l buying this kind of hardware a long term investment which makes it super cheap a miner could lower his investment by x or more while revenue stays the same more miners buying hardware makes the hardware even cheaper and better at the same time filecoin will become less computationally demanding while filecoin miners have to stake fil the price will rise proportionally to the demand of decentralized storage or storage in general if fil will ever surpass its past ath i can not tell more than x are certainly possible but it will take time there is also nvidia or gamestop for the ones which are not very patient,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtLUVkN0hRRWRBcjNHWk9DOEl2WG9CbWREYlN5a2ZRaFJrNXBaRHBubE1PbWM5bG9FTGF4Nk92NW5IUDhQR2N4bTdSY1RfMUx4ZFRtS2sxZnp3cE9pMnc9PQ==

price is very important as this is the leading factor into businesses establishing infrastructure to support the network my inclination is that the bull run really hasnt started and wont really kick off until late august if you look at btc correlation it hasnt really broken the <cur>k threshold in any significant manner the fundamentals of btc price revolve around hardware dumping and acquisition by small and large btc farms respectively price is suppressed when the large firms liquidate large holdings for cash on hand to purchase the hardware of small firms that are liquidating due to the halving events effect on their revenue after hardware acquisition takes hold and the hardware is delivered and turned on a period of holding resumes for the large farms to reconsolidate their holdings for an anticipated ath dump and maximum profits filecoins price will have some correlation with this timeline and the whole process really takes about <number> months,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4Z29JY0NHVDhyU3A2cXBVcnVGYXF5bUNIOEthRkxoV2p1OGRjdjd1T1VuQ2RfM0hKX3d3MkRRRi1HUndtSVBteV9ubmJ2MHFpMzJKd0VvSXhBekREZlJCRl9PaTI2SktFeVJITGI1MEFHZW89

the tokenomics are actually just complicated for the majority of people to understand fil is inherently deflationary because of its capped supply and burn protocols new emissions have plummeted from launch and will only continue to plummet as more data comes online and simply with time couple that with all of the locked or collateralized fil to even store data and you realize a significant portion of the network isnt and wont be liquid in any future however the rhetoric at large out there right now is exactly the opposite and its killing retail investment at the moment i wouldnt expect <number> of people to even be able to digest specfilecoinio though and furthermore protocol labs doesnt seem to care about retail at the moment which is fine these things all lead to fil being a longer term play and like you said a good buy,r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEcUhjQjY1Um0zdUZBY3VUVDVTWG0zVFd6TjJ3YW1SRVJoYlZGdUxCYnAxaFUwczdsOHZkenUxT1BTRF9yU0dIQ2tNazlvQzlUdW5pbFYzeXg5LW9WOGc9PQ==
