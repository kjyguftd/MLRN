i see what youre getting at im not sure how if at all the major indexes adjust for this on one hand yes summing the total market caps of both does suggest an overlap on the other what can be done about it without being inaccurate do you reduce brk do you reduce aapl some other adjustment in all cases youd be forced to say that something isnt worth what it actually plainly is i am aware theres an adjustment for market float and that may be in play here to some degree but im not sure what that degree would be in this specific case as afterall brk can still ultimately trade aapl away if they did brk would still have the same value just trading aapl shares for cash and aapl would also be unaffected nothing has changed about the company in reality there would be execution costs and movement as a result of this but just to simplify well ignore them for now,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRDVFcUctWVhkZVRlOFVSTDdHMWNJenhUWXMzSUxaSTVPa0tlOXZpQm5PZUdtLUJmekd6aHFBMmtQckZ2Z3lkbmpERmtjRkNqS1psV09HSDlfSzZ5X0E9PQ==

it is one of the best finance books ever written however its sequel is even more impactful cash flow quadrant if you can only read one book on finance cash flow quadrant is it and dont believe the haters on rich dad poor dad it teaches you that investing and running a business is the only path to wealth we are often taught that getting a good job will set us up for life but no one becomes wealthy from employment income if you have a good job you still need to invest significant savings to build wealth this seems intuitive to some but its surprising how few people in reality realize that they are in control of their own financial future its also easier than its ever been to invest with extremely low cost index funds and etfs as well as generous govt programs in many countries,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVXVlRXpOQktZMnVJQ2d4cmM4U1JTQjJmb0JnZmJQUFRZU204NjNSZml5OWRhd1QtWTRsdl9WWjAycE9hNGdmaFppVmNPSTk0Z2ZvcFdUOTVmUkVoa2c9PQ==
this book others have noted is maybe good for people who have zero understanding of money and thinking about the future it is survivorship bias and also not really relevant to today where debt is no longer cheap and much of what helps you be successful today is not as cheap as it used to be education real estate if anything id say it promotes a gogetter mentality for people who have been passivenonexistent in their thinking about finances otherwise bogleheads or mr money mustache are better sources for advice,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVkV0Y2xDYW9uTWdGYUlCcG5Nc0pBMlZPN3ZLYVlaUzZuY3IxYmNHUGgxTEwtS29pNzhRZm5hV2lfaERYd2RpMWx4amdIb3g5dzBxV3d4TFFyNTBicFE9PQ==

the bes damn sales book ever is a pretty fun humorous read the audiobook is narrated by the author warren greshes and hes basically a comedian and a salesman put together its pretty basic and cliche shit but if youre new to sales its pretty solid and not too greasy from my memory flip the script by oren klaff was one i originally really liked but now that ive been selling for over a decade i realize alot of that book is top sensationalized and overcomplicstes the process to be honest i havent read a sales book in years most are garbage and just super greasy and i hate that shit its rookie and doesnt work better than any book ive ever read is one simple quote from a youtuber that i forgot the name of swn as in sw cubed like exponents some will some wont so what next thats the only attitude for success in sales in my opinion,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRkExUkxNMUNnanNIbWVjT3lQNC1tbWdyZk1EWk9qZGFiR2E2bkFwWW9sNHZHSE03NWZLVE5BME90Q0gxcy1xTTR5S2hZZkVjT0REbkhiTVVEWkR0R3c9PQ==

yup exactly which is very basic advice that to be fair some people do need to learn these guys all have some magic ability to speak to certain people so it really helps them to hear kiyosaki tell them to do the most basic shit that they probably already know after that he starts giving investing tips that are horrendous and has probably reruined many a person he has saved but if those people can stop once the basic stuff clicks they can hopefully move on to something credible,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdWY2NUh2S3lPUktXbEFqUDR0Y2l6RmI0aU9kYmdlaU84NzFLSHJJb1RvME13dldFcm03Q1ZVbS04WUxPb29hMFhHQ1BpcEVzbmN3bkNNZHVXYjJqWEE9PQ==

heres a an interesting white paper from moody that compares proposed policies of both presidents on inflation interest rates gdp <url> obviously take it with a grain of salt my econ understanding isnt super advanced just graduated undergrad from ivy with a degree in econ but conceptually his immigration policy tracks with higher i rates restricting border deporting illegal immigrants lead to a lower unemployment rate reducing employee pool which would cause an increased inflation rate which would lead to higher interest rates feds dual mandate philips curve should also be stated and i dont fully understand but the standard inverse relationship between home price mortgage rates function of hp interest rates has broken down generally the sharp climb in rates from the s a couple years ago to s now should have caused prices to decline obviously that hasnt been the case this phenomenon can be partially explained by the velocity of market transactions wherein the rapid rise of i rates has effectively locked people into their homes this has led to drastically reduced supply driving sales prices up for listed homes this all begs the question what is the best mortgage rate for hpa,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT0dOdktOeEFIcDh5TXBkY08xcEZ4elBIR0M3dFoxenN4Wngxb0ZzSjRBZ3pWNnRKZURBY053WjhHU20xR1ZHMVBVNDJiZ0NRaTRHSEFDTThOLVJOQzBfU3djYjlJcVlqdVdHdmFDXzBnbmc9

the president appoints members of the fed board of governors as well as the chairman who set interest rates low interest rates result in money being loaned for mortgages for less more people qualify for higher amounts of loans because not as much of the monthly payment goes to interest and demand for housing goes up when demand for housing goes up the price gets more expensive its weird that you think politics doesnt have anything to do with monetary policy and the economy,r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcmluX2pwUW1xS2xnUEhLNTF1YnJ0UjF6Nlg5dDZOQ3N4aTBfZlBVTURLWUxaNklya1ZtazJjY0c2V0k3aEtWejA3RVJYY0s4RUZrbnVsc1hHdFQ0bEhwaFdRX19sZHdKcU94bEg4Z3oxV2M9
