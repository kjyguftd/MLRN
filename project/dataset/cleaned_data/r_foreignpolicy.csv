embargoes are minimal contrary to some opinions israelis are not settler colonialists jews believe they are originally from the land of israel because they are and zionism far from being a colonialist project is the oldest anticolonialist struggle in history starting during the roman era if not the babylonian captivity before it > > as for the idea that israeli jews should return like the algerian french piedsnoirs to the lands of their forebears where and what is that the lands of russian pogroms or arab massacres or the holocaust israels harshest critics tend to miss the point but israelis dont they have nowhere else to go a fact underscored by the waves of hatred now engulfing jewish diasporic communities the more pressure is exerted on israel to relent in the face of its enemies the more zionism it will generate nothing so crystallizes jewish identity as these daily reminders of bigotry > > for iran the principal threat to the regime comes from within and below it is easy to forget that before the <number> mass protests over head scarves and womens rights more broadly there were the <number> mass protests over the price of fuel and the <number> protests over economic conditions or that <number> years earlier there was the <number> green revolution over the stolen election or the iranian student protests of <number> > > though the regime has proved adept at suppressing dissent through ultraviolent means my colleague nick kristof has written powerfully about the use of mass rape as a means of suppressing opposition something that somehow failed to generate much outrage at places like columbia or berkeley the increasing frequency and durability of these protests should tell us something > > two things in fact the stock of public anger at the regime keeps rising as the bases of its support keep dwindling with the death of raisi that dwindling base may at the same time be dividing an informal law of economics named for herbert stein holds that trends that cant continue wont it should be a law for political survival too > > like iran israel still has profound domestic vulnerabilities only some of which came to the fore in the months of protest over judicial changes that preceded oct <number> thats to say nothing about rightwing extremism the resistance of the ultraorthodox to fulfill their civic obligations or the ultimate question of an eventual palestinian state but none of those need put the deepest convictions of zionism at stake that jews have the right to rule themselves as a sovereign state in their original homeland > > for irans rulers the risks are graver theyve always claimed to be the vanguard of an islamic revolution but they seem to have forgotten that revolutions have a history of consuming their own irans people by and large dont want to be islamists but israel wants and will fight to remain

john ghazvinian is executive director of the middle east center at the university of pennsylvania > the uncertainty ushered in by the death of irans president ebrahim raisi in a helicopter crash just weeks after an unprecedented exchange of military attacks with israel has brought a chilling question to mind is <number> the year that iran finally decides it can no longer take chances with its security and races to build a nuclear bomb > > up to now for reasons experts often debate iran has never made the decision to build a nuclear weapon despite having at least most of the resources and capabilities it needs to do so as far as we know but mr raisis death has created an opportunity for the hardliners in the country who are far less allergic to the idea of going nuclear than the regime has been for decades > > even before mr raisis death there were indications that irans position might be starting to shift the recent exchange of hostilities with israel a country with an undeclared but widely acknowledged nuclear arsenal has provoked a change of tone in tehran we have no decision to build a nuclear bomb but should irans existence be threatened there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine kamal kharrazi a leading adviser to irans supreme leader said on may <number> > > in april a senior iranian lawmaker and former military commander had warned that iran could enrich uranium to the <number> percent purity threshold required for a bomb in half a day or lets say one week he quoted the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei saying that the regime will respond to threats at the same level implying that israeli attacks on irans nuclear facilities would cause a rethinking of irans nuclear posture > > irans relationship with nuclear technology has always been ambiguous even ambivalent both during the regime of the prowestern shah mohammed reza pahlavi in the s and s and the antiamerican islamic republic that has held power since <number> iran has kept outside powers guessing and worrying about its nuclear intentions but it has never made the decision to fully cross the threshold of weaponization there are several important reasons for this ranging from religious reservations about the morality of nuclear weapons to irans membership in the global treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons npt but the biggest reason has been strategic > > historically irans leaders have repeatedly concluded that they have more to gain from playing by the rules of the international nonproliferation order than they do from racing for the bomb to do so they would have to first withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty which would immediately signal their intentions to the world and could invite american military intervention at the same time the revolutionary government has been reluctant to cave into western demands and dismantle their program altogether as that would demonstrate a different kind of weakness irans leaders are no doubt keenly aware of the example of libyas muammar elqaddafi who agreed in <number> to abandon his countrys nuclear program only to find himself overthrown eight years later following military intervention by a natoled coalition > > that strategic happy medium has worked well for the islamic republic until now two decades of dysfunctional us nuclear policy toward iran have created a dangerous dynamic in which iran enriches more uranium than it otherwise might either as a defensive posture or a negotiating tactic and gradually inches its way toward being able to make a weapon that it might not even really want > > when the usiran nuclear dispute first emerged in the early s iran had only <number> antiquated centrifuges and little real appetite for a weapons program but the bush administrations unrealistic insistence that iran agree to zero enrichment turned it into a matter of national pride during the years that the obama administration spent negotiating with iran the regime kept enriching uranium and adding to its stockpile in part as a hedge against future concessions and of course president donald trumps withdrawal from the nuclear deal in <number> and subsequent campaign of maximum pressure only added to irans defiance > > today iran has thousands of advanced centrifuges and a large stockpile of enriched uranium this in turn has provoked some camps inside iran to adopt a might as well argument for nuclear weaponization if weve already come this far the argument goes then why not just go for a bomb > > under ayatollah khamenei iran has remained adamant that it is better off demonstrating to the world its willingness to stay within the nonproliferation treaty but in recent years as western sanctions have piled up and irans economy has been strangled hardliners have occasionally suggested that the country has gained nothing from this posture and might be better off following the north korea model that is pulling out of the nonproliferation treaty and racing for a bomb as north korea did in <number> until now these voices have been quickly marginalized as its clear the supreme leader does not share the sentiment an early s fatwa or religious ruling by ayatollah khamenei declared nuclear weapons to be forbidden under islam and decreed that the islamic republic of iran shall never acquire these weapons > > mr raisis death has quickly and dramatically shifted the landscape a regime that had already begun to drift into militarism and domination by the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc now risks moving more firmly into this camp some in the irgc see the fatwa as outdated one senior former regime official recently told me that the top brass of the corps is itching to engineer the fatwas reversal and will most likely do so at the first opportunity > > regardless of who wins the snap presidential election that now must be held by early july the ultimate succession battle will be for the role of supreme leader and the irgc is likely to play a decisive role in the transition the late president was seen as a frontrunner to succeed the <number>yearold ayatollah now other than ayatollah khameneis son there are few strong contenders whoever prevails is likely to rely heavily on the irgc for his legitimacy > > historically iran has felt a nuclear hedging strategy is its best defense against external aggression and invasion and tehran may continue to calculate that racing for a bomb would only invite more hostility including from the united states then again an increasingly distracted and unpredictable washington might not be in a position to react forcefully against a sudden and rapid iranian rush for a bomb especially if iran chooses its moment wisely > > between the war in gaza a possible change in american leadership and a domestic power vacuum that the irgc could step into it is not difficult to imagine a brief window in which iran could pull out the stops and surprise the world by testing a nuclear device > > would i bet the house on this scenario perhaps not but from the perspective of a historian the possibility of an iranian rush for a bomb has never felt more real than it does today,r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWWliSTREQkhaYjJZa2FIZ1lvdjl5S1VHTVZWaThwRW4wYWQ4NmJQUzJWNXM3NXZyLWtUd3IwbVhWQXhJalM3cnlFTXNOdTF4NE83TEQ5TWRvYXdORnc9PQ==
note you can scroll down a bit for an audio version of this article this report is extremely revealing about how israel has gone about displacing and harming palestinians in the west bank by supporting abetting and providing cover for settler violence israels ethnic cleansing and illegal settlement expansion in the west bank are perhaps the biggest flashpoint in the israelipalestinian conflict so many destructive decisions and beliefs can be tied to it for example israeli leaderships shunning of a peace deal and twostate solution since the status quo leaves it in power and free to expand settlements settlements are so important because they will be extremely hard to uproot in any potential peace deal meaning israel is tightening its grip on this illegally settled land this section really stood out to me >sharon announced what he called israels disengagement from gaza with a plan to remove settlers forcibly if necessary over the next two years the motivations were complex and the subject of considerable debate for sharon at least it appeared to be a tactical move the significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process his senior adviser dov weisglass told haaretz at the time and when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of a palestinian state this shows that even with supposedly peaceseeking actions like removing settlers from gaza israeli leadership sought to cripple the twostate solution israels continued violence and humiliating occupation and subjugation of palestinians as detailed ad nauseum in this report has been the fuel that lifted up groups like hamas and pushed palestinians to seek violent means of resistance in their view israel hasnt been a willing and open partner for peace i strongly recommend that you read this extremely wellreported article,r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjYy1HS3NNaktkMWFwNDgyOXZyRjI4LU1fc1hZTlpZMmpJYUh3UWg2RDJ1dndabHZTRVFSdmJhdTl2aDFBRUd4YUFQX3pJSmhoSk9DNGV2MmhyR3ZPaGc9PQ==

well the united states biggest win is probably the incorporation of the european nations that were under the influence of russia into nato and the european union us foreign policy has also successfully recognised china as a threat in <number> and is now seeking to contain its increasing presence in the south china sea as a result aukus was established in <number> and japan is increasing its military might and cooperating extensively with the us against china the reason these are victories for the us foreign policy establishment in my opinion are as follows firstly the us has managed to keep the nato alliance very much alive through incorporating most of the exsoviet republics and other nations which is now keeping majority of the european continent in tune with one another therefore allowing a certain stability to reign over the continent which has not been seen before in europes dark history it is also worth noting that all the countries in nato value each others sovereignty and support democratic values which is an important matter for society in my opinion i firmly believe that if there was no nato or eu every european nation would go back to days of th century diplomacy where balance of power was a key theme and every nation would look to increase its power the us could have easily dismantled nato after the collapse of the soviet union as many people argued such as george kennan himself nevertheless nato has survived and europe is united as never before while i am aware that the eu is not a project of the us it is nonetheless greatly supportive of the union and definitely influences its politics in many ways secondly when it comes to the south china sea i guarantee you that if it was not for the us backing of taiwan a war would have erupted in the south china sea a long time ago countless lives would have perished and who knows what that region would look like however thanks to the united states increasing military presence in the region a war in the south china sea is not viable as china will not risk going to war with the us the us is deterring china from acquiring <number> of the south china sea and is therefore upholding international law to which china is also ascribed too furthermore the aukus alliance has given hope to the countries of the indopacific that their sovereignty will be respected and not violated by chinas ambitions this is my humble opinion i am aware that is a far from perfect opinion but i would love to hear feedback on my comment so if anyone agrees or disagrees do feel free to share,r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQnZmQTlwOTBZMGt4X2Fla045MEZnMXNoa2dNS2xUOHQ5OGZBLWE3RTRwZVRqQmUycllYUEE2SDgxNjNBRlZwYXd1ZFh4NkJJQ29XcG1Zb2d2MG9sb3c9PQ==

atrophied and underutilized now three and a half years later our allies are committing more to our common defense than at any point since the end of the cold war making both them and america more

annexation of crimea to spend <number> percent of their gross domestic product on defense twentythree nato members out of <number> are expected to meet or exceed that target in <number> compared with just nine in <number> and five in <number> this year alone americas nato partners canada and <number> european nations will spend an estimated <cur><number> billion on defense that is an increase of <cur><number> billion from <number> compared with an increase of <cur><number> billion from <number> to <number> during the previous administration > > these numbers will continue to improve in

battle tanks <number> combat vehicles and nearly <number> artillery systems to modernize their arsenals making us all more secure so indeed europe is doing more > > there are a number of reasons for this important shift the president knew that we could persuade our allies and partners to do more and spend more if we strengthened and deepened ties instead of bullying them or threatening to leave the alliance europe as well was adjusting to the new security realities following russias invasion of ukraine in <number> > > the good news is not confined to nato in the indopacific our closest partners are also increasing their military spending japan committed to doubling its national securityrelated spending including a <number> percent increase in military spending by <number> in <number> south korea announced a fiveyear plan to spend more than <cur><number> billion on its defense which would mean annual increases of <number> percent on average and australia recently announced that it would spend a record <cur><number> billion on defense next year with further increases planned over the next few years > > our allies are also spending more on weapons platforms and munitions that are made in america combined with our own investments of supplemental funds for ukraine appropriated by congress this funding is being used to revitalize production lines across the country and is putting americans to work we are manufacturing weapons that make the united states and the world more secure while strengthening our economy > > the strength of the allied response to russias unprovoked invasion of ukraine has demonstrated why nato a <number>yearold alliance is still critical today when the united states became aware of vladimir putins plan to invade president biden consulted with our allies and built a coalition to support ukraine some were skeptical that russia would follow through but when it did they stood with the ukrainian people americas ironclad support for nato reassured our allies that we would have their back if russia attacked them this allowed them to give ukraine crucial air defenses and munitions that they may have withheld for their own defense had they believed that the alliance was hollow and it was every nation for itself > > this is the first time since world war ii that our european partners have carried more of the burden than the united states in a major conflict america has contributed many billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to help ukraine defend itself europe has spent more according to the kiel institute for the world economy which tracks overall international support to ukraine the united states gave ukraine <cur><number> billion <number> billion euros between january <number> and the end of april <number> europe gave <cur><number> billion <number> billion euros including longrange missiles the high mobility artillery rocket system armored fighting vehicles air defense systems and

remains to be done our allies need to spend more we must continue our urgent work of strengthening our defense industry and investing in innovation we must continue to deepen our alliances and strengthen deterrence we must keep working to integrate ukraine into the euroatlantic community to help support a longterm foundation for peace and stability in europe > > we expect to make

jaroslaw kuisz is a political analyst and historian karolina wigura is a historian of ideas they wrote from warsaw and berlin > i know it sounds devastating polands prime minister donald tusk said this year but we have to get used to the fact that a new era has begun the prewar era fresh from ousting national populists from power mr tusk is widely respected yet his words may come as a surprise considering the war in gaza russias onslaught in ukraine and conflict in sudan can we still speak of a prewar era > > mr tusk a former president of the european council could perhaps be accused of eurocentrism but his remark is right we are not in a traditional war yet of all the conflicts currently playing out the one in ukraine which pitches autocratically aligned russia against westernbacked ukraine has the greatest potential to become a fullblown world war for nato members gathered this week in washington working out how to stop that from happening will be at the top of the agenda > > theyre unlikely to agree though for the two and a half years since russias invasion western countries have pursued divergent sometimes contradictory approaches to the war behind each countrys policy is a special perspective informed by history its like a pair of glasses casting the war in a different light as vladimir putin threatens nuclear escalation and ukraine suffers further assaults its essential that nato members decide together how they should see the war in ukraine and how best to bring it to an end > > some believe that we are on the eve of a wider war experiencing an equivalent of something that happened <number> years ago this is the view through sarajevo glasses in that balkan city on a hot summer day in <number> a young assassin opened fire on archduke franz ferdinands vehicle setting off a chaotic sequence that led to world war i that war which was extraordinarily devastating began somewhat by accident the historian christopher clark has called the political class of the time sleepwalkers through a complex mix of emotions offended honor and recklessness they wandered unwittingly into war > > for those who see the situation through this lens the conflict in ukraine must not be allowed to become the equivalent of ferdinands killing the starting pistol of a world war they speak in a pacifist tone attention step by step we are heading toward a global maybe even nuclear conflict even if no one actually wants it the conclusion for them is simple for fear of alarming russia into an irreversible escalation ukraines military ambitions must be restrained and diplomatic negotiations sought > > these sarajevo glasses seem to be worn most prominently in germany since february <number> chancellor olaf scholz has strenuously made the case for supporting ukraine and his country is one of the most important exporters of material aid and weapons to ukraine yet at the same time with every new delivery he repeatedly warns at some point one drone one plane may be too many his emphasis is always on caution and the aim ultimately to find some sort of negotiated settlement on the streets of berlin during the recent european elections posters bearing mr scholzs image promised to ensure peace > > others wear an entirely different pair of glasses call them munich ones their historical point of reference comes from <number> when adolf hitler demanded a part of czechoslovakia and the european powers in the spirit of appeasement agreed to it the annexation was meant to satisfy the appetites of the third reich and so avoid a repeat of the great war but appeasement came at the expense of other countries as eastern and central europeans will tell you > > it also on its own terms failed appeasement collapsed like a house of cards with germanys attack on poland in <number> leading the rest of europe and eventually the globe to world war ii this is exactly what mr tusk seeks to avoid in this view naive decisions result only in more victims and suffering in more cities warsaw then mariupol today burned and bombed to the ground the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated they argue no concessions should be made to hitlers modernday counterpart > > apart from ukraine itself and poland these glasses are worn by countries in the surrounding region finland the baltic states romania moldova president emmanuel macron of france seems to have changed from sarajevo to munich glasses over the past two years an initial advocate of negotiations and diplomacy he recently gave a speech sounding the alarm over the threat from russia europe can die mr macron warned in a strikingly eastern european tone the weakening of his authority after the recent election could disrupt this view > > what about washington the united states of course entered the world wars late the buildup of both has little resonance on the other side of the atlantic instead americas perspective comes from the trauma that drew it into world war ii the attack on pearl harbor in <number> that unexpected assault in which more than <number> us personnel were killed taught the united states that if it does not have a carefully calibrated presence in conflicts it may pay a far greater price the country resolved to never be surprised on its own territory ever again > > these pearl harbor glasses help explain americas conduct throughout the war where it has sought to support ukraine as much as possible up to the point where it would be at direct risk of retaliation this accounts for the vacillating quality of americas support as it wavers between more or less active approaches always anxious about russian escalation the problems this has created not least in the delayed aid package to ukraine are plain to see > > in <number> we are not in sarajevo munich or pearl harbor but that does not change the profound effect these perspectives have each pair of glasses not only shapes an intellectual analysis of current events but also entails a strong moral conviction of being right even superior it is this feeling rather than the mere choice of historical analogy that can lead protagonists to close themselves off from listening to one another > > yet there is a way to reconcile all sides it lies in understanding that we are not in an oldfashioned prewar era but a new era of hybrid war this multifaceted war with the west and its core political values is already happening across the globe not only in europe but also in africa asia and the middle east and if there are not yet russian drones flying over european union countries fighting is already underway on other fronts if only for now in the form of disinformation spying and hacking the analogies of sarajevo munich and pearl harbor are all useful for building a new perspective fit for the st century > > we are not condemned to repeat the past instead we can freely choose what action to take this is the essence of belief in democracy on both sides of the atlantic nothing happens twice as wislawa szymborska reminds us in her wise poem our view is that nato members should put the alliances arsenal of resources at ukraines disposal to ensure russia is defeated

republican party complain bitterly about having to defend wealthy countries that by the way can afford social safety nets that america can only dream of because they dont spend as much on their militaries its also because us officials are becoming more focused on the challenges posed by china which will require an increasing amount of attention and resources in the years ahead especially

fry > > its starting to happen but not nearly as quickly as it should the nato summit will no doubt celebrate the fact that <number> nato members are expected to spend at least <number> percent of their gdp on defense up from just three members that met that threshold a decade ago but its stunning that nearly a third of natos <number> members still fell short of that spending goal which was agreed upon in <number> if russias fullscale invasion of ukraine and mr trumps notsosubtle threats to abandon freeloaders havent convinced them to pony up more for their own defense its hard to

should be primarily responsible for its own defense while aiming to preserve the nato alliance according to a recent survey by the institute for global affairs only <number> percent of german and

continent finlands former president sauli niinisto has called for a more european nato and president emmanuel macron of france has warned that however strong our alliance with america is we are not a priority for it > > so why does this dependence persist > > part of the reason is human nature why would allies invest in defense if uncle sam always picks up the tab but another reason is structural when nato was created european allies were just emerging from devastating wars that left them suspicious of and even hostile to one another somebody had to herd the cats > > thats how the us role in nato changed from that of temporary helper to permanent protector at first nato was like a policeman watching over a construction site the alliance went hand in hand with the marshall plan if americans were going to help rebuild europe they had to make sure that moscow didnt steal their investment > > but by the s it had become obvious that us troops wouldnt be leaving anytime soon the soviet union had swallowed up much of eastern europe including the eastern part of germany that made west germany key to stopping the soviets but few in europe could stomach the idea of a strong german military after what had happened under the nazis so the americans stayed put and protected germany with their own troops and nuclear umbrella > > the present system did not take shape because america had set out to become a kind of empire marc trachtenberg a political scientist at the university of california los angeles who has written extensively about the cold war told me the system came into being because us leaders realized by <number> that there could be no purely european solution to the european security problem the americans he said were stuck in europe > > once washington realized it couldnt leave it started calling the shots we are bound to pay the price of leadership mcgeorge bundy president john f kennedys national security adviser said in <number> we may as well have some of its advantages > > that meant juicy defense contracts for american firms which became a powerful financial incentive to keep a big footprint in europe its one reason poland buys american tanks that are too heavy to cross polish bridges and romania buys fighter jets that are extremely expensive to operate and maintain the us military industrial complex profits from dependency about <number> percent of the military equipment that european union countries purchased in <number><number> came from the united states > > at the end of the cold war europeans tried to wean themselves off us military might in <number> prime minister tony blair of britain and president jacques chirac of france attempted to create a european security system capable of acting on its own but secretary of state madeleine albright nipped that in the bud in a speech that warned against diminishing natos role duplicating natos efforts and discriminating against nato members that werent in the european union > > in <number> <number> european countries started the permanent structured cooperation on security and defense to work together on practical projects such as cyberdefense that too got a negative reaction from the trump administration which warned against excluding american firms > > its no wonder that today europe lacks the capacity to deploy the soldiers and equipment that nato needs to defend its members especially when it comes to specialized units such as air defense intelligence and surveillance john r deni the author of a new report on nato readiness told me that nato planners routinely come up short when they seek contributions of sophisticated systems partly because so much has already been sent to ukraine there is just not enough to go around he said there are still troubling gaps > > luckily some european leaders are treating this with the urgency it deserves at the summit nato allies are expected to endorse a new defense industrial pledge to scale up the production of weapons and ammunition but natos procurement plan relies heavily on american arms makers that clashes with the new european defense industrial strategy rolled out by the european

> i have an unwavering belief that in <number> when the country celebrates <number> years of independence my country will be a developed india > > thus did narendra modi indias prime minister address his country on independence day <number> is his aspiration a feasible one yes is it a plausible one no but it is still likely that india will be a superpower by that time with an economy on one measure as large as that of the us so how might india get there what challenges will it face what might it mean for the world > > i addressed the topic of indias economic future in lectures last week at the national council of applied economic research and the consumer unity and trust society in new delhi i illustrated the challenge of becoming a highincome country by comparing india with the poorest country ranked as advanced by the imf greece in <number> indias gdp per head at purchasing power parity ppp was just under a quarter of that of greece if greek gdp per head grows at a mere <number> per cent its <number><number> trend with imf forecasts and indias grows at <number> per cent its <number><number> trend indias gdp per head would only be <number> per cent of greeces in <number> if its gdp per head were to match that of greece by <number> the rate of growth in gdp per head would need to rise to <number> per cent a year that rate of growth would not be far below that of china from <number> to <number> when it achieved the astounding annual rate of <number> per cent > > the picture of aggregate size is rather different un forecasts indicate that by <number> indias population will be <number>bn against <number>bn in china and mn in the us with more than four times the population it will not be hard for india to match total us economic output indeed if indias gdp were to grow at only <number> per cent a year to <number> well below its <number><number> trend annual rate of <number> per cent and us gdp were to grow at <number> per cent its <number><number> trend rate on a similar basis indias economy at ppp would equal that of the us > > the us would still be more technologically advanced and have far higher productivity indias manufacturing prowess is also unlikely ever to match that of china the share of its industrial sector in gdp is not only far smaller than chinas but is already in decline yet size matters with its huge population and a big economy india would be a superpower not fully matching china or the us but unquestionably a great power > > what might prevent this from happening one reason might be the slowdown in global economic growth noted in the imfs april <number> world economic outlook the impact and extent of this structural slowdown with chinas deceleration and demographic change elements in the picture could be worsened by a big jump in protectionism triggered by donald trumps possible reelection in the longer term the climate crisis might affect economic growth as well as human welfare more broadly as i argued last week also far from unimaginable is war among the superpowers against this some hope artificial intelligence will reignite economic growth but that is questionable > > a crucial point is that indians will need their economy to grow at least twice as fast as global output this means that its exports will also have to grow at least twice as fast as global output if the trade ratio is not to fall otherwise the economy would become ever more closed > > in a recent paper shoumitro chatterjee and arvind subramanian argue against any renewed bout of aversion to trade they note the widespread belief that india is a large country with a large market but the true market size for tradeable goods and services is somewhere between <number> and <number> per cent of gdp given the widespread poverty > > again some argue that exports have not been important for indian growth but exports have in fact been crucial not least because they pay for necessary imports increase competition and offer access to global knowhow finally people argue that global opportunities are disappearing but indias share in world merchandise exports excluding intraeu trade was a mere <number> per cent in <number> against chinas <number> per cent even its exports of commercial services were only <number> per cent of the world total far below the us share of <number> per cent and chinas <number> per cent > > moreover and crucially india has strengths it is an obvious plus one in a world of china plus one india has good relations with the west to which it is strategically important but it is also important enough to matter to everybody else it could be what the imf calls a connector country in the world economy indeed it can and should lead in the liberalisation of trade domestically and globally india also has the advantage of its diaspora which is enormously influential especially in the us not least indias human resources give it the capacity to diversify and upgrade the economy over time it must exploit this size in short gives the country weight india is not just constrained by the world it can and must shape it > > what will matter most however is how india manages itself its biggest challenges are internal maintaining stability improving education defending the rule of law upgrading infrastructure providing a firstclass environment for investment encouraging inward investment and accelerating its shift towards clean energy > > the recent elections have made me more optimistic the country should continue to have a stable government but modis bjp has been humbled i hope this will persuade the government to focus its efforts on the economy and welfare of the population rather than on indias very own culture wars india can be an influential and immensely
