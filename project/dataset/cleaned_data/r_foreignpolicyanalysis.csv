welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing ukraine<url> howdy folks happy saturday todays video is anders puck nielsons recent release<url> he goes into detail as to us house speaker mike johnsons his son monitors his porn use yes you read that right request for a concrete us strategy is an impossibility its interesting youd like to watch an intelligent expert express perplexion at the inanity of american politics he carries the same confused energy as the parents filming all those videos on rkidsarefuckingstupid<url> now lets get to it shall we >a recent video appeal by a serbian mercenary addressed to russian president vladimir putin has unleashed discussions about an ongoing clan war within the kremlin and the russian information space against the backdrop of the russian presidential campaign man this serbian thing isnt going away is it mostly ive been ignoring this drama because i expected putin to take care of it relatively quickly one to two days not a big deal three days and no resolution now im beginning to ask whats taking so long these serbs right theyre serving under a vdv regiment ostensibly elite yet theyre complaining about mistreatment lack of weapons and suicidal assault orders they requested transfer to a chechen unitkeep in mind these are foreign volunteersand were denied sort of and when these foreign volunteers decided that enough was enough russia pointed guns at them and declared them guilty of treason this is how the russian army treats its foreign volunteers those considering signing that contract beware it isnt worth the paycheck i find this drama fascinating because of what it reveals about kremlin politics as well as the logistics situation on the russian side of the line apparently these vdv units are sponsored as in an oligarch chooses a unit funds its supplies and its success or failure dictates their position within putins pecking order its honestly a clever twist on cruelty simultaneously democratizing the expense of the war while solving the critical question of corruption gee golly gosh this sounds familiar where else have i seen keys to power responsible for supply fielding and maintaining a housecarl for contribution to the state in times of war >infighting and factional dynamics within the kremlin are not new phenomena and do not indicate the imminent collapse of putins regime particularly because power verticals are the foundation of putins regime youre damn right they are feudalism is an ancient system but a stable one when one is king one must be strong yes but how strong the answer is always proportional to the strength and quantity of the vassals keep the vassals fighting keep them too weak to dream of the throne yet strong enough to be effective this is the basic tenant of the prince robert baratheon explains nicely the flaw in putins foundation of power<url> putin needs to play this game every moment of every day each of his decisions considers this dynamic so we can use this knowledge as a predictor of future behavior >a fire destroyed a large warehouse in st petersburg belonging to russias largest online retailer wildberries on january <number> burn baby burn at first glance i thought this was a result of ukrainian intelligence yet that doesnt seem to be the case the story the kremlin is releasing is that a fight broke out between several hundred laboring migrants escalating to the point where military police needed to intervene the fight apparently resulted in the warehouse burning and most of the work crew drafted to ukraine things mustve been pretty shit to have escalated to this point >russian forces are reportedly increasingly using chemical weapons in ukraine in continued apparent violations of the chemical weapons convention to which russia is a party those mother fuckers this is russia putting its toe into the water theyre using nonlethal chemicals yet this is clearly to test the wests response how much pushback the kremlin receives will likely dictate whether they decide to unleash the lethal stuff the more desperate putin gets the more likely the chances hell unleash the truly horrific shit in the soviets vaults >russian forces made confirmed advances near kreminna and avdiivka amid continued positional engagements along the entire front line theres been a marked decrease in ukrainian offensive activity around bakhmut recently avdiivka remains active and the buildup continues in kupyansk isw reports around krynky ukrainian drones are so dense the rf mod needs to preannounce when their drones are active so their own soldiers dont try to shoot them down tacitly admitting of course that russia is not capable of flying drones at all hours of the day and night >russian forces launched a mediumsized drone missile and air attack against ukraine on the night of january <number><number> using a strike package similar to recent russian strike packages good and bad news here bad news first twelve missiles out of forty got through no idea what they hit good news ukraine neutralized twentyeight missiles twenty of which through electronic warfare yeah apparently ukraine has a new ew system that can neutralize inbound missiles we knew this thingwhatever it iscould knock down drones but this is the first time weve seen it deployed against a missile most of todays knockdowns are attributed to this device something domestically produced and not dependent upon the wests largesse well done >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children to russia for medical reasons in <number> please give ukraine what they need to bring this to an end<url> q for the community what in your estimation are the strengths and weaknesses of a feudalistic power structure join the conversation over on

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing united states<url> >sky news reported that the us consulate in erbil was attacked by longrange missiles with great destructive capacity additionally sky news reported that several missiles were intercepted before reaching the us base at erbil airport okay so apparently this is happening im told iran missed the us consulate and instead murdered a prominent member of the kurdish community the word going around is that this guy was well liked though that may be a disinformation campaign perhaps with the goal of encouraging military action in yemen to be honest its getting really fucking hard to tell lately the amount of misinformation swirling around is the worst ive ever seen it iran is trying to draw the west into a war that much is clear theyd like to make the war out to be our fault and theyd like it if we put boots on the ground in yemen that is also clear if both of these things are true then biden cannot allow himself to fall for this obvious trap we need to find an alternative to blunt application of force biden should ignore yemen and strike iranian assets thats play here the houthis are nothing without their persian backers they take literal direction from the irgc so to resolve this problem we must strike at the root its time to make iran pay for their transgressionsnot a lot but this warrants a direct response >donald trump romped to a decisive victory monday night in the frigid iowa caucuses cementing his formidable grip over the republican party and pushing the nation closer to a historic modern rematch with president biden<url> yep djt won iowa decisively somewhat surprisingly haley came in third desantis in second heres a helpful cheat sheet for the type who voted for each candidate <number> donald trump magarabid fascists foaming at the mouth with zealous bloodlust <number> ron desantis magarabid fascists yet still able to hold a coherent conversation these are the folks who arent in it for trump rather they think of fascism as more of a movement you know really get this whole whitepower thing going grassroots <number> nicki haley bogstandard conservatives staring slackjawed at the staggering consequences of their own ineptitude good job<url> but thats not the takeaway the takeaway is that republican voter turnout to the iowa caucus was a historic low thats fantastic news despite the bravado despite the chest thumping and victimhood people arent excited to vote for trump they see the writing on the wall trump is going down in flames and even the shittier economy bidens abysmal poll numbers and the gops endless drama less and less seem to think voting for djt is going to help lets hope this trend continues well know more as we move deeper into the primary ukraine<url> >ukrainian officials announced that ukrainian forces destroyed a russian a<number> longrange radar detection aircraft and severely damaged an il<number> airborne command post aircraft on the night of january <number> fuck yeah the wins just keep coming i have no damn clue how they pulled this off but it sureasfuck wasnt a patriot battery my totally ungrounded theory is that ukraine spent several weeks clearing aa from kherson oblast charted a path and chucked an f<number> through the corridor to fire off an overthehorizon strike on a brightasfuck radar signature so you know if people start spreading that rumor know that you heard it here first i started that disinformation completely unfounded and based purely upon supposition call em out on it and link back here<url> itll help this place grow shortterm isw says the consequences for this shootdown will mean a difficult time targeting strikes on ukrainian assets in kherson oblast strategic or otherwise longtermwho the fuck knows longterm hasnt been a word in the russian lexicon for almost two years at this point >a senior ukrainian intelligence official confirmed that russian forces can generate forces at a rate equal to russian monthly personnel losses which is consistent with isws assessment that russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in ukraine yeah okayso like k day but for how long i have to ask how long can the kremlin continue to hide the effects of their crypto mobilization how are they going to mesh this with their exacerbating labor shortage their declining demographic situation these are all uncomfortable questions both for russia and for putin these are atrocious losses against an opponent purely on the defensive think about it ukraine isnt attacking anywhere eight hundred a day is what the kremlin now suffers baseline >german outlet bild reported on classified german documents describing a hypothetical scenario to prepare for a possible future conflict between nato and russia developing such scenarios which are usually classified is a normal task for professional military staffs this thing hit the front page of rnoncredibledefense today i dismissed it at the time becausewell i was on rnoncredibledefense but apparently it was real the plan is purely military worstcasescenario thinking its their job to war game this sort of thing still terrifying to think about though >russia and iran are preparing to sign a grand interstate treaty to further develop russianiranian militarytechnological cooperation okayso is that going to be their alliance name kinda lame if you ask me the grand interstate doesnt have the same ring as the axis powers or the triple entente trust the kremlin to give our generation the shittiest version of our grandparents defining conflict >russian forces made confirmed advances west of donetsk city and near krynky amid continued positional fighting along the entire line of contact the lines are more fluid than they might seem confirmed advance means someone got to someplace new and took a photo it doesnt mean they held that new place nor that theyre still there nor that the attack succeeded nor that the place was more than a foot or two farther than the day before it just means somebody crawled on their belly to take a picture in a new locale thats not why im bringing this to your attention >russian sources claimed that freezing weather conditions are inhibiting ukrainian boat movements and landings on the east bank because the dnipro and konka rivers and channels are frozen<number> are they fucking high<url> like yeah sure the temperature sometimes drops below freezing but its not exactly subzero is it and considering a river generally you know moves it keeps a constant inflow of heat into the system to prevent icing over the temperature has to be considerably below zero for an extended period of time for the fucking konka to freeze i wonder if this has anything to do with the bullshit excuse they gave about why they cant put planes in kherson oblast that it was too cold to fly a fucking jet >the ukrainian main military intelligence directorate gur stated that ukrainian resistance forces detonated a russian military uaz patriot vehicle in occupied melitopol zaporizhia oblast injuring four russian personnel and killing an unspecified number of personnel hell yeah well done gur it seems melitipol partisans are alive and well >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children to russia for medical reasons in <number> please give ukraine what they need to bring this to an

> but thats not the takeaway the takeaway is that republican voter turnout to the iowa caucus was a historic low thats fantastic news despite the bravado despite the chest thumping and victimhood people arent excited to vote for trump turnout was affected by the extreme cold they are having in iowa so its a little soon to conclude that people are not excited to vote for trump personally i think that only about half of people voted for trump is the upside here because that means in that other half there will be voters who are definitely unenthusiastic trump voters come the general election add in a real conviction or two and trump is looking to be positioned to win the gop primaries but lose the general election pretty hard one can hope,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMENIdVE5NVFTeGJBZGdPV2VXaXdSZ3lrWFZGeFZZYlllb1Z2YjJtWFFLZVFrQlVVcHFxZVdHZkwtcm1HZDVaaEVlc056bDFpSkFEendQQ0pIaGxEVWc9PQ==

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing ukraine<url> howdy folks lets get to it >russian tactical aviation operations are reportedly decreasing near the sea of azov and russian aviation capabilities may be degraded after ukrainian forces destroyed a russian a<number> longrange radar detection aircraft and caused severe damage to a russian il<number> airborne command post aircraft on the night of january <number> oh i love me some consequences right so theres a flurry of narratives flying around regarding that craftthat russian shot it down themselves that ukraine shot it down that ukraine didnt shoot it down but its definitely down russia has endless replacements and it doesnt matter that its down to and this ones my personal favorite israel did it i mean why not right the point is the a<number> is down and the ilm is out of action were seeing an immediate shortterm effect where the kremlin is hesitant to stick anything over the sea of azov they dont know why they lost their five jets last month and they dont know why they lost this thing without the vantage point the a<number> offered the kremlin will find it extremely difficult to fly anything over kherson oblast i cant help but wonder will the kremlin keep winging about the cold into july >at least two stateowned chinese banks reportedly ordered reviews of their business with russian clients and will sever ties with sanctioned russian entities and entities with ties to the russian defense industry man its just one thing after another for putin isnt it this man is in a tailspin even beijing is dumping his ass the jury is still out on whether this will mean anything beijing and moscow are tightly bound together economically its russian consumption and fossil fuels which prop up xis regime which means there is a significant push in the west to divest from the ccp this will mean declining import revenues especially critical because chinas housing crisis seems to only be exacerbating given the censorship i wouldnt be surprised if theyre covering up a devastating economic crisis its usually a bad sign when a government ceases to release regular economic figures<url> >russian president vladimir putin continued to demonstrate that russia is not interested in negotiating with ukraine in good faith and that russias maximalist objectives in ukraine which are tantamount to full ukrainian and western surrender remain unchanged the west offered an olive branch over christmas they spread the rumor of backchannel talks they delayed aid announcements and generally faffed about while ukraine remained in a purely defensive posture that was putins out his last chance of clinging to power all he had to do was give up what hed stolen and walk away its an offer thats likely still on the table putin dont seem like hes going to take it though >russian president vladimir putin notably amplified a longstanding kremlin effort to set information conditions for future escalations against baltic countries likely as part of his wider effort to weaken nato but why though there is a conversation in switzerland right now over what the world should do regarding the imminent collapse of putins government by threatening further war during a peace conference while iran is chucking missiles he is actively working against his own interests people are unified by fear by a common foe and in attempting to intimidate us he is triggering that exactsame collective tendency this tendency is what makes fascism work in the first place which is exactly the ideology he is attempting to inject into his people how he fails to make the connection is beyond me >the ukrainian verkhovna rada adopted a law on its second reading to digitalize ukrainian military records on january <number> i consistently forget just how far behind in this war ukraine started theyve really had a rough go of it over the last thirty years havent they poor bastards modernization isnt a quality of character but it does demand solid institutions do the work give a shit and eventually the world becomes a better place its how its always been and it warms my heart to see ukraines efforts pay off >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children to russia for medical reasons in <number> please give ukraine what they need to bring this to an end<url> q for the community what do you think the folks in switzerland are talking about right now join the conversation over on rthenuttyspectacle<url>,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM3VOWVh5WlBWeUk5WGlDRzlqVlZFTTMxU3BhcS16Q3hqTFYxZHRyR0hKb1NPRVV2NWxqUy1WTjhhQmpTNVhrc19RTWdFSEM3WEtsb0pVdUxHOURTSWs0a1lvUWJRUjgzdFpONkZGNEVQaXM9
welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing correction<url> howdy folks nope still not about fs ive set my conditions the kremlin must demonstrate the ability to consistently drop glide bombs on krynky before im willing to admit that supposition is incorrect that hasnt happened todays correction has to do with a flippant comment i made on january th<url> regarding ice along the konka river impeding traffic of ukrainian supplies to krynky i was wrong to call bullshitturns out i dont know nothing about meteorology this guy<url> does though he says the konka is seeing significant icing over and that the dnipro will soon experience similar problems this is important because ice along the dnipro can interfere with ukraines ability to deliver supplies into krynky falling into the cold water and freezing to death is obviously a threat though this is war and threats are to be acknowledged not avoided the real problem is the ice which can complicate logistics while under hostile enemy fire ice shards can damage the propellers of landing craft and make landing of heavy equipment impossible special thanks to unitrosyfi for the call out at the end of the day none of us know what the hell is happening so its only through our collective pooling of experience that we can maybe possibly get a hint of what is going on please everyone if i am wrong please speak up in the comments by doing so you will improve rthenuttyspectacle for unitrosyfis contribution i award them the flair probably correct about planes may they wear it with pride ukraine<url> >significant protests erupted in baymak bashkortostan republic following a russian courts guilty verdict for a prominent bashkort activist prompting a swift russian government response as well as backlash from the russian ultranationalist community woah thats a spark several thousand people rioted in baymak today in outrage at fail alsynovs arrest the charges are bullshit obviously apparently this alsynov fella called some other group of people black and that somehow means he deserves four years in a russian prison seems excessive to me but whatever floats the kremlins boat the problem is this dude was a prominent member of the significant bashkort minority his people turned out in the thousandsisw estimates somewhere between kk took to the streets obviously the kremlin cracked down hard with nonviolent methods yet the protest only seemed to dissolve once the local authorities agreed to release the <number><number> people theyd detained this is significant because it implies the mob is highly organized relatively speaking<url> its leaders can disperse the protest at will meaning they have respect and recognition by the community so there is a semblance of a hierarchy the question were all waiting on now i suppose is whether the protestsll continue into tomorrow >the russian ultranationalist community will likely concretize xenophobia and insecurities about russias ethnic composition as key shared principles within the community in <number> as russian ultranationalists continue to seize on incidents involving migrants and nonethnic russian groups to call for antimigrant policies and express growing hostility towards nonethnic russians in russia naturally the russian ultranationalists seized upon these protests as further validation of their xenophobia see the problem playing the hard right is that theyre an inherently exclusionary bunch and in a country as big as the russian federation that doesnt exactly work true russians whatever the fuck that means typically equals a handful of cities and oblasts so why they think they have claim to ukraine is anyones guess i swear to god the kremlins reason for this war has somehow gone from were going to liberate ukraine from the nazis to blood alone moves the wheels of history these people are a nation of hypocrites >widespread russian milblogger complaints about an uzbek community leader in russia prompted the russian investigative committee to open a criminal investigation suggesting that the russian government may feel increasing pressure to respond to milblogger demands as the ultranationalist information space coalesces around xenophobic and antimigrant ideals the kremlin is growing increasingly responsive to the milblogger community as the general russian population appears to turn against them declining approval for the war combined with the two protests over the last four months today and the caspian pogroms theres an increasing resistance by the russian people towards putins war xenophobia and nationalism might just be putins best bet for retaining power but in doing so he risks ripping his empire apart >a ukrainian intelligence official reported that russian forces lack the necessary operational reserves to conduct simultaneous offensive efforts in more than one direction in ukraine translation russia can do one thing at a time if theyre active in one area thats likely all theyre focused on ukraine posits russias current focus is gearing up in kupyansk for another offensive which if theyre stupid enough to attempt will fully occupy their attention well into march its likely meant to coincide with purins farcical election perhaps climaxing with a victory or bigass missile barrage the day before russians go to the polls putin demonstrated time and time again that he cares more about optics than longterm military progress >ukraine successfully employed a ukrainianrefurbished hybrid air defense system frankensam for the first time woot the frankensams are out to play these things integrate soviet aa with nato ammunition easing pressure on a finite depleting resource s<number> missiles because the west sure as fuck arent going to build those things >germany and france announced additional military assistance to ukraine on january <number> and theyre big commitments germany supplied <cur><number> billion in military assistance throughout all of <number> today schultz pledged <cur><number> billion fuck yeah deutschland france meanwhile donated a whopping forty storm shadow missiles along with several hundred bombs whatever the ominous fuck that means >the threat of us secondary sanctions is reportedly having a largescale effect on turkishrussian financial ties contrary to what putin was hoping it seems the west is solidifying germany just ramped up their yearonyear commitment france the uk and most of eastern europe are showering ukraine in aid and the us is putting the screws to putins wallet good these are all good things now if biden manages to jam through an aid package before february i will be overjoyed >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children to russia for medical reasons in <number> please give ukraine what they need to bring this to an end<url> q

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing ukraine<url> i swear to god fetal alcohol syndrome is a prerequisite for working in the kremlin >russian forces recently made confirmed advances southeast of kupyansk and ukrainian forces recently regained positions southeast of kupyansk amid continued positional engagements along the entire line of contact so begins another russian clusterfuck<url> to be honest i didnt think they were stupid enough to try it i thought this might be a feint a chance to build up their forces lick their wounds and take a breatherlike an actual honest to god breather the russian mod havent had a chance to internalize the results of their avdiivka fuck up nor to disseminate the lessons amongst trainees what is the new game plan what will make kupyansk different from vuhledar bakhmut and avdiivka to be clear the information environment is still sketchy but isw appears confident theres been a significant uptick in russian activity in the region sure maybe this is nothing but in just a couple days the claim is russias lost over fifty pieces of armor if this actually is for real like no playplay then this is it this is putins final offensive like i know what the media saysi know what us officials say and trust me well get to that but i dont see where putin goes from here hes down to pressganging migrants off the street infrastructure is crumbling and there are riots just north east of the caspian like these are all signs the kremlin is operating at capacity yet the demand seems only to grow ukraine isnt even attacking not seriously they are purely defensive yet the kremlins problems are constantly exacerbating what happens when ukraine presses the go button what other resource can the kremlin draw on putins tapped hes dropping plates more and more lately >russian forces will be able to determine the location tempo and operational requirements of fighting in ukraine if ukraine commits itself to defensive operations throughout <number> as some us officials are reportedly pressing kyiv to do alrighty we should get some shit out of the way first storyteller has many tendencies one of which is the tendency to favor aggression<url> i dont know how strong ukraine is because isw doesnt assess their position they focus their intention entirely on the russian side of the lines so i am not privy to ukraines weaknesses i look at <number> abrams tanks and i think to myself where the fuck have those been all war then i look at headlines and i see everyone bitching about ukraines weakness with nothing specific to back it up like lets look at the dods statement critically they do not think ukraine should go on the offensive until <number> we are in mother fucking january and they are making that statement am i supposed to take that seriously man half of todays text was the isw outlining the phenomenal stupidity of the dods suggestion i earnestly feel the west is attempting to spin a ukraine weak narrative in preparation of a crossing of the dnipro though i am aware it means discounting popular consensus and the public statements of most officials its a hypothesis that demands a lot of assumptions so i encourage everyone to lend it very little credence >us officials reportedly assess that ukraine will have to fight a long war and continue efforts to secure as much security assistance as possible for ukraine before <number> while expecting that positional fighting may continue in ukraine until <number> yeah so apparently the plan is to spend all of <number> arming ukraine for a maybe offensive in <number> at least thats the tone im getting from these weirdass announcements in fact the entire world seems to be playing possum almost as if to lure putin into a false sense of security this whole thing might just be to trick him into kicking things off in kupyansk yes im aware its conspiratorial but i just dont buy that ukraine is as weak as they claim >russia is trying to mend its relationship with south korea to mitigate the impacts of its growing reliance on north korea cant unburn that bridge bub sorry >russian president vladimir putin signed a decree allocating funds for the search registration and legal protection of russian property abroad which includes property in former territories of the russian empire and soviet union the text of this law was apparently very vague as to what constituted property which could just as well be a claim on anything the soviet union ever touched frankly its a delusional decree one not in respecting the sovereignty of their neighbors it essentially announces they will loot anything they can get their hands on its legalize pillaging >protests in support of an imprisoned prominent bashkort activist continued in the republic of bashkortostan but kremlin mouthpieces denied reports that the protests are significant in scale the kremlin is tight lipped about these protests meaning they likely want us to look anywhere but here i say fuck them i say we look closer i say im going to make these protests the headline every day theyre up and about these people deserve to be seen rumor is there were between several hundred to fifteenhundred protestors in the crowd today last time the kremlin laid in with tear gas and batons only dispersing the crowd because a local official agreed to release the people theyd arrested today they likely started with tear gas and batons and just escalated yet somehow the crowd stayed the entire day lets hope they can do a third >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children to russia for medical reasons in <number> please give ukraine

<number> indicates that russian forces captured krokhmalne km northwest of svatove and russian milbloggers earlier claimed that ukrainian forces withdrew from positions near the settlement isw isnt ready to declare this an official offensive because they havent received pictures and videos but it seems pretty clear to me that this things for real but both sides are reporting significant spikes in action and when both russians and ukrainians agree that something is happening im inclined to believe its happening you dont need to see video evidence iswdrop your standards not as low as mine of course ukraine isnt releasing results so we dont know how theyre doing on the defense word is the kremlins dumping loads of armor into the assaults on kupyansk probably at least somewhat equal to what they were dumping into avdiivka in the early days for the kremlin to be willing to launch an offensive theyd have to feel confident of their numbers likely the losses are obscene as too they were in avdiivka theyd have to be to convince ukraine to yield krokhmalne<url> assuming this attack isnt just an extremely vigorous probe we can likely expect footage to start rolling in over the next couple days if it hasnt already >a russian stormz instructor claimed on january <number> that rosgvardia personnel operating in occupied ukraine have systematic issues with equipment and weapons storage yeah

following a recent unsuccessful assault on terny<url><number>zdata=mmsxdbbbfxbdccmddsfgfjrmtentry=ttu these are geolocated lossesconfirmedwhich makes the russian activity in the kupyansk direction

admittedly elevated yet subdued offensive action across the front its no wonder that the narrative has shifted back to us politics ukraines sovietera artillery munition shortage and the kremlins bigscary stuffed bear to be clear i still think that ukraine will launch a major offensive in kherson oblast this winter ill likely reevaluate this belief along with my f<number> hypothesis if we hit march without seeing evidence of either sorry carl sagan but eventually the absence of evidence becomes the evidence of absence maybe its opposite is true in space but down here on earth we need to live in the real world at least when speaking of cabbages and kings march th ladies and gentlemen thats when you get to laugh at me >ukrainian southern operational command spokesperson colonel nataliya humenyuk stated that russian personnel are increasingly refusing to conduct assaults in the kherson direction because the russian command prohibits russian forces from using armored vehicle support during the attacks also still no russian aviation over kherson oblast you know its possible that the weak showing of russias offensive could be at least in part due to an overall lack of heavy equipment weve seen russia deploy armor to krynky yet despite ukraines continued occupation of this beachhead russia is afraid of committing anything more valuable than expendable human lives read brown people >kyrgyzstan issued a statement against russias continued practice of targeting naturalized migrants as part of ongoing cryptomobilization efforts say it with me now citizenship means

dubai<url> >russian officials and information space actors are attempting to further rhetorically justify russias invasion of ukraine by misrepresenting a decree that ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky signed on january <number> concerning discrimination against ethnic ukrainians in russia zelenskys decree does not establish any territorial demands upon russia as select russian ultranationalists falsely claimed honestly i think zelensky was doing a bit of trolling with this one he posted a map showing ukraines ethnic borders which more or less kicked russia out of the black sea that said announcements like this dont happen in a vacuum zelensky didnt wake up this morning and randomly decide to pull a funny rather this is a negotiation tactic ukraine anchored an acceptable peace agreement as dictated by ukraine it involves justifiable russian territorial concessions so while yeah sure its inflated in a way zelensky just set terms this is what ukraine will take if they completely defeat the russian army and occupy moscow its up to the kremlin to talk them down because the alternative is this keeps going until russia collapses putins choice either works for ukraine >polish prime minister donald tusk visited kyiv on january <number> and announced a new polish defense package for ukraine<url> this ones a bit weird as neither side announced the packages value im going to assume its big but then im an optimist i assume this because the kremlin recently used ew warfare to cut off polish gps which i doubt went over well with the poles either way for a guy i just learned existed i like this donald tusk fellow he gets storytellers<url> raddest dude of the week award it comes with a lifetime supply of imaginary macaroni fuck yeah poland >russian health minister

in this post i argue that while there are many unique factors involved in the fall of france by demythologizing the blitzkrieg there are enduring lessons that can be taken from it as illustrated by the case of ukraine based on karlheinz friesers book the blitzkrieg legend the german victory in the battle of france was not the product of a master plan but of superiority in basic principles that ultimately made a decisive victory possible by focusing on building out these capabilities rather than game changers ukraine stands the best chance of achieving the advantages necessary to liberate its occupied territories if you cant tell i highly recommend this book if youre more interested in a broader overview i also recommend gerhard p grosss the myths and reality of german warfare,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUElxT29XVlRjS1RvY3BuZ2d0TkJWNU5XTnNvSjVCblF1WS1xVU00eWIyWXdadTJ0Y0RPcXAwTnJXVFM1b1hYbUlObGVVWFZnTDlqdzFMa0VGUXlmbFE9PQ==
welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing ukraine<url> storyteller here bringing you todays most super important headline >russian authorities issued prison sentences in a number of highprofile cases on january <number> including that of imprisoned russian ultranationalist and former officer igor girkin why girkin four years behind bars four truly he is our generations mlk minus the charisma seriously if he could just be less of a human slug then maybe the fascists would have a symbol to rally around but no instead their furor is a fat incel in his fifties ladies please god go to your local comic bookstore just hang outdont let people like girkin become real save us >ukrainian and russian authorities opened criminal investigations into the january <number> russian il<number> military transport aircraft crash in belgorod oblast oh are we still on this fucking plane im glad to see theres common consensus to obey international law huzzah im sure that the kremlin will now allow independent investigators to get to the bottom of the matter right no ah well was worth a try >the kremlin is reportedly no longer offering pardons to convict recruits and is significantly changing the terms of their service likely in response to the reduction of the pool of convicts suitable for recruitment into russian force generation efforts look folks i know its a bit of a jolt but it turns out releasing the incarcerated now upgraded with ptsd carteblanche back into society with blanket pardons is a bit of a shit idea shocker i know luckily putin came to his senses and decided to cease the mass conscription of prisoners right right ah no i see here now hes just decided to cease pardoning them or releasing them at all actually apparently theyre still prisonersjust on the front line forever as literal cannon fodder turns out hell is real and it vacations in our realm under the guise of war lucky us looking through what the isw has outline i do not see any advantage to serving in the now stormv units prisoners arent paid they arent released theyre still prisoners and theyre not getting a pardon folks im beginning to think these people are literally slaves >russian forces are reportedly increasing their use of chemical weapons in ukraine in continued apparent violations of the chemical weapons convention to which russia is party you arent hearing about this because the west is practicing a new strategy we arent responding not publicly missiles through nato sky no comment gps downage in poland dont recall slicing of baltic data cable wasnt worth our time to investigate by not rising to the putins taunts we stifle him in a narrative vacuum its putins initiative constantly every action is because of him every taunt is from him every comment is from him and it means were constantly exposed to a hideous view of the world one we wish to change here though i think we should say something privately at least make russia understand this sort of thing isnt okay that the west will act if this escalates we definitely have significant room for escalation passing a ukrainian military aid package would be a damn good start for one thing a big one >the ukrainian security service sbu reportedly conducted a successful drone strike on a rosneft oil refinery in tuapse krasnodar krai on the night of january <number> to <number> yeah they did yall notice how these hits on russian refineries are growing more and more common theyre widespread toogeographically speaking destruction of this industry is going to cripple the russian economy to an incalculable level the kremlins entire power structure all of it rests on its ability to export fossil fuels and the collapse of that capacity will mean the collapse of putins government no fossil fuels means no revenue no revenue means no pensions and no pensions means no regime that is the current fundamental conundrum putin faces the moment the pension payments cease to match inflation is the moment the russian people will take to the streets<url> >bloomberg reported on january <number> that labor shortages in russia have increased wages in civilian sectors enough to compete with relatively lucrative military salaries likely making military service even less appealing to russian citizens yeah bloomberg thats called inflation theres a labor shortage because the kremlin is scooping up every migrant with a pulse meaning the wages are high and shits expensive because ukraine is blowing up the states chief source of revenue russia doesnt produce too much stuff to be honest so most everything needs to be imported putin is slowly coming to realize that he doesnt have enough people to pull all the levers russia isnt the soviet union and he isnt stalin >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported over <number> ukrainians including <number> children

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing correction<url> yep more minor shit see the problem with not having an editor is that sometimes things just slip through the cracks yesterday i mentioned that eagle pass was a national park inadvertently implying that it was some mountainous redoubt it is not eagle pass is the name of the town and shelby park is a city park within said town were talking this thing<url><number>zdata=mmsxfdfcfcxdafdmdd<number>sfgftnjdcnmeentry=ttu yes this is a city park a place where most civilized nations keep their ducks and barbed wire across our side of the shore will mostly impact said ducks as anyone with sense will be taking the two very conveniently placed bridges a klickorso to the south unless that has barbed wire across it too and men with guns actually now that im thinking about it thats probably exactly whats happening not that this clusterfuck isnt a super big deal mind you<url> it just changes the dynamic a bit ukraine<url> >the russian information space continued to promote narratives that attempt to manipulate domestic us political events to sow domestic instability in the us and interfere with us policy debates about further us military assistance to ukraine yep feeling that right now give me a chance god please give me a chance to kick putin in the balls a brief window in my future i care not how or why i am in such a moment in time but if you give me the opportunity to nail that piece of shit in the testicles i will do a good deed i will make my dog stop pissing on my neighbors lawn sure it doesnt sound like much but they just put so much effort into it and there is just this one spotthat she has tarnished its her favorite amen ps steel toed boots i dont need them but i will buy them just give me the word the good word thats all im asking i wont even keep the receipt it will be a legitimate purchase and if youre feeling it maybe like a sixmonth heads up i wanna hit the gym yknow do some leg days >a prominent kremlinaffiliated milblogger attempted to undermine the legitimacy of upcoming us elections<number> isw continues to assess that these claims are very likely part of a deliberate russian information campaign i dont think its going to work trumps in full tantrum mode every indicator is flashing red for the gop and putins got some problems back home he should probably focus on instead more on that later the information space might feel grim but i think underneath it all were coming together we saw protests in germany against fascism<url> and people swarming the streets in slovakia to stand against their farright government like look at this thing<url> those people fill the streets no i think the kremlins attempts to stir shit up is going to fall on very deaf ears this election cycle i think were about to see a surprising coalescence of support around nikki haley there are terrifying parallels between putin and trump and i think many moderate run of the mill conservatives want someoneyou know conservative not a second bite of a shitfilled twinkie >russian authorities are likely blocking communications in the sakha republic for the fourth consecutive day following january <number> protests in support of a russian citizen allegedly murdered by a naturalized russian citizen from tajikistan four days now of straight protests despite certainly stiff resistanceand after four days an escalating response < thats the key it means the situation is deteriorating and putin didnt institute a blackout for the bashkortostan riots whatever is happening in sakha<url> is for serious obviously thanks to the kremlin we cant know whats happening in the far depths of siberia but we can speculate i have looked into the bones and do you know what i saw godzilla he has risen from the deep this is not a riot this is nature punishing man for his hubris >uk outlet the telegraph reported on january <number> citing an unnamed western official that russia is spending roughly <number> percent of its gdp on the war in ukraine more than russian national spending on health and education waitthat isnt that coincidentally the exact same number the dumas budget last year<url> trippy theres that overlap still <number> gdp on the war doesnt leave much for the common person not after the oligarchs get their share its no wonder theres riots popping up all over the place the question i guess now iswhere does putin go from here how does he bring more to bear there aint much gas left in the tank >russian health minister

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing united states<url> >an iranianbacked militia conducted a oneway drone attack targeting us forces in northeastern jordan on january <number> killing three american service members and wounding another <number><number> this attack is part of the ongoing iranianled campaign to expel us forces from the middle east see none of what they did before hurt anyone it was something we tolerated fun and games now thats changed and i urge biden to do what needs to be done<url> ukraine<url> >russian foreign intelligence service svr director sergei naryshkin reiterated that the kremlin is not interested in any settlements short of the complete destruction and eradication of the ukrainian state likely in an ongoing effort to justify the longterm and costly russian war effort to domestic audiences folks i dont want to alarm anyone but i think we need to recognize that we are drifting perilously close to a third world war between the election meddling random acts of clandestine sabotage and everescalating threats we need to put aside our disbelief and recognize that we are under attack we are experiencing the slow onset of war bit by bit our options shrink putin is stealing our peace and hes getting away with it because we are too afraid to fight i want the maga ratfuckers in the house to recognize that three americans died today because their selfish cowardice if we had stood our ground earlier those people might still be alive if you havent already dive into maus<url> its the most important comic book you will ever read >the kremlin also continues to frame and justify a longterm russian war effort as part of an existential geopolitical confrontation with the west and nazism maus is unique in that it doesnt deal with the germans perspective not one bit its not the americans nor the french nor the british it follows a polespecifically a jewish one the central theme is one of relentless partitioning pieces are sliced off a gold watch for a fancy paper a neighbor for a loaf of bread grandparents for one more month in the ghetto the nazis took everything bit by bit its a hard novel to read but critical in understanding the threat we face >kremlin officials and mouthpieces continue to set information conditions to destabilize moldova likely as part of efforts to prevent moldovas integration into the eu and the west among other objectives yeah why not just keep slicin putin fuckin see where it gets you what i dont understand is why hes choosing to do this now moldova is all the way on the other side of ukraine and instigating more tension is the opposite of what he should be doing i thought the end game was to wait until the west lost interest what happened to that plan >the kremlin will likely use the withdrawals of mali burkina faso and niger from the economic community of west african states ecowas to continue efforts to expand russian influence in francophone africa huhit seems like a sizeable portion of central africa is pulling away from france and drifting towards the kremlin most of these countries are run by warlords masquerading as presidents so i doubt theyre manifesting the will of the people with these decisions >unnamed indian government sources stated that india wants to distance itself from russia its largest arms supplier because the war in ukraine has limited russias ability to provide india with munitions oh drama india has long had a love affair with russian military equipment the craps cheap rugged and gets the job done need a tank boom t<number> truck heres a ural sam cause american sky things are expensive a slightly used s<number> or better yet an asyettobedelivered s<number><url> that s<number> is actually a bit of a sticking point as many of the highend systems indias been ordering from russia are slow to arrive naturally indias getting a little heated first because they likely paid for it already and second because the world seems to be very rapidly spiraling into chaos weeeeeee of course to india i would like to remind them that they were shopping at the armsdealer equivalent of a dollar general it is not worth it to go complaining to the manager because even if you win youre still arguing over coupons in a dollar general >russian forces recently advanced near kreminna and avdiivka amid continued positional fighting throughout the theater rumor has it that russia will soon attempt a rotation in kherson oblast that would be remarkable as it would be the first time throughout the entirety of the war that the kremlin has tried something sogracious good on them im willing to be halfway through the rotation will be point at which they are the most vulnerable as existing troops will be eager to get out and incoming troops will be disoriented just saying >russian health minister mikhail murashko confirmed that russian authorities have deported

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> and were just going to ignore the fact that i fucked up on the date yesterday please remember that i know nothing united states<url> >the iranian regime falsely claimed that iran had no role in the january <number> oneway drone attack that killed three us servicemembers in northeastern jordan i kept my comments yesterday minimal because the information was still pouring in its been about a day and now we know a lot more first we figured out how iran pulled off their little trick and i gots to give em credit it was damn clever irans proxies shadowed an american drone on its way back to base meaning our sam systems detected one target instead of two now that we know how they did it however we can make certain we never fall for the same gimmick twice thatll be up to the us dod to figure out second western media actually did its fucking job and reported iran as the responsible party which is important because social media today was disgusting the bots the justifications the excuses the whataboutismsthey were all over the place and the sight made me sick when everythings stabilized and makes sense again we need to come together as a species and hash out some rules regarding information war democracy cant exist in this environment and third i think beau had the best take<url> hes right in that the solution is decapacitation but i think he underplays the importance of immediate reprisal every second that passes lengthens the distance between the event and our response the longer that time period stretches the more tenuous the connection and it isnt iran we need to dissuade its everyone else yeah eventually the us will slam a missile into some irgc command center or something but if it doesnt happen in the next week or so then what will message will that send to the houthis to hezbollah to the african juntas iran will understand that much is guaranteed but we also need to make our response unambiguous lest we allow the stupid and brutal to draw the wrong conclusions its not the nation states that im concerned aboutits the war lords the more confident they feel the more brush fires theyll start and the more likely this conflagration will smolder out of control escalate to deescalate its a wellworn doctrine in my opinion biden needs to nutup and do his fuckin job i dont want to be in the middle east either but unless we want to reexperience the geopolitical shitshow that was the afghani withdrawal we need to ensure any future movements happen on our terms that means reminding everyone now that the us president is the only one who decides where our military finds itself blow up the shahed manufacturing facilities do it at night to avoid civilians announce the attack beforehandwhat the fuck is iran going to do stop us please ukraine<url> isws been halfassing their reports lately and its pissing me off how am i supposed to keep people interested in the russoukraine war if they give me nothing to work with stingy bastards >the ukrainian ministry of defense mod denied rumors about the purported resignation or dismissal of ukrainian commanderinchief general valerii zaluzhnyi on january <number> this is it huh this is my headline a rumor wrapped in a kremlin psyop i need another drink to begin ukraine says this whole story is bullshit and considering the story hinges upon a decision by ukraine im inclined to believe them removing zaluzhnyi would mean a drastic change in ukraines plan for the future of the war which does not seem at all likely zaluzhnyi is a defensive minded general and any replacement would mean installation of one whos suicidally aggressive which isnt what this war demands itd be like installing colonel custer as overall entente command halfway through world war one we have this rumor thanks to a ukrainian peoples deputy oleksii honcharenko<url> essentially a midtier politician ukraine has about <number> of them and when youve got <number> of anything one or two of that number is bound to broken or bonkers and quite frankly i dont see why honcharenko would know this information he seems primarily wrapped up in immigration nothing in his wikipedia screams defense circles now the kremlin is amplifying this rumor because for months now theyve attempted to sow discord between zelenskyy and zaluzhnyi this story plays right into their little gimmick oh secret firing but why thats what they want everyone to be asking themselves the kremlin wants as little attention paid to their problems as possible i see that information blackout mother fuckers until kyiv announces something officially its not real >russia may be retooling aspects of its air defense umbrella in deep rear areas amid continued ukrainian drone strikes within russia how deep are we talking here the kremlin released footage of a successful downing of a ukrainian drone today on its way to one of their refineries they made a big hullabaloo about it whichgreat just as planned because if the kremlin has covered their fossil fuel refineries in aa then that means theyre going to have a hard time keeping sam coverage coherent throughout ukraine exertion of strength in one place always means weakness somewhere else >russia appears to be fueling and seizing on neoimperialist and nationalist sentiments in europe in order to drive wedges between ukraine and its western neighbors thats where all these weird partitioning stories that keep popping up stem from romania apparently wants odessa or something and hungary gets west ukraineits essentially putin promising portions of ukraine to nationalists to encourage their buyin and support and considering the prerequisite to become a neonationalist is a stunted sense of empathy these people are slobbering all over putins offer putins making a mistake though the scarier he makes himself the closer we draw together the free world isnt like the russian people we arent beaten down and hopelessbecause we know we can do better the west holds itself to an impossible standard not because we think we can obtain it but because we know we must try the conversations we have now on this website are only unique in medium the substance i guarantee thats unchanged they say history repeats and id say i agree every generation there is a tyrant every generation there are those who would rather cower and hide deny and exploit and every generation we must remind ourselves why we cherish liberty lest we forget her value >russian and ukrainian sources continued to disagree over the status of tabaivka southeast of kupyansk on january

hamlets its adorable considering the weight putins attempting to bring to bear isw intends to bring us an extended analysis of the rf offensive thus far shortly ill cover it when it pops up >ukrainian officials continued to deny rumors about the purported dismissal of ukrainian commanderinchief general valerii zaluzhnyi the dismissal rumor was bullshit yesterday and its still bullshit today >russian forces appear to be continuing to violate the chemical weapons convention to which russia is signatory this one actually signifies a significant escalation like sure the kremlins been dropping tear gas on krynky for months now and the west hasnt said a thing not a peep now the kremlin has escalated to this wackass shit >chloropicrin is primarily used as a soil fumigant that can be fatal when inhaled and it is sometimes classified as a riot control agent rca due to its harmful and irritant effects<number> the cwc prohibits the use of rcas in warfare this stuffs nasty essentially extrastrength bugspray and itll kill you if you breathe it for long enough it was used extensively in world war one which is how you know its good aint no cruelty like oldtimey cruelty kremlins dropping this shit from belgorod to zaporizhya five times in the last couple days extensive usage of chemical weapons would bebeyond barbaric and this isnt even close to the worst the kremlins got in its stockpile they should feel ashamed of themselves we left this chapter behind every country signed the chemical weapons convention for a damn reasoneven hitler didnt use these things on soldiers<url> and its easy to see why he was so terrified as hitler lost a testicle in the first world war<url> such a trauma it changes a man the thought of chemical weapons likely triggered all sorts of ptsd flashbacks >senior russian officials may be intensifying their attempts to frame and justify russias long term war effort in ukraine as an existential geopolitical confrontation with the west by explicitly equating the us with the nazis yawn >russian opposition sources suggested that widespread internet outages in russia on january <number> may be the result of russian efforts to establish the sovereign internet system the kremlin didnt just decide to flick the internet off on a whim they changed their dns information meaning the downtime was likely how long it took for the change to populate either way this is probably the most significant story in the isws entire article because it means the russian internet now flows through a kremlin controlled dns server putin looked at the modem he looked at the firewall and spread his cheeks wide to human centipede himself between the two wonderful this will grant the kremlin absolute control over public discourse the power behind this sort of thing cannot be overstated by deciding who is allowed to connect to the internet putin is deciding whether someone exists entire regions can find themselves cutoff from the outside world with a keystroke vpns become useless as all outside communication must route through the kremlins dns server they catch dissidents before they even get out the door with this one change the kremlin has seized absolute control over russian communications you guys remember all those videos of muscovites complaining about their burst pipes yeah that sort of thing is about to become super uncommonnot because it isnt happening rather we just wont hear about it >the kremlin has been intensifying efforts to consolidate control over the russian information space in advance of the

it wants to or not apparently >russian authorities are planning to increase the deportation of ukrainian children to russia in <number> donetsk peoples republic dnr council deputy alla barkhatnova

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> today will be slightly abridged as my roommate has a new dog and i want to go pet it please remember that i know nothing correction<url> >thats not how dns works traffic doesnt route through a dns server its only used for domain lookups when sites are black holed via dns it is far easier to bypass than if they were blocked with a firewall you dont even need a vpn all you have to do is point your system to a different dns server and there are plenty of free ones out there this ones more of some personal accountability yesterday i mentioned putin had probably begun to enforce the kremlin as russias defacto dns provider hence the shutdown my phrasing grossly oversimplified the process to the point of being functionally incorrect i use that word functionally because i believe the form is the same that being putins absolute control over the russian peoples communications urechlin raised several important points<url> and challenged me on several leaps i hadnt realized id made for their contribution in fact checking my ass i award them the lone star white hat flair may they wear it with pride ukraine<url> >ukrainian forces struck russian targets in the vicinity of belbek airfield in occupied sevastopol crimea on january <number> hahahahaha oh lord yeah so at this rate i dont think russias going to have much of an air force come spring no damage has been confirmed but ive seen rumors that ukraine nabbed upwards of three sus in this attack its a smack upside the head thats for certain and it follows in ukraines overarching effort to pave the way for the fs however that whole thing shakes out russia claimed ukraine fired off upwards of twenty missiles they also claimed they were storm shadow whatever the fuck that means storm shadows are expensive and i doubt ukraine would fire off twenty of the things for three jets sure its <number> <number> on cost but thats still not a favorable exchange in ukraines favor not when one of those missiles could just as easily pull of a <number> a lot on so either the kremlin is lying about the number maybe or the kremlin is lying about the weapon likely and if it wasnt storm shadows and if it wasnt drones then what the fuck was it honestly it could be anything just fucking anything<url> >ukrainian and russian forces conducted a prisonerofwar pow exchange on

kupyansk to krynky and in an almost desperate swarmlike mentality looks like putins biting at that west is weak narrative thats been dangling above our heads these last few weeks hes got his mouth around it lets hope its center is a hook >estonian defense forces commander general martin herem stated that russia may be behind recent gps jamming in the baltic region russian federation is apparently testing something and are using europes gps network as a testbed for their experiments its perhaps the loudest secret project ive ever seen developed but i will admit that its a secret

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> witness the puppy<url> dudes a rescue so hes a little nervous but hes already settling in please remember that i know nothing ukraine<url> howdy folks lets get to it >ukrainian forces successfully struck and sunk a russian black sea fleet bsf vessel in the black sea near occupied crimea on the night of january <number> to february <number><url> holy fucking shit where the hell did that come from but it makes sense right if south crimea is strikable why here<url><number>zdata=mmsxcfaxfbbdfbemddsfmfxcentry=ttu too what the fuck was the kremlin thinking leaving such an expensive piece of military hardware on the west coast of crimea was this supposed to support assaults on krynky they have to be insane with this strike ukraine just demonstrated they have the entire western half of the peninsula under fire control like sure theyre probably munition limited but then it just becomes a question of optimizing target value so what did the kremlin lose well a boat an expensive boat its fortyman missile corvette meaning it was one of the things shooting missiles at ukrainian hospitals it was also one of the last significant threats towards black sea shipping its loss will likely bring insurance premiums down for ukrainian grain exports odessa might actually make a profit this year russia says ukraine shot a dozen storm shadows to take the boat down crimean air defense claimed they knocked down all of them all of them but one apparently >the milblogger claimed that russian forces downed five missiles near belbek air base in occupied sevastopol and six missiles over yana kapu hvardiske and northwest of sevastopol and that one missile struck the ground near belbek air base but did not damage it look i dont want to tell the kremlin how to do its job but why are missiles fired at a boat in a harbor on the northwest overflying belbek air base<url><number>zentry=ttu striking both the corvette and the air base would be ballsy play not one i would expect ukraine to use with its limited storm shadow supply theyve only got forty<url> of these things and if what the kremlin is saying is true it isnt then over the last two days ukraine has launched thirtytwo of them there aremany contradictions in the kremlins story but if im inclined to humor them then i would pay attention to the numbers notice they didnt say drones the milblogger claimed missiles so how the hell is ukraine firing off twelve storm shadow missile salvos juryrigged sus carry one max two at a time meaning ukraine would have to field minimum a wing of six to meet the numbers this milblogger is claiming fs dont carry them by the way so thats out assuming theyre not some genericass airtosurface missile the kremlin is confusing for storm shadows which leaves glsdb<url> as ufranknarf mentioned yesterday<url> these puppies are typically fired from a himars<url> launcher with a <number> km rangekey word being typically its a pain in the ass but technically they can be fired from the ammunition pod itself this means it can be shipped moved as it were my thought is ukraine fired these sons of bitches off from their oil rigs around odessa<url> sure it still doesnt explain how the missiles made it to belbek but its a damn sight better than the hogwash the kremlin is trying to sell >ukrainian commanderinchief general valerii zaluzhnyi presented an overarching strategy to seize the theaterwide initiative in ukraine and retain it to facilitate ukrainian battlefield victories despite russias numerical advantages in manpower and materiel zaluzhnyis strategy aims to offset ukraines existing challenges and pursue advantages over the russian military through widespread technological innovation and adaptation i havent read it will soon but the isws assessment seems to imply that the main problem is a lack of speed its literally the same conundrum we had in world war one the tank horse is too fragile to survive and the infantry are too slow to exploit a breach what do again i havent read it but let me spit ball an idea gunships these drones are getting big now and honestly its about time we try strapping a gatling gun to one of them why go through the whole rigmarole of dropping a grenade when you could instead point and shoot sure recoil would be a bitch but fear not boys and girls uncle sam has a rifle for every occasion<url> the basic strat is suicide drones swoop in for armor gunships mop up infantry and then the ukrainians show up mostly as a formality and ideally carried in palanquins by robots womenshall be brought to them >russian milbloggers continued to voice frustrations about russian forces continued tactical blunders during offensive operations in western donetsk oblast kupyansk aint goin nowhere mother fucker that offensive was doa still ongoing however making slight gains so it is way too soon to call it but you know what im feeling lucky i have seen zero indication the kremlin can improve their offensive capacity im watching the same columns of olivegreen tanks blowing up that i was watching a year and change ago the tactics are damn near identical which is exactly why the milblogger is bitching ukrainian mines forced russian armor into thin columns making them easy targets for presighted artillery the ukrainians took the lessons they learned at the surovikhin line and duplicated them in kupyansk if ukraine with all of its nato intel and toys couldnt breach it why would the incompetent and beleaguered russian federation have a prayer prove me wrong putin prove me wrong<url> >eu high representative for foreign affairs and security policy joseph borrell stated that the european union eu will not be able to send the promised one million shells to ukraine by march

welcome to the peanut gallery<url> your daily dose of unfounded speculation please remember that i know nothing rthenuttyspectacle<url> as a rule i try not to hold to formal rules im a taoist so rigid structure that aint for me like a river i typically follow a predictable path a groove i carve into the land but over time the banks erode the course subtly shifts yes the destination is always the same but the river she is always new that is the essence of the tao maybe probably not actually by calling it the tao i make it not the tao the point is sometimes a name is going to appear above your head i attempt to acknowledge each of them sometimes ill forget and frequently it will take me several days to get around to it deep down in my core is a student putting off doing his homework like for example just forty years ago i got toasted in a hookah lounge in jericho right just stumbling out into the night absolutely shitfaced i should have been back home to study for a chem exambut fuck that noise now the quran frowns on the matter of alcohol but it is still very easy to find especially in hookah bars prohibition has never worked neither federal nor divine and when you mix the two bliss i assume i never could suffer tobacco now what they sold under the table on the other hand thats when i saw her the most beautiful woman i have ever met true she was a bit hairy and her horns were super pointy but there was something about her cloven hooves the sideways shift of her jaw as she chewed a mouthful of hay it was mesmerizing she was my madonna and i stumbled after herbut she was a nervous one and fled into the desert and so i chased my nymph my muse my flighty infatuation for what else is a man to do jericho is not the most hospitable place and its doubly so when youre plastered i soon got lost and come morning i still couldnt find my way home so i set to walking and ill tell you i must have been marching through that desert for a longass time before up ahead through the haze and the heat i saw her my jezebel the traitor who left me to my fate and yetstill i yearned for my love i longed to feel her touch the caress of her warm and insistent tongue i swept her in my arms but before we could become one i heard a horn a triumphant declaration from over the horizon to welcome the dawn i looked and there i saw the city and a puff of smokea puff which heralded the spinning form of uyakikaki cartwheeling through the sky they slammed into the sand smoldered for a bit and took in the scene eventually they raised a single finger and stated thats a goat anyway thats the story of how uyakikaki stopped me from making a horrible mistake in recognition of their deed i award them the joshuas clarion call flair may they wear it with pride dont do ayahuasca kids youll fail your chem tests ukraine<url> >russian president vladimir putin evoked a wide russian social and economic mobilization reminiscent of the soviet unions total mobilization during the second world war during a february <number> speech despite the fact that russia is undertaking a far more gradual but nonetheless effective mobilization of its defense industrial base dib the thing is even the isw recognizes that russia doesnt have anywhere left to go industrially speaking their economy is suffering critical labor shortages and the front is chewing through migrants at an alarming pace forty percent of the rf gdp is going into the war effort is that not mobilization seems like it to me putins problem is that hes a cartel masquerading as a government he is chief oligarch among many oligarchs all of whom get their wealth from appointments granted to them by putin each in one way or another owe their position their very livelihood to putin intrinsically tying their lifestyle to his success it means that if it doesnt give putin a cut then it doesnt exist and more and more lately thats just been the oil sector minimum pensions keep the muscovites calm and everyone else kind of just fends for themselves maybe the government sometimes does something maybe the point is if industry is suffering labor shortages and the front chews people and if another mobilization will only exacerbate this dichotomy what the hell else can putin mobilize five ten more percent of gdp woopie anything more than that and austerity will begin to kick in likely corresponding with a reduction in pensions >russian defense minister sergei shoigu stated on february <number> that russian forces retain the strategic initiative along the entire frontline in ukraine a notable departure from shoigus previous characterization of russian operations as active defense yep and the tone has changed as well russia is trying to sound triumphant which i imagine plays no small part into the impending presidential elections its such a shame they dont have any victories to show for this initiative especially for the strength the kremlin has committed >ukrainian eastern group of forces spokesperson captain ilya yevlash stated that russian forces have concentrated <number> personnel <number> tanks <number> infantry fighting vehicles <number> artillery systems and over <number> mlrs systems in the kupyansk direction and that there is a total of <number> russian personnel in both the kupyansk and lyman directions ukrainian officials and sources reported that russian forces had concentrated roughly <number> personnel in the kupyansk and lyman directions as of october <number> yevlash may have been referring to a geographically smaller sector of the frontline area than the other ukrainian sources heres a thought isw what if shes referring to the same sector of the frontline what if ukraine has killed <number> <number> russians since october what if shes telling us there are only k russians in the lyman direction because the kremlins concentrated everything theyve got in kupyansk what if theyre having trouble replacing their losses maybe due to all the riots out east the world may never know still thats a lot of crap good luck to ukraine in the coming weeks >opensource investigations indicate that russian forces are benefitting from ukraines ammunition shortage and inability to conduct sufficient counterbattery warfare ukrainian ammunition shortages appear to be enabling the russians theyre concentrating artillery again like in bakhmut smashing towns to smithereens before their advance drones are effective close but they often cant travel <number> kms to the artillery in the back line to do that ukraine needs effective volume of fire to chase off any guns that get too close they cant do that with what theyve got at least in the kupyansk direction >russian outlet izvestiya stated on february <number> citing sources within the russian military that the russian ministry of defense mod is forming air defense units as part of assault units to defend russian infantry against ukrainian drones frontline air strikes and shelling waitair defense units as part of assault units the guys that storm the trenches the rat food what the example this outlet gave was driving a sam platform right up to the front line to protect against droneswhich was somehow supposed to accomplish something to be honest i think this is just an excuse to force vks troops without an aa gun to grab a rifle and man a trench its not like ss are just rolling off the factory line and ukraine supposedly lacks an airforce so what are these people even doing nobody dare tell putin this is a terrible idea because its not its a great idea sending skilled sam operators on pointless assaults prior to the arrival of fs is just the sort of can do attitutde that got putin where he is today >ukrainian and canadian officials announced a new coalition to return ukrainian

cool though im not confident about the actual meaning behind much of this prior to swedens accession sweden was already a western country with strong ties and leanings to the us and although this is definitely debatable and im openminded to being wrong i feel that there is not much difference between an ally and a subordinate country the us probably has more influence over ecuador than over brazil and so in a time of need ecuador would be a better goto this is the same with georgia and turkiye the us has more influential capacity over georgia than turkiye so even though turkiye is considered an ally here georgia would be more preferable to rely on to act in the us favor pragmatically then where is the meaning behind defining allies like this useful data would weigh subordinate countries as more usleaning than allies countries like saudi arabia and azerbaijan work with and agree with the us much more than brazil or bulgaria do,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZmwzN0g2T3EzVjFobG9ZU3cwSVcxdFdGVFN5NTFPS1M4aHhJaHBlZmQ2OVpIMWNwNlF2bktxTm0yMUhaSUdRbF94TW5nS0xSRmRWZThDenB1bnl1VUE9PQ==

i dont think any rational despot around the world would look at this war and see it as a sales pitch for unjust invasion of your neighbors russia clearly expected to roll into kiev after a few months and be done by christmas <number> <number> years later they suffered a major and humiliating stalemate will it last probably not it seems that russia has resigned to the long war and has the resources to pick at their eastern borders until victory by christmas <number> i cant imagine there is a single leader in the world who had machinations for their neighbors territory who hasnt looked at this conflict and reevaluated all of their assumptions nobody with perceived weaker neighbors wants to be in russias shoes right now with that said what can we expect from a peace deal not a lot probably other than a lot of lives saved in a perpetually frozen conflict and a demarcated eastern ukraine whether or not we like it the worlds powers have conspired to push us into a nd cold war so that paradigm is here no avoiding it now perhaps at this point a frozen conflict would be work in our favor by allowing us to fully integrate the remains of ukraine into the western sphere and turn it into a west berlin style cultural hub that can exert great influence into russia you can bet luhansk and donetsk wont be exhibiting the same economic boom kiev would some believe that russias victory may be inevitable what ive describe above would be a damn sight more appealing than a total loss for ukraine and may actually hurt russia in the long run more what did they actually get out of this war a warm water port in a perpetually economically starved crimea luhansk and donetsk arent exactly cultural crown jewels of western russia the reputation of their military export industry has been devastated nato boasts two new very dangerous northern flanking members russias status as a military super power is all but evaporated their nuclear arsenal is all that remains of that conventionally they are pretty much over shadowed by the us and china by a large margin,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMjRDUmt0LXdlVWd2QTZkZEVvNnpHbzl2eXpHQlN4WjJLQmxMdklyUTNMblhtYlJoRGlXVEtkSG5RbWR1N194ckN0aG5fcXcxVm5KMXpjZGZWQlZkMkE9PQ==

note you can scroll down a bit for an audio version of this article this report is extremely revealing about how israel has gone about displacing and harming palestinians in the west bank by supporting abetting and providing cover for settler violence israels ethnic cleansing and illegal settlement expansion in the west bank are perhaps the biggest flashpoint in the israelipalestinian conflict so many destructive decisions and beliefs can be tied to it for example israeli leaderships shunning of a peace deal and twostate solution since the status quo leaves it in power and free to expand settlements settlements are so important because they will be extremely hard to uproot in any potential peace deal meaning israel is tightening its grip on this illegally settled land this section really stood out to me >sharon announced what he called israels disengagement from gaza with a plan to remove settlers forcibly if necessary over the next two years the motivations were complex and the subject of considerable debate for sharon at least it appeared to be a tactical move the significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process his senior adviser dov weisglass told haaretz at the time and when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of a palestinian state this shows that even with supposedly peaceseeking actions like removing settlers from gaza israeli leadership sought to cripple the twostate solution israels continued violence and humiliating occupation and subjugation of palestinians as detailed ad nauseum in this report has been the fuel that lifted up groups like hamas and pushed palestinians to seek violent means of resistance in their view israel hasnt been a willing and open partner for peace i strongly recommend that you read this extremely wellreported article,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjYm5HbURkZVZVZUppS2VsNDJtRXIyYnlqOEcxVjBmdjBXNU5GSkNqeFRuWnlQbzZQSUR2aUEtaTFaSy0ycmtSNWlmUFZXTUdrRE5pUU53c2xlTkJ6amc9PQ==
another element that is often ignored in this discussion is how allowing settler extremists to commit violence pogroms expulsions and eventually enter israels highest government positions is extremely bad for israel they are antidemocratic messianic extremists ignoring or underestimating them is what led to rabins death,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjWVBWM3U3ZFgwRnhpakNHRHpwMDlobUkzdG13TjdvdDhsTUY0Rzg3SE9rZjRjV1Fjb3NLZnpKU0dsV3BaaXNvbTE3YzBxb2Y2MUZVb0MwLUo3S2RIVGc9PQ==

very important read that i cant recommend strongly enough the idf has fought the gaza war in an incredibly inhumane and destructive way that goes far beyond reasonable rules of engagement even considering the complicated nature of this kind of combat these accounts reflect what other idf soldiers and many palestinians on the ground have been reporting,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQU2dhbVNKcVRZRkxCdFN6YTJhT05maTVzMmZyd2ZaRmxuYmFVS1YzSDg0UHpycUdsTVR3U3dIUDJ6UjlzMTJGZFU4U3NRa2NQWWU5ekpmaXJNY1NHWUE9PQ==
some highlights from the article > israeli soldiers describe the neartotal absence of firing regulations in the gaza war with troops shooting as they please setting homes ablaze and leaving corpses on the streets all with their commanders permission > several sources described how the ability to shoot without restrictions gave soldiers a way to blow off steam or relieve the dullness of their daily routine people want to experience the event fully s a reservist who served in northern gaza recalled > were here for the hostages but it is clear that the war harms the hostages that was my thought then today it turned out to be true > the six sources all except one of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity recounted how israeli soldiers routinely executed palestinian civilians simply because they entered an area that the military defined as a nogo zone the testimonies paint a picture of a landscape littered with civilian corpses which are left to rot or be eaten by stray animals the army only hides them from view ahead of the arrival of international aid convoys so that images of people in advanced stages of decay dont come out two of the soldiers also testified to a systematic policy of setting palestinian homes on fire after occupying them,r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQWDlWMUEwRmt6ZU9xdUNibTBpVmpVdEx5LTlEalp1SEVubmpFbzZTaEFlTzlObkJjRTFxcDNZYzBEaHd0ODBCOExZZTByZm9PNFlNdjBhMF9pZzhsd1E9PQ==
