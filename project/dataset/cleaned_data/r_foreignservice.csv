there are four months between the september and january classes realistically what will really change in your life in that timeframe if something will changebe different how meaningful will it be in the long run if it will be meaningful in the long run can you buy yourself enough time by joining the september class and prioritizing posts on your bid list with lengthy language training congen or other types of longterm training that wont have you leaving the us until after whatever youre waiting to change changes,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeTh6UjFISlA2M3d3cEYyQjU2YlJMOGEyQ0ZjQnVOREFpRmR5ZjlkbDA5TGxFd1o5TFlxNG1jMEVPcUFlM0psTWxQNklXUWJXMVJ5ZEtBWmF2MVFDWHc9PQ==

this is good advice but i would add that declining for personal reasons does not mean that you dont have your heart set on it i know thats not what youre implying but just wanted to highlight that its a very personal decision you have a lot to weigh whatever choice you make will be the right one given your priorities at the moment regardless of how badly you want this job,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYVNsZEZQWlg2enFKQWRsLUdXbE9ZU0NBUlJCaVJ2MDB6VGdjRWZkZUxTMGM2SkM5OGJ6VmVTX2lfWXFfRldwZkY4ckozQW5Cd1ZLSWhTVTBXM214UmtMV1BEN0pLS1Jra1ZETk9MeWVPeEk9

on the dss register here waiting on a class date with a <number> yes im rebexing ive heard this sentiment a lot and i get it however its a different thing when youre balancing other life responsibilities before you get in not wanting to fuck over your current responsibilities with how you exit your current role maybe youre finishing a degree or maybe youre even on military orders reservists can hop on and off we already have to put our life on hold to pursue this process i think this becomes very different once the foreign service is part of your life is your responsibilities and is paying your bills i for one have intentionally set my life up for the application process and being able to drop things on a dime to go when called and i partially regret it im on the register and will absolutely take the first opportunity i have to go to a class but the nearly <number> years of waiting and working a stagnant job feel like wasted time i feel like ive been in purgatory waiting on the beckoning call of an agency im not yet a part of which again i get it im not unique in that and its a taste of whats to come i just think its unreasonable for people not in yet to do that because a lot of people dont have the ability to set their life up that way but what do i know still on the outside looking in waiting to start the journey hope this doesnt come off as spiteful i just think salty and experienced folks like yourself forget what its like to be in the hiring purgatory or maybe im just off base all together and am venting my frustration,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYN1NGYVFIa1lkc2lmVl96RFBMYmxpNm1TNnpNQmdDRzJiMUtkbi1oU2tjTkdPOTNGM2M4c3FMZVpPb0E4UnUteGN4dDFYeWJZbVFqRzh6VmxDTC1yNHFZLXJwOE5hSU5Yb2xSUVRqTjFZVjA9

i think people think oh this will somehow get more stable once i am in the fs until you are supposed to pcs in less than a month but you dont have an assignment and you are desperately trying to find a post that will accommodate your familys needs or maybe you wake up to a coup and have to get your family out of the country on zero notice but you are staying behind to manage the crisis sure there may be a big specific thing in your life but in my experience many of the people who have thrown out vague statements like personal reasons have privately told me it would just be so quick to sell my house and pack everything up with only three months notice if thats the only hangup then i have bad news about what the fs holds for you and you are deluding yourself if you think it gets much easier once you are in the departments is an administrative shit show every pcs is like the first time it has ever happened your orders will be wrong a panel will have forgotten to review your packet your orders wont be funded until two days prior to departure so thats when you will be allowed to finally pack out i stand by what i said if a lack of certainty and planning are something that you cannot live with and thats fine then you should reevaluate the fs because that isnt going away and it isnt going to get much better but what do i know,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc2VRSzVBOUkyZ0JENHYzTW8tQ1lzakJod2tvSzJWbThOYTJ5cGRXSVBZSkhBNl9rSHF1WUF4UnFxSnVwNk03WEZsNXlSODVFWWF4bkJLbkVNVGJXT0E9PQ==

thank you for sharing your perspective and experiences im not delusional in my thought process and nothing i said comes from a place of authority just my observations with myself and others i know still grinding for a class seat the distinction i draw between the application process and active fs is that the application process has unique frustrations and unpredictability of being a transitional phase for example over the past two years ive willingly passed on opportunities due to being in the application process these included a yearlong activation to italy pursuing a seat at the basic reconnaissance course advancing my education with a masters degree and taking a new job only to have my position stagnated when my security investigator showed up indicating to my manager that i might leave soon for a government role now it feels challenging to engage in meaningful career advancements within the limited time frame available many in my hiring cohort share similar sentiments feeling stuck and unable to progress due to the uncertainties of the application process being in your mid to late s and having that as an albatross while you watch people around you progress their careers while the ds instagram post your dream job every week is disheartening to say the least,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbTB4bzJBVG9LSzZqVDRFN0NMZUFWMmdyWkVSN3RTQ05zc09UX0ZjelB6UWZOdThvMGlYUDNKTHAxWnMxZFJlY2VWODB4VzlPa3BTN2lGcFgzUlY0cTVHMldsLWZyaWdhLVVyUGE0eHJVOG89

not as an fs generalist candidate you have no need for access to sci products as someone on the register or even for many assignments as a generalist and thus state will not support sci adjudications until you have an fs assignment where you have regular need for access to sci products or work there are some specialist skill codes that are investigated for ts with sci at the same time as its expected theyll need that access to do mostall assignments in that skill code furthermore you dont actually have a clearance until youre sworn in on day one of a<number> until then the best you can say is that youve been positively adjudicated for a ts clearance once your clearance investigation is done and adjudicated,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaalBpNDJtcDJWSHdCT0N1N1YyNlZGQ29UaHFlUXBwREV5S3lOTWM4OTR2Qm5maFNIMGNlclk5RWxhS2ZWZ1VTR3pjSHAwZ1BMcUhweXRHMXhjVnZUYXc9PQ==

ive heard of people being asked if they wanted to switch to mgmt but i dont think you can just wake up one day and decide you want to be in a new cone you also have to think about if you really want to do the job that you want to switch to in order to get in because what would be the point of taking a job that you arent interested in just to get in and be miserable in that job,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUGNFVkRLVGNVRXIyZllBQmlpVXVSTkNJUnBfWl94WEpRd0NnVV95SXREMlhSejUwbWNJaXBQTHNzTEYyM3owQjB0UVNCVWRaQUg4eUdCVEN6YUR3VTR1ODY4V0dCaUdUMzN5WUpFWDA1ZVk9

slim to none state recently offered some people with lower scores on other registers the opportunity to be considered for mgt offers since that register was basically depleted even then theyd deplete everyone on the mgt register before offering invitations to anyone on other registers and it doesnt appear theyve actually made any of those offers yet that appears to be a oneoff effort and not something you can at all count on you also need to be completely on board with the other cone youre not going to get hired as a mgt coned officer and then just do pol assignments anyway youll be doing the bulk of your career in your selected cone and its difficult and a long shot to switch cones after youre in given that you really need to be sure youre going to be happy doing the other cone for <number> or more years,r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheXpYb0ZFLV9hUE5jTFJmTjQ0S0pQWHU1S05xRFJQUlQwN3dyQWJyVU44a1lYVXhhVVRMT3Fxb01zbzVRaERBM0piOEQ3R1ZyRE9SaTdjb2ZuWVJLNWc9PQ==
