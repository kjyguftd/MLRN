so if im understanding you correctly the original karst prior to there being soil here would have contained all the minerals that are currently in my soil im not suggesting that the rocks that are still here would disappear with soil production i was just puzzled wondering where the minerals in my soil came from when every rock in the area is calcium carbonate elements dont materialize from no where if all this land ever started with was calcium carbonate then the minerals came in from somewhere else if though the karst iswas a mix of minerals then that gives me a good idea of how the soil could have formed,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZTR1S0JEeFFlZy1RQS01XzhkbnNmUG5oaU1KOHdpWFBJeURDQmZfTnFDa2duZDNTbTV0MW9tZVVxTG5BVjFBUlMwMy1CTE5mc2ZTLUFGSXhWaTJpc1E9PQ==

its something thats affected by gravity rather than just being a smooth nonlumpy surface there are slight differences in gravity at different points on the crust based on density of nearby features in particular if you dug a canal at sea level from the coast to denver the water would be higher there than it should be because the surrounding mountains would be pulling on it more than the flat land at the coast the difference amounts to a few feet of water level and thats been factored into the height of the mountains,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYm8wSkkwNHVMZl9waFZKU20ycWc3eS0xV1V5S2QtZ3dpLU95N1FpbzhMM0hIX0ZRb1lESjlfM2JZblhaOGtCNVprVXh2RWVlVk1PVFlHb0hiSGJaOWl1RHNPN2p3bDh0MmVHZC0zN2w4Q289

i believe the rate of soil development over limestone is very slow in areas with high moisture climates it may be more rapid but generally experience a major net loss of mass due to chemical weathering leaving behind only the impurities in the limestone many areas like florida and the bahamas which are situated on carbonate reef platforms gain a majority of soil from dust transported off africa via trade winds,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUi1PaFFxdThLLUVTRVpLRnJaTUY4SzBPZlN1dWJHQ1FFcnVzbDI5X0JoaEtZSm1IczQyNWxKTW9xaklSemRjd3JRLUhjeS1yYWZ0UlVGLTFfQ1FRWEZ0VUpnbUxWWUdfbERnWE9UODRoLUE9

youre probably looking at flood or debris flow deposits from a stream there was enough water rushing through the stream during a flood to transport gravel it looks like there is some normal grading in these layers the gravel gets smaller as you go up and gives way to sand this is because the waning flood drops larger stones first while smaller grains are still moving there are two gravel layers so those are probably from two separate events a lot of the rock fragments look angular rather than rounded so they werent carried very far from their source dry areas are prone to this kind of thing rainfall often comes in sudden downpours and the lack of vegetation means much of it runs off and there is little to stop erosion,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTTZwZjhkX1dKZEhpaFRyNFI3bHRVOFMybWY3aHNBTm44bWZFZ3YzOTMzSjlYSnVfWWM0ZktnRXJjMHF6Y1NRTzNTRGg1VFhVRTJJaE5vTnQ4azF2R1E9PQ==

there are certain measurable physical properties that we can test to identify a mineral before i list them it is imperative that you know this color is never an identifying property however a minerals habit or the shape it grows is similarly the shape it breaks into is also helpful for your question hardness is probably the easiest test glass has a hardness of about <number> and quartz is <number> if you cant scratch quartz with it you know its less than <number>,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbERkMmdqUXJlazBUR0k3VjM3QXNIdXRTNmczVjhDeW1OdE9CQjc3dHVQUlFKWEFrcldKLUd1d2EycGdpTzl4WWxQRU5YY1pWbTRVN3JBblVVV3czN2c9PQ==

assuming the mineral is identified by the seller it is usually easiest if you have seen the natural mineral before however this isnt always possible some red flags that may help that come from appearance or handling alone are that the mineral seems to have no natural flaws or inclusions within the crystal structure you may see air bubbles inclusions tiny fractures the colour of the crystal may also be too evenly distributed whereas the natural crystal would have colour gradients the fake crystal may also be too lightweight because its made out of lighter material crystals that are fake or synthetically colored may also appear unnaturally vibrant a natural crystal should feel cool in temperature in your hand whereas a fake could be made from a material that adapts to room temperature overall if a mineral looks too perfect or uniform that can be another giveaway even beautiful natural crystals have some irregularities an example of a mineral that is often fake is malachite i have lots of natural malachite in my home so i know what to look for a giveaway for malachite is that the banded lines are too sharp theres no gradient between them too uniform sometimes black malachite does not have black bands malachite can also forms with chrysocolla which is a light greenish blue to blue that i havent yet seen on fakes overall the malachite patterns can be very complex and hard to replicate on fakes so if you look closely it should be easy to tell,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOS1uWmc0dHNuWmxnRTVsSlZhLS1yMV95REI4WVJxTjRqLTBKdXlNWHVISUJPU0gzNmRweGgyZ254azNHdnpockJYZTZIUGhJVU1XdXNxbnc1NzV0S2c9PQ==

i wouldnt speak of evolution when it comes to minerals in my mind minerals are the organized way that the elements arrange themselves the number of possible mineral structure although a huge number is finite as it is finite the number of stable elements the presence of a specific mineral structure doesnt depend on time if you have the right p t and x conditions the atoms will form a specific structure but if the conditions are met at t or at t it doesnt make any difference so maybe you could tell that specific structures werent possible before because there werent the right conditions but the structure itself didnt need time to evolve hope it is clear,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcFlGSl9pZ3Q5WmJkU3k4Zy15TzdNV1h3RnpVblgzX0lEMDBGeDRTRm00TDh3UFpwR0lSZ0ZDaHc5ZFVzd21SLVZwQ29kUnRuNHJ3Zy1DQ0pDak93M3c9PQ==

i agree with both comments rifts and plate separations are caused by the rising areas of convection cells in the deeper mantle coming up to the earths crust melting through it in some places to form volcanoes but also spreading away on either side causing the crust to start to separate one of the big discoveries early on before plate tectonics was fully developed and accepted was the realization that on either side of a midocean ridge or rift valley the volcanoes and volcanic rocks get progressively older with the volcanoes becoming inactive by contrast here in colorado we find the oldest rocks in the very center of the mountains with the rocks on either side getting progressively younger this is due to uplift pushing deep very old igneous and metamorphic rock to the surface pushing the younger rock above away to either side the african plate currently shows very little movement which is thought to indicate it might be prime for multiple breakups the african plate could shatter into numerous smaller plates eventually the hawaiian islands are over individual hot spots in the mantle that form volcanoes on the crustal plate above convection currents are keeping the pacific plate moving generally northishwestwards and as the plate moves the volcanoes and the islands formed with them that form over the hot spot are moved away eventually becoming extinct and growing progressively smaller due to weathering the farther they shift from the hot spot even farther away the volcanic islands become seamounts below the oceans surface,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ2kxSHhMdE81d0FTbWp6MV9TOVVrVnNBRnFfX19NZG9ia0xpYlFmV3RSS2Q3c0syQk9wUVdQcnpXNW1mZ2hDc1FMTV8xVkc0SlBCZDRQODBKOHM5d0E9PQ==

yep mountains are some of the most poorly preserved environments in the geologic record there are remnants of ancient once mighty mountain belts that probably rivalled the himalayas eg the appalachians of n america or the caledonides aka scottish highlands but the majority of rock that made them up and thus the record of environments that those mountains once contained have largely been eroded and formed into new rock elsewhere a lot of the bits that remain represent the core of the original mountain ranges which is why they are often igneous metamorphic these are thee kinds of rock make up the crystalline basement and get uplifted during mountain building in some ways the best rock record of mountain belts can actually be the sequences of sedimentary rock that form in sedimentary basins adjacent to the mountains often in a marine environment this kind of rock<url> is a good example of what i mean,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaM2N1R2RIUV9CdmJSdFMyd0hicG9KZWdjNmdTV182RWlxdkZMd2N5UXA4U3o1ZXMxeXQ1eklvWjAzYVBaTGZkQkEzemlqcnlzUU14YnV4cVpubW5POUwxdHlMVXNEX1hZcjh6VFNNaERXTGc9

minerals dont evolve the way life evolves it sounds like figurative language it sounds like they are trying to say the conditions that control the growth of minerals has changed over the life of earth in a nutshell there are three big factors that lead to the growth of different minerals chemical ingredients temperature and pressure obviously the temperature of the earth has changed drastically in the last <number> billion years or so the same goes for pressure and chemistry so you can claim that certain minerals could only form early in the life of earth that can no longer form today one great example is the transition from banded iron formation to limestone as dominant mineral formations that precipitate from the ocean before life started pumping out oxygen into the atmosphere iron would form chemically in the ocean once oxygen levels got high enough limestone started to form instead its easy to anthropomorphize natural processes like this but it is not evolution simply put the conditions that form certain minerals only exist at certain points in the earths history so the set of minerals which can form at a given time changes too minerals do not pass heritable traits from generation to generation minerals come from large chemical soups not mommy and daddy minerals,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTNsTThiMWIzUEFVRC1ncF9ZUlFsdGd1WmRkVHlzM1JFUTRzUVQ5WE5LdmpYY3dmWkpVNmdiWUlOTWExSW9PT1J0b3ZsVm9LRzk5VjdaZ1Z6VC1QbkE9PQ==

halite is a naturallyoccurring mineral that has the same chemical composition as the noniodized stuff in your salt shaker nacl one sodium one chlorine nacl is an ionic bond which if you recall from chem class means its formed by a couple of charged have more or fewer electrons than protons particles which bind together to make a net neutral compound for halite its an na+ one fewer electron and a cl one extra electron bonding together to make a net zero charge molecule nacl halite and also sylvite kcl that someone else mentioned are evaporites meaning they can form when a body of water evaporates that contains sodium or potassium for sylvite and chlorine ions these ionicallybonded molecules are water soluble meaning when you dump salt in water and give it a stir you dont just end up with a bunch of nacl rattling around in your glass you also get na+ and cl ions floating around because the water molecules are polar and have a positive and a negative pole which acts to weaken the electrostatic forces that bond the ions causing them to dissociate all this really broadbrush and a chemist would likely pick me apart here info is to give you a sense of the relative simplicity of the mineral halite and most evaporites and ionicallybonded compounds they are water soluble because ho is polar and can cause them to dissociate so if youre thinking about the degree of magically rigorous or complicated or however things work in your world relative to the degree of how hard it is to disassemble and reassemble these compounds you can do it with a glass of water and some sunshine respectively source im a geologist and also a fantasyddetc dork i love questions like this,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQ2JfaWI1NnJ3LThZQ20yNHk5akJzMm9jWnRxSUd3eUlWLWFzOEJRZzBIVllCRkNIQ1pKdXE0WEZPRzFrTnJMN1gtdE5vcEw3bUZLc3dhY0phQVhuT3c9PQ==

this is called jointing as the rock erodes from an outcrop it fails along the physical shape of the underlying lattice ie at microscopic scales the rock is stronger in one direction then other so it fails along the weaker plane creating a flat edge the glacial idea is wrong because to see such clear flattening from being dragged by a glacier we would expect parrael striations on the flat face,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaM2tyem5PWXZmclBORTJ6RkltbUpJM1B3WjFpUm9idDBPRko2Ukl6N2wtSFFMbHhUOFFsd1RSNVUzaENUMXlPaXZVVzJqdDRROXVITDhRNzFmWXpEV0E9PQ==

best way to learn geology is to learn about landscapes and the rock cycle the rest falls into place within this mental framework alot better ie learn about what the most likely scenario is based on the geologic setting of the area if you found thos where there have never been glaciers you know you are not going to consider glacial erratics as a source,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXIyTXZkaUtuandabnZ4azltSWJmVHl0QnZsTW1JSDFEWFp1b29ZODlZWUpVTDduRW5GZ085SHhWVWYtWHg0U1NEM1hJWnEybXdLUllHSVIzWF8ydmc9PQ==

there is literally nothing perfect about the top surface with the angle not anything else perfect about this rock look at it objectively put an actual manmade straight object like a ruler against the surface and compare the level of perfection all loose rocks like this we call them clasts and they range from boulder and cobble size on the large end of the scale like this rock down to sand silt and mud particles on the small end originated from a larger outcropping mass of rock and were broken off by weathering erosion and then transported some distance sometimes hundreds of kilometers from the outcrop source when such clasts break off of an outcrop they can form in millions of different basically random shapes depending on a variety of factorsthe shape of the outcrop the crystalline structure of the rock itself structured within the rock andor outcrop the method of erosion degree of weathering location climate etc etc out of all of those possible shapes of clasts many are guaranteed by the laws of probability to have some faces or edges that are relatively flat compared to others on top of this natural distribution and occurrence of the shapes of rocks that includes rocks with flatish surfaces specific structures such as faults and mineral veins in the rock andor mineral outcrop as well as alignment of crystals in the rock and diagenetic formed with the rock features such as bedding planes and erosional features like unconformities in sedimentary rocks not this one which is a granitic rocka plutonic igneous rock with randomlyaligned mostly equigranularmeaning about all the same size and shapecrystals can by themselves or together combined create planes of weakness in the rock or otherwise discrepancies in composition that cause flatish surfaces to form after the rock has been subjected to erosion side note not to op directly there has definitely been a noticeable uptick in how was this rock not made by humans posts here although it has always been a common question from people not familiar with geology i attribute such an uptick to the zeitgeist and current popular obsession with ancient aliens and atlantean civilizations popularized by charlatans like graham hancock and numerous tiktok conspiracy theory influencers,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelItYWdOTU01ZUZQd0VhUmM3dlVzM003ZVpISzhIaFpUMFNMaUxNYzhOdzVMVjFQVEhPTk5LTFQ3VXdlVnIwMkdHTHZ1UXFnVmFfLUtXb3drRU5VaGc9PQ==

the thickness of a deposit is a very poor indicator of how long it took to form sedimentation rates in different places are vastly different for example a landslide might deposit tens of meters of material in a few seconds while in a low energy lake or ocean system sediment might only accumulate at fractions of a millimetre per year add on to that the fact that somewhere which has deposition going on for a while can have big erosive events then strip out loads of that deposited sediment think about shallow water twhen a storm happens and the geolgoical record is much more complicated than just a steady accumulation of sediment when we date rocks we are often using totally different techniques like radiometric dating for metamorphic and igneous materials which allow us to date when the crystals formed or using the occurrance of particular fossils to provide dates for sedimentary rocks theres lots and lots of different techniues we can use in different settings and using lots of them in combination gives us a very robust dating system across the planet as to climate yes understanding climate is important and very useful rocks often tell us a lot about the environment they were deposited in and that can help us understand lots about what the planet was like at a given time and how the environments changed through time it is a big control on how much water is in a system and the types of erosion processes and depositional environments that were active at a given place at a given time,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaUN5a0l5WTBMakgxdVBBQl9mZHZZQjVLcUpNa2dKbzNxNkk5dXNUYTg0NEs3T2s1LWRJZy1BLV8wRFpjUm1FSEV4bmctaWlCalpWTnpyTVMtVXpkRkE9PQ==
a blood test would tell you whether you got a significant dose but mercury in that form is not considered particularly bioactive methylmercury forms in response to bacterial activity and thats the form of primary toxic concern which accumulates in fish and contaminated solis and sediments i didnt learn much about safety precautions with substance exposures until i entered the environmental consulting field now i routinely use protective equipment in any situation with significantrepeated exposure to dusts solvents agricultural pesticideshebicides potential eye hazards and sustained loud noise i cringe remembering school work handling heavy likely chlorinated oils to determine mineral grain compositions with no personal protective equipment ppe at all those things are significant carcinogens it never surprises me to learn that a professor of mineralogy or biochemistry had died of pancreatic or liver cancer i really hope universities have gotten better about requiring and teaching about ppe use,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMUd5VTByYVZmNWpsX3BuQ3E1dWI2VWE0X2Zub3EwOW1UczZmV2ctRlVhSDFTenFYekxFUTh0eXBheVFGYXVFM2psVGc4bEg3a1pNSTdVZ3lLQVBVUE1YQUFmY21DekNMZXJISUVadEpGcnM9

i used to take college geology students there for field trips the whole area is pretty amazing geologically the red sandstone is part of the fountain formation which also crops up at the garden of the gods in colorado springs roxborough state park and in the flatirons west of boulder it is pennsylvanianpermian in age and i know people who have found permian reptile footprints in that sandstone but fossils are pretty rare the red color tells us that the sand was formed from aeolian deposits above water and was oxidized as mentioned by others the entire region was uplifted during the laramide orogeny you can see excellent crossbedding features in it nearby are some great dinosaur footprints near morrison formed much later during the jurassic period theres an excellent museum near the footprints as well just north of the footprints over the hogback they are on is a road cut that was made when i<number> was first being built in the late <number>s when i was a geology major at ohio wesleyan in the <number>s i took slides of the road cut for my geology professors as it was a pretty big deal then on the very top of the hogback there are also footprints but they are hidden arthur lake a seminary student discovered dinosaur bones at the top of the hogback in <number> and became part of the dinosaur war between othniel marsh and edward drinker cope when boxcars of the dinosaur bones being sent to cope were highjacked by marsh lakes had contacted marsh first but was ignored marsh used that as a pretext to highjack the bones unscrupulous collectors have stolen and damaged footprints which is kind of pointless as the shaley limestone breaks down pretty quickly i have found dinosaur bone fragments in rocky deposits well down below the area later on as a high school science geology instructor i did field trips to red rocks and the surrounding areas great geology teaching opportunities that i continued with community college classes red rocks was once an important camp site for the native american utes as it provided great cover it was later developed as a tourist attraction and was purchased by the city of denver and made into an official denver park in <number> my dad and his friends used to load up their bicycles with gear and camp out there while it was still fairly wild the amphitheater was developed by the wpa during the great depression and held its first concert in <number> it is a great venue and ive seen many favorite artists there i will add a note of caution though although this may be changing due to global warming typically the last week of julyfirst week of august are the two rainiest weeks in colorado the big thompson flood that killed <number> people occurred july <number> <number> when nearly <number> of rain fell in <number> minutes several times despite everything i know ive still bought tickets to shows at red rocks in late july and early august and it has rarely gone well for me or the performers,r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWDN5XzN1c25GY2d1RW9XZ3ZEcThaMG9UYURjSGoxVDZWaS1tNm9GckdMUDdGNThza2hQNTJsZEI4aVhEZDRkd0RZdGlXN18xT0JhbFZPdEJMSzc2T0E9PQ==
