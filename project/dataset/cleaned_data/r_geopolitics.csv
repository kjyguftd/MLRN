i didnt quite understand what you meant with that dagestani example i guess what i was about to say to that particular example is that you would be using dagestani people against russians or vice versa by telling the other side is bad i just cant see myself western countries doing that very easily and obviously it would have to remain secretunofficial maybe we as civil society should be doing that our self and more and citizens can do many of todays propaganda in internet solo actually i believe it is happening more than you think but maybe not in the ways and directions we would hope to i have seen people see russian bots in places where it wouldnt make any sense and at least here in finland i see way too many people using accusations against disagreeing people very easily all the time now for any reason because its so cheap trick to try to say the other is bad because being a russian symphatiser is very bad here now obviously i might think this is on the people themselves to defend against i mean lets look at putin he keeps things under his control maybe it works for him maybe it doesnt regardless people arent any wiser why would we be different even if we would do exactly like putin control is going to obviously lean on who people vote and with a very high risk its going to cause more problems because someone is going to pissed always so i think if people care at least civil society should start using the attack animation on putin and not on ourselves,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNmxORnNkd2JxYjhzS0J0VWtUbTZWOWJMdG1JNWlIVWQ0bDhJYWRMMVlGWVE1SnF5MDFER2I5UTNvcUZrbFFLdjVkb0lsMTM3c3RZX2FGckN2RE9RWGJVcHpuaWptNFZZUVRRakVyMDNwbFU9

you misunderstand economic reliance on russia its not simply about trade belarus is poor and can hardly finance anything in terms of infrastructure projects of any significant size thus they are always begging russia for loans and sometimes in the past they even went west for economic assistance but begging russia for loans comes at a cost usually at the cost of belarusian sovereignty look up the deep integration so lukashenka would much much prefer to have other places besides russia giving him loans because they are far less likely to damage his own position prior to the war he really tried to get chinese goods to cross belarus on their way to europe as a source of income but the war changed that and china realised shipping across russia and belarus to the huge eu market was too risky at least for now and they have backed off lukashenko has continually tried to make deals with china and he has also wanted to cooperate in military matters as well,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQjY0dl9fdXBTdkcxSkJfMm5VQVh0d2YyXzQ4U1hObmUzeGM0TUtoR2dfSDNBbEtVZng4SmNpWWVpdG94cnpzYVYwWEp0WW9acGNKWXhxV0Rkb2N6Z1E9PQ==

the thing about russian propaganda that most people dont understand is that most of it has nothing at all to do with russia the stuff that does have to do with russia is what people can notice easily so its all they focus on but its only the tip of the iceberg russia is behind a lot of the political division in the west they do anything they can to make that worse a lot of their stuff is wholly focused on the domestic political issues of the countries they are working in they also have lots of different channels of dissemination media figures politicians actors academic figures influencers religious leaders they have many different people all disseminating the same stuff from different sources some of them are probably knowing intelligence assets for the russian government for one reason or another others may just be fed propaganda through targeted campaigns where they introduce spies to someone and just talk them up or they fill their social media feeds with posts designed to influence their thinking the end result is a lot of people amplifying narratives that ultimately come from the kremlin while having no idea that this is the case i think an important aspect of it is the demoralization they are trying to paint a picture of the world as being broken and corrupt and ruled by conspiracies which ironically makes the society more susceptible to becoming corrupt and ruled by conspiracies it is a self fulfilling prophecy corrupt countries lead by authoritarian strong men and an oligarchic political class of elites are countries that russia can deal with have you noticed all the people on the internet on places like chan who seem to be completely out of touch with reality and living in an alternate universe well that didnt just come out of nowhere much of it is attributable to our own domestic media which on the right has largely lost all scruples and operates with an intent to deceive people at worst and simply feed them whatever bullshit theyre asking for at best but not all of it some of it comes down to the propaganda coming out of russia it is the exact same playbook that putin used originally when he took power remember that putin moved to take control over the media from the oligarchs earlier than he moved on the fossil fuel oligarchs so even above the money needed to fund his government he prioritized media control the media in russia is sort of similar to how fox news operates except every news station is fox and theyre all controlled by putin and any variation in ideological flavor from station to station is actually just for entertainment purposes and ultimately they all send the message that putin wants to send to people because the same message comes from many differing sources people tend to believe it they pay attention to the hotbutton issues but ultimately these are not what the kremlin cares about the hotbutton issues are just there to get peoples attention they dont affect anything important from the kremlins point of view the important stuff is slipped in without people even noticing the basic framework of thinking assumptions about how the world works all of this can be manipulated over time to control people and this is how putin has gained control of his own country now this model is being applied increasingly to the west i think the important thing to realize is that putin is looking to influence democracies by gaining control over their politics via the democratic process they need allies to do this and they have found them they are influencing the domestic politics of democracies with the goal of promoting the candidates and parties that will be most ideologically aligned with them there was a clear quid pro quo with the first presidential campaign of donald trump he sought help from the russians he received help from the russians as did other members of the republican party and he gave the russians what they wanted by altering the party platform to be against ukraine aid this was the one and only change trump requested for the entire platform he literally just rolled over the exact same platform but the one thing he supposedly cared about was stopping ukraine aid you want me to believe he did that just because hes super concerned about ukraine no he did that because he knew the russians were helping him and he needed to help them back the same dynamic is happening in europe anti immigrant sentiment is being amplifed by the russians both in the us and europe and in both cases russia is actively trying to make the problem worse by sending more migrants to these countries remember the migrant caravan that was a thing in the us presidential election that was traced back to a russian disinformation campaign where they were telling people all sorts of lies to entice them to go they organized it on the ground with internet campaigns leading to real life migrant caravans forming which was then used by the media to attack the democrats similar stuff has happened in europe with the syrian situation russia has been purposefully flooding europe with muslim migrants and then flooding those countries with anti muslim propaganda which they then use as a tool to gain support for the candidates that are friendly to them i think this current political moment can best be understood as an attempt by certain members of the far right in western democracies to try and russify their countries that is to say to implement their system of oligarchic control and guided democracy with strongmen leaders who rule over the populous using propaganda the nra in the us was clearly coordinating their propaganda with russia and there were russian spies caught red handed in their organization trump attempted a coup and now the supreme court has started handing down nakedly political rulings that effectively legislate from the bench and have started to take away rights people once had this is really a much bigger issue than most people understand russia is looking to destroy western democracies and far right politicians in those countries are gladly willing to help them do it if it allows them to steal even more wealth and power for themselves,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac0U5cjlwaG93OHB2bjkxQ2U5RlQ0MWRQMWpFLU1JUzI2bnRsSWFCVGZudDNUUGVwMjBsUVZhcWRhRGF2b0psb0pfc0lWR1pKTF9CdThpdE9GYk51NXc9PQ==

the qing dynasty was indeed a manchurian dynasty meaning it was not a han ethnic dynasty even sun yatsen who was pushing for the republican revolution in the s considered the manchu barbarians however internationally the qing dynasty was considered the chinese empire regardless of if the manchus or tartars as you can find in old texts ruled over them since countries are ultimately a legal fiction and there is no jurisdiction higher than a country to enforce what isisnt a legal country the closest thing we get to defining what a country is and isnt is what other countries legally think that country isisnt other countries considered the manchu qing dynasty the chinese empire so it was the chinese empire when the republic of china overthrew the qing dynasty other countries recognised the republic of china as the successor china meaning the republic of china inherited all legal financial debts treaties and territories of the qing dynasty when the peoples republic of china took over the mainland the soviets and the eastern bloc recognised the prc as the successor chinese state while the us and the western bloc did not eventually though the western bloc and almost all of the nations in the un recognised the communist prc as the legal chinese state inheriting all the legal obligations and territories of the roc and therefore the legal obligations and territories of the qing dynasty this is why in the s margaret thatcher had to negotiate with the prc over the expiring <number> year hong kong extended territory lease a treaty they signed with the qing dynasty since all countries have legally considered tibet a part of the chinese empire consider the republic of china the successor of the chinese empire and the peoples republic of china the successor of the republic of china tibet is a part of china for now for better or for worse compare and contrast with taiwan which is de jure part of china but de facto independent and also outer mongolia which china had claims to but acknowledged mongolias independence in exchange for soviet technical and industrial assistance in the s and therefore no china no longer has legal claim over,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaUg0V250MEEwd016NE5wOGx1bms2Sld1eEhPdmItODdhdklBM1E5SGhtVGxLakFERjE2d2hyZUdwQnNWYnFhQWhEMjQ4Ml9TZlMzSTVDeUsyYXBYZlE9PQ==

it was never about defending ukraine at all costs it was always about entrenching the divide in the middle of europe making the war appear something symbolically significant that all of us must actively participate in against the great looming threat in the east its one thing to proclaim how this war is a matter of life or death how putin is the new genocidal hitler and how this must affect absolutely everyone in order to rile up the public and push everyone firmly in their potholes in the western bloc because the politicians must appeal to the public in the middle of the election cycle and another thing to actually take decisive action that would truly answer the russian resolve its optics mostly at a point where the situation would drastically escalate the major western powers at the forefront in defining the western response would lose their firm control of the situation and that control would be outsourced to the troops on the ground their leadership and to the hands of the two participants of the war when ukraine starts pushing beyond russian borders with their massive amounts of armaments they are calling the shots and what could the west do about it stab them in the back or when russian response is a new mass invasion with literally everything they have under total mobilization and strategic bombings they are calling the shots and again what could the west do start an all out great war against them in the end its all just a calculated and choreographic chess game where both sides the west usa and russia make their own moves wait for the other to make theirs and figure out a new move they evaluate the outcomes and make a move that has the least risk of getting out of hand but reaps the most benefit and retains ones control the moves mostly involve diplomacy deals soft power and extremely limited hard power with strict limitations keep in mind sooner or later probably during this year we will see a bold chess move from somewhere in the west that bites the bullet and concludes that they wont be supporting ukraine anymore this will most likely happen under the pretense of ukraine having done something wrong like a sudden war crime with western weapons aka collateral damage in an attack on a military asset or just singled out war crime done by one rogue unit or supposedly breaking the restrictions imposed on them by not attacking deep within russia or just supposedly stealing some of the aid or selling the weapons in the black market in order to lessen the pr impact to any western leader who first suggests it i can see something like the fox news or some other tabloid garbage clinging on to a story of civilian casualties in a ukrainian attack that reaches other outlets as well and a major audience and once enough <number> iq people are ragebaited into yelling how ukrainians are no different than russians and this is how their tax money is used some politician will break the silence with his bold strong words of questioning the ukrainian resolve and endorsing peace negotiations or ceasefire on the condition of not sending any more support to ukraine,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY20zNzhhMWhLUzNnN2pBLVdDZEVybFV2MHUyd3Vqc0Fyei1WNElLeGtYQXltZFlfSHZ2NEhIdzB0VElVN3VYcXY3ZVhPTW9NSWpDMkI5VUY5VTdiVDZ6T2RtbGZUZUlUbTk1VWx3TkJXMW89

the short answer is in the type of scenario youre presenting it really ultimately doesnt matter how or what the unsc or un votes upon what does matter is if there are countries with the capability and willingness to do something about it that probably sounds like a barbaric statement to some but at some point the only thing thats going to counter an act of force is another act of force you can go back to the iraqi invasion of kuwait to see what role the un and unsc played in that situation but ultimately it was a coalition of states that forcibly pushed iraqi forces back within their borders,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR1l2Wlpfb2tuRVBIS2o1enl0ZHFGTmI3a3pVX2g2cnFWSFlscVl4T2hPeE9LLWh5TkE5ZTdIT1ZtaXlCbWcxeExuWVJXc0NVcU9Qam9xZ1lxbkN5WFE9PQ==
unpaywalled link<url> edit originally posted wrong link fixed submission statement this opinion piece by ohio senator j d vance originally appeared in the financial times in february in it he criticizes europes military ineffectiveness and inability to provide for its own security arguing that american support has enabled european complacency in what amounts to a wealth transfer from american taxpayers to europe > in the aftermath of the cold war european nations made deep and lasting cuts to their defence budgets estimates suggest the continent would have spent an additional <cur><number>tn on defence over <number> years had they maintained cold war levels of military expenditure as the american defence budget nears <cur>tn per year we ought to view the money europe hasnt spent on defence for what it really is an implied tax on the american people to allow for the security of europe he goes on to argue that the us should end aid to ukraine and leave it to europeans to decide how to manage the russian problem he is effectively arguing for the most consequential reorientation of american policy toward europe since the second world war one in which the us would decouple its security interests from those of europe and leave europe to provide for its own defence or not i bring this article up now because donald trump announced today that he had selected vance to be his running mate in the <number> election and i think this has significant and interesting implications for both domestic american politics and foreign policy vances personal story is inescapably tied to his politics and political brand born into a poor and dysfunctional household he joined the marine corps after high school then graduated summa cum laude from ohio state with a degree in political science and philosophy before going on to graduate yale law his <number> memoirs hillbilly elegy a memoir of a family and culture in crisis became something of a cultural touchstone in america in it he discussed his troubled upbringing the cultural influence his mothers appalachian values had on him though vance was raised in ohio his mother hailed from piedmont kentucky and the crisis of despair that has overtaken many poorer regions in america vance is highly unusual in contemporary america as being someone who straddles the class divide having experienced both the poverty and lack of opportunity that afflicts large parts of the country outside the wealthy coastal enclaves and more desirable parts of major urban centers but also overcoming adversity to obtain the credentials that qualified him to be a card carrying member of the countrys elite it is a personal story that flatters elite myths about american meritocracy and also grants vance unique authority to speak about aspects of american society with which most highly privileged americans have no direct experience this no doubt goes a long way to explaining the exposure the book received along with the fact it was published in the same year that donald trump stunned the establishment by winning the presidency prompting a rush for insight into the voting preferences of poor white americans as indicated by this article vances foreign policy instincts are isolationist and this should be a wake up call for those who complacently assume that trump will be willing to continue americas traditional role in the western alliance as long as the allies pay their fair share the man trump handpicked to be one heartbeat from the presidency believes something very different in terms of domestic politics vance is an interesting hybrid of populist economics and traditional cultural values this is an underrecognized and underserved segment of western voters economically marginalized people who support redistributive economic policies like the traditional left but also reject innovation in social policy and identity construction like the traditional right this is potentially very fertile ground for political entrepreneurs like vance and sahra wagenknecht in germany,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUW9GVFhqY0QyaS1ZNGdIMVRmYl9iZkJYbE1qbVJFSmVBV2ppdTB6eC12MlJ1Q01pZ2JsQ3J3ekYtczFpZ1l3SF8tRFAyWHlla1ZYVFJVTWZRbWFnQnc9PQ==

i understand your point about the us strategy focusing on managing escalation to avoid direct conflict with russia however this approach has significant drawbacks by not fully committing to ukraines success the us inadvertently prolongs the conflict and increases the risk of wider instability while russia faces challenges in taking over ukraine dismissing the potential threat to europe overlooks russias broader strategic ambitions history shows that unchecked aggression often leads to further expansionist attempts european nations including nato are not prepared for a prolonged conflict of attrition unlike russia which operates on a wartime economy and uses millions of shells to level cities while treating human lives as cannon fodder europe values the lives of its citizens and is not ready for such a brutal conflict nothing indicates russia will stop its aggression consider russias repeated invasions of chechnya and other neighbors the baltics including estonia could be next on russias list to act like russia is not a threat is ignorance ukraine deserves praise for stopping russias advance so far but more support is necessary to prevent future threats inaction and insufficient support only embolden aggressors and make the world a more dangerous place its crucial to recognize and act on the true cost of inaction now,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQzRkRUF1RFlSWkJhSTh0WjMzLVV3cGVla0tIWGI0S2hORk1jSnlPTHdGNjA1OFpEM0VGMHUzVDNSdU44ZnhoNjlpRksxVU9ReXBrZHRXLWdVX1EwY2c9PQ==

the un is a legal instrument and rhe un charter is essentially the constitution of international law one of the things it establishes is when countries are allowed to wage war it allows three reasons to fight <number> self defense against an armed attack <number> assisting other countries in their self defense <number> acting on a mandate from the un security council unsc in practical terms there are obviously limits to the power of the un but in legal terms the unsc wields incredible power since it decides whether countries are allowed to wage war it also decides whether countries or even individuals should be punished for their behavior a good example of how the unsc can do this is the <number> gulf war where iraq invaded kuwait in response the unsc ended up granting a mandate to the us to gather a coalition of countries to forcibly liberate kuwait and thus legally wage an offensive war but it also established limits to how far the us could take such a war another example is the icty which was a court set up to trial international criminals from the breakup of yugoslavia here the unsc decided over the heads of the ex yugoslav countries that their leaders should be held accountable regardless of what the countries thought so a veto can be extremely significant in legal terms because it can prevent the unsc from in your case determining that france is illegally invading spain determine that the leaders of france should face a trial and even determine that other countries should sanction or even attack france in turn in this case the only thing that prevents legally starting a nuclear war is the french veto on a more current example vetoes on ukraine and palestine are the only thing preventing huge sanctions and demands for unilateral withdrawal if the unsc was purely democratic it is likely that both countries would face severe legal consequences as everyone loves to point out the actual power of un resolutions comes from the member states but this can be said for any law for instance traffic laws also only really work if people in the country respect them so therefore the unsc tends to use their power sparingly even when they can agree to act because the action will only be as strong as the states intending to act,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMmVtSFV5SVpCUVFQZGQ5UG1oTmxSVUFQYWdkZmtrMzVTZF9HMGFLelVXZV9yeko4UEJZUnlhOWtQY0d4SnhrdEcyNk9zVkhwMTFrQTdvUXFzamhKUGc9PQ==

well as i said countries have rhe right to assist in self defense so it does not prevent anything in practice that there is no unsc resolution what a resolution could do depends on its severity it could do anything from simply condemning the wars to order belligerents to act in a certain way to imposing sanctions or even wars what makes imposed sanctions important is that the unsc can impart obligations on all its members so if we stay in your french spanish war the the un could theoretically make it an obligation for all un members to sanction france or even make it an obligation to attack france or support this attack for instance the war in libya was done on the background of unsc resolutions that made it a legal obligation for all un members to sanction libya and later another resolution ordered nato to use all means necessary to prevent a genocide so the difference is not inherently the outcome but the legality of it for instance the nato intervention in kosovo was illegal and all but two nato countries have agreed it was illegal but they still felt they had to intervene so just like the traffic law does not prevent speeding international law does not prevent war but sometimes justifies it and thats the important point that countries are more likely to act when they have gotten a mandate from the unsc,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndjRWYUItMWRQWWlPSm9tQUZRM194N01CU0NYREdTNVR1T0ZyTzNJSTZ5eTJacnNnWjZnZ2gtV092WHlWbDVvM1cycGxpVGJkMzh2ZFZBdEVxSW8yN2c9PQ==

its a common argument that the us spends more on defense than european countries do both in total and as percent of gdp i have often wondered if this comparison is a bit disingenouous for the following reasons first the us spends on projecting its military across the entire globe not just in europe most european countries spend their entire defense budget on defending europe france and britain excepted also italy to a degree is it therefore valid to compare total us defense spending with total european defense spending second the costs of defense are more than the costs of paying for military hardware and personnel costs of infrastructure eg most of the funding by the eu per se the costs refugees entail borne by all of europe and especially the destruction of infrastructure and the economy that results from fighting on your own soil eg ukraine today can also be legitimately included as defense costs finally would the us be willing to match the costs that over <number> ukrainians have so far paid in the defense of european and us interests that of their lives edit i would add that if the us had actually matched european commitment to ukraine between <number> and <number> instead of congratulating russia on a genius wonderful and very savvy move perhaps we wouldnt be in the current predicament,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYm9OSDdvdEtUbXY1M25EX0k1X3c0TlFELV8zOHd0OExKVThDSVFxVVZfM2lwSzBSUVpfcnJGczMtLUFNMlFHQk1ldDVsNk5zUVNsWXlXa0dlM1pzRVE9PQ==

>the us inadvertently prolongs the conflict and increases the risk of wider instability the risks of escalation are deemed to present a greater challenge than the risk of prolonging the conflict furthermore you can also argue that a prolonged conflict is more likely to inflict a strategic defeat on russia compared to a short conflict if russia loses all of its equipment a lot of soldiers etc it will be unable to return to ukraine at least for some time on the other hand if it were quickly defeated in ukraine it could reorganize and try again shortly >history shows that unchecked aggression often leads to further expansionist attempts history shows that theres plenty of possibilities but if you only focus on expansionist examples as analogy to russia then sure theres only one possibility consider the korean war or the war between iraniraq these did not lead to the aggressor attempting further expansion after the fighting was done >europe values the lives of its citizens and is not ready for such a brutal conflict this is why were making sure the fighting is contained in ukraine wed rather ukrainians die than westerners just a long standing policy of the west if you think about it more applies to usa than anyone else though since europeans have died en masse in multitudes of wars >nothing indicates russia will stop its aggression theyre limited by their capabilities if your argument is that theyre a potential threat to nato then you cant also argue how brave and capable ukrainians have fought its one or the other either russia is incapable of taking over ukraine and ukraine deserves credit for its overwhelming successes or ukraine is going to get crushed since apparently russia wants to go after nato next so which one is it >inaction and insufficient support only embolden aggressors and make the world a more dangerous place its crucial to recognize and act on the true cost of inaction now rash actions and not considering the spheres of influence of each great power leads to a more dangerous world as well,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnamJTNUtSa1gzSlY2SF9KVjNxZ09jaWk0SU9RX1VTVTJ2ck41T01CNGkyRFcwQVFzN3V1YmkxcTNvd21xVS1LMUFzQjR4YTNqcDE0d2YyYXBBd2l6YVE9PQ==

there is no inherent power in the veto itself a ps veto power is backed by its ability to prevent it from happening with or without the un when a p member vetos they are just declaring that this isnt happening because i will prevent it using my militaryeconomicpolitical might because a p is usually able to enforce this declaration it is best for the country in question to follow the resolution they are not powerful enough to do otherwise doing it via veto is also good for the p because they could have things in their way without bloodshedeconomic disruptions etc p countries will carefully consider when they make this declaration if they make such a declaration but cannot enforce it afterwards if someone choses to ignore the un and does it anyways it would be hugely humiliating for the vetoing country and discredit their future declarations making their veto power useless and ignorable so countries would not veto on issues that they cannot or is unwanting to enforce even if they might not agree with it in this case they would abstain in your case france wants to invade spain and by using the veto power they declare that anyone who gets in my way is my enemy it would then be up to france to show that they are powerful enough to enforce this declaration if another country such as the us manages to ignore the resolution and stop france in its tracks frances veto power would lose credibility and be ignored in the future,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnakNjZXNXNldhR3otdmJiMS1hcWVoMFcxZThGQ0VqeWxxbG9ELTdFcUQ2a0hZaTQxYVVGemJVY2JXdFViRWtmdHFKYTJWaWtRVjQxOW9wRWhuZFFKd3c9PQ==
