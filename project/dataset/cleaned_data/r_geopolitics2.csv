the russians tend to be a real patriotic group particularly when the threat is foreign it is in their nature this is why their biggest and most celebrated holiday is the patriotic or victory day it is said on the streets of russia that there is hardly a family that did not lose someone during world war ii the russians commemorate the <number> million plus soviet soldiers and civilians who died during world war ii with elevated putins popularity and belief that us and its allies want to break up russia has fueled russians young and old alike to respond to the call to be ready and prepared these young people showing interest in defending their motherland are volunteers,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWVUtYSGVJWlhqQ1FiRDI5dUdmd0pOcVlRX3g3SWNzRDFQLWlZVWMwcm5PY0RqdkkydHplWEdGUmJ4N0Ryemo3TUV3eFFqT0RjUjRJYmd4VFpXRXlvcnc9PQ==

the author bret stephens essentially advocates for a fullfledged war against russia and elimination of hamas and et al to achieve peace instead he should have at least provided a lip service on how possibly to save ukraine while it still retains majority of the country intact and a twostate solution for peace in the middle east there is no defeating the russians and hamas is a philosophy not a standing army that would nevertheless settle for a twostate solution along with all the countries in the middle east his approach would also devastate all of europe among other countries and end up dividing the world even further in short he is a war monger who thinks wars can still be won when it involves super nuclear powers in relevant part stephens states >a peace deal with moscow that leaves it in possession of vast areas of ukrainian territory is an invitation for a third invasion once russia recapitalizes its forces a ceasefire with hamas that leaves the group in control of gaza means it will inevitably start another war just as it has five times before it also vindicates the strategy of using civilian populations as human shields something hezbollah will be sure to copy in its next fullscale war with israel,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWDh1U2J5Q3ktLXBaalBNVXJiSVFENEw2anFoZGFiT3VrcjJwNkwxaGU3c3pSbVI3VEt3NF9kX09WZFE0aHprc1QyN2NtOTlDaEMwY3B2MTRhb0JtYmc9PQ==

it is important to note that united <number> is a media group launched by zelensky this sounds more like a poor attempt at deflection because zelensky has consistently advocated boycott of russia including shaming businesses and entities and even employing threats against countries that did not completely boycott russia although the majority of the businesses still remain in russia zelensky was successful in his attempts to force most eu countries to boycott russian olympic athletes and entire teams from participation despite much opposition so he is now just going to equate any attack with events of olympics knowing that a russian offensive may be in the offing macron tried to play cute by offering russia a peace treaty during the olympics in france putin mocked it by noting the general boycott of russian athletes and those that have allowed some individuals to participate they only may do so without the display of russian flags or anthem and under a neutral flag i believe putin was thinking more about another minsk type stunt by eu a major offensive may well come in june or july but it is related to weather and climate conditions in that region preparation and coordination although russia has not made public the specifics of the multiple incursion points putin did announce early in march creation of a sanitary or buffer zone because of deadly attacks on belgorod by ukrainian forces primarily targeting civilians a month after the initial announcement during a trip to china putin noted that the present intent was not to capture kharkiv but only to create a buffer zone he added though the extent of buffer zone could change depending on the conditions all of europe and us knows this presently the russian backup reserve in that area is only about <number> there will likely be at least another <number> to <number> before putin makes his move ukraine claims its defense will depend on being allowed to use western arms to strike military targets across the border in russia along with troops to operate the machineries this is a big issue that most of eu and us is preparing for however russia is not just standing still it too as always preparing for a bigger war putin just hosted the taliban leaders and he is expected to announce it no longer considers it a terrorist group likely followed by recognition as the legitimate or only government in afghanistan the visit coincides with his visit to several other countries who are a part of shanghai cooperation organization the military alliance formed by the collective security treaty organization i will not be surprised if several hundred thousand will be joining the war on the russian side depending on the extent of missile attacks that strike russia and number of nato troops in ukraine all indications are the war is about to get much more intense and expansive although russia has not drawn any redline i think fs may be one along with certain longrange missile attack in old russia that could result in a major retaliation by russia outside of ukraine,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsVWF1RExpYVJCTkduYXBxY045My1LQjBFenUtWUcwejMwTlY3OXM3TTJTV0lkNGtoT1diZUlTZWlSNHYycThvZndHNDh6QjY4cUN1Uk8yVmNLYU1Fd3c9PQ==

the rules are changing now as most nato countries openly admit direct participating they have always been a participant but now are a little more open about it therefore i will not be surprised that russia increasingly may view several of the baltic states as a threat us first and eu later wanted further nato expansion now they have to fight for it russia wants a neutral ukraine with an expanded buffer zone if russia can be made a target of nato weapons it would be foolish to think russians will just stand by however i do not believe russia has a greater design the only country that did was the us that wanted to surround russia first with turning the baltic states into nato but it crossed the line with ukraine now it must defend its ambitions finally the author is educated and certainly knowledgeable about the ukrainian perspective the special correspondent for the kyiv post,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJueTVWY2RlVHFlMzVSZktpR3BSTmNLOFZ1Y05xTmMyU3hKdzBNX05PTGZWWFhNSGJHM05SYTd2TUJyOHlOQU9SZUpibW91NXhrQTV5LWdYc2dPVEJDcmc9PQ==

not a shred of evidence that us is helping hamas presently however it is not unusual for us to work closely with terrorists and extremists of all sorts when it serves our purpose netanyahu himself supported hamas and made it an obstacle for palestinian authority to reach a solution and he later bragged about it us worked very closely with isis and also supported and funded it and propped it up to fight against assad until russians screwed up the plan us also funded islamists in the afghan war including osama in trying to oust the ussr we worked with saddam in its war against iran it is not any different than zelensky working with azov in short we are not any more moral than a pit bull when it comes to preserving our interests to rule the world except pit bulls can remain loyal but we can turn on our allies on a dime we have demonstrated that time and again i am not sure if biden is ready to turn on netanyahu just yet but if netanyahu continues to delay the peace plan there is a likelihood he will not to support hamas but get someone in power who will say yes like a robot to a peace deal i also think there is a possibility of biden turning on the comedian turn dictator the only question is who he will use to topple him he has been a little too critical of biden lately and biting the hand that feeds him zelensky should thank biden morning noon and night if he wants to stay in power,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTi1qUFZXaVVPOUVxZ1ZyUE10cFdjbUlJbWQ4a0stajItME9CR0R0MlpUQS1vZzA3bTFoZ0NYTkZmclFNTkdQY2pVbWpxQVdqMHctek9raWJVVVZmZ0E9PQ==

i suppose being a hostage is probably quite close to being taken a prisoner by an enemy who may consider you of some value such as in a prisoner exchange or perhaps of no value at all the hostage has no assurance or any guarantees of getting out alive from a situation like that and indeed some do not they could face torture and if injured uncertainty of treatment and food insecurity what makes it a really terrible ordeal in my opinion is that someone who is taken hostage is innocent and the hostage taker knows this but does not care even where there is no abuse involved by the hostage or prisoner taker there is never any assurance of safe return where it is accompanied with abuse that just further dehumanizes the person perhaps at least in some cases than living under some brutal occupation like in ukrainian conflict or someplace else like in gaza,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvajdPZFgtYURXZjN0MHFYMjFTREozWWRGNk9faEc0SnQxN3hldU9kaUZ4RWs0NDM1cVRBbTc5M3lQMXp3SnpGUlFBT0VMLUlycWo4RXVtTHl6TlZWeEE9PQ==

yes the war is just not fought in the battlefields however scare tactics only works where there is a credible capacity to put another in fear of unacceptable loss does russia have a credible capacity to put european countries where scare capacity is effective without use of nuclear weapons certainly the bigger question and the only issue is whether russia has capacity to put in fear us itself here us is a bigger power than the us and it has a bigger capacity to scare russia but it has to go full bore it is not going to go full bore because us has always been unwavering in its position it just wants for ukraine to continue the fight so long as it can it only wants a proxy battle hence russia will continue its attrition war,r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRFIxMGtRRF92cWhJeGRPOVNKcUc2SWphaVZDb003cUtYRWVNX3poSUxMTHJCRnRBM3Q5OEk2S1VzOTV3UVB6X2FQTk9ITUpURk5Pckd1QVBGZUpjOEE9PQ==
