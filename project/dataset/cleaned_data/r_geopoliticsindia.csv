dont worry im not accusing you of anything or trying to attack you im just trying to have a discussion since whenever i have asked this question here i havent got a proper or coherent response before you are one of the first people to try and address my question properly regarding your second paragraph hamas started this war when they massacred over a <number> israeli civilians in a brutal terrorist attack i dont get why that doesnt count for anything particularly in the global south which has refused to condemn the october th attacks for the most part in fact i think india is one of the few countries in the global south to even condemn what hamas did its not related to my initial question but i was just curious why this is the case also in terms of international opinion if we take the un as an indicator because im not sure what else we can use the vast majority of countries in the general assembly have routinely voted in favour of resolutions calling for an end to the russia ukraine war in fact up to <number> countries voted in favour of the very first resolution on this matter which was only slightly less than the number of countries that voted in favour of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in gaza in other words that looks pretty overwhelming to me <url><url> yet despite this india stood firm and abstained from the resolution i just wonder why india doesnt have this same conviction with regards to resolutions on gaza is it really just because of the <number> million indians that live in the gulf countries and oil,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdE9ZR2FiQm1tTXJxSF9DZzBPaldoV05nX0ZpSkZIMGxpR29lSzhGaGZGOFg1WWVqa3FNWTRRaTRWa3pUc1E4RThicmk4STFSUW52bVJCaWtiMVZuVmc9PQ==

devastating attack on india and how he conducted those attacks this is disrespectful to all those indians who lost their lives and indias right to defend itself and no i refuse to stop obsessing over the <number> war my grandparents and parents lived through that trauma along with many oldergeneration indians i got to experience my childhood hearing about the outbreak of the kargil war during the summer of <number> on the news i also got to hear about the <number><number> terror attacks in <number> to this day i still see news about pakistans latest terror attacks you dont tell ww survivors to move on from ww but even if i move past your remarkably insensitive comment the <number> war continues to be very relevant to indias relationship with the us and pakistan this is literally the war whose aftermath inspired pakistans bleed india with a thousand cuts doctrine leading to pakistans transition to using terror attacks as its primary method of making life hell for indians to this day and i earlier gave you examples of terror attacks from just this past month the us refused to rein in pakistan after the war and instead continued to give unabashed support to pakistan and do you genuinely not find it hilarious that a poor nation on the verge of economic and societal collapse also conveniently has a relatively advanced military or that it still gets loans despite all the horrific things pakistans military rulers have done its almost as if all these loans to pakistan go to its continued military buildup and vast terror network if the us actually forced pakistan to follow through with restructuring its economy under conditional loans pakistan wouldnt be the basket case with nukes that it is today it seems like the us likes pakistan being ruled by a military dictatorship with a continued warlike stance towards india after all gotta keep a check on the worlds largest democracy which has never initiated any conflict since its founding by rubberstamping loans to a genocidal dictatorship right > news flash the soviet union is dead and the modern russian state is essentially an economic colony of china from sanctions busting to chief crude importer <number> i gave examples of how russia has helped india well past <number> again a lot of indias critical weaponry such as brahmos is possible because of joint development programs with russia into the s russia also maintains ties with india because it doesnt want to solely rely on china china also doesnt want russia to become another north korea whereby nks crazy actions cause scrutiny on china due to chinas direct ties with nk having russia as a close but not close enough ally ensures china avoids more scrutiny russia still supplies discounted oil that benefits india meanwhile the us continues to threaten sanctions against india knowing full well that india needs it and europe buys that oil > its military now relies on great wall motors for its suvs <number> and thats precisely why india is gradually phasing out its dependence on russia and trying to work with other nations such as france and israel however india will not abandon russia which would then bring russia much closer to china if it can still reap benefits this is how most nations operate yet somehow its only indias justified reliance on russia that gets put in the spotlight india will do whats best for india case closed,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOFVkYkNiS0hMaVZqSXVFVTZlZUc5QWxudjVqS1Y3alJaeWdXOHBUNFZMcVRHdHdRWktqWl9pbHZxekU0ZU1Pb1RlSVBNblNCUTJqZ2xKdUhnNVJJZXc9PQ==

i would like to add that pakistan has only ever been sanctioned by the us for possessing and testing its nukes just as india has pakistan never faced the fallout for hosting bin laden like how afghanistan got invaded because they did the exact same thing earlier pakistan never gets sanctioned for hosting terror groups like iran does but i guess the paki terror groups tend to be mainly confined to attacking indians so thats okay with americans and some of them like david headley are former us agents has pakistan ever been sanctioned for its horrific genociding of its minorities once againno so to conclude the light wrist slaps that pakistan gets along with its continued weapons transfers and loan transfers make it really hard for india to trust the us dont try and pretend that pakistan isnt treated as a strategic us asset even to this day india will maintain ties with russia just like how the us continues to maintain ties with pakistan,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb3lJa2FkYnhqN0ZJbVJ3ZkczdWNITjdWWHpodGtsaTVNOFdoaEpFVjFGRElpYVg1UFlmaGFSSHk3bERUS0xYMEpBQ3VDY0UzYVpxWHBsVGo1R084MXc9PQ==

it is for the best that tesla is not looking at investing in india as a high priority teslas are expensive and at the current design and price of a base tesla model india is unlikely to be the big market it thinks it is second india as an export base is not a good idea for example exports of cars from india to thailand is <number> tariffs but <number> for exports from vietnam india has no free trade agreements and is a big disadvantage to use india as a base for exports second due to one of the highest tariffs in india imports of components for manufacturing result in higher cost of products and it is difficult to export to other countries india needs market reforms starting with lowering tariffs forcing indian manufacturers to become more competitive how can that be done make land acquiring more efficient introduce labor reforms reduce the regulatory burden on manufacturing reduce tariffs to se asia levels make free trade agreements investment will flow in when investors see they can get a return on their investment vietnam ids doing that now for now tatas should continue to expand ev manufacturing in india their cost of the product is very competitive if they faced the same duties as vietnam they too could export their evs globally,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa0xReGZPUzY0MzRpR3cxbldmXzdBWnpwVGJUeGczUmthLTdKUXI4YUNXY2hhREFSN1hGWW5FellRcXRsUFJZZFdkQXp5Z0lnajg4b2I2ckJfOVBYNmc9PQ==

in <number> china had fdi of <number> billion and now its <number> billion with western countries not keen on investment in china when you compare fdi as a percentage of gdp its not even close i do agree with you on a good portion of indias fdi being round tripping of investments to dodge taxes but even taking that into account indias fdi is impressive when interest rates are high in the west its highly likely india will go past <number> billion in fdi during ndas third term and i can see china go below <number> billion china is a middle income country but i would say its more like india where people either make it or they dont not sure if you were able to read the article since it was behind a paywall but after the visit china has let tesla implement its self driving technology in china now that service will be more lucrative than selling cars in the long run yes china ev industry is competitive and thats why teslas growth has leveled off but that does not mean teslas brand has dropped india has large tariffs and gst on cars which makes luxury cars not viable towards the middle class and bmw does has not released a car for the indian market india as an auto market is over <number> million cars and it should probably double over the next <number><number> years as people move from rural areas and into urban areas i would not say india only has a market for cheap products since iphones are not cheap and people in india are buying a lot of them india is developing at a fast pace its consumer market will explode over the next <number><number> years regardless of which political party is in power,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWGNPTkc4Y0JobUdFNUdFUGJFY2dLdl8wUk9zdEtFYnRqSkk0eEdXNk8wZGcwQjNIOGtUcFAzdGtRQnFsWGVJbHNyRU8yb0QxaTNNU01xRG5OTW5laW05V2ZIa0NwZG42RTNfa3R1SkNNbW89

bro you dont get it the us by way of its tech controls the narrative thats way more than just deleting tweets its information warfare at its best there is no bigger power in the world that controlling the narrative today elections in india are fought on narratives narrative for the right vs that of the left what bot accounts post what their algorithm chooses to boost and what is eventually shown to a lot of people vs what is supressed a simple very recent example meta boosted stand with rafah posts on instagarm but when the indian right made a similar hashtag stand with reasi it was supressed this is how information is controlled from reaching people the algorithims are tampered with theyre biased and what supportive are you talking about you do reealize the reason indians harbor such strong feelings towards china and have gone soft on the west is also because of an extensive propaganda capapaign by the west in india think about it who would benifit the most if india and china go to war and lets be honest why are indians so antichina because they took indian territory galwan bro americans fund the entire pakistani military american jets fs were used by pakistan to down indian jets in balakot they sent their feel to the bay of bengal in the s to fight india so yeah theyre not in direct confrontatoin with us but how many indians have died due to american interfearence so what if they control everything within ther country as long as they are not tryng to fracture our society from within ill take a known enemy at the door anyday and wdym the us society is free and not controlled do you even know about the nsa spyware post <number><number> they spied on us citizen you think they arent spying on you do you even know about the us history and they shit they do that has been covered up i am sure you know about the nazi camps for jews do you the us had camps for japenese living within the us during ww any person of japnese descent was thrown into these camps without a shred of proof the point im trying to make isboth are bad i believe one is worse than the other but yes both are v v bad and the best way for india to navigate this situation is to normalize ties with china so we can get the best of both worlds and play one against the other keeping both of them guessing about what side were on is the best way to get cooperation from them,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR1JINDlpM1JDQUhHSlBEVUs0dVFtektwUVphV1RfTGNnMkg2ZkdvaUZ2bmxVMnE1cmJUN194YzdJTE9ZUlZsckdQclJwYWIzcnNsWEpCelN0ejlyZDE5XzJVT2tWMmozUDVGUTZmbzVOcVU9

marxists have a long history in india during the second world war the communists opposed the quit india movement once russia was attacked by germans previously they were happy to support the germans when the soviet union and china split the india communist party also split cpi was pro soviet while cpm was pro chinese cpm went to the extent of refusing to condemn the genocide in bangladesh because china supported pakistan even to this day cpm has failed to condemn chinese expansionism nor have they ever criticized human rights violations in tibet hong kong or the treatment of uighurs why they talk about democracy and human rights in india incessantly and then become inexplicably silent about the millions killed in concentration camps in china it is indeed hard to understand i think it is a form of mental slavery when we blindly support somebody we become mental slaves unable to pick and choose what parts to agree with we feel like we have to agree with everything they say or do people readily see the usa as a country to be admired for some things and criticized for other things cpm to this day hasnt found a single substantive wrong with china,r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNDJtdjUzbjUtWlFYRkZvVEdMUkVhLTZ5VHQ5RGZCeUdBbXJSaGVKZG40ZHVaYmJBaVQ5aEp6REdfdlhYQU1hLU9oQ3RyLXJQQ2VUMV9NVXJqaUdGTFE9PQ==
