yes america has forgotten the lesson of the <number>s when britain and france was faced with an insatiable dictator hitler it failed to stand its ground to defend democracy today the united states is the only nation positioned to lead forcefully against the dictator putin biden is moving cautiously but he must be more forceful in confronting russia simply put the longer we allow authoritarianism survive and thrive in eastern europe the greater the risk they will breakout and use threats and selective war to dominate a big portion of the world dictators an authoritarian regimes threaten freedom we beyond their boarders they unduly influence democracies promote corruption and set a oppress their people if america doesnt stand strongly in support of the ukraine we will have to face a stronger and more corrosive foe in a few years not a proponent of war or being the worlds policeman however we need to recognize threats and respond accordingly hey i am a lifelong democrat but the republicans are taking advantage of this situation to reestablish their reputation for international strength obamas failure to respond to syrias violation of his red line is coming back to haunt biden china is also going to take advantage of our preoccupation in ukraine to threaten taiwan presidents dont get to choose their crisees but they need to respond with strength intellect and clarity i have not heard nearly enough in the media about putin as a global threat god bless biden with the intestinal fortitude to guide america,r/globalaffairs,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSemYyeDhvcG9NeThKQktaT0VCTDI2WURpUkN1M01HQUpEUkF2RE1iVFNJei1IX0ZtaHBCcHVGUDM2LXBRTExkT0J0VnprLWZ0MGRvX1AzWGI0ZHMzc3ljbkN5Yldia1FFWHFHTWJ3cGMwRHM9
