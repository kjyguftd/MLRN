the ketogenic diet is an extremely low carb the highfat eating routine that imparts numerous similitudes to the atkins and low carb slims down it includes definitely lessening carb admission and supplanting it with fat this decrease in carbs places your body into a metabolic state called ketosis despite its popularity its still not known why or even if the keto diet works researchers from the university of california riverside are attempting to find out more and therefore establish whether keto is right for you scientists from the university of california riverside are studying how the popular keto and intermittent fasting diets work on a molecular level and whether both sexes benefit from them equally the idea behind the keto diet is that low levels of carbohydrates and very high levels of fat and protein will force the body to use fat as fuel resulting in weight loss its a diet that has grown in popularity in recent years and food manufacturers have reflected this with more and more products geared towards those on the keto regime intermittent fasting operates on a similar principle restricting eating to a small window of time during the day during the hours without food the body exhausts its stores of sugar and switches to burning fat the fat gets converted to ketone bodies that the brain can use as fuel click here to know more httpsbit lygtcqw remove space in between,r/globalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSNndlY1VoVnN6cXhfdVN1cHUxMFhrbFZBOGRSLXB3ZC1HZ3F4d1dIXzdtUlB1ai12bFliYW9OejZmU25sSE5wMUwwTUhuNHlnTHF2eGZEUDNTNXgxSWc9PQ==
