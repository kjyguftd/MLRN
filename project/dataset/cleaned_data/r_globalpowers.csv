there literally isnt any indication on open source platformssocial medianews circles about any potential israeli slbms in development except some renderings on ms paint by artist hi sutton on the dakar class submarine with its enlarged sail suggesting as such but that enlargement could be a pod for deployment of shayetet <number> sfs or maybe just a vls for their mm dia popeye turbo slcms rather than slbms either way if this is a calculated reveal i appreciate the scant details youopmoderator must know people at iais rocket division in beer yakov to get some info like this,r/globalpowers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYVJ5aUp5S2NsN3hXRUI1a2JjbnllUEVjMmJhb1dZa0o2dkE4ZlN0QnVEUXpZVG9ad1k0eGVhUnhRYUR4Q1A0X1JUOS1YTmM3Z2RyNl85RlJwRGV6dHc9PQ==
my best guess at this point is that the dakar class including the latest ins drakon with its enlarged sail is most likely a vls for additional popeye turbo slcms rather than an slbm i thought those were harder to designtest not very feasible to operatecoz of small size of dakar class especially for the israeli navy given they arent a full fledged blue water navy in comparison to larger ones like usrussia china,r/globalpowers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTFRsa3N2engxTjNRX3RjMkVlcW9DeGsxNGQwYVhqcTRWYjktd2ZXN0lKYWFLNHRhaHhDdWZlOE5Ma0dpVHVlcHEtVnNidktYSC0zR2NZVXlPQTdmR3c9PQ==
