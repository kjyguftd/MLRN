usually those actions that benefit others are considered good and those that harm others are considered evil the more interesting part is determining who benefits and who suffers if your village is low on clean water and you build a dam and distribution system for your village and no one goes thirsty that would be considered a good act done with good intentions the next village downstream may now have a reduced river flow and could be facing issues they might consider that dam building actitiy to be evil if the dam builder starts charging for the water to cover costs and all the accounting is transparent and audited it would be considered a neutral act if he has a goal to make a profit on a resource required for life then we are back to evil,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXcGhvX1VQb0JPVDkxaVd2c2NkWWdYVDBCS2d1Nm4zYWhING52TmlfQjJ5Q1plZUtmNlJQUmhhdHRYMHhYa3RyRFBleEFKZWJEMjdjLUoxNjBzN0laZGc9PQ==

i completely disagree with your statement its important to separate fact from hyperbole project <number> is a conservative policy agenda aiming to restructure government operations and emphasize traditional values but claiming that it advocates for killing or incarcerating people based on their personal lives is baseless and inflammatory to be clear no credible evidence supports the idea that trump or his administration has sought to implement such extreme measures against any group these types of exaggerations only serve to polarize and spread fear detracting from meaningful discussions on policy impacts instead of resorting to scare tactics lets focus on the specific elements of project <number> and engage in a factbased debate about its implications,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRnNYem9RNFV0aUN4dXQ5ckhPaExadFVtanFkbGV3MERKNTNEMXZBeG4yNW1zMXY0NUVBdENPSGFEeTFsNzU2Ymx6LTM0akJURHQtVlBBSEZaRDFmWHc9PQ==

love the downvotes let me actually lay out how to think critically which you all lack while the political landscape around trump is highly charged claiming that no truth or fact can emerge because of personal agendas is both defeatist and inaccurate countless independent and credible investigative journalists watchdog organizations and factcheckers work tirelessly to uncover and present the truth suggesting that all of them are manipulated or twisted undermines the very foundation of democratic scrutiny and accountability furthermore blaming one individual for all mayhem and chaos oversimplifies complex sociopolitical issues we should focus on specific actions and policies analyzing them with critical thinking and evidencebased reasoning spreading blanket condemnations without factual basis only fuels division and hinders productive dialogue lets strive for a more nuanced and informed discussion,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVnVhNXVMcU04VFNPVVVqSi1NN0RuUVA1bmQyYTF2RG1kanhZdUxPb1dlcXBmaGc0NWU4T1kwSktIVzNVeWVJMEktVWtLRkFqeXhMRFUtdWh6YmRnNFE9PQ==

>after this he will for sure be elected again unfortunately ive been wondering about this certainly my gut says the same thing but is there any statistical evidence to support this even crude statistical evidence obviously there is only a small sample size of us presidential candidates who survived assassination attempts but what if we broaden it to candidates for any elected us federal positions or candidates for chief executive in any modern western democracy however researchers see fit to define that has anyone ever studied this,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVVd4M24xM0czd05QeFlFalJNM0xyRVFsYnpJQVRaZHRmQWhLZmItN3JnOUFYR0NVVzIydS1VMzVlNlkzNE1fcmhQN1dWa3M5OVA2X2RNQVlmUEIyQkE9PQ==
i think at bare minimum they would almost always have to already be in power i could probably think of exceptions im not about to say it would have been bad if hitler was killed before taking office but that is only with the benefit of hindsight re possibly the most infamous world leader in history the target being in power doesnt inherently make it ok but it is pretty much a prerequisite imo,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYmRmTGpISkE3bWNTSnNyUEQtT1pGZHY4czQ2TXJzSHRtY013QVUtY2FqQzUybUtGQk1Xemk5bThrVndnSE1NUWdkakFjM2Z2OGJZTnU4YXdQbDhXNmc9PQ==

please feel free to correct me if you have a source to do so but as far as i recall the us is the largest country by population with a truly democratically elected head of state by a decent margin so im not sure broadening the sample size by including other countriess heads of state would be accurate before anyone says india the president of india is elected by the stateterritory legislatures and national parliament not directly by the citizens,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSjhIZFU1U2VaMjd4SFNlb3hRcFJzZExTSVZVT3N6Ulp0dHZhNF9oUnp3UlN5WXdwbWg5NGlwUENRYkVDR1lXY2RCUF9wZ0QzY3FINDNpS0Q2X1NBeHc9PQ==

i think trumps first public speech after this will sound something like this >german national comrades >i do not know how many times meanwhile an attempt on my life has been planned and carried out when i speak to you today it happens for two reasons ><number> so that you hear my voice and know that i am unhurt and healthy myself ><number> so that you can learn more about a crime that is unparalleled in german history >a very small group of ambitious unscrupulous and at the same time unreasonable criminalstupid officers has plotted a conspiracy to eliminate me and at the same time to wipe out with me practically the whole general staff of the german wehrmacht the bomb which was laid by the colonel count of stauffenberg exploded two meters on my right side it has severely injured a number of my dear employees one of them died i myself am completely unhurt except for very small skin abrasions bruises or burns i take it as a confirmation of the mission of providence to continue to pursue my life purpose as i have done so far for i may solemnly confess it before the whole nation that from the day on which i entered the wilhelmstrasse i had but one single thought to fulfil my duty to the best of my knowledge and belief and that since i realized that the war was inevitable and could no longer be postponed that since then i have lived only for my people in worry in work and worry and in countless days and sleepless nights hitlers radio proclamation about the assassination attempt on <number> july <number>,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQUgtVWwwT1lscDAwdUFMNHBYQl9odjlXN1EtX21DMm02dVJybUpQRkdVOE4zYWRma1dwZDRYMVlCZk1kMUgtcGx1NHVqN3cyRTJZbnE2dGRIdU5VdGc9PQ==

the fact that i have to question if this was real or staged to use as fuel for a political win disturbs me to my core i believe that trump followers would die for the cause i also believe normal rational people can be driven to commit acts of this nature my rather large family and i have gathered more than once to seriously discuss the similarities between the rise of nazi germany and the trump administration lies propaganda fear and hate mongering planned insurrections yes i believe it was planned his comments over the years regarding placing people in camps stating that he was the chosen one i realized suddenly that during these recent family discussions regarding events over the past <number> years are very similar to the gatherings my great grandparents and family members had in germany before they escaped and during the insanity and genocide understanding this during our discussions brought me to a terrifying rationalization its happening again i cant shake that feeling i also believe that trump is a kgb plant promised oligarch level wealth to weaken the country from the inside for take over its possible that russia china and north korea are involved shaping the trump landscape ukraine is a horrifying crime against humanity used to distract from russian involvement foreign hacker groups known to work for their government establishments were found to have successfully infiltrated us infrastructure gathering information for at least a decade they may know how to shut everything down and cause a chaotic shit storm the united states is under attack from both internal and external forces and i feel like im watching the end of the united states of america i am an educated and rational man reading everything i just wrote sounds like a paranoid conspiracy rant i roll my eyes when ive heard crazy shit like this in my life i hope and pray that im wrong and the obvious events that have occurred over the past <number> years are only frightening coincidence god help us all,r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmkwSlQ1VnMtV3hxU3FZTXQySVVoOTBrUGNpVzc5R3NuZjBNT2pabmQ4RVdQOTRxY3BOd0dMSXhxNVkwUDhVVnkzNlBDby1HeWloeDNtVlJCSE1ScVE9PQ==
