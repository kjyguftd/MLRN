well it depends as there are many factors all of the larger enterprises that ive consulted for had some form of baselining and deviance detection going on as it is a relatively quick and easy win these were environments where youd likely see apts attempt to employ this sort of tactic as you go down in size into the smb market i frequently saw the data being collected but not actioned on or alerted on however id argue that youre less likely to see this technique employed in those smaller smb environments but there are so many variables in that equation the data transfer limitations are the big thing low and slow is the goal for an apt and in red team engagements but there is such thing as too slow depending on the objectives being targeted dns for c communication is great for a long haul c in a tiered c deployment but data exfil there are much better techniques that are less prone to detection,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbVNOMTlmdWtTbmlFb1l5aEN1czFRUW14WDE4akcyVzAxNk5hNHUzUERmUkdZdUxHUm5TUkZvWGRhUHpJLVFiWTNNRUpmUVc4XzJrRWhIWTl1b3A3eUJaZzJjNzZMOUhHM05YLVc4Y2hYX1U9

in a normal home setup having access to your router means having access to any internally exposed service in your netwok they could configure a vpn for maintaining the access to your network and then just wait to find a critical vuln in a software you use for getting access it should be possible for them to throw a mitm attack and sniff some non encrypted traffic these days this is not too common,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYTM4VGhRZ3pQRVhnMU5DODVUdWJPdmpjQlJzTmFkR2VINC1YSGNKcUZuVzZrNkpmUU1xUzBDUC04SndPWW1uSlc3bXZKc1RLMUJPOHppUGQ1ZHItVFE9PQ==

looks like the printer indeed was hacked at some point this seems to be a small hacker group that hacks devices that are accessible directly in the internet which really shouldnt be when you google the name and printer you can see that even google indexed crazy many printers which were just sitting in the internet waiting to be hacked <url> its impossible to say what this group did on the printer maybe they installed a backdoor maybe they just added this to the display name to scare people my best guess would be to download a new image for the printer and completely wipe and flash it but tbh i have never done that and i have no idea how to do it,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaVY4OUVBd2FZNHh1Mi1SY09zZUJWZ3ZDeWZHcTN4SV9qM1ZBaXNVUnJmVDNtZUdBM2NjVFd5U0pUOFh4a2E4VnVIODMxVHpacUdxRlVjOWQ1Qm5rWUE9PQ==
change your default dns to one they control mitm your traffic steal logins and move be laterally to other devices on the network that being said its probably outside your threat model for an attacker to go after your router on your home network they would either have to be connected to your home network compromise a device that is connected to your network or your would have had to set your router login page to be accessible to anyone on the internet,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcmFLSDNmZUozT0I2WlRNQTZUejRrQXhUeFlfcDhaZmp1RmhndGpIZmhGNlhmamtRMi04dEt3S1h5SmVqVzkxRjNZREVGOGhOdEpfYlAzRlFJc2xEYVE9PQ==
a compromised network device impacts all downstream devices they would literally be a maninthemiddle and have the ability to intercept or redirect all your traffic theoretically worse case would be to install a custom firmware on the router like openwrt and gain full access to everything that passes through in practice though thats less likely as those projects are not as well maintained these days as a goal an attacker would use this to further compromise internal hosts this can be done by pivoting from the router looking for vulnerabilities on connected hosts or poisoning internal traffic such as dns and redirecting internal hosts to malicious sites in actuality if someone is attacking your router from the inside you have other problems andor have already been compromised,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYanVpbnA3dmdkd2ZwT2VjX01JWUxIdVg4S3BqREp4VW5wbmlpVk5HUUJWVE4wMjFGYmtqaHplTkllcXJnQ3VTbjRQT1IySTZvNkh6aThNNXg5dmlldWc9PQ==

thats assuming you can hack the router itself with the given assumptions only i think you have fewer options especially since almost all internet traffic is encrypted and theres nothing you can do about it if the router is compromised then yeah dns redirecting could happen if the user is configured to use isp dns even if theyre using an isp dns you have to get lucky enough for them to not notice the redirect and getting tipped off even establishing a proper mitm attack isnt a caseclosed compromise on modern machines after all theyre made with the assumption that theyre being mitmed i suppose you could think of it another way though if they are able to access your network as a peer they can sniff to see which websites youre connected to better yet they can probably tell when the house is empty based on call phone connections and rob the place edit the question is worded weirdly i see now that the op is talking about the password to the admin interface assuming they have both the network password and the password to the router itself then we might be able to assume something along the lines of option <number> mitm using a proxy set up in the router perhaps + custom dns set up in the router perhaps,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNlhNVjlvMGtWOVhTODc2SVlQTU5od3Y5WXJRNENGNWRwa0lFeUFzVXhqVnN2eUlveU9xc0NlQXduMm9qNlpiMW9Td3pHcG1ZZ0NFRDZhTzhsX0pQeVE9PQ==

not heard of man on the side could you mean side channel attack a side channel attack is one where you use some data that leaks out of the system a classic side channel attack might be listening to the buttons click on a physical combination lock open when on buttons make a diffrent sound to open when off buttons when it comes to side channel attacks in the computer world you get to some really complex shit like monitoring the power consumption of the device when giving it different data or more recently we have seen timing based attacks used to work out what data is stored in the cache which can be cross vm on a shared infrastructure,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTzF0bmhsZkE3VVo2S1l0clplcE5NZ3MzbTJ0YTIyTlRsSTRvTkJVbzd3OTgxUGlHZkZDMmtVUGNTSEs2bFdNRFlrNlhRRDFXSEFXYS1LNEMtV3VST0E9PQ==
mitm means that the attack functions by inserting itself between two parties that would normally be communicating directly with oneanother this is typically achieved by pretending to be both parties by diverting traffic by some means while ive never actually heard of mots attack if i had to guess it would mean either intercepting andor injecting communications to manipulate the situation i suppose that a wifi dns cache poisoning attack as a vector for initiating a mitm attack could be thought of as a type of mots attack technically anything that isnt a mitm seems like it would be a mots attack but thats just my naive self rambling conjecture if you ever need an endless supply of rants and rambles just surf my reddit user account,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV2dyVFNCc3plVHU3OTUtc1pfb2xuZVF4MFZ3X1RGMUJJNGZkU3g4QzJEYmJRRzQtaW5iS1puU081ZlFFc2pDVnlhaHo0M1kyS0hlemVaY19CSHJBeXc9PQ==

have you read and understood the wiki article it is a freaking complicated often time based attack where you have to have already a privileged network access like on a internet backbone so probably this is nothing what the usual man can pull of easy so it is used by intel agencies and that kind of actors and because of this it is not widely used low effort attacks are more common becauseore people have the setting to pull that off,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWUd3aWdwYU9reTJjeUE5bzJkYXlLRFJEUTRrazhvSVFZb0YxVzR0cEc1NjFTZWdWOTFpOThqTHc3Si1UV1ZnRzlWWDBkQjd1X3NHLXRpNnE3OTg1T3c9PQ==

the best i can explain with this is as follows in reverse engineering you take note of key patterns such as if xxxxxx = true then send true what you would then do is change it from true to false see what happens if what happens may be you attempt to login and it succeeds on a failed password what you did was tell the app passwordcorrect = false then send true this is just a super basic and common type among easier applications its all about pattern and action recognition key phrases to functions like authenticate verify or success may be function names you may check for something like this and from there youd find the exact locations,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTEh2dmlWS0tlMk1PenZCRlNnZFdhQ0JJbnkwZDBnTzAzTTFsd1JwaXJRVGs5Ri04YUxYTURJYzNwOTM5ZzAwUE4walBiM3Z5ejl0N1RtSnhlT3k5WVE9PQ==

the main flaw in your thought is that you dont need to know the source code to find or run exploits it greatly helps which is why opensource code is usually safer but its not needed by any means you can still break things without fully understanding reverse engineering is also a thing similar to your title in a sense nothing is impossible some things are just way harder than others take breaking into a car or house as an example are you going to choose a target that is fenced off with tons of lights doors sensors etc or are you going to choose a target with none of that same goes for hacking no target is <number> secure but some are stupid easy and others may take years there certainly are bad actors out there who are spending years on a single target to learn plan and execute an attack but <number> of bad actors are simply looking for that next easy target,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU0Q2MHh0RE90WHdsV3NSa2dZSFE3MHFuLXFDT3BRSEQxd2xBYVcycUdXUWZvZWhXZUgtYk9NcU9TdnB1NjhXR3QtOHpPMGxyYzRGbGFPQml1QkxQWEE9PQ==

indeed most attacks in the wild fortunately are very very low effort and unoriginal most of the attacks described by researchers that make it to the popular press are very hard to practically exploit note that ive said most not all this seems to fit the above which doesnt mean that some versionvariant of it wont be widely used in some short years sometimes they open a door and lead to something practical again speaking very generally as in you should worry about the trivial stuff that nobody reports on probably not the exotic things that often get lots of attention,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZXFuU2hVWnA3cEZpTWdTODZjVHJTMk1DX1doT0lEU1FDclh6NWpNQWVMd3dZcEU1R2hTOGw5Y2dKbUtOTkdwWURkLVROYnJaYlJHcmpYU2xiMEVkdWc9PQ==

so with mitm imagine two people john and mary are talking over the phone however two phones are not directly connected to each other they connect through a series of servers that are relaying audio signals from one device to the other like a big relay race going back and forth john simply assumes that what hes hearing is truly what mary has said however there is always a possibility that someone controlling a server somewhere in the middle could actually be changing what is said so lets say evil mary is intercepting the call john thinking hes talking to mary but is really talking to evil mary hi mary how are you evil mary talking to mary pretending to be john hi mary how are you mary thinking shes responding to john oh im okay evil mary to john oh im okay but can you send me some money to evilmaryhotmailcom so evil mary is intercepting the conversation on both sides and relaying messages back and forth sometimes changing the message with manontheside evil mary sits next to the real mary at work she hears mary answer a call from john john hey mary can you tell me where i should send my bill payment mary sure one second evil mary quickly shouts from nearby before mary can respond further evil mary send your payment to evilmaryhotmailcom john thanks hangs up the phone mary okay send your payment to billingcompanycom so manontheside is basically where the attacker sends their own response before the real response comes back the person waiting for the response accepts the attackers response because it was first and then ignores the real response as just bad data that it didnt ask for this can get complicated because more and more internet communication is requiring a secure channel eg https where an attacker wouldnt know how to properly encrypt the response and the attacker needs to be in a position where they can send a response before the real response comes through,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabElCSHgzbkw3Zmt2alE1eWVIanBGMnlCWVhDSFNCN3JMTE9qYzdPWlBjTmtacG5qekpOY2J1Zk5jTXhYNjllR1RfNWJ1SUtzTlF1SlpwSlVqTjMyZ1JqUmFtempiT3ByVW5JRW1aSmJHczQ9

you can use compromised hosts ive had some problems with people not liking the ui for upload scripts but theres tons of random websites that arent closely watched and have exploitable issues you can then add a file upload script or add your ssh key and transfer things that way ssh has a compress option c btw then since its on a website people can just download it through a vpn irl people tend to use stuff like file sharing sites a lot but those are much better for small files alternate but supported protocols can be useful in exfiltrating files around firewalls like sometimes people completely forget to filter outbound ipv or udp or protocols like that ipv is supported by ssh and lots of networks these days if youre just moving stuff from your network to another theres a protocol from the bittorrent project that i thought looked promising that synchronizes folder between several machines quickly and with the ability to download from multiple places at once i mean theres open source software for pretty much anything you can think of,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacGFxUDlpNkJkTTYxZG5CRmFvaldwTXV4QUZBQ3JCUDRia0gyYTJQc1A1MHplaEpreTk1b0pzRlpRY3JVeFhWRU00NUJUeHFlblc0S21fcW0yRm9lSXNsOU5Zc096YlZQWWx1ME1VWUx3azg9

there was a really good youtube video i saw recently showing from a to z how some russian hackers found an exploit in a router i think i cannot find it but maybe someone here remembers they won some money i think for the exploit it was a recording of a computer screen and the russian dudes commentated everything they did and why it is a really good way to answer your question if we can find it,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU1FwdVdlS0k3U0E0X0ZrUnJyc3JIOWVTd0ZvYnhYdl9VMVFJSkZZRGVad2FIbHg2WjI2UEhLTHBnc1VWd01OM3VodXpEWXNKZnRjU3dUekxFNXppRWc9PQ==
from what ive heard specialization is the way to go its a competitive industry so you want to carve your niche get really goodknowledgeable in a specific subject like cloud or mobile devices as you said for instance and put it on your resume anyone can learn a little about everything but that doesnt mean they can do anything useful this is even more relevant today where ai will start to be used in cybersecurity inevitably in automation of the most basic attacks someone who only knows the basics isnt smart to hire if an ai and a bunch of high school students with time in their hands can do the same if you master something youd be the person who helps develop the ais proficiency and would be the goto guy for whatever subject youd be someone to keep around there are lots of people who know this and that but there are only so many people who know this specific thing and everything about it as for the blackhats and the actual process theyre just a different side of the same coin a traditional cyberattack involves only one vector and only one main payload if youre getting access into a web server you need specialization in that and only that if you only want to extract data from that web server you need expertise in just that you only need to know what youre going to use and the basics usually wont get you there unless youve got fourleaf clovers coming out of your ears all the famous blackhats specialize in specific kinds of hacks whether they be social engineering or privilege escalation or what have you usually youll need to know a couple things but not all of them to be an effective hacker there is general knowledge you need to know basic networking for one but specialization is basically the mark of a hacker as you said theres too much to learn someone who knows everything would be unstoppable but would also have to spend decades learning those in the field and those who mess around in their free time both learn but its likely neither will ever learn everything especially because of how fast the industry evolves tldr hackers specialize because its better for getting hired and better for running meaningful attacks and learning everything isnt practical or efficient,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabmhhYkNoQWNsZzlmd1B4dXZFa21wSnNxQVpjZ0JmUG1XeWliQTJKWWd1RVhvMWdfNU1ZQWFFOGJLSVZ1dTlXTGlVNTYzV3ZxV2xsTkVYQVJrMXlMWU1OT3c5cmNCX2ZzQWhwdndzNDJaSGc9
you start off learning as much as you can about everything getting good at this and that and just experiment overall people usually tend to find one thing that interests them more than other stuff such as reverse engineering making tools some people just are good at social engineering this is usually how groups are formed person one is good at one thing person two is good at the other they may know a bit about each others work but not on same level as someone who focused on only that for a while sometimes you dont have to specialize at all there are occasions that do want you to know a bit everything,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacFJLT1hmSVVVVkVDWC1QbUNRcW9jQmo5NG9oY0RjMjRfdGI3VnF1OTcxSkFsS1lOSWQ2RVk2QnVyVmwzLTd1cDdHNi0ya0RESDNZNjZlTGlJX0VENUE9PQ==

the daily dot has had behind the scenes information and contacts about multiple hacking crimes its very clear they know people involved or know how to get in touch with them why isnt the fbi prosecuting the same reporter who is publishing all of the hacking as an accessory to the crime for withholding the information from the outside it looks like the fbi is coordinating the hacking targets and thats why they arent investigating who is doing the hacking there arent a lot of other believable explanations for the fbi not investigating an extremely obvious lead with firsthand contact with the criminal hackers,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnV0x1cVgzYmlPdVZvTFVtdDdxR1oxRlRGclNSM1Uyc3RIZW9UQUY5RnY3M2E1QW02VDNacjhvbThKRzh3OWkxV3dSOElKTEV6RWpVblFiT0dETjJ6eUJBbDdpV2pndEgxVWZNRk9xN0Y1NWs9
its called reporters privilege they can be compelled to testify before a federal grand jury in limited circumstances but they cant just be arrested and forced to speak it doesnt work that way that being said i doubt the dailydot has enough of or the type of information the fbi could even use no reporter has published the actual hacks why would they be an accessory,r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYlNPV2FzRzM5U285NEs5RncwT1hWOFZPc18xdERORnNYNHZwNFY0RnF6ZnM3TFAxdkVha0J5RDRiaDlRSEZaaVVyTXJJQ09GTkNGWDVsQy1kdnRGQVE9PQ==
