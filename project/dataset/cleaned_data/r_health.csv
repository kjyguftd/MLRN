they added an exception to a law that was written in the early s to prevent members of the ku klux klan wearing masks to hide their identity as they paraded their racist agendas they added an exception to the rule during covid for health reasons now they are striking through that exception and making it clearer that people cannot use masks to disguise themselves when they are causing trouble by protesting blocking the roads committing crimes or for otherwise nefarious purposes there is no intention of enforcing the statute for people who use the mask for health reasons it would be highly highly unlikely for somebody to be charged with only wearing a mask and if by some reason that person was charged for only wearing a mask the prosecutor would not prosecute the case and if they did a simple note from a doctor would be all the defense that person would need and then the state would be out an awful lot of money for harassment and violation of their civil rights the headlines surrounding this law has been unnecessarily clickbaity bring on the down votes,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcEFBNnBVWlFWTS01Rm1LbDcxUVJQeVlBWWdGbUtXQTZoZDJsQWZpWEZqYmRldW4tWEdiVmJFTmpSOC1KbE5ab3FPNzZwOWhHb1d2ZUJWY3BXa0FEZG90VnBmMW9aaU54bkhWRmtLX294cVE9

which is why i said in my post that the intention is not to prosecute people who are wearing masks for medical purposes the intention is to stop people from wearing masks to disguise themselves for nefarious purposes no prosecutor in their right mind is going to prosecute a person for wearing a mask for medical reasons and again like i said if it did go to prosecution a simple note from the doctor would have those charges dropped and then the state would be drugged through the mud and owe a lot of money for interference of someones personal civil liberty rights the intention of the law is to stop people wearing masks to disguise themselves,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWEUySXdhWXpORFdkYnZlQk8tRVhCQTZCQjNhRnFvemJ6dHlBT1UtQUVKcTdvMmNqRDJHWlBCUzF6M0JUaWhMdW9Tb1BMTVhncnFqU0cxN1h4ZUIyMVhhZFZ2ZXNKcHVTNUc5MEFYWVRYdDA9

yup there was also a study that said that fats and oils break down plastics faster so things like mayo and olive oil also have a higher rate of garbage in them weve started to learn canning just so we can grow a few things ourselves and put them in glass instead of pfa coated cans and plastics plus it just tastes better its time intensive for a day or two so prepare for it to be your weekend but it also allows you to bulk buy which does end up cheaper long term for example we made about ten cans of stew for a total of <cur><number>can another thing we do is roast a whole chicken and freeze the meat in portions shredded is great for breakfast omelettes chicken salad sprinkled on a regular salad in your mac and cheese etc plus we can then boil the bonesskin etc to make chicken stock which we can and store for other recipes im going on a tangent but seriously if you have the time growing and canning in general are fantastic tastes so much fresher than store bought cans and saves you time cooking after a long day oh also if you can veggies you can use the scraps for a compost heap to help fertilize more crops we dont have a lot of space but there is a patch behind the garage and a patch in the front of the house we can fit a couple planters weve got green beans and squash going three sisters method sans corn the beans add nitrates to the soil the corn or pole give the beans something to climb and the squash keeps weeds away with its broad leavesand saves space grown together,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN2o2REo2R281T3Z0OE1JaGdKQWsyZXZ1Ri05VEpvWUgyTENlOXFrWE1haVdEbENEdUQ1RE1laGNoNXF1Y0ZwdTBkX0VwMHRQZHJMYnpNTDVFRmZvaXc9PQ==

living in a place that seems prone to once in a lifetime events and prolonged electrical outages my gas stove has basically been a lifesaver for me and for others i know with theirs having a means to cook food during an electrical outage or disaster is priceless while i think more regulation around gas stoves eg require exterior venting may be a good thing i dislike people trying to legislate away the option for a gas stove and dislike others arguing against other people having them dont want one dont get one ill take the infinitesimal additional health risk for peace of mind,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVk0yNkRxNWptRk85N1hXanl0czFoRHhmaW1ENUg1OWxuSEJuaTFuNnM0QUxnSVFPenp0Q2Y5Q1IzOUlUSjBNaWNlWjBYdkVvT2tERC1pQUUyMFVKRmc9PQ==

the modern industrialized microbiome has already changed a ton in the past <number> years when compared to indigenous peoples microbiomes all over the planet microbiomes are <number> inherited they can be altered with diet and probiotics and then inherited again that way evolution can be small and happening all the time there are bacteria that eat plastic so my curiosity is could we take a probiotic that eats plastic or could someone just happen to naturally have one of those bacterias or have a bacteria like that evolve in the gut and pass it on to their kids,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN1pGUEgzT1g1TEJJM3dPTWFpdzlhZ0t6VzBKM1NYMm9WaWVaOU81ODVfSTZyRXREUEl6VTFZMVlTeTVUNHByTlZFYTE2eWp0dEh5ajBFUlFaQUkyUndBdGJrX0ZqdDRuN29vejl1dDh6WDQ9
your comment got me thinking about bioremediation there are scientists who work with bacteria that eat plastic they think this bacteria only naturally evolved since we started using plastic if such a bacteria evolved outside the body surely one may evolve in the human gut at some point in an individual i dont see why it isnt possible the microbiome is quite sensitive to what we eat also what if we could ingest this bacteria or if scientists could genetically alter it to make it a safe probiotic to take or something if it isnt safe to take already or if it wouldnt survive stomach acid or something genetically altered it to survive in our guts that would be risky obviously though microplastics in our bodies seem risky too,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSHRZU05VYTZtZTNLeURNRm1sWmFVa0l0X3ZBTEVYMVNjeFdmNlplSDRCZW95ZlJGYlZrUWNxcFV4VjFGMEp0bjQ0UkdWRjR1Ym8yNTZYZW5RSjN0WUJwZGJLYXgxMGV0ZTlpSUxmRkVVNVk9

its linked from the article i just skimmed through it its summarizing metaanalyses which compare people eating vegetarianvegan diets to everyone else they specifically exclude studies that mention other diets like the mediterranean diet they specifically exclude interventional studies that might answer causal questions so its asking a question i doubt many people interested in health actually care about are people eating vegetarian or vegan diets healthier than the average nonvegetarian unsurprisingly the answer is yes are they healthier than diets which include meat and are designed to be healthy or have research to back them like mediterranean dash mind etc not addressed by the study are they healthier than high meat diets like keto paleo etc not addressed by the study if you switch people to a vegetarianvegan diet does that make them healthier than doing nothing or switching to another diet not addressed by the study im sure the study is competently done but its hard for me to imagine why it was written it seems like a forgone conclusion to a useless question specifically designed to use only the weakest tier of evidence in nutritional epidemiology,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSUJmUG5Mb2oxdTEzU1YyaHBkNXE2RnNTdWpRRGRYTnc3VDh1M3FEZWdDNGtVRzB5dHVCaGN0Y1k1VHZMenZhNGJOQjNmUkVVT3F2SW9SamZlcF9odS16YnlfMnlOLVBoY3hINGVKbWNnZzg9

i saw in another thread here that maybe my comment above is being misinterpreted this study being weak evidence does not imply that the overall evidence for plantbased diets is weak as far as i can tell its very strong some plant based diets are probably as good or better than the mediterranean diet<url> in addition to saturated fat there is emerging evidence that animal protein specifically may be worse for longevity than plant protein due to its amino acid composition and reduced igf hormone response to plant protein fwiw i am personally moving my diet towards a wholefood plantbased diet though its challenging with a family that doesnt also want to make that dietary shift i am a nerd who reads a lot about nutrition but im not a scientist or md so obviously my opinion on what the overall evidence says should not carry very much weight i think my comment on the study in op being weak evidence for plantbased diets would probably not be controversial among scientists though i could be wrong,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUQi1CcmM3RG5naGFYaHQzRzFQNHF5UTNyelZ2Nl80TTZfRndISzR6ZjRZNGpJWXFsU1pRbmV5cVdNMFFNbzRiYmVzdmI1OWgzTE5oOTc4b2U4SGpraUlISTZqS1ZKUDBYQ0ZNc2dET0lpWjQ9

hard to derive anything from this because it doesnt show study designs im also assuming these were self reported studies and diets were not controlled due to the bad wrap red meat gets most health conscious people avoid or reduce intake meanwhile the average red meat eater is probably eating far more ultra processed foods theres a big difference between someone eating mcdonalds cheeseburgers and fries and someone that eats a grassfed sirloin steak with a side of broccoli and baked sweet potato the point is that there are too many confounding factors to draw conclusions it would be far more interesting to see a study of a group that eats something like a strict paleo diet or something of the like where they are eating natural and organic and compare that against the general population,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZ0llcFFHOVEwMDYwNHlhamREU3BmYWprTlZMMXNwS0xINVlDdS1hQjExLXkyYjBEZXpabmthYXA5QkRlc3RIWi1LcWtqV2hzWktkMm8teXNlTHhvWEE9PQ==

mounjaro mostly imitates the gastric inhibitory peptide in people who have insulin and leptin resistance this mechanism has been desensitized and this is why its so hard to lose weight once you have diabetes your body is death throws fighting to make you eat leptin is king of satiety and if its not working right ghrelin will come through like a trex and make you feel like you are actually starving to death regardless of the amount of food you eat when you take mounjaro it docks more insulin which means its ready to go so when you get a simple sugar blood sugar spike it comes right down then it helps your pancreas to produce more insulin to keep the second spike from the complex carbohydrates lower this lower blood sugar keeps you from experiencing the roller coaster effect which can make everything worse when you get your blood sugar down eventually you need to make less insulin and you insulin sensitivity slowly begins to get better insulin blocks leptin from binding to receptors in the brain telling you that your fat cells are full this is why when you fast you can go indefinitely insulin goes down and the leptin your fat cells produce tells you that you have plenty of energy stored oxidative damage from insulin resistance also damages the smooth er in the hypothalamus that is crucial for hunger signaling pathways gip also binds to a receptor in the gut that tells you that you are full for people who are leptin resistant this will be merely baseline for someone who is not leptin resistant they might feel very full and sick this is why its hard for people to agree on the matter it is perspective for those who are sick this medicine is life nobody hears about the food noise the borderline schizotypal thoughts of food mounjaro fixes this this pause in hunger gives you the ability to get your eating habits under control and you begin to naturally make smarter diet choices as you only crave nutrient dense foods and not filler the combination of all of these things gets your hormones back down from superphysiological levels and allows your body to heal your blood sugar comes down your insulin comes down the food noise stops the addiction goes away its a win win anyone who has tried everything and cant seem to make it work should really give this medication a second thought the reduction in insulin allows your body to use the circulating fat in your blood so it doesnt make multiple laps around your body and get the proteins oxidized making oxldlbad ldl itself is not bad it is the primary energy source of the body when we are not dominated by insulin it is the constant consumption of sugar and insulin spikes that keeps it in circulation long enough to get damaged if we just fasted we could avoid so much circulatory disease diabetes obesity nephropathy neuropathy macular degeneration lipidemia and arteriosclerosis they are all diseases of high blood sugar and high insulin you still have to count every calorie on the way down and earn every pound it is not a free ride if you are sickand most people are though it will change everything,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVUUdCdFpnUXUtOU93bFNEamNNdng0c1E4MFY4X0RxcWlwbWVhUTZlcmpnNkY2UXV5RExiZU1VRmM4WHdPeTkwd0xlMTlzSXJTT0JZcTNrYkxleWJGdFhaVEFkSUI1SWdsX1NHcVlkZElMWGc9

processing removes substances and compounds that help to neutralize other compounds in those foods for i stance the fiberbran in wheat helps to slow and reduce the absorption of glucose from the starch by having it removed you get greater glucose spikes that you wouldnt normally get fiber doesnt get as much appreciation as a filter and sieve against certain nutrients and toxins as it should and is rather shoved in a corner and branded as something g that makes you poop larger,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVclBzM2FyNEdPRDhleU9kNGRNaDlsVzFJeGI3azZKenhCbk4zbk12V1o2RXZma2VPUDExeVhfU29pY3p4czQyNkxCT0txcEZ2Yy1wVTUtOXV1WEtQS1E9PQ==

definitely people should absolutely have mental health care provided for them as needed and in this context a good physician should at least be able to figure out what each person needs their recommendations could be helping someone reconsider their relationship with food but it seems to me the majority of people who are obese are not extreme cases in the sense that its the outcome of trauma or hormone imbalances if that is the case they need individualized treatment plans but i think and i could be wrong the <number> or so of obese people arent especially mentally ill or suffering in that regard whats changed isnt the people its the food around us unless somehow we have more incidents of trauma induced food addiction now again i could be wrong so if you have specific data ill take a look but youre right people are now surrounded by terrible choices but i do believe on some level even when its hard a person has to decide do i buy a <number> liter of coke or bananas and kiwis and drink tap water i get it income is a major factor thats why i fully support basic income subsidized healthy food restaurants as common as mcdonalds and taco bells etc but i do believe that we cannot remove personal responsibility from the equation no matter how hard it is because on some level i dont want to teach children that they cannot control their emotions and desires we must teach them how and help them make smarter food choices and change the environment fundamentally all schools need to have healthy nutritious tasty and hopefully local food but we still need to get people physically active reintroduce national fitness programs so all people can be strong and fast and fit even if theres no gym around almost everyone has access to free workout videos on youtube you can do at home basically anyone no matter how poor their diet could reduce their caloric intake but it will not be easy and many will fail and thats why im absolutely not opposed to ozempic when a physician given a proper assessment of all the factors has determined that for this individual person this is the best decision i hope that came across as sensible as it was in my head i would never blame anyone for a food addiction but i also would not absolve them of their free will to do something about now robert sapolsky would say they dont have free will so who knows,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVaUNJRk4zUjk3b3N3LXBMYmwzcmp1eE5HOGkzZ0dKMWNHcmRlV2pWTFFlWDEtaVNuSTk0czRmT2g3cV8tS29kZ1E1cDN1UVJGN1hIWmxqSjlYODNMRVE9PQ==

work and life itself was generally more physically strenuous and physically demanding for the majority of human history most peoples daily lives also revolved around the procurement and preparation of food in addition to all the other physical labor necessary to survive food was less plentiful but arguably more nutritious and had so much more fiber which is also filling and regulates blood sugar you dont have to physically work as hard for daily survival anymore and also a lot of us are tied to desks as you mentioned food has become comfort and solace to many due to isolation from various causes over the decades food is oftentimes a bandaid for emotional neglect as well not to mention the us went from starving during the great depression to incredibly wealthy by the end of world war ii and all the trauma that ensued from that basically led to the beginning of a nationwide binge eating disorder i was also always considered skinny and underweight so my grandparents would constantly encourage me or even make me feel like i was doing something wrong if i didnt eat twice what i wanted and it led to bad habits and obesity for myself,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSzMtZTlmRTRwcVNXSFlNUE15OEFxOGk2RkZBZzNMcm9aS2cxbWNNbkQyN2ZhUG9GbWp3bjlQX0ozSlBka0VmY0Q5NGh4WGJmUzRRUksxUm1sUWVJd013dXptX0JLd2lkWk54c2xfNUh5cTQ9

brother my original point was proper diet and exercise prevents obesity proper diet = minimal processed junk sure some people may not have access to healthy food in food deserts but that is not the case for the overwhelming majority of whales with no self control at the grocery store or discipline to exercise,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVbXcwMW5qdWJVdDZxN3FranNSek9wWHA2NGgwNUlmMDVqTmJHaGZCNzczanR6OEZMc0NIRWtOWnhGOXJwd0Z4NHdmX2xubE9meEhlRFNaWWYyOUppcWc9PQ==

adoption is crazy expensive too and from what ive seen people who were adopted dont appreciate the decision being seen as some sort of last resort fostering can be a very different commitment because there are usually biological parents involved with rights to the children that theyve traumatized and that youve grown to love thats too much for a lot of people and i dont think people realize how much of it is not only this huge shift in your plans but for many people its also the first time they feel like theyre body is really not cooperating or betraying them you think you can rely on your body until suddenly it falls short and you cant that can be devastating in and of itself,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVV1pERW5oRG03NldHOWpmNG84VW5nSWc4M29KTmR6TzVwdlVhb1JnNzFETE5TWF9hZkdtV0J4VThDRW1fY0FqR3pLZDRrU0FObThtWmd5YTFyeHZZMHc9PQ==

i dont disagree with you at all still given that the goal of anyone trying to have children is to have children it seems like a logical next step if you want babies so badly and cant have your own via whatever method then adoption can be a valid and fulfilling way to achieve the dream of becoming a parent i think thats where a lot of people giving that advice are coming from adoptionfostering isnt an easy nobrainer answer to infertility in any way however hell having children regardless of the manner you have them is not a no big deal event in ones life there are no easy answers when it comes to stuff like this,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVY0pNQ0h0ZGZEcEhKUFY3NDhhT0VpUG1YSGY1QnYwbFlraGNwcS11WDNwV24yT013Mk44VXlnQTdNVU1WYzFWdmxNTk5HTDFYQ3d4Nld3U0FDdUVVdGc9PQ==
those people do not understand the reality of adopting there are virtually no infants babies or even children under <number> that need homes and that that are available are usually profoundly disabled and drug addicted older children are much more common but they also have substantial traumadisabilitybehavioral issues most people are not experienced enough to handle a child with that level of need ive worked for years with children up for adoption and i couldnt handle it id also probably be turned away because ive never parented a child foster care is not getting a child it is being a temporary home for a child being reunited with their families or other relatives im not against adoption but its not the experience people seem to think it is,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVaWFXVTNOclVsUFh4RF9mQkVQMldfUE13Rjd6TUlzV2xEYjFuZDdCY3ZnU2E1VE9RZG8taDM4cm9pV1ZxSUlNSTc2ZkY0eVZmZmlpNmdUc09SZzM5Tnc9PQ==

lol this is the dumbest shit ive ever heard people are obese because they overeat shitty quality ultra processed food and are lazy as sloths they arent completely to blame as society has shaped them this way but the answer is not feeding kids powerful drugs with unknown long term side effects sick of people always needing the easiest way out that in and of itself is lazy,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVLWJJY05ES2d2bjk4eUVqN3RtWmpXVmhuTDZGWjNBUkZZbVN4VV9TRDZsR2M0RDZ3N0RVRXU2UmlucEF3RGlsMDFBeE1KNmFraW1SeUdtV0YyU3E2ZVE9PQ==

edit for the guy below me whatever bro this applies to everyone not just kids secondly i was an active kid and ballet dancer that gained a ton of weight through <number><number> even with a healthy diet and two weekend sports i was allowed dessert once a week vegetables and protein for lunch and dinner and ate the same lunches as my classmates turns out my underactive thyroid wasnt diagnosed by doctors until <number> years later in late high school after they kept calling me lazy and i was bullied constantly even though i was walking everywhere in high school always trying to figure out what was fucking wrong with me sometimes the healthy eating doesnt fucking matter and you end up fat anyway edit and you know what if your kid was gaining weight and they were active and eating healthy i bet you wouldnt listen to them either youd push them harder,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVOUpPdmR0SHByQzU3b3QyUHBlc3EyNEpsZjhscVppUktHOE0zZUNSTWFWNk00empHQnFjNFRSbEFHM3FpSkx3Y0VFUTdIS2loemtGS3pSWDVCaElYRkFyZWQ1UGZxTWc1X3RjV1JDS1FwLXM9

i agree like i said it is not an easy answer to infertility i think people who tell someone dealing with infertility issues that they can always consider adoption are wellmeaning they want to be supportive and help that person but clearly that statement is only a show of support and caring inadequate or inappropriate though it may be adoption is a completely separate thing from trying to have your own kids for some it is an alternative for others it is not and thats completely valid in and of itself,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVc3kyOXk0VEp4TDNwWktmWmdzWnFNRHY2NWJDQ2Q2TDlmb1c1R2YtT1BwUHFrZUhJbGVuTVExQUU4Yk5nQzNiVzUzS1lRU3cxb0hyLS1LUkkybm5helE9PQ==

i would just like to say while cold water immersion therapy is still in its relative infancy when it comes to clinical data there is robust data about the benefits of heat specifically saunas even as far back as archimedes eureka as well as the lesser known but frankly fucking valuable knowledge that specific intervals of heat can render people temporarily infertile but much more recently we discovered the potency of heat shock proteins for thousands of years people have been using heat to treat various maladies and even your own body uses heat fever to kill pathogens not only this but unlike icebaths and cold water plunges saunas and hot tubs actually feel good i think the whim hoff stuff is intriguing and i also think some of it is woo that is the nature of scientific frontiers but that doesnt mean we shouldnt have open skeptical minds a closed mind is not skeptical,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWSVA0QXdKVmlxV0QzX3poVEJpbTBGdWw4RWhGR1h6XzlicHVJeEVJMzR2dnpwamt5S3FZYnNQZGhFYmxJLUU0ajlKNXlsU3JULUQzd1c4ckc5ODM4dXc9PQ==

exactly the brain drain will have knock on effects where residencies in states without such restrictions will become even more competitive the residency programs in the restricted states will either have those who ideologically agree with them or folks who couldnt get matched to programs in states without restrictions some of the latter may delay residency and try to match in an unrestricted state the following year this happens already with some who have difficulty matching for reasons beyond their control and not due inherently to their ability as a doctor so many use that year to do research etc to improve their qualifications and be more competitive the following year,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWRjBScy10dDdkOEJKc250R0p3UWxlZWFnQkVKY3AyblJTd20tLXFRQ0p5QjdWU0xucGcwdEFKeFNrbVlCMVB6SV9DSlJVRVAyMTZzY1ljWS1JT05zTmc9PQ==

im not sure what you mean by starting from a space of deconditioning but <number> just being aware of the literature can help motivation why should someone invest calorieseffort into something that they dont know will work rhetorical so when people see the research they know that their investment of energy time attention is worth trying all research on how exercises prevents cancer dementia heart disease stroke risk etc quality of life improvements and mental health treatment etc <number> acceptance and commitment therapy identifying your valuesvalue based goals and attempting to live in line with them most people value good health fitness strength delaying gratification etc <number> most people want to look more attractive and exercise can help with that id bring this up as a motivation with friends but in this day and age where its controversial to propose that someone whos athletically fit might be more attractive than someone whos morbidly obese id sadly be wary of bringing it up with patients people are digging their own graves with reality denial all over the place one way to get to this organically would be to ask people about their own goals and if that comes up great <number> imagining the outcome how good youll feel from having achieved that first k or first strength training session etc <number> behavioural experiments noting down how you feel what thoughts you want to challenge what youre going to do to challenge them eg i feel <number><number> depressed right now i dont think that exercise will help me at all but im going to force myself to go for a run and then see then after note down what happened and rerate emotions eg i feel <number><number> depressed now im surprised at how much better i feel and how easy it was <number> emotional schema therapy getting people to gain insight into how they perceive their emotions eg when we feel depressed people often see that as unusual unique to them unconquerable permanent when depression is normal can be overcome and very temporary etc <number> combining it with desiring to achieve skills that require exercise eg i want to be able to climb x i want to be able to do x martial art i want to learn to do x dance i want to get good at x sport etc those are just a few things,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiWDI1UmFJZ09adFUzVEVVdWt3a1J0NzlzN1ZCdlA5OUNzWDQzZE05QzgzSjI5Sl9wQW11dWhuZVVSa19GQUtmMWYwcmVORWIzLWxVcGpGVkllWDd5WHc9PQ==

doctors wont order them though young patients get blown off thats the real issue here doctors only care about statistics its more likely a person doesnt have cancer so they make that assumption and tend to stick with it because the person is young statistics are not useful for individuals but doctors skipped that part of school this will never improve as long as we keep expecting people to basically diagnose themselves before going in the point of a doctor is to be the expert yet so often people get fucked if they dont fiercely self advocate by fiercely i mean getting nasty i work in healthcare getting nasty seems to be the best way to open doors as much as healthcare workers hate it its a result of their system if something serious is going on its get nasty or accept the death sentence they literally kill off the people who are nice and just accept what they say so shouldnt be surprised when its nasty people left,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJia29USVZKVFdGLW9YX2UzNTktYmRDVXBGTnYyd0hoeHhOVWxhS2tuNzJaeXdGS1BtZWhZMHNQTEFnTkVVTkhmTTh3NWxMb2FoVGwxMTVMVS1rX3pBR25NM2MwNWJ3T3o0djlPSHh5OUQxLTQ9

why would they want workers sick is this a kanye thing the reality is probably simpler if you are producing food then you want to sell more than your competitors and reduce your cost to increase profit so the food you sell should taste better not spoil be cheaper to produce and be easy and comfortable to consume if you optimize against that you get the food we have today,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjX2UxRzJmczZyTkFuQ3BBd0xSUU0tYkFlOHlDYnlvaW41QnljM3o4MElERHJ2cHZJb1dfeXRWemNfS2NTVWR1MkVVLWR2NzkwejJsSzJvYUR1MWo4cGc9PQ==

im not sure theres much of a scientific description for upf foods you dont have in your kitchen is typically part of it or processed to the point where it has no nutritional value whos able to examine their processed bananas to determine it has lost all its nutrients those descriptions are literally foundational to the term upf and i agree with you its as silly as the omg you cant pronounce it argument im fairly confident any association of upf with negative health affects can be better explained and categorised by how balanced the diet is andor specific negatives like trans fat i dont think the term upf is useful and i think it brings with it too much collateral,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbTV2U3I4N09XNl9QSXZueHo0T241TWplbUZmSzdNb3dQOHpqVW9nczFWSjBXcmVxano5NTgyWFoyMmkwdi1kUnN1bkNmN3RGRTdmaHgwYlNnZy0xVEE9PQ==

its the seed oils and breading that often accompany meat in the sad sugardiabetes hypothesis postprandial lipid metabolism initial stage immediately following a meal on the carnivore diet which is predominantly fat and protein with minimal to no carbohydrates there is an increase in blood lipids from the digested food known as postprandial lipemia secondary stage as these dietary lipids are metabolized and cleared any remaining lipids found in the bloodstream would then be primarily those released from body fat stores and not from the food itself insulins role in lipid utilization constant presence of insulin in a typical diet high in carbohydrates insulin and blood sugar levels remain elevated more consistently inhibiting the effective use of these released lipids as they compete with glucose for cellular energy usage the lipids circulate indefinitely in the chance they will be required potential for lipid oxidation because the lipids remain in the bloodstream for an extended period due to persistent insulin and glucose levels they make multiple laps around the circulatory system and there is an increased risk of these lipids undergoing oxidation contributing to the formation of small dense ldl particles which are the atherogenic particles these particles also stick to the walls of the arteries where they were damaged by the glycation effects of high blood glucose and high blood pressure at the vortices of arterial branches it is not the oxidation of the contents of the lipoproteins that causes the dysfunction of the ldl receptor but the glycation and oxidative damage of receptor proteins on the surface of the lipoprotein carnivore diet as a metabolic strategy reduced carbohydrate intake the carnivore diet minimizes carbohydrate intake thus reducing the frequency and amplitude of insulin spikesthis lower insulin level may facilitate greater and more efficient use of circulating lipids for energy potentially reducing the risk of lipid oxidation and the formation of harmful ldl cholesterol in addition to reduction of inflammation of the arterial walls utilization of stored lipids with lower competing glucose levels lipids released from storage adipose tissue are more readily oxidized for energy which could contribute to better lipid profiles and reduced cardiovascular risk as they may not even make more than one lap through the circulatory system as opposed to an indefinite lazy river of fat which is more probable to be oxidized given the extended time period in circulation if supported by empirical evidence this hypothesis could have damning implications for current dietary recommendations particularly for individuals struggling with metabolic syndrome insulin resistance and related cardiovascular diseases hosts of chronic degenerative diseases and ailments will be cured and we can openly promote the proper carnivore diet that our species evolved to eat,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdmdjczUxbDk3UnBmRFBJOG9iTnJ1OEtrSnBpREdYZ1UtSmRpdF9lT0ZYTXFXaVRCYXNGeW9BZi05WExZYVphbHA0VjJ2Rk95SzVJLWFBSXRDaGRLVzVGeHpoOGRRR3hDUldZUVhIY0ZDTFk9

im in stem but not medicine so theres a lot i dont follow in that paper it is an association at this point but a few things for a potential carcinogenic toxicity situation id expect dose response and thats not what they found we found no evidence of an increased risk with a larger total area of tattooed body surface on the contrary we observed the highest lymphoma risk in individuals with tattoos smaller than one hand palm thats odd and interesting this doesnt surprise me unmatched analysis was suggestive of a higher risk associated with having blackgrey tattoos only irr<number> <number> ci <number> compared with having both black and coloured tattoos irr = <number> <number> ci <number> idk why but black work do seem like more ink i have a number of tattoos and they just end up putting down more ink with them than when theres color but again im defaulting to assuming a dose response when they are reporting they didnt find one how about this business the irr goes up significantly so the association of lymphoma and tattoos if there was laser removal laser treatment for tattoo removal seemed to drastically modify the risk of lymphoma among tattooed participants who had undergone laser treatment the relative risk of lymphoma in the matched analysis was <number> <number> ci <number> although the estimate was associated with a wide confidence interval because of small numbers when we retained more data and performed an unmatched analysis the estimate indicated substantial effect modification by tattoo laser removal irr = <number> <number> ci <number> but the confidence interval is pretty wide which makes it less precise than the previous associations interesting results but a big study group they pulled out various people for various reasons and added in controls in ways i dont understand i do field biology not people so this is early stuff maybe someone else has more insight,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVlV2ZHRBdW5vNjc1TnBqaUJRWmhZZThfM3IwUzJCeXcwNFpTa2RZcVlNT0dvUUdUSTEyY2xpd19lbDVrUXRfUU1KMmRRbzV5QmxLQnlwZkhEcHJ3MXMxamZ6YjBBdHdCRFJ0WDBKN2I3STg9

that is the case however reading the article heres the important part the patient was a <number>yearold man with a <number> history of untreated type <number> diabetes tldr the guy didnt control his sugar and he was on his deathbed suffering from neuropathy and renal failure and the only way to save his life was a kidney transplant that they werent going to give him because his sugar was out of whack so the cure basically was to reboot some pancreatic cells requiring another donor so they could manage his insulin levels correctly im sure there was a discussion about carbohydrate control ive had tons and tons of type <number> diabetes people tell me they were cured and dont need medication anymore their diet is <number> meat and vegetables and the second they have a slice of pizza they spike thats not cured its well controlled now in this case you basically could undergo a transplant surgery that could actually correct your diabetes insulin response but its going to come back if you dont control your carbs promising but not a panacea unless we can somehow grow those cells outside of a human body so that a donor is no longer required if that were the case then it would be simply a matter of giving insulin resistant patients an injection once a year or so,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVmEtclRURHpkSFRUVkgwYzd4TnhCNG9UOGdtREY0NmM0UEZjVUxlTEloeWJ5SHBhNXk5bGV5Sl8yanhIUHlBekg2NXZXZHg4QXJZYjJvVUlBb1RNMEE9PQ==

ive looked into the safety of tattoos before and what alarms me is how little research has been done in general much less research that demonstrates that it is safe its crazy to me that so many people afraid of medications and vaccinations are willing to inject ink into their bodies without a second thought coming from someone who has a tattoo and isnt against them but i also take a boatload of meds and get my vaccinations from what ive read theres very little of any regulation of the j me that go into tattoos even in countries where regulations are in place theyre rarely enforced,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlaDNycXc5MEZMa2xOdUtiTGY0dGRaR0x0UWVrUjU3WUtydkxsM3JTWUNRZXdxTEg3dTFXb2dzX1phaXJ3dlZZLTFNbVYyalgwdFcxd3FyUXBWYVBWNmc9PQ==

blood glucose is a nutrient required for all cells in your body too much can be bad for the cell of cells so many organisms have developed a way to balance out bg with this protein insulin diabetic people lack insulin producing cells therefore get huge spikes of bg and can die from this in the long run most treatments on the market for diabetes is regular injections of insulin but some people have devised ways to replace all the missing islet cells so that regular shots are unnecessary this group used stem cells from a patient turned them into islet cells and transplanted them into a patient in the hopes to replace all the dead islet cells the person saw a decrease in blood glucose indicating insulin was being produced in their bodies likely from the engrafted stem cells they monitored them for many weeks and saw that their blood glucose remained down for the most part,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJla1lFRUZ1Y09SbGZpVTNXMFcta2FXMVBZVDZIWUxkYktKX0pNSVVDdFNOUDhBRFNYc1g3U01zclUyQk92U1VRQVhRSzZheVdRVDdJWEFuOHh6TEFOaGc9PQ==

from what ive read this article included its more than the skin being affected ive read about it being found concentrated in lymph nodes one of the studies i saw was pretty horrific because the lymph nodes needed to be removed and the woman had gotten the tattoo around her vulva this article is now talking about lymphoma related to tatto ink which is a cancer of the lymphatic system anything injected under the skin has to be sterile even a little bit of bacteria on your skin before an injection can cause problems so its no wonder unregulated ink could as well tattoo reactions of the skin dont seem to be that uncommon dont quote me on that but those are the visible ones where its easy to pinpoint the source as being the tattoo iirc yellow and red inks tend to cause more acute skin reactions but black inks might have the most problematic ingredients overall,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNTF4WkUxbENXaTQ1N2EwckhmbFpZMmZjbkJFdzkxRlBzYnlqbTNaLWYxZnNNdHdsOURHNWJnb2xhWTlBME9Rd0xTVWxZNE16UFl1Rm4ybHVoZzNCRXc9PQ==
> that we were this close to fixing td what was done in this paper has been done many many times the difference here is that theoretically because it is a patient derived stem cell there shouldnt be an immune reaction to it the key is making sure the graft stays alive and isnt targetted by the immune system td is much more complicated by time you catch a young person dealing with td their islets are usually complete destroyed there are some amazing ongoing trials targetting td though currently there are a handful of fda trials ongoing for looking into transplantation of islet cells this study will likely be looking into stem cell derived grafts others have simply taken healthy grafts from other sources most of these trials have failed there are also a few trials that suppress the immune system by deletion of certain cell types that cause disease this is promising for graft survivial but leaves the patient compromised to infections there is also at least one trial ongoing that trains your immune system to stop reacting to islet cells via a vaccination because your immune system is no longer reactive to the islet cells grafts are much more easily protected,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlcmR3UDFnRWVLYUtuODcxREdxb2h5eGJybWpwZjUtcjBCTFVEQ2FvTS1sLVBUZVVQd195bkpGWWx0RlNhNUVKWTljRl9TVkZUYjdZcUNmbG5oekZvaGc9PQ==

in the article it says the results are purely associative and i will cop to the fact the headline is may and not a certainity however what gives me pause here is that tattoos are an extremely old art practice and if there was a noted rise in cancer following them then surely by now we would have observed this on a larger scale although everything can be framed as causal to cancer i think it feels like a leap to frame tattoos as unsafe as they sort of do in the article anyone can observe cause and effect and the causal relation between tattoos and cancer hasnt been evidenced over the literal thousands of years tattooing has been a thing this study shows an association but you can also associate drinking water and death interesting research but way more would be needed for me biased have tattoos to cop to the idea that tattooing needs to be considered unsafe,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlckhCQldrRGlUVFlUSUpoOUs2R1lHd2plRDNWOGtwWTBWNTZ5d1Y1SVBoOVZ5UXozZm5CZGwtOXFhS2NpYVJwNzhaNHAyS1V5MUx2dHlNTlNnc25oX2c9PQ==

slightly higher risk with all black ink tattoos but maybe meaninglessconfusing because size of tattoos regardless of black only or color had no direct effect thats what dose response means you should see increasing risktoxicity with higher amounts of ink if the ink is the problem when clear dose response is absent its a head scratcher it tells us it might not be the ink thats the issue maybe tattooed people who get lymphoma have something else in common or lots of other things all these folks are from the same country for example for some reason laser removal of tattoos shows a stronger relationship to lymphoma cases someone else said maybe thats because laser treatment breaks up the ink and allows it to enter the bloodstreamlymph system which is a good idea that could be tested none of this means anything at this point its just a study not a controlled trial there could be other factors that explain what they are seeing that arent what we are thinking at all time and more studies are needed study we look at data after a bunch of events and try to draw conclusions vs controlled trial we randomize and control the things that might be messing up the one or two questions were trying to answer we do studies first to develop ideas and help write grant requests to get money for big research efforts and controlled trials best i could do explained like youre <number> or a smart <number> year old ,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSVI2Uy1HZGlUeXI0SkZtem5abWZxMm8xdS1qMnQ1V3BldzZOamJoak5Vd2ppTkJWWWRIR0dqUl9GTGxpYWVqNmUyX3N0dGE3eUtfQ2Y5aXp3OFpzWGQyY3BRZUpHYXdqMEZrWnlmVVZXNkk9

its interesting i would like to know more about the other relevant factors there are so many health behaviors and living conditions that contribute to cancer risk and tattling is associated heavily with lifestyle and social grouping i dont see any way to fully adjust for those so this is counfounded af at best having said that <number> is a huge increase percent changes like that are very rare in health sciences i do think its creepy that tattoo ink turns your lymph nodes black there is a plausible pathway but unless you use an rct and assign people to the condition of tattooingnot tattooing it will be impossible to fully disentangle causation one more thought i think the lack of dose response and greater risk with black and grey supports the idea that there are confounders at work as in those are stylistic choices that are more likely to be associated with other lifestyle factors and health behaviors maybe im speculating but i think it points to the idea that it isnt just a physiological pathway at work here,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMDN2ekw1Q0I1bXNfcF9XQm9tYjYyckpMak83bE9sS0NJbHZSSUtpdTRDeUVlbHNjV0JtVmYyejZVVjd0Z1BXVnl4OWZGTnF5TjIwbW9yTHZ5TTJoaGlESkxrN3lSajFMcWZyQzNiaW9wOVk9

i agree id love to see the sample stratified by the age of their ink by square inch then by lymphoma risk to see if age of tattoo itself or changes in ink makeup over time might have something to do with it pretty sure ink formulations available in <number> were likely different than <number> also depending on where people were tattooed stratification by where the majority of tattoos are on ones body do people who have tattoos directly over lymph nodes have more lymphoma how do those people fare with laser treatment and i think youre also onto something that perhaps there are confounders between people who choose all black work vs people who have color and mixed work tattoos that may further bork results lack of dose response speaks loudly here a few specific statistical tests might clarify it,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQTlERlZMNTYxREs1bHVpZE5HcUZ2SzhiUDladDh2SWM4YmNoa1RtcVdZb09yamRXeGRrcTlYeWJzRXpuVmozOVZOQ1NYSlRsYURHMDF6OV9mSWVmeWJ6c3lldDZ0ZlJnSnFFVnJtRlRHWGM9
thats a big part killing birds is presumably to decrease transmission between farms and chicken houses why not cattle though probably money broiler chickens are slaughtered at <number> weeks anyway egg layers take <number> months to lay but can be replaced faster than cows and have a value of about <cur><number><cur><number> each dairy cows are <number>+ years old before they can join a dairy herd beef cattle are killed i think right around that age at maturity i havent checked prices in a while but used to be cows were <cur><number><cur><number> apiece for average nonregistered beef cattle depending on age and gender killing those is a bigger financial hit and a cow gestation is <number> months so replacement is much slower its financially worth it to try and nurse a k+ animal back to health whereas farmers generally immediately kill a sick chicken to try and prevent spread of diseases,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWnQ4TFJPdDJEcTNzWXBiX1ZpNVp0R3pHSXFXZm9ON1pvVExTdE1fczJtM2FURmtjcEszU2h2dloyR0otLTNtYnY5YnBTMzZKUC1NeXBUTXF3UXV5Unc9PQ==

the birds do not need to be in contact with each other it can be spread through contact or other contaminated surfaces a major vector is droppings that contaminate workers shoesclothing and are introduced to the poultry farm that is why bio containment measures are extremely important for any poultry right now including all small scale or backyard poultry as for feeding the dead birds the proper protocol is to compost or burn the culled animals at this point the usda is stepping in to monitor the culling process i cant speak or iowa but unless they are running some really unscrupulous farm practices its not going to end up in dog food or cow or the grocery store,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWE9UdDd3VUExZ0g5UUd3ZHNyMC1HcFpBVC10OENYbHMtWWtPa1c5TFV3bGlpQ2pNdVVMMXp3bThrSlgyYTVpREsyYngzT0V5UHRXS2l0MGNZUHZZSHc9PQ==

remember when michelle obama wanted to promote healthy eating for children and people lost their damn minds this is why it has been trending this way for a long time stop feeding your kids crap and encourage them to be active you can blame whatever additives you want but the decision to give the food begins and ends with the parents parents are responsible for researching ingredients and healthy habits start at home is it easy no but raising a whole damn human isnt going to be easy and you need to be willing to put the work in for it to be successful the people responsible for raising kids are always the parents not teachers neighbors extended family or media no more of this it takes a village or my tribe crap a community is meant to aid parents not replace their responsiblity,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMkt5WS12MXdrUnRyWHRSTFo1NFU2dGRFeDhYV290bHJ1RFFqRXp6UC14UG5QUWZnZzBMYkptWlV4QTZ1NHpZeVFab3lXMGZzelF0alY5dFA3d0ZDX3c9PQ==

there are a few reasons to support before breakfast brushing when you sleep you dont excrete as much saliva this allows harmful bacteria to multiply and thrive at a much faster rate than during the day waiting to brush means that bacteria sits in your mouth longer and will continue to multiply and excrete it then feeds on the breakfast additionally brushing right after your meal could wear your enamel and brushing before breakfast not only removes that bacteria as soon as possible but stimulates saliva that keeps bacteria at bay and provides a protective coat that prevents damage from acidic foods and drinks like coffee on the other hand simply waiting <number> min after eating to brush your teeth youre able to effectively brush off your breakfast the harmful bacteria from the night before and start fresh for the day either way is fine pros and cons for both if one wanted the benefits of both a simple solution is brush before breakfast then rinse with a nonalcoholic fluoride containing mouthwash after ie act therabreath or vice versa not a dentist but i do the former because im like you and want a fresh start lol,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZDQxdjB2WkZkb3hUUld1TDlJdFRzMWdmSm5lOGhkQTVGXzNtRHBFMXMtSnVQTmlmekI5b2tTdi0zV3Bhcl9xdXh1eHBvQ0RZc2wxeXl6Q3NkRERaZi1XQWx0ODk2b1l6TkVQcW4tMGhQNzA9

ohhh i see thank you so much for the info re brushing after eating wearing down enamel i wonder if the texture of your breakfast food makes a difference i usually have something very soft like eggs or bananas + protein shake for breakfast which are very quick to prepare and get eaten right after i wake up is it simply the act of eating anything at all that wears enamel or is it the assumption that people might be eating hardercrunchier foods like cereal im having a hard time trying to think of acidic breakfast foods maybe fruit salad with citrus i never have citrus in the morning for medication reasons anyway i do like the idea of protecting my teeth before coffee and all of that but the thought of eating or drinking anything with a mouth full of minty flavour makes me want to gag i might have to search for some flavourless toothpaste  or maybe something bland like vanilla,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQTJSOWlwcmRBMml6LVFWMC1TbVNUQTk3d3d3Y0txUzVtTzF3WS1DazVnM3F2VFFnMUZTQVRScjhLMTB3eEE0Z0ZMdm1KRlJoREhRbWZoT3EzbmpPcWc9PQ==

it works until the healthy food is expensive we do what we can to get healthy stuff cheap we have a csa that we are a part of we split a cow with a neighbor we trade farmwork for eggs and other benefits once a week seasonally dependant strawberries beets etc but the bad stuff is so much cheaper than the good stuff especially when your kids have texture issues and reject rice eating beans is more expensive than it used to be by a lot so without the rice filler its rough add in dietary restrictions for medical needs and its brutal when a loaf of bread is <cur><number> only reason we are able to do all of that is that we cant afford daycare so i had to quit my job and i am able bring the kids around with me everywhere to get the cheap food and help stuff and we were able to invest in a chest freezer if i was part of a double income household there would be no chance in hell that there would be time to take care of all of that in my case i had twins first so i didnt have a whole lot of choice about being inundated with the cost and all that it absolutely is on the parents to do responsibility but we are so much more alone than our parents were the average mom in the s parented for <number> hours a week average dad <number> their dad parented on average <number> hours a week the current average parenting is <number> hours on top of everything else the numbers for a village have to give somewhere because we dont have them anymore and its all on one or two people in a lot of places now so the it takes a village and tribe stuff isnt just crap it used to be common and is now rare in the us kids have to be allowed to be in public to learn how to be in public but it is being forced the other way around now and its rough i dont know if you are a parent or not but it isnt as easy now as it used to be my parents would drop me on my grandparents every day for hours and i would only see them at breakfast and dinner their parents would do the same but now generally that isnt an option for most of us because the grandparents have moved to more affordable areas in their retirement or have lost their goddamn minds and are not safe to be near kids unsupervised this isnt just a parents thing it is a society thing that is too tired to be a village when we are all working multiple jobs to scrape by,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQk9KSEluRS02SWlBR2EtM3ItUmRNT1NCc1Npd3VyS3F6T0h3ZDJoTXlVc3BKLUtuMjd2OENfelBVXzRHQUxYUkFlWVJDOFVJaGY3d0cxcUxpdlZKeEE9PQ==

okay im going to get in the weeds a bit about cattle feed farming broiler litter being fed to cows is most likely not a vector or how bird flu got into herds possibly but very not likely boiler litter is rarely fed to dairy herds its fed to beef cattle those types of cows do not have much if any interaction with each other obviously there are caveats but for the most part its beef or dairy farm not both broiler litter is used as a protein bulking supplement dairy cattle eat more grainsgrasses to make energy to make milk think carb loading dairy or weight lifter beef since the biggest out breaks have been in dairy and not beef cattle that would point to another main entry point im in a state that is currently experiencing a number of dairy cow herds with bird flu broiler litter cannot be fed to lactating cattle dairy cows and it must be pasteurized to be able to feed to any cattle state law pasteurization has already been shown to kill the virus it would be nearly impossible to have broiler litter be the source is using chicken poop and the stuff they sit in as cow feed absolutely disgusting sure is the use of broiler litter in the news is most likely a case of this is gross so lets blame bird flu on it if anyone is concerned about broiler litter being used as cattle feed you should avoid buying grocery store meats as much as possible often hard to track sources and cheapest meat sources go to a butcher most of the time they know which farm the beef cattle are coming from you can ask the butcher and get the name of farms to look up their practices if youre able buy straight from a farm if youre on the west coast look for beef raised on california farms because all broiler litter as a feed is banned most states have some kind of regulation when using broiler feed youd have to get that info per state which can usually be obtained by searching cooperative extension offices and those can be found on the national institute of food and agriculture website and also you can pressure politicians to make laws against using literal shit as a feed source,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmSkZlZTlEaFNFaHY5QnE1RXNsdm5GbTlqY1NBSHAzUExFSWZlVGVOblkxNUM3enZjQU82WGowMGRnVnAxQlpNeWNCX0h5enVkWFBHajJjeW5OQlFGV2c9PQ==

a lot of infiltrating drugs like this are basically just hyperpotent synthetics theyre easier to cross borders and ship higher potency = need less physical drug to get high so smaller shipments which are harder to intercept can be less definitively illegal new synthetics or drugs used in other capacities like these in vet medicine often initially have less stringent laws against them which also lowers risk for dealers they can also end up being cut into known drugs basically what contamination is often to add more of an effect to a more expensive drug thats been watered down or even if it hasnt or they can just be sold + further additives to bulk up and sold as a drug they <number> arent most of this cuttingadulterating is happening without any testing and by people who have little to no experience in chemistry or pharmacology obviously they also dont know exactly the potency of the original drug theyre adding and may not know if its been adulterated at a previous point in the drug chain so basically you get blind mixing of drugs that can very easily be too potent to the point of toxicity or even mixed with other toxic materials,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsUGZBZVRRZ1VoQUpDa2JSdi02QWdGRFUxUXpUOG5Jb3NIdldaUE9MbVhDYTdTdVl2ejh1eWl0VVJpckZybUNOZGo5VjRDU2xib1htMEMxall2YUo0aWc9PQ==

the real answer is that unless you have something like ibs or crohns disease it really shouldnt give any major issues it doesnt for me and it shouldnt for healthy people problem is most americans probably dont have a healthy diet and then it might easy to get unwanted effects because of things like a lack of fiber eg eating enough vegetables fruit or whole grain products fiber really makes stool firm if you dont eat healthy and already have loose stool it might make things worse but the magnesium will not be the actual cause most likely for your body to absorb magnesium in the gut it needs to be bound to something called an amino acid magnesium citrate that was talked about is generally decently absorbed and it doesnt give that much issues some people might take the cheaper magnesium oxide this indeed can cause issues in high doses thats literally used as a laxative i dont recommend taking that its cheap but that might cause you to poop more because of the way it interacts with the gut take magnesium citrate or magnesium bisglycinate and there should be no real issues most actually dont get enough magnesium and thats arguably the greater harm here,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtWDk3Ym1rRUR6OU9Dc2hkM2pmRXhpOWtmVGpUMTlLQzlFR0U3Zklwb3JNYjl1c3dEOENnel9ubVhoc1VSR19nSVl0S1VvWFNvb0ZjbUJqb1JrNXhHR3c9PQ==

sounds like it doesnt matter how many or how much your body is covered once you get one youre done honestly im considering getting another tattoo and this study made me nervous but i also might just go ahead and do it because the study seems to suggest its the act of getting a tattoo not the amount or size that causes the immune response which in turn causes the risk you could have a tiny tattoo and may as well get a giantass one even after reading this study if ive interpreted it correctly tldr people into tattoos even if unnerved will probs still get more because theyve already reached the risk,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJteUgtQnlCUFFHRVZVQUxHd1BwTVBwNTBIQ0pWUXpBQ3RoWS1iQzFIU1J0a0RPV2JERnF3OW05cmVwOGpLMTdvazVlR1pjVUtBSVZaOFdiNDBlckxaMVE9PQ==

i would say it is also the most fraught with peril in a good way the ai will start coming more and more to the fore and the hard work will be sorting through that mess if you are going to do biotech you may as well get used to pair programming with ai and get used to validating outputs because dna and viruses and vaccines are all inherently circuitous and chaotic since it is all just the accumulation of billions of years of weird transcription errors not unlike a machine learning programs output may as well learn both simultaneously since you will be studying both outputs regularly either way messy dna and chemical structural algorithms are not disimilar from messy machine learning algorithm outputs the way forward for humanity is i think for humanity to use machines to amplify our understanding of ourselves and to reawaken a passionate love for our humanity,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZFRaNlRHamJCS2RoSWNOVGJwc1NNZVVMS0NrcmQ3TWRhLU8yYzF1ZlNpSUVBbzczdXRGRlEzTk1LVkdsX3JlbVQyUUVYT1FYVlRtYWdDTVpDeW1oRVE9PQ==

there was gain of function research on coronaviruses happening in wuhan with collaboration and funding from nih the possibility of a lab leak was and is very real and would have been very damaging to nih fauci and other key leading virologists involved so fauci and others took control of the narrative early on and called speculation about a possible lab leak a conspiracy theory and criticism of his actions an attack on science now fauci and other key players concede that a lab leak was always possible evidence is being uncovered that they deleted records in an effort to hide how they coordinated their efforts to shape and mislead public opinion to me it seems scandalous and investigating further is necessary to strengthen the publics trust in science,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuU2JJSXY4aDUtSHpXalZXdV94VXZzc0p4SThGeDhfODdBQTdUX3ZiRHNqM1pSZTBWUXRuWWFhVFVhRGxzeDFhcFN2OGlySDl0ZXptZ0pLTkJleklEclE9PQ==

you probably dont make money on the tests you make money jerking the patient around forcing them to come to you over and over again for those short visits that you get paid to do nothing for them and tell them to reduce stress and if they dont come back to you again theyll go to a colleague of yours its a disgusting greedy scammy system now if you believed the patient in this case and told them to go do tests you would have to think you would have to spend more time with them you would have to do a google search or maybe even consult a colleague or two you would spend more time and effort trying to help the patient and you would not make more money for it but if you treat them like how <number>+ doctors do you and your colleagues would make more money the patient would suffer but you guys dont care about that,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSmJYb29vS0hxVlhEX1ZJVmVzdWpvdWc4VEF5Y3ZNaTZlVlZkTnBESHc2VGo4dEk0YVpPNUJ5M1laRFNjUTN3U2ZrOS1kSzNTczI5NGw0MnJUcmgyOEd2ZDYyWEplQWxHbXBkMndaUV82Znc9

my contribution to this thread is as follows if you have this condition and are trying to quit eat foods that are low fat and low fiber when you quit most of the reason why the vomiting occurs is the slowing of your digestive system i recommend mashed potatoes if you can use another antiemetic like promethazine do so its night and day the difficulty in quitting when you dont know the correct food to eat i was initially diagnosed with gastroparesis after they did a gastric emptying study because no one had ever heard of this before about <number> months after the diagnosis i read the white paper on chs and i just had to know so i quit after <number> weeks i was eating whatever i wanted with no issues again when trying to quit i cannot stress enough eating foods that are low in fat and low in fiber i would even recommend eating as little as possible the day leading up to and the first <number><number> days of quitting it is a night and day difference in how difficult it is to quit stay disciplined in your diet for that first <number> <number> weeks after about a week you will start to feel quite a bit better after two weeks you might be able to start eating mostly what you want i hope someone that is trying to quit reads this and it helps them,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvc2s0dm9fZUw4NDdGeUI0djNUU0EtSVpnSVo4bFBNaWtpQ3BjYjl1VmVwVmhEb2FCUVU2RGhvLVVfOWhJVkhrY3hIcXBWejVhcGZyYU1EdTk4U21FSlE9PQ==

i mean yeah but what exactly are you debating here bmi itself is badwrong or that the way all statistical data is compiled is badwrong because bmi is inherently really not any different from statistical data the numbers on their own are fairly worthless and can even be used to spread misinformation whether by mistake or malicious intent statistical data require context to discern what those numbers mean and even then it doesnt tell the full story bmi is much the same way it wasnt meant to be this all encompassing utility to be able to accurately depict a patient individually on their own otherwise providers would not ask you your family health history or medical history questions because in an ideal world all that data is used in conjunction with data such as bmi to plan for what might be needed if the patient has been struggling with high bmi for over a decade and seem to have respiratory issues youd get the bipap machine for said patient even if they have not had any copd issues in the past everything is to help narrow it down no data in healthcare on their own is perfect and generally you need multiple confirmation on diagnostic tools to confirm something bmi is nowhere near the same line of thinking as black people have thicker skin its an objective measurement of your mass and height the problem with bias today is doctors are spread too thin and dont have time to sink into a case as deeply as they should so they see bmi and just make conclusions,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvbTB5VmdYdjAyRi04X3FGY2lQRGRybWFPMXVSWV9Ca3ZHR0U2cWxXNThrSVUyNlozbE9FVzR2SklKbktMeHBROUM4R1RrNGZNeDBYajU3NE5JTnVVRGc9PQ==

so maybe you should go back further and read up on what bmi is its a screening tool your claim bmi sucks is based on the idea that waist to height ratio predicts insulin resistance better than bmi bmis purpose isnt to predict insulin resistance and whr isnt something that should be used by any doctor to actually predict insulin resistance it should be used similarly as a narrowing down utility aka screening tool again absolutely no doctor that will continue practicing past the next year will be making any diagnosis based off of a screening tool that is bmi or whr bmi is not even remotely different than using statistical data or medical historyfamily health history data but people who dont know any better trip themselves up because it deals with numeric representation of data also whr isnt actually that much different than bmi its numeric measurement made from your physical anatomy size that is somehow supposed to give you an accurate reading of how youre doing physiologically what are we actually arguing here other than the typical internet x is better no y is better im not at all arguing for bmi im just rationalizing the concept edit to add closing statement,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvcVlCVGJTRTRxY2lVZkNKWW5zODJsaXlUWkJOMGM3YUhUemtERWRYT1hKeGZ2S1EtWXViSkkwN1VOcUt0MUhXdWpkX0ZXWUhCMWdUVHllM2czdmkzVXc9PQ==
im glad to see a bigger focus on body composition bmi doesnt differentiate from fat and muscle when losing weight you want to lose fat and not muscle mass if you lose muscle mass and lose weight your bmi will look better but you will be less healthy often when people gain weight after losing they replace the muscle mass with fat which puts them in a worse spot than they were if they hadnt lost any weight the focus should always be on building and maintaining muscle mass and losing fat bmi does not take account for that anyone that wants to get healthier should focus on body composition and not worry about bmi,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVTdjNVpMaWt1X3kyeWotamRHSmFSMmlfUU10dDd5WDd0LW9XN1ZsREQxb0JRc0xqNWdGQndudkVkMkN0U0xrZnE5UldaUWZOZTJtWU1ubWJzYXozTUE9PQ==

the problem with discussing bmi online is that people make the argument like a doctor will look at your bmi and decide all your diagnosis and treatment plan based on your bmi when thats not at all how its done bmi is as much a screening tool as is the question to ask if youve traveled out of the country and to where and if youre sexually active this next bit is entirely analogyexamples so ignore if you want when you ask a surgeon saying your so needs surgery or will die and surgery as <number> chance of success but your family dies even with the best surgeon on the team does that make the statistical data of <number> uselessfalse or are we simply using and interpreting the data wrong we are interpreting the data wrong that dead family member would be part of the <number> those statistical data mean very little to the individual under the context that you might be the <number> but the statistical data does a lot in instilling confidence that for average people there are no complications but the individual should be aware that neither are true and people are just making assumptions based on statistics you dont know which demographic you fall under until you undergo the surgery there are factors that can help predict whether the surgery will be a success and therefore the raw numbers of successfailure is even less useful and concrete when adding context,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvU2JmeHF5SUs1VzZGS0pyd1ZYS3FvMTlrc2k3a1ZHV0VjeGczUFRKcVRXTlZxMXFHaXlLUEFMeWVLeE9jQ3dtazYwOUZ1ZVR2SWl1b1hlZjRiRno5Z2c9PQ==

one criterion for metabolic syndrome which is a much more useful diagnosis than obesity imo is waist circumference excess fat carried around the waist is much more dangerous metabolically than excess fat carried elsewhere it makes sense that excess waist circumference is correlated with insulin resistance which is another criterion for metabolic syndrome people with high bmis that have low body fat but high lean muscle mass which is the category that its the most misleading for tend to not have excess fat carried around the waist the higher weight comes from lots of muscle not fat and even the bodybuilders with the biggest abs dont have enormous waists the way their legs and arms get jacked up of course whr is also a screening tool as is waisthip ratio but both would be more predictive of metabolic syndrome than bmi ideally we use all of them since its such an easy extra measurement to add,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvY1lCbTkwNExKeTdjVHlqVXJlaXZCemtaUldkVkhHeUdZOENlVW9HbW9DSDRMek9kY1E2eGJvWWZJWkpiSU5rbGM4c1lhdExHbEdkeXdjTkdGUEpHRkE9PQ==

because large waistlines better predict health risk than bmi does where you carry fat matters with waist measurements you can better detect if high bmi is from carrying muscle in which case their waist size should be in the healthy range if you have a large waist circumference that can indicate visceral adiposity fat surrounding your vital organs which is indeed risky,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZGV6Y3hWQVpKWXVMSHhfVkZwaXV5dEd1a3JhS2g5ZlFPVGJHdS1pdThaWEktOEtFN2FILW13cTdDVWwwZ2ItR0FRdkZpMHF0TWZkeHZQSjdoLVZqWVE9PQ==
cobbs claims poppi does not contain enough prebiotic fiber to cause meaningful gut health benefits for the consumer from just one can the complaint alleges poppi sodas only contain two grams of prebiotic fiber which means a consumer would need to drink more than four poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits however even if a consumer were to do this poppis high sugar content would offset most if not all of these purported gut health benefits poppi has never stated that drinking <number> can per day would drastically change your gut health second you should not be reliant on this drink to be your main or only form of prebiotic fiber three poppis high sugar content they literally contain g of sugar per can whereas coke has g four poppis cans are straightforward with the amount of fiber they contain g fiber supplements are also dosed in g serving size why is this a problem for poppi this lawsuit is coming from a woman who has worked in law for almost her entire career and knows that she is able to exploit a loophole shes found supplements are not regulated by the us whereas foodbeverage is this allows her to create this lawsuit and go after a company that is helping people give up traditional sodas and trade them out for this alternative if youre interested here are some comments from registered and licensed dietitians about this lawsuit pros reduced sugar content in contrast to typical sodas which often contain <number><number> grams of sugar poppi boasts less than <number> grams of sugar per serving fiber content poppi offers <number> grams of fiber surpassing the fiber content of any other soda im aware of potential health benefits though gut health lacks a standardized definition poppis lower sugar content compared to regular sodas could be considered a gutfriendly feature cons not a magic solution no single beverage or food can fully address all gut health concerns a wellrounded diet incorporating diverse fiber sources is essential possible side effects excessive consumption of inulin may result in symptoms such as gas bloating and diarrhea as always moderation is crucial overall while it presents itself as a healthier option to conventional sodas poppi shouldnt be solely relied upon for gut health purposes a note on olipop and other prebiotic sodas poppi may also be a better alternative to some other prebiotic sodas like olipop olipop contains g of sugar and g of fiber from jerusalem artichoke and chicory root it also includes agave syrup and cassava root these ingredients can be triggering to the gut on their own especially in excess but also in combination with one another which is something to be mindful of label reading is definitely important when were looking at these types of products things to note poppi contains fiber a prebiotic not a live probiotic these terms can be confusing to the average consumer i personally dont think poppi is harmful if it means a consumer will drink this instead of a can of coke or another soda there would be a huge reduction in added sugars a lot of kombucha drinks also have small amounts of added sugars however we can have some added sugar in our diets just not too much and that there are other benefits tied to that drink as opposed to regular soda one thing i really want people to takeaway this does not mean you should stop drinking poppi especially if it is helping curb some of your other cravings for higher sugar or caloric alternatives edit spelling wording,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvT0I3UWk5V1dQWlM4dDhOMTl3c19vRnd6U05idVlQTk8wbUd3OXdFTTZOZGljQXhVZXdKUE9ZUWd1UXI5aHQ4SDkyeTFGekFoY1pVeGhhenBHWmUtT0Fqa2VXN3pzSEZPVmVRbENoZ3g2Zm89

yeah i absolutely hate doctors like that i mentioned in another comment of an example where a patient may feel chronic pain and be skinny then when they gain weight the doctor then blames the chronic pain they had to the weight gain and say maybe you should try losing weight only looking at the bmi and then stop listening to the patient adamantly tunnel visioning on the conclusion its due to weight gain there is a reason why i keep telling them bmi is a screening tool and really not all that reliable at finding out whats wrong it just narrows down the search of what kind of tests it needs to run in that sense aka practical sense of how its applied in healthcare its virtually exactly the same thing as bmi its a screening tool and thats my point people are out to criticize bmi saying it eludes doctors but in that anecdotal instance of your friend that doctor isnt using bmi the way he should hes simply not listening to the patient and that would make it user error would it not im genuinely trying to ask people criticizing bmi what exactly are they criticizing and every single one of them has been more about a problem with doctors behavior rather than bmi as a tool itself listen i work in patient care im in nursing i get that im not smarter than a doctor or at authority to dictate whats fact or not but absolutely none of us looks at the patients bmi when pulling up their charts on the emr yeah the info is there and we actively do things like bed scale for daily weights and we do make sure we get objective data for height and such and the emr calculates the bmi for us that bmi is not something that is ever specific or useful in any kind of patient care procedure but say you get a patient that does not speak and we have absolutely <number> information about them their bmi is high so we can naturally run tests for things people with high bmi might have as well as the implications of overweightobesity but absolutely no one is calling a muscular patient obese based on bmi in an acute care setting this kind of bullshit only happens in pcp offices where doctors dont even so much as look at the patient and just wants to get you out the door asap because time is money for them isnt that a problem with the physician themselves not the screening tool,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvR2R3SU40RnhYY0JmcWNGU3FLanNZbnBsU1FNTENoeklDYW1wcGRSYzRDRkl4eGs1ZmFzSm1QSnB4bmRVZDc0RzFkTFVHb3ZhZzlqNnd0Zl96RzYweUE9PQ==

im not against using whr i just dont understand how much of a difference people expect itll make because bmi criticism is that it seems to flag patient for further investigation for health risks associated with weight gain in practice what do people think using whr will look like in either acute care setting or preventative care in principle itll be exactly the same thing bmi does its going to screen the patient indicating them to be tested for x or y health risks since bmi criticism is that its overdone more than it should be bmi will flag more people to be tested for health risks associated with weight gain when they shouldnt be or at least thats the criticism my argument was that its not bmi that flags it its doctors not even doing the bare minimum of their job like observing the patient and listening to them and using the data gleaned from this interaction to make judgment instead the user error made with bmi is when doctors become statjockeys and only look at the numbers and when you got doctors who do this using whr wont make any difference itll bring the same exact issues so my criticism isnt on whr itself its more about peoples expectations out of it its not going to make a huge difference like for example in both bmi and whr case we will definitely have situations where doctor is told the patient is pregnant and will forget about it and conclude they are overweight based on bmiwhr sounds silly but thats the level of stupidityignorance youd have to have to make a deduction based solely on bmi and stating the patient is obese when people are bringing these examples or anecdotes to argue that bmi doesnt work these examples arent proving bmis are bad theyre showing that healthcare workers in question are just really terrible and basically negligent,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvd2g4Y2FkdWpqeklhZmhfUDlzWG5FY21SWUNtT0FpQkVJX2pzbkgwSTFHekNfNXpDS3pIWVdSejJqTDFnOUhyYU1OQ2FIR2ZpUFFSZHBsUFRld0gyQ0E9PQ==

well for one if someone who isnt obese takes it then they are unlikely to get any cancer risk reduction it also means that if obesity is resolved in some other way the same cancer risk reducing effect should be expected since its reducing obesity that is linked to reduced cancer risk not the drug itself the drug is simply a means to reduce obesity with a nice side effect that not being obese reduces your risk of cancer so the headline is misleading as is tradition with health news headlines,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvX29ob2E3c29UbG93SjlxMUpRWlFxYnlGUS1mbjF4eVUwWUotMF8tRk5wQklGalA4bWJPbUU3a1dDZE00LWQxb0Q3OVl0SkJCWnY0Rm1ROF9NUkhlQkZIRmFPMEZJX0dSZkx6Q1JSaTQ5TGs9

it is mandatory where i come from and i took it in high school and in university for my particular field of study i didnt take it in english though so i havent got the appropriate vocabulary please bear with me bmi was originally calculated for western men in the th century a population that was neither under nor overnourished but it is not representative of many populations today im biased here because i come from an ethnically rather homogenous european country so for my population the stats will be representative enough they wont necessarily be so for people of noneuropean ancestry or for women the measurement was arrived at by looking at said population of men and then finidng the normal distribution thats all now by definition the majority of a western male population should fall within the normal bmi range unless they are over or undernourished hence if youre a man of european descent youre unlikely to have a bmi of over <number> or under <number> unless youre over or undernourished you might have such a bmi without being over or undernourished to be sure but you would be an outlier so for the majority of the population the bmi is a good rule of thumb if you happen to be an outlier there are other measurements that can be taken into account as well its smart to do so anyhow but for the majority of people the other metrics will show the exact same thing that bmi shows and then that argument about elite athletes that obese people love to grab onto there are fewer than <number> elite athletes in the world thats not even <number> or sth like that so yeah most white men with a bmi of <number> are simply grossly fat and at a bmi of <number> an african woman might not be as overweight as a white man with the same bmi but shes definitely not at her optimal weight,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bDZuWk0wMjdQQWoteUxMTU9LempxdFUteEJYNDhhZmlMNlhfaGFhWlpCT1lGYVZ5WDd4WU1maC13V0xnaFdCYmNwMmJaTzNOeThDZHp4VmN2MXFKNWc9PQ==

lol what you do know that most of viruses those are known to affect humans are of zoonotic origin and not scary secret labs and that pandemics happened in the past before people even had labs and that similar as with covid viruses circulate for a quite long time before they even get detected there is hardly ever a patient zero that is not how those outbreaks work there can be more than one person who was infected or animals asymptomatic cases for months sources of infection those have never been checked and so on its not a zombie apocalypse jfc since covid most of you have become even more ignorant than you were before ,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2VzBCYjdzWE00XzBKZXM5UHlGa2xVYWg0TVhVbzJ4bXMxYjAtSnN5bHFISUZ2N3lTa1ZrRFFZX1ZMSUFtMzN2VGF2SEx1c3JTQVZ1YUt3YXJLZncwaDBVWHk1TFptLXVNWDgxSG9Qd0tOUFk9

this im a fat woman i gained weight during my <number>s i was also battling severe depression and severe medical issues that werent caused by my weight but significantly helped increase my weight due to the disease process limiting my ability to move and the steroids i had to take to control it im finally in a place both mentally and physically where i can even begin to give a shit about my weight intermittently they the decade there were time i literally did not give a damn about my size because i was so physically miserable dying earlier sounded like a god send im just in the last couple months got off the steroids and able to move better i dropped lbs just coming off the steroids without changing anything i can no longer move nor have the same energy level as others due to my diseases but the catch is you cant tell that by looking at me you cant tell i have a plethora of medical issues and take <number> prescriptions a day just to stay alive and half way functioning and sadly none of those will go awayever and i would still have them even if i had not been overweight body positivity isnt about embracing being fat its about allowing people to love their selves in whatever form they currently hold fat people know theyre fat they dont need anyone telling them that they are yet when they go into society society shuns them like theyre a leper and its the <number>s again all fat acceptance really is for the majority of overweight women is to be able to be in the world without some jack ass like yourself saying shes fat if you honestly believe that that is helpful language towards an individual then you are part of the problem thats causing many to hide from society and stuff their faces instead of going out into the world and living their life that kind of hyperbole is the reason so many do not go to the gym its toxic and frankly its rude and mean as well since all you can focus on is the one video from <number> years ago where she talk about loving herself how damn far did you have to dig to find that anyway just to prove the point that you dont genuinely care about what happened to her but that you hate fat people,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MGxwS1ZNSzZ1TGRxZmxwbmhWMmpzVUxrWEJVQkxGMkcxX2tQZE81TDU2YXhDa19lZl9wYldTTm5INm9vcnpzWUMta2FjYlQzTGVIbzRQMmNfRFVfZW45NTJVQ2l1SXRxNTRIRzNpenlXX009

i think youre conflating body positivity with some weird sort of prounhealthy behavior philosophy that to my knowledge doesnt exist except in fast food advertising body positivity means embracing my shape and size as they are while i eat healthy and exercise body positivity means if im fat i should be just as welcomed at the gym as a fitness model body positivity means i track my micro and macronutrients to ensure im giving my body good nutrition because thats an act of selflove body positivity means tracking my fitness gains in terms of what my body can do instead of my body fat percentage body positivity means eating a healthy amount of food and getting a variety of balanced exercise letting the weight take care of itself as someone of a normal size who has dealt with progressively worsening and now disabling chronic pain for about <number> years i can attest that body positivity absolutely does not mean giving up and diving face first into a pie it means learning to love myself despite no longer having societys ideal body i was a bodybuilder and thats no longer an option ill be <number> in july i need to practice a lot of acceptance and self compassion around how my appearance is changing as i age this doesnt mean im telling people who are younger that they should look old like me and it doesnt mean im telling people without chronic pain that they should go out and develop some chronic pain that keeps them from their sport but it does mean i have a choice to approach the way i think about my body with positivity or negativity i can tell you negativity and selfshaming do not inspire me to take any better care of my body the body positivity movement allows us to be kind to ourselves as we are while we take the best care of ourselves we can its not telling everyone to be obese lazy gluttons its about telling everyone health is for all of us and we are not going to shame people in larger bodies pursuing their best health outcomes,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MDI4ZmNQRFdXZTZYdUxHd2VneGR6cDU3RXlLMW83YldINXdReG41MC05c0NoZ1FBNW1jMlBWcGgybXpqc200WUI0X0U4M0FPTW5xcDNXRDdGVE1TNUE9PQ==

i mean as long as we in the us are defunding libraries and public education this seems an unsurprising outcome i think the hardest part of having a body is strangers see it as a reflection of worth and character like a fat person must not give a shit about themselves or how dare they let themselves live like that when we have no idea just going out and existing in the world means experiencing contempt body positivity was meant to be a respite from thatlike hey you belong at this gym grocery store wherever and you deserve to go about your day without having to justify your fat existence or apologize for not being thin yet and you deserve to be free from others cruelty regardless of whether youre trying to lose weight,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bnEzMi1EdWVpVWJFOVVjbGxvYXlOS3BCV0J0N2lHVXBsYWp0QThYQUMwbGZTT1VveEp4QUhVNVFxMy1tRWJoTGlGendBUFBzYy1FNVVlUWp3N3lUVnc9PQ==

these numbers are wildly incorrect covids mortality rate globally is <number> dont downplay its severity mortality rate varies by location and method of measurement so those numbers change based on those factors but no measurement puts it nearly as low as less than <number> that is flatly false mortality rate for this strain of bird flu cannot be accurately determined bc it hasnt circulated in human populations enough to be studied yes bird flus have killed people in the past but theyre also not frequently tested for in people with mild to moderate flu symptoms bc of this people who get bird flu and dont develop severe symptoms like the small handful of dairy workers who only got pinkeye and recovered get left out of the data on this virus which artificially inflates mortality rates if youre only testing people with severe illness or postmortem the death toll will look much higher than it actually is thats why scientists are hesitant to speculate on a mortality rate for this strain at this time it should be taken seriously but not to the extent of conflating the numbers this badly or downplaying covid by comparison covid remains the larger public health threat,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cVBkX0p2Tlh0ek9RWFV4RGw3d1drMGVqWTNEZE1lSDh5RWlxLUtRTEtxMmFtdUxFNVdSN1Brelhza2dmaWRkcHNMVkJ2bXhkSVF1WnlGR0pUUUswV3c9PQ==
no it is not because everything in moderation does not follow from the dose makes the poison we know with a high degree of certainty that red meat consumption is correlated with early death from cancer or heart disease and it isnt that a moderate amount shows no risk every serving of red meat that appears as a regular part of a diet shows this correlation you may choose to do it anyway and i do but that doesnt mean that moderation is without risk a little bit of heroin for example doesnt actually work for most people or cigarettes and so on,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VjBEbFppTmJtZGgxeWtoNzlFZXVBOTVFQ2xETzNTd3Bpa3lBejNZQ0xEdEZnZUdweFVGdkJTdUlpYmZYLWQ0WXJDSUFFb2FQQWdyWFlZOFFrbzNCQnc9PQ==

ok you can bully yourself into losing weight but it doesnt fix the issue and often backfires binge eating and not taking care of yourself have deep rooted issues that need to be addressed and if you just shame yourself into being smaller its very likely to be unsustainable very much like what the woman said in the video happened to her body positivity is a helpful way to start combating that by being positive toward yourself so that you can learn how to love yourself which includes movement eating nutritious meals because you deserve to have good things,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3S3Y4RzVyN2hYMnUtLWg4MEJvdlBtcnBsWHZBSmVpUzhLUTNSV1JXTW9RamkxNjI5UlVLUTBqc0JvU1BSVnNqLVFPVl9CQ1pIM3JoSTN5Mm5fcEtLa1E9PQ==

risk = hazard x exposure minimizing exposure minimizes risk even if the thing is harmful for something like heroin there is no safe amount of exposure although heroin is a more concentrated form of opiate and doctors do sometimes prescribe opiates for legitimate reasons in moderation for red meat someone who eats it once a month is encountering less risk than someone who eats it once a week is encountering less risk than someone who eats it every day for most humans it is simply not practical to ask them to completely give up something thats been a part of their lives since they started forming memories we accept a certain amount of risk living our lives every day because we are trading risk for benefits youre exposing yourself to an enormous amount of risk every time you get into a car so should you stop riding in cars how practical does it sound to never get into another car ever again for the rest of your life that would be the safest thing for you to do though and theres no arguing against that,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3RGJYNEVDRTBCTkZDd2NMWnBsb0ZRQmpLYnFRVHNZMjJfYm9pTUk2Yk5sdmxmdmF4Q3pKd1Z5cnZvU0I4a2t6NDBUZU9SV2pmbHhFMS1DV3NtbkwxNWUwS0x2cmNId3pWTGdpVm9ycUJybTQ9

bi agree no one should be making character judgments based on someones weight alone its not just rude it is incredibly poor logic on the other hand body positivity shouldnt make one complacent about their health also i would argue that many entitled fat people label certain words actions and behaviors as bullying or cruelty etc because they happen to have had their feelings hurt being offended doesnt mean one is in the right or that what someone else said or did is wrong or cruel these people weaponize the concept of causing offense as if it is akin to assault for instance when person a comments on their own body and person b gets offended its not the fault of person a regardless of how badly it might have made person b feel or for instance if someone is invading my personal space like on the bus or a plane its not cruel to require that they remove themselves there is no justification for expecting to exist in my space without my consent regardless of someones weight a doctor needing to weigh a patient also isnt cruelty denying medical procedures that are dangerous for people of a certain weight is not cruel either someone being told theyre not permitted to join in certain physical activities like horseback riding or bungie jumping for example because of safety issues isnt cruel its simply the way the world is and its not fair to say that the world needs to change instead of trying to take some responsibility for oneself these are just frequently used examples ive seen im not trying to stick words in your mouth or anything,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ZHB4amx0cF9zS2hBWERkc1VWMWpGZXkydEhqb3pCLXNoazViNzZzakZfSEdrTEpXbWRZWHk3WGpKbHctZGVlaUw4dy1qbVBNWFlNZkUzXzNLbHFsRmc9PQ==

context im a clinical and basic science researcher not on weight and am a skinny person people have such a huge and complex misconception about body positivity there are so many comments here with the tired trope of yeah love your body but you should still try to be healthier the research surrounding obesity and associated health issues is poor correlation does not mean causation for the vast majority of these studies bmi is used as the diagnostic tool for obesity bmi is such a bad maker of body composition that its laughableit doesnt discern at all how fat is distributed throughout the body moreover correlation and association type studies regarding obesity frequently succumb to collider stratification and reverse causation biases since theres such a strongly ingrained view that fatness is bad those associations are primed in researchers minds in reality there could be uncontrolled for covariates that are instead contributing to the correlation between fatness and whatever else is being studied an oversimplified example what if being diabetic causes people to gain weight not the other way around much of the discourse and standard of care surrounding obesity has minimal or literally zero researchbased evidence this is actually the case for more things in medicine than you may think  taking your weight when you walk into a doctors office is nearly pointless as its a poor indicator of overall health save for necessary measures like anesthesia or medication i wont get into the whole obesity paradox finding because im unsure of the verdict some of these studies also fall prey to complex statistical biases but there is a good portion of research demonstrating that excessive weight can be protective against certain conditions and issues ill clarify some excess fat on the body can be bad but it all depends on where it is subcutaneous fat around the arms legs hips abs etc is not generally associated with poorer health outcomes visceral fat deeper in your body around your organs etc is the fat that usually sends things awry in the body the kicker is that being overweight etc doesnt necessarily mean that you have more visceral fat skinny and thin people who are in poor health can have higher levels of bad fat too general weight isnt really as important a factor the problem with supporting fat people but still encouraging them to lose weight is that it can lead to something called weight cycling a wellestablished phenomenon in which people lose and then gain weight back the vast majority of people who lose weight gain it back because weight loss can trigger a considerable stress response in the brain that can overload your frontal temporal lobe and encourage you to eat your body is essentially responding to a starvation response this is unhealthy and damaging much like blackbrown people and other discriminated minorities social determinants of health may contribute far more to poor outcomes in fat people than actually being fat additionally theres some interesting research being done on the concept of a set weight your body may already have a natural weight set for itself and a significant deviation from that weight may cause undue stress on the body the stress of society looking down on you plus your own bodys neurological stress response of losing weight can destroy you dieting is disordered eating and thats disgusting also the whole calories in calories out thing is pointless nutrition labels can underestimate caloric content by <number>+ percent and not all calories are even created equally people also argue that being fat can limit you from doing enjoyable things the problem here is that our constructed world societal infrastructure etc wasnt made for fat people because of the inherent discrimination cant ride a roller coaster try to shift the thinking away from its because youre fat to its because the roller coaster wasnt made for you because fat people are looked down upon people could also argue that it may limit people from doing more natural things like climbing a mountain but being unnaturally skinny can also limit you from doing things too we all have a variety of talents skills and predispositions lets be inclusive and celebrate them you can be healthy and fat if you eat healthily and exercise and youre <number> lbs great if youre <number> lbs great doesnt make a difference skinny people can be just as unhealthy if they dont do the above things theres more to say but ill let this awesome <number> hour video essay<url> speak for itself many links to sources are included there thanks for reading,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3c0pZV0ozVm41dUlydzdrTUxOWUV6UnhQWWxxT1VEVHZzbzNhcjQxd3RVX2pWajk4M0JCZFhOTDA0X3JWV3lSUmVnOG1kekZabGhSU1hyNWtQX29MY2c9PQ==

who said moderation eliminates risk neither me nor op its like saying its okay to ride in cars we understand there is a risk every time you get in a car but you will catch very few people in the us refusing to get into a car or saying that we as a society should not be using cars when someone says its okay to ride in cars its not a guarantee that i specifically am going to be completely safe during my drive to the grocery store i can definitely get into a big accident and die but is it okay to ride in cars or not thats what i and ops doctor are getting at people will see news articlesstudies like this and ask their doctor is it okay to eat xylitol which is when the doctor says ops quote the original quote was almost everything is okay in moderation i think both of us can agree that the almost includes heroin there are very very few things on that level of harm everything else is generally okay in moderation xylitol red meat sugar potato chips cars etc,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Nm52MHpoMXpodWVLTm1kWnRkXzZNM3g4amZEU244V3BMTGZ6UENXcklsMnFpXzhiWUExMkY3ZkRzN2k5aHFmUDB6Z1VrRW5haWhsWFVPVm14dnk2a3BKbGF0YUhiTXdDbDNwMk9NU3ZpdXM9

to me body positivity is treating addictive behaviors with compassion rather than shame which as a clinician you may already know is statistically more effective body positivity is doing healthy behaviors physically and mentally and focusing on health not perfection its saying rather than waiting to be a size <number> to swim at the beach its ok to go now its saying that taking a step toward being healthy deserves respect but if you look online at fat people documenting their fitness journey the reaction is often extremely bodynegative if we as a society make fun of fat people dancing and working out online in the name of promoting health how does this help the typical overweight fitness influencers comment section is full of that body positivity means saying i love my body so therefore i will take care of it rather than i hate my body so i will punish it by working out until i cant walk for the rest of the day or starve myself until i finally cave and eat too much or win the battle and lose the war with anorexia symptoms exercise is good for you that is not the debate the debate is the approach the default mode of western society is to be extremely judgemental of fat people regardless of if they are trying to become healthier body positivity is saying fitness is about health not about summer bodies and healthy athletes are muscular and not necessarily skinny if you want someone to lose weight the solution is not command them or shame them into it you are bad because you are overweight so fix it i am not saying you think that but the default mode of society is to judgemental to fat people and the prevalance of eating disorders especially in women is proof of the pressure on people to look good if you look at this comment section and in general on social media you will see the emphasis is on looks and hatred toward fatness if we want people to lose weight shaming is not the solution and simply telling someone they should lose weight doesnt actually provide any actionable steps to get there this is why health coaching has an opportunity to help in this arena where a typical doctor faisl because they provide a roadmap and encouragement which is necessary not just a demand of weight loss i will share a personal anecdote a few years ago i hurt my spine very badly and could not walk i could not get any assistance with home care bc a doctor thought i wasnt disabled enough because i could use the toilet she was incorrect but i didnt know it yet when i couldnt walk i ate shitty food and i had previously been working out <number>x a week and couldnt do that so i gained some weight i saw a spinal doctor and he told me you need to lose weight i looked down at the wheelchair and said i cant exactly run a mile can i well eat healthier ok bud you try getting groceries put them away cook do dishes from a wheelchair with <number><number> pain and tell me how that goes i did my best but i ate a majority of microwable meals and nonperishable food to minimize my pain i dont know how anyone could genuinely do better in the situation this type of conversation with doctors is typical if saying lose weight was enough then no one would be overweight lol so to me body positivity is ignoring that judgemental doctor and focusing on what i can do,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QjNIV2REYmdzQUhPQW0zNHJZNW9mNWVicncyVWs1ZUd1RzI2X0hfU2JDZFJmdG16N3VMQ0lXMHFNVFBXV0tqQXotNUZ2SW5FTFViZ0k1cXVoUUN2N0E9PQ==

im not judging the ones that fall victim to substance abuse although marijuana has no physcial withdraw and u only get sick from doing it so often im only judging the people that defend the drug as if its ok to use every second of the day much like obesity im not judging obese people im judging the people that encourage it and act as if its not a problem its unhealthy and should be seen as unhealthy  what should we do spoil and enable drug users and reinforce that what they are doing is perfectly fine or should we simply discourage the act of abusing substances that alter ur chemistry so much that u become sick and miserable yet feel like u cant function without it due to ur body physioplogically relying on it to feel better ill repeat it drug abuse even weed is stupid once here and there isnt an issue i eat cake but not often i drive somewhat carelessly sometimes but not that often i eat fast food here and there but not that often self control is lost to us and its all understandable as to why however that doesnt mean that just because its easy to succumb to it that we shouldnt still discourage from doing it and sometimes tough love is what is required,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MzlNRHBxbVNMNnBqUFVDai0tWkpHeWlnek8wdGx5QWNRT2NOOXFQQ0N6NGJxYWNDeno1M09QMWl4OHh5U25nSlVfWW1tR3F4UzdHXzJqT0xpdFZDUXc9PQ==

it isnt only about women first of all and it isnt about health its about accepting a physical appearance for what it is to keep people as equals in society regardless of what they look like what youre describing is more along the lines of fat acceptance which people disingenuously use as a way to say obese people are living a healthy lifestyle people in the public eye who care about or are involved in the fat acceptance movement absolutely use it as a way to justify an unhealthy lifestyle and they actively push the narrative that your weight doesnt affect your overall health which is an absolute lie being obese is unhealthy it isnt an assumption to look at an obese person and know that they are less healthy than they would be if they were not obese obesity is directly connected to every leading cause of death that involves your health also being obese does affect other people and its selfish to not realize that they use up public resources that they would not have to if they were in better shape obese people more often have chronic conditions that bring them to the doctor or hospital more they make more emergency phone calls they eat more foodnot an unlimited resource they are more often handicapped as they age using up parking spaces and things like that they would not be needing if they took responsibility for their health there are many ways that our personal decisions affect the lives of others we dont each exist in a vacuum so its ridiculous and full of lies its a means for justification theres nothing wrong with accepting that we have problems physical or mental and we shouldnt lie to ourselves about it thats weakness not strength i am overweight and have mental health issues but i dont live my life pretending those things dont exist when someone alludes to it i know why and it just makes me think more about how im living my life i dont try to convince myself that those people are wrong living an honest life is paramount and necessary for long term improvement and happiness this person didnt have to die if she addressed her health honestly and seriously it wouldnt have taken her this early in life,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QkJEU01ORkZCTVVZb2pKQk9ZNklyTUpiQloyMklyNVJiRVM0WHcxYm5IYTE3Q0JhRlFXZWpNSEN4cUIxenJBRzBkdG5OeDlYRDFPVW1xdm5PSEh4UFE9PQ==

all this comment tells me is that you dont actually know much about body positivity there has been a huge push since at least the late s when i first encountered it which means its probably been around much longer to reclaim fat as a neutral descriptor there are absolutely body positive spaces that have watered down the movements principles who might discourage saying fat that doesnt make them representative of the movement as a whole fat people are not obligated to make their weight the top priority the most important thing i learned in body positive spaces is that my body is just a vessel i promise you that a fat person is not made any healthier when they are forced to fixate on their size,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3eFVzS2ZzSzNJdFlLVUE2VEc5YXV1RTQwRm56c3F6cHozXzN4XzR4N1BDdEd6RmR4emZpREdkNFo0bjZYQVZ1czN4QXVHRGs3VzlJakFTUC1oQzYtdGk5cjByUHh1bnotTmpPMlBKdVpQN0U9

you keep conflating correlation and causation throughout this conversation i literally said that there is no research that proves a link between reduced obesity and increases in public education but there is an inverse correlation between the two just go back and read what i said and by the way that study is irrelevant because children are a different demographic children dont get to choose what they eat or not if children lose weight because of dietary changes its because of the decisions made by their parents children dont have choices on this issue sheesh youre so aggressive het over yourself why is it so hard for you to have a civil conversation,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NFBFel9IajE5bXFVX2RQZ0ZXQUlwS01QV0F2S05fQU1QdUhPRzF0YVNWYWNPbTlTQnBxWlZscDlQY0ZpWExxeDZfR3JGQ0tXZHBGcDVzbHlBOV8wQkRvdWF2YS1UcmdNejhqUllmR181Z0U9

hey thanks for the response i think youre misconstruing a lot of what im saying calories do matter but i dont think that the calories in calories out approach to weight loss is a useful or beneficial tool because of the complexity of nutrition the variety with which food companies ascribe caloric value to food and the unique relationship each persons body has with nutrient absorption and energy expenditure i dont think its fair to inappropriately overgeneralize my assumptions just like general health guidance which is commonly prescribed and described by everyone this guidance isnt appropriate for everyone if someone is morbidly obese such that it makes it difficult for them to move thats obviously a problem to some degree though i think the relationship each person has with weight deserves some degree of autonomy because its their body and as such we shouldnt reproach these people unconditionally again theres a lot of nuance here as how someone treats themselves can also affect relationships with and the wellbeing of others but blatant hate and disapproval is not the way my entire response was founded on weight neutrality as you even pointed out towards the end of what i said <number> vs <number> lbs i never said that that being fat is better than being skinny rather id say that being fat is as equally morally rightwrong as being skinny it appears to be a much less significant indicator of health than previously thought i never extrapolated my diabetes vs obesity analogy to cause of death that comment wasnt explicitly directed towards mandisa its a very interesting extension of what i said but cause of death couldnt really be boiled down to something as simple as that i dont think again im not a doctor i was simply saying that reverse causation is a very real bias overlooked in obesityrelated research because of how heavily we assume that obesity and extra weight are bad im sorry if that comment came off incorrectly in my first attempt i do not think that my comments are dangerous its important to challenge and clarify them as youre doing but they arent dangerous of course there are negative aspects of obesityim saying that there are negative aspects of all body types and inappropriately emphasizing those of fat people is hurtful and maybe even dangerous too,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VVdaYVl6ZXh5cllDY3RaVC1GQzdmTmhMWk1DMUNLTGUyRGNkelVTbXhpQks4aGx5QlpPWmowY05wZXpDVmRJNlA1VW00cHoyeWRqbWJxMnE3cE9IMXc9PQ==

fat people do not want to be fat making someone feel worse and pointing it out isnt actually doing anything they know they are fat already the least you could do is make them feel a little better about it they arent stupid they dont actually think they are healthier or perfect it just feels nice to be told you are beautiful sometimes and everyone should experience that regardless of weight weight loss is a long and difficult process that people have to take at their own pace society already makes overweight people feel worse about themselves a compliment isnt going to suddenly change that but it might make them just a liitle happier,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3aldRcElHaVFkLTV3aGR3d3ZKN0g1Rkl1cGZ2M0ZCV3ZwV2xvQ0s4bzRuZlZMQV9HdVgwUWJaei1SNzdZemlsaVFBRmNiYlVQMDlaa09XWkJhZWxMdHc9PQ==

i also understand the relationship between weight and jointmotor issues is a little bit different but i would still argue that there could be other underlying factors contributing more significantly to these conditions in the case described above of someone having lower back pain moving around less because of low mood gaining weight and having more back pain why is the back pain immediately attributed to the weight gain theres an intimate and rich connection between the brain and the bodylower mood can contribute to physical pain as well as a reduction in movement overall there could be several other factors to consider as well ive been through severe depressive episodes and experienced worsening body pain without gaining weight there can be so many causes to complex health problems,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MHgyMDAyTzY2WjRkUFh2OTE1OFJFbms2Q2dkYXkwckd6WWlkc2xjbTNXSmt3VVRERFhWcGlac1BhcjkyclprOFJhaHBkNHhIanIxUHB1VHVRWmd2UXc9PQ==

fine i will do it up all night you may have actually been asleep you say you havent slept all night brain scans say you have new science says both inferences may be right byfrancine russo sulukhana boonyarithsriponggetty images desperate for sleep you go to a sleep clinic where your head is fitted with electrodes to record your brain waves through various sleep stages in the morning you report that you barely slept at all yet according to the testpolysomnography the gold standard for sleep measurementyou slept all night youre not the classic example of a person with insomnia who waits for sleep to come maybe checks the clock paces reads and waits for morning what you have has been called subjective insomnia paradoxical insomnia or sleep misperception scientists have doggedly attacked this stubborn puzzle for decades without resultuntil now now they say that you have not been misrepresenting your sleep they have been mismeasuring it the most recentstudiesusing far more enhanced measurement have found that many people with subjective insomnia show different brain activity from good sleepersthroughout the night neuroscientist aurelie stephan and colleagues at the netherlands institute for neuroscience nin realized that something unusual was going on after they asked people in their study to put onto their head a net of <number> electrodes rather than the typical six to <number> used in sleep clinics in oneseries of experiments the researchers woke sleepers about <number> times on average during the night the participants were asked whether theyd been asleep or awake and what theyd been thinking about on supporting science journalism if youre enjoying this article consider supporting our awardwinning journalism bysubscribing by purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today the most remarkable finding stephan says is that these people showed pockets of arousal in the form of fast brain waves during rapid eye movement rem sleep rem is the stage in normal sleep when your brain should completely disconnect from the systems that keep you aware and vigilant stephan says people with subjective insomnia with this interrupted rem do not experience their sleep as restful when wakened they reported having had thoughts similar to those when awakeadding lettuce to their shopping list say or reminding themselves to call their cousin they were less likely to have what university of montreal neuroscientist claudia picarddeland calls immersive dreams in which you feel physically present in the dream world and are fleeing down a dark hallway feeling the hardness of the floor or battling a dragon sensing its hot breath in a study of normal sleepers picarddeland recently presented at thethe cognitive neuroscience societys annual meeting participants said they felt most deeply asleep during immersive dreams which occurred in the rem stage people with interrupted rem as stephans research shows do not report immersive dreams they do not feel theyve slept deeply and they report fatigue similar to that of people who actually sleep very little perhaps even more important says nin sleep scientist eus van someren interrupted rem is strongly linked to disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd and anxiety if two people experience the same level of trauma a good sleeper is probably less likely to develop ptsd than someone with disturbed sleep he says those with disturbed sleep are therefore more vulnerable to developing ptsd its a vicious cycle this occurs because interrupted rem interferes with the overnight dissolving of emotional distress that has accumulated throughout the daytime which typically happens during good sleep sound rem sleep is the only state during which the brain has a timeout of noradrenaline norepinephrine van someren says the neurons are not firing anymore so they dont release noradrenaline downstream in the brain but if you have even the slightest arousal from rem sleep then noradrenaline shoots up very fast he believes those with interrupted rem experience this arousal repeatedly and never reach the typical quiescent state that allows for the processing of troubled emotions astudyheaded by van somerens former graduate student rick wassing now at macquarie university in australiademonstrates this experimentally the researchers exposed people to a distressing emotional experience for three days in a row they had to listen to a recording of themselves singingoften out of tuneto karaoke which aroused shame as measured by their physiological responses normal sleepers felt less distress after a nights sleep those with disturbed sleep felt more the percentage of people with insomnia that have interrupted rem is unknown but these insights are suggesting new personalized treatments for insomnia which is now understood as existing on a spectrum such treatments may be especially beneficial to people with insomnia who also have depression and anxiety disorders currently cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia cbti is the standard intervention for insomnia people with insomnia learn to decrease their anxiety about sleeping and to employ behavioral strategies aimed at better sleep but cbti does not work for everyone those with interrupted rem in particular probably need different solutions one behavioral strategy used in cbtisleep restrictiondoes show promise for people with interrupted rem however some sleeprestriction methods involve shortening a persons time in bed to the average amount that they actually sleep per night other methods delay a persons bedtime for example if a person objectively sleeps for <number> hours the experts allow the person to be in bed only for six hours a preliminary labstudyin which participants delayed their regular bedtime by two hours showed that such sleep restriction can reduce the number of arousals during rem the researchers are hoping to replicate these results in a larger study of people sleeping at home this new science also opens the way for drug interventions the nin group is seeking approvals to test whether a betablocker typically prescribed to lower blood pressure might mitigate the effects of continuous bursts of norepinephrine the researchers are also considering testing the blood pressure drug clonidine in the hopes that it may help the brain reach a more quiescent state until these interventions are available says sleep researcher geoffroy solelhac of the center for investigation and research in sleep in switzerland just understanding that their sleep is objectively different is reassuring to patients they feel a sort of relief knowing all that may even help them sleep better

please do send me the evidence as i would be curious to read this the video is an essay with very weak and or miss interpreted data and conclusions just because its in pubmed does not mean its true or that there is strong evidence yes indeed obesity is complex on its origin and its not only explained by one factor there is and always will be people that will struggle to loose weight for multiple reasons some unavoidable such as ae from medication metabolic disorders social factors etcnevertheless this is not a generalised aetiology a very good way to illustrate this point its by having a look at obesity rates in developing countries then there is the problem with accountability its human nature not to accept fault or take responsibility this is not an easy concept to weight just also think from personal experience i could be much healthier if i exercised more and i changed my diet and i know this the times in my life i have been healthier was because of personal choice multiple factors contribute for me to change my habits stress life situations time availability etc its not without accountabilityown health responsibility that people quit smoking for example so we should also not remove that from people or we will loose a big motivator towards a healthy lifestyle i have worked in stroke wards maternity respiratory cardiology ed and gp settings with a <number>+ year experience it will take a lot of very strong evidence to convince me otherwise as this will contradict basic physiology of the human body not only that but just by maybe seeing a small amount of patients ~<number> there is a clear physical correlation between obesity and comorbidities this is very apparent in some conditions such as gestational diabetes in pregnancy or just in general tdm sleep apnoea in respiratory miihd and as a bonus fact majority of young people ive seen dead from covid were obese as well,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4QUZmMWw3TTc1QWRqRm11RF9WMUxUYXFSdldvLUVrOUFEREhNMWdqc2QwOEQxanlFa0FtejlEbFZsWmV1WmozeTlLeW9ibWd3OC1EMThYbnpKZkNMQmc9PQ==

as someone who used to be fat i think a lot of the difference women experience at their heaviest versus thinnest has to do with men being more attracted at lower weights and thus actually treating you like a human being when i was heavy a lot of men just went on as if i didnt exist which was fine by me honestly but others were outright cruel and just completely dehumanized me when i lost weight suddenly they were smiling at me going out of their way to open the door for me interested in what i have to say that said even your friends and family treat you very differently not every single person obviously but people tend to look down on you they see you as someone who is not whole on their own someone that has problems that need fixing and thus is worth pity and in need of micromanaging its hard to have meaningful relationships with other people when they view you as fundamentally lesser not an equal imagine if all your friends and family were convinced they had a genius level iq and your was below average theyre nice enough to you but they dont treat you as one of them i know this fucked up shit is engrained in our culture because i started to feel that way after i lost weight i had to watch my best friend go through this too in our late s to understand it wasnt okay when it happened to me and its not okay when it happens to her so i stopped and started respecting her and her autonomy now i see it everywhere how people treat fat people so paternalistically its condescending how much people infantalize fat people here,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4UmpfdmZNWDBaUXVfZ0hpcWV0ZnMzak9kT1kyUDVodlp5dDdrbUVkNFFMdXRHMkVONWNQdFhQZENvcnBRTkRsRXVUdHBpanhNNlNOQXRsWjNyREFJRjB6aVRFcldjcXRRNUN3VW9xVllUMlk9

now youre doing mental gymnastics  yeah there is a correlation between being fat and having insert dozens of diseases and disorders but that doesnt mean causation except its been proven that obesity does have a causal effect on a ton of diseases secondly if there is enough correlation it might be wise to consider causation is likely yeah maybe being obese could put stress on your joints and make it hard to move but what if super obese people whose back pain is deemed to be a cause of their body weight have an underlying cause sure they might but theres one thing we know without a medical degree a fuck ton of weight on anything adds stress understanding how joints work makes it no surprise that over time carrying <number><number> extra pounds or so would deteriorate them at an accelerated rate and this is just an aside but set rate theory makes sense to me not an md to a certain point no ones set rate is morbid obesity its just not it is so expensive for the body to maintain hundreds of extra pounds of adipose tissue and evolutionarily it doesnt make sense to say someones body wants to be so overweight they cant even move by themselves or it will cause undue stress if we are talking about someone whose leptin levels keep them eating enough to maintain say a size <number> whereas another womans leptin levels keep her at a size <number> that makes sense to me <number> but no one has an advantage biologically if theyre extremely obese,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4QTJ1bDZITi0wRHpBb2xpNVE2elN5aFhOWG9XamkwR3BxaTBHRWxWcmVsU2duYjNrMUQ0QmI3X1B6dXNDckJQQ1pkSkVveFE1eTZtSklTcHpEakg3enc9PQ==

responding to all of your comments here i mostly disagree with your first point i think that sufficient correlation research should encourage further study of potential mechanisms but that caution should be taken to assuming causation fair to call that a conservative take additionally i think that causal research between obesity and various diseases is still shaky and much of my argument centered around the fact that quite a lot of this research is rooted in bmitype analyses i still firmly believe that bmi is a poor tool to investigate causal relationships between conditions because of the poor specificity with which it defines obesity and fatness yes i mostly agree with your second point id be interested to compare joint degradation stratified by muscle mass in tandem with overall weight i believe that there is a tendency for obese individuals to carry more muscle not sure about relative proportion huge grain of salthow does that impact or complicate the relationship between weight and joint pain also i believe that there are still confounding factors that could equally contribute to joint pain in fat people namely the tendency for increased weight to encourage a sedentary lifestyle what if the lifestyle were treated instead of the weight how would that affect joint pain havent checked research on this still yes extreme additional weight = more joint stress again my comments are generally applied and shouldnt be extended to extreme cases not sure what the extreme case cutoff would be maybe lbs maybe more really not sure i agree about your commentary on set weight theory i was trying to emphasize that set weights generally render dieting unhelpful and potentially harmful yes extreme obesity is unhealthy because of the immediate implications on quality of life and weight loss there may be helpful i would still encourage a whole health approach to treat other issues that may be present i worked for two years as a cardiovascular researcher studying the effect of varying degrees of cad on risk stratification especially with respect to noninvasive cad identification techniques before switching to something more social sciences focused our research group frequently discussed the effect of weight gain on obesityrelated conditions and comorbid outcomes upon review though i made too extreme claims and am sorry i still consider haes approaches to weight and health management compelling i still believe that weight is overemphasized in someones overall health but yes caution should be taken to overgeneralizing and to discounting a lot of helpful medical research advising against what im saying thanks for checking me the youtube video probably jumpstarted my passion a bit too much and after taking a deeper look the link to her sources included in the videos description is a bit limited and not of the best quality,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4V29nYTFBdGZjeW51YjQ1YThnb2JnTEpYTFJ3THB1SWlLR2JvWTJHMzFJd1FHTjY5Sl84aHNMNDB6WVE2YjNyaDRzYUNZT05OanUxRDFmTjNtUUdRb2c9PQ==

theyre growing only because their beliefs are spreading not because theyre propagating once something like a virus starts cutting into a populations base size and ability to grow via births it will also change the belief adoption rate as people realize the error of choosing poorly its like comparing the populations of people who stay in a combat zone vs those who leave it the combat will attrit the population both directly and by reducing the childbearing age population to lower birth rates if the antivax crowd want to claim theyre not in a war zone while their friends families and children start dropping all around them its a true darwinian culling situation happening fortunately with extremely deadly diseases selflimiting is quick for instance ebola once it takes hold it kills so many people so quickly that they dont even have the chance to spread it to a new area so the infection stays localized only when people travel between populations can a new population become exposed but the speedy onset of symptoms doesnt permit people to move too far in the us all forms of transit mass and personal are easily accessible and affordable an ebolalike virus could spread from city to city fairly quickly and cause all kinds of horror but once it starts communication is good enough that isolating outbreaks will be fairly simple total lockdown to stop a spread especially if it has a <number> fatality rate so the people who take precautions to limit spread will have the most freedom to move once <number> of a whole congregation dies will the remaining <number> keep attending that just seems ghoulish waiting for the next variation of the virus to infect them and cull another <number>,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4X05nSmVxZldfSW5FN3pQLW5KZVJDOUMwcERKNnk1WkVtYWhVaXY4SzA0d1RxbzJWdUlGdTZXZW5VZmM2NmFzY3N1R05tVjcwRjNDOEJ3dGo4RlVERF92R1VTXzEzamtEdkhwZmpNU2hpS0E9

for everyone whos freaking out about this let me give you some reassurance the necessary biochemistry required to make the leap both across species and to intraspecies transmission is highly complex especially between mammals and birds the evolutionary difference between the two species is far enough removed that the molecular machinery for infecting lung cells is almost completely distinct it would take a massively prolonged exposure to give avian flu sufficient time and replication cycles to transmit effectively between humans,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VU1SUzh1Nnl3S1VpNzZEMXdwSDk1QjEwekVHTWtXaXZhV3Y4SzlwT284UEJobjhiYkVwYUEwaHRxWng3enpma2dlLThCTlRMci1kT1RHMjd3Y3BvREE9PQ==

how what exactly do you think doctors have the power to do that they havent tried to do already what again here i am asking you to be precise do you propose that doctors need to do to lead and do whats right for medicine right now youre just saying that im sensitive about it and claiming that doctors have failed in doing something as a background here most physicians i know that are active in trying to push for health care reform by engaging in politics at any significant level are so burned out by the lack of any movement that they have all but given up so if you think thats the way we can help then i guess theyll just keep beating that dead horse longer or should they be more vocal that they are still beating it to appease you im not even sure what you mean by get the fuck out of the way either so feel free to clear that up as well if youd like,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5eGc0anlrbFBoczd6ZzJfTnRnMGdvTVJPMERaMFljajFnM3dSRElPdUtnR0c3T3Q1Tzljd1I0M2tXVlVMMks5anJwSkNyWWp2dWNxUVFIYjdxQzlWUGc9PQ==

i dont think its that entirely particularly because millenials and younger when they get diagnosed with cancer often have late stage cancercause you are too young to have cancer for example its been alarming gastroenterologists the number of young people presenting with stage <number><number> colon cancer they dont know what to do because screening guidelines say that preventative screenings arent required until your over <number> most physicians arent screening for cancer in millenials or younger because history has said not needed till older so you have to be essentially screaming in pain for a while to get screened know a few millenials one had stage <number> breast cancer and one with stage <number> colon cancer probably could have been caught sooner if the doctors had listened at any point during the <number>+ years of complaints but insurance also often refuses cancer screenings on younger patients unless there is ample evidence to suggest an issue so if you arent old enough to have had a mammogram you have to have persistent issues to get cleared through most insurances,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5eUtFQm03cC1Edld6eWxsMy1tYy1wQzZ5WjNHMzB4cXdvc2lmQ1lGREN4STJMSHZyNmVnbFdYWGlmQm1nSlFxdHZMNW4ySUxJeExzRTllUjMwdkN6ajVpcHdLMDNQZFNPQnl0Wi10NU1zbm89

well oddly i agree with basically everything you said i guess the rub is that when you started practicing medicine i was in elementary school or junior high ive been board certified for just <number> years so i actually harbor quite a bit of resentment for doctors who practiced in the s and allowed the guise of hmosetc to start running us in to the ground we let the government pass regulation that prohibits physicians from owning hospitals and ever since then the business people have owned them and absolutely destroyed healthcare the absurdity is that this was done to prevent doctors from having a conflict of interest meanwhile in the legal profession it is illegal for anyone other than a lawyer to own a law firm because that is seen as too much of a conflict of interest so the lawyers ethical duty to their clients is upheld as protecting clients but the ethical duty we physicians hold to our patients is dog shit now who is left to protect them the mba hospital administrators obviously to anyone in healthcare that is laughable many chinks in the armor like those eroded physician control a long time before i even had an md behind my name im an ophthalmologist as is probably obvious by the username as far as attracting talent to our field we make about as much as an internal medicine doctor unless we own our own businesses and surgery centers which i do or else i may have quit and gone back to engineering already in the s ophthalmologists were just looting medicare because the reimbursement for your typical cataract surgery was still at prephaco levels they screwed us all over and are now happily retired and complaining that my generation is lazy assholes technology changed and shifted the field and they still billed like it was an inpatient procedure now im paid <cur><number> for a surgery that takes a lot of skill to do well and for the <number> days of postoperative care afterwards in the s that paid <cur><number> not adjusted for inflation raw s <cur><number> i could make more money selling ray ban frame glasses and seeing young healthy patients in <number> minute time slots than i do operating now cataract surgery may look easy when you watch a video of someone who has done thousands but as anyone who does it will tell you its not just easy im inside of a human eye with a mm working space how much longer is that stress going to be worth it for anyone even the coveted specialties like mine are going by the wayside as the system implodes exacerbated by private equity and hospital systems buying up practices and deflating physician incomes i still am able to do some free surgery when patients need thankfully but i am in a higher volume profitable practice which is sadly rare now so i guess what i should have asked you is this im in my mid s what the hell are doctors like me gonna be able to do to change any of this because i dont see anything that i could do that would change any of this mess my generation of physicians has been handed,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5WUpFdUJTSTBNSXZWVG51RHRaRzVIQ0JJRWxrZGFwX3NxR253VDlRU2dwZkZQUFUxUU9ycGM3bUNqZVZERzc5b0J4VTgxaTU0Y1ZyM21kYm9uV05FVXc9PQ==

exactly titanium dioxide is the only food ingredient that we mix with that is dangerous aside from acids and caustic which are made inert during the mix most other ingredients are stuff like sugar and buttermilk stuff that can be swept away and wont cause much of a fuss lecithin is nearly impossible to measure and pour and it doesnt wash away easily with water carrageenan is incredibly fine and irritating and will easily puff up into clouds it coats everything and leaves behind a greasy residue that can be hard to see on surfaces and is once again hard to wash with just water they both just kind of suck though not nearly as bad as titanium which will literally be on you for days and cause your skin to crack,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TEtrd2oxSkp5Y3BSY0J5T01DbWgzdTRnTS1obldYbE9zd0pNUEdZZ01sdXZBdURJVHJKZ1ZndGdSX0NuZHlUUVFJcVZzdUFqUlpBYmRJQkIwYV9WaVE9PQ==

i dont think thats the actual reason in medical policies they generally only cover a limited set of genes often just cystic fibrosis spinal muscular atrophy and fragile x unless there is a family history or highrisk ethnicity some diseases are more common in particular populations or the patient is currently pregnant xlinked diseases are the other much stronger medical reason for testing mothers before fathers since testing the male cannot tell you the risk that a male child will inherit a copy of a deleterious variant on the x chromosome its been a while since i worked in the industry but as i recall insurers would generally default to denying most expanded carrier testing claims because the test was not medically necessary as insurers are wont to do then appealing was much less likely to be successful for males that said from a medical perspective i dont think its much of a stretch that adultery ever takes place thats also why doctors routinely recommend sti tests for people in monogamous relationships pragmatically carrier screening tests are ordered by gynecologists and obs and theres not an equivalent set of doctors who routinely see males for reproductive health so its very infrequent that males will be tested outside of ethnicityspecific charities screening of sperm donors where insurance does not apply or in response to a positive test from the mother,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MlZxUkVzREUzcmNNQlZqRTl2QVgyeWNhNUNWcjRLYXQyX3R3TnUzSTY5dEZINWIzNkh5MGpRdC1sN0J2MzdXNnFxWXBmejR0b1plOWJhYmVtXzRvRF9zY2RsV2hVOXdjdWJRVVFVdU5pbkU9

i take <number> iuday a lot is still unknown about vitamin d but its implausible that a dose lower than <number> iuday is healthy the natural dose is of the order of <number> iuday but this can be a bit less or more depending on your physiology the equilibrium amount of vitamin d in your skin due to sun exposure is about <number> iu this amount is achieved quite fast when you have full body uv exposure at this level vitamin d synthesis and destruction due to uv irradiation will be in equilibrium it takes about <number> days for the <number> iu in the skin to be transported to the liver and converted to calcidiol this then leads to the effective dose of <number> iuday and this <number> iuday is then quite a stable dose if you go outside and fully expose your skin every other day youll still get that <number> iuday because during two consecutive days <number> iu will be transported away from your skin leaving <number> iu there when you then go into the sun that <number> iu will be topped up back to <number> iu so <number> uday is a normal dose that we would get quite reliably when living in nature another way to determine the natural dose for adults is via the fact is that babies need at least <number> u i say at least because if i think the official advice for adults is wrong then it could also be wrong for babies and they would need more for optimal health babies drink about <number> liter of breastmilk a day so you should expect that there should be at least <number> iu of vitamin d per liter of breastmilk however breastmilk is almost devoid of vitamin d therefore we give babies <number> iuday of vitamin d supplements this is a very strange situation it suggests that our biology is fundamentally flawed and we need to fix it by giving babies vitamin d supplements however it has been shown that breastmilk does contain enough vitamin d for the baby if the mother gets about <number> iuday of vitamin d<url> >abstract >objectivecompare effectiveness of

>conclusionsmaternal vitamin d supplementation with <number> iuday safely supplies breast milk with adequate vitamin d to satisfy her nursing infants requirement and offers an alternate strategy to direct infant supplementation > so <number> iuday doesnt do the job but <number> iuday is enough so from a purely biological plausibility perspective we should all supplement well above the rda and make sure were getting between <number> iuday and <number> iuday the rda in contrast is based om the idea that vitamin d should act as a medicine against specific illnesses and this should be apparent in double blind tests so we single out a specific disease say heart disease and test if vitamin d supplements at some specific dose can prevent it if not then we say that vitamin d at such and such dose is ineffective against heart disease and because we havent found convincing evidence that t works for any disease other than osteoporosis and weve not ruled put adversarial effects in tests above <number> iuday we put the maximum safe dose at <number> iuday and stick with <number> iuday for prevention of osteoporosis i dont believe that this logic used to determine the rda makes any sense you basically assume a null hypothesis that vitamin d is totally useless and want that null hypothesis to be overruled by data this amounts to assuming that nature got it wrong that the natural <number> uday may be unhealthy and then sticking with much lower dosages that then cause too little vitamin d in breastmilk necessitating babies to get vitamin d supplements its far more reasonable to take the null hypothesis to be that taking between <number> iuday and <number> iuday is the optimal dose and then test if it is safe to get less than that,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bVh5aWp3d0YxZlBFbEswWFBlWXRTRS12TTdKQVFPN0I3NzhzcEFIUG9TcTBmbGZESjBLSlJvYUdod1kyREV2VDVzeVJwM0NMYkZZX3ZtU3BxeTBxQXc9PQ==

sounds like theres still ongoing research about replacing the enzyme missing in this disorder effectively but the positive thing about disorders like this that essentially lead to missing one crucial enzymatic component is that the damage they do can typically be stalled or even prevented by pharmacologically replacing the missing component so there is actually more hope than you may think and early intervention is really important here,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bEZMT1IxVC1SR1Fhb09kQnNuM1FQV2NiOWxhNEVORlBBNVBKN01lcnhEbWJVY3k1Ykd4MlJmLW44dFBadVFONERqSUhSbnF3Q09raHliSFB4aUZlbWc9PQ==

unlike influenza covid is a novel virus so while we may get knocked down by a new mutation of the flu our immune systems are fairly well adapted to it a big enough mutation on the other hand can become a pandemic kill a bunch of people and leave survivors with life changing sequelae the spanish flu epidemic in <number><number> was one such and encephalitis lethargica put many people in long term care sometimes for decades because covid is entirely new to us and we are vulnerable to being infected by it we become infected more easily pass it on more easily the symptoms are worse it does more damage during the infection kills more people and we take longer to longer to clear it from our bodies ive been infected four times the first time was while the government was telling us that there was no community spread and my symptoms were gi not respiratory and neuro once i got over it i was fine the last time it was respiratory that was over a year ago and im still having problems with energy and brain fog the good news is that we have had novel corona viruses before looks like one of the flu epidemics in the late s was actually a corona virus while those who suffered lingering symptoms were stuck with them no one was complaining about new infections after <number> years that means the virus and us reached an equilibrium the virus adapted to us by becoming less virulent and our immune system adapted to it so that we werent left with lingering symptoms and dysfunction the other good news was that our medical community began investigating claims of long covid in much less time than previous speculative illnesses and their research is opening up huge new areas of knowledge about the immune system which will eventually pay off for many many illnesses not just covid,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4ajBpUzFCU1ZpY3pTVUlfYXltdHJ4RVAxSmRYc0RQWlRBZ05MWkVGcjNuZ0Z3eWxmeF9EWVhKZDJTWmhKczlreDVFM09COUNZYnd6T2VXcXYxbTg3ZVE9PQ==

access is definitely a problem us healthcare coverage is generally messed up but especially for novel outpatient procedures like genetic tests this seems to be a problem with new lab tests generally eg apob testing is extremely rare and not covered despite general agreement among lipidologists and cardiologist that its superior to ldlc for determining atherosclerosis risk the sad part here is that with modern sequencing technology running a small panel of genes is only slightly less expensive than running a large one so those <cur><number> should have been able to test >x as many genes for the same price hopefully acog will update guidelines to include expanded carrier testing now that there is a billing code for it and many of these problems will be significantly reduced,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4cEhiT2p6V1dDb2p0UnpqNEhhMUVUQnhrbEJDNG5XcnBod0t0V0ZzMU5uNy1BN1JMOU5QOXptTG52aFRsdFVDV3FEV21oSUhzX3c4dGZNaWpZRjc4WXBhb3BOUktTdGxrd3RMSENRVk85aE09

were not experiencing compliments in the same way our gender and sexuality combination probably makes the difference when the majority of men compliment women it is super creepy andor a sexual advance when the majority of women do it to other women then the intention is to make your day better some women are hitting on other women and some mean it as a catty passiveaggressive insult but thats much less common as a gay man i do feel like a good portion of the population has a characterization of your gendersexuality combination and im not a huge fan of the compliments from women to gay men that ive heard firsthand as in many of the cases theres a tokenization or gay men to women that ive received or overheard as theres significant misogyny my age group was one of the first that society was okay with being openly gay so theres probably a lot of underlying biases that havent been addressed on both sides,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDV1VrQS0xRE9xZEtCYkY2bmRTc0RZS25MemYzR0tqWVpTZDFnYXBHSkxvUlpTdktIWDRNTWxqQVY1RGoyTmJJLU53cXlYVUhiMnQ3NGtHd1RvS3JabkE9PQ==

> ime these situations have just as much domestic violence but it is normalized no that really doesnt apply here the community religious institutions are primarily led by women who are the ones who have to carry most rites out and symbolically the husbands must humble themselves before that publicly to give you a western analogy that fits examples you might already know no one would say a pope is powerless before a king in the context of the history of the catholic church and european kingdoms the two hold different institutional powers that keep each other in check by influencing the construction and resolution of conflicting social identities when the balance favors the pope the king acts as a governor for the popes ideology the ultimate lawmaker but not the ultimate decisionmaker thats closer to the situation here > religious gender roles that keep women at home are inherently forms of control which falls on the domestic violence wheel im referring to a literal wheel chart i disagree that may be the case in western societies where land is synonymous with private property and wealth which is the highest socioeconomic value but not in other cultures where the highest value is religious order in which case control over the home is akin to control over the familys spirituality and connection to god,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDeHAxQ0hPbmN3SzZTN0p1Z3MyVWRyTkUwTGxrVHhtY2ZMVDNTSFhteDRSX2VjMzZvTE5lckNIdHIyV09KQnR1ZGZKT2tmUFhkYUR2OVkxWVZUbDk4dWtyc3JnZXNTeHdHMmo2ZjJrRV9iaWs9

lol i still dont get what your point is skinnier people have less weight to lose therefore its more difficult ie it takes longer and more effort to lose the same amount of weight ok and weight loss and a healthy lifestyle still takes a sustained effort over a long period of time regardless of what weight you start at but i can tell you that as someone who has been both a d swimmer that weighed lbs with like <number> body fat and a middle age dad who peaked at almost lbs and <number> body fat one of those life stages was a lot easier for me to find motivation to exercise and eat right and i bet even you can guess which one its a lot more important for a <number> lb person to lose <number> lbs than it is for a <number> lb person to lose <number> lbs when it comes to overall health not to mention the fact that the person who weighs lbs later into their life will likely require a significant amount of healthcare which is covered by insurancemedicare and raises premiumsdepletes medicare funds for everyone including healthy people your mentality regarding overweight people is exactly what needs to change are the vast majority of people that are overweight overweight bc they made consistently bad choices over a long period of time yes but when someone decides to make that change they dont deserve to suffer and be punished for their past choices i dont understand why people are so opposed to the idea that someone might potentially have an easier path to getting fit bc they are taking medication to assist its the same with steroids theyre probably going to raise your potential higher than it would be without them but just taking steroids wont make you jacked you still have to put the work in,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVTJvMy1kTG1kZnpjc3pIcUllcTNSR2ZJRWJvN1JHM3FBVTJndU5CZjktdUNfSTRBbjRTdXZyMlk5ZWNVdHBMemZlRG1YR0NaNzBmd0Nzd29vczFVNXc9PQ==

i have a feeling its linked to an maoi in their proprietary blend reacting to medications atleast its the only thing that makes sense to me and since they label mimosa root on the package which can often times be contaminated with b cappi bark which can cause seizures and serotonin syndrome god forbid those idiots also put managed to accidentally get st johns wart in there too there are a bunch of companies blatantly selling acodmt aminita currently including in gas stations and smoke shops all across this country and have been for over a year with aco and decades with amanita and only these diamond shruumz products seem to be causing problems crazy how these grey legal areas tend to be some of the most dangerous when it comes to drugs in general they also tend to the area that children source most of their drugs because a lot of these smoke shops selling this stuff dont id and even if they do these kids can easily get someone older to buy for them where as sourcing out actual safe mushrooms is probably way outta their reach i know i never wouldve smoked synthetic weed in highschool had it not been readily available at every gas station in town even worse is that we had access to weed and we still smoked that garbage because weed only made us feel high that stuff made us feel like we had poured drain cleaner directly onto our brains,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbWlLdmtVd1NJdDZVckRRNHN4dlVtSjhsbkRxdnFDV1pOc2l4eEdicmZTUzhGdnJreTZnc0hheE0tN25nUGtnM2VRa3g1MUhKV0dVMUpHTlBUQVJ3YWc9PQ==
youre right about acodmtamanita products being all over the place they claim they are doing the product recall because some products have way too much muscimol in them im curious about the ibotenic acid content of the products with high muscimol i wonder if they have some concentrated amanita extract which i would interpret as muscimol + ibotenic acid and some batches have received too much,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYb2o0N2duWGR0b0d3eERQR3pWZDRYbUttMWZRMjlEYmE4YXBHNTQ5RlJ2cmtiYnRKZGwwRUxfYzZNYkdBaXFEMWxNRGNBanZxdzZJMkt5VDBCampEUmc9PQ==

this has always been the solution its just economic disparity and lack of access to vaccinations thats the issue southeast asia and africa remain the highest atrisk regions for endemic cases of rabies and thats mostly due to lack of access to vaccines corruption also plays a part in this when countries do take an initiative to mass vaccinate freeroaming dog populations a lot of the allocated funds are reallocated for other uses or simply just pocketed by their respective localities its such a sad state of affairs as rabies is such a horrible way to die and can be easily prevented through vaccination,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeTJhWkhwVVk0Vzl2NjNmYmpteDlNc1AxSWlxNGQyaXl1Zk1EZTNRbUluX0ZMQ3hsdnFZTGEwWS05TU5wQXVLY0JOYUVVWGQwRWdLbDZ5TWptMFNsZnc9PQ==

addiction is uncontrollable and someone affected by it should never be held fully accountable for their addiction disease do you walk up to chemo patients and say hey ur fuckin stupid for eating all that processed food that was carcinogenic no because its a fucking disease it affects your mind body and spirit and you cannot control that so next time dont be a dick and educate yourself also marijuana does have withdrawal symptoms physical and mental but everyone withdrawals from marijuana differently please man dont come online making yourself look like an asshole tryna mansplain addiction and weed to us google is free and i think you should use it more thats a lot better than being an ignoramus and arguing with people using falsified facts to back yourself anyways blessings be upon you and hope you have an absolutely wonderful day ,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcjJ5aGM5dFgtZWg1bVpOU3VXRkZYaV94b25BM0lCbG05MkkxU1dweldhTE56VVZWYlhsR3N6NUEtTFJpaU1BeV83VGc2eE9uUmd4SGFCUm5QajI3dnc9PQ==

drug addictionabuse is not the same as having cancer bc eating red dye <number> or some shit lmfao everyone knows and actively treats drugs like opiates as harmful and that it destroys relationships i have lived it i know wat tf im talking about and comparing the bit of puking that excessive marijuana use causes compared to withdrawals from opiatesalcohol is extremely different u cant compare the two marijauna is a physiological addiction much like eating ice cream its not physcial in any sense kost that happens is people get a little sick yet they still smoke it and wonder why they are broke and bitch about the government all day with no job or money not to mention ur broke af bc u keep trying to get ur fix and will stop from eating bc u dnt have enuff money for anything but drugs so u resort to cheaper methods which dont quite scratch that itch which causes u to do dumb shit and ruin relationships no such thing as a functioning addict and <number> of the time they need to have support from friends and family but they cant be enabled they enjoy how they are and they are ok with it  i never said they were fully accountable but its def still their fault cancer is an entirely different situation than smoking u can hug a tree and claim to know more than me because u believe urself morally right but in the end u dont know wat the fuck ur talking about mansplain addiction ur the one preaching to me about the shit i was raised in it i lived it  weed isnt a big deal but treating it like an illness when all it is is simply a bad habit is funny af when compared to hard shit like fentanyl,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUUpsTG5tc3A5S0N1OTBBTjVoMlNjOWdZcXpZZDBfQzgtalZwUDZnUW45VXpUaTV4YXFFakpDVFNaZUI1c0RfSENza0ZhcExqVElkQkJVc2s3UmRnNWc9PQ==

the entire peer review and publication process needs to be revamped and brought into the modern age the constraints that made sense when we printed physical documents shouldnt still be dictating practices today papers should be well written but an arbitrary word count should never force unclear writing the primary form of a paper should be digital to allow use of the advantages of digital documents papers should be living documents easily fixable errors should not be permanent scars in important works likewise major errors should be addressed more thoroughly than a statement of retraction retracted papers dont get erased from memory the living document itself should be changed to correct or to highlight the problems in ways that cant be missed peer review should be an ongoing process that has prepublication and postpublication stages think of all the postpublication peer review that occurs in journal clubs and online forums that should be harnessed to make the living documents better journals should still play a major role in this process someone still needs to effectively own the living documents to be responsible for maintaining the servers that house them to make those uncomfortable changes when major problems are discovered and to make sure the documents stay living and dont get abandoned,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV0pZUDNmRjljUUU3XzduZkloVWZmY3d3SVV4OWV1UFd5cUVabWNlX3c1aS13UDNoRmFKRFdzV29JUkc3aWdnT1BFMjgtdlNjN205VDRhQTNDQjhsMGc9PQ==

even old drugs and out of patent drugs needs fda approval for sale and marketing plus this is marketed under different brand names in other countries its likely due to abuse and addiction reasons when other relatively safer options are available and its a tricyclic antidepressant which is one of the worst classes for safety and efficacy as a pharmacist i do believe the fda can be financially motivated this however does not seem to be one of them,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSDdzMUR6TGt3M1g0eWRQRnd5cUplaXR0M3hrb2RSQ2otOEFzdGRUQTJKbUVzVUZ1TXB6YkRtWGVUVmhubVMzd0F4UE5vZHZadFR3ekV3MlZOWXVra3c9PQ==

incidentally some drugs are patented as a worse version it is replacing so drug companies can make more money best example imo is ketamine where both enantiomer are patented as separate drugs and marketed for the same condition taking twice the dose of a single one can be better than taking one dose of each but certainly then one would be worse that generic unpatented ketamine because if not neither patent should exist theres no advantage to separating the two,r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnam5BeVhCNDUyRXVGQ3FGNlpvUVdjWkxrTmlHa3VPUHZBZXliVjlyNUY5MmJpZmNHVTlUNFRCd3JYa3VaQ1h0UzJzeExEYVEteUdkd2NYLS1TLTlSUGc9PQ==
