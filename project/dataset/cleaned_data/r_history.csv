it looks like it is theorized that lnba could have resulted in zoonotic infections while lnba+ was necessary for the transmission of bubonic plague but the two studies mentioned are not in agreement about this one group thinks the neolithic decline was through zoonosis the other thinks it was from plague what i find interesting is this isnt plague zoonotic black plague was transmitted to humans from infected fleas on the backs of vermin so isnt this zoonotic not a biologist or an epidemiologist so this is just my best guess perhaps someone else can provide greater clarity,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCLUk5QXdYYzdYQXBRRU00TW5xODRzOVpITVVTRk5yR3Qyc3NqbUhWWG5aSE5Lcmd6V29hcVFDWC1oOUJ5RXhQTlZrU1NMY1NyYjlxNzFndUY4bHdGUktkM3FCLW0yOFJBVEhtdVF5dVdqbjQ9

frankly i think that this is a route that many amateur historians and people who end up being historians eventually go down but most realise what youre starting to ie that it is not that useful theres really only so much you can fit on a timeline and once you know these things these timelines arent much of a use to you as a professional historian i rarely have to think about or mention specific dates its more of just an understanding that said if you are interested in doing this the best way in my mind would be to split it up thematically have multiple layers of the same period of time so <number><number> ce politics <number><number> ce economics <number><number> ce science <number><number> ce social politics <number><number> ce inventions etc etc if you have multiple timelines of the same period you can space them out a bit more and still read them together ive quickly stolen this picture but imagine instead of project a b c etc its each of those topics in the same time period but with different areas of focus <url>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDc3Joak50Y1VBQzVxVXpIcWJwal90QThPa2JqelNvRFVhdlFzaHRXWlBlREdWWHgtelY5ZGZCOGEzZjNXVDBOTWxzV3AyMll2U2tGdl9zVEU4ZnVYTEE9PQ==

its really not its called iconography roman iconography is pretty well studied and i promise you that the person running the study knows it better than you do you not only have to think about what it looks like but why it would be there you also have to think about what it is presenting there are multiple clues that all point towards minerva if i drew a little circle with an arm extended above it and two dots for eyes and a small mustache you would know who it was and wouldnt go it could be anyone with a small mustache hailing a cab we get a lot of signs through iconography as to who is being represented for example if we see someone wearing a lion skin its typically herculesherakles or alexander the great or one of his diadochoi imitating him theres a rare chance that it could be milo of croton but even if you found it in croton i would still take the safe bet of hercules unless his name was literally carved in it there are clues that can help us separate hercules from alexander facial here is a quick one to look for but is not always definitive as hercules can sometimes be shown as clean shaven too the weapon he has is usually a huge indicator hercules usually has a club and alexander usually has armour or is otherwise dressed while hercules is usually nude or scantily clad with minerva theres a chance to confuse her with athena so we have to take in things like where it came from when it was made etc to help distinguish,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRKT3RoRjJMemlzQlN6M1lsOGxpSXBNbWc3bzV5SEpmMTRfTUdFSVlUUmJ3M3JMQ2syZUU4Sjk2NnJ6b0VYUVVYdDFzblRtd0oyUU1rRnNWT3BrVVdUUkE9PQ==

youre welcome yeah the person who carved the image didnt do a wonderful job they even struggled with making a straight line for the spear im going to guess that its not the same person who made the ring but you never know the comparison link doesnt work google capitoline museum minerva note shes missing her spear but you can see where it would have gone though doing so i now see the museum is saying its a bit older now but basically most statues of minerva will show similar traits even more modern ones which reflect the roman iconography compare her with athena as well and you can see some of the influence,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRKaGl1SUlxYmxQcEwwTF94OVppVC05My05WkJTTmxVTjV2c3BWWTF5ekE5RGIyWkQwV0QxVjVsZHBHMENOU1FHVFNNcjVXdHowMlo3RWlVVTlpcmNwd3c9PQ==

thank you you are right there is limited use to timelines its not a history grimoire after all and i also believe memorizing exact dates to be largely useless i for the most part make this as a hobby since it is fun and there is no intention to memorize dates or anything it does help better understand the times to me and also seems to work great as a condensed short note to take a glance and remember a said period with that said your suggestion is valid i should probably do that either have to find a more flexible app to be able to make multiple lines in a single page for it or just dive in and make multiple different folders each for different aspect honestly making it as been a good excuse to scrutinize info i would have kept away from normally like usually it would have been yeah ottomans and safavids fought a bunch all the time but now i can actually to some degree name each of them casus belli of and the end result of each as a hobby it is a fun endeavor if it turns anything good in the end i will probably make the same things for other countries andor regions,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRKMmhmdnFOb09CRTNwYWdwVGV6Y2U4OWEwSWNGVVRjTlh2VE91VFAxbS1wVnNoM0RjbndIbzlzOGtfM2VDQ3ctOXRNdzRnV0RMdkxJakNNb0FWX3pvWmZ5ZWNkS0RPbWRHQ0tRUkI1SVlCVW89

yes and no its the equivalent and they have a lot of the same mythology origin skills etc but they are coming through two different cultural lenses and also we have a lot of things happen with mythology where godsgoddessesdemigods can blend together and join characteristics in one cultures system but a similar one in another might keep them separate also you would add different variations of the same deity within that culture or as time goes on they change so minerva in one century might be different from minerva in another or minerva in one place might be different from minerva in another so those both will be different from athena in athens even if sometimes only subtlety so for simplicities sake we can say its athena in rome and if youre not dealing with mythology as part of your studies thats perfectly fine to keep it at that but it is a bit more complicated than that if you really are digging deep also we see a bit of cross cultural exchange where they can sometimes get attributes from different cultures that are added to theirs they didnt copy and paste minerva from the greeks minerva was etruscan as well but some of the mythology associated with athena did become associated with minerva through this joined association,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLX1hwMi1yVkp3YTRTNUV3TGdXSm1aYWxtYVl3dHlFOEZNOWhxd3dXcmo0aVJFNWhkSV92bGZRaEZwLV82SW5wbmVzdE8zMmozTVJJYXYzYmJMZDBSblE9PQ==

american this was taught in my history courses as a tactical tie with the failed canadian campaign offset by victories elsewhere such as new orleans new york and horseshoe bend it was strategically positive due to the decisive defeat of british native american allies most notably tecumsehs confederacy as well as spanish control over florida weakening of course the entire war is heavily intertwined with the coalition wars the strategic disposition of britain is what allowed the fledgling us to fight on somewhat equal terms in the first place what i find more weird is all the people in this thread portraying it as a clear british victory,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLMTl3T1B1a25SYkpyekZYX3h3dF9waFhBdFRRTmItc2FhZU43c0VhYnV4dk96Ry1FelhKdlU4cHdJcHY3WEQ4WHJpWHFGdEhRaGZFSTJVWk91TkVqSTNHMFRaSGZZMXVQSDByTGotbzBJUnc9

mars can often be lacking a shield but this isnt always the case but a shield is usually more associated with minerva while the spear and helmet is associated with both he sometimes holds a trophy dedicated after a battle to claim victory though both sides could do so or a cup the next thing to look for is a beard though mars can sometimes be shown as younger especially in older works <url> the use or grip of the spear is one of the distinguishing features though mars usually has it pointed outward as if ready to use it or he has a high grip with the blade pointed down into the ground <url> i dont think i know of any ancient depictions before the rd century ce that show minerva ready to use her spear she would use a thunderbolt as a weapon instead though i have seen coins describe the bolt as a spear which i believe is wrong the grip can sometimes be high like with mars but can also be lower as shown on this ring a bit more relaxed so look for the shield or lack thereof look for the beard or lack thereof look for how the spear is used and held and in more detailed images we would look at clothing and other associated imagery the thunderbolt etc then you look at popularity and the representation minerva as part of the capitoline triad was far more important than mars outside of gaul and was worshipped more widely and in more representations,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRMUU5aRjdMMnRNNDMwbUZ0dUxxRVYtNGJRLU9tVVJ6dFdUQk9jRkFnN19LZFB3TXdfZTJVRVRqcDJ3T2dsUTBhaDlHdEZJMFVKZVFxVHdSYmZjdHJ3SlE9PQ==

i think its safe to assume it happened though there are mythological elements clearly embellished but thats something you tend to do when youre trying to start a new country you lend it legitimacy by spinning yarns of heroism destiny divine right etc the colony is pretty much confirmed to have existed as the emperor of the byzantines adopted the english migrants for use in the army and permitted them to take land that was previously held by heathens i dont think anything substantial came of the colony though like its not as if they formed a kingdom there was clearly not enough staying power or upset in local power dynamics so the english never established themselves as a ruling class and instead blended in with the locals,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGROVXlXYkdRRG1BYzVLTGFia1Fkc3JOWjFCeXNvMVJBbEVtQkxHTkxBeHdWNGVoTDJWRTFBTmFZdDZOaDJuOEpoa1VBNnVNRzNMLV9wckJrbzJKZllza1E9PQ==

i guess you can say that yes english unification was built on the desire for angle and saxon hegemony that was in demand because of incursions from vikings making it increasingly difficult for smaller petty kingdoms to exist a strong unified kingdom was basically the solution to viking raids long term so i guess yes in a way the island and the defence of it was the reason for the anglosaxon union and for why it was called east anglia there were various places the angles settled that didnt necessarily translate into angle kingdoms most angles that migrated north west and south were minorities in kingdoms that were saxon first and foremost over time angles would achieve parity more or less so it was called the kingdom of east anglia because from their point of view angles lived to the north west and south they just didnt have their own kingdoms,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGROQi1iRER5ZWtMZi1vWV82RUthNXBGbUZHdm5pUDk5YjUzcGRvLWlPTlprQUJJbElTalkwZWhjNENWd2p6TWpkTk1JNjBkM2I1QkZoc1VaMTNzYmc3dUE9PQ==

how did america resolve labor demands after slaves were emancipated i dont really remember being taught this in k<number> and even in my college history courses at least not in detail i understand there was an adjustment period where slaves were slowly receiving their freedom after the civil war but how did the government manage to make up for that free labor economically was there a meeting where officials came up with a type of programming to solve that problem how did america transition from relying on free labor to developing a social hierarchy dependent upon profession and income i know there were elements of that hierarchy during the slave era but was the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class as significant as it is now these questions lead me to believe that people in power when faced with this issue somehow managed to develop the concept of the american dreama competitive and seemingly unattainable ideal this was integrated into the culture to draw people in with the promise of free land and upward mobility as we know from history achieving this dream is not as easy as it sounds numerous factors and influences create marginalized groups the reality of this facade is that this core aspect ingrained into americans since birth is genuinely fictionalized we need to change the culture to achieve true equality what has historically defined the top in america money fame fortune scholarly achievement positions of power why was that decided for us would it be possible to redefine what it means to be an american by reshaping what being at the top means and spreading that new definition widely anywho those are just my thoughts and opinions i am genuinely interested in knowing specific and accurate details about this era as questioned in the first paragraph thank you in advance,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYWDVpeW1HQ0hpMUNITTJiSWVvamtzNkY0cUxJNEltclNVVE85WllNbUIwNVlfVURTWWtNTHlmZGs1YV9wMUZHTkMwTW5hMndOVzd6cWNGZmszMjdmODhNUDZYdjBES1JnOTgwUWhFVG8xb3c9

im guessing its either a wordplay that we dont get because we dont understand the language completely or the original language contains idioms that do not convey the meaning when directly translating the words hypothetically something like to open this one meaning to piss on a tree in this case somebodys leg or the original audience would understand what was normally on the floor of a bar that a dog would get a good view of spilled drink peoples genitals something else the sumerians put on the floor etc,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYMjdyMXNiRjBOd0gwdTdNdS1tazVEcGZzZzd3MkNycFZHUkxxV1N4Z1NPRklvWTY4M0FNaXdUY1IxeC03TmIyblJVVGR5bXA0Mzc1Y2RseGRYRE1lQ3N5N3ZrNC1zOE4tQ3dJY0Nra0RTMFk9

correct trying to convey the tone meaning and impact of the original text is a goal of many translators of ancient texts some of us do just ignore the nice bits and go for as literal as possible but theres a reason our translations of poetry and artsy stuff arent as popular it loses its flair when you get too technical but technical can be very helpful for other reasons,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYa2M1all5S0tnZUR2b0w5aTMwTjk1SEc4Q1pkUUZfc3FkY01PdXE4N2xrOTlXNWR3d1VXejJUR1lSdExHZ3dpQ1l2VkV6Ml9hanFnTVFjOF9RLWdDbVE9PQ==

it kind of depends the problem for historians as the other poster mentioned is what survives some stuff will be widely used my local historical society had a project for people to journal their experiences through the pandemic that will be a useful source the journals will probably be scanned at some point and maybe even transcribed but the archive will also hold the paper journals the other thing that matters is whats the project the historian is studying are journals helpful to it for big things that are national in scope and widely known they might be helpful but if theyre smaller niche topics like about something like a firefighting crew working the wildfires in nw new mexico this summer my journal as someone several states and environments away wont be useful if its for something like the history of environmental science of some topic than scientific papers and news articles might be more important but its going to depend on what the historians are studying and what they have available to them the issue of digital data loss is a scary topic for archivists right now and if you google terms like digital dark age theres some really interesting writing on the topic,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZdll4dGd5R1h6YnNkNjJUd3gySFVONEwtUWZWYW91c0dGSXExdk14SF96U1VHNmhrZnBDdXpseGMyNU9oZk5kSjM0enEwX09EQzRTMEZLVklhX1U3bGc9PQ==

how did america resolve labor demands after slaves were emancipated youve got like <number> topics in this post and all of them are complicated labor demands varied wildly from place to place and most of it was solved through immigration whether that was immigration internally from state to state as it was post s or whether that was from foreign immigration and whether that immigration was voluntary or forced through enslavement changes over time and over location i dont really remember being taught this in k<number> and even in my college history courses at least not in detail i understand there was an adjustment period where slaves were slowly receiving their freedom after the civil war but how did the government manage to make up for that free labor economically there generally wasnt a governmental policy on labor demand the advent of the administrative state and policies around topics of labor supply wages economic management etc are fairly new there was the period between <number> and <number> and then again between <number> and <number> were there was some federal attempt at regulation of the economy through the st and nd national bank but it was minimal and mostly just addressed monetary policy very primitively and government debt most of what we think of now as economic policy is an invention of the fdr administration and wasnt possible legally until after the famous west coast hotel case this topic involves a combination of complicated state capacity building and the history of the administrative state and a complicated legal history youll often hear of the lochner era of the court and its this pre west coast hotel era when courts had a very strict interpretation of the commerce clause of the constitution most labor regulation was left to the states in the southern states former slave holders enacted a series of laws called black codes that limited freedom of black americans ideas about citizenship were still very much in question states determined citizenship then and most southern states didnt allow for black citizenship that changed in <number> with the passage of the th amendment but it was still a fight usually things like labor contracts and debt forms of social control enslaved people were often forced to take the last names of their enslavers so everyone would know where they were supposed to be working and things like vagrancy laws and prison leasing kept black people stuck in place and limited their ability to find new jobs manisha sinhas new book the rise and fall of the nd republic gets into this a little but there are other complex issues like republican ideas about economic progress in the south that created incentives for large farming concerns and low wage farm laborshare cropping systems that made small hold farming economically unviable was there a meeting where officials came up with a type of programming to solve that problem how did america transition from relying on free labor to developing a social hierarchy dependent upon profession and income i know there were elements of that hierarchy during the slave era but was the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class as significant as it is now there werent officials meeting to come up with solutions to economic problems until fdrs administration because <number> there wasnt an administrative state that could do it and <number> the federal government wasnt legal to really have a national economic policy in the way we think of it today bc of the courts interpretation of the commerce clause i dont know what you mean by free labor exactly but america was probably more hierarchal pre wwii than it is now the passage of flsa and the nlra were key to workers being able to really advocate for improved conditions before that a workers only real option was to leave and labor stability was a huge issue as to information on the wage gap its also very complicated <number> we dont have statistics on national wages that are great before the passage of the th amendment there is some information from the irs before that but they mostly focused on the extremely wealthy and that was only for a short period around the civil war bc of proportional taxation rules in art i of the const there is some census information and some states did a good job but nationally its a hodge podge before <number> <number> wealth was very different pre<number> most peoples wealth was entirely in land especially after the th amendment and the nd largest property class enslaved people suddenly didnt exist bc of that wealth inequality seems less bc enough people owned enough land that they seemed to have similar wealth but income inequality was wildly different most farm laborers made about <cur><number> a month throughout the th century that was a large driver of people quitting farming and getting into wage labor in the growing industrial sector of the economy wealth inequality could be huge with a simple mechanic in the city earning <number> or <number> times what a farm laborer was earning but their wealth might seem similar bc the farm laborer had land and the mechanic did not but at the end of the th century with a real uptick during wwi you get some of the hierarchy you seem to be talking about but it was just a different hierarchy and was probably even less hierarchal as wage labor became more important than land holdings these questions lead me to believe that people in power when faced with this issue somehow managed to develop the concept of the american dreama competitive and seemingly unattainable ideal this was integrated into the culture to draw people in with the promise of free land and upward mobility as we know from history achieving this dream is not as easy as it sounds numerous factors and influences create marginalized groups the reality of this facade is that this core aspect ingrained into americans since birth is genuinely fictionalized the concept of the american dream is complicated its changed significantly over time from a jeffersonian idea of the republican yeoman farmer at the end of the th century into an idea of a pioneering westward moving go getter into an entrepreneur and self made man during the later th and early th century after the frontier closed to something more like it is today that began after the end of wwi before wwi the american dream wasnt extended to everyone it wasnt meant to include non anglo americans initially by the end of the th century german immigrants were included in the idea but not very many other immigrants were by the time of the s it was expanding to irish immigrants by the turn of the century southern europeans and jews were starting to be included and the idea of america as a melting pot was beginning to take shape black people were beginning to be included during wwii as part of the double v campaign mexican americans were able to begin to stake a claim during lbjs administration with his great society program sarah churchwell had a recent book on the subject in the th century called behold america shes got an essay in the catalyst that gives a brief overview of

we need to change the culture to achieve true equality what has historically defined the top in america money fame fortune scholarly achievement positions of power why was that decided for us would it be possible to redefine what it means to be an american by reshaping what being at the top means and spreading that new definition widely the top has been defined differently in different times and places part of the fight between hamilton and jefferson was this definition part of why no one liked adams was bc of his more aristocratic definition money and power come from different sources at different times for jefferson and washington it was in vast estates and the people they enslaved for hamilton it was a robust commercial sector for adams it was a kind of mix of piety civil duty and economic comfort this is very different than what the top was after the us civil war or during the s when the jeffersonian ideal became completely eclipsed and the south became the least economically productive area of the country these hierarchies are always changing scholarly achievement was only sort of possible in the th century when the us started to develop a respectable university system before that if you wanted to be respected doctor or scientist you went to europe preferably germany lousi menands metaphysical club does a good job of looking that change right now in the us there is a fight between what different groups count as the top there is polarization about the value of expertise what is a respectable way to earn money what is an acceptable level of wealth who should control the political direction of the parties etc id also say that i disagree with the other poster is on wage growth wages were higher at the end of the century if you were a skilled urban worker they were probably up about <number> to <number> depending on where you lived if you were a farm laborer they were probably only up about <number> but this wasnt consistent bc the was no national bank to regulate debt and currency the us went through a financial panic about ever ten years wages yoyoed the entire century and you could very well be earning a lot less in any given year than you were a year or two ago on top of that there was a lot of inflation theres a real argument as to how much real wages increased a lot of time even though your wages may have been higher than they were a decade previously your real wages could be lower this was especially true for farm laborers and part of the reason why small scale farming wasnt really viable in the south this is kind of lengthy but you can scroll through to the charts and see the variation in income by job by region and by time period <url>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZdEVsYXk3N2hSUGVtRl9UeWJVVDNUZ2kxMnJWMDJ5SnppTFJYZnY2ekg5VE5HRHpVSTZFdGlVQWNoUV9EOVVZWE1uQ0VqazM5R0RMT1MtRDhFRElRc2c9PQ==

thanks for sharing this article i had read about the surafend massacre when its th year anniversary had rolled around in dec <number> from the perspective of an australian who experiences the stories of the heroic anzac spirit at galipolli on an annual basis this account is hardly if ever mentioned and the national war memorial does not account for it publicly the archives that the memorial houses do mention surafend of course so it is important to remind ourselves continuously of the dark side to humanity to lose the accounts of these events is an embarrassment to the memory of those who suffered,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmbHRVQTFHc0FhaDFkOUNGNFprSXRNYVVfYVRCVlZPUDZ4OTVMdzJXWmdKNVlIanEyVnc2NDYyb1owSlJGUXhuTkphU25scDRjYkwyTUFDNzJKOW1sUHc9PQ==

i am going to take a crack at the dog joke i believe even ancient bars had a countertop or table and kept the alcohol high up so naturally if a dog walked into a bar he would not be able to see even above the counter and the high up bottles therefore he would only see on the ground even in the old west they would keep spit or filth jars on the floor for people to use in the bar i believe this could have been a tradition far far back in time as well i believe the joke is a dog walking into a bar not being able to see anything high up and then getting into the filth or spit jars on the floor thinking its a drink just my interpretation i cant imagine it being random humor as that would mean developing a joke meta to break in the first place if that all happened without being recorded and they decided to record their first meta joke that would be truly funny,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRnQ3RMdV9uMEdlcUNUOWVnUlgtOEs2dFNhY0NrVm9SSnliR3VwamYtSDIyWTlzQXYxLVIyRE5haDJ6clJaTjJRb2JKZ3VFc0tONnIwWGxyMVJOdFV0amc9PQ==

did the escape from alcatraz use a raft that included a wooden pallets according to the nonfiction book titled escape from alcatraz written by j campbell bruce on pages <number> and <number> it says morris said i want to find out more about the beach and angel island and the channel between there and marin also a point or two about our route down to the beach i hear there is a pile of lumber still on pallets near the powerhouse maybe we can use a few boards to stiffen our rafts he debated a moment this is friday we go a week from monday night i think that since the escape route was at the shore right next to the powerhouse that its logical that they would have planned to build the raft using a empty lumber pallet that was kept outside the power house the fbi report said that they had access to <number> raincoats to craft the life jackets and raft with and thats surely enough sleeves to sew together for inflatable inserts into a long rectangular type pallet a pallet raft would have the advantage of keeping them out of the water level and since the water was not too choppy it would have been practical because it would keep them close to the water level where they wouldnt pose such a large silhouette on the waters and a pallet raft would have been large enough to hold <number><number> persons and clarence and john anglin were from florida were they would have known all about pallets and rafts and docks made from pallet type wood a pallet raft would be a nobrainier for them to craft in a jiffy and a pallet raft would easily float back out to sea on the current after they made it to the shore leaving no trace behind of their escape route and any airborne searchers would not take notice of a wooden pallet floating in the ocean because that region is a prime traffic zone for shipping vessels that presumably could easily have lost a pallet of cargo to the waves in a storm and the power house is easily within view of the workshops where they were gathering the materials for the escape they would just have to watch and wait for the right day when a empty pallet was left outside the powerhouse to put the plan into action,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRnckFjMTAwemE0ak9UMXE1b2ttb0xva1dtdGR4ZmlyZk1wVnRmSVFjdlgzYmJza2Uya1l2T21EMWlsLXNJazlyLWJ0cXNGdFUtQnZwd0xRdjRQWEpkMmc9PQ==

did the escape from alcatraz use a raft that included a wooden pallets according to the nonfiction book titled escape from alcatraz written by j campbell bruce on pages <number> and <number> it says morris said i want to find out more about the beach and angel island and the channel between there and marin also a point or two about our route down to the beach i hear there is a pile of lumber still on pallets near the powerhouse maybe we can use a few boards to stiffen our rafts he debated a moment this is friday we go a week from monday night i think that since the escape route was at the shore right next to the powerhouse that its logical that they would have planned to build the raft using a empty lumber pallet that was kept outside the power house the fbi report said that they had access to <number> raincoats to craft the life jackets and raft with and thats surely enough sleeves to sew together for inflatable inserts into a long rectangular type pallet a pallet raft would have the advantage of keeping them out of the water level and since the water was not too choppy it would have been practical because it would keep them close to the water level where they wouldnt pose such a large silhouette on the waters and a pallet raft would have been large enough to hold <number><number> persons and clarence and john anglin were from florida were they would have known all about pallets and rafts and docks made from pallet type wood a pallet raft would be a nobrainier for them to craft in a jiffy and a pallet raft would easily float back out to sea on the current after they made it to the shore leaving no trace behind of their escape route and any airborne searchers would not take notice of a wooden pallet floating in the ocean because that region is a prime traffic zone for shipping vessels that presumably could easily have lost a pallet of cargo to the waves in a storm and the power house is easily within view of the workshops where they were gathering the materials for the escape they would just have to watch and wait for the right day when a empty pallet was left outside the powerhouse to put the plan into action,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqeFItNzl1SFFJeS1DNS01QWJ1S1VObC1YaWwzVldGanF2WTdJWlY3WVNWazdOVFNWZTc1TDRlMVpGU3RnQjRXMXZWdHJjWU5ZenJTQURWZkJvVGJ5T2c9PQ==

it was age of cultural economical and scientific degress also you cannot forget that middle ages lasted from th to th century youre talking about universities but they didnt appear until late th century and most of them are much younger than that the fascinating thing about middle ages is that we dont really know anything about its first half which is sometimes called the dark ages so we tend to forget it even happened and when we imagine middle ages we imagine the late gothic era from the end of it with knights in plate armor and majestic castles but thats huge oversimplification of the entire era its the same with the ancient rome it has cca <number><number> years of history depending whether you count eastern roman empire or not but when people talk about it they only imagine the era of caesar and augustus,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqd2lBSFZ0MFpDUHZmc0FaNjNta25oOEFlZnZaanlfSGhwcXk3LVJwUll4UUp1VTdfd2hEdDk3WkN3OFdhWG1vVFNIUnA0QVhUMjJZLThWcmZoYXhFMXc9PQ==
the very term medium aevum is from the th century and it fits right in with the idea of the renaissance which is quite literally supposed to be a rebirth of the arts and science of antiquity it was the renaissance scholars who first saw and bamed the midfle ages as a dark interlude between tge glories of ancient rome and greece and the renaissance return to those glories in a way those universities were the breeding ground of the very idea of the middle ages and their inferiority to both what was before and what came after,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqRkJscXBhZjZuWGRFTXU2bmdtbzZrdy1IaVdIR2hYd3NhbFJfcEJFT1pZQ1BYLVZQVUxkWE9KX0EwT1g3Rkl4MkN0M2FNQUJkaU9CTlN5bFFzRFdRd2c9PQ==

im not an expert in this area by any means but it would seem to me the swap only extends to certain social issues that are important today someone can correct me if im wrong on that id have to imagine the nature of political and cultural concerns were so radically different at the time its misleading to make one to one comparisons i also feel were experiencing a shift over the last decade the republicans of today are quite different than the republicans of <number><number> years ago democrats less so but i believe weve seen some shift there as well just as an offhand example it would seem that republicans have a much more positive view of russia whereas democrats have a less favorable view there are more pertinent examples that come to mind but would be harder to unpack in a short reddit comment any case i can see based on the last decade how radically different the parties might look <number><number> years from now,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxTGYyaHdqenVCUkI4MWJGV3c1MWNCRU42TXJpQ25CWWRtVlVab1NSUW9wUVZhbl81cE1KcU9VdzJ1QmE1TVV4aGdOS3ZTaV9PV3JRS2loQzJGSExYelRNNkUzN1hfUDdGck5wNFNpUG9QZXc9
depends in some regions of the europe we can say formerly roman there are relatively sufficient historical records in some nothing at most scarce reports of traders eg in central europe there was a slavic state called samos empire in the th century it covered current czechia sorbia and part of austria possibly even parts of slovakia and slovenia and realistically the only thing we know about it is that samo was a trader from francia and had <number> kids supposedly nothing else theres almost <number> years of void before the existence of another state in the area the great moravia was recorded and for example the baltic region is mostly unrecorded until thth century imho dark ages is very fitting name for the for the first half of middle ages,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxLU9VeTdqS2JCSHZxQXVjVjFZZHlrV0hvcWFLZWc1M2hOZ3J4Y0RSVXo5U3ZiU0RGZEtBRi1EdWZMM2tnZWtTTUtSdnBUMnNnUjhCempSeTNIQzNPRnc9PQ==

i get where youre trying to go with the latter point but its still far too early to draw historical conclusions there is the collapse of the neocons as the leading movement within the republican party yes but the party switch is a bit older and broader moreso it should be understand that the parties were not ideologically driven they were regionally driven thus they encompassed political movements found in given regions the entry and exit of specific groups from the big tent of the democrats is a fascinating process of its own but the progressives in the republican party were driven out in the <number>s the same time a great many conservatives were pushed out of the democratic party by lbj and thus the party machine itselfs embrace of civil rights,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxOEo1X0phZnlNUEFDZzRUQTdad2k5XzVjb3otQ29hbTV4XzFMcGVrTFhPNjBkcTFvV204V3VVeU8tUzk4aGlJTWJzVGtfR3o3S0tBc2ttaTRvem5OMFE9PQ==
hence one needs to define welfare state because it emerged out of the given context of th century european capitalism if we mean it in a narrow definition then it cant exist until then but in the broader definition of a centralized state is taking care of the needs of its people we are looking at different social contexts the need for the state to provide emerged because other things that used to provide those things had withered away so in other words yes thats the answer but i felt there was more to the question than that,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxalRIS2NON0VOb0VTRnRyeFZpY2J3czNNS1FLNFJIdk82cjRydzFBa3JEdkx4UnZyWHBjbzB4dW92Y09pY3J0eEZOVjdfMmZELUxFaDM3SHZTMHc4ZHc9PQ==

i think of it like the polynesians its incredible that they spread so far with the technology they had but we forget that those humans were just as clever as we are now ancient babylonians were doing advanced mathematics its not farfetched that humans traveled across the landbridge using boats for part of the way but that those populations died out at some point i think thats the answer these human populations were not extremely wellestablished and rose and fell with their circumstances climatological social etc,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxUXhWVE9oNFlyd0U5LWlSeEprTTVMUktqZXBuOXpJeG5Na1RQYTdyZEtNNVdsN3VyX1o2RnBVeG9UbEtyVG5NT0wwZ1BndGlBT1o2N3I3bDNGWk40M0E9PQ==

this is just in terms of the gop and dems and not stuff like the antifederalistsfederalists whigsdemrepublicans or any of the no nothings free soilers stuff and this is just on the topic of racial issues but a lot of other things like labor rights and social welfare issues tie into the shift of urban constituencies basically the dem party had a few major constituencies a big one was southern political power holders but the other really important one is the urban political party bosses that could turn out large numbers of voters tammany hall is kind of the prebollweevil example that most people are familiar with these urban bosses maintained their political power by turning out large numbers of working class and urban poor to vote they did this by giving out aid and creating jobs and patronage a lot of this was very corrupt but it still generated a lot of economic benefits that the party could control in the s the us started getting bollweevil infestations that were destroying cotton crops it made share cropping that was already untenable economicallly for the share croppers impossible so you start getting a migration from the south to the north of black americans they are shut out of farming bc they cant afford land so they get jobs in urban settings in factories a lot of northern businesses actively recruited them as a counterbalance to growing labor power henry ford did a lot of this but as these people move north they get incorporated into the democrats urban political machines its not a smooth process you have people like wilson who fight against it within the party but by the time you get to fdr in places like new york detroit chicago and cincinnatti black americans are an important part of the dem urban coalition and you see fdr having to thread this line between his southern coalition partners and demands from his northern urban coalition partners fdr starts making reforms that can do both things all war housing thats built is segregated but bc of the work of a philip randolph and his threat of a march on washington fdr issued exec order <number> which prohibited discrimination in hiring for defense industry jobs <url> black americans also launched the double v campaign that very much tied the us civil rights movement to the victory in wwii and drew clear comparison to the lack of democracy in the us this put a lot of pressure on fdr bc of the obvious hypocrisy of the us position of making the world safe for democracy when there were frequent racist riots and attacks by white people against black servicemen and black workers in the war industry fdr institutes programs like the black panthers the red tails and the nd inf div by the time of truman you get a reversal of wilson and a desegregation of the military and federal government you still have the feds letting states administer federal programs like the gi bill and the fha that states run in a racist manner banks made sure the fha was administer in a racist manner everywhere in the us up through <number> but all these things were creating a conflict in the dems in <number> you get the split with the dixiecrats many like strom thurmond who would become republicans around the time of goldwaters <number> campaign throughout this entire time basically since the late s when enough black americans were excluded from democracy in the southern states there was a push within the gop to become more openly a party that catered to white interests this faction of the gop was coined the lily white gop you see strong movements in all the southern states to fight what were called the black and tan republicans who wanted a biracial coalition this basically comes to a head in the s with the crm and the civil rights act herbert humpries gave a speech in support of lbj at the <number> dem convention that forced the dems to choose a side they chose civil rights at the same time the gop nominated barry goldwater goldwater pretty openly courted racists with his states rights campaign until too many klansman started showing up at his events at first he tried to play coy it was very much akin to donald trumps initial refusal to reject david dukes endorsement when trump claimed he didnt know who he was goldwater kind of pretended he didnt know about it goldwater campaigned on his opposition to the cra and to brown v board goldwater also violated laws and gop rules by having primaries held in segregated locations to prevent black gop members from participating the san francisco gop convention is famous for its open racist hostility to their black members this was the turning point for prominent black gop members like jackie robinson black delegates talked about being spit on and having their feet stomped on people like rockefeller and george romney who spoke about rejecting the klan and john birch society members were heckled in light of what was going on throughout the south at this time white racial attacks were playing out on tv almost every night bc bull connor had just left office the year before goldwater lost opposition to school integration was still strong places like prince edwards county in va had shut down its entire school system instead of integrate and kept it shut down for <number> years not reopening until <number> the dems leaned into civil rights after that with lbj passing <number> major civil rights bills the <number> cra that outlawed segregation in public accommodations the vra and the <number> fair housing act that ended redlining and housing discrimination nixon was able to exploit white resentment about this and you see a lot of experimentation among leaders about how to address this with things like the william f buckley campaign for mayor in <number> and daleys response to mlks failed northern campaign in chicago nixon was able to figure out how to rally disaffected white voters on a number of causes like crime and protesting groups as a whole this was the height of anti vietnam war protesting and left wing violence like the sla and the weatherman and the civil rights movement ken phillips died last year in the fall and there are a ton of articles looking back at his work and the southern strategy theyre good to read through bc you can see what he actually did and that it wasnt as effective as he had hoped now instead of being a national party the gop is somewhat stuck as a regional southern and rural party and tied to white resentment but whether he was successful or not in his goals to make a national party with broad appeal to white voters the strategy did very much create a perception that the gop is for old white guys and the dems are the party of civil rights interview with josh farrington about his book black republicans its a good history of black people in the gop <url> leah wright rigeur interview about her book the loneliness of the black republican it does a good job of telling the story of the cow palace convention in san francisco <url> matthew demont interview about half american his book gets into the black american experience of wwii and although not directly on topic it gives a lot of good background information <url> sort of related to that thomas ricks has a book out called waging a good war that talks about how important a lot of wwii vets were to the crm and what lessons they brought to the movement you can find interviews of that anywhere bc hes a pretty popular author heres one with steve innskeep <url> michelle nickerson interview about her book mothers of conservatism she explains how fears of integration in affluent areas like orange county helped people like goldwater and then reagan and nixon <url> interview with nick buccola about his great book the fire is upon us that deals with the william f buckley and james baldwin debate and goes into buckleys campaign <url> article on ken phillips after his passing that looks at the southern strategy <url> jonathan eig has a new biography of mlk out thats not

well theres lots of ways one could go about this the men were of two different political parties and two separate political movements ill briefly skim just some of the ways the differences should be understood bryan was a populist which was popular with western farmers and his nomination as the democrat presidential candidate was kind of like if bernie sanders had won the <number> primary in terms of impact a lot of the stuff the populists were pursuing was for the relief of western farmers the most famous of their policies would be bimetalism where they pursued basing american currency off of a gold and a silver standard this would increase the money supply and also lead to inflation as more money poured into the system producers such as american farmers supported inflationary politics because it meant they could sell their produce at higher costs and then use that money to pay off their bank loans banks were opposed to this because they would lose out on the loan repayments with inflation causing them to be worth less than they wouldve been when issued hence the bryan v mckinley election was viewed as one of populist antieconomic policies vs the party of big business and prosperity theres other famous populist policies such as direct election of senators but the money debate is probably the most famous william jenning bryans legendary cross of gold speech was about the gold vs bimetallist currency debate la follette was a bit of a populist in his own right but he was associated more with the progressives progressives were technocrats associated with alleviating the contradictions and oppression of capitalism through government reform while a populist would turn to the people and rile up the crowd about how unfair banks are a progressive would be someone more likely to pull out charts and evidence and describe the exact detailed policy that would appease farmers without having to antagonize banks its a rather subtle distinction that i hope i am getting across but it is fascinating imo if one wanted to you could draw the comparison between bidens presidency as a progressive one rather than a populist one that people expected out of a bernie presidency i would caution against going too far with that analogy since these are two very different political and social contexts but it may help give you an idea both the populists and progressives as the left wings of liberalism would occasionally have support from socialists and other anticapitalist movements even if the solutions either group would pursue would have subtle but important differences to give one last example a populist would want to improve peoples lives by putting more power and money in the hands of common everyday farmers while progressives would want to improve peoples lives by reducing tariffs to decrease prices and legislating quality of life improvements such as government sanitation and health programs,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyT1pkZVl1RFBSd3paZTVEdVJxRXZlQzZpZzB6VGRSLWVTQ18yWXdEZUtFMnpsQWdBTFlSZXVYaVRGQ3NpZExxLVViZS1ibDRrQUktZDJQOEdTVi1pa2c9PQ==

well let me start by putting it this way it wasnt that the parties themselves switched so much as the populations they represented changed the united states doesnt have real political parties as they exist anywhere else in the world instead they operate as loose confederations of different state parties that come together and endorse specific candidates a candidate is not beholden to any sort of actual party discipline and thus the parties have only recently become more ideologically driven and a lot of issues we seen in political discourse since the <number>s is that party leadership is still pulling on these old levers that dont really do anything anymore so to take that apart a bit more if we were to look at say <number>s<number>s you would find conservative and progressive wings in both parties the labels arent exact and should be understand as posthoc classifications like most historical labels are im going to pause a moment to get into how the two parties should be understood in order to understand their left and right wings the republicans had their origin in the collapse of the whigs in the late antebellum period and they arose as a sort of procapital and probusiness party ranging from the small scale quasilassallism of yeoman frontier farmers represented by the likes of lincoln and the protocapitalists who would emerge as the great winners of the american civil war the progressive wing of the republicans came more from that whiglincoln tradition that believed more in empowering the individual through access to the land and the governments task of helping to build a society such men could thrive in the conservative wing was more overtly capitalist in its interest you could view teddy roosevelt as coming from that progressive left wing of the party but william mckinley and calvin coolidge came from that conservative right wing of the party cont,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzNmNWZFBUbUg1eVhpbDctZFhCWXNYWUVrYUd6VkVCUEMzWEVyMUZzRjRrRkNwcFMtUnVQZGVhRDhhZkxkSWhJbDc4SmNxd0JyTHQtR2NGNjdGenFUM3c9PQ==
the democrats however were older and dated back to the second generation of american political leadership chiefly andrew jackson and martin van buren they were the party of the common white man through the former with all of the social conservatism and racism that entailed and the party of the political machine through the latter that is how democrats also came to be associated as the party of white immigrants since those populations would make up key voting blocs of their political machine the progressive movement in both parties arose from the contradictions and horrors of capitalist development in the postcivil war gilded age the arguments used and even the policies pursued would differ between democrat and republican progressives but the basic idea of trying to improve the ills of society through technocratic legal management directed by highly educated intellectuals and academics was more or less the common goal the conservative republicans the more overtly probusiness wing would have their heyday in the interwar period of the <number>s and <number>s in the presidencies of harding coolidge and hoover although hoover is a bit more of an interesting case they would fall out of favor in the aftermath of the great depression and the rise of new deal politics the new deal coalition brought progressive energies mostly into the democratic party under the leadership of the elder progressive fdr the party machine itself eventually adopted fdrs progressivism as seen two later political leaders who were party men harry truman and lbj versus fdr who was a classical progressive and jfk who was an idealistic rich kid the conservative republicans would strike back against the progressives in <number> and the rise of movement conservatism most closely associated with barry goldwater as the democrats alienated their conservative faction with the civil rights movement of the <number>s it led to the conservatives coalescing into the republican party under nixon in the <number>s as a reaction to the <number>s and then more completely under reagan in the victory of conservative neoliberalism over socialism and keynesian progressivism in the <number>s although to be fair keynesian economics saw its collapse in the <number>s under ford and carter,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzN2labUtEWFhsNHlzVGgzVzA0UHN0WmI0R2pEWmU3ZmhHM19BaHJBSXBBb09TVk9oWnduaW9OTVg2bE4yZkttTlNlWExsNFZiWmpFWjNFOVNZVjRtSnc9PQ==

statements like that ring equally true for much of antiquity even during the heyday of the roman empire singling out just the medieval era in that sense always feels a bit disingenuous in that light,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0Z3hMVmdOT2ZmeGQtVEl2c1VOeU5leDk5VTVtSE96YkdPMUFfN2ZSSTNoZnlGdDVKTU1lOXcwcEprajVfMHREdWQ4cC1JaTNKZ0lmOVp6Nl93R3Uyc2c9PQ==
the problem is that the eras didnt progress in all areas equally eg the antiguity was happening only around the meditaeran the regions outside roman and greece influence remained in prehistory but the beginning of the middle ages is considered universal for whole world the sacking of rome <number> and frankly it doesnt make sense different regions of the world progressed into medieval at different times roman regions in <number> middle east in <number> etc and some regions of europe didnt enter middle ages until th century so a separate term dark ages has some logic to it im not a professional historician so i dont know if theres such consensus but i believe it should middle ages for regions which already progressed into medieval dark ages for regions which were still prehistoricantique despite the date being after <number>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0VTE5bUU2Wm54R0JIaklZVjVLelRiMXZoOC1fRUJ4b2VCWFpjREJJbU5Kd1FqNzhfQ3hhd0VDaHY0dDFzdG9xaGNsYXVxZXFZdDN6ckZ5VnBSLXhuOEE9PQ==
but the term medieval and dark ages within that timeframe can hardly be said to be universal or paneuropean for that matter either no so i still find the term not that universally applicable certainly locally in terms of a dearth of sources like britain after the roman withdrawal regions like francia and italy however retained a more continued stream of documentation if lesser in volume,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0M3JnWXg3bURSSXBCZ2RjMHVKQnM5Vzh2U1pNMDY0d3A1M3Q1RThTVF9KN3ZDa1ZkT1N5NUZTd0R4X3dnNTAzQi1yMXNxdlZRcmEzM01BNnVSczhqdlE9PQ==
its the best we have its not perfect but nobody came up with something better after antiquity the progress of europe was heavily fractured and describing it with one term is never going to be precise perhaps more precise than term middle ages is the separation of eras based on architecture roman romanesque gothic but there arent many records of architecture between <number>th century so we are back to dark ages,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0OWdVNVBCNm5EOHdkQV90ZWtwX1E0MTRWUGpFdzBjdDFqZVNTTGt3ME9rZlZCM0F5YmJET0RLbVh2X0dVaEVMNW9rQXQ3Z0pyYWZ1a3FxdEFmSVdqV2c9PQ==

hi as we hope you can appreciate the holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with while we dont want to curtail discussion we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit outright holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head as such the rhistory mods have created this brief overview it is not intended to stifle further discussion but simply lay out the basic incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way what was the holocaust the holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of <number><number> million european jews carried out systematically by nazi germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during world war ii some historians will also include the deaths of the roma communists mentally disabled and other groups targeted by nazi policies which brings the total number of deaths to <number><number> million debates about whether or not the holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred but this guy says otherwise unfortunately there is a small but vocal minority of persons who fall into the category of holocaust denial attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude impugn well proven facts or even claim that the holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened although they often selfstyle themselves as revisionists they are not correctly described by the title while revisionism is not inherently a dirty word actual revision to quote michael shermer entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events rarely complete denial of the events themselves and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the holocaust it is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in <number> or so you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject and that is the result of good revisionism but these changes which even can be quite large such as the reassessment of deaths at auschwitz from ~<number> million to ~<number> million are done within the bounds of respected academic study and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections there are still plenty of questions within holocaust studies that are debated by scholars and there may still be more out there for us to discover and revise but when it comes to the basic facts there is simply no valid argument against them so what are the basics beginning with their rise to power in the s the nazi party headed by adolf hitler implemented a series of antijewish policies within germany marginalizing jews within society more and more stripping them of their wealth livelihoods and their dignity with the invasion of poland in <number> the number of jews under nazi control reached into the millions and this number would again increase with the invasion of the soviet union in <number> shortly after the invasion of poland the germans started to confine the jewish population into squalid ghettos after several plans on how to rid europe of the jews that all proved unfeasible by the time of the invasion of the soviet union in <number> ideological antisemitism and pragmatic resources considerations lead to masskillings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the nazi leadership first only practiced in the ussr it was influential groups such as the ss and the administration of the general government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of europe and sometime at the end of <number> met with hitlers approval the early killings were carried out foremost by the einsatzgruppen paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the ss and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of jews communists and other undesirable elements in the wake of the german militarys advance in what is often termed the holocaust by bullet the einsatzgruppen with the assistance of the wehrmacht the sd the security police as well as local collaborators would kill roughly two million persons over half of them jews most killings were carried out with mass shootings but other methods such as gas vans intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day were utilized too by early <number> the final solution to the socalled jewish question was essentially finalized at the wannsee conference under the direction of reinhard heydrich where the plan to eliminate the jewish population of europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied poland was presented and met with approval construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall and mass extermination mostly as part of operation reinhard had began operation by spring of <number> roughly <number> million persons nearly all jewish men women and children were immediately gassed upon arrival at bezec sobibor and treblinka over the next two years when these reinhard camps were closed and razed more victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as chemno but most infamously at auschwitzbirkenau where slightly over <number> million persons mostly jews died under the plan set forth at wannsee exterminations were hardly limited to the jews of poland but rather jews from all over europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter although the victims of the reinhard camps were originally buried they would later be exhumed and cremated and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as auschwitz the camps there were two main types of camps run by nazi germany which is sometimes a source of confusion concentration camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the nazis shortly after taking power beginning with the construction of dachau in <number> political opponents of all type not just jews could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the prewar years and while conditions were often brutal and squalid and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly although concentration camps were later made part of the final solution their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers some were way stations and others were work camps where germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as extermination through labor jews and other undesirable elements if deemed healthy enough to work could find themselves spared for a time and allowed to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end although some concentration camps such as mauthausen did include small gas chambers mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp many camps becoming extremely overcrowded nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus or starvation all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent bergenbelsen which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count saw some <number> deaths caused by the conditions often located in the reich camps liberated by the western forces were exclusively concentration camps and many survivor testimonies come from these camps the concentration camps are contrasted with the extermination camps which were purpose built for mass killing with large gas chambers and later on crematoria but little or no facilities for inmates often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits such as at bezec where only seven jews forced to assist in operation of the camp were alive after the war several camps however were hybrids of both types the most famous being auschwitz which was vast a complex of subcamps the infamous selection of prisoners conducted by ss doctors upon arrival meant life or death with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve the death count at auschwitz numbered around <number> million but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies how do we know running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here but suffice to say there is a lot of evidence and not just the mountains of survivor testimony we have testimonies and writings from many who participated as well german documentation of the programs this site<url> catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass

if a majority of the perpetrators were women why is the phenomenon still seen as misogynistic fyi women can be misogynistic too misogynistic is defined as a person who dislikes despises or is strongly prejudiced against women the fact that majority of the perpetrators were women is irrelevant to the fact that all the victims were women the victims were attacked because they were women that makes it misogynistic,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQzSzRJRzBKekU2anBXRFgtZHM4aE81NGtCU1FvZl94VFpxNlM0cFRzLURZUFE1ZjEzOWxRR0xsR3d1cV9XV19lNTZoX0NqSzg3ckFRbXBmZGJLNkNSMmFOM2ZNS20tTG94b01LbzM2QkNQa2s9

yep i understand the frustration most of history taught in school has to compromise with the vastity of topics to cover and the very few hours at disposal and then its normal to not cover the topics but with a superficiality that does not delves deeper than the major polical happenings the reality luckily its pretty different with historians having developed a sensibility for the life of people that national histories rarely had in the eight hundred all the titles i gave you are not too technical i started with those and found them pretty enjoyable the pace is similar to asimovs foundation maybe habermas and weisnerhanks are a little more boring but the latter would be the first i reccomand you to read anyway i would avoid things not written by historians even thought some amatorial works are scientifically sound they should at least have a well researched bibliography,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQzdFE5RWZCb1hiNVBxNXV4NEdUVkpHeTZmMERHQ0NvTUFpLTlNMTFsUWdhNWJFRXlMTGszQVlaelhlcEpfYXQ2UkFNdDU3WldRQ3JSeTMtTTNWaDVuWGViVzJVUmdLSjhZWVBMT0t0ZFIwbEE9

academic article <url> >abstract the identification of ceramic forming techniques poses challenges particularly when different primary and secondary forming techniques are combined or when specific surface treatments obscure potential diagnostic features as emphasized in the existing literature a comprehensive approach should consider all potential sources of information in this study we employed a combination of macroscopic observations and xray microct analysis on experimental cups reproduced using the complex technology attested in middle bronze age crete ie a combination of handbuilding technique and potters wheel our investigation focuses on the potential of microct scanning in unveiling forming techniques in wheelthrown and wheelfashioned ceramics our results indicate that integrating the visualization of d thickness variation in vessel walls quantification of d wall thickness distribution in longitudinal virtual slices identification of possible structural joints in virtual sections and evaluation of voids orientation with traditional macroscopic analysis generally allows for the recognition of primary forming techniques and the reconstruction of complex ceramic technological processes,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ1WF93MVE3dkljVE02SjZ0NVgzVlUtbmxObGlrSEotQUZTWUdDdXhUOFlQZ1NFYlBwYVR0WGdQQ1RWc0t0Z2FoSzU2THItMWtHclJMa3hiNWRhRDdJV1E9PQ==

finished the books ive been reading over the previous weeks one i would recommend and one i wouldnt reviews copied from my goodreads berlin portrait of a city through the centuries by rory maclean ><number><number> >it was ok the book covers the history of berlin from around <number> to the present day each of the chapters focuses on an individuals life in the city some of these people are well known while others are very obscure >some of the book is fictionalised so its not all real history which is a big flaw the writing is a bit too flowery and pretentious for my tastes the book is a bit too focused on the arts actors writers etc and not enough on politics for my taste as well >some of the chapters were decent i liked the chapters on marlene dietrich and leni riefenstahl the most there was also a decent one about a loyal communist in east berlin during the cold war >overall i wouldnt recommend it due to some of the book being fictional there are probably better books about the history of berlin out there but this was a book i bought as it was cheap i didnt seek it out so i have nothing to compare it to and vertigo the rise and fall of weimar germany by harald jahner ><number><number> >it is very good the book is well written and just under <number> pages its mainly a socialcultural history of weimar germany with some politics and economics thrown in a lot of the book is about the mood of the time and how the various crises of the weimar republic made people feel the hatred seething in returning wwi soldiers who joined the freikorps the moral decline and confusion caused by hyperinflation in <number> apathy from unemployment or fear of unemployment driving remaining workers towards the nazis >normally im not that interested in cultural history the arts i mean but i thought this book did the topic as well as the arts are tied into the wider vibe of the weimar republic and the political debates of the time for example in the architecture chapter it mentions a pretty silly culture war of the day between people who preferred flat roofs or pointy roofs nationalists and conservatives tended to prefer pointy tying the arts and culture to wider society and politics meant chapters on topics i normally have no interest in like dancing worked well imo >there was an interesting chapter later on in the book about the change in mood following the great depression it basically says that the cultural progressivenessmodernity of the weimar era was in retreat well before the nazis took over dances and music became more slower traditional womens hair cuts mostly reverted to pres styles longer skirts etc the nazi bans on things like jazz were targeting things that were already in decline in germany >the last sections of the book are more politically focused and cover the failure of the republic and the rise of the nazis >the book isnt that heavy on statistics or policy which i think works in this instance as it is more of a socialcultural history >overall highly recommend it if youre interested in the weimar republic continuing with my bought new german history books im now onto germany <number> by volker ulrich seems good so far but i havent finished the first chapter on the french occupation of the ruhr yet,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBNl9tY3FqTE1yUnFTQ21BX0RLcUFkSFp0bG1BSVB0YWRwczlyUVVRYTZOQU93b00ySnBzWmZMTV9tX0VXeEVZdGRHUjRZRVUyN0dDS09Jb3RxQkJJVVE9PQ==

stone sure but this is clay basically the bronze age and beyond to a degree equivalent of paper and plastic they used it from everything from pottery so food and drink containers to building material at that time they would write on it while it was still malleable and then fire it to make it last we find it a lot because it doesnt degrade in the earth nearly as much as paper or papyrus but it is common and cheap so it doesnt get reused once it gets thrown away like good cut stone so we find a lot of it though i think this is before papyrus was commonly used but dont quote me on that i couldnt tell you for sure off the top of my head,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCTVlibFEtdmt2OHZWQk9uYzQwMmtIOWxZcHlaRmxUWGZiUHotRmR3OVpsTlc3b3pCZk1pd01LNTdxUTVydEZ3Qi0tV3VIa0pOUmlqNEVveE5BVU9hQVE9PQ==

>at that time they would write on it while it was still malleable and then fire it to make it last its been a while since ive been reading up on the subject but iirc clay tablets were typically not fired but simply allowed to dry and presumably reused all or at least most of the fired ones we ended up with are from unintentional conflagrations where the buildings the tablets were stored in burned down edit apparently clay tablets were at least sometimes fired intentionally in mesopotamia but never in the minoanmycenaean world which is what i did some university courses on interestingly researchers are debating firing ancient unfired tablets now as that would greatly help with preservation,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCamlpd3RYamx6TXdkQWdhWGdZa09JSzBSdU5GVTN0MVplRmpxS2oyU1VHU2pqTHFyU21NS2VaUktkTHh2dmJac3llUndJNmE0dTJoa2h6NVZMWW9MSUE9PQ==

im not a historian but i dont think it would have been that bad they had trade routes and a lot of shipping was done over water so fairly quickly depending on location if the clay tablet was sort of an order form the buyer would just send a messenger with the money and the order and the furniture would be shipped back i imagine the toil you mean is having to order the furniture online if not and you mean that you had to go in person for your furniture the process the claytabletwriting person went through might have even been easier if talking about ordering honestly its not that much quicker the only difference is the communication would be happening instantly but still you still have to wait for shipping nowadays so what does it matter if the order gets there in seconds or a week if youve got to wait for weeks to get the items anyway,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVDSGI1bGIybHJZUy1QcFk0WnZyN1F0TGtqZlBSbnF1alJXSlJuUWZSWTdkR1UwQk9fLWd6M0doZ2VvSk9LaHRkSFhLMHpMRTdHY0hzdExZNTItMndSNG5CS2c1eFV2VTNkbHZEeTdSQ1RJOGs9

afghanistan is often referred to as the graveyard of empires while central asia can be seen as the graveyard of singular nationalist histories the sogdians exemplify this being one of the most significant diasporas in human history rivaling even that of india in the th century ce kabul was ruled by hindu turk shahs to the north across the oxus amu darya river lay a collection of citystates engaged in trade and conflict among them were the sogdians who practiced various religions including buddhism mazdaism zoroastrianism christianity and judaism alongside them were diverse diasporas from central south west and east asia speaking a mix of languages primarily iranic with many indic influences these overlooked groups remind us that the past was a world without borders in the shadow of the kushans to grasp the significance of the sogdians during their peak in the th and th centuries ce we must first understand their earlier obscurity <number> years prior the kushan empire was a dominant force across the gangetic plains afghanistan and parts of xinjiang controlling key trade routes connecting the indian subcontinent to persia the roman empire and distant china overland trade to china involved navigating the perilous taklamakan desert trading through the desert was fraught with risk as noted by historian valerie hansen in the silk roads a new history transactions typically involved highvalue commodities in small quantities yet these could yield substantial profits judith a lerner and thomas wilde emphasize that items like horses from the ferghana valley gemstones from india musk from tibet and furs from the northern steppes were highly sought after in the ancient world historian etienne de la vassiere describes the kushan empire as a brilliant urban civilization that outshone the very mediocre situation of sogdiana roughly corresponding to modernday southwest uzbekistan and eastern tajikistan at that time sogdiana was relatively isolated from the major trade routes leading across the taklamakan desert while kushan merchants thrived in horse trading as far afield as china and southeast asia nevertheless sogdian traders began to integrate into these networks establishing roots in kushan cities while preserving connections to their homeland de la vassiere points out that sogdian graffiti discovered along the karakoram highway built between presentday pakistan and china indicates their settlement in the upper indus river region by the rd century ce one notable piece of graffiti is a sogdian merchants prayer to a local spirit for safe passage to visit his brother these familial networks provided sogdians with access to capital and market insights giving them a competitive edge simultaneously sogdians began to make their mark in china historian xinriu liu highlights in a silk road legacy the spread of buddhism and islam that the earliest buddhist monks in china were sogdians not native indians in the nd and rd centuries ce they worked in china translating texts from sanskrit to chinese de la vassiere adds that buddhism wasnt a dominant force in sogdiana at that time suggesting these sogdian monks were likely from merchant families that had settled in india where they adopted buddhism and sanskrit before moving to china hindu gods in samarkand though the concepts surrounding indian gods are ancient they were never fixed entities various groups worshipped and patronized them influencing their evolution this is evident in buddhism and similarly applies to other contemporary religions including hinduism for instance the kushans portrayed skanda as mahasena meaning great general the sogdians influenced by this kushan environment returned to their cities with a blend of religious traditions that merged local iranic fireworship with new elements preserving a distinct sogdian identity samarkand now in uzbekistan and once the greatest sogdian citystate serves as an example based on the accounts of the famous chinese pilgrim xuanzang liu argues that in samarkand the buddha was honored with processions featuring torches and firebrands by the th century although the kushan empire had fragmented sogdian diaspora networks thrived and grew in influence by the th and th centuries sogdians had become leading foreign traders in china and their distinctive costumes and dance forms gained popularity in the cosmopolitan tang dynasty at the same time there were notable south asian communities in sogdiana with indian monks achieving success in china the wealth of sogdiana is evident in the mansions of affluent merchants adorned with intricate frescoes depicting gods myths and even stories from the panchatantra sogdian interactions with foreign deities mirrored the dynamics of the kushan empire while the kushans adoption of indian gods was driven by the imperial court in sogdiana this was a more decentralized process led by various merchant elites indian conceptions influenced the gods worshipped in sogdiana while kushan influences shaped the deities venerated in india the zoroastrian gods of the sogdians had diverse attributes and the established indian artistic norm of multiple arms and faces provided a framework for their representation in iranian gods in hindu garb art historian frantz grenet cites buddhist sogdian texts mentioning composite deities like brahmazurwan indraadhvagh mahadevawesparkar their iconography primarily influenced by indian models includes traits such as brahmazurwan with a beard indraadhvagh featuring a third eye and mahadevawesparkar having three faces this last deity draws from the ancient kushan composite god oesosiva merging a cosmic wind god with the supreme shiva in panjikent a significant sogdian city in modern tajikistan mahadevawesparkar is depicted blowing a horn emphasizing the connection to wind these cultural exchanges were intricate not as a result of deliberate design but as an organic assimilation process over centuries layers of influences accumulated in various directions grenet argues that some motifs traveled from the gangetic region to kushan contexts before reaching sogdiana consequently thcentury sogdians may not have viewed these motifs or composite deities as indian or foreign to them these representations were simply part of their local context it is only through a modern lens that associates specific religions with singular languages peoples and regions that the sogdian pantheon appears unusual however the silent frescoes of dancing shiva in panjikent and depictions of elephantriding gods battling tigers and leopards in varaksha challenge us to perceive this ancient world beyond nationalist narratives these connections while not reinforcing contemporary notions of superiority or exclusivity enrich our understanding of our ancestors world and by extension our

hi it seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false winners write history trope while the expression is sometimes true in one sense well get to that in a bit it is rarely if ever an absolute truth and particularly not in the way that the concept has found itself commonly expressed in popular history discourse when discussing history and why some events have found their way into the history books when others have not simply dismissing those events as the imposed narrative of victors actually harms our ability to understand history you could say that is in fact a somewhat lazy way to introduce the concept of bias which this is ultimately about because whoever writes history is the one introducing their biases to history a somewhat better but absolutely not perfect approach that works better than winners writing history is to say writers write history this is more useful than it initially seems until fairly recently the literate were a minority and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that to give a few examples genghis khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes similarly the norsemen historically have been portrayed as uncivilized barbarians as the people that wrote about them were the losers whose monasteries got burned down of course writers are a diverse set and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias the painful truth is each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits this evaluation is something that is done by historians and part of what makes history and why insights about historical events can shift over time this is possibly best exemplified by those examples where victors did unambiguously write the historical sources the spanish absolutely wrote the history of the conquest of central america from <number> and the reports and diaries of various conquistadores and priests are still important primary documents for researchers of the period but victors write the history presupposes that we still use those histories as they intended which is simply not the case it both overlooks the fundamental nature of modern historical methodology and ignores the fact that while victors have often proven to be predominant voices they have rarely proven to be the only voices archaeology numismatics works in translation and other records all allow us at least some insight into the losers viewpoint as does careful analysis of the winners records we know far more about rome than we do about phoenician carthage there is still vital research into carthage as its being a daily topic of conversation on this subreddit testifies to so while its true that the balance between the voices can be disparate that doesnt mean that the winners are the only voice or even the most interesting which is why stating that history is written by the victors and leaving it at that is harmful to the understanding of history and the process of studying history i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposeto=rhistory if you have any questions or concerns,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVaDJfZElEa291WFZpbGxPNS1nbkZYX3hVY254Ujk0WDZmTHFudjdyVmFieVptVVh6Uk8zbTkxVW5EdG90NkFxc1lGOUdVanZUQndIM2F1UnJtUWp1c2c9PQ==

calling it hinduism during this period is very very strange as hinduism didnt really exist as a concept until british colonialism hinduism is a conglomeration of a ton of different traditions some directly competing and contradictory those traditions certainly existed but calling these gods hindu gods is a bit of a misnomer no i dunno im just very weary of any source thats western that feeds into the colonial viewpoint on the religion during the past few decades as the people of the indian subcontinent try to figure out how they want to stand with their religious traditions it would be like calling allat a muslim deity or cybele a christian one,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVWXVXb2gyaUNFUGRQc3dVQXdYMTJ3NWdPMEc0ODNVbXVpN3BnNS0xT0VrZjN2MHpXQUhJdjFpOWJYRWdnbjZaVW95Y3J2WDBpTGQ5YUxNSTVXUFhrSmc9PQ==

purpose to determine the identity of the prototypical blind man repeatedly described by philosopher john locke <number><number> methods historical books were reviewed results in several works john locke described a studious man he knew who went blind from smallpox at a young age this man struggled to understand visual concepts such as the yellow color of saffron the clarity of the sun or the color of scarlet which the man compared to a trumpet nonconformist minister john troughton <number><number> went blind from smallpox at a young age troughton was a fellow student with locke at oxford university troughtons sermons quoted the exact portions in song of solomon canticles <number><number> and revelations chapter <number> which contain the imagery and the association of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets found in lockes writings thus lockes comparison of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets was probably not a description of synesthesia but rather was an attempt of a blind scholar to understand biblical imagery conclusions the struggles of blind nonconformist minister john troughton to understand biblical imagery probably stimulated john locke to ponder what humans can know innately about vision independent of experience,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVXN0lIOEV4WGdvRXBxM2h6UUhnVFQ1cGowNlNtZ1pfZFZSandjMXBTV0l4QTJneXhBYWVuLWhoQkhub00wSGVDLXIxbmpnd0ZvSWl2Y1B4Y3ZybW1HMXc9PQ==

the whole sphinx conspiracy is a game of telephone where misunderstanding has grown out of proportion to create a mystery where there is not one the sphinx was built on top of an existing natural rock formation that natural rock formation is where the ancient weather patterns evidence came from this was exciting because it suggested that there may have been an existing tradition of worship at that site long before the sphinx was created giving hints about early egyptian ritual culture then word of mouth garbled this into saying that the sphinx itself is <number> years old,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVYclBsWmlMZ3hGSUNXMXg4dHpoTkdqTE5GZWtKaFEzdVE3M0x5OEZLbXpETXJ1Nk9aSHZSRUwxbmtrc2JFel9OWVNseGRONmVKRXlUN3JiQTdFVDUyNkE9PQ==

im no expert but i dont think your claims about amazonian civilization are correct the conquistadors knew at least a little about the antisuyu and its people and also knew about at least some of its cities seeing as they chased manco inca to vitcos several times this knowledge did survive until the time of bingham as he was specifically searching for vilcabamba,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVYU3l0THdKYjliOEEzdVBMNG5mM181S2RhR2x0MWozOE04OVk2VFNlbDlkS1EtaE1jMlZRZFoyTmhEY2dwTjBKU1ZnbndfX1Ixa1UxeVhfYW5BRWg4YXdzQlNKWDBtOUpURzFLbjJVR0U5a1U9

yes there are records from the conquistadors that they saw huge citys with millions of people but that has unfortunately largely been dismissed and looked upon as exaggerated and not to be taken seriously bingham went on his expedition around the same time that percy fawcett did his first expedition after he maped the amazon river and found some clay pottery he was then convince that there was a lost civilisation in the jungel when he shows the pottery to the academics he was laughed at and they minimised his findings with its just pots a pans a lot of their refusal of an old civilization in the amazon came from a place of racism lost city of z is a good movie about percy fawcett and his obsession with his lost city hes a bit glorified in it though even into to the s they would consider what was written by the conquistadors to be largy exaderated,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVYUDJadklXczVJajctTUtYem5RZEJfZkNfNmtCWElWRHRqRF9NMF80Y2RsRUlYYVRwcjg1VVk3V2JtdHBEbnF4aG0tRTBsUjh4QmFubENacWJwRlRUd2VtRTdIOTMwTWxlMFJacDV0TVl1UVk9

i wouldnt really call critias scribbles or hallucinations its clearly a metaphor about political order and about cultivating the virtues that are outlined in the education system of the republic the atlantis aspect is almost certainly just used as a metaphor to contrast the ordered and unordered life with the ordered life athenians and zeuss laws superior to the disordered life atlantis and poseidons emotions its relation to timaeus which looks at similar themes in the order of nature and physics and platos earlier dialogues like the phaedrus crito and the republic joins it in a larger discussion about ethics and living the good life atlantis isnt really important in the dialogue its a teaching tool and similar to what earlier teachers like xenocrates and heraclides of pontus had done,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVYSDlnR09pUUxSbF9GWnI2Uk9rVldUajJaVFBqWS1vMTFqTjdPVGo4UUVXSmZhUEVnZVEwNkhlQ1hreDlyN3JWdDlYUzBid05MNjZPQmp0bHFtRDNnU0E9PQ==

unfortunately i dont have a source i can cite of hand i have to look through the materials i have i studied archaeology for one semester and going back now again although it focuses mostly on scandinavian archaeology and a bit of european theres a lot we get to learn about the field itself and how its looked at things through history since it became a thing im really bad att keeping track of sources but what i can give you is to watch lost worlds of south america on the great courseswondrium by edwin barnhart although his main focus is the maya its <number> ep <number> minutes lectures so if your interested i really recommend it its from <number> so it might be a lite outdated on some things like the size of citys for exampel if you take gobekli tepe as an example of academics not wanting to change their opinion when people started talking about an ancient civilisation around <number> thousand years a go they basically laughed at it and said it was impossible for megalithic structure to be older than <number> thousand years old if there where they would have found it already or at least traces of it and then in <number> they dated gobekli tepe to <number> years old but if theres one thing i know is that racism has played a major role of the views of early archeology,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVYUV9ZOG9HeGJTalo1QTR2SlJnbkswcHQ2U0pTaFhsdUJ1SlFpSXNmeFNnSWRoZXA5MjVNaEctZHNuNnMxNDRiRXE1cVZDWEFXbll5LU44bEJQanMtUWdIaXE3SXBXdnptaC1fa3FMMXBkdlE9

there are definitely people who do ancient history and law at the same time at university its a fairly popular undergrad at my university but if youve already decided you only want to do it as a hobby then theres really no rush hobbies dont have exams homework or deadlines so just take time when you have it and want to the quickest way to ruin a hobby is to make it seem like work but you still want to feel like youre progressing id suggest finding some academic works instead of popular history if youre studying law you should be able to follow them those will give you a better understanding and more of the complex understandings rather than just a wall of facts<number> that popular history tends to bring <number>the facts are often wrong oversimplified or very misleading in popular history too we have our bookclub thread here pinned at the top of the sub and refreshed each wednesday you can ask for academic book suggestions in topics there and read what other people have been reading lately see if something piques your interest and check out that book too if so,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmX2xDcEJtaXFwXy1LSzhabmpkTWZ3TVp0eDNmSWQtcmtWcWcxblRqemJ2YmJDdHVkUlh2RXZiSVFDNC1aNXJkZEJlX2NKTzE3QzA2eFBONlQzdndwVnc9PQ==

while there were no formal public education systems in place in the roman empire to specifically target improving literacy among the lower classes there were some efforts to provide education to a broader segment of society one notable initiative was the establishment of schools by wealthy individuals or benefactors in some urban areas these schools though not widespread aimed to provide basic education to children from lowerincome families additionally some emperors such as augustus promoted educational reforms to encourage literacy and learning furthermore certain professions like scribes required literacy skills so some individuals from lower classes would learn to read and write as part of their trade or occupation despite these efforts the overall literacy rates among the lower classes remained significantly lower compared to the elite and upper classes in roman society,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoLXl5T2JGbnVxVW1sQmdITFNvUDBtVEVVaU1aelRpZS1MVmRraHZxRFpBZzc5YmtTcHYzcVE1aXNzR1NhWFFaSXQ2NVpEOUtTVnAzb0hMVmpIQy1CVjJrRFVsRTRvSGVvUkUzY0VRZ0FpYjg9

im reading micheners carribean theres a chapter that follows victor hugues at the time of the french revolution michener keeps referring to him as a former barber which doesnt seem to be accurate he does caution that hugues early life is not well known but it seems like he took a lot of liberties here also he depicts a battle which brought part of guadeloupe back under french control which opposes hugues to a certain admiral oldmixon who is supposed to be from a family of planters from barbados except this guy never existed and we know the name of the actual british commander and he was not from barbados at all i find all those inconsistencies for the sake of romanticisation quite confusing if not upsetting im not reading this as a scholar and i know its not entirely accurate but i feel like its going too far is that a reasonable take should i keep going or try some more factual if less engaging account of carribean history any recommendations thanks,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV4QnVZT2lpOW92WEh1eW5JT3FmNlZEM1QwZnpfek9MTExmTjR1Z2RkSnpnTnQ5V29ramRVakd5X0otVlJkZEhIMllsbjF1X1BYVzIyaG9qNTV0N1VhcEE9PQ==

as a science nerd i love the indiana jones atmosphere t=<number> in auto transcript<url> > you would see against the night sky or the dark sky of the outer universe silhouetted the ribs the ribs made of wood as thick as a parsiktu vessel of the wreck of the babylonian ark which like the one in the bible came to rest on a mountain speaking as a christian and this would equally apply for a jew or a muslim im aware of the dog whistle effect so am careful of the emotional appeal of the noahs ark story to my subset of the public its still interesting to see how scripture can be used by historians t=<number> in auto transcript<url> > in the cuneiform tablet signature they always said mr soandso son of mr soandso and the dad was called issuru now issuru is the babylonian word for bird now this is rather an interesting thing because we know all about peoples names in mesopotamia they usually meant something intelligible like servant of such and such a god or shes beautiful beyond compare no one is called bird theres no other case of a person called bird its not a very good name so what does that mean you look at this for the first time in the museum case which i hope you will now do and peer through and make out the details you would think ah i see its a sort of birdseye view of the world well i think thats what it is its a birdy birdy family and this is a birdseye view of the known world and what lies beyond it so that gives it a special kind of warmth of understanding because its failings as it were from a cartographical point of view are irrelevant it is not what theyre interested in and its given us a tremendous insight into many aspects of mesopotamian thinking > its also a triumphant demonstration of what happens when you have a very small totally uninformative and useless fragment of dead boring writing that no one can understand and you join it onto something in the collection which is much bigger and a whole new adventure begins all over again regarding the triumphant demonstration im still a little dubious of irving finkels conclusion about the bird and the birds eye view that looks like something from our culture which we are projecting upon theirs in the space tech domain that i know better bird is slang for satellite the solar panels looking like wings this includes the earth observation variety but babylonians had neither satellites nor tv drones is anybody else uncomfortable with seeing these ancient objects handled without gloves also this question of just pushing the recovered triangle into the hole in the tablet doesnt fit with a common idea of forensics then glueing it in there actually seemed worse what if a future researcher wanted to look at pollen or ancient chemical traces my first idea would have been to d scan all the fragments and let a computer do a virtual assembly such software exists and was famously used to reconstitute the shredded securitat archives from roumania <url> okay im a complete outsider to anything historical and am expecting to be quickly set to rights by people who actually know something but sometimes this kind of comment gets interesting replies am oblivious to voting patterns,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwNzhjdkZ1ak5MRlpMQ3p5eTN5ZG0xY2d5VWJicEV1SldvdlJPeUkyRndzLTdfeUNmT2xjNk5ENDFHMER6NkV2REJ4LWc3NW9HeVNOdjVncUJUbWU3Zmc9PQ==

direct references to medical issues are rare outside of physical injuries discussed in medical papyri but there is indirect evidence for damage to eyes for example votive stele dedicated by the artisans of deir elmedina suggest the villagers suffered from an unusual amount of eye problems something first remarked upon by battiscombe gunn over a century ago >two expressions for blindness are used in these texts to see darkness by day iv vi and to see a darkness of thy making viii xii xiii in the contexts in which they stand it is natural to take them as referring to physical blindness but if this interpretation be correct it is very strange that this affliction should occur proportionately so often and be at the same time the only one specified by the victims of divine retribution are we to infer that the decoration of the dark tombchambers of the necropolis for that was of course the work of the draughtsmen sculptors and perhaps of attendants of the placeoftruth was specially detrimental to the eyesight gunn b <number> the religion of the poor in ancient egypt the journal of egyptian archaeology vol <number> p <number>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUxRkNRV2Vsd3NfbW04UlJZZG1BSjh1YzI0VU93bEltWFZsLVhGQ0FweHhnc0RBcXlHZWxiZ09XMGs1SDEwbGpLNDdKMW9zaTY5cWY1TjlRekpUaDhwY1E9PQ==

this was a long but worthy read there was still a bit of fluff in there but overall a very enjoyable experience the argument of five different scribes is very interesting and would certainly change the view of many of the people who understandably consider it a forgery andor nonsense the new multidisciplinary approach which focuses on the small finds rather than an absolute translation is probably the best way to go about it at this point thanks for sharing,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUxOUd1M3puWUZQQllFbWRnT0pYUW5FazdaeEJFeXF6ZWs0X3p4SUcxemhWVXB2eWQ5SXdySHBSNWxINl8yMjdUU3dvdWxybzVGeWJQQ1BJRHBCWjhOdnc9PQ==

the first time i ever heard bout the voynich manuscript was in the s in this super cheap and probably quickly written book about conspiracy theories that was being sold in a grocery store anyway it said voynich was actually written by aliens in their language and they were just posing as humans being an idiot impressionable teenager and this being the s with it being much harder to fact check things i just sort of believed it because i was dumb i also think that book is why i spent several years in my late teens and early s as a hardcore believer in almost any conspiracy theory i heard roswell definitely aliens area <number> absolutely a testing ground for recovered alien technology chariots of the gods was practically my bible at one point and i took everything it said as gospel oh and unrelated but that same book said the antikythera mechanism was a navigation device from an alien spaceship that had accidentally been left behind on earth something i also believed for years anyway its interesting to read about the voynich manuscript from a sane point of view really cool article,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4ZFFUZDhNMHRUbG5ndDVFNVlXOXBZNUFnc2ZxYWlaa1loakk5cU1Bb2VZMGxzdWM2cHAyVU1WSTI0eTNzenZnRllCMWtfcGxKZHg0bmc3a29kU2o4SXc9PQ==

yes there are notable differences between the theses of brian murareskus the immortality key and john allegros the sacred mushroom and the cross despite both books dealing with the intersection of religious history and psychoactive substances heres a comparison of their key points <number> core thesis john allegro allegros thesis in the sacred mushroom and the cross is that early christianity was originally a secret fertility cult centered around the use of the psychoactive mushroom amanita muscaria he argued that the stories in the bible particularly the new testament are encoded references to mushroombased rituals and that jesus himself was a symbol rather than a historical figure allegros work is largely philological relying on speculative interpretations of ancient languages and etymologies to make his case brian muraresku murareskus thesis in the immortality key is more focused on the broader ancient mediterranean world rather than christianity alone he argues that certain religious practices particularly those associated with the eleusinian mysteries and early christianity involved the use of psychoactive potions which were central to the spiritual experiences of participants murareskus work is rooted in a combination of archaeological evidence ancient texts and modern scientific research <number> approach to evidence john allegro allegros approach is highly speculative and controversial he bases much of his argument on his interpretations of ancient languages particularly sumerian to draw connections between religious terms and psychoactive mushrooms his work has been criticized for its lack of rigorous evidence and for making leaps in logic that many scholars find unsubstantiated brian muraresku muraresku takes a more cautious and interdisciplinary approach he combines classical scholarship modern scientific analysis including chemical residue analysis on ancient artifacts and an exploration of historical texts to build his case his argument is more evidencebased though it still ventures into speculative territory when drawing conclusions about the exact nature of ancient religious practices <number> focus on christianity john allegro allegros work is almost entirely focused on early christianity he argues that christianity itself was fundamentally based on mushroom worship with all of its symbols rituals and narratives being allegories for psychoactive mushroom use brian muraresku while muraresku does discuss early christianity his focus is broader encompassing the religious practices of ancient greece particularly the eleusinian mysteries and their potential influence on early christian rituals he does not claim that christianity was a mushroom cult but rather that certain psychoactive substances played a role in early christian and prechristian religious experiences <number> reception and impact john allegro allegros book was met with widespread criticism from scholars and religious communities alike it damaged his academic reputation and his theories have largely been dismissed by mainstream scholars as highly speculative and lacking credible evidence brian muraresku murareskus book while controversial has been more positively received particularly among proponents of the emerging field of psychedelic studies it has sparked renewed interest in the possible connections between ancient religious practices and psychoactive substances though some scholars remain skeptical of his more speculative claims <number> religious interpretation john allegro allegros thesis is radical in its reinterpretation of christianity effectively arguing that the religion we know today is a misinterpretation or coverup of a psychedelic cult brian muraresku muraresku does not suggest that christianity as a whole is based on psychedelics but rather that these substances may have played a role in specific religious experiences or rites particularly in the context of mystery religions that may have influenced early christian practices in summary while both authors explore the connection between psychoactive substances and religion allegro presents a far more radical and narrowly focused thesis on early christianity grounded in linguistic speculation whereas muraresku takes a broader more evidencebased approach that places early christianity within a wider context of ancient religious practices that may have involved psychoactive substances,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4aHRrQXQzcGk2YWoxbHhYSURrbW50Sko3WXVhXzc2VUsxdnFVMVhpY0lzWERJNVR4bFhwVFEwbGRfcGtJSU9HUUF0MC1jTkNHUEVfSFk4dW1QRTFlaUE9PQ==

well theres quite a bit to unpack here for one thing witch hunts were not much of medieval thing the malleus was published at the very tail end of the middle ages and most witch hunts were a thing of the early modern period there were some earlier witch hunts and there were witchcraft and other magic accusations against specific people but the witch unts of pop culture mainly happened after the middle ages also it was not a phenomenon throughout europe some areas could really be describes as being ravaged by witch hunts in others it was isolated cases in some ares there were none the holy roman empire or more precisely some of the constituent parts of the holy roman empire experienced extensive witch hunts theres also a lot of cases in the neighbouring areas of switzerland and france many areas in southern europe had much fewer cases scandinavia did have witch hunts but not on the same level and interestingly with a lot more men accused than women britain had some prominent examples but again not on the same scale as the hre theres also famously cases outside europe especially salem of course as to the death toll being comparatively low that does of course depend on what you compare it to the black death or the thrity years war certainly claimed a lot more lives and were talking orders of magnitude here and that is true for a lot of medieval and early modern military conflicts the crusades the hundred years war the english civil war all had a higher death toll that being said this is a comparison between major military campaigns and people essentially burning their next door neighbours out of paranoid fear at this point were asking whether killing <number> people for a completely imagined crime or killing millions in a horrendous military campaign is worse also many of these other catastrophes were part of the background of insecurity and fear that was an important contributor to the witch craze youre right that the role of the church or churches in this is somewhat complicated the rather common depiction in pop cukture of the inquisition burning witches at the stake is indeed not accurate to say the least on the other hand there is clearly an important religious component for example there is hardly any witch hunts in orthodox country and none in muslim controlled areas and this includes christian territories under ottoman rule the official position of the catholic church for most of the middle ages was that there was in fact no such thing as witchcraft as far as i understand it basically because this would imply supernatural power from a source other than god meaning that belief in witchcraft was against church doctrine so you couldnt really accuse someone of witchcraft because that would essentailly mean you held the heretical belief that witchcraft was real and if you really practiced something you believed to be witchcraft your crime was that belief not your magical practices on the other hand the idea of a pact with the devil was already present in augustines writings and was picked up by thomas aquinas so some of the essentail framework for later witch hunts was already present the main task of the inquisition was always rooting out heresy as such they were not terribly interested in witches and might actually not even believe in their existence this actually means that in countriesareas where the inquisition had a lot of influence like for example spain there were very few witchcraft trials on the other hand the author of the malleus maleficarum was an inquisitor albeit one in constant conflict with church authorities so the inquisition was obviously not immune to the ideas which led to the witch craze but it was not a major proponent of those ideas in fact a lot of the trials were not even held in church courts but in secular courts which also means that the willingness of secular authorities to prosecute people for alleged witchcraft was an important factor in determining where witch hunts did or did not happen what makes it obvious at once that witch hunts were not tied to the inquisition in any way is the fact that a lot of witch hunts took place in protestant territories luther calling for the prosecution of witches from the pulpit obviously didnt help there nor did james vi and is fear of witches later on as to further reading back when i did this stuff at uni a good <number> years ago i seem to remember that wolfgang behringers work was rather highly regarded just tried to google whether that is still the case but apparently he has written a very controversial book about the history of climate in the meantime with some rather stupid claims from what i can gather which doesnt say anything about the validiy of his work on witchcraft but pretty makes googling him rather complicated if you want to read up about witchcraft accusations before the major witch hunts mainly as a tool against politically powerful women gemma hollmanns royal witches is a good read richard kieckhefers magic in the middle ages is also useful for a lot of the background story i havent gotten around to reading marion gibsons witchcraft a history in thirteen trials yet but it certainly seems wirth a read as well,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUtV3FZV2Y5TUhfOS05RmNaekRUNFVRdDFZUlNPTVZWTkx3c2RDS3EtMHp2b2ZQdktmejBubkY3aGZnYUxfY3E3V2xLSHFfd25rb3RtN2dJQndBQUh6eFE9PQ==

a lot of why didnt technology take off in the americas questions have the same answer it did but locally that applies to agriculture writing early pottery domesticated animals and indeed to metalworking regional civilizations independently invented and developed the technology but it didnt spread or at least not fast enough we know that civilizations in the northern andes had metalworking three thousand years ago and they continued developing the technology throughout the centuries hammering mining smelting quite sophisticated techniques but it took over two millennia for that knowledge to spread to central america when it did the mesoamericans really went hog wild with it metalworking became an important part of mesoamerican societies within a few centuries and by the time the spanish arrived some mesoamericans had already tentatively started using metal tools and weapons similarly people in the great lakes regions had been making copper tools for up to seven thousand years and theres some evidence of people in the pacific northwest making iron tools but the iron tools never spread and the use of copper only spread south to the mississippian region very slowly and never reached mesoamerica and thats a huge difference with the old world the first large scale metalworking in west asia and the balkans happened some seven thousand years ago not that much earlier than in north america but instead of staying local to the region it spreads rapidly the rest of europe uses it within centuries egypt within a millenium india within two millenia so almost immediately you have this broad interwoven network of civilizations exchanging on ideas techniques raw materials and that really helps improve metalworking like britain was famous for its tin deposits its not hard to imagine british civilization independently inventing a use for tin but then what what can you do with just tin not much but instead britain was part of a continental network exchanging goods and ideas and that british tin was used to make bronze all the way in asia and that is the main thing the americas lacked if andean ideas on mining and smelting gold had made its way to mesoamerica in centuries instead of millennia and if great lakes copper tools had made its way to mesoamerica as well and if the combination of the two ideas had made its way back to the andes and the great lakes and back and forth and back and forth then things would have started rolling instead every american civilization needed to invent the techniques independently and only with the materials they had available locally and because of that its use never left the niche it was originally invented for,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHZm56S01nY3RJekhiT1lhMllRYW56TGpMQi1uMmhRR29NNVhXX1NFbkwyS2E1YnV0bzVhTmJJVlNJbnpEbEdiYnQ4Rm5hY3BzM0hDN242Z3hUZ2ljRWc9PQ==

according to hesiod the macedonians would not be considered greek but luckily for you and me we dont have to rely on hesiod to determine whether or not macedonians were greek to be fair no one considered themselves to be greek during that time period there was no concept of a unified people called greece there were athenians spartans thebans etc macedonians lived in greece they spoke a greek dialect they worshipped greek gods they had identical architecture to greece >modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the macedonians place within the greek world considering material remains of greekstyle monuments buildings inscriptions dating from the th century and the predominance of greek personal names one school of thought says that the macedonians were truly greeks who had retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern greece this cultural discrepancy was used during the political struggles in athens and macedonia in the th century see here<url>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZSZlB1MlljYldkZkM2RkhfZlUwbU1Ma0RPTjh0SkplYmJ1TXpXTElNRXZ4aUZhQmJPQWMwRnNSN01KUDZWdHJNZDAtc3JXZTBuOWJBWVkwc19OSVhHQWc9PQ==

after reading the article the first thing that struck my amateur mind was that this altar stone could have been a gift or symbolic gesture from the orkneys i could imagine an important part of a henge there being gifted either as tribute or as a donation to the builders of stonehenge or alternatively that connections between the builders on the orkneys and those of stonehenge might have influenced the latter to source a slab of sandstone from there,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTYTJsYXBOZTlPT21mWkIxTWRscXV3dkdJTmJXV3NRVXB0bW1QcnZ1aFRyeFBWWWxhUnZzR2lVa3pxWHlEd0MxSEcxOGNYa0Y5ODBkWkNrcVhITjFyR0E9PQ==

>that was written by demosthenes himself that was recorded by demosthenes he recorded phillips letters and its largely considered authentic he was calling upon them to resist him the fact that he was so strongly antiphillip and still included the bit in there where phillip mentioned his hellenic status is a pretty big clue that it was from phillip and not demosthenes demosthenes got shat on by some of his own contemporaries for his bias against phillip and really it was more of phillip that he hated not so much the macedonians demosthenes was an athenian and a greek phillip was a macedonian and a greek his mother was lynkestae and a macedonian and a greek that greek bit did not matter too much to people during their lives outside of a general recognition of shared language customs religion they were not united they were not buddies they were not a state the macedonians worshipping the same gods speaking the same language albeit a dialect which every single other citystate also spoke a variant of there is not one ancient greek and generally following the same culture as others made them greek they definitely had their own uniquenesses but again so did every group we consider greek the spartans were constantly ridiculed mocked and had serious accusations thrown their way by athenians for their terrible cultural differences but no one consideres for a second that they werent greek they just had their own flavour of greekness the greek label does not mean as much in antiquity as it does today beyond othering but othering existed within the hellenic states as well the issue of some not seeing macedon as greek is part of this othering basically they saw them as rednecks hill folk not as cultured as the athenians but again these sorts of accusations are thrown against a lot of other citystates as well a final point to draw attention and clarity to this process would be to look towards how greeks viewed barbarians you have terms that mean to talk like a barbarian or to be like a mede persian in this case but you also have these same sorts of insults geared towards those who dressed like or were kind to or enjoyed spartan culture it was an insult because they were so different these insults naturally became more prevalent around the time of the peloponnesian war we see something similar happening around that time where amazons were shown dressed like spartan women not to completement them but to show them as barbaric and backwards demosthenes is writing to turn the people against phillip hes writing in a time where he sees macedon as becoming hegemon and wants athenians to wake up his comments are more propaganda than anything but its what the greeks did,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTbnVpSTdjYmU4SmhsekJLQ2tBOHpGdkhvQWxPN0NFdnVpTTdJR05MSXE4N1lrUUM3M2FEYmhhRTZmdzdUdHhpbjR1Y09HaGxfNW54ald6NG1FQWhCbWc9PQ==

there is no right history as long as your argument is supported by the evidence in fact the majority of historians dont research war or the military there may be aspects that you have to keep in mind but thats something you have to do in every field my speciality is war adjacent but i dont walk much about war itself i talk about how people interacted with each other in the scope of the military and society viewed various members within that so i have to acknowledge that war exists but it generally isnt my area of interest i also have to be aware of religion as it pops up but im not writing about religion if you open an italian restaurant you dont have to serve canollis but you want to be aware of them and able to discuss the basics so if youre interested in humanitarian history thats absolutely an area you can expand into but humanitarian crises often go handinhand with warfare so you might be researching the humanitarian reaction to the somali civil war where you would be expected to know the basics around the war the various parties involved etc but only to show you understand what the stakes were when discussing the humanitarian responses if that makes sense just like i need to know why a soldier may make an offering to the gods even if i have zero interest in religion but if you take anything from what ive written id suggest you sit down with your advisor at school if theres a certain lecturerprofessor that has been getting you interested in humanitarian stuff id have a meeting with them too or if theres just one you feel comfortable with even if theyre a military historian we all know people across hundreds of different fields in history ive shared offices with historians that covered quilts scottish dress same sex love letters in ancient egypt crypts and burial customs etc and have been present in so many conference talks about historical topics i never even thought about childrens toys in archaeological finds is one thats been getting really popular lately,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTbmVfdUk3TWZRWjZST0F6R3VQQnFZMkJIY1pCbzBXMnpxY0tldUN5NVZsSzAyQ0dlMHMzU0ZvSHItVWVtQmsta0g4U0dyWmVVLUZ2a2V0QVM5VG50cWc9PQ==

the concept of europe as a distinct political ideahasexistedsince the romans the existence of an idea of geographic area as a unitary concept doesnt imply that there are no cultural differences all it means to say is that to some extent people historically considered that area to comprise a distinct and coherent sense of identity and that it makes sense to do things like talk about indian history before <number> or talk about italian history before <number>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZaTW16UlJXSEdlM2dHM2pVcFpUb080UWRTeG1FNThIV1c0QnZlSV95VUpZT3V0NjJEN2N2cnpvYWRDSlhZR3AxeU1vcFBiT3BDa2VQODl6Yy1tZVZQdEE9PQ==

tell that to the germans and slavs who account for the majority of european population and nations it makes sense to talk about it on a geographical level sure and obviously there will be cultural similarities in neighbouring nations that will make it convenient lazy to group them into a common theme roman europe was the only culture in europe same in china and india the reality is there was no coherent cultural union <number> years ago that covered modern india it could be atgued it doesnt really exist in modern india either and modern india is a cultural construct of the colonial times if you look at the ongoing civil wars and the cultural and religious divides in the country it is easy to see th differences aa you travel east to west and north to south india is a beautiful and diverse country of multiple cultures with an equally diverse history to lump it all together as a single cultural union for <number> years is frankly condescending and insulting to the people of modern india and their history just as it would be to the slavic peoples of europe to say they were european because of rome,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZaQWdzLTU4MGsyZXBINFgzeUUzeFk4Z1ZTSkdVQ21tNktDb25LUTVsNENrcmVxeXRJZEp0ZGNsVURENFU0NnNKSG9SR201VEF3bGl0V25iSlZITnZ4X1E9PQ==
you are straw manning my point i didnt say that there was only one culture in europe or only one culture in india i said that historically people in both of those areas would have roughly understood what you meant if you talked about europe as a whole or india as a whole the idea of india purely being a british construction which it wasnt even modern indian nationalism was largely created by native indians in response to british colonialism is a myth popular on this uneducated website only the current state of india has carried over some its institutions from the british colonial government any basic history course will teach the difference between a nation or cultural concept and a state the existence of those ideas bears no implication on the reality of the cultural divisions that existed in those places only that there were broader cultural similarities that people could understand and that makes it coherent to talk about those areas as distinct units when the context calls for it and please spare me with the pearlclutching over offense,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZaVGV1THFmOXdXMTBQbjlnVkQ2TTJiSEp0LWNuLUdKcm1wZ1VQU2FGTVMxRHRJQ0Q5bF93V3ZHenc4dG4wek4zekVkYUt6SnpLUm5yUUVpd3o0WHZuWUE9PQ==

hi as we hope you can appreciate the holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with while we dont want to curtail discussion we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit outright holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head as such the rhistory mods have created this brief overview it is not intended to stifle further discussion but simply lay out the basic incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way what was the holocaust the holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of <number><number> million european jews carried out systematically by nazi germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during world war ii some historians will also include the deaths of the roma communists mentally disabled and other groups targeted by nazi policies which brings the total number of deaths to <number><number> million debates about whether or not the holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred but this guy says otherwise unfortunately there is a small but vocal minority of persons who fall into the category of holocaust denial attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude impugn well proven facts or even claim that the holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened although they often selfstyle themselves as revisionists they are not correctly described by the title while revisionism is not inherently a dirty word actual revision to quote michael shermer entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events rarely complete denial of the events themselves and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the holocaust it is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in <number> or so you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject and that is the result of good revisionism but these changes which even can be quite large such as the reassessment of deaths at auschwitz from ~<number> million to ~<number> million are done within the bounds of respected academic study and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections there are still plenty of questions within holocaust studies that are debated by scholars and there may still be more out there for us to discover and revise but when it comes to the basic facts there is simply no valid argument against them so what are the basics beginning with their rise to power in the s the nazi party headed by adolf hitler implemented a series of antijewish policies within germany marginalizing jews within society more and more stripping them of their wealth livelihoods and their dignity with the invasion of poland in <number> the number of jews under nazi control reached into the millions and this number would again increase with the invasion of the soviet union in <number> shortly after the invasion of poland the germans started to confine the jewish population into squalid ghettos after several plans on how to rid europe of the jews that all proved unfeasible by the time of the invasion of the soviet union in <number> ideological antisemitism and pragmatic resources considerations lead to masskillings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the nazi leadership first only practiced in the ussr it was influential groups such as the ss and the administration of the general government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of europe and sometime at the end of <number> met with hitlers approval the early killings were carried out foremost by the einsatzgruppen paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the ss and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of jews communists and other undesirable elements in the wake of the german militarys advance in what is often termed the holocaust by bullet the einsatzgruppen with the assistance of the wehrmacht the sd the security police as well as local collaborators would kill roughly two million persons over half of them jews most killings were carried out with mass shootings but other methods such as gas vans intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day were utilized too by early <number> the final solution to the socalled jewish question was essentially finalized at the wannsee conference under the direction of reinhard heydrich where the plan to eliminate the jewish population of europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied poland was presented and met with approval construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall and mass extermination mostly as part of operation reinhard had began operation by spring of <number> roughly <number> million persons nearly all jewish men women and children were immediately gassed upon arrival at bezec sobibor and treblinka over the next two years when these reinhard camps were closed and razed more victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as chemno but most infamously at auschwitzbirkenau where slightly over <number> million persons mostly jews died under the plan set forth at wannsee exterminations were hardly limited to the jews of poland but rather jews from all over europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter although the victims of the reinhard camps were originally buried they would later be exhumed and cremated and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as auschwitz the camps there were two main types of camps run by nazi germany which is sometimes a source of confusion concentration camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the nazis shortly after taking power beginning with the construction of dachau in <number> political opponents of all type not just jews could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the prewar years and while conditions were often brutal and squalid and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly although concentration camps were later made part of the final solution their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers some were way stations and others were work camps where germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as extermination through labor jews and other undesirable elements if deemed healthy enough to work could find themselves spared for a time and allowed to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end although some concentration camps such as mauthausen did include small gas chambers mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp many camps becoming extremely overcrowded nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus or starvation all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent bergenbelsen which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count saw some <number> deaths caused by the conditions often located in the reich camps liberated by the western forces were exclusively concentration camps and many survivor testimonies come from these camps the concentration camps are contrasted with the extermination camps which were purpose built for mass killing with large gas chambers and later on crematoria but little or no facilities for inmates often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits such as at bezec where only seven jews forced to assist in operation of the camp were alive after the war several camps however were hybrids of both types the most famous being auschwitz which was vast a complex of subcamps the infamous selection of prisoners conducted by ss doctors upon arrival meant life or death with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve the death count at auschwitz numbered around <number> million but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies how do we know running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here but suffice to say there is a lot of evidence and not just the mountains of survivor testimony we have testimonies and writings from many who participated as well german documentation of the programs this site<url> catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass

while india wasnt a single political entity it was a little more complicated that kingdoms at war with each other youre not wrong at a basic level that the subcontinent was several kingdoms jostling for regional and trans regional power the video is right about this as well but there was a broader political and sovereign framework that they operated within that had been deeply structured by the mughals there was a shared sense of an entity within which they all existed and one of the best gauges of this is how different kingdoms recognized the nominal sovereignty of the mughals as a means to exercise legitimacy hyderabad awadh bengal the jaipur kingdom all continued to seek nominal status within the mughal state even though the mughal emperors actual political power was significantly constrained mysore would similarly try to seek mughal recognition and when it failed due to the objections of hyderabad they declared themselves sultans but that lack of legitimacy also undermined their ability to hold power and their conflict with the british eventually toppled them the british were able to displace tipu sultan far more easily than many other royal families the marathas are the slightly odd element in this and in part because maratha history has become deeply enmeshed with nationalistic and sectarian memories so the modern vision is of the marathas as hindu rulers looking to overthrow the alien muslim mughal empire almost all of it a th century framing while the marathas did claim imperial status under the chattrapatis their grand imperial claims only really lasted a few years under shivaji and his son after the death of sambhaji power shifted to the peshwai and the maratha clans and these people were perfectly happy to recognize both the chattrapati a title that was incidentally contested between two families at satara and kolhapur due to a disputed succession and the mughals famously for instance in the late th century mahadji shinde was actually one of the strongest supporters of the mughal emperor shah alam and held the position of grand vizier the east india company operated in the same way too the eic had formally sought broad recognition from the mughal empire so that they could operate in the subcontinent it was crucial to gain legitimacy and acceptance in the eyes of indian elites whose collaboration they needed after <number> they received formal status as the diwans of bengal which was still nominally a subordinate to the mughal empire they would pay their national tribute and engage in the rituals of subordination throughout the th century things only really shifted after <number> as parliament forced the company to assert british sovereignty and more imperialist minded governors such as wellesley at the turn of the century pushed the company onto a trajectory of aggressive growth by conquest that the companys directors didnt really want the company slowly and surreptitiously began to drop their references to mughal sovereignty though it did have a destabilizing effect for them this tension over the sovereignty of the empire was one of the major strains of conflict in the great uprising of <number> and while the event was largely recast by the british as indians rebelling against them historians in the th century have pointed out that while that was defacto true in a dejure sense the british were technically the rebels against mughal suzerainty another fun fact the british refusing to pay what was owed to the emperor created a legal dispute that akbar shah actually won as a technical matter he had dispatched raja rammohan roy to england to argue his case and parliament was infact forced to acknowledge that the emperors case was valid and ordered the company to pay the emperor what he was owed they just chose to not really enforce the order and roy died soon after in london and so couldnt press the matter especially with parliament soon ending the companys commercial interests in <number> the point of all of this is to really say that there was infact this thing that the british called the empire of india which everyone sort of operated in its not quite a country but it was a sort of shared political sandbox and gaining formal legitimacy within that imperial frame was important even if the emperors power was purely symbolic but symbolic power can still be important in the study of history and politics even after <number> the british couldnt really escape that imperial construct and ended up recreating it by making victoria its empress and the need to respect the systems and demands of that imperial system and needing to operate as a subordinate within it even if only in a symbolic capacity has had a pretty profound impact on the underlying legal structures that would shape south asian law and the unified political entity that was british

the british did formally rule over most of the subcontinent by <number> but the complex system of sovereign authority and symbolism was deeply embedded into the structures of power and in shaking that system the british contributed to the rising of <number> and the way it played out before i explain further i think its important to clarify something major here which is this idea that indians understood the british were here to stay that comment and the underlying assumption of indians seeing themselves as insiders and the british as outsiders is grounded in a vision of united indians and foreign british that was in many ways a construct of the late th and early th century having forged a united country the british were left with the consequence of people actually starting to believe in the joint identity the national movement of the th century played a major role in deepening this dichotomy too but for the most part that sense of a singular national identity didnt exist in the th and early th century people saw the british as simply one more force in their world not necessarily as inherent outsiders but coming back to symbolism the system of claims that british power was built on allowed them to keep indian elites conciliated vast portions of india were under british authority but its worth remembering that the number of britons in india was always small for the raj to work the british needed the local aristocracy and upper caste communities to also accept their rule the vast majority of their army consisted of indian troops most of whom were recruited from upper caste and upper class muslim and hindu peasant communities communities that needed to be reassured that the british were legitimate rulers as any ruler needed to reassure them the other factor in this are the native princes and the local aristocrats essentially groups such as the various talukhdars and zamindars throughout india these groups similarly had to be constantly conciliated and the way the british did this was by notionally demonstrating their enmeshment into the lines of symbolic power rather than imposing themselves as conquerors by <number> this was in crisis the british had been busy alienating both their sepoys and the native princes through controversies over pay policies such as the doctrine of lapse and the anglicization of government the growing feeling among the landed elite was this sense that the british no longer adhered to the ancient customs by which they had lived remember this sort of thinking was not just about feeling hurt over sentiment the idea of customary practice was one that had legal force in many ways british actions were akin to a modern government trampling long held constitutional rights a deeply antagonistic thing for people we see controversies in <number> emerge out of these feelings such as the widespread rumor that the british were going to make muslim and hindu soldiers lose caste by having them bite the enfield bullet cartridges supposedly made of pork and beef these rumors grew out of this sense of alienation when the great revolt broke out sepoys and aristocrats converged on the traditional symbolic powers of the subcontinent bahadur shah zafar in delhi nana saheb the legal peshaw in kanpur the various clan princes such as in gwalior the seat of the shinde clan though the shinde royals ultimately sided with the british having to run from their own troops who were acclaiming them even lakshmibais battles are a manifestation of this all of these groups had been demanding a restoration of their traditional rights and privileges which the british had been undermining as they asserted their own sovereignty over the more traditional lines of power the british would claim these acts rebellious british historiography would write of bahadur shahs proclamation as emperor but nobody was proclaiming him emperor he was already emperor it wasnt until the s that people started going well technically the british were the rebels you know the fact that the eic was defacto in charge of the country doesnt take away from the fact that these equations and claims of symbolic power were important even though the uprising was quelled the british realized they had gone too far in uprooting traditional systems of power post <number> there was a concentrated restoration of native authority the autonomy of native princes such as the nizam of hyderabad and the rajas of gwalior actually increased somewhat the british also eventually realized theyd need to do more hence why the british began investing heavily in trying to promote a veneration of the monarchy indian princes were inculcated into british symbolic recognition through the star of india and later the order of the british empire victoria was proclaimed empress the british would hold grand durbars evoking the old forms of mughal power invest in magnificent architectural projects see the high court buildings the viceregal palaces later things such as victoria memorial and finally new delhi building grand structures was a particularly traditional way of establishing legitimacy in india going back to the establishment of great temples grand mosques and lavish tombs such as the taj mahal the jama masjids in various cities or the great temples in the south you can even see the eventual relocation of the capital to delhi as a manifestation of this policy of keeping the indian elite conciliated and the consequences of these systems of legitimacy sovereignty and conciliation have shaped indian laws and ideas of politics at a deeply fundamental level even

so the history of landlords in pakistan is a tad complicated <number> certainly played a small role in the reorganization of holdings there but both sindh and punjab had been relatively recently conquered when the great revolt happened as a result because the region was under much heavier military occupation the uprising wasnt particularly widespread there it is where the myth of a loyal punjab came from sindh similarly didnt see too much pressure what that meant was that landlords werent actively displaced in the same numbers as they were in places such as modern day up and bihar in india but many land holders in pakistan nonetheless gained their domains later in the th century the british played a major role in redistributing land there for instance with the canal colonies in punjab saw significant land tenure expansions and entire communities being established further because the british liked to recruit from peasant communities and because punjab and to an extent sindh became favored recruiting grounds for the army after <number> till about <number> there was also a lot of enmeshment between the major landholders and the military this meant that the british were somewhat invested in making sure communities that they favored as martial races had access to territory so that there was adequate recruitment for the military youll notice i havent spoken much about the nwfp and balochistan and thats because im just not as familiar with those regions they were brought under british rule even later than sindh and punjab for the most part and its outside my area of expertise so i dont want to offer comments on what was going on there vis landlords in relation to the midth century upheavals,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZicGdRNUhDWmVjZXA5YkxVYnYyaElmR0ttR2V4eHFyOTl4S09OTURObE5qWWdPNkJkWFNkd21EaGRVWnBqVFhzUnVQNmc4MmF3UW4zRjE0LUwtQ1VfVHlxU1hTWkg1dFAzWllGWEdEWnJRXzA9

hawke is perhaps most famous for colliding with titanics twin sister olympic in september <number> the two ships were on parallel tracks in the solent when the hawke suddenly turned towards olympic hawke was unable to stop and her armoured bow crashed into the side of olympic causing serious damage to the liner but no injuries hawke suffered major damage with her bow crushed and could have been lost but she was able to make it to port olympic returned to southampton to offload passengers and make emergency repairs but she had to return to her makers at harland and wolff in belfast for drydocking and the replacement of a propellor shaft crews who were busy completing her sister ship were diverted to fixing olympic which meant there were delays to the completion of titanic six weeks of repairs created massive costs for white star who were already spending heavily on the three new super liners and had to find replacement vessels to fill their service ironically the fact olympic survived the collision and flooding of two of her compartments only increased public perceptions that these giant new ships were entirely safe the royal navy blamed olympic for the accident which was held up by the court of inquiry blaming the enormous displacement of water around the liner for drawing in the much smaller warship the case eventually went all the way to the house of lords who ruled against white star though i cant see what punishment the company received anyone,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZiOUZmT2NZVG9jYTRqSWh6ZFd1Z1Btb1hnT3lQNHNNd3lCVzFzZml3Y2JuSW9XRjNVdkRSWWZMZTRrZnZQZmxKQWEtM1d1b1ZZUTI2Zk5PajZheXlZR0E9PQ==

india in <number> had a larger gdp than all of europe combined measuring historical gdp is notoriously tricky but this is almost certainly false using the figures i can find it seems like it was only slightly larger than western europe so including eastern and southeastern europe indias economy would have been smaller i have a hunch that whoever came up with this fact just ignored the ottoman and russian empires because theyre mostly asian powers even though they had large holdings in europe at that time by <number> indias share had dropped to <number> and its people were left impoverished very cleverly worded to make you think that indias economy had gone down in the intervening years in fact indias gdp overall rose significantly during that period the percentage of world gdp dropped because europe and north america saw an explosion in population and production its like saying americas share of world gdp has dropped since the s because china has been looting the american economy with unfair trade deals chinas trade policies aside the american economy hasnt gone down its just that formerly impoverished countries like china korea and even india to an extent have seen a massive increase in wealth during this period of disorder the british sensed opportunity the british couldnt have cared less about conquering india during the mid th century much like the conquistadors the men who set up britains early territorial gains in india werent operating under orders from home and sometimes completely in the face of them robert clive didnt have the full support of his superiors in the east india company never mind the government in london armies are expensive and the profitminded company men always grumbled about the cost its really ridiculous once you know a bit about the history of the british raj just how close it came to never happening because all they really wanted to do was buy tea then once clive had secured bengal and they realized there was something there worth defending the government in london started to take an interest but even then most of the wars were reactive trying to defend what theyd already taken from ambitious indian princes and the french especially the french who were a lot more interested in playing the game and somehow a lot worse at it indias native institutions were demolished almost half of the raj was made up of autonomous states governed by native princes the british dictated their external affairs but otherwise they could rule themselves although many leaned heavily on the british for support and ironically the video uses a picture of a temple to illustrate the point when indias hindu temples flourished during the raj in fact indias native institutions were far more stable during british rule than they had been under the mughals due to both the disorder of the final decades of mughal power and the very antihindu policies of many emperors and thats just the first minute and a half im not going to go through the whole video,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZiNUh6YUx4cGJYM3ZBamVnNEx6M3lIUXFXd1VxN3g4bVhwenNacnFpclB2X3hvOU9QZ19oVnJBOEJMdlpFNmFPSWQ3VUhjNUVueXpMWUFCdW9DdnNHVFE9PQ==

hi as we hope you can appreciate the holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with while we dont want to curtail discussion we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit outright holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head as such the rhistory mods have created this brief overview it is not intended to stifle further discussion but simply lay out the basic incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way what was the holocaust the holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of <number><number> million european jews carried out systematically by nazi germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during world war ii some historians will also include the deaths of the roma communists mentally disabled and other groups targeted by nazi policies which brings the total number of deaths to <number><number> million debates about whether or not the holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred but this guy says otherwise unfortunately there is a small but vocal minority of persons who fall into the category of holocaust denial attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude impugn well proven facts or even claim that the holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened although they often selfstyle themselves as revisionists they are not correctly described by the title while revisionism is not inherently a dirty word actual revision to quote michael shermer entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events rarely complete denial of the events themselves and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the holocaust it is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in <number> or so you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject and that is the result of good revisionism but these changes which even can be quite large such as the reassessment of deaths at auschwitz from ~<number> million to ~<number> million are done within the bounds of respected academic study and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections there are still plenty of questions within holocaust studies that are debated by scholars and there may still be more out there for us to discover and revise but when it comes to the basic facts there is simply no valid argument against them so what are the basics beginning with their rise to power in the s the nazi party headed by adolf hitler implemented a series of antijewish policies within germany marginalizing jews within society more and more stripping them of their wealth livelihoods and their dignity with the invasion of poland in <number> the number of jews under nazi control reached into the millions and this number would again increase with the invasion of the soviet union in <number> shortly after the invasion of poland the germans started to confine the jewish population into squalid ghettos after several plans on how to rid europe of the jews that all proved unfeasible by the time of the invasion of the soviet union in <number> ideological antisemitism and pragmatic resources considerations lead to masskillings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the nazi leadership first only practiced in the ussr it was influential groups such as the ss and the administration of the general government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of europe and sometime at the end of <number> met with hitlers approval the early killings were carried out foremost by the einsatzgruppen paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the ss and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of jews communists and other undesirable elements in the wake of the german militarys advance in what is often termed the holocaust by bullet the einsatzgruppen with the assistance of the wehrmacht the sd the security police as well as local collaborators would kill roughly two million persons over half of them jews most killings were carried out with mass shootings but other methods such as gas vans intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day were utilized too by early <number> the final solution to the socalled jewish question was essentially finalized at the wannsee conference under the direction of reinhard heydrich where the plan to eliminate the jewish population of europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied poland was presented and met with approval construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall and mass extermination mostly as part of operation reinhard had began operation by spring of <number> roughly <number> million persons nearly all jewish men women and children were immediately gassed upon arrival at bezec sobibor and treblinka over the next two years when these reinhard camps were closed and razed more victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as chemno but most infamously at auschwitzbirkenau where slightly over <number> million persons mostly jews died under the plan set forth at wannsee exterminations were hardly limited to the jews of poland but rather jews from all over europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter although the victims of the reinhard camps were originally buried they would later be exhumed and cremated and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as auschwitz the camps there were two main types of camps run by nazi germany which is sometimes a source of confusion concentration camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the nazis shortly after taking power beginning with the construction of dachau in <number> political opponents of all type not just jews could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the prewar years and while conditions were often brutal and squalid and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly although concentration camps were later made part of the final solution their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers some were way stations and others were work camps where germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as extermination through labor jews and other undesirable elements if deemed healthy enough to work could find themselves spared for a time and allowed to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end although some concentration camps such as mauthausen did include small gas chambers mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp many camps becoming extremely overcrowded nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus or starvation all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent bergenbelsen which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count saw some <number> deaths caused by the conditions often located in the reich camps liberated by the western forces were exclusively concentration camps and many survivor testimonies come from these camps the concentration camps are contrasted with the extermination camps which were purpose built for mass killing with large gas chambers and later on crematoria but little or no facilities for inmates often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits such as at bezec where only seven jews forced to assist in operation of the camp were alive after the war several camps however were hybrids of both types the most famous being auschwitz which was vast a complex of subcamps the infamous selection of prisoners conducted by ss doctors upon arrival meant life or death with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve the death count at auschwitz numbered around <number> million but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies how do we know running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here but suffice to say there is a lot of evidence and not just the mountains of survivor testimony we have testimonies and writings from many who participated as well german documentation of the programs this site<url> catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass

the guy who came up with stockholm syndrome is nils bejerot hes also very infamous for being the father of swedish drug policies he envisioned drug addiction as a disease people take drugs and become diseased with addiction then they spread the addiction to people around them and it keeps going until it spreads throughout the country the thing with his approach is therefore that the fault of drug use spreading and drug addiction is not dealers but users drug users are at fault for drug addiction becoming a societal problem and they must be quarantined this is done by prosecuting them and eventually incarceratinginstitutionalising them by cutting off drug users from society he figured drug use would stop spreading his reasoning was that people dont naturally know that you can inject substances to get high someone must have first told them and taught how to do it among western countries sweden is unique because sweden incriminates drug use while most other countries only do possession you can be prosecuted here for failing a drug test as a result swedish police spend a lot of time chasing drug users and making people do drug tests bejerot is pretty influential while also being relatively unknown today,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0eGNtd0VmZjQ5SFRoaWZOVDIyRDVtNVdnR2VPVUx0T3VrWlptYUU1R3VwR3dJQ0paZmFSNGdMd1hjMmN2aWJ1SjhXYUlRakVUbFFId2c4aFc0d2poQVE9PQ==

from the article for some this theorising was an attempt to deflect attention away from the mistakes made by him and police colleagues during the siege by instead putting the blame on victims over the course of the siege the four hostages and two criminals began to develop an unlikely bond inside the bank vault amid apparent acts of kindness by the captors in contrast the captives expressed more hostility towards the police fearing that any attempt to end the standoff might end in them being killed ive always thought this psycho analysis was contrived the police wanted to go in and shoot the criminals and based on the phone calls the hostages overheard they felt like they would die in the crossfire and that the police didnt value their lives as much as they valued stopping the robbery the police were being nitwits and the hostages were trying to stay alive while the police force made it clear that wasnt their main priority i feel for the hostages here just trying to stay alive and then the police creating some psychology buzz term to get public support for whoops maybe we killed a hostage but they turned into criminals themselves so its ok,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0UkZoa3lmTmd2aWk3WUxzU1hiUWRmVWNaR3ludFhiWURyYTJFRHk5aU1qMTBtdnRyVDhTTFoyTUMtVWIyUGdMTU5RaHJ1OEdpemNicWNlYjhlNjdLSUE9PQ==

the english civil war and the fronde i am curious about these two events they happened roughly in the same time span yet they had drastically different results the english civil war resulted in a military dictatorship followed by the reestablishment of the monarchy but ultimately strengthened parliament and set the stage for modern british politics the fronde on the other hand simply confirmed the divine rights of kings in france is it fair to compare these two events as though they are mirrored of each other why were the results so different how much would have had to change to cause the results of one event to be more like the other,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2bmk3bmhMMHpBX1g3eTdFZ2JNY1V2ZU5TRkZFUkNueXFGalYyamNXSzhFMGp0c1paSWtFQWRadlJ5THdNU054TDBjeFZZdUEyXzM2VjBMaGxpZURqNXc9PQ==

its not a given that genetics and culture are tied iirc we see this most in europe or india with migrations of peoples that imposed a new elite on static populations but not at enough numbers to displace the genetic preponderance of the now subjugated people it gave english a nice smattering of french loan wordscows are still cows but if you kill it it becomes beefbeouf but didnt make the anglosaxon population norman or for that case normandy didnt become norse either these developments also are potential indicators of new or moving populations but if a future archeologist finds a pair of blue jeans under neo tokyo does that indicate japan became american post wwii,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2MXY3UWlHMktHRk1meE9lS0IyTXJxWXRRMmtESmpqaEtPR0ZFbXpoRW5qSlNJM3F6blZicU9wNnozV1BLVjBEMVdHdERrLUJsVUlnMldfYmRWME9ydlN6V1pPSXpnajdkRU1Bakt1N20zS3M9
its a bit difficult to give definitive answers here because the concept of slavery was much larger and more detailed than we think of in our modern presumably western minds there wasnt just one type of slave there wasnt just one type of slavery and multiple different types of both could exist within one part of greece and then we need to remember as well that these were mostly all independent places with their own laws customs etc additionally while some slaves could be owned by the state to use a term carefully they could also be privately owned what one owner does and and another does is often going to be different so slavery wasnt practiced the same way everywhere but for simplicities sake ill continue to use the term slave as a catchall there are depictions in the iconography which show slaves with beards but the problem with iconography is that it may not always reflect actual practices and sometimes we can only hypothesise that someone is a slave and unless theyve written something next to them to definitely say they are it can be difficult but youre right that hair was a very important cultural and social marker it was not only used to show positive things but also negative things women in particular were often marked for adultery or prostitution in this way so you would definitely see slaves having their hair shorn but it wouldnt have been every slave in every place,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2UVdSaHB0R0l0ZEFmTHdNMmlGaVV1Q25GZER3OGxPZUEySGVSb21kXzhSUWwtZkdORXhTODR6MmtpS0JOYnIzZGJGUXlybkN6TnFvVFhjb09NOXJWN0E9PQ==
folsom plano clovis etc are all culture designations its a way for archeologists and anthropologists to create broad groups for material evidence that we find many times we dont even have human bones at these sites its edged weapons animal bones or burnt seeds these cultures often overlapped and shared their technology so even these culture designations can be fluid and subjective we often dont know who occupied these sites they dont correspond to modern tribes for the few sites where there are human bones scientists are slowly sampling and sequencing where its possible this is complicated by indigenous peoples beliefs around their ancestors remains and american and canadian laws that protect those beliefsremains in the paper mentioned above the researchers were able to use previously sequenced dna from ancient native americans and compare it to <number> modern people from the blackfoot tribe they found that the blackfoot people have been in the area a very long time the tribe also seems to have been isolated for a long time as there was admixture they specifically mention the cree people but that admixture happened recently i assume most mixing happened after the trail of tears when several tribes were shoved together and marched west into the great plains i hope this helps,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2ekh3SHo2X2Q4Nmcxai1COTUzZDBDVWJlOFZzMlZhekEwODg1TFlfYmVRYXpmMU5IUFlOS255elc1ZDNINmlsZlllZkVMRXVnZWpHSzZOa1ZYeEpuTlE9PQ==

probably not humans have been around a long time and much has changed in that time to explain plenty of our myths if they are anything more than that gigantopithecus went extinct during the pleistocene some <number> years ago which may explain the oral traditions of large apes like bigfoot or yetis but even anthropologists r divided on that its somewhat unlikely that our oral histories would go back a million years much less the <number> million years and a dozen different species for anything to remain from our ancestoes in nakalipithecus or whatever contemporary ape is our actual ancestor but the fact that oral histories can go back tens of thousands is super cool and one that is not talked about enough oral histories are frequently no worse as sources than the plainly biased written records we have,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2S09fZjF3bUxnNWFWVWpxeXN6MzNvdUZqbkhPcTVORVFmcWlPY0RLQXEzVHJsblV3QlliX0xHODVTdEQzcEZNYTQ4TXVRWXloWllEWndvSmhRNnFiZlE9PQ==
i think it is fairly unlikely that we have oral history from before the development of language but there might be some instincutal norms baked into our myths somehow it is just hard to say that something like the fear of fire is a cultural thing that is passed down rather it seems to be learned behavior in most things that encounter it specific knowledge like that tends to be taught i just sort of doubt that chimps and apes both lost the ability to speak over time i think it is much more likely that our ancestors developed it after the split i know that is probably not what you were saying but without a continuous oral history most of what we could glean from ancestors would be things that we would learn almost immediately on our own without that language probably did arise sometime between <number> and <number> years ago though so that it a lot of time basic oral concepts might have been transfered some mythological ideas might be insanely old,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2dVFCSHpFWHBkOUdKaTlmUUM0UERCNnFXZ3lRbjVVdE44X1JCMFFIN1gtNHNkdjgxWGVVc0M0cC1JMmJLNlRfNE1vVnQ5MnBhbjVGM1BsekRsMW1Sanc9PQ==

those arent necessarily cultures in the same way the blackfeet are you say yourself that theyre characterized by specific technology but thats because its all we have to go on within that category there could be dozens of distinct cultures sharing the same for sources and hunting styles like how apache and comanche tribes both used horses and lived in similar areas more recently consider all the different cultures in the world today that share the same technology despite different languages customs etc theres no reason why the blackfeet couldnt have existed and overlapped with these other cultures by using the technology common of the time,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2WC00Vmg1YkZIMW05SzRKRWw4M01VNFFBYUdQWUZ1QlJSTHhZdk56aVRVMXlTbFR3b2xMZ1pOOG9lREVkeFY5YzdBR01XYU5IM19aZVNFWGpsUEtBa2pRY0FSSEczNlJaZ2JWb3I5c3ZPa2s9

the cerutti mastodon site is not very well liked among most archeologists and anthropologists because its incredibly circumstantial evidence with potential explanations that are much more recent ie road traffic damaging the bones theres nothing else apart from the prospect of the bones being smashed that points towards human presence theres nothing like a sign of human habitation like trash tools human bones or even the use of nearby stone that should be useful for making tools nothing else even close to this old has ever been found anywhere in the either continent and already the cerutti mastodon site is working off extremely ambiguous evidence at best its also worth mentioning that based on our current understanding of human genetics and the movement of anatomically modern humans even if this is shown at some point to have been some kind of human presence in america based on the site it almost certainly has absolutely no connection to modern native americans who came from asia in waves of migration much more recently its most likely its an entirely different species of human like the cerutti mastodon site is almost twice as old as what seems to be the agreed upon date of when modern humans just started to leave africa let alone crossed eurasia and then went down into north america nothing this old with strong connections to modern humans have ever been found outside of africa,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3NGNUN0FORmlkSW5CR1ozTk1OUlQtM0p5VWE4TWZLXzVUY01BcHpEUVNVWURTenN6OGp6M3RoVWhzYU5UamNPNUdtbHpxbU9vU2dXNEZCM0NzRTB4c3c9PQ==

theres a story about getting kicked out from a beautiful garden for some transgression and a large number of people that had to leave their green pastures when the lakes dried out the animals left and the greenery dissapeared after a few thousand years the descendants of those people might retell the story as being kicked out of paradise but yes it could easily come from a different desertification event the lands where the story seems to originate from sumeria so modern iraq used to look very different from what they look now so maybe it was about that there are drawings depicting all sorts of animals that can only be found in zoos in that region and it was significantly greener the ancestors of the sumerians migrated to europe to become the eefs maybe they did so when the area changed significantly from something closer to paradise the ones that stayed and built those cities probably had a good reason to write stories about the good old days before they had to migrate when their homes turned into a desert i just personally like the north african idea because if the australians have stories going back k years then how come we dont have any from the end of the african wet period,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3aXV4R3dsbUU4aW5BTTlsQVNpb19lMnBrMVoxMVFnb3R2Z3FMaVpDVmFXdXIzUE9HU2FmTkd5T0pIVVp4MXExZ2RoOXdzTFB0R3RiM05QTm1peHR6Z3c9PQ==

it has to do with the ancient sumerian legend of an exodus from a gardenparadise created by the gods that humans lost access to because a woman was tempted by enki there are too many similarities between it and adam and eve for it to be a coincidence so where did the ancient sumerians hear this story before they wrote it down well from their ancestors obviously who had occupied the area since the first human migration that succeeded around <number> years ago so ancient sumer would have been one of the first places settled by people migrating out of africa and their reason for leaving is most likely a changing local climate the mythology itself is just their attempt to explain a natural process they did not understand,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY4d0FxMERNUWJaTjFjZnVPZjJZdkJ2dlktcFN5aFA0NDdxTlc3a1VqdXNfNHdrZUN5VWpoQm9mNFZxelZ1QzZsb3RiWjBwaHlHaGRWT1JDVDRRb0JiMmc9PQ==

the oral histories passed down by the hadza people<url> in africa are mind boggling >one telling of hadzasoral historydivides their past into four epochs each inhabited by a different culture according to this tradition at the beginning of time the world was inhabited by hairy giants called theakakaanebeefirst ones orgeranebeeancient ones theakakaanebeedid not possess tools or fire they hunted game by running it down until it fell dead they ate meat raw they did not build houses but slept under trees as the hadza do today in the dry season in older versions of this story they did not use fire because it was physically impossible in the earths primeval state younger hadza who have been to school say that theakakaanebeedid not know how to use fire >in the second epoch the akakaanebee were succeeded by the xhaaxhaanebee inbetween ones who were equally gigantic but without hair fire could be made and used to cook meat but animals had grown more wary of humans and had to be chased and hunted by dogs the xhaaxhaanebee were the first people to use medicines and charms to protect themselves from enemies and initiated the epeme rite they lived in caves >the third epoch was inhabited by the people of hamakwanebee recent days who were smaller than their predecessors they invented bows and arrows cooked with containers and mastered the use of fire they also built huts like those of hadza today the people of hamakwanebee were the first of the hadza ancestors to have contact with nonforaging people with whom they traded for iron to make knives and arrowheads they also invented the gambling game lukuchuko >the fourth epoch continues today and is inhabited by the hamayishonebee those of today when discussing the hamayishonebee epoch people often mention specific names and places and can say approximately how many generations ago events occurred this is highly intriguing when you consider this critical piece of information >hadzaland is about <number> kilometres mi fromolduvai gorge an area sometimes called the cradle of mankind because of the number ofhomininfossils found there and <number> kilometres mi from the prehistoric site oflaetoli,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY5ajBXVGdqdjdGX1p4VFozQmwydE0yZGZGMkZxOVd6dTJyQjdGaE5qbWFNRFQ1UDdiM195d1FNaGhvUzd6dHhXcG5WOGxKaWRXRGxuMWF6VTBoVkhSZHc9PQ==
hi as we hope you can appreciate the holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with while we dont want to curtail discussion we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit outright holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head as such the rhistory mods have created this brief overview it is not intended to stifle further discussion but simply lay out the basic incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way what was the holocaust the holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of <number><number> million european jews carried out systematically by nazi germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during world war ii some historians will also include the deaths of the roma communists mentally disabled and other groups targeted by nazi policies which brings the total number of deaths to <number><number> million debates about whether or not the holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred but this guy says otherwise unfortunately there is a small but vocal minority of persons who fall into the category of holocaust denial attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude impugn well proven facts or even claim that the holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened although they often selfstyle themselves as revisionists they are not correctly described by the title while revisionism is not inherently a dirty word actual revision to quote michael shermer entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events rarely complete denial of the events themselves and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the holocaust it is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in <number> or so you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject and that is the result of good revisionism but these changes which even can be quite large such as the reassessment of deaths at auschwitz from ~<number> million to ~<number> million are done within the bounds of respected academic study and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections there are still plenty of questions within holocaust studies that are debated by scholars and there may still be more out there for us to discover and revise but when it comes to the basic facts there is simply no valid argument against them so what are the basics beginning with their rise to power in the s the nazi party headed by adolf hitler implemented a series of antijewish policies within germany marginalizing jews within society more and more stripping them of their wealth livelihoods and their dignity with the invasion of poland in <number> the number of jews under nazi control reached into the millions and this number would again increase with the invasion of the soviet union in <number> shortly after the invasion of poland the germans started to confine the jewish population into squalid ghettos after several plans on how to rid europe of the jews that all proved unfeasible by the time of the invasion of the soviet union in <number> ideological antisemitism and pragmatic resources considerations lead to masskillings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the nazi leadership first only practiced in the ussr it was influential groups such as the ss and the administration of the general government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of europe and sometime at the end of <number> met with hitlers approval the early killings were carried out foremost by the einsatzgruppen paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the ss and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of jews communists and other undesirable elements in the wake of the german militarys advance in what is often termed the holocaust by bullet the einsatzgruppen with the assistance of the wehrmacht the sd the security police as well as local collaborators would kill roughly two million persons over half of them jews most killings were carried out with mass shootings but other methods such as gas vans intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day were utilized too by early <number> the final solution to the socalled jewish question was essentially finalized at the wannsee conference under the direction of reinhard heydrich where the plan to eliminate the jewish population of europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied poland was presented and met with approval construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall and mass extermination mostly as part of operation reinhard had began operation by spring of <number> roughly <number> million persons nearly all jewish men women and children were immediately gassed upon arrival at bezec sobibor and treblinka over the next two years when these reinhard camps were closed and razed more victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as chemno but most infamously at auschwitzbirkenau where slightly over <number> million persons mostly jews died under the plan set forth at wannsee exterminations were hardly limited to the jews of poland but rather jews from all over europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter although the victims of the reinhard camps were originally buried they would later be exhumed and cremated and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as auschwitz the camps there were two main types of camps run by nazi germany which is sometimes a source of confusion concentration camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the nazis shortly after taking power beginning with the construction of dachau in <number> political opponents of all type not just jews could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the prewar years and while conditions were often brutal and squalid and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly although concentration camps were later made part of the final solution their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers some were way stations and others were work camps where germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as extermination through labor jews and other undesirable elements if deemed healthy enough to work could find themselves spared for a time and allowed to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end although some concentration camps such as mauthausen did include small gas chambers mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp many camps becoming extremely overcrowded nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus or starvation all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent bergenbelsen which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count saw some <number> deaths caused by the conditions often located in the reich camps liberated by the western forces were exclusively concentration camps and many survivor testimonies come from these camps the concentration camps are contrasted with the extermination camps which were purpose built for mass killing with large gas chambers and later on crematoria but little or no facilities for inmates often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits such as at bezec where only seven jews forced to assist in operation of the camp were alive after the war several camps however were hybrids of both types the most famous being auschwitz which was vast a complex of subcamps the infamous selection of prisoners conducted by ss doctors upon arrival meant life or death with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve the death count at auschwitz numbered around <number> million but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies how do we know running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here but suffice to say there is a lot of evidence and not just the mountains of survivor testimony we have testimonies and writings from many who participated as well german documentation of the programs this site<url> catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass

this makes no sense from the link in the time of slavery in colombia hair braiding was used to relay messages for example to signal that they wanted to escape women would braid a hairstyle called departes it had thick tight braids braided closely to the scalp and was tied into buns on the top asprilla garcia says and another style had curved braids tightly braided on their heads the curved braids would represent the roads they would use to escape asprilla garcia says in the braids they also kept gold and hid seeds which in the long run helped them survive after they escaped who are they signaling that they want to escape were there people hanging around waiting to help slaves escape who would notice their hair how does the braider know so much about how to escape yet they have not escaped themselves how helpful can a cornrow map possibly be as the link says there were communities of escaped slaves in remote areas why not just tell the person making the break where to go cornrows take hours to braid did columbian slaves really have that much free time how dumb were the owners that they didnt notice slaves getting a new hairstyle and then escaping shortly after where were the slaves getting gold to hide in their hair why would they need to smuggle seeds didnt they have bags if escaped slaves did this in the us how come none of them wrote about it after slavery was outlawed in the s the wpa interviewed dozens of former slaves and wrote up the slave narratives i have read dozens and none mentioned anything like this,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdGWTlJRnNLRmpfQnRFODcxLWJGOTdBREhPdHpWWnpDcmRBcy1sZXM0OVJUbFhadU9TSHhnaDE0SjdpNzUxSkFqVmVDWU9qSTE4SUlsdDdzcUVrTUI4NGc9PQ==

all of it sounds reasonable enough it just depends on how restricted they were and how they managed to circumvent those restrictions how limited was conversation how easy was it to organize groups if a few key forks of a route could be mapped out in a pattern thats a map available to any number of people at just a glance without speaking without a physical object that is obvious contraband same with seeds and bags also working with detainees and refugees lots of coping details get lost in the trauma the communication methods are passed down out of necessity to people that need to know in the moment but the details are lost as the need is lost as for the slave owners being stupid yes they were but most people would not be able to recognize a change in a persons appearance as some form of secretive signaling consider how skeptical you are even now having heard stories of maps in cornrows imagine how likely you would have been to suspect that was happening when not knowing about it at all not to say this is proof of any of these methods actually being true just that they dont exactly seem implausible enough to doubt practical creativity under duress is astounding,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdGMFVIZG1BX0hpY3JhVFhhME9NWXpIQ3Y3Y2UzazFIWkVQczdEVUNPUmtMTXBCNFlOVjhjN0s4TVlIV1FoQVA0M2RyMVBzY2NIaUlYZlFURFZOV2tBdnc9PQ==

as an engineer i can partially answer this first a lot though not all of engineering efforts become simpler if you have enough resources in terms of material time money and so on if you value stability and endurance more than cost efficiency things get a bit easier also some requirements were simply less challenging if you want to build a road now you have to take into account the weights of cars semi trucks and other heavy vehicles in ancient times loaded horse carriages were probably the heaviest vehicles less weight and less traffic not everybody had a carriage means less load on the road another example is given by skyscrapers nowadays skyscrapers and very tall buildings are pretty common for many reasons including high population density most ancient buildings are not that tall the colosseum in rome one of the most famous ancient buildings is only <number> ft tall which is not that much by modern standards the most challenging requirement in many cases was endurance like this thing should last a century or <number> years or more with some exceptions like columns large things survive better with columns and pillars you have to be careful because columns can crumble under their own weight but this was already known to the romans and probably other civilizations you dont need advanced math for this run some tests notice a pattern measure the ratio between width amd height and write that down finally theres an obvious survivorship bias what we see is what survived to these years most people lived in houses that have been destroyed by the times and by humans hope this helps,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdHTTE1a0U4TlJHRTNNRDFZbG1SQW92NThCUkl5d2RKVjA0M1RpMnlUT1M3aUZObEY1UlNyc0k4RjlhX1NuakFUZl9nVG5iZVlOZ3k0UjhTc2JITEc5VlE9PQ==

i think the miscommunication thats happening over your post is due to the phrasing of your second sentence here it reads as it was an expressly forbidden opinion in my basic us history course in college to claimthat they did not descend from common african ancestry the issue is that so in this context could be read as referring to the concept expressed in the previous sentence but it could also be read as referring to the contradictory idea that their ancestors did in fact descend so which is how you intended it to be read also yikes where the hell did you go to college where they were teaching that,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdHMlRmVGo2YWdfdlljdTBTNnBjNnhZaEVmZTdPeEx5ci1GTkk1RDI0NFYteUhGZW15THNqX3hKdktZMDRUeTFfMjh5aEw4cmpQNk0zWnlCak1NSUVlcThGTlU5bWYyYTN5dkdQVGJLWUVLNXc9

as a hunter i can tell you that some of them animals have fairly thick skin thick enough to require specialty firearms and ammo ammo like <number> hh or <number> ruger which have a muzzle energy in the <number><number> ftlb having never hunted anything that big i would probably prefer something like a javelin missile or a mm roundbut both of those would be a pita to drag into the bush i seriously doubt that even with a charging mammoth a thrown spear could generate anywhere near that energy to penetrate not only the hide but pierce to sufficient depth to cause a debilitating wound additionally this is support by the standard pikemen tactic vs a charging cavalry line dig the butt into the ground and let them do all the hard work in killing themselves,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdIcFJ3ajZxX3BTdm1NUWNUTzNoaHJQUkc5X3BqczFPZldTR1lzaE5FUG10Y2hvY21BVll0Rl9CZnlRTi04TGVGS29wbkI4bngtTnNZM0RZQTE5Q0IxZHVsZy1TQlhKS0xITWFmMnBXdzlwUGs9

i recall poison was traditionally used by indigenous african hunters when hunting elephants and rhinos the liangulu people of kenya augmented poisoned arrows with powerful longbows able to penetrate the hides of these animals reported killing thousands of elephants each year this way for the ivory trade well into the s firearms have been common in subsaharan africa since the s when tens of thousands of europeanmade firearms flowed into the region to fuel the atlantic slave trade the decline of elephant population in the continent probably had more to do with the rapid expansion of the african ivory trade in the s to fulfill the demand in industrializing economies of europe us etc,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdIWjJYN1NxSjhsZWpJbGpOZENvdy1zREpiRTVydDNVMU9HSEh3WGpuMnAxYWlIRlNXN3ZVVzIwMWFpQjlPRDZFZzJ0aUliS29rWVp1eFdhc3JyRTNXdnc9PQ==

yep for most of us anthropologists most recent research and dna analysis shows that homosapiens came out of africa about <number> millennia ago and emigrated to eurasia there they coexisted with the native neanderthal population for <number> or <number> millennia slowly subsuming them through a combination of conquest forced tribute enslavement and even voluntary intermarriage but the smaller more intelligent homosapiens won out over the long term with modern eurasians and their descendants in polynesia and the new world having only <number> or <number> neanderthal dna but thats not the case with people native to africa a quickly drying climate due to changing ocean currents from the closing of the isthmus of panama around this time led to the rapid deforestation and desertification of central africa effectively cutting off subsaharan africa from migration of those with neanderthal dna from eurasia so africans today are more highly evolved and more human than anyone else on earth tell that to the next loser you see flying a confederate flag,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdIUldpLWNHODk3NlM1WEhsSl81T1hudTZGR19zT2lYenczcEc0WHJoSV9jTDFsdXQyVzNoTHFJN1BJSmZubVVIV0hfUXpEbmxzQ3p3enNvaFZ1OExRdW1rcGZ1SlhTRi1UT25hSHZUbmhtS3M9

why not by the previous commentors point these mammoths were too smart and dangerous for small hairless apes to throw spears at but at the same time can be frightened enough by said smaller hairless apes to flee and be directed into planted pointy sticks as i see it both methods of hunting are probably valid and their use probably depended on the circumstance or environment,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdIYUVRcmxNWER3aFZ2X1M0dFJQRGtWdzBXUG5kUC15cHNqUHFTMHZqTVBwU0g2NmhQdFFvRmpvUTFLOGllSkRacWNqdmZ3Y1FFaGtVd2dyUHF5MVl4Q2c9PQ==

i mean its the same technique that north american aboriginals used to hunt big game its well understood and was widely used because its the best way to do it you go out in a pretty big hunting group set your pike traps bait it in with noise and arrows then you have a few of your most athletic guys break off and draw aggro while the larger group stays back using its size in numbers to redirect if needed or keep back another large animal if its not alone once its tired out or sufficiently fucking irritated and confused by these annoying ass homo sapiens it chases one into the pike trap that the runner dodges thats when the rest of the group pops out of hiding and absolutely fucking shishkebabs the animal main tactics are using our superior cardiovascular endurance wrinkly brain pointy stick and the animals own mass and velocity behind it,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdILU1rRDBXZTRqX0lhaG9scU5KNlNhTVQ1SkZ4RkN6S1hSZGxtY04wUDd4QUt5dkYyaVd6alZCeTZSR3hXU1BERWNmbGlBTEJYc2FPbmFyQkZSTVo5d3c9PQ==

we are always looking to find new answers its a requirement of the field we conduct whats called original research throughout our careers its a requirement to even get a phd and sometimes an ma original research should be something that no one has done before but it usually isnt like hey i discovered a country no one knew existed but smaller in scope like this vase type may have been made by a similar artist that worked in this other area as evident by the use of a specific stroke that no one noticed before i wouldnt say theres anything as big as consciousness but certainly large areas of debate because we are constantly publishing new ideas and new original research we may run into conflict and usually do with someone elses hypothesis they might look at that vase type that one person argued was a similar artist and say its actually proof of a brand new unidentified artist because it looks like the stroke was done by a left hand while the other one was right etc over time the left and right crowds will debate and eventually there will be some consensus for the most part theres still some big quests like translating linear a finding alexander the greats tomb etc but its a lot of small pieces of evidence and small steps and it takes a lot of time and for the most part never makes the news because its quite boring to most people one question thats mostly been answered but was debated for a long time with great arguments from both sides is who invented the trireme you can go down that track if you want to see what this sort of argument looked like and how it slowly got solved,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdIZ0NzeTFCSDZTZTYtWmxMUEM2a1RDWkYzX0laWDJWdTZiejRTT0x3MXpiY3hNWFFaNFpsUzREd2RKMnZlTDRHNXdXR0FXNW9yOTh3eEMtMkVjYzVSX0E9PQ==

difficulty is that we have the tools they used big heavy projectile points are worthless against small game and extravagantly wasteful against medium sized things skinned game like deer there is a reason why they had them there are all kinds of ways you can hunt large dangerous and thickskinned prey in relative safety though dying on a hunt was probably a regular occurrence for example you can attack from a position at a choke point or from elevated terrain where the animals cant get to you ive seen this done by bow hunters going after african elephants you could also panic them into stampeding perhaps by setting a wildfire and they might not even notice theyve been hit initially just from the adrenaline or if they do might not have noticed their attacker or judged that sticking around to stomp thag simpson for hurting them is a bad idea risking being burnt to death also remember this isnt about individual hunters no one person can process an elephant regardless of how shaggy it is it would have been a whole tribe effort also even thick skinned game like elephants can be effectively killed with primitive weaponry they kill differently than firearms yes firearms destroy tissue by crushing this is why the ability of a bullet to kill is dominated by <number>mv^<number> arrows spears and atlatl darts kill by cutting tissue not crushing it you dont need nearly as much energy plus youre making assumptions about what an extinct animal will do based upon living species we know african elephants can be aggressive when attacked or disturbed but african wildlife is like that because of all of the predators and aggressive herbivores asian elephants can also be aggressive but they are not as aggressive as their cousins on the dark continent we simply dont know how mammoths and mastodons would have reacted implicit in the argument you are making is that because you cant imagine a way to hunt mammoths safely without modern firearms our ancestors couldnt either also the assumption that they cared for their personal individual safety as much as first world modern technological humans do today i think both are facially invalid assumptions and actually rather insulting there is a kind of haughty derision behind your post that because our ancestors had primitive technology that they werent as intelligent as we are today this is erich von danikenlevel thinking egyptians couldnt possibly have built the pyramids so aliens except they were smart enough evidently smarter than some impressively credentialed people today,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPM2dUeE5NWTV5WmhYOHJoQWZfbUw0Y2hzc1QwNUJETUpvUVlEcGpLUi1XMi00QlR4SE5RVjVoM0IyOHdoWS1ycXVjcXBsbXRGT1lVLURjVnJIYkktc1E9PQ==

again lack of imagination first of all they were probably using atlatls to throw their spears actually the terminology is darts we have atlatl weights from the time period for example and you need the extra leverage to throw a dart a significant distance the darts would have had a removable foreshaft with the projectile point because the points are relatively fragile and break easily on vigorous contact with a hard surface like a rock and sometimes even bone being able to easily replace the point on a dart or an arrow is why foreshafts are used atlatls also allow you quite a bit of extra range more than you might imagine current world record for the javelin is about <number> meters world record for an atlatl dart is <number> meters im not suggesting that our ancestors shot at mammoths from <number>+ yards but it gives you an idea of the relative distance between throwing a spear and throwing an atlatl dart if you can throw a hunting spear <number> meters you can probably do <number> meters with an equivalent dart and its not just one person youve got a group of men all launching darts at manny the mammoth probably spread out fairly evenly and if the mammoth goes after thag ogg and tumak and the boys are going to be attacking him from the sides all it takes is one dart to penetrate into the lungs to eventually kill the mammoth and thats a pretty big target yeah modern technology allows a single individual to go up against an elephant with relatively little danger but a group of individuals with primitive technology can also be effective btw have you ever made stone tools and projectile points i have im not good enough to make a clovis or folsom point but i have made smaller pieces and you wouldnt believe how unbelievably sharp they are far sharper than any steel blade for hunting something like deer small bird points are perfectly adequate there is a reason why people back then made relatively huge and technically difficult to make points to hunt very large thickskinned game,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPa2Vhd0Vab1JLdlRLNkE1a1RNckRkRnZQNjdjd21MVXFvZGZqVS1qMDJqVUVMUDJzQUQ5eGJsUmhiWkliUFZCSUU3SndZcjUzSDBiUGRabEN2VlN5OXc9PQ==

a favourite trope of those who decry the british impact on india is to glorify its previous mughal empire as a golden age of both economic prosperity and benevolent government mughal india we are told accounted for roughly <number> of world gdp in <number> before british rule falling to a minuscule <number> per cent when the british left in <number> what that glib comparison overlooks is the fact that india in <number> also had <number> per cent of the worlds population meaning that its per capita gdp the real measure of prosperity was relatively low due to its poor productivity as a largely agrarian economy on the eve of global industrialisation which exponentially multiplied world gdp indeed per capita income had been declining since <number> when the mughal empire arguably peaked under its most illustrious emperor akbar according to the maddison project the major drop in indias per capita gdp occurred between <number> and <number> and was stagnant thereafter till <number> in <number> indias per capita income was roughly half that of britains at <cur><number> compared with <cur><number> for england it had fallen from <cur><number> in <number> showing a decline well before the breakup of the mughal empire per capita gdp fell further to <cur><number> in <number> just after the british took over then went up to <cur><number> in <number> thanks to british indias rajinspired industrial revolution but dropped again to <cur><number> in <number> due to the world recession after ww the reasons for indias historically low productivity were manifold textiles indias main export were already declining in the s because its labourintensive technology was unable to compete with europes more technologically innovative handloom sector underlying mughal indias technological stagnation was the fact that no agricultural surplus was being reinvested because it was instead being creamed off by a rentier feudal class because wages levels were low in india producers preferred to increase output by hiring more workers rather than investing in new technology an estimated <number> per cent of the mughal empire was not administered directly but farmed out to feudal taxcollectors known as jagirdars in return for military service jagirdars were only appointed for a few years at a time with the result that their prime incentive was to extract as much from their districts as possible as quickly as possible with minimal longterm investment in new technology or irrigation the resulting decline in mughal agricultural productivity pushed up both food and textile prices thereby adding to the loss of foreign market share although india now had to compete in rapidly expanding world markets due to the industrial revolution in western europe mughal india unlike europe had neither autonomous cities nor a merchant class strong enough to offset these agrarian parasites at the peak of the raj the british rulers were a very thin layer at the top of society who took about <number> of national income their allies the native princes and zamindars took another <number> <number> is a sizeable proportion for a ruling class to cream off but under the mughal regime the equivalent group had collected <number> of national income in taxes and spent most of it on their own consumption the leading historian of mughal india irfan habib concludes that not only was the mughal empire its own gravedigger but no new order was or could be created by the forces ranged against it the political collapse of the mughal empire resulted in an even less economically conducive state of affairs though not literally anarchy it was a disintegration into regional warlordism with predictable results the collapse of imperial authority resulted in what economic historians have identified as a period of deindustrialization much before the dominance of the east india company imperial decline and constant internecine warfare reduced agricultural land acreage and productivity which drove up food prices then nominal wages and then textile prices in an inflationary chain reaction which cost india textile market share in britain even before the latter developed factory technology wrongly blamed for that decline between <number> and <number> the loss of mughal hegemony allowed new despotic rulers to revenue farm their conquered populations seeing tax and rent demands increase to as much as <number> per cent of production compared to only <number> to <number> extracted in china during the same period and levied largely to fund regional warfare combined with the use of labour and livestock for martial purposes grain and textile prices were driven up along with nominal wages reducing the competitiveness of indian handicrafts and impacting even the domestic textile trade the parallel political death of mughal india derived from a combination of factors such as imperial overstretch fratricidal wars of succession and finally the cataclysmic invasions of the persian ruler nadir shah in <number> followed by those of the afghans under ahmad shah abdali scarcely less invasive were the raids across the subcontinent by the

this is a touchy area bc people misconstrue how the atlantic slave system worked to turn blame back around on the various african people but europeans didnt penetrate into africa it was largely a mystery to them thus dark africa there was some initial raiding on the coast but it was generally easier to just set up a trading post on the coast they set up forts on the coast and would purchase enslaved people that were brought to them there were fights between various europeans in different places at different times but they were to control these areas however none of this in anyway supports a the africans caused the slave trade type commentary you get from people trying to minimize european involvement in the slave trade as something they passively accepted or was foisted on them thats not at all what happened,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdReXNvODFFZXhBUTY0VkdvYUxFRXBXbnBxRUllT3FSVTJsRU9XdkVfMm00MTM1b3Z0Q1BQc1FpTndHMXNibmVtZEpBcjBpbkVUN0lLVzFFeGw2VEdPWHc9PQ==

great questions there was totally a budding environmentalist movement by the s but folks wouldnt have used that name they called themselves conservationists naturalists or preservationists just consider folks like john muir who was a major force pushing for the creation of us national parks or gifford pinchot whose family owned a big lumber business but the son was shocked at how private business had denuded and exploited the american countryside the first national park founded is yellowstone in <number> it would then be founded by many others soon after rdr is set during the presidency of teddy roosevelt in fact one of the coolest thing the game could have done is in the <number> epilogue with john marston it could have shown the creation of new parks during the years after morgan died that would have been really accurate and cool,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSZGdIRE5GZkZfNUtoQ3JuRl9hSXRUOGFuRWtwMEdRekxpWm5jeVlQODJ3bjZkcExwTGN4N0FHN19ZNlQ5U1dHMzBsSVVKMFcxTWl4Y0xGYmV2WHJyM21XcXVpdW1SVnFTbHlqUDg2RWpXdEE9

you know i didnt spend nearly enough time thinking about either of those groups mainly because theyre somewhat peripheral to the main story but i did spend a lot of time thinking about the murfree brood another group of murderous isolated folks i came to the conclusion that these guys are cut from the cloth of the worst stereotypes of southern appalachia rather than actual history itself theyre pulled from movies like deliverance <number> more than anything else as i explain in the book there was a really long campaign across the us to make white southern mountain people look exotic backward different and preserved in amber the obsession with rural violence is part of that but ultimately this myth was invented rather than real and it was really propagated in order to justify the siphoning of wealth from the mountains outward mainly coal and timber was the us west unusually violent in the late s some places were in boom towns where you had a lot of strangers flooding in especially when it was mainly men from a range of racialethnic groups violence tended to be more common there were fewer social bonds preventing violence and bullets often flew as a result the homicide rates in some of these towns was as high as <number> per <number> which is way higher than any us cities today but many pockets of the west were really tame and tranquil with very low violence rates especially where the population was more homogenous and the balance of women and men was more equal,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUzQ1XzRfbUgzaGVJTWlFcGM1QXZvdDBLM1U0cXRCSk9iNTBHNXRVUTFwM29FdGVMVnc1cHk3N0tSUUJWRmFVaGVTRjYwVlBsbGRKdkozZ3lmendQWUoxQWpZZlZMNjliSFBXMTNIbFBMclk9

hey thanks for asking so i learned so many things researching and writing red deads history heres just one one of the most infamous cases in us supreme court history is plessy v ferguson <number> which basically gave the green light to legalized racial segregation in the us south it was this case that the black freedom struggle sought to overturn in the s and s but i learned and this shocked me that there was one dissenting member of the court who voted against his <number> colleagues in <number> not only was this guy john marshall harlan from kentucky but he was a former slaveholder but by <number> he was a firm believer in racial equality and especially equality before the law who says people cant change learning that blew me away also hilarious because he was named after john marshall one of the first supreme court justices in the nation talk about someone living up to their names destiny,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSblpQbk1pcHdqTG9qeXJKYk1CRFgwdGRiNnR5c2pybklBUmlGWHIwWnJYTzJSendOVGpyWG1MVWJxUHNxeFhZblU1WEQ1elJHQ3JoRTQzcGlvamJpUVBiSi1OWVFYc1ZCek5VUVhidjhaYU09
so i actually devote three chapters of my book to butcher creek because i think its a standin for southern appalachia ie west virginia eastern kentucky eastern tennessee western north carolina etc this was a region that was torn apart by big corporations from outside the region in this very era which produced a ton of ill effects for local residents deforestation destroyed peasant economies in the woods and coal mining in company towns shortened life spans as well overall i think rdr has a dr jekyllmr hyde take on southern appalachia on one hand they recycle all of the most tired stereotypes of the region with its bearded archaic uneducated trappedinamber hillbillies who are isolated from american progress but then it also shows how wall street ie leviticus cornwall was tearing asunder the region in pursuit of wealth so i play around with that duality a lot in the book,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSRE91aWN4eTI0dEx6MVlpdjBnS0JBY3gyX2ozTnVITUU5WE1oUE45Nms1NkdzbHZ4SFVBQjRsWUVpN1FtakNVUVVJamNqQlJJdFhEVGRYVVlJdnVTdjhGZEdtcGMzMlJxZnlNdDM5bnBrU2M9
yes when i first taught the class i did several weeks on rdr and the mexican revolution in <number> and i hate that there wasnt space in the book to include this i think its one of the key ways that the first rdr surpasses the second and allows me to talk about a really dramatic moment in north american history likewise i really wanted to do more with americas imperial push of <number><number> in cuba the philippines and beyond uncle even references the philippines while sitting around the campfire but i had to cut it sadly so theres lots more to talk about that i dont cover maybe a second edition,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSVW9tSFZPUXdoMi1BbnpXcS1JbHQ4WnJFZl9vcTlSa25zLXlJZS10ZFd3OU9WU1FjTnQyS0ZCdmxGbHhjb1k4a0xLVjBtM0pfMTVycFN0eF9LYjBENDJranlxRnBfNUtncDNBRFVKWjVWR0E9

feels like the kind of thing that goes hand in hand with the mythology of the west where a lot of the image and motif owes to the era of the late s through the s but games books and movies especially now like to frame themselves as taking place in the waning years of the wild wild west inadvertently flipping and transposing elements into a time period where theyre out of place,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUmJxX08tLWdobVV3VW11emtvV3lyamZjUW90ZGpxUENYZU96OHBweWVtMTFYVE1XSjMxdDVoVFIyNURkd1BpWVF5eVFpTDlPaUQxcjlVcmlkRXRqRmc9PQ==

such a great question so the american diet was changing really quickly in the late s with the rise of massive food processors like the chicago meatpackers swift armour morris etc and these new titans of industry began selling new foods that americans had never seen before mainly to get rid of their waste products and earn a dime in the process consider oleomargarine processed beef tallow with salt and yellow coloring added so that it would resemble butter but way grosser they even marketed it by deceptive names like butterine to try to trick folks into buying it same goes for canned beef another disgusting byproduct of the chicago packinghouses have you heard of upton sinclairs famous book the jungle <number> it was a hugely influential book and led to the passing of the pure food and drug act soon thereafter given that rdr is set a few years before that act i think selling something like salted offal would have been totally realistic but i bet the chicago packers would have called it by some more deceptively appetizing name but yes processed industrial foods in this era were often disgusting people ate it because it was cheap and they didnt have that many other options especially poor urban folks,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUkVTd1d6eXNEWE1RMFFqMlkwclhNOUQ0R1E2MmlyLXJ3VTZGQUhucDJpbkZtSkZBVGF3WUp0NThuemVPMDBDWGZ5cGdvYjRXaklUM2dsTlZRdmlucmU5eTZNdVRaanQ2Z1Jxd1Iyc2gyckk9

no it was actually <number> so the game is a bit off haha just kidding yeah the games geography is obviously crazy and lets remember that the map is not just supposed to contain the west but also the deep south new orleans and southern appalachia its not shocking that the game map is so big but of course still soo much smaller than the reality for arthur to ride from the far west to new orleans in <number> would have taken weeks but only takes like <number> minutes in the game this is one topic that gamers dont actually want realism in their games it would make things so boring,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSVVJTWTQ2MExLMXZ4VmphZjgzTC1DSjh5ZGtaV0w0XzFFbUVWUy1hSVVEeHNUZkRxQUJkRVowTnZyNzJtRTlmVXA2dGFNdURHejVsSVV4QlpKYTZNanVEZHpMZ2w2ZnRJX0oteWZUNGk2UEE9

hey i love the score and soundtrack of the game but for very nonhistorical reasons who doesnt love willy nelson and rhiannon giddens or woody jackson but you know i havent thought all that much about the campfire songs i need to look into it more which are your favorites can you send some clips of them from youtube for the more edgy details of american history thankfully theres dozens of books about sexuality and romantic culture given that the gta games featured prostitution within their game worlds its somewhat surprising that rdr doesnt given the prevalence of this practice around the turn of the century but i am happy that they didnt because im so tired of rockstar games that only treat women as sexual objects the female characters of the van der linde gang are thankfully so much more than that you know what id like to see more of in the game openly gay characters one might think oh people werent out of the closet in that period but thats totally wrong indeed the idea of a closet didnt even exist in the s there was much more public awareness of queer identities at that moment than there would have been in the s or even s as george chauncey writes in his amazing book gay new york which is set at this time period there would have been very different conventions regarding sex than there were later in the th century,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSQ1R6dmkwZjVhN3QzTzVDVnphZXhUUV9fa2VFQ1l5bnZnZGFiWUN1NWRVY0UyZ0JodjlBS3FDRHd1OWtyXzBWZVpiOWpmVFZvb01lczdYaWZqblM3NUx4UFdkajhzdWN0M3M4Z3YwRXQ0Szg9

thats perhaps part of it but then theres slavery and the civil war which is the source of so much bloodshed and i think a lot of the violence of the us had to do with its astounding diversity and heterogeneity you had people of different religions races classes languages religions and belief systems all mixing in this crazy pot england france and germany werent nearly as diverse and sometimes these differences erupted into hatred and bloodshed,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUWZEaV84NERDU2w5eDFyQlFHOFRMTE9XeGRhUmp5b0JjNVhsMUF6akNXNnVSQ1B0ZlNBWEhhSmdXckwyTE84QzN0NW5BNDJnRkVxZEpaYld0NE5tU3h5Uy1xaVhzRi02ZTNGbXdJeEJUeXM9
ill also throw out that those characters were from the east coast and probably influenced by whitman and the other transcendental poets there was also a movement in europe beginning in the <number>s and <number>s that generated a lot of romantic landscape art essentially depicting the unspoiled purity of nature and gods country the transcendental poets were the literary successors of this romanticism and they had an impact before the turn of the century,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSU3FvaDg2azBpS0pRY19VX3JCTTNPN2Nwb2paaGxZTXRWZ3RSZ3RrWmdCTFFhNGJ5TmM2WkRqYWFMNDJwLWNkbG5rNDdRTHFhcnJvV2p0RlM1ZHRvU1hsSmRyQ1hKeWdYdnNjNHJWV3Faa2M9
this is also one of the reasons why the american working class had a harder time mobilizing and winning social reforms like their counterparts in northern europe the american working class was divided by race religion region etc and bosses learned that it was easy to turn them against each other along those lines heck the corporate bosses today continue to use the same lessons to divide working people,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSWVA3Ni1hdFRwa2hya2hFWUo1aVhHcWpndEVHdnZaWmlRZDFoM1o3eTVrYmVsdmlJMmpJbGRDYWE5ZlVBeEMtaVJWSHUtNGFTNVoyRldZS19VZDExNTBiUDdQQmRvSUlNU0RkeXZVOHN6Ums9

hey so the national audubon society was founded in <number> so just after rdr and they were all about bird preservation and habitat protection though many shot birds too to paint and admire them so there was clearly a movement budding at the time what i find a bit paradoxical about rdr though is that it portrays rural america as this place teeming with wildlife almost as an edenic garden untouched by humanity thats really far from the truth the s were actually a terrible time to be a wild animal the bison was on the verge of extinction with only a few hundred left alive and the passenger pigeon a bird that had literally darkened the skies with their massive flocks in the earlier years of the s had gone extinct around the turn of the century the american landscape was in many ways gutted and denuded at that moment that is what spurred the national parks and conservation movements in large part,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUVRXUzBGcW9FQjB3a3lXMlc3REZydVpIQVZKd0FFT0kyRHhuQXJpVDNUUndXTk9WZ2pYSGhUV2plZmlHRjZ0TEtqN1BpTnFtekpoNVlVakJOMk02QkNmUmxOQktsMHQxTlhIc3N2elp3U289
hey so glad you enjoyed the book isnt roger such an amazing narrator i think hands down the most historically accurate location in the game is saint denis as new orleans the architecture and layout is so spot on and in terms of social fabric the game is also right to show the diversity and cosmopolitanism of that city it had a large black population and many immigrants and lots of sicilians too though they werent mob bosses just workingclass folks really saint denis is my favorite spot in the gamei keep returning there again and again,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSbE5CbmZZc3ZvQWRWY2RjSGVvV29JNEF2VXRrMEZEYW9aM25haWctdVh2cHRFRVl6TEJsRGUzR0YtODdmeUQ3X3FhbFVUMExWaE9JTDFEeDY4R29HWGlkbWlHdHVFOXhJY0hrUlVPeFJFMDg9
hah yes its a very good point before world war ii the population of the west was really low the advent of the air condition really helped change that who would want to live in houston or phoenix without that ugh but just as important was the interstate highway system which was the th century equivalent to the railroad and military spending too which funneled government dollars into places like la orange county dallas southern florida etc you know the first word spoken on the moon was houston thanks militaryindustrial complex and your love for the sunbelt,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSU0QwXzM0UzZKd1VOYjd2ZHlsSHdka3JndGNkVUJ1RlhrcVpGZ1QwTldEd2JQcUNlcTlMc3dydHBPU2NvT0dZelpIbEh2ZFQybWktdmVFb211QVhxSWx4dmwxVDRZUmRSZ19jd05TSmJDVEk9

yeah in my head i thought playing charles father for the first chapter then you play charles and in the last chapter you meet the gang you experience the wild west from a natives perspective because at the start of rdr arthur asks charles why you with us you could run a gang by yourself and that implied to me that charles was a very experienced man before he met the gang you guys will win the world cup one day us soccer is improving very well thank you,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSQXhPczYtNjdJcTlQSGxFZ1FzTTVKZm0zNG12blFFRDRjVG9iQzN0eElSeGNaUXBpMk5vbDVBczI0aEtMYkphU25fNFJvXzZUSWxKVlNPMUNCQWlIQ1E9PQ==

i have read many histories and narratives on this subject and there is reason to be skeptical while there are instances where a collective group of slaves may work together on a specific scheme to steal food or even beatkill an overseer or even rarely a master the development of a communication system like this is unlikely black slaves were not a uniformed collection of brothers and sisters united in solidarity the institution was setup to ensure they werent for every <number> slaves there were two who legitimately loved their white folk the slave next to you could be sold tomorrow why be loyal to him in short masters would know every part of that system prohibit its use and punish anyone using it snitching was very real and very common youd have to get past a boss the highest ranking mean black slave and the twofaced old slaves who were paid in food and candy while slaves were in bondage theoretically they werent always in bondage and in a position to want to escape a plantation was an ordered system around forced labor that people were born into the typical mindset evaluated ones condition by how much the master kept up his part of the arrangement food seasonal clothes medical care housing arrangement time offleisure time and whether the overseers were allowed to be brutal when the yankees came many opted to stay after the war many including my family on both sides opted to be sharecroppers my white folks was good to me is common in many of the slave narratives i say this to say that these urban legends come about because americans black and white refuse to think critically about the brainwashing involved in the institution sure you had patrols slave catchers and bounty hunters but the system on the plantation including your kin made a systemic strategy to run away all of the time nowhere in the common slaves psyche they couldnt envision a change of order unless they were kidnapped or separated from the family via sale or gift,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSVFBvQjNXQ2tTSnRlcnhlWUlOTE4zWnlPRnN5NVhtY0VYcndxaU9tU2FUdWZpLXhNWU5DZHlLbWgzQVQ1T25TVTVQdGE4V25ob3R5YXhTQl9IZlFDdmpLUkR4ZDVoeHE5R25YblNCYVVWUzg9

when you go back in history you will find that people had a very good understanding of practical engineering or the end result but not the why which is a focus of modern engineering for example a plumb bob is a straight vertical line down why and how nope it just does water finds its own level it just does exactly why and what vectors and forces cause this nope this applied to a lot of science agriculture plants grew better when pee was dumped on the plant yes that is because urine is rich in nitrogen and nitrogen helps plants grow but exactly how history guy nope chemistry fire burns hotter when its is blown on yes combustion happens because of oxidization and air contains oxygen but did they know that air contained oxygen nope metallurgy copper gets harder and brittle when worked it happens because hammering introduces defects in the crystalline structure of the metal what crystals i dont see crystals but i do know that when i hammer copper it gets hard and can hold an edge but if i want to soften it i heat it up biology if i coat a wound with honey it doesnt turn green and smelly and the person doesnt die yes the high sugar content of honey has antiseptic properties because the sugar content at this level is toxic to aerobic because hydrogen peroxide ho and methylglyoxal mgo actively kill bacterial cells nope it just happens because melisseus blesses us many of these things were the secrets of masons farmers smiths and healers and they were guarded jealously for example look at the medieval guilds they guarded those secrets jealously and were only passed on from master to apprentice,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdob251NFBIZ1otRXJ2MFFPeGY3alotaWRpa2JIYldHYXhLOGJRVHNEQmxLNFJZNEdFTXNLTFQ3TVR3QWJNeHZFWVpvSHZ1VTllQTVKcHRhdWNlYTV5ZjdfcG9Qelg3VjB3a2pFSjNGQjByWVE9

so i just want to start by saying that i am currently listening to your audiobook and am thoroughly enjoying it i also am so happy that i learned about it by complete accident i just recently started a new full time job for a local to me university and during some of my new employee orientation training i met a professor of environmental science that supposedly knows you and she suggested your book the only reason she brought it up is because during one of the icebreaker activities i brought up that my kids are named after characters in rdrrdr yes you read that right my wife and i have had such a love and connection with the games that we named our twins after two of its characters so your book per her suggestion was and has been perfect for me i hope to see more content like yours in the years to come because i believe like you do that history presented in the context of gaming can usher in a whole new generation of history lovers anyway i dont really have a question yet as i havent finished the audiobook i just wanted to give my kudos to you and say its hilarious that i literally learned of your book this past thursday bought the audiobook on saturday and see today that you posted an ama i wish you the best and look forward to keeping up with your future work,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdpSndySU9oQk54SERQV3RVWjlOaXo0dFZ0ZkpmN2JoN1NSTEJYdjFHNmJnNDR1d3lEWkcweUJDV0ZmMGtxRnZuU2RsZ3RGQU1DSS1QRy1fQUxPQVRlNHc9PQ==

thats a pretty subjective statement i consider the mountain men and early explorers as part of the wild west and their legacy goes back to the mid th century i suppose youre specifically talking about cattle drives and cowboysrange wars and fighting native americans in the late s even that isnt accurate as the chisholm and oregon trail <number> to <number> were open for decades before that s the first large scale cattle drive was in s as well nearly every book documentary or tv show ive seen breaks down the wild west into a <number> year period,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqR2RfZlo1MC1BdDJaaEMtNXlrWlNMSXNlbEg3NWhQSjMxU1BnODhKaHA2eHJoMjd5TWNoM0hnbmJzb012VGdNYU1peW9IV3BqQ3A3YzhXdUhmbFMzLVE9PQ==
not op but im a big history fan with s being one of my favorite eras of history the skinners are most likely based off scalp hunting gangs the government put bounties on the scalps of natives they were generally priced as adult or child yes the government from time to time would offer bounties for the scalps of native children now theres no famousinfamous scalp hunting gang but it was often done in groups because attacking a native village or hunting party by yourself is how you end up dead also it wasnt unheard of for scalp hunters in the southwestern part of america to kill and scalp mexican because like native americans theyve got darker skin and dark black hair and in the s prove that its native and not mexican or vice versa now i say all of that to say that its no impossible that a scalp hunting group got to the point where they enjoyed what they did but native scalp bounties largely ended at the same time as the indian wars ended so its not impossible for a group of bloodthirsty and sadistic scalp hunter to turn their attention from nativesmexicans to anyone and everyone they find,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqaWg0aWhWRE0ycWRVd3prRnFnVU9CRzNtTWRhS0FUazk3bmFySDRrZFdRZjVEUWRnNWprZnIxOGhZd2txTlBqb1ZLMEJXanNXTk1pb0RIU0pEdnJacGc9PQ==

the us did not intend to have a standing army they would only be called up when needed as they viewed standing armies as tools of oppressors boston massacre quartering act etc instead militias would act as local defense in response to immediate action which would give towns and cities further down the road time to prepare and a wider call up of troops if necessary this is viewable in the original text >a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed when the british invaded one of the first things they did in certain areas was go after the gun powder supplies these were rally points where local militias would go and get the supplies they needed besides those kept at home ensuring people could still have militias to defend the area against tyrannical peoples including their own government was seen as necessary in reaction to the ongoing revolution against the colonies government this was written with revolution in mind personal rights of gun ownership were of course something as well but that sort of thing wasnt really heavily debated at this point there would be no real need to tell people they could have guns because of course they could,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PV05NYkpBQ0lKS3l3OTRDVVJBb2dBNUg5eVdKajBNVmJ1WWZILXlpTmEyY1FhYVJLVlRZU1ZFUi11UFc1SmJKaGNvdk5Yczc1QXdkR21tc0QwZlA1cmc9PQ==

i do not think its weird but i agree that it is very rough and possibly simplistic its important to realise the defenders in masada were not highly regarded by the jewish defenders who threw them out of jerusalem nor was their military skill highly regarded this question the traditional view of a threeyear siege would require massive resources from the roman army i remember reading a military historian if such a siege was done by the romans it could be done with a much smaller force the fact that a very short timeframe of months is possible must mean something here of course now without more precise archaeological or historical evidence its difficult to pinpoint a timeframe,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZeVdzVUgyUGUwaUJfRHp1RXpOTHJfdzYzcUR3N2YtM2tvQzFZRDBYMHRSUEZGWFBwZGpPTkFGVUpQelBWOVVZWTVLaXJYR1lQRlZHOXhpMjJ3NGN2M0E9PQ==

i flipped through my books and i couldnt find anything like that i have mostly evans stuff i would try and check out the index for the kershaw or ullrich biographies though obviously not showing up in a few books isnt proof of anything but one thing that indicates to me that it wasnt is that i looked through evans book lying about hitler he wrote it after the irvinglipstadt trial to address the lies that irving was pushing forward in neo nazi circles what happens today isnt necessarily an indication of what happened in the past but so many of the neo naziholocaust denierantisemite claims today are just rehashed claims from the nazis that if it was a frequent argument back then you would see something about it now the fact i didnt makes me think if it was used it was used as an example of the jewishbolshevik plot for world control how jewish conspirators are already pulling the strings in the uk the jewish conspirators excuse were a rhetorical point for the nazis to explain british and american opposition to their expansion and then why fellow aryans would be at war with them,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZdkZNSVhUU2s1SXdXUlBXUEZza0FwdU84b0FxVGhldktWS05SdTlWc25uWlV5WE5CYy1YbHUwNVNPVVJCckNSTWhjdmF3WWhVYXgtTE1FeVhtZW9kaHc9PQ==

rather than the bering sea whats generally been proposed in polynesians following the changes in wind and current that come with the el nino theres now very solid evidence of polynesian contact in the precolumbian period circumstantial as it is but what seems apparent is that this contact was not consistent rather it seems there were between <number><number> depends on how you look at the evidence periods of brief but impactful contact but for whatever reason it didnt persist but theres no evidence of any contact in central america so it seems unlikely they sailed down the coast rather they seem to have sailed the sea of the south pacific island hopping as they did and el nino or other season shifts made it possible for polynesians to reach south americas northwest coast specifically,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZQzhtZnlXTndMbG8wUjhrR3A2NTFrQV9kRmMxRFhlU3VQZlpqNXhfaTIxaTMyS2U0VV9BWXZreGdLZ0IwVTBwTkVyR3dZd3FXWE9CbGNzMG1tTTExNHc9PQ==

surfing came about organically in both places i highly doubt the people on the peruvian coast taught the hawaiians how to surf i think its pointless to try and frame it as ohhh see these people actually invented surfing,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9abUlEcG5neHN1NkZ5dVNRaGloemRjWk9NbDJkMEJfTFkzRXlWb0dmNGhhZ0h5NGlzb3RHb0p1Sjk3SkZBUVdLNWpXbFFTUTBVZV9VLW5vNjFpa2h0OEE9PQ==
one is based on academic inquiry and scientific date the other is based on guesswork and vibes to be less blase thor heyerdahls work is much less how did these peoples interact and much more here is a way it is theoretically possible for someone to do this which is neat but transpacific travel was already well understood to scientists when he did his sailing when people nowadays fixate on heyerdahls work it usually ends with them ignoring indigenous people and their history and focusing instead on what feels correct,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aSTZtb3dlM0NnWUdPWlR0Rk1QZGkxYlNwZlF3WHpmLWFhUlhKeW9NTjJjcFNyaGpYQkZIaUlqQ21kUFRGTVVhaTZSTTR5TlBjVzh5SUszSmRaU1hpOEE9PQ==
i tried to use googlefu to find some resources about this but the closest i could find is a list on wikipedia of fictional materials in like star wars and lord of the rings so i wanted to ask here im looking for examples of materials from a variety of cultures folklore and mythologies whether they be entirely fictional names for materials we better understand today and call something else or even just materials that are very unique to a specific culture or something along those lines as a few examples of what i mean alkahest was the idea of a universal solvent in alchemy orichalcum is known now as a bronze alloy but was considered a special metal from atlantis adamant was a kind of unbreakable stone or mineral heck even things like fabrics such as the golden fleece from greek legend any culture is good nordic asiatic african so long as its citable id be glad to hear about it,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aZ2cyLTMtRVJ2U3p2VHlGMmMzb085ZnVMSmZVUm4yZWZuVVFROEdqX0V4VDdPRE5tZkZiNlZjX1pMclBXdG5WQkM4UC13djZhMjBONFlzdG1TWDlVMVE9PQ==
because thor heyerdahls theory also purports a mythical ancient race of white people that originated in the middle east sailed across the atlantic to found mesoamerican civilization and then further sail on from there to colonize polynesia of which there is no evidence of other than a possible exchange between the peoples of polynesia and south america,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aY2ticEV4WHhhWVItRmpIbVRDVWFvZkFBUU11cjg3bnJXVkhlaXB6UXVXblBLTWtySHhRSkxhRE5hck9SOVJBVmQyR0kwMTdHZGJVaUpxYTQtV0Y2c2c9PQ==
the problem with most important questions in history is that the older battles will basically always be the most important to us because theyve had time to cause more ripples the roman battle of teutoburg forest pretty much cant ever not be one of the most important europeans battles ever because it outlined the shape of modern western europe control over that entire geographic region by italian state or germanic groups was based on that battle by contrast whoever won at waterloo would have continued on as mutually intelligible european rulers sharing a political life with the losing party all the players involved are still around as cultural forces,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aclUzbVpMV0RqRF93ZGg3T0N4LUdyalpwRS1OYkFxZmotQnN6MXo1NHVMMzEyTkFVdE9venJ5c2t2UVV1Y1dmVXl0c0FhVjZUeF9oUGd2QVM1Zm5FSmc9PQ==

it was the polinesian who taught the hawaiians how to surf there is some very light and nondefinitive evidence that the inca tupac yupanqui travelled to polinesia and might have been the one that expanded surfing in a basic form outside the inca empire though the concept of using a hard surface to ride wave crests is definitely something that could be discovered independently in many places,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTBzTXdwQnVhSk9nQUVCR3ZiNGdjU0F3MWtSWHpqTmpPbWZicUFFc3lVM1pxVW8wLXcxQTVaY21QdVlSWmNjeUdBWFg0NVdzVXBwTWxQNUJFYTZONW0yTmc9PQ==

op inquired about the treatment of lgbt+ people under nazis ernst rohm was openly gay and cofounded the sa seems relevant given they allowed a gay person to play such a big part in hitlers rise he was ultimately killed after he served his purpose,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0SWR6b1d2NXplc0NlNFJBcF9rY2JOUlpHa3c5aDFFX0tLUnZDRlpjSzU3YlR3eFBPVktXUGJUMzJfSmxxSlpmNkNhWGlXS3NkRTRWa1BlelZUZXpfcHc9PQ==
definitely the head of the sa brownshirts by all accounts the group was very heavily filled out by gay men and sex among its members was a normal occurrence just one of the few reasons the sa fell out of favor and hitler wanted them greatly reduced homosexuality certainly wasnt the cause of the night of long knives but i think it was a consideration,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0VHk2TWZxZG5xWWJySHcwNXNFM3hXMjJpYW83TS0wRjFDTG9JUmgzM3hLSzdwUmNQWUZFdDJVM2M0MG1Kb1hfaFJfWDI5Y2ltMVVtOFl5R1BCMi15dUE9PQ==

so thats where id say its only relevant as a piece of trivia rohm was a cofounder of the gestapo but himmler headed it for its almost entire existence im by no means trying to say this is what you were suggesting but its real easy to read a statement like your original as doubting the treatment of lgbtq+ at the time based on the idea that the head of the gestapo being gay like i said not talking shit not presuming what you meant just explaining my response,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0ekJNUzZqQXUzMUVYVlNGY0xHMnEzNUt0R0lLUjQ0aW42R0IxVGlWZWExRTVWN1psWEM3ZlJmV0RMRFQwUGFvYTlnRDVzbXlMcHYzZmRiaUptQjRQU3c9PQ==

he wasnt the first nor the last gay person j edgar hoover and the current vice president of the german afd come to mind that was heavily tokenized by an immensely repressive government as a sorr of smokescreen i dont know what you are trying to say ernst rohm was gay so being gay in the reich wouldnt be that bad,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0VGx4bnVJdzFVeEFDV0ZrYUNxTThHZmxjTHZCVE01NVpZRjVTWjcwQmZjckVkcVpnZ3FJNWdkUUduTW1BdkM3NHlCbDd5N3lzbC13c2ZJb00wTlpEdVE9PQ==

its also worth noting that himmler and goebbels used the homosexuality present in the sa to ramp up persecution after the night of the long knives,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0ZjBBQ0hXdmx0OEN4cDZXNzFfNmlkNW1BakRlcnVxYWYzQ0VENTJJU1lRLXo3b2c3RUhDdzJIWHJ2MERtZ0hXUER0aWFraDV6ZWpFX01Qb0RfVTIxVmc9PQ==
rohm was certainly a coconspirator of hitlers in the dap and then the nazi party and also had a history of military service in wwi he did help establish the sa as well with that said i think based on his execution during the night of long knives itd be appropriate to conclude that hitler and the nazi party at least recognized rohms value in organizing fighters and military knowledge despite his homosexuality once the nazis assumed power in <number><number> hitler saw the sa more as a threat as they outnumbered the military and the ss and had strong working class ties that caused hitler to worry about their proximity to communism rohm was far from the only leader of the sa to be executed on the night of long knives though and while his homosexuality was probably part of the reason for his execution i think its also appropriate to say his leadership of the largest paramilitary organization in nazi germany appeared to be a threat to the new reichstag leadership in rohms case i think his homosexuality came second to his military prowess until it became necessary to get rid of him for both reasons this is all to say i think rohms being allowed to lead the sa wasnt an allowance as a gay man but as a military leader in a party who needed to organize millions of street fighters,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0ZkhpTVAxUi1uYnNrWjdBODEwYXE1VmxsYnpoUGx3NjdRWUxmYWY5N2xGajljUDZoMU1LY3N5WGFhZUctRDlCS3B3SEVlbmVJb3hySGwwSV9Nd3RkbnpxRVZaNGhVblBRMUJUUWVrTjFqUlk9

you may have meant no ill will but lets not act like theres absolutely no context for why people react how they do this isnt everybody being mean or just reading too much into things this is a piece of trivia that is brought up over and over again to make the argument that the nazis were actually run by those evil gays all along andor that gays somehow werent really persecuted by the regime even tough the persecution and indeed extermination of lgbt+ people was welldocumented again you may have meant nothing like that and may have just been asking a question about a historical curiosity but that makes you a rarity in online discussions of the topic,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1dUJYU3lEQ1NzMXQ1Nk5CT2JFRnJMbnlLUnBNWU9jdVYxZ1YxZkw3OWVTTi0wQWlWd1hqVlFsV1dXRHFEUjhzR0ZHZnNnUUtuYUp1d3Y0cWVvUko2VWdjV2dQNUlCLUZzWkJoaGRyTlFBQ1U9

thats not true the biggest group were political persecutees such as communists and socialist a disproportionate number of whom also had jewish roots my maternal side of the family came from the west to the east because in the western side the same people remained in power as during the nazi times and there were big anticommunist crackdowns whereas in the east the elite was recruited from nazi persecutees thats also why you had multiple jewspeople with jewish heritage in high ranking east german positions but almost none in the west,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB2c1VSVXI3TnJ6S2dHQmZfR0dMSEJwdmNfVFI5alBubEVqWjUtNzBZVmJyZFZjUElVRHJJV3c0bVBORFJvUnU2X0k3WUZ6ZXQ0VFE4YXpsZ3E2UlZpbXc9PQ==
> they didnt make a distinction between someone being trans bisexual or even just into crossdressing they were just tried as homosexuals thats not true you were tried as a homosexual specifically if you were a preoperational trans woman who had sexual relations with men in that time transness was mostly diagnosed as a type of intersex disorder and hirschfeld also saw homosexuality as a type of intersexuality but they were aware of distinctions between the groups hirschfeld introduced a type of legal recognition of transgender people called transvestitenpass and while the usage definitely greatly decreased during the nazi era mostly because most of them were given out by hirschfelds institute which was majorly jewish there are multiple documented cases of people receiving them after the nazi takeover and the police respecting them another relatively high famous case was heinrich rathjen who was likely intersex heinrich was born as dora and competed for germany as a woman at the <number> olympics his intersex status became known in the late s and he was allowed to transition to male under nazi rule we also have naziera documents about the trans women who received sex change operations under hirschfeld in the s and as far as i know all of them were treated as fully female legally by the nazis also despite the fact that their transitions were widely reported in the newspapers at the time and none faced prosecution for being trans also unfun fact the doctor who performed the first known vaginoplasty later performed forced medical experiments on prisoners at the dachau concentration camp similarly cross dressing was technically illegal unless you had a transvestitenpass but in practice this was only enforced if it was in a homosexual context for example wehrmacht soldiers actually took photos of themselves cross dressing relatively often<url>,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB2Qkx0SS04RlQ2VHdDbmRyNmo5Rkl5ODRGclJPSWt2WXk0cGI1T2pZM0dPN3U3aUd1TWtxT0pLZGlpOWVzSmZMNmlFNGd6bW1NUFBzUlkxbmxaWkcxMHc9PQ==

uaengie i was going to say by how do we define most important maybe an otherwise meaningless battle had a strategic consequence based on even a small detail example carrhae how important was it really and was it important or not in the context of roman parthian relations ok but was its real important the simple fact that the roman defeat there included the death of the crassus broke the triumvirate setting up the civil war between caesar and pompey better yet saw an interesting take recently that conventional wisdom tends to write of the naval battle of jutland as unimportant it wasnt a decisive battle both sides took losses but neither side sustained game changing military breaking losses no major tactical objectives were achieved hell people can barely even agree on which side won but as an alternate interpretation pointed out the ability of the british to blockade germany was hugely impactful to wwi and the for the sake of argument lets say stalemate at jutland makes it clear to the germans that challenging the british navy was not a viable option ended any idea of breaking the blockade by force probably factored in pushing the germans to resort to unrestricted submarine warfare which obviously had its own unwelcome consequences for them,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAwUmhmZ0ROOHhYZFR5VGhzZmM4ZmxGelM4dmFsR3FtQWtvLTJnU2t6UDZCaTZQc3lvVVlGQnVZRWk3Ry1XNEVqVkNSWmIyaVNlUU9fV1dyR0ttNnM3T3c9PQ==

depends on which parts of the subcontinent by the time the battle of plassey took place the mughal empire was basically a puppet the muslim durrani empire and predominantly hindu maratha empire were still struggling over control of delhi the city that the mughal empire used as their capital when the power vacuum continued it was temporarily filled by the sikh empire under maharaja ranjit singh its very difficult to answer counterfactuals in history any question that involves if x had not happened then z would havewould not have happened though most histories ive read suggest that the mughals declined after emperor akbar was murdered and instead of continuing his policy of religious tolerance his successors decided to antagonize their nonmuslim subjects by doubling down on religious supremacism and pissed away the empires treasury on wars of conquest its plausible that some regions of india would have stayed under the control of muslim sultans but again even without british military intervention there were signs that the central muslim power in india represented by the mughal empire was on the way out and being actively challenged by their former hindu and sikh subjects,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAwa1RGOEFwbzF2V1VRb2NaX3FXMndPeU9jZk5IZXYyYlMyZ29SQTZYTUNreWNnLVAzS3NNZmFzOHE4aDNjbXVabzgweWhUU3lpYV8wcTBxd1J1eExickE9PQ==

the deterioration is interesting but not unexpected its hard sometimes to tell students just why we lose so many ships from antiquity unless they sank in the perfect circumstances for example we know exactly where the battle of the aegates islands took place the naval battle which ended the first punic war the largest such underwater archaeology expedition however were not pulling up intact ships rather the caps of the rams the weapons coins and armour there is sometimes a bit of wood inside the ram cap itself but for the most part the ships are just gone being able to show that this happens to metal ships that sank not too long ago can help bring home the point of how much the sea and its creatures aid in breaking up wreckages on its floor,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAxcENZTFY4dGRBdDFmX2pMd1dEMHlrc2VjLV85TW91NlMzdkFfNkFfUFFOUWlOTWxnZkRNOEFNR2FrclhYM1Btdkw4VVhNdU5iZjUxSy1ORjN2OXdFc2c9PQ==

i apologizei didnt take the time to refresh myself properly and youre right akbar was not murdered according to a brief skim of the internet it seems he suspected his successor salim of trying to poison him but i concede that nothing ive found implies akbar was killed as for the comment about religious antagonism ive taken the time to look into it and i was thinking of emperor aurangzeb i wish i was able to go back and find the specific academic source but the general story i was told is that aurangzeb was highly preoccupied with conquestthough there appears to be ongoing debate amongst modern historians as to whether aurangzebs conquests actually sparked an economic crisis or to what extent he actually enforced muslim law over the nonmuslim religious communities in the mughal empire clearly my professors favored one side of the debate over the other aurangzeb did order the execution of sikh guru tegh bahadur though again sources conflict over the moral basis mughal sources accused guru tegh bahadur of banditry whereas sikh sources claim the guru was executed for refusing aurangzebs demands to give up the sikh faith indian history is in my opinion very unusual in terms of how much disagreement and debate there is over what events are connected by cause and effect or just coincidence its not a case of peerreviewed academics on one side vs ignorantbutnoisy tinfoil hatters on the other but deep divisions where groups of respected academics still cant reach a consensus on what caused what or why however specific times and sequences of events are things that historians can at least agree on most of the time ill at least stand by my earlier position while this is purely speculation the mughal empire had fallen heavily into disarray without direct involvement by the east india company dont get me wrong the battle of plassey was disastrous for the mughals but the mughals were on a losing streak long before that the rapid rise of both the maratha empiremaratha confederation and the vibrant but shortlived sikh empire in my opinion serve as evidence that the eic werent the only nonmuslim power capable of filling the power vacuum the mughals left behind,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAyOERmV1JoMjJKZXM3bzJuMkpBUkp0LUllVEEzNmJmWkJMWlNNMHlTVTRDRDg0aXB5R01fcUFPUDRwZ3UxLUc0dE5xbldiRE44QmhPak9LTnV4dzh1UlE9PQ==

not so much a question but more so just a comment on how life like and realistic rd was for me i grew in a ranching and farming family in a very rural area even though i am clearly not from s a lot of the game is very reminiscent of what modern experiences can be like mostly in the personalities of the characters arthur always reminded me of my grandpa and his death hit very close to home and hearing my grandpas stories and the history of my family rd was very personal to me because it felt like i could have been looking into a time my family actually experienced and to some extent is passed on today to their descendants if that makes any sense most americans will never be able to experience this type of thing but for me the game just reminded me of my family growing up i do want to say i loved the parts when you meet the photographer and the woman into paleontology i also lived all the location references on the map to real places,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAzU3pfS2lqdWstRXFWZVJ4MmNpYndUU3I3ZUFCR2FHWGhyVDdNZ0JIY3JlQTI1SjZwZWZ2OUtuZUtSZFN4S1QtUmgzZlJkT1RzZkkxdzVTbTQyTmFTVE5tbHE5M2E0NzN4WkZvSzdtVkZuRzA9

just to respond to the last part of the question the decision to switch from the raf airfields to bombing london was made by goering and wasnt something forced by the british for context prior to this theyd been an accidental hit on london by a lost german bomber which provoked a very small tit for tat raid on berlin that caused nothing in the way of damage but this wasnt the main driver behind his decision a constant overestimate by luftwaffe pilots over how many planes they had shot down had convinced the germans that the raf couldnt have many more planes left yet time was running out for an invasion as the weather would get too bad in october and the germans still hadnt gained the needed air superiority in the south of england for the invasion to go ahead goering believed that if he launched bombing raids on london the raf would have to come out and fight as opposed to husbanding their resources which they had been doing all summer and his fighters could then clean up thus clearing the skies for the invasion to go ahead of course this didnt quite turn out how the germans expected with the invasion no longer an option until spring the germans opted for strategic night bombing attacking british cities across the country from september <number> to march <number> in the hope that the british would sue for peace the indiscriminate results of which so delighted the germans they actually invented a new verb following the attack on coventry coventrieren to devastate a city by bombing shirer covers this quite well in his rise and fall of the third reich so social media is incorrect bomber command did not attack first indeed prior to the summer of <number> it had mainly been dropping leaflets over germany laying mines or attacking shipping the only instance prior to postblitz that i am aware of and could be regarded as a british strategic bombing attack was a small force that attacked some oil plants following the bombing of rotterdam in may <number> as sir arthur harris said the nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everyone else and nobody was going to bomb them at rotterdam london warsaw and half a hundred other places they put their rather naive theory into operation they sowed the wind and now they are going to reap the whirlwind,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FiTDF4MEo1UXBfWjctQ0twR0w3TnNyQkNQaHpoVzRSRGVKaklwVTNFX3VOT1dXSENfWnRIdi1HUHZOSDJkZHAzaGZsRDdpTUNiUFhJVTh5dFVSbG9KNlR6UzZJYjlUelJfNEhjdG05bU9nMnc9

i had the opportunity to attend a wonderful lecture by one of the first research groups to challenge the collapse story about the island it was really impressive how much meticulous work they had done to dig into diamonds various claims including some seriously impressive work on how the heads were carved and some really great forensive anthropology on the question of why one of the points they made was that it is pretty tenuous to only look at authoritative written textual sources to determine first european contact with the islands population since it was a pretty widely accepted fact that european civilian ships would often not log every single landfall or necessarily provide clear indications of where they had landed diamond essentially argued that since there was no european contact until x year clearly the population must have collapsed of its own accord prior to that but that only works if you assume that the only contact was recorded in unambiguous written textual sources if you question that dubious assumption then it is entirely possible and even likely that earlier contact and therefore disease transmission was the main cause of population collapse,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FlYl96NlhqbDZENTdhYUF5Yk81TmlDdjR5SlV3ZkQ3LUpqcmxtTE5iSDlpaE1mVkxycG1qbkl3NlhoUElFTjFmbjZCZDBTRHd5MmVNYWRSaHRsR1lyOHc9PQ==

the word corn is related to kernel you can see the connection in that first syllable if you come across the word corn in a pre th century context outside of the americas its almost always going to be referring to a cereal grain in the context of an individual seed the word corn was slapped onto pepper in that same type of use a peppercorn is an individual seed of pepper im not sure how corn came to lose that context and just be applied to maize but im guessing the foreignness of the word and the difficulty english speakers have pronouncing the two vowels back to back made corn seem easier,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FleHFzdDNnT3VaSm9nZUhBUTJGc2dkUU1VVmpQSVppOFAyQ0J3YWpsRTJZdmFVNlpzeC1ib1hHSDVxalB1X0F3dE00NDFjWkJ4TXd3QlNjYUJ3QUU2SWc9PQ==

yes starting around the th century the reason british sailors are called limeys is bc of the limes they carried on board to reduce scurvy in the th century british sailors had a specific lime ration on their trips bc of this roses lime juice was invented for this and its still available at most grocery stores for making gimlets the link between fresh fruit and scurvy was known in the th century but it wasnt really a big problem until people really started sailing long distances in the th century the spanish and portuguese recommended carrying citrus bc of its effectiveness the actual mechanism of scurvy wasnt discovered until the s stephen brown has a great book on the history of scurvy and talks about some of the issues like when lime juice is exposed to light the chemical hexuronic acid that combats scurvy breaks down so people would drink lime juice and it wouldnt always work which made fresh fruit uncertain as a cure his book is just called scurvy <url> the new david grann book the wager details the shipwreck of the wager in the s and they experience scurvy on that trip its a great book and worth reading for a bunch of reasons but if youre interested in scurvy its a good jumping off point,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3Flc1RIMHVMTXhCM1M5TFdmRnpIcVhhWGJ0VUVwQ2Q4aUJtX3J4ZVQ0NVhJbDlvS1hzbWx4R29adnh2R2Fjdm94cEQxb1JGQjlHb19VNEt5OGNzRzJ6Umc9PQ==

well its speculated that the original maoi statues were full bodies rather than just heads and that each one was carved to serve as the vessel for the spirits of their dead so that they may live on as gods and use their power to protect the island from ill fortune the only reason we see the heads that remain today is because they were in transit from the quarries to their final destinations and left in place once things started turning bad the completed statues out by the coast were systematically destroyed by the islanders themselves after the first europeans arrived caused a ruckus killed a few people and left behind a disease that ripped through their population they no longer believed that their gods truly protected them if their giant stone guardians were nothing more than the rocks they were carved from then their ancestors spirits never inhabited them their entire concept of afterlife and the existence of divinity was called into question and when the community is already as isolated as it was what do you do when the whole island suffers an existential crisis,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FlZVNQVE5YMlQzVnp3UGZQVVhNM2VxU0NhZ3VMN3NfclgzVHAxbk9ZNlUxa3k1cmpjS1J5UVNuVDgzNHBfdXFJbU5sTzFRQTZtek1tQTMzcU90MVlDQ2c9PQ==

the opposite turns out more to have been the norm even in the late age of sail it was still common to encounter fragmentary or imprecise information about various geographic discoveries in the written record european navigators would find themselves trying to locate islands or retrace a past landfall by piecing together different documents parts of letters or journal accounts or trying to make sense of rumors and legends that had been transmitted orally by sailors without much consistency do the accounts of avery adams and of bartolomeo banderas both actually refer to the same island and is that the island i am looking at right now out on the horizon that kind of thing meaning that the existence of such fragmentary information was quite typical and not at all a strange or unusual occurrence it is somewhat odd to have glibly decided that it was impossible a priori in this case but then the entire history of pacific island studies generally is full of weird a priori dismissals,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FqZVRzcGo1eksycEJIZ0d3bTFrME4wVHRUem1zSWFsSHJ2b3B1UnVGTk9tYXEwT1JLUzlBZ2YzQzVQUXpWM0pwcllIVlhDbTE5X3RrcGhjR2RNMm9qa0E9PQ==

im from a particular family that for various reasons ill not get into maintains certain documents and records and other items a family bible with the entire genealogy written in the back through present times that goes back about a thousand years for example which i keep telling my cousin belongs in a particular museum in a climate controlled environment as simply the historical and cultural value to a certain country marked it priceless but again id prefer to not get into details and trace much of our lineage and titles going back an exceptionally long time i even wear our family signet ring with the family crest which was used back in the day as evidentiary proof as there was a time when sealing wax with the crest pressed into it was proof of provenance and is older than the us which my son will receive when i pass as i did from my father so for numerous reasons some probably egodriven but some legitimate legal and other reasons i wont discuss we have extensive records we keep and the european class system was very important for a very long time and its not that unusual for someone to be a descendant of famous historical people kingsqueens etc but they just dont know it so its not as special as it may sound and much of the documents and items are kept in secure locations as well so its not a situation where i can open a drawer and show someone something of historical significance but i do have some interesting items at home that i enjoy merely having ill admit but with all of this comes some to me serious downsides as i dont like the classist system that the world still enforced knowingly and unknowingly and some of my family i dont even have anything to do with after severing ties as they think that having money and titles makes them better than other people and that tribalismclassism is absurd to me,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOVFZZ19UYTNtaGFaTmJtZnRzVVczR2RVWldxN0JoN1BfTkk0eEQyTENqZ3dpSjItX3NsS0dteE51MnBfOWhpYklGMEtKUmJ2d1hXUTVRS3RBZllSTkE9PQ==

nineteen directly around <number> if including people who werent technically executed but died as a result the trials in salem was a fairly isolated and short incident a little over a year long but you may be associating it with wider witch trials which thousands died as a result of salem just happens to be one of the more wider known ones mainly due to popular culture you may also be confusing it with the inquisition which included executions for witchcraft but that also was a lot less violent than in popular imagination theres a great book about that in particular but its escaping my memory at the moment so ill have to dig through some old files to see if i can find it if youre interested,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndE9QZWtmOFhoRGJ6NjJlUUZIYlFRbjBhSHpSUkMzWC15aHRTRU1vUVV3YlBBQk5UcF9QVnh3Sngya0tDbXNhNzF3czc1MktkYWtyQTc1Y0tHdzFUNlE9PQ==

i dont really know that the article proves its point ive seen most of these before and heres the thing the bow was already being phased out when many of the sources this article cites are mentioned those at the beginning that is a few sources arguing for the bow arent really all that meaningful in wwii there was a significant debate about how best to battle massed tank formations deployed guns vs selfpropelled guns the us army heavily favored deployed at first but selfpropelled guns won out if you just randomly cited lesley mcnair you might think the opposite but just because mcnair favored deployed guns and made sensible sounding arguments in their favor does not mean selfpropelled guns didnt win that doctrinal debate same thing with the us armys latter debated on battle rifles vs semiautomatic rifles many favored the former well past the point it just didnt make sense their arguments werent random or incoherent but they were nonetheless not born out by the reality of experience at the time id also point out in the premise theres a bit of a switcheroo the oft opinioned internet wisdom is that guns took less time to train you could call that easier but thats not an argument that muskets took off because you could hand them to a mob and get results this is also the point the article spends no real time debunking it quotes a single person who i can immediately point out is not doing a very good job separating topics the professionalization of military forces in europe goes hand in hand with the adoption of gun but the costs of professionalization should not be confused with the costs of arms training nor does one strictly bear on the other the article kind of glosses over its own problem in this regard untrained bands of bowmen and such in countries were weekend training on your own time was a norm vs the states adoption of a more direct hand in training professional troops that they didnt have to train the former directly would seem to be a consequence of the very laws the article brings up not the debunking point it tries to make per se the op article never actually argues this point instead it focuses on the economics of training and whether or not training was important at all which isnt the argument people repeat ie the article first declares an argument is false but then argues against a strawman instead the article then proceeds to make economic arguments that i dont think pan out at least they dont vibe with what ive read so im skeptical of the contextless numbers provided to argue against the strawman argument that isnt the argument the article proclaims to be debunking this article is a bit too fast and loose and cherry picked to really convince me the conventional wisdom is wrong id also point out <number> citations at the end is not tons of sources of the three only one looks scholarly and its contents arent directly addressed also i swear i saw this exact post like <number> months ago on raskhistorians almost word for word technically they both lost because tactics around tanks and antitank warfare took unforeseen turns in the late s and early s,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYXVzRUdzMmtBTHB6VVJHNXk3RHVtRDhTQ18yV0ZObUw1Q3hzcGRzdHN2TFlVUEpEaVBqbWxiNnJnSlFzSWZFczlQcnJnQWlob0lXbEFYdkZMNWNIN1E9PQ==
so the article compares well drilled pike and shot formations with archers that received no training for mass combat and claims that the musket harder to learn than the bow but thats not what youre comparing at all thats like saying that modern rifles are harder to learn to use than bows because its really expensive and difficult to train soldiers effective in combined arms operations learning how to use the weapon and learning how to fight in a formation on the battlefield have very little to do with one another,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTUZ4ZDAxckNHaG41cTdVMmQ4M3hnVDQ3WWQxSGM0cDdxWmMyN09nRi1YSmtwT2JmSmJzYXNaNUdkS2hqcEZ2RU9ocDJZM2JOakxJcDdvRmFoMlpaQVE9PQ==
its more likely the reason th century englishmen didnt mention that it was easier to train men in firearms than bows was because every bowman came to the army pretrained from the perspective of military men it was harder to train arquebusiers because they were starting from scratch whereas the archers already knew what they were doing but that doesnt mean the overall training required wasnt greater for archers any idiot could shoot a light hunting bow or crossbow but to shoot a proper longbow took not just training for accuracy but decades of building up the right muscle groups still i think the overall point of the article is right ease of training wasnt a major factor in the adoption of firearms the fact that mandatory longbow training continued to be enforced in england shows they werent having difficulty finding trained archers firearms just offered more advantages on the battlefield,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnb2hJYlB4ay03MndhTnJtMHVPam54OU5wd05GMGh4aW1vOXJMenN0ZWZRZllaTGw1ZzAxaThJWkEyYUVtY2Z2cTZWaHFWSzVJMU44U0J3eExEcTNwRlE9PQ==

point of correction but only for accuracy such that others can do their own research not trying to be a jerk but its battle rifles versus assault rifles most battle rifles are restricted to semiautomatic operation due to the intense stacking recoil of automatic fire whereas assault rifles are reduced in power to make automatic shoulder fire manageable semiautomatic just means the gun loads the next round by itself and there are plenty of semiautos that are so weak that a military application would be laughable,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRm1EaDFmd3B5NF8tdUdESFlWMXk0WDEzUXk2amk2Y0FjTURHRUNDRmJWVTRkZVBPbi1qZmstX3dGYmxQMmJVMWk2alN1QXdha2JHbzJRWWpVdHdwaWRzS3hkelc3dWRWRUVuSnh0c0xiU3M9

the article is quoting the lived experience of men who took both archers and gunmen to war not the op and not the website author im not seeing why the experience of period military veterans is so casually dismissed in favor of hobby archer theories yes i know that victorian era hobby archers were rich guys who were very important making statements about things they didnt really know about how their hobby arrows were more deadly than bullets but their blather was no more accurate than elon musks and to me carrying a fuse thats on fire while putting gun powder into a long clumsy heavy gun in two different places followed by putting heavy round ball in place without missing a step dropping something or blowing yourself up seems pretty complicated and dangerous shooting guns is relatively easier now after centuries of development it wasnt easy back then even more so if it has to be done in clouds of smoke while people are trying to kill you,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNmpDcjlWTXZnNXR4a1lQRlVINjluYWtOWDNPNEFXUS00bmgzajB4c2FzS1FBVGJOQkVwRzRHMnJBTGVEcFdyMnltVXRFWWQtNnlYOHJxVnZKLTJRNXc9PQ==

>the oft opinioned internet wisdom is that guns took less time to train you could call that easier but thats not an argument that muskets took off because you could hand them to a mob and get results except that is exactly what i see online arguments imply for the adoption of firearms that you could give a crossbow or gun to a mob that is the oft repeated internet wisdom as to why firearms were adopted but any way you dice this argument its presupposition is that firearms became popular because you could hand them to green troops and have them perform adequately what we in fact see is firearms popularized in use by long term highly paid career soldiers with crossbowmen fitting often into the same mold especially as mercenaries far from the weapon of rapidly trained up green troops they are in fact some of the most veteran and highest paid troops out on the battlefield before guns filter on down the ranks of course if you look into it its not surprising just look at the associated costs of making a crossbow or gun and maintaining ammunition yet despite how much more complex building long iron barrels or even just sourcing raw ingredients let alone producing gunpowder was than bows and arrows guns eventually became so baseline that states were willing to pay those exorbitant costs even for green troops and just barely train them on firing those weaponsthree shots a year before they would stoop to giving them bows,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnenVvaVgzZ1V5dFhRQWJIbjROMVgzaHloWWFIUVBFNmhzUjNpbjVseUYyMUtXU1dGTWItUWFlWEFqQ1luWVVkX1NQaWxWSThpSUE0dGxxa1l2MGNZS0E9PQ==

the article is saying that musketeers were not easier to train than archers from the pov of the states of the period that was correct yes maybe training archers to the same level would have been harder but the historical truth is that states spent a lot more training musketeers than archers so as the article says in the first lines musketeers werent adopted because of training time or to use your example today states dont use assualt rifles because they are easier to train than bows they in fact spend a lot more training their soldiers than medieval states did for their archers,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM3B0cktUQ0Q1UWRhVGVicl9CUzBtOWQ0NVNuWWxBNmNaREVZa0VweklEUDN0Rk1GTGNVMjc5R0NzakFPTm5BVUlwdGFtTDZSaXgtT2pfT19saWRUTFE9PQ==

i have literally never seen anyone present it that way and if to point out again your conflating the costs if professionalization with arms training the argument ive seen not on the internet mind is that the centralization of state power plus emerging industrialization pushed the emerging western european states toward guns because guns were easily streamlined their logistics came out to be more affordable long term the expense of metal and powder was made up in the ease of mass production and transport standardization in troops saved costs the state doing all of this itself gave power to the central authorities and diminished their reliance on vassals and lords for military support all of that is a way more complex argument but under it is the same addage guns cane out cheaper and their training to an adequate level was less time consuming than other arms which furthered the more complex changes that went hand in hand with their adoption,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZzRnemhkVEdYQzdjblYtVlNnWjBUd0JEVm1SY0l3Q1Z4eTd2Vi1HMUNPVDdzRzZLMTA5ME5jTkxmRzJmdFQ1REYwNUJEWVFmTGItYkdVMWlQSE1OUGc9PQ==

the sources in the article dont actually claim that they largely dont speak to the broader argument at all and are too cherry picked to be particularly convincing like im open to alternatives what i know about this in europe does not jive with what i know about the adoption of guns in japan in japan what we see is very early on that that comparatively small forces of gunners had disproportionately outsized effects on the outcomes of battles at nagashino gunners were a fraction of nobunagas force but aside from some mythologizing of his victory no source contemporary or post disputes that his proper employment of firearms was what won him the battle he had an army of at least <number> men only <number> of them were armed with guns but those <number> men were given most of the credit for winning but i also think the argument there has little to do with the merits of guns vs bows on the field than the way nobunaga used guns to bring a section of his force under more direct authority,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVWRVRDRsRmZoSzd6dDMyMV9SaklQVjZtU2pxdGRhbUlFLWtRdUwzNlBBSDZWeFNvWlNycEEzSDhLcmxPckZyZ3FYbkszcmlTSmNNc3dXY0ZSZF9rNGc9PQ==

its not about the training as in how to coordinate your formations its about the strength needed to shoot a heavy warbow that required men in good shape who regularly shot in the bow yes thats how you say it that came from practice not necessarily on the drilling grounds but at the butts for short range shooting and by shooting at the clout<url> for longer distance shooting now there is one way in which this is correct you can teach a man in any sort of reasonable shape to be an effective military archer with a bow of say <number> to <number> lbs draw weight in the same amount of time it takes to train a musketeer this is however only effective against an unarmored opponent if your opponents are wearing armor or a significant number of them are then the physics dictates you need a heavy arrow which means you need a heavy draw weight over <number> lbs and even as high as <number> to <number> lbs benjamin franklin proposed during the american revolution that the patriots should raise and train a corps of archers and i think that would have been a pretty effective unit making bows and arrows is much easier and less expensive than making a musket or rifle the british and german troops were unarmored and wouldnt be able to get effective armor due to cost and shipping issues so bows in the <number> to <number> lb draw weight range would have been good enough these archers could have opened up a galling fire upon their opponents at <number> yards much farther than the effective range of a musket i once did the math and the english army of <number> would have handily wiped the field of the british army of <number> because the later army would lose a significant amount of men before they even got into a position to return fire and the higher rate of fire of the bowmen would have made mincemeat of the musket armed troops at normal musketry ranges musket armed troops only all bets are off against colonel coote manninghams experimental corps of riflemen later to become the th rifles the reason is obvious rifle armed troops trained to engage distant targets despite their slower reload rate could outrange longbow armed troops there is a good possibility to hit individual human sized targets at <number>+ yards with a baker rifle with a longbow youre shooting at an area target a mass of men at that distance,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUoybFNDLS16QXZPVTVIZEpFN0kyb1VnbnNrSVNhekFxRExJVlVxV255cDJjejYzdFRHcE1JOW9mZHgtRUZaUnd1RlZPdUNUNk5GcnpqcVdfbVhFX3c9PQ==

speed is not important per se impact power is try to penetrate anything with your fs arrows here you can read about typical draw power and other aspects of using bows <url><url> built differently doesnt substitute power you still need enough energy to produce harm archery primarily was the hardcore physical work which required physically fit well trained individuals fire arms required primarily discipline and no you dont need quality clue quality steel etc you need hardened iron rapier points most of the european countries knew how to make them blunt points including there are plenty of historical examples of them and the ammunition being of course ever ongoing logistics problem was never the reason for abandoning bows by the military i remind that they transited to more complex to produce maintain and supply fire arms especially gun powder was a nightmare to produce transport stock and supply use simplicity and logistically achievable mass scale was the reason for this transition another reason was legislative death of free hunting which reduced bow proficiency and bow use ubiquity in rural population,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoeFc2MXkzb0ZzUnEyRkJCdkFmZmtRX0tkOUxtQXVOOHFGU2ZkUnpJdmRpTll5TjUwUGdidFJidVdkb012UkpQUU8tS01HbG1nd0o1Q3hNREdnSkVqRlE9PQ==

i believe high draw weight was for those who could do it as a sign of respect you know how much do you lift bro and those very high poundage bows were huge minority bow can only push the arrow as fast as its limbs move the benefit of draw weight in longbows is that such bows are slow so they try to compensate with arrow weight longbow pushes lighter average and heavier arrow at about same speed because its limited by slow limbs bows also have diminishing returns if you thicken the limb to much they became slower and the top speed they get goes down and longbows have huge disadvantage here because they are long and long limbs means more heavy more inertia to overcome from the start dont hold me on my word but i think all flight bows bows that compete for distance are light like <number> pound craftily made horsebows and very light arrows and if we get into modern compounds with pulleys draw weight is low yet its faster than any traditional bow you really dont understand impact it is mostly about speed unless weight is too low but average arrow travelling fast has more penetration then heavier arrow travelling slow look for instance shotgun slugs very heavy lead bullet yet it hes trouble penetrating modern vests because its slow while rifle has much smaller and faster bullet and goes true,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoRFRQQklsdE9GdGxsNDJwX0pVbmRKYTdCc2tQdnRFLTV6YTY4MVBuSWZiWVNYYzR4OVZ4X2dBMWd2d2J4SXV5WXdFNjVEd04zWlRCV1FRaFFDSjlzNXc9PQ==

hey i dont know where to question this so i am sending it here when looking at the history of the s i often ask myself why didnt weimar germany just send all its inflated money to the allies as reperations when they reformed their money to the new marks during the golden era of the s to s like did they just ignore they had that money after sure its inflated but it couldve equaled to a few million at least like a <number> to <number> of the reparation payed which is better than nothing ig editnutshell why didnt the germans during the s or so just use their old money to pay for the reparations,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoVFVhM2dta0lLeFB2aWU2VWVTV2FjempoSXQ0clJUNnJBSGVNZDMzRkJqR191ZW1oZW5OOU5IVTd0V3QzM3JwUmRRa0IwenhKSzBWU2VlcWxLOUZKWGc9PQ==
youre missing the point of my comment i dont know or care which is easier to train with there is a broad idea that muskets are easier to train with this article claims that it is a myth that muskets are easier to train and then compares an entire military training regiment that is largely comprised on nonweapons training it has almost nothing to do with the overall claim,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoekxLZmp4YWpSWXBIMVd2dVRrRHczamVHM1JXV0ZfSy1yWGI3Vmdsdm53a0lCZTlOakpXYktMZm9NamJxQVNFZndFbjRycTNuT28wUmphX21RZ0tpU0E9PQ==

and just like the article this has a ton of conflicting points how can it be easier if you acknowledge it takes time and effort to build yourself to that its also to add that firing a lb modern bow at probably <number> yds is not at all the same as firing a sightless lb longbow at <number> yds the point is that firearms were easier to train troops with because you could take someone with literally <number> experience and train them in a few weeks as opposed to having to pick from available archers because it takes years to practice its why england had mandatory archery practice every sunday starting in the late th century,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoclRYV2lUTGFYbGtqMlcwOUNxYW1fZnVZbUhMMHJ4NWZGZUdOZno2b3ZCMWhfU056WHI4ck1XY0w5cTdXM09sQldQeGVfcEVEM192RTVkSTBlSlN0aVJJZGhxbG9qTENXZnFxV2NUZzItbDg9
all you write is right and the article isnt that convincing but the whole archers vs musket discussion is anyhow freaking useless since the musket replaced the crossbow in most of europe and not the bow the ottoman empire and the english used massed bow formations but most armies in the th and th century used also a lot of crossbows due to the ease of use and penetration power so same reasons as the musket,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoME1tMDBiS3poMWt4dG9WZG1YUm9obEdBVHZrWllPT3MzMEFGc2RPaXhoQk5STWpmd192cWJMWk9FU2x5WDdRSjZPSzNIcmx1bGpsSkJpQlBjcXVoZHc9PQ==
hardened steel plate armor in the mid late th century seemed to have indeed by basically impervious to even the heaviest longbows but there is also the debate on how effective early fire arms were against such well made armor what did stop heavy cavalry and infantry in bough were pike formations in the end maybe it was the evolution towards larger and more cheaply equipped armies that made the difference and the musket so attractive musketeers and pistols were surely easier to use in masses mixed together with large pikemen hordes,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoQlNWd09HeXJvV2daaVNxOFFnNDZ5cmRaZlJqcFpTV2NJZ2NQYXdmcVVzeHU0U0p0dXM1T3ZlX1ZBUy1fZ3hrajZXOVZlOUFuQVlUUnllbUJ3SjZUVkE9PQ==

i think were agreeing here as proofed armor was very popular in the midlate th with some armors displaying the dent where the armor was proven against archers crossbows and later pistol and arquebus i probably wrote it improperly before and for that i apologize i meant it to state that armor technology was at first foiled by harder hitting gonne but armor eveloped to keep up until it was no longer possibleeconomical it definitely was modernization and uniformity that caused the musket to reach wider adoption and i would state pike as well standardized troops i feel is more of an eventuality in larger empires as irregular distribution of force or irregular combat capability means that your capability to keep what you have as a ruler much more difficult better to train up a force that can be relatively easily trained drilled to follow orders first and think second and can take any farmboy fresh out of his village to turn into a hardened line infantryman,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoR2RUMmFYcHBjYkhldHBwa2lmZW5WQzFHR2cxUDVDd0ZVMmExa1hEd2xsZ1A3VkoxTlpJQzNIY01HQXgzVkZ3Ukg4V2s5OVczMHJoY2c4WGd4N1VMMXc9PQ==

hi as we hope you can appreciate the holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with while we dont want to curtail discussion we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit outright holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head as such the rhistory mods have created this brief overview it is not intended to stifle further discussion but simply lay out the basic incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way what was the holocaust the holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of <number><number> million european jews carried out systematically by nazi germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during world war ii some historians will also include the deaths of the roma communists mentally disabled and other groups targeted by nazi policies which brings the total number of deaths to <number><number> million debates about whether or not the holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred but this guy says otherwise unfortunately there is a small but vocal minority of persons who fall into the category of holocaust denial attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude impugn well proven facts or even claim that the holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened although they often selfstyle themselves as revisionists they are not correctly described by the title while revisionism is not inherently a dirty word actual revision to quote michael shermer entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events rarely complete denial of the events themselves and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the holocaust it is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in <number> or so you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject and that is the result of good revisionism but these changes which even can be quite large such as the reassessment of deaths at auschwitz from ~<number> million to ~<number> million are done within the bounds of respected academic study and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections there are still plenty of questions within holocaust studies that are debated by scholars and there may still be more out there for us to discover and revise but when it comes to the basic facts there is simply no valid argument against them so what are the basics beginning with their rise to power in the s the nazi party headed by adolf hitler implemented a series of antijewish policies within germany marginalizing jews within society more and more stripping them of their wealth livelihoods and their dignity with the invasion of poland in <number> the number of jews under nazi control reached into the millions and this number would again increase with the invasion of the soviet union in <number> shortly after the invasion of poland the germans started to confine the jewish population into squalid ghettos after several plans on how to rid europe of the jews that all proved unfeasible by the time of the invasion of the soviet union in <number> ideological antisemitism and pragmatic resources considerations lead to masskillings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the nazi leadership first only practiced in the ussr it was influential groups such as the ss and the administration of the general government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of europe and sometime at the end of <number> met with hitlers approval the early killings were carried out foremost by the einsatzgruppen paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the ss and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of jews communists and other undesirable elements in the wake of the german militarys advance in what is often termed the holocaust by bullet the einsatzgruppen with the assistance of the wehrmacht the sd the security police as well as local collaborators would kill roughly two million persons over half of them jews most killings were carried out with mass shootings but other methods such as gas vans intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day were utilized too by early <number> the final solution to the socalled jewish question was essentially finalized at the wannsee conference under the direction of reinhard heydrich where the plan to eliminate the jewish population of europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied poland was presented and met with approval construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall and mass extermination mostly as part of operation reinhard had began operation by spring of <number> roughly <number> million persons nearly all jewish men women and children were immediately gassed upon arrival at bezec sobibor and treblinka over the next two years when these reinhard camps were closed and razed more victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as chemno but most infamously at auschwitzbirkenau where slightly over <number> million persons mostly jews died under the plan set forth at wannsee exterminations were hardly limited to the jews of poland but rather jews from all over europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter although the victims of the reinhard camps were originally buried they would later be exhumed and cremated and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as auschwitz the camps there were two main types of camps run by nazi germany which is sometimes a source of confusion concentration camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the nazis shortly after taking power beginning with the construction of dachau in <number> political opponents of all type not just jews could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the prewar years and while conditions were often brutal and squalid and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly although concentration camps were later made part of the final solution their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers some were way stations and others were work camps where germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as extermination through labor jews and other undesirable elements if deemed healthy enough to work could find themselves spared for a time and allowed to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end although some concentration camps such as mauthausen did include small gas chambers mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp many camps becoming extremely overcrowded nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus or starvation all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent bergenbelsen which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count saw some <number> deaths caused by the conditions often located in the reich camps liberated by the western forces were exclusively concentration camps and many survivor testimonies come from these camps the concentration camps are contrasted with the extermination camps which were purpose built for mass killing with large gas chambers and later on crematoria but little or no facilities for inmates often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits such as at bezec where only seven jews forced to assist in operation of the camp were alive after the war several camps however were hybrids of both types the most famous being auschwitz which was vast a complex of subcamps the infamous selection of prisoners conducted by ss doctors upon arrival meant life or death with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve the death count at auschwitz numbered around <number> million but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies how do we know running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here but suffice to say there is a lot of evidence and not just the mountains of survivor testimony we have testimonies and writings from many who participated as well german documentation of the programs this site<url> catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass

>i have literally never seen anyone present it that way then you havent done much looking around >is that the centralization of state power plus emerging industrialization pushed the emerging western european states toward guns because guns were easily streamlined this flies in the face of mass adoption of firearms by groups that were notably not centralized and very much not industrialized not the least of which are native american tribes in the s who oft bemoaned being reliant on trade for firearms > the expense of metal and powder was made up in the ease of mass production and transport this frankly seems extremely dubious as a primary reason for firearm adoption i mean not the least of which by the time we get to line infantry in the early s they would in fact be adding additional supply chains as pikes and swords were converted to more musketeers hell europe didnt just randomly happen into craft producing firearms on such scale to equip entire armies the demand came first and the production substantially after such demand started nor did anybody else who began mass equipping armies with firearms >guns cane out cheaper and their training to an adequate level was less time consuming than other arms again this is pretty dam dubious that drilling pikemen was more complex than drilling matchlock musketeers whose weapons could explode or unexpectedly go off if handled wrong this all round about nonsense seems like its just trying to ignore the straight forward answer that in fact a big metal tube firearm held substantial benefit over other weapons that eventually militaries of all stripes prioritized them over basically all other arms just to compete again just consider the many many native american tribes that went through the extreme trouble and supply issues firearms and only fell back on bows and arrows they could actually supply themselves when they needed to,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpbnhqZHRnamEwWHBiakh4ekMxZGdVU3UtLTM1WFJRV3h4Z0NDQ3p2UkJYR2dUekRseDN3a0VjUjUyVjdHVlJ5dEo0N3hQNXF5R0RncHFLRlg4dnFBekE9PQ==

hey im curious about illegitimate children through history how was it that socalled bastards and illegitimate heirs were not simply denied by their fathers like if there is no dna testing couldnt a man of statuswealth simply say a child was not his as i understand it and could be wrong it seems like children were sometimes acknowledged but not officially accepted why acknowledge them at all i hope my question makes sense im really keen to understand better edit missed the word not in the first sentence,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpNjNDTFZZZ29DbDZfZ1I0ckFzV3NvWjdLN0lXbWR2WGl6N2lWMFRJVG1iVl91aFZKeHdPem0yS1RYSXE5TVp3eF9lbDcwb0xfVnhoNmRaNHVuTDVjTlE9PQ==
i mean basically yeah its going to depend a lot more on the culture the cultural norms and the laws though spartans may have practiced polyandry one woman multiple husbands which has been argued by pomeroy and i believe cartlidge to have allowed for younger men to father children but for all children to be raised by all of the male familial lines since no one could tell who was the father which gave the kid and the woman better social status in other cases though wanting to be sure it was your child was a factor and without any way to determine otherwise it was pretty easy for a denial to take precedence considering the male dominated nature of most societies then of course you bring in culturalreligious norms where bastard children might not be seen the same as others for example pericles of athens initiated a citizenship law that required future athenian citizens to have both male and female citizens for parents for them to gain the same this was controversial in its time among other athenians but it showed an awareness of this even in antiquity funnily enough pericles two legitimate sons died early so he was able to get his illegitimate son also named pericles who was not born to an athenian mother made a citizen despite the law that he had passed the younger pericles would later be executed but for unassociated reasons other than the fact that if he was not a citizen he couldnt have been in the position which led to his execution but thats a stretch but with other culturesreligions especially when you bring in children out of wedlock and the abrahamic associations theres another level of complication people want to present themselves in one way but people have always done things that arent perfect or that arent the way they hope to present themselves so theres both the social relationship you have with the state and society but the relationship you have with your family and your children as well these dont always align an extreme case of this later example might be strom thurmond thurmond was even in his own time a pretty big racist when he was <number> he had sex with a <number> year old black girl who worked for his family and she gave birth to his daughter he never spoke about it publicly during his life but supported her somewhat financially he had his social obligations his cultural obligations his financial obligations ie his job as a politician but also his familialsanguinis obligations and did recognise her as his daughter even if it would be very troublesome towards his other parts of his life if this was ever revealed as for why one might recognise but not fully acknowledge an heir it again might come down to culture and law this is particularly noteworthy in history when we look at rulerskingsemperors etc in systems where the person who replaces them is a son or daughter some of these require that person to be just like pericles law of both parents who both have a certain bloodline those who are born out of this compact might be acknowledged might be given other positions and supported and maybe even loved but they cannot be king or queen the same may be the case for inheritance these laws are largely archaic in modern terms though im sure inheritance lawyers would probably be able to discuss some difficulties that still exist but when we look at cultural norms and practices they can impact things even that the highest power in the country cant easily bypass eg the abdication of edward viii of the united kingdom who gave up the throne when it was clear he couldnt marry a divorcee without causing a significant problem he could absolutely have done it and told everyone to fuck off essentially but there was a cultural expectation and social expectation and he opted to not cause that disruption i hope ive helped instead of just rambling at you,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpQk5vTEFOOFQ2LUY1b1FvR3dvcWRialVCMVEzYjYzVjJmbnU3WmxsZ1hBSTE5ZWVqeXF2WFA5UjBCWGRxdnBISzA5Q25HS1ZON2wwRjlPZ1RnRnhfTXc9PQ==

if youre a king you probably had an arranged marriage depending on the marriage customs of your culture you may not be able to have additional wives or official concubines but lots of monarchs had unofficial mistresses children from those relationships would be illegitimate but the monarch might be happy to acknowledge them as children he had with someone he might actually like theres also things like persons in officially celibate occupations where they couldnt officially get married pope innocent viii had some of his childrens weddings held right in the vatican it really depended on the situation but in europe legitimacy was very important for inheritance purposes so they wanted to keep track but not necessarily completely disown illegitimate children it depended on the individuals and the customs in question im sure there were a lot of illegitimate children who were never acknowledged as well,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpVGVtWV9HMVpfekV2dGoyUkJQSUhhTEJZZkRmWUJLRlU2SmtTM1JQeGF2MlJtT2F3R1RuVTlCRExaMW1UVnBzVnVIN0FFaHd4ZGl3UlJ1bmZpcGk1dS1pUm1kQWJFZFd6Mi00S3pqd2MwaVk9

its true for rifles but not for muskets a ball from a musket aimed at the figure of a person will strike the ground a bit past <number> meters and musket armed troops were not trained to aim at distances by applying what we would today call kentucky elevation in fact a typical musket armed soldier might only fire half a dozen real shots during training and they were in fact told to aim low to counteract the tendency to aim over the heads of their opponents i was just looking at a table of some musketry tests done in austria with original muskets and using a target that was <number> tall and <number> wide at <number> meters<url> they hit the target an average of <number> of the time however its not actually a good test of practical accuracy in the field the guns were mounted on modern fixed frames to absorb recoil sighted on target ignited electrically bypassing their original firing mechanisms and their bullets were tracked and measured electronically had they pulled people off the street given them at most a couple hours training and conducted the test again that hit rate would have been much much lower perhaps as low as the single digits percentagewise maybe even zero which would square with this quote from colonel george hanger written in <number> a soldiers musket if not exceedingly illbored as many are will strike a figure of a man at <number> yards it may even at a hundred but a soldier must be very unfortunate indeed who shall be wounded by a common musket at <number> yards providing his antagonist aims at him and as to firing at a man at <number> yards with a common musket you may as well fire at the moon and have the same hope of hitting him i do maintain and will prove<cur>that no man was ever killed at <number> yards by a common musket by the person who aimed at him rifle armed troops are different they are trained to shoot at distant targets and their weapons are built to specifically allow for that the reason why guns replaced bows is that the armor got better to the point where even the most fit person couldnt draw a bow capable of piercing that armor guns dont require the upper body strength that bows require and increasing their armor penetration is a matter of increasing the velocity andor mass of the projectile because guns came into common use and their ability to penetrate even the best armor increased armor fell into disuse because it was heavy expensive and didnt protect like it did during the waning days of the warbow which ironically made bows a practical solution once again but militaries tend to be conservative they dont like radical change unless its forced upon them its said that every pissant regulation has been written in blood and while thats not <number> true there is a lot of truth to it the idea of going backwards technologically while it might occur to an outofthebox thinker like benjamin franklin and while it may have been a sound practical idea no military person is going to accept that because of training and often experience or in early rifle armed units they were professional hunters who brought their own weapons to use in military service and were familiar through long use how they shot at long range this is also why almost all military rifles didnt have bayonets until the baker rifle aside from the ferguson rifle and the rifles of the hessehanau freikorps no rifles had bayonets during the american revolution even purpose built military rifles like the,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpZXlFaFRRZ09zbEROX2h2ZGFVVFRKNUIya3VzYlBaVWhuVUM3X3YtM2tWd1NDOTk0azBfZ2pCYTBsbEZTaHE5TEJYbUFET3BzODQweURaZHpSaXNPQUE9PQ==

to me the greater cost saving is that archers can train for relatively cheap you can use the same arrows over and over and building the strength required doesnt even need a bow more over archers will also be using their skills for hunting even when not deployed musketry and artillery training both relied on much more concentrated state spending on the supplies and gunpowder and weapons require very specialized material processes it isnt any coincidence that countries with more industrial capacity to train musketeers and artillerymen were much more effective while other countries had to conserve these precious supplies to the point that their soliders were far less effective,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqNjIyUDFWN2dLYU9fWWdMZ3cxYks2dVl3aHE0bWp4b08zTzVpTldTdmw3RnMtdE82cTJRQzdfbGI0a2xEdDZhU19vSGVCa3RNSUc2c2VQckNCUmVWOFlEZzNZZHoxSnNTQlNIa1RGYnRTYUU9

last night i finished bismarcks war the francoprussian war and the making of modern europe by rachel chrastil <number><number> i rounded down on goodreads but that was a harsh decision its very good covers the military details well explains the political situation in detail and also provides a lot of info on the suffering of the civilian population the motivations of people involved the leaders soldiers and civilians are also presented in a very clear way the author tries to show the parts of the way the francoprussian war had similarities to the th century and the world wars mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of men the blurring of lines between civilian and military the devastation caused by new weaponry the author does a pretty good job at this theres a chapter dedicated the humanitarian intervention to ease the suffering of the civilian population as this didnt really happen much in earlier wars like the american civil war this is the first book ive read specifically about the francoprussian war one thing i found surprising was how at least in the early days of the war how close the battles were and how many casualties the germans took if the french leadership had been a bit more competent and aggressive things may have turned out differently when the war is mentioned in more general overview history books it is normally presented as the germans absoluting dominating france with ease its not a light read its about <number> pages and pretty much jumps straight into the action it doesnt provide that much in the way of background context so id only recommend it you already know a bit about european history the in s if you do want a book specifically about the francoprussian war id highly recommend it though next up havent started it yet vertigo the rise and fall of weimar germany by harald jahner as i want to continue clearing through my bought new german history books im also about halfway through berlin imagine a city by rory macclean as my commute read short chapters focused on specific people makes it easy to dip into which i have mixed feelings on,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqU2FJTzl4OHpQRXRDbGMyYjV4QnVjbzEtUjU5YTgwSW1aZlhFZGJnNU5xaF83NEVoT2locVI1R092bnFaeEFrNE10WEJ6enpOa3ZJR1R2NWtac1dqeVE9PQ==

>you can use the same arrows over and over maybe when training but in combat a lot of these arrows could be damaged when they hit armour or other hard surfaces arrows also take heck lot more effort and time to make than lead bullets as an amateur fletcher it takes me maybe an hour of cumulative time to turn a square pine shaft blank into a traditional fully fletched and tipped arrow and i didnt have to forge the arrowhead a master fletcher back then could probably do it in a fraction of the time but i doubt he would be faster than someone casting a big batch of lead round balls with a multicavity mold >building the strength required doesnt even need a bow as an amateur archer i also disagree with this statement drawing a bow uses a different set of muscles than saying lifting or carrying weights when i started i could barely pull back a <number> lb recurve bow despite having spent my college summers roofing where i regularly carried and tossed around <number><number> lb bundles of shingles for most folks you to have to practice with the bow to be good with a bow,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNrVWMxUUFRLUtXZHYyY2xrazYyaTBNZXlsQ1o0Tk1TNHpCX3YzV1pLSzZyRVdqOFQyQXpaVWRKTzhYU0RoU1ozLVl4WlFCWlBzb3FHUVRHRU9iV04wTE9wNTZRLXNlNmtwREVHTkkwaDRvWVE9

thats a strut a supporting structure as they carve the marble away struts are often in between gaps and are slowly filed down as they go if the artist decides that structure is needed even in the finished piece the strut will remain sometimes this is hidden and later art tended to try and hide it as best they could theres a reason theres a lot of stuff happening at the bottom of a lot of marble statues tree trunks snakes etc but this wouldnt have been a huge deal romans would later be very well known for leaving struts in but as this shows it was also a greek practice as well if you google struts roman art and struts greek art you can see more examples of this some hidden much better than others edit i should also note that its not uncommon to have struts digitally removed from statues in textbooks and museum guides,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNrcXFKcTl5ZktEcUJDQWlKMnVfdjQwSnpWaEpuSUFfNnM0dkR2TEVyYlQyM2g1NEFwdGw0anBuM2tfQzdjQ3VDQkdqa3ZmcXNiTHlKcVJZV3pnN012bGc9PQ==

that all sounds reasonable to me based on a cursory reading of history of these guilds men were expected to supply their own weapons and it appears to be the wealthiest men who were members that suggests to me at least that cost is still a factor here training a hundred shots for an archer might cost you a few broken arrows although you might be using practice arrows for precisely that so the cost of continual practice is relatively low training with a firearm is a constant and ongoing thing one presumes they are refusing lead but it still seems to me archery was still a much cheaper weapon to train on and in general much cheaper to deploy given that you could collect most arrows and heads too,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyVW56ZVNBWDNwY0lLeXFPWHNnaG5MNWRxTk5FMDdYWXZxaGNhYktMd0xVaGpZYTdtdGVkcEprYmxmWkQ1TFlUSWJaUWIxbkg1MEVHc1EtZHdueXJxOUNTb3B2SmdaeGhBaG9JUzM0YU02NEE9
i think the article is not very convincing as it does not take into full account the physical requirements to use a warbow effectively that is the time it takes to build up the strength to be able to use a bow effective for battle that is something that cannot be done in two weeks so while an individual could learn the insandouts of using the bow or the musket in a certain period of time that time could make him an effective shooter but not an effective bowman if he lacked the necessary muscle training a musketeer was easier in that sense because he would emerge in a state where he could use the weapon and function fully as a soldier if they had no prior experience the same is not true of an archer if they had not spent their life practicing the bow,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyUnlOUGN4RkFzNlFTbjBSRThnZVhIX256eHNLcFYySWowSmNwSUZzWk82eHRndUxpaGhEWDgxVGZreG5QUUw1OWpTX2M4ZzJFR0dXVkhyZ3lfdDJKZ0ZkcnpDOUFsMVk2cW03aUJ0cnFmbU09
your remark about hunting triggered this response one important factor in favor of the musket is that increasing population densities and deforestation made access to recruits with already existing basic fletching and hunting skills harder that would weigh in favor of lead bullets for longbows deforestation in itself was for certain a major issue poland the hre and england regulated the trade in yew wood because of it great bows were becoming very expensive ive seen a similar skills factor cited as the main consideration for the decision to motorize cavalry units after wwi access to rural conscripts with basic horse riding skills reduced while the number of urban conscripts with driving licenses and experience as mechanics was growing so with mass mobilization in mind it was a financially prudent move to motorize instead of massively scaling up horse riding education,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyR2s5SUY1Mzh0bEQwOVUtRVhsazZsdjViMGZUUzBMZFBVQXd5OThsVklVYnR3SlpSSU1FVEs0SFlyNkJQZVFtVzM0ME8wMTBuNnFKSHBUZEY0S1YzbENuSnF1RXpLcFRZWEZlQXJRNWdXekk9

its pretty much impossible for historians to measure terrible or incompetent we also have to consider bias if your father served and presumably emigrated he may harbour some less than pleasant memories of the soviets similar to how people in the us might view their politicians as terrible or incompetent based on not much youre also going to find a lot of propaganda against both sides due to the cold war and wanting to depict each other as negatively as possible but from a nonhistorical sense there have been a lot of people that were more or less generally considered bad at what they did in the us military too in fact i doubt you could find a state with enough evidence for its politics and politicians where you wouldnt find this so id be careful painting it as a place problem vs a politics problem or even a bias issue as one politicians incompetence can be read as a big plus by another especially in democratic societies,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0VXpGRENTSVAxNHQ1MVE0X3VPUGZSTEV0S253WjlWZlJGUTNCZWJWOGtXSjR6UDFVa2FfZzI3cjloVDA2SjgtNzh1SVhYaFZJZVpWcmRzXzFjUC1ubEE9PQ==

personally i would recommend choosing something you find interesting and reading a book about it or watch tv or movies or documentaries on that topic its a thousand times easier to learn about something you like than it is to try to learn all of history from nothing everything in history is connected to something else so as you start learning youll discover new topics to learn about what times or places or countries do you think are cool medieval europe ancient egypt greece china rome arabia the french revolution civil rights movement edoperiod japan pretty much any place language or people has thousands of years of history to choose as a place to start,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN1OGNEYkZoRjZSVzkzRGlHbTlUR1lBeFJfUzdKQWJRYmVzTDVRNVItSlhJOHNuYnNQYl9MVkR0ejFYei1UYmROWlRMVjhvQXB1c3NFYXBBTUNWMXBJaUE9PQ==

heres the full list of accusers<url> i didnt count but a majority seem to have womens names i really am curious though was my reasoning correct for why its still misogyny even ifwhen most perpetrators are women,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2dDl5OEhYbmFNSzVVdXNYUTdscFFNVHBydVZzcVVqdnJVSkFSa09rZUJQbmM3eENUN2MxME41NWs0bDZKVm1NSzdzTmRJZUdpR2tMczFxTVdBb2VlbkE9PQ==
again salem had <number> victims around <number> people have died due to witch accusations in recorded history <number> of those were women why do you think it is if it had nothing to do with them being women and why might you think that even women and girls might become accusers and why do they still predominantly accused other women,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2NWw2cjQtYzRnU3VnOTZ5dkxRaWk2Tkh4b2d4TjFXdzJXdm14RlZOREpVRV9ycXZMcDhwbWk4NmNaNUIzZFpTRXJKMkFmdEJidmF5MGdib2l4ZjBvNFE9PQ==
why are you unable to address my simple question i am not arguing that the vast majority of victims were not women ok you win the point nobody contested now please answer my question if a majority of the perpetrators were women why is the phenomenon still seen as misogynistic is it for the reason i suggested or not,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2TEFlcnZYVDMtM3N0OHJIU2dweS1xVU1rQXItVTJ4LUJUQ1h2OHNBYzBWT24yZ3c5eGxoTUYxaU8yRnZURi1RUm1PcnQyeVBuOWdMUWFSMm9RUnMtbVE9PQ==
i have addressed your question and im guiding you towards an understanding by perpetrators do you mean accusers jurors judges executioners and again part of the issue is because youre only looking at <number> of the victims which is <number> of all accusations which led to executions you are focusing on a ridiculous small portion and again why do you think women would accuse other women what does that tell us about societal issues what sort of society were women in salem living in what were their rights furthermore what motivations might they have for accusing others when people are going around accusing women,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2cmlQLTl5ZFluSm43WkRSZEJFbXN3VmFfX2F6VllzRndFekF1Q2phRjIxQUFmQmpUUFl3LXl3RHdHcEp5MVlQb241TVM2Z1REajJTTXQ0X2JYZ2U3d1E9PQ==
