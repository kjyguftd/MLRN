hello im terribly sorry to hear this happened to you there is help available and lots of people who have similar stories you are not alone trafficking doesnt have to have a component where the victim is paid in many cases the victim is never paid or given anything just used for the gain of the trafficker you dont need any proof persay of the fact you were trafficked in this case i would suspect it is possibly trafficking as they brought you to someone else for the purpose of sexual interaction and abuse some very strong indicators in what you described of trafficking please do ensure you keep reaching out for help i wish you the best in your journey,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TDBxZzZnR2hNRl9HT0ZaaUh1azZFTXd2bUJzdGNMOUR6WDI5VXg5LUwwNFo4RHZoVEt2ejN0QUlacFVvOC10N0lwMG9zYzdMbU5XUDYtZFVBLThCd2VSWTFqZGZDaHBfSS1hMTJVV3NTbFU9

many multiple years ago i was almost a victim of human trafficking luckily they caught not long after attempt w me while jogging to improve my running times for militaryphysical due to inherited health issue i didnt get in but within two years of that attempt of someone trying to kidnap and traffic me i became a life long advocate for antihuman trafficking and knowing the dangers and safety protocols to not be a victim of them or sexual predators in our own communities ive been a volunteer advocate and missing and murdered persons advocate for over <number> yrs please dont use the term as an endearing one much of the time these are not boyfriends never were they were and are simply those playing a role what they are called are predators and traffickers or scouts in a sense they lure groom and get young girls boys teens and adults women and even men to trust them buy them expensive items even meet family members do same w them get the family comfortable or lure the victims in by refusing meet family only seeing them when no one is around etc they then get the one targeted or try to leave their homes in middle of day or night or kidnap them from public places w barely anything check on your kids especially at night and late at night to make sure they are home safe and not having snuck out for what they believe may be a few mins or hours sometimes they are told not even change clothes by telling them oh dont worry i bought you stuff or we will go shopping in reality no necessities means its harder to leave w inadequate clothingshoes no money or way to contact anyone by the time they are put into any vehicle their rate of survival goes down from <number> survival rate to <number> immediately and if missing over three days even less of chance of being found alive it can take less than <number> mins w trafficking cells to get a victim and once theyve been taken it can be months years or decades until they are found alive if found alive once they have them in

since it appears you are using a phone to access the internet you can simply dial <number> to receive immediate helpeven without phone service this should still work and if youre not in a safe place to talk just mute your call volume and stay on the phone as long as possible without getting caught as they should be able to hear whats going on around you and track your location in real time if you have to end the call emergency services should still have your last known location make sure to have your ringtone volume on mute just in case they call back,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNRkt6QXBqUkJCVU1WOXNUYUh4aWhqdE5aNmdvdE96UTVzb043Qy13UzF6aHJfRFBqSldNeklRQUhIWDIyVHlsUFp2NlBBYkdVNXYzMmtaSWRzRXAtS3c9PQ==

im not going to lie when i was at the hotel the girls were mean probably a lot of projection and maybe they thought i was being trafficking since i was <number> and my aunt was <number> something at the time and felt intimidated to help its not easy with retailiation from the traffickers or them intimidating you or threatening you its better to just submit anonymous tips and hope the tips are good enough for investigation if you feel i guess strong enough that you can handle your personal safety threatened since you could be dealing with gang associations and stuff then you can help them like the way the cops would ive submitted an anonymous tip about trafficking before and even then they said it wasnt enough to do an investigation but they will keep my tip on file,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPU25fR1hNTmoxX3lCTHNHazBsSEdNdXdLVjVlTWNoTGpXcmxNMElmTGVmeXUwU1NHV0ZUMnI1QkRjcGppbGJtVTZrcjFLN18xSFpkeWhpWHZrd1BQOERnd2ZNeUtNNXlNOVM0ckpyWEFzSW89

this definitely seems like a red flag to me i think the best thing you can do for now is be there for your daughter expressing your concern as her mother is good but the last thing you want to do is push her away if you do she might run off with him and cut off all contact with you and then you really might not get her back has she made any sort of plan to get a job does she know where theyd be living anything,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQZGxNaGQzempTVEF1TXQ2WXVCOTFSWHFTeTV2cEFPQ2xTWVJ0VUx3ZVNqMGI3MUZwWHRIS3NQTmtEdUY3RFdTXzQxbS1KeVJJSG8waTUtUHNkdjVkVnRBWW9vUW1WSXNNYlpXYy03YnJnWXM9

theres the flip side to it too the grooming and denial of livelihood to manufacture ones desperation that leads them to say yes to the trafficker or shady situation that would turn into being trafficked are there stats on how many first responders police etc are johns when its reported to them their data isnt accurate because it wouldnt be in their best interest to out dysfunction on their side and they protect their own but like thats likely why this system thrivesincluding when they get calls about trafficking they send either the complicit or neutral officers to triage and see if they keep the victim or let them go like some sadistic catch and release wildlife program of nonconsentual sex workers how many traffickers themselves are employed directly by these government organizations how bad does it have to get before they help and why wont they help when people report the grooming process i shouldnt have to be forced to turn tricks before they help me otherwise theyre likely complicit in digital enjoyment of the abuse and dont want to lose their free captivity porn their lack of action is an action in itself what a screwed up system,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQWllrN2xHM05IMFAtT3U5RFE4c2FOdG5LX05UYzFYN2FZN2FvQ21lZHI0MlFEWTZYenYzcl9wM09ZN2phSUFmODBNcnNKLVhOUWpQMmlwazdBM0FUa1E9PQ==
