bullshit there are people born within our borders who are currently waving palestinian flags and chanting death to america if you are willing to look me in the eye and say that they are more american than a man who risked everything to bring his family here for a better life and was unwilling to wait for a broken immigration system and so crossed illegally but has otherwise obeyed the law worked hard and tried to assimilate if you honestly think that that asshole chanting death to america is more american than that migrant then you are an idiot and deserve to be punched in the teeth just for being so dumb so once again youd do well to actually listen this time american is not a nationality it is a perspective as far as i am concerned everyone who holds american values and wishes to be here already is an american in their heart and if we deported all those who are american on paper only and replaced them with those who cherish the values of our constitution then we would be x more powerful and prosperous than we have ever been,r/illegalimmigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPUFhrMU42Zzg2TlFjM0x1blIwQ3dydVJBX3NWblBZTUU2Z1A4Q0tEVUdNREktNnNrRjlJMUtvbmpzUmFVX3ctMkptUUJRRFN4R0NDekdWYmxlRjU2Rnc9PQ==

you got the borders are imaginary lines part right you got the other three wrong which reflects your lack of understanding mexican is a nationality french is a nationality bolivian is a nationality american is a perspective because america is exceptional what makes america unique is our view of freedom and how rights are granted by god and not gifted by government that should be our litmus test not all illegal immigrants have an american perspective we have seen many in the news they come here illegally then they commit rape or join protests and wave the flags of other nations those should be removed but the ones who come here value our freedoms are willing to fight and die to protect this nation and obey the law while standing right besides like minded citizens damn right i accept them as american no those protestors arent american because if given the chance they would happily strip the rest of us of those god given freedoms and not think that they were doing anything wrong they are paper americans or americans in name only because if you examine what they actually stand for they are rabidly antiamerican they hate what this nation stands for,r/illegalimmigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPcTkzM2hUY3ZBT1U5VGJJSHVTTHpDZTBSQmkyMG5NRzR1aFdFNTlQa2lzdnFlaWhmMDJmN0drWUlBS0I2NnFHZ3lscXJIc0NZRjhFQmJZUkNfTlNpaXc9PQ==
execpt that it is not so simple there are at least <number> million people here already who have crossed illegally and our immigration system itself is a broken mess how do you propose to find and remove those <number> million the think that would be simple or cheap it would make our failed drug war look like a grade school warm up before a professional match and the cost may as well accept aocs green new deal because one stupid decision deserves another id be curious to see which actually cost more in the end because it would be close and i think the green new deal has a better chance of actually working lol no you cant feasible remove that many people especially since they have been here for years and usually have kids born here and whom are already citizens under the current broken system it is not simple it is a quagmire to calling simple is to where rose colored glasses and to look as a mosaic from a great distance while ignoring the fact that the mosaic is made up of millions of smaller interconnected pictures in fine infinte detail should they have come legally yes just as you should drive the speed limit but i drive just a little bit over all the time and if i put myself in their place and i am waiting at the border and my family is suffering and i want nothing more than to be an american and to be free and for my family to prosper am i going to be content to sit at the border fuck no they dont belong here that may be the point on which you are most wrong of all i used to be like you i use to joke about buying the southern border and building a shooting range saying that the targets would present themselves but we cant stay young and dumb forever i think the tipping point came while watching and interview with an antifa member who insisted that his opposition should be shut down and not allowed to present their views when questioned about the their rights to free spech just repeated i dont carei dont care and i thought to myself you cant get much more unamerican than that i realized that the state of being american is not about where you are born it is about your values and what you believe if you believe in freedom as long as it doesnt infringe upon anothers rights or harm other people or property if you are willing to fight for those freedoms if you believe in a right to speech and religion and to bear arms to defend those rights then you are not a trespasser or a burglar you did not come to pillage or steal you are my brother and fellow and i welcome such like minded people to stand next to me shoulder to shoulder against all enemies foreign and domestic such people are american to the core regardless of where they are from,r/illegalimmigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPMWlLbXRZTzFBQmFCNEJRc1ZhaXk3bmR3VlY0MlViV08yWWtVMFdla2JNVXpsNkQyY2JpU3ZYQlVKeTk4bzBzenZtbXhBSk9abE9ac2lqODBTZWNxU2c9PQ==
