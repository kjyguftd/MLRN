there is probably a record of the asylm request declaration i believe the procedure on entry to canada via irregular means is to present yourself at the local police station and request asylum that gets the ball rolling there should be documentation of this event as long as op is able to show that the crossing date was within the validity of the us tourism date that should help op i recommend trying the crossing on a day trip with a close friend and not colleagues gather the following in case its needed <number> asylum filing form that shows the date the initial request was made on entry into canada <number> canadian passport <number> canadian naturalization documents <number> copies of lease or mortgage papers and your work contract on a canadian passport you should be able to cross without issue but showing deep ties in canada and an intention to return should aid in that also empty out your car of extraneous stuff you dont want them looking in it and deciding you packed for an extended stay not a day tip to go to traget,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTmVlNXBPcXJlbUY4MFgwVm9FcFp5TjB1bjBEOG5aMm5lSDlydzFyTnBaZ2FvU2ZhaGh0MVdwTkJEQmxpNGt0N0tsU3NaQ0tTaVFNN0h0ZGRvQ2JzSEE9PQ==

uscis is not saying they arent going to accept your crba an rfe isnt necessarily a bad thing its exactly what it says a request for additional evidence you even admit to the discrepancies regarding your status the onus of updating uscis of your usc status fell on your parents when you were a minor and now on you as an adult if no one ever sent documents to update uscis its not unreasonable for them to request additional evidence to clarify itd be worth your while to get a consult with an immigration lawyer but additional evidence would likely be your dads birth certificate your dads list of addresses prior to your entry to the us the dna test the crba approval notice or docs re the application your ssn card etc theyre not trying to trick you but if you dont provide them info and documentation pertaining to your status they wont have it theyre just trying to clarify and correct your record eta suing or going any other nuclear option will definitely take way more time and energy than just sending additional docs with the rfe,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOU9JUk5wMVJSRXlsZ3hwbHEwVVdSTlhLNlpfQlY0TXJHUExNS3lDc2pzS3R4bDRNRU9HcWpudXJtUTVtN2NRSlVDM0tReVJaeWt3NGlsX1dUSUc5TUE9PQ==

doesnt work like this at all you cant just move to the us and you are not getting a greencard like that most immigrants come through family sponsorship that means they are married to an american or got immediate family this is the most common way to acquire a greencard every other option involves investing a lot of money or being extraordinarily talented in ones field getting permanent residency in the us is impossible for most people without direct family for the standard hb work visa you need at least a ba thats equal to a us one and some work experience plus a sponsoring company the company then enters the applicant into a lottery pool the chances of actually getting an hb are <number><number> as its extremely oversubscribed a company wont even go through the trouble unless they really want you and cant find anyone in the us to do the same job the easiest option is working for an international company with offices in the us and then get a transfer via an l visa the most difficult part is probably convincing your employer to actually go through with such a move again if its not necessary they might not want to do it thats your options,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNi1fZENSQXN3bXAweXZ0RVNJVGxpa0gzUDdJQkJVaWdnZmJlZjdBdlBJRXV3TTFvZmZjdUtPMW54TGVmekNVb1BlaXpxajQtSGl0azR1MTZLaGVBRnc9PQ==

the basic requirements for moral or religious convictions are that they object to all vaccines of any form and that the conviction is sincere for the latter point the burden is entirely on the applicant to demonstrate that its not just a preference for the purposes of getting the waiver depending on their medical history it may be difficult to demonstrate that the conviction is sincere eg if their objection is limited in scope to just vaccines there wont be other examples they can draw on of going against their own selfinterest and thats not the us governments problem they should be prepared to account for any vaccines that they have previously received eg they were a child at the time under the authority of a parent in order to show that they arent objecting to just one vaccine > im looking for straightforward advice obviously the best advice in this situation is to just get the required vaccines,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhbHVGcDNoSUphRGxqdkEyRXJ1M1FxMzZpSTVuRlRfZGJUTjlmYkRzalRaYmtLOUhyNjBQRmN6c043cEQ0LS12S093SlVIQmZjQ1FEWUNlZnY0Y1hUMUE9PQ==

the k is a bad choice of visas if you are wanting to try a vaccine waiver as they cause significant delays and the k is a nonimmigrant visa that has an expiration date written on it they can easily just say its expired and you would need to start over again the k really doesnt have an appeal process to it either are you able to show that he has never received any vaccinations ever if you dont have proof of that and they can check by drawing blood titers then his likelihood of having this be approved is even lower worldwide the k issuance rate is only about <number> after interview so does he want to keep those moral grounds and add a few years before immigrating to the us chances are the k would not get approved youd have to start over with a spouse visa and then do the <number> after the interview for that,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVnZKZTR3TnMyajdja1o3bzVHZHM2T01JdTBMM3QtRmNtQnFlQlBLMWFzYzRYQld2OUxqUnhMQTRIcUc0Ql92T0daQlRYaTdJRk9nb1FLN1h6Y2sweWc9PQ==

i dont think the k is the proper visa if theres no intention of living in the us you dont go to an interview and then decide what visa you want to petition for after the interview ucatbearfish you said that your fiance lives in hong kong where do you live do you just want to get married or do you specifically want to get married in the us is there any reason you cant get married in hong kong or any other country if your fiance just wants to visit the us you want to get married here maybe because your family is here or something then they can enter on a visitor visa get married and then return home the burden of proof that they will not stay in the us and just adjust status may be higher if you are not living in the us or you can prove that after your marriage you will be leaving the us to live with your spouse its fairly straight forward its perfectly legal to get married on a tourist visa in the us you just cant come here on a tourist visa with the plan to get married and adjust status the k takes at least a year is significantly more expensive and has a lot of scrutiny im not sure why that would be the preferred visa for this,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVDE3WjVoVzVjSmRXTnBGYkNTcUhQMjdJQXc2Y0F0Yy0xM3R4UkZkV1N2blM5OUVPcjFIZUtKOTlwQ0JkNktiOVFKeHViOVJNeWtMVXJWX0xJMlExZGc9PQ==

if you havent filed yet i would just get married and do the spouse visa it allows for the <number> waiver if needed it has an appeals process if it is denied because of this and its significantly more affordable than the k with many benefits you can get married in the us in the uk wherever you want but he cant come to the us on esta with the purpose of marrying and staying here immediately he would need to return to the uk while the spouse visa is in process visiting is fine just not an excessive amount the k is prob <number> months start to finish and the spouse visa is prob <number><number> months start to finish so you save a lot of money for just slightly longer and its prob more of a sure thing though there could still be additional time with the spouse visa if he wants to do the waiver but you have quite a bit of time to see what happens in the world,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhOWFLT0JkOFF2X3d0VDVaSWJJRDQ0YWdET2xVcEVaSkpRTVQ2R3B2dmV0WHo5V0tuNkpJOFBzRWdMMXBRcnVuVGlHdjM1cWlHcF9sMTFsbHdZNkwtVmc9PQ==

like i mentioned it is legal to get married on a bb but actually getting approved for a bb with the specific intention of getting married in the us is a different conversation as i would never recommend lying to the visa officer during an interview obtaining a bb for the purpose of getting married in the us will be nearly impossible especially in a country like china where many have a good reason to try to leave any way they can i just have a difficult time seeing any visa officer approve that visa remember the tourist visa interview starts from the presumption of intending immigrant and it is the job of the applicant to convince the visa officer in <number> minutes or less they dont intend to use the tourist visa as a means to bypass us immigration laws the k is a longer process more complex and most people do it with the intent of immigration but there should be no hiccups and the visa officer at the time of interview really wont care what the plans are after the wedding they are looking to see if it is a sham marriage and thats it personally i would recommend getting married in a third country then get her a tourist visa and having a second ceremonial marriage in the us and getting the marriage registered in the us maybe but the op said she wants to get married in the us bottom line there is no easyefficient solution but the k is the best fit for what the op wants to do imho,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhMG1QQVAwR29kSHp6MENSVmlwbnpUUkRrV2psc0xXUDhFVjBSbndoTzlTeFJYTzNocXliX0ZkVmpwWDRRd1FYTG53emNxS0ZKZHBGT21sdUdzZ29Md1E9PQ==

first congratulations on your upcoming nuptials second as my grandfather would say whoa horsey nothing and i meant nothing to do with immigration is going to be fast and rarely easily please dont get you hopes up for getting married and coming her right away and settling down im not trying to be rude just trying to keep you grounded if its any consolation the time frames will have nothing to do with it being an arranged marriage its just the way the law works you cant get a fiance vise because you dont have a perexisting relationship but that would apply to anyone that had had a purely online relationship as well also make sure you do this the right way id strongly suggest a lawyer its illegal to enter on a visitor visa with the intent to immigrate that could get you barred from the us for a long time remember just because you marry a us citizen does not mean you have to be given a green card they can refuse it without a prior relationship and having lied about your reason for entering the us using a visitor visa to immigrate would put you in a tough stop so please dont think about trying that also marrying online without having met before and after wont help you you wont be considered married until you have met after you married online trying that would likely just cause more problems your fiance needs to contact a us based immigration lawyer to help you through this it will cost more but if you screw it up accidentally it will take a lawyer and lots more money and time to fix it do it right the first time even if it takes you a year or two,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUGxGNjhMT1Q5ZnVpbGJZdVJJM0k1LXFVYmtlanFOUjJhYU10VVBzNVpXOFM3MVVYNS1tYlRXODA0R1dMd0NqdzJZeWdNRURHUWF4VHVIc0pVLXBDczh6REhMdnNBUXJ4c1l4XzM0R2dLTWs9

if you read the project <number> rundowns they give what is probably our best guess at this point for what things will look like and they are mostly focused on clamp downs on illegals and gumming up the works by a lot of nitty rules like requiring security clearance for immigration officers or requiring backlogs be cleared before even considering more visas less so slashing whole classes of visas or paths to gc just making them suck a lot more although there is a whole thing on requiring immediate exiting of the country on invalid or rejected applications which is a bit of an eyebrow raiser basically opening the question of potentially requiring petitioners to leave even if something on their application was a minor error but again proj <number> is not trumps direct policy it is a heritage foundation authored set of recommendations please give me a job in the administration essay collection,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOXFHS3RUTndFeTM1TG5LRTVkVzBFengyTlRyZ2lKcERzek5TM1pDeHVfbHNERnlmVzBaS085NzR1MlJhVzNocnlXdUFDWjE0N3lMQW01ZVdySlZ4cnc9PQ==

fair enough but its not that straightforward to be honest it is a very subjective evaluation and a lot of people will be in the gray area a scientist with several publications a few awards and lot of recognition in their field may or may not get an eba approval i know several friends and colleagues who filed for eba everyone has a phd and not everyone made it some cases were obviously not eba level accomplishments but it seemed quite subjective to be honest you can read aao decisions on eba appeals but that being said i agree with you that its very easy to know if you dont qualify for eba,r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN29BNnFFd25jTl9QNHpCWTF1ZExJWWF3ZldwME92b3JhNkxtSnRMNHNqUzVQdmFZR2JVTnpFVGNUd253Q2VqRUNDSzVmUm5PZWtDeFVIZlRUWGNlY0E2M0NiSVpnSFU3YTZzUTgxUC1Dc1U9
