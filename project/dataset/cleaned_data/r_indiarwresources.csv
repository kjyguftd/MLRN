full text of the post for archiving purposes hello posting on an alt account for privacy reasons but i am an chinese american college student majoring in international studies at jhu sais i have translated and summarized one of the most popular posts on zhihu chinas quora about chinese indian relations i feel this is useful information to share as it summarizes and explains the ccps current view of india accurate based on my personal links to ccp and explains why china behaves so antagonistically this post is long but is still much shorter than the original the original has <number> chapters chapters <number> <number> focusing on chinese military strategy in a sino indian war in the rindia post i have focused on the politics and reasons for conflict described in chapters <number><number> for rgeopolitics i have added a shortened version of chapter <number> describing the importance of taiwan in chinese grand strategy i have left out most of the historical background chinese idioms and cultural aspects in an effort to shorten the post the most important parts are in bold and italicized i would highly recommend reading those feel free to pm with any questions ill try to answer some in the comments apologies in advance for mistranslations andor incorrect information if this post gets enough attention i will post all the chapters and maybe even the full translation if you want to read the full post i have attached the link google translate is <number> accurate and there are a few very important errors link to post <url><url> chapter one india is big trouble for china in the future today china faces significant problems on its borders totally surrounded by strong neighbors the united states has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security russia although it has a small population has a large geographical advantage although sinorussian relations are good in the short term it could be a big variable in the long run however an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is india india is very weak on the surface but has a greater potential for development if you take the longterm view india is likely to be a significant power in the future one reason many people like to laugh at india is that in the s the economic strength of china and india was evenly matched but after chinas reform and opening up chinas economy grew rapidly and chinas gdp is now five times that of india this shows how slow indias economic growth is however if you compare it on a global scale you can actually find that indias economic growth is not slow since <number> indias gdp has increased <number> fold in contrast the gdp of other developing countries except china and india has only increased <number> fold and the gdp of developed countries has even increased <number> fold to a certain extent it is not that indias economic development is slow but that chinas economic growth is too fast chinas economic achievements conceal indias economic miracle if there is no comparison with china then indias economic growth can be considered a global miracle on the other hand chinas rapid economic growth has not come without a price due to strict family planning rules china today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time india has not implemented such a strict family planning policy and the proportion of young people is very high although this has dragged down economic growth indias demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years we know that young people are the main creators of social wealth and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of china to some extent if the number of young people in india is twice that of china in <number> even if indias per capita output is only half of china by then indias gdp will be on par with china and become the worlds top three economies a power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated although india is a very weak country at the moment and the lower limit is low but the future development potential is very large the upper limit is very high although china is now flourishing if one day the country is facing an aging crisis on one hand fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers on the other hand the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time the national willingness to fight is reduced at that time it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising india than it is now chapter two the conflicts between china and india can hardly be reconciled it is difficult to reconcile the chinaindia conflict just as it was difficult to reconcile the chinasoviet conflict before the collapse of the soviet union the underlying reasons are not explained by ideology territorial disputes cultural differences or foreign policy in the s and s chinas greatest threat was from none other than the soviet union if a torrent of soviet tanks goes south from mongolia it will hit beijing within a week since ancient times the greatest external threat to china has been from the north and in modern times soviet russia has assumed this role during the cold war the soviet union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks this was similar to ancient cavalry fast and ruthless able to tear a hole in the opponents defenses in a very short time the key issue is that during the cold war the soviet union maintained absolute geographic superiority the soviet union not only controlled the outer northeast but also mongolia when the soviet union did not control mongolia if the soviet union wanted to attack china it still had to go south from the northeast plain and enter north china after conquering the shanhai pass but with control of the mongolian plateau the soviet union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking china soviet tanks only had to cross the yinshan mountains to enter hebei after that beijing would be basically insecure to defend in this case china may only have to move south like the central plains dynasties in the past and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the soviet army this is the fundamental reason why china would fight with the soviet union during the cold war and cooperate with the west without hesitation as long as mongolia is controlled by the soviet union chinas national defense cannot be assured thanks to an independent mongolia china and russia are moving towards reconciliation in the long run due to russias natural geopolitical suppression it is still a potential threat and china and russia still guard against each other taking the example of the soviet union we can understand why sinoindian relations are difficult to reconcile the geography of india is very similar to china the main population centers of china are on the north china plain and beijing is the throat into the north china plain the population centers of india are on the ganges plain and new delhi is the throat to enter the ganges plain the south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline and the southeast has a large island like sri lanka but compared to china indias geography is extremely bad all of the core areas of india are in the hands of other countries indus river lower ganges siri lanka india does not have many natural barriers the coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west while china only needs to defend the east this makes india very easy to invade as seen in history this is the reason why india invaded tibet in the s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time it cannot be said that india is a militaristic state but because in the context of geographical disadvantages it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents for india china is the biggest geothreat this is because china not only controls the qinghaitibet plateau but also is an ally with pakistan once china and india go to war india will almost certainly lose without external intervention indias ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage the geographical disadvantages of the qinghaitibet plateau and the alliance between china and pakistan are part of the reasons why chinaindia relations cannot be reconciled but in the long run even if china and india can complete the territorial conflicts and china and pakistan no longer are allies it will be difficult for china and india to reconcile completely the reason is that both china and india want to become superpowers and leaders in asia inevitably leading to strategic collisions in the future if both china and india want to rise up and become leaders in asia conflicts of interest will inevitably arise the key point of the conflict is southeast asia the backyard of both counties southeast asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war on the other hand southeast asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries forming battlegrounds for any major countries china and india both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region southeast asia has many chinese and indians to a certain extent southeast asia is to china and india what latin america is to the united states eastern europe is to germany and russia and north korea is to china and japan they belong to the range of interests that must be contested therefore if both china and india become stronger in the future they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in southeast asia on land india can rely on the northeast states to

full text of the post for archiving purposes hi i liked the discussion on this sub i read in past <number> days so i really wanted to dig deep into this topic and i did some research today about leadership of india not the usual modi manmohan bajpeyi and dr kalam but about their other leaders like in state or district or just random political leaders with power and popularity what was shocking to me was many of them were radical hindutva bigots some communists and corrupt leaders too very similar to us where we have radical islamist left ones and corrupt but what was the shocking part was that most of the state leader i searched chief minister were mostly non corrupt and very less radical or atleast not giving radical speeches except few like yogi in up their state leaders are mostly inclined to their state identity and its progress and selected by people directly so examples i looked into are cm and hm of gujarat the state of modi are not corrupt the hm lives in a normal appartment building like i see in lahore and sounds very smart as i couldnt understand half his words similar was the cm of kerala of the communist party the finance minister of a state called telangana from south was talking about promoting blockchain technology which waqar zaka keeps talking about that our government doesnt listen to him the bjp hindutva mp from banglore speaks a lot of facist things but he is also promoting bangalore as it hub and talking about creating rd hub of asia there and what progress they made i read about almost all their chief ministers and except yogi cm of assam maharashtra shiv sena cm most other <number> cm were not that vocal facists and most including yogi guy are not very corrupt only corrupt politicians i found with very high level of corruption like we have here in zardari sharif were politicians from maharashtra tamil nadu and bihar which to be honest is very shocking and made me think about this question that what is difference here as we have same people they too have radical religious extremists their media feels more state funded and propoganda machine than ours people i have seen online or interacted sounds similar so what really is the difference i am unable to point out really how they are having so many good leaders at state level and even their worst leaders are radicals but not corrupt and even leaders like arvind kejriwal of aap party in delhi non radical and non corrupt someone similar to ik so my question is what you guys think were we go wrong or we went wrong is it that our civil societies were unable to spread awareness or education or something else i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposeto=rindiarwresources if you have any questions or concerns,r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQW4tSHRteEpDMGxBVWtyRlRBSFQwTnUxc2hpNVB6YmpPeFRKc3ZscXZOaUR2bkRpVHY5X2xZc054LWVCOE1FQ2RzSUJaUWZBUjR0OHNzeThLYnZQU1E9PQ==

so because white men commit most pedophilic crime they should be stereotyped as rapists murderers and terrorists murderers and terrorists seems like a bigger issue considering the percentage compared to pedos obviously pedos are a problem but the average person wont be murdered robbed or raped by a pedo while casually walking in public while they could most probably be robbed attacked murdered by someone else who statistically might not be a pedo the way you figure out statistically is mind boggling,r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdE80RUFCZGpTbGZxd01UQVV4ajJueGtLVWI2WG9ZUVAzYWZndDhONFRuSUFxMHU2YnpkMHVPVFMxY3hvTWx0azA3UzBIVVJUV0FjdWdfQUxCMElEUWc9PQ==

posting top comment here for archiving purpose both india and pakistan essentially follow british operational and tactical principles as well as unit organization before and during ww there were around <number> kings commissioned indian officers kcios who held commands of real significance and these men took over both the indian and pakistani armies after the war the summary of british operational art in the colonies around ww was essentially defense in depth until sufficient concentration could be achieved for a counterattack offensives were not to be launched until a mass was built this was largely because colonial land was considered expendable the british army certainly would have had a different approach defending britain itself tactically british sop revolves around bounding whether we are talking about infantry tanks artillery or whatever any moving element should have a complimentary and ideally equal base of fire supporting it unsurprisingly india won all the wars against pakistan despite military budget parity between the two until <number> this is because british colonial operational art was entirely unsuited to pakistans situation and entirely complimentary to indias pakistan had no strategic depth in the west or the east so it had to attack the british army never pulled off a single successful blitzkrieg against a peer foe in its history and even less could be expected of its impoverished foreign colonies due both to preference and british command and control which lacked both the decentralization of germanjapanese command and the fast staff work of soviet command the british way of war did not operate at the speed of some of its peers commonwealth senior officers across the empire preferred to probe maneuver and test before major actions and their command and reporting practices developed around that consequently all the indopakistani wars followed a familiar pattern pakistan launching a clumsy blitzkrieg poorly imitating the practices of a more offensively capable force like china <number> or israel <number> india effectively bogging it down through defense in depth and then embarrassing pakistan with a massive counterattack this situation was made more inevitable by the fact that both forces were and still are largely infantry based with less support assets than any other great powers such armies naturally fare better on the defensive than the offensive unless overwhelming mass can be attained india naturally had the advantage in obtaining this mass as it had interior lines until <number> east and west pakistan were between india the primary differences between the doctrines of the two rivals were realisminformation control and equipment if you read indian military journals theyre a lot like journals in any other great power country pakistani journals are something else they never assess the results of previous actions any historical anecdote is purely for story along the lines of i commanded <number> fine men who fought bravely at longewala it was a tough day and the sun was hot this is because the pakistani army coped with defeat by becoming resultsagnostic they spawned a revisionist historical take where india was always a vastly superior foe both forces were almost equal on paper until <number> and where all combat with india is a victory because pakistan is still around see fighting to the end the pakistan armys way of war for a thorough account of this transformation the second difference is in equipment india has traditionally bought sovietrussian equipment and pakistan sinoamerican this is largely why the pakistani air force unlike the ground forces has tended to outperform indias this is where doctrinal differences are also the most pronounced while ground forces can still make do with updated versions of british ttp aerial doctrine has evolved massively since <number> india has primarily received soviet training and pakistan american and later chinese once the plaafs doctrine became pirated american manuals paf places far more emphasis on dogfighting and individual actions while india has stricter ground control and focuses on massed aerial operations this is not to say pafs record is spotless however they failed on a number of occasions most notably their farcical imitation of the israeli air force in operation chinghiz khan this failure and others were primarily spawned by resource issues there were simply not enough planes on the ground and at sea however the technological balance was reversed soviet ships and antiship missiles made an excellent account of themselves in <number> as pakistans navy was ravaged and the country was put under blockade soviet apcs which had more widespread amphibious capabilities than their western counterparts also enabled a rapid indian advance through riverdense bangladesh both forces especially in recent decades have tried to create their own equipment here the pakistanis have had more success again because of discrepancy in allied capabilities india was highly successful in purchasing russian tot after <number> but the russian defense industry after <number> was in an absolutely miserable state pakistan meanwhile has had the full support and cooperation of china whose defense industry has followed the complete opposite trajectory as far as how indian doctrine compares to other major powers its overall more flexible but slower and more measured in its operations than any of them the us china and russia have all focused on increasing optemp through different means and different extents with russia being the most obsessive this has not really been a priority for india tactically indian doctrine is most like american doctrine but even here its quite distant as it borrows mainly from british principles,r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdjByTWhTbVJ4Q04zZ19EVFZHQXRYQ3Brc1NEUi1TWXZEMmtFbkdPUUlEZThQQ1N6WU9yblpWWE1KQXoxbDY5TDJiMW9lWEZReGR1VTJUMlk3TjRiYXc9PQ==

if you look into this research in some detail the nuclear nature of the weapons is of minimal importance the effect highlighted here is the result of two main factors <number> by far the most important effect is the rapid incineration of modern cities containing many plastics this is what supplies the black carbon which in these particular conditions leads to cooling this is analogous to wwii era firebombing in principle but modern cities are larger and have a different composition the heat of the thermonuclear explosion is also vastly more efficient at incineration <number> the initial explosion can punch through the tropopause facilitating transport to the stratosphere and thereby global dispersal and cooling in many simulations however the scale of the fires is often sufficient and the heat they produce enough to transport material to the stratosphere anyway this is somewhat analogous to recent australian wildfires i dont think it is emphasized enough that these same effects could be accomplished in large part by other high energy or incendiary means governments are not known to possess any other devices of comparable power but large scale use of conventional ordinance in a total war scenario might result in similar effects a key source of uncertainty is we do not know what happens when large modern cities become targets for total destruction,r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaHUySXFYbDA0dW41dERuTTNIOHNja3RxSUkySlBDb0dWdXJoRFpGckNPMzgwbVhmWlpQa0NWek91bVJ1M1JQeWdLdURFUEZlOWZIdGNJSjZfb3ptSUE9PQ==

full text of the post for archiving purposes myth <number> the british abolished slavery in india <number> very specific form of chattel slavery they claim to abolish ignoring the fact that they compensated the slave owners not the slaves and sent the freed slaves into various other forms of slavery as i will describe below indian indenture imgxujygwc normally normally indentured servitude isnt normally considered slavery but indian indenture was something else millions of starving impoverished indians coerced to sign contracts they cant even read or simply kidnapped taken onto ships in horrible conditions to colonies in africa and the americas working under the scorching sun on plantations getting whipped as a punishment is commonplace wages are mysteriously withheld and contract are mysteriously extended bonded slavery continued after the indenture negating the abolition of the indian indenture in <number> and the viceroy chelmsford admitted it was only being done due to economic disadvantage not goodwill sxual slavery imgxueukjqwc type <number> women and even young girls are kidnapped in broad daylight by soldiers to cantonments where they are rped rigorous id system and medical checks only for girls not for male soldiers justification is a deterrent to homosexuality type <number> the devadasi is a female hindu artist who is dedicated to the worship or service of a deity or a temple for the rest of her life they were forced into sxual slavery by the british after they defeated the patrons of the temple the kings even when the british passed the bombay devadasi protection act <number> they didnt even enforce the law justifying it with confusion between devadsai and nonreligious street dancers indian members of the imperial legislative council passed the child marriage restraint act <number> fixing the age of marriage for girls at <number> years and boys at <number> years the british were enraged they did not enforce the law justifying it by losing support from hindus and muslims prison slavery imgytjnduwc their only crime fighting for their freedom men women and children are sent to horrific prisons where not only are they subject to inhumane torture dehumanization unethical human experimentation intentional exposure to malaria typhoid plague dysentery and testing cures that only made the subject worse and brutal electrical shocks for mad patients and being drowned in food and milk a jail diet with literal kerosene inside but also backbreaking slave labor eg oil mills they are expected to extract more oil than a literal bull or grinding coconuts which literally drove some insane famine relief camps imgegcqywc from the late th century continuing well into the s and s these horrific camps existed basically after waiting for a few hundred thousand or a few million deaths in famines of their own exacerbation due to exporting food the british would set up these famine relief camps thousands of miles away from faminestricken villages if the already starving indians managed to reach the camp they would be literally forced to perform excruciating slave labor for a ration lower than buchenwald with literally zero nutritional value couple that with the overcrowding lack of sanitation and hygiene and even unethical human experimentation eg they forcibly divided families one outside the camp and one inside the camp and questioned hmm in both cases will they starve not so fun fact they did so its no surprise that the mortality rates for some of the camps were as high as <number> only made the suffering of the starving indians worse in <number> a prominent british nutritionist stationed in india wr aykroyd tried to put an end to this practice by giving rations of actually nutritious value but he was flatout ignored by his higherups of course in independent india famines are extremely rare so these camps were shut down and dismantled criminal tribes acts imgptvpbwc <number> onwards one of the most draconian acts of the raj this categorized millions of people from various communities mostly nomadic and seminomadic but also transgender people as criminals by birth at first they were subject to weekly reporting to the police more discrimination than other indians awful police brutality and surveillance however in <number> onwards cultural genocide started through the legal kidnapping of children into socalled reformatory settlements from <number> on slavery was introduced in this act through forced resettlement to special settlementsslave labor camps they were confined to essentially being enslaved for the rest of their lives in independent india while these communities still suffer to an extent from the pre<number> actions there are thankfully no more reformatory and special settlements land revenue systems most notably and longlastingly the zamindari system imgssyjewtawc zamindari system although it existed before british rule the british made it in its most infamous form the permanent settlement of <number> the zamindari system involved the british granting large and fertile tracts of land to feudal lords known as zamindars they were responsible for collecting revenue for the millions of peasants working on the land and then paying a fixed amount to their british higherups sometimes there were sub zamindars between the peasants and zamindars with varying degrees of power however the zamindars severely exploited the peasants imposing extremely high taxes on them and trapping them in a cycle of debt and poverty and the british were fully complicit with them and of course they profited the most out of this slavery only abolished after independence ryotwari system introduced in the s it was meant to eliminate the zamindar middleman between the peasants and the british however it came with its own drawbacks as the rates for taxes were guaranteed to be <number> in the dryland and <number> in the wetland so if the farmer had a bad harvest well good luck to try and avoid this peasants took loans from moneylenders who of course didnt give any sht about them being happy to exploit so it was a loselose situation for the peasants it was replaced in the late th and early th centuries by similar systems to the zamindari system the mahalwari system was introduced in <number> the mahalwari system was intended to protect village autonomy by making them the ones paying taxes directly to the state however since the british were absolute buffoons in their assumptions about the land area and crop yield in the system this led to widespread corruption and exploitation it had the same fate as the ryotwari out of the frying pan and into the fire myth <number> sure the laissezfaire policies of the british led to great famines in india throughout the late th century but the development of the famine codes eradicated this with the exception of the special case of bengal in <number> i wont go over bengal <number> as that is the topic for another post there are a plethora of myths perpetuated by apologists but i will go over the main part of this myth quick terminology a famine is considered a great famine if it has <number>+ deaths first of all if the famine codes eradicated the great famines then what was the need for the relief camps to continue well into the s and s the picture of a relief camp is from <number> bengal or why did aykroyd unsuccessfully recommend making the rations humane it makes you wonder let us quickly go overbengal during the s between <number> and <number> pic below there were a string of famines which culminated in minimum <number> million deaths essentially there was the equivalent of a great famine happening each year in bengal alone this timeframe dispels the myth completely imgjdmygeiwc from the demography of indian famines a historical perspective by arup maharatna london school of economics and political science a thesis submitted for the degree of phd in demography university of london <number> from bengal we go tomadras between <number> and the beginning of world war ii famine visited parts of madras five more times in <number> <number> <number> <number> and <number> r suryanarayana rao a member of the sis and social service league of madras pushed for more indian contribution to relief than the horrible camps set up by the british he was a vocal critic of the madras famine code and rightfully so in <number> the government of india act <number> commenced which although still retained british superiority and even had some regressions churchill described the broad sweep of emergency powers given to lord linlithglow as likely to rouse mussolinis envy it gave some concessions to indians ie more provincial autonomy this was good news for rao rao joined themadras famine code revision committee in <number> when parts of madras were still in the midst of a famine alarmed by thescale of the famine that affected several districts at once the committee evaluated the current response and reached the conclusion that a bolder policy was needed it offeredfarreaching recommendationsfor the reform of the provincial famine code such as theabolition of the grain equivalent and the increase of wages and rations it noted thatwomen workers received an insufficient amount of calories and that childrens rations lacked fat it also pointed out that theallowances of vegetables were lower than in jail diets and thus generally insufficient these minute recommendations were overshadowed by the demand for a more fundamental change the committee recommended that thepreamble o,r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMGlteEZGajM1c05nZmVzY0VUTDRnc1pPamlDLVJhX3l1TmJkcWU3Yms3X2FMc3EydFZQMUE1Q0pRRGdqY0pySG9nelRDWWQ2OW0zNVlEaWhYMGdIUFE9PQ==

full text of the post for archiving purposes chinas foreign policy strategy has evolved over different periods from <number> to the s chinas primary foreign policy principle was defense through offense in essence this meant dont attack my homeland or challenge my sovereignty and dont try to isolate me from the global system to strangle me if i sense youre trying to do any of these ill attack you i know my performance over the past century has been poor and im aware that my foundation is still weak but that doesnt mean ill show weakness on the contrary ill act unpredictably and aggressively i wont wait for you to escalate step by step ill take the initiative and do something big suddenly you might find me overly aggressive and irrational but ill eventually pull back only after making you pay a heavy price and leaving you with longterm psychological trauma when i feel secure and no longer isolated from the global system ill settle down then youll realize that i can be quite peaceful because my fundamental goal is defensive to protect chinas core and ensure my access to global development opportunities if you dont understand me well just keep wearing each other down ill pay a heavy price too but this is the best choice i can make after weighing all the harms whether its the soviet union or the us the more powerful you are the more ill dare to confront you betting that you wont risk too much for another powers gain middle powers shouldnt think they can deal with me just because im facing the us and the ussr apart from them everyone else is much weaker than me and i can handle you with a secondary force just look at india and vietnam during this period the most striking impression of china in the west was its extreme aggressiveness henry kissinger was one of the first to understand china he noted that the chinese volunteer armys sudden intervention in korea to strike us forces seemed like a highly conspiratorial offensive chinas shelling of kinmen seemed like a deliberate provocation of war its global revolutionary export appeared aimed at promoting worldwide communism the sinosoviet ideological debates seemed like a struggle for orthodoxy but underlying all these actions was defense albeit through aggressive means therefore negotiating with china was entirely possible with kissinger and nixons efforts the us sorted out its security relationship with china before the ussr did the soviets never managed to rectify this until it was too late which i discuss in another article by the late s china had largely achieved its two major defensive goals homeland security and integration into the global system from the late s to now chinas primary foreign policy principle has been winning through speed this can be explained as my homeland is secure and i have a place in the global development environment now i want to make money and develop im willing to make concessions if they benefit these two goals i dont care much if you criticize me because making money is more important than saving face i can tolerate minor losses because i believe that with development the future will be mine i can stay composed if you try to destabilize me because im growing rapidly im not afraid of your threats because you wont want to fight me to the death if you push too hard i might lash out briefly but then ill get back to business i might seem timid and lacking confidence but im growing quickly so ill still win when ive fully developed ill be able to hold my head high at that point youll see that im quite capable of making waves as for specific goals i havent decided yet ill let future generations figure that out if you dont understand my grand ambitions just wait for my peaceful evolution even if you see through me it wont matter because most of you wont realize it until ive achieved my goals i know my actions might disappoint many of my people and cause confusion but this is the choice that maximizes my benefits after careful consideration since the collapse of the soviet union china has rapidly realigned its grand strategy securing a sinorussian security bloc in the short term this was defensive but in the long term it was a strong offensive against the us though the shortterm goal might have been the initial intent by the late s china had ambitious military plans after joining the wto in <number> china launched an economic offensive to capture market share since <number> china has mounted a complex political geographical and economic offensive against the us in <number> it escalated to a strong military standoff with the us during this period the most striking impression of china in the west has been its incredible speed the rapid growth of chinas military capabilities its increasing economic integration its global political influence its strategic positioning in its surrounding regions its adjustments to interest groups and its handling of the pandemicall have been remarkably swift the us often found itself either unable to react in time or forced into hasty poorly coordinated responses simply comparing the raw power of the us to chinas isnt sufficient aside from any exaggerations the mere fact that plans cant keep up with changes has made it difficult for the us to effectively leverage its strength from what ive seen online its only in recent years that western mainstream elites have begun to understand chinas high level of ambition some have realized that a new phase of chinese assertiveness is imminent and a few have even developed a kind of lovecraftian fear about chinas goals however most have yet to find an effective strategy to counter this i believe theres only one clear path and currently theyre still in a state of frantic disarray a few smart individuals might have figured it out but no one with significant influence has dared to speak out whether theres some deep state secretly pushing for action remains unknown the guiding principle of winning through speed is likely to continue until the s beyond that i speculate that it will evolve into exercising power to establish order i am a bot and this action was performed automatically
