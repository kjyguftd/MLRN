ips change all the time the vast majority of the world uses variable ip addresses which means that each time you disconnect your mobile phone for example from wifi and gsm networks then reconnect between <number> minutes to <number> hours later depending on some variables you get a new ip address the same goes for your home router disconnect it for the amount of time your isp or network provider has set for your ip to release and then reconnect it then youll have a new ip address the only cases where static ip addresses are widely used are when companies have either bought ip addresses or have leased them from the isp or network provider so ip addresses change a lot which means that any ip addresses you have or any ip address youve collected might as well be used by someone else but it might not be someone elses yet it all depends how long the isp lets a device hold the ip address how long the device has had an uninterrupted internet connection and much much more,r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI0eGRNS0U3MWdXYVNRc2NuRmNJUUozN3RIUnhkcDMwaXd3SThjNkVZdWFrWUxWRmZRQmoteGpRU0hBRkVJZ3c2Uzl1WFlhWHZJSldNZHFpLUdMSVFWRkE9PQ==

the risk will go into our corporate risk register essentially we are so close to audit that when im avoiding using if on purpose as its so obvious the auditor discovers theres no evidence that any of the processes have been followed it will most certainly result in a major nonconformity and failure the only way of bringing it back is to say that weve discovered the issue in our latest internal audit and having done so a risk has been raised staff are beginning to work following the processes and if certified we will be able to produce evidence in our annual audit next year outside of causing embarrassment my theory is that transparency with a remediation plan might be our saving grace not reporting will surely result in failure,r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHUUt0S2VNLVNyeThaS04tWGotV0lROFJjTVlxazJzT2tfcERhNUJtNjBScDZFclppdklTOWV0a0pXU1c3ZlNMTWEtOXVhU1IzRWNEM0VuWFdBVWt1bzBSNUR6d3UzdmdxR1pra3F1VGVaVVE9

generally speaking when hardware tokens are sent they are shipped without the seed files upon arrival the recipient then requests their seed file using an online form and after supplying their order details the seed file is sent to the email address that was confirmed during the initial order as the tokens cannot be used without the seed data this is pretty secure but if additional security is needed you could consider using programmable tokens with programmable tokens you can generate random seeds yourself,r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRTFIyWjRQZG04WlliRnZUTy1DNFcxRDV5Q0RUaGc3aWZzYzhFTi1rdzNhV19iTUoxSndLV2JodWFfaldYUzF3YVdibEpHRDVPZk03SXhGOUhuOW1Rd2c9PQ==
