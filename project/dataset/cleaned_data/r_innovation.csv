what are you interested in something fun or helpful <number> there is a nanotube sponge material has been developed nearly a decade ago that could clean up oil spills but a delivery system was never devised i have a simple autonomous drone design for it that could clean up large or small oil spills <number> large scale drip irrigation could solve the west water shortage problem i have drafted a mobile d printing option that could make it much cheaper and easier to deploy if it was adopted at even <number> of farms it would save more water than all residential and commercial water usage in the western us combined <number> for fun you could have an electronic embedded shirt that would have touch sensors for drums a keyboard or a guitar that could play notes when touched you could have a full band with just the shirts people are wearing it would be simple enough to make a functional mock up for the competition i have details on all of them if you are interested in any of them,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbXZaWTJqNFY5ZU1sM3Q0TVZsY1UwUGwzN3ZJcDkydEdfOU1yY3p3dWN0bm9CSWxXUGpza1Y5WUctazNkOWZKTnp6aWpSOTlhdHdXaUNLcUVlalBNZVVBWDRyVkNkQzVVQk43eWRnWFgtbHc9

okay so lots to unpack here firstly separate logical thinking and problem solving these are different mental skills problem solving usually involves discipline to stick to a problem definition approach the intelligence to find the insights that render the problem solvable the wisdom to separate the important insights from the noise and the creativity divergent thinking to evaluate multiple solutions logical thinking per the traditions of formal logic are more about proper processing of evidence and assumptions while remaining cognizant of and attempting to avoid the logical fallacies that constantly lay in wait to trip humans up i am a deeply logical human and formally trained in analytical philosophy and this is not something that most people want and appreciate practically in the real world the most logical person you know is either a terrible pedant or a misanthrope so lets stick with problem solving what you would want to do is identify how many meaningful questions a person could ask in response to a problem how they might go about attempting to develop learning against those questions and the quantity of possible solutions pathways they would consider you could pick a handful of thorny problems and write approaches to each and in ancient times the first step in being a genius was to be independently wealthy otherwise you were never educated possibly illiterate and toiled when you were wealthy you now had to decide whether to focus on the affairs of the day or on the theoretical learning it is the theoretical learning that survives with a name attached but know that some human devised and designed the roman aqueducts we dont know who but they were every bit the genius of the theoretical scholars on this sub i imagine youll find more aqueduct builders than nobel prize winners,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaWgyaUx1VWpmbVVNWE9mdjF6MExGWUFUb2pQRS00MXN0aERHX084akFrTGF6M1ZVcmwzNFlrd0syNTR0UTUxc3BMaWZFSFpKX2xYUnZMamRkRlFCSWc9PQ==

while i think this is true for the most part i think christensen is looking at a larger phenomenon through the keyhole of innovation there is a championchallenger dynamic at play the current champion has the winning formula for the current market to remain the champion they need to derive the winning formula for the future market there are usually very few champions and they are usually large and powerful in their domains meanwhile there is a much larger number of challengers who are pursuing a variety of strategies where the champions are uniform in their fitness to the current market challengers are diverse as the environment shifts pure dumb luck can make a challenger into a champion sticking with christensens obsession with the chip market consider intel and nvidia nvidia was a bit player pun intended until first bitcoin mining and now generative ai have sent demand for their chips to the stratosphere it wasnt brilliant innovation on nvidias part or a failure to innovate on intels part but a change in the customer needs that is driving the differential performance while i am a professor innovator its how i pay the rent i often see the market forces more in terms of biology natural selection and evolutionary forces specifically the slow lamarckian adaptation of existing firms and the periodic often seemingly spontaneous growth of nascent firms i then see the executives issue as less of an innovators dilemma and more of a diversification dilemma business leaders should invest their profits in competitors and competing technologies,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZFROdFhQVkhWMk13UTJzSTNFaHNjUzl0TmFkbzVBcEtYNllxNUpHRlpGel9PQS1FNko2UllFd2hjV3pPOVZOaEVlak5Hd2JENlRXb3AxdDgtQ1BDTmc9PQ==

having led innovation in bluechip companies it actually is a bit of a cycle depending on market conditions and strategic impetus at the time many have tried and failed to build innovation functions often because they put the wrong people in charge or didnt align business with objectives as a result many have actually cut back on innovation especially now many are focusing on the bottom line and quarterly numbers despite the fact that putting focus on innovation would be the best investment they could make right now,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTU2lUTFc4QnQ3VG05cjctaHRZd0xGREFvbFpaWEtSZzk2bU5mOU1CdGlFSzZzUDVvVkVfcWdjMndRWjFWR0l5UG9ndXVEbUFPUmRxRktyZ19MLTcweHc9PQ==

innovation comes from a particularly mature mindset think top of maslows hierarchy steve jobs and henry ford were both examples there are a few issues society values fitting in more than we value complex problem solving we dont naturally value those people they dont fit in with a lot of society because they think differently lots of them are women and poc and theyre valued even less they have great ideas but they dont get capital and if in corporate america or the military their command and control leaders dont understand how they solve problems,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQjlHMXI0Z1lNNmkwZndzdzNLTDJCVXd4aDNHbE5NT2t5bmJ5UHZXUVpKOHVUNDlYemdSMjV2SWxUOFRRT0ZfZDZLdDlPZnl5VGVzc0ZqMGZXa3FtR1E9PQ==

i agree with you we need to promote entrepreneurship but we need to address reality too there is an overwhelming sense among americans and especially younger people that if it was a good idea then the big companies would already be doing it and if no one else is doing it that means they already looked at it and decided it wont work any time you are trying to promote entrepreneurship you have to make sure that you let people know that corporate america is extremely lazy and stupid and its run by sociopaths who dont invest in anything over the long term and are always looking for the quick buck just because something isnt being done doesnt mean its not a good idea it just means that people who have the same mentality as donald trump were too stupid to understand the concept the example i like is imagine if there was no google because page and bryn allowed themselves to be discouraged when someone told them that well if that could work then yahoo would have done it already,r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSi1ldFluSGZZVzJFTkdIeEo2b2VxT1pSN1ZnMldKQUhvRWp6bnNzQlpESlh2UWpDbDBoZU90TzNtSUhMY3FXQTlOcFI1VHBSeWwwNThwcWNDcGZpVU94UU9kRFFmZkwweFFZUFVSYTN2MUE9
