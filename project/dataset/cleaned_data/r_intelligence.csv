the resume is likely being run through a computer program that scans for key words and to weed out those who may not fit the requirements its annoying as i think a lot of genuine applicants are weeded out but now days you need to basically sell yourself everyday on social media in resumes etc you probably need to add descriptions for the jobs you have done its just dot points with say <number><number> words each pack these sentences with key words so that they get highlighted by the scanning software so as an example general duties police officer <number><number> new york police department th precinct engaged in rotating shift pattern which required work across all hours of the day involved in situations requiring fast paced analysis worked in high pressure environments where attention to detail was key basically something like this probably add one or two more bullet points and give more description to what you did im not american a cop or work in intelligence stuff this is likely what they are looking for,r/intelligence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQSVgzRUtFcGJpZlVSWWFCVnd1NHNZd1Y2VDhyeFM1YXpIOXZFUGZhV2lDcFV6VU4yQW9PWHVvbTk1dGl2ejA0eDd0YjRiR085aGMzczBNdDZucmdqMkE9PQ==

for presidents their position alone entitles them to access in fact the entire system of classification and processes for access was created by and under the control of executive presidential power potus has wide authority in this regard as the executive is the one who owns the information and can unilaterally decide who should receive access however this authority is typically delegated via security clearance and other wellestablished processes but not exclusively,r/intelligence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZenB5aFc3QXllOUtUb0Q4dHM1dWFDSmdFNE9tM0V4TkhfbFVKV0E0eDFMa2dmYl9CemFldHVLTEItVjRWYU82ZzZSV05Lenk5azhxNU9Wd3d2RjhvU1E9PQ==

iirc by its very definition us federally classified materials cant be classified so that the president cant access it because all classified materials are classified under legal authority established by executive order so technically the president can selectively declassify anything so that they can see it which means in practice the president by virtue of his presidential authority has de facto access to everything classified notice how none of that actually requires the president to have a security clearance i think i heard somewhere that the president doesnt go through the security clearance ssbi process as everyone else because their ability to access information is inherent to their office so they dont actually hold a clearance while president its kind of like how the british monarch doesnt actually need a passport because a uk passport gets its legal authority from the monarch himself,r/intelligence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWGRzWXNSdzBCWWRabnFlUVRldTFtUzZOSC1iT1FNRFE4MzBJak5kbURxY1g1aTNuNDVvc2pWVXRObG8xVGIyRExYYzNDSjhVb2Y1bTcyakJHdVliNlBld0wtUklHY2RCVjlYWkt1QnBQakk9

popular theory is truman was so blindsided by the manhattan project when he took office he never wanted an incoming president to feel as powerless and overwhelmed as he did his first day in office not exactly apples to apples there though as he was never a nominee himself,r/intelligence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQm1Qcktpc2lSY0JsTkI2YUM2R0dCUTBlQkRjRmx4dFZDbVRxVnlzLUdHSXJLNmJsTTRKMnJMbkx2c1RwMXdlN2VENGdnS1ExLVBKSkFpRG1ia2lxbHc9PQ==

it makes perfect sense there is no eligibility requirement in the constitution that you be able to pass a security background check to be president or chair of the house permanent select committee on intelligence or to be a federal judge overseeing a case where the classified information procedures act has been invoked these positions are constitutional officers and the only requirements are spelled out in the constitution the classification rules and system applies to employees of the federal government who are accessing classified information under rules and procedures created by the president the president is the original and final classification authority they are also the elected representative of the american people the very idea of classification stems from the presidents authority eg the presidents authority to classify information is vested in him as a person and he is delegating it to the various entities in the federal bureaucracy the entire system of sf<number> forms and background checks is a process by which he has authorized the delegation of that power to his employees,r/intelligence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOTd1ZTlKTnRNT1pLVXZTQXBESjVwY29uWjJIMlFUSUNXMjRxS0FUUHFHUmZBcXhKWkNVSlRNMENNb3BxLXYxNDlVTld1bmdCbGFfOEQwblpUM0tFdWc9PQ==
