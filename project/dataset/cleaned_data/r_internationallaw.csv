to my knowledge the oslo accords grant israel exclusive criminal jurisdiction over israelis in the occupied palestinian territories gaza meanwhile is part of the palestinian territories but has not been occupied since <number> which is not disputed by israel hence it would be my interpretation that at least as far as alleged crimes committed in gaza are concerned jurisdiction should not be precluded by oslo the application for arrest warrants against ministers netanyahu and gallant refer to alleged crimes committed in gaza,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFSkU0bUFZYmlIb0RXUHhPaGluTVQzR3NWOG5DbG5wMTZJZXZtRkkybkN3amhxWVE5N0k1M09wQjV4S3JsNEdoSWFWRTR4dkRnR3dtbHdOVTllNHF5RjJmUnplNDJLaWljN2ZKZXNNSDVyYmM9

under the oslo accords neither party can unanimously change its or the lands status independently or internationally meaning israeli cannot declare for example a zone land as belonging to israel cannot declare or change the determination of the land and legal situation palestine authority cannot declare independence or get international recognition of independence or declare lands as different status than what is agreed to this is a fundamental clause as the oslo accords were an agreement that allowed both sides to agree and build trust to later solve intractable issues icc in <number> mentioned that the issue of jurisdiction is an issue because most likely strictly speaking the oslo accords specifically deny that palestinian terroritiies are a state icc requires states that have sovereignty over a land to intervene additionally if palestine gaza is a state israel can ask palestine to actually behave like a state under international law and can be held liable for its citizens coming into israel and killing israelis not just oct <number> oslo accords havr a framework for how the two parties interact and solve issues that arent under standard international law claims,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFbDBEaVY2cTVEdFNVcW9wR0ttX2VITFRCLWVtMjg1bmlOSklwNlBSMThqWUZyLTVBQU81a3dMOThlRF80dWVsdmNYbEVUY1VUVHVtY0NYYklIVnVQOXc9PQ==

this is all mostly incorrect international law especially geneva convention as well as jus cogens norms provide the legal framework which gives much stronger and more robust protections than any agreement between palestinians and israelis moreover no such agreement can override rights under geneva conventions let alone jus cogens norms eg illegality of israeli annexation stems from jus cogens norms any agreement may simply reiterate this point but prohibition would still exist even without the agreement de jure sovereignty and practical ability to exercise that sovereignty are very different,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFWHMyR1RkSXo3QTFrbXVXQmJBeHI1VFdKNFB2c0dKOWdrUkYyQ2psZmVvZ0NJX2hZS1RIMTMyS1cta0REaTlITWlJblYweUxZaXNQLWtnMUt1TnRjZXc9PQ==
this will definitely slow down the process prosecutor will probably respond to these submissions and depending on how much time pretrial chamber devotes to this issue we may have to wait for the decision for a couple of months i certainly hope pretrial chamber will not reject the request on jurisdictional grounds as for their arguments this was already repeated when the pretrial chamber was deciding on jurisdiction to open investigation it seems that decision didnt entirely settle the point but there are very good reasons to think uk is wrong about this theyre essentially claiming that because oslo agreement stipulated palestinians would not have jurisdiction over israeli citizens they do not have that authority and thus cannot delegate it to icc as this article points out<url> and even an israeli scholar seems to agree there is a distinction between prescriptive jurisdiction to make law and enforcement jurisdiction bilateral agreements affect enforcement jurisdiction iccs jurisdiction stems from prescriptive one second problem is that this interpretation of oslo is incompatible with provisions of fourth geneva convention which requires high contracting parties to prosecute grave breaches and provides that any agreements with occupying power cannot deprive protected persons of benefits of the convention simply put palestinians cannot renounce the right to prosecute war crimes through an agreement with israel it should be noted that the specified provision of oslo which places citizens of another state entirely outside of the criminal jurisdiction of palestine is largely unheard of in any other modern context this is much broader than sofa agreements because it also applies to civilians no state unless it has been coerced would ever agree to anything similar its entirely the product of force its absurd to argue its a legal impediment to icc can you imagine a hypothetical scenario where nazi germany signed an agreement with eg norwegian authorities in <number> that prevented norway from prosecuting germans and germans then unironically referred to that agreement as a valid legal basis to prevent norwegians from trying them after the war,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFd2ZSMXAyOVdhbU5qOU14MnJRbkx3OUlPY000SnZWLV9QYlJHM0M0aFFpZkdfQnRBUENyWHB3VlQtZ2Q3STFNRDlOSmxFbzVQeUVaRXNnOElKRmJvbEE9PQ==
unsc tribunals could overcome this immunity icc ruled that it also can though the reasoning is dubious but its still much more reasonable than having no immunity from arrest by states >to me the legal distinction between domestic and international jurisdictions is a lot thinner than it seems why i can see the similarity between domestic jurisdiction and iccs pooling of jurisdiction lot of territorial and personal jurisdiction delegated to one institution but in case of icc you can make the argument given that majority of un states are party to it including entire europe entire south america and north america except us it does to some extent reflect the view of community of states maybe its a flawed argument but its a lot more reasonable than no immunity at all >of course the policy argument remains valid but policy arguments are subsidiary sources of interpretation personal immunity of heads of state just like immunity of diplomats exists for practical purposes,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFVE9mTmkwRXE1QkllcTdiNnB2YWpKYTZpRFBNUXNTNXNvcThsWXdKRkZyMTJ5OVNDcEsxUm82NS0ycEYybUIyMGxLZGVobGRYZXpZMlZyNUloMVU4Y0E9PQ==
what you said is irrelevant to the actual case at hand which is whether the icc has jurisdiction the icc can only intervene if asked by a state upon which the alleged crimes took place the icc ruled in <number> that they have yet to finalize whether or not palestine is a state as based on the oslo accords it is not and based on some international bodies it is the uk filing asks the court to rule on this jurisdiction issue the above is the legal case at hand below is more historical and speculative the consequences of palestine being a state without an agreement with israel depends on how israel responds israel coould assume that since a major clause is being violated the whole agreement is null additionally the purpose of the oslo accords was to grant security for israel in exchange for economicpolitical goals for palestinians remember pre oslo plo and the pa wasnt international recognized or was considered terroristic the pa as a governing body is not self sufficient without money coming from israel water from israel and from israels exportimport taxes and from international donors so its a big mess if all of a sudden palestine is a state that doesnt have borders doesnt have real income without external or israel support and its citizens,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFRXZRQU02aHNUWTU0QnhINEYtdU55MzdMcUI5WHkwQm1IMUZRN3FMYW5tWDdwY2VlM1kyd2ZBRXhWejVmOER1RFg2VUZkZG5KaHc3UFdsZE9HWVRRQXc9PQ==

thanks for clarifying a few things >thats not exactly correct court ruled that palestine is a state party to the statute the reasoning is somewhat complicated but icc didnt decide whether palestine was a state under general international law do you have an idea of what the uk injunction is asking for if this was already determined palestine is party to the statute why do they need to rule on whether its a state under international law my understanding is that >the only conceivable scenario where recognition by one particular state can be decisive is case of unilateral secession but thats not what is going in this case because israel has never claimed territory of state of palestine belongs to israel without diving into a rabbit hole the world recognizes israels borders of jordan egypt syria and they encompass whatever land palestine would claim in the west bank anyways its complicated but my assumption was that the oslo accords solidified and created actual land demarkations of who controls which territory a b c zones before and without this the land is just israeli territory under international law and israel is the occupying power over non demarcated lands no >this is horribly misleading its dependent in the sense that israel controls all of the listed and can block palestinians from accessing it but in principle state of palestine could be as selfsufficient as any average state can you clarify what is misleading <number><number> of tax revenues come from import and export duties israel collects and transfers to the pa this was setup in the paris accords the precurser to the oslo accords then the rest comes from international donors and from income tax israel withholds from the k palestinians that used to work in israel and then transfered to the pa,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFWTQxU3JRWWxTYmV4Z3VOX1owRUhpN2ZjOG4zTFkxRThQU0ZLanI0NlRHRm5DMTVsS1hUVWxkcGIwNG91NUg2WHktRVM0UURONTF6UHozVG1Zem1EelE9PQ==
i would add that the icc has previously ruled that its prescriptive jurisdiction isnt bound by that of the member states i believe its in the myanmarbangladesh case but dont quote me on that article <number> of the rome statute isnt constrained by the fact that for instance a state doesnt apply its criminal laws extraterritorially to its citizens this lends credibility to the argument that the icc isnt exercising a domestic jurisdiction as much as it is enable to enforce an international jus cogens one,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFLW81VnRKWUM4Wl9HbFkwRHlFSFBBWW9FUUVDWVd3dHB2WnBFR0NnbUJyU3hNOF9wR1l6ZXhjTHN0SWlNdnYyalNVNWNEZTZYOG9MQmgxMGRjUEhVcUE9PQ==
you are fundamentally misrepresenting the ratio decidendi of the ptc <number><number> decision they found that palestine had the legal capacity to ratify the rome statute and accept its jurisdiction and that this determination didnt require going into the montevideo criteria furthermore they deemed that evaluating the non quod argument was not pertinent at this stage which is what the uk is relying upon furthermore i find your logic here fundamentally flawed if the oslo accords do not recognize palestine as a state then it is not a treaty and it does not bind it it is at most an agreement imposed by an occupying force following the geneva conventions the operative instrument to the ptc was the un recognition of palestine as an observer state status which allowed it to participate to any open ratification treaty for whom the unsg was registrar i understand the uk wanting to make the oslo argument but it is relatively transparent that its a delaying mechanism and is not expected to succeed legally its a plausible argument but not a particularly strong one lastly i would remind you israel has been in noncompliance and even violation of the oslo agreements since before the turn of the millenium without repercussions lets not act as if there was much ground for grandstanding on that regard,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFQVVTbExXZHBhdUhMYVdJQkxlMDlVWHB4WlRwVWMtR0JUc2M1cWdzSTRwNnpMNmZ3NHVmb0JIYlJHVmFDclh4OFhDcjRFZUdrdWxjZzFGQ2VNamRja1E9PQ==
the uk is not contesting that palestine is member of the rome statute the appropriate time for that was within <number> months of palestine joining it is contesting it can exercise jurisdiction against israeli soldiers committing art <number> crimes in palestine essentially art of the rome statute provides that crimes occuring on the territory or by the national of a member state fall under the courts jurisdiction israel has signed but not ratified the statute so the latter one is out however normally crimes committed by israelis on palestinian territory would be under the jurisdiction what the uk is arguing here is that under the oslo accords palestine cannot exercise jurisdiction over israelis therefore it cannot delegate to the court a power it doesnt have itself as for internationally recognized borders israels are the <number> ones see icj wall advisory opinion the west bank east jerusalem and gaza are presently occupied by israel in contravention to international law this was also true before the oslo accords as states cannot gain territory by invasion under pil lastly i think op referred to your statements as misleading because this is money and resources that would be collected by the palestinian state otherwise israel isnt subsidising the occupied territories its just controlling their resources,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFVFM0LTdNN0tSYm1ZSkRvaEhqeVdrcF9QWXRuQzZDZ25PNHhhRWZiaFhCTjhjZ1NWTmVxQl9na3NIT0Rva211ZGtEc0dEWkVSUWprTHJDUVdwSzZhNGc9PQ==

ive left the icc close to a year now so things arent as fresh in my memory as they used to be apologies but essentially there is a shade of monism vs dualism in the debate international crimes whose prevention prohibition and punishment are jus cogens obligations do not technically need either prescriptive adjudicative or enforcement jurisdiction to be delegated by the states look for instance at the tadic interlocutory appeal on jurisdiction the fact they are universal jurisdiction or the fact the principle of legality is purely on the substantive law and not procedural law whatsoever al hassan not sure which decision on the top of my head some like kai ambos and especially carsten stahn argue that the icc is using a moderated form of this power and that ratifying the statute is accepting the competence of the icc to exercise complementarily this personal jurisdiction which stems purely from international law therefore what powers said state grants itself is only a selflimitation to its capacity to exercise jurisdiction on international crimes for instance look at most national laws regarding universal jurisdiction which ask for a link which is not required in pil this limitation would not impact the iccs own powers for others of course the icc is not a true international tribunal unlike the ictyictr i guess and therefore is only being delegated the domestic enforcement powers of the state im too tired to search but i think stahn has written an article on that subject in <number> or <number> in response to another author worth checking out it will be more legible than my tired second language can be of course to me the latter reading would also mean that personal immunities could apply here like in the icj drc immunity case as the logic would be fundamentally similar to that of the oslo accords blocking enforcement anyway i hope i wasnt too rambly,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFZHc4YWpmTDBWeVVfMjRRM0VzZVZUZ2NmcldHaEtSOFluZGgxQVU4NC1tQ1pUM05RQTRrb2NSWGptR05ndTg2VDZZV2U5QnVUVHpTMjdhT3l6S19CUnc9PQ==
utooobhoobs comment cover most of what ive would have said i would just like to emphasize a couple of points >the world recognizes israels borders of jordan egypt syria and they encompass whatever land palestine would claim in the west bank anyways its complicated >but my assumption was that the oslo accords solidified and created actual land demarkations of who controls which territory a b c zones before and without this the land is just israeli territory under international law and israel is the occupying power over non demarcated lands no no country israel included claims west bank is a part of israel they all maintain israels territory is within the green line jordan for example renounced territory west of river jordan when it signed a peace treaty with israel but that treaty doesnt say everything west of that river is israel just that its jordans western border only difference is that israel says occupied territories are disputed because theyre disputing palestine is a state but it would a very awkward dispute where only one state is actually claiming territory oslo accords didnt actually resolve any status issues they were supposed to be an interim agreement before a final settlement was reached the division of into zones is a technical security arrangement it does not grant any sovereignty ><number><number> of tax revenues come from import and export duties israel collects and transfers to the pa palestinians could collected taxes themselves the only reason theyre not is that israel wants to do that instead of palestinians,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFX2pVOXBiQkhnTnJhY0FQSWZOYURSMXFRR1Q4VURHMlcwWjg5T1F6eURRdFloYmZfZ2ZlT2RFWU1STEg3R3lweHlWY090MUZsNkwwRjNJalJSbU8wdGc9PQ==
>furthermore i find your logic here fundamentally flawed if the oslo accords do not recognize palestine as a state then it is not a treaty and it does not bind it this is a remarkably good point that is completely ignored by those who raise oslo accords as an obstacle to statehood international treaties can only be entered into between states and international organizations for oslo accords to be a treaty the other party would have to be a state but if oslo implicitly denies that palestine is a state then its a purely political agreement between two leaders thats not legally binding such an agreement cannot in any way be a hindrance to selfdetermination because its ultimately legally irrelevant,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFZGFqS3NSdVJCeXJnN19teW01QUx4bGhfX1pKeWZHWlI5a1JVRHlDd1h5Ukh5a05PeHhVR3JMdDZoa2NXc2FBNWdNdl9jSUs5eVlGMi1hRXhUVUFIaVE9PQ==

peremptory norms of international law and ius cogens are as far as im aware simply synonyms the icc has found the geneva conventions to be peremptory in at least al hassan probably more and most of both aps are as well as is agreed by the israeli sc in the targeted killings as well you raise very good points on the limits of ius cogens here but to me there is a distinction between the obligation to prosecute a case and the possibility to do so for an easy example its not because grave violations of the gc are universal jurisdiction crimes that there is an obligation under the law of state responsibility to prosecute all war criminals even on your territory if a war criminal is on your territory and another state wants to prosecute then its aut dedere aut judicare what im driving at is that states can give the icc the authority to excercise a similar kind of international jurisdiction as was started with the imt and continued with the ictyictr this jurisdiction coming from the fact these norms are universal and erga omnes partes this would not be because or limited to cases where the state has the obligation to prosecute a certain case under the laws of state responsibility anyway im mainly incoherent at this point of the evening but i found the stahn article<url> i was talking about i hope youll enjoy it edit personal immunities are fundamentally a jurisdictional issue as the icj established in the arrest warrants case if the oslo accords poses a jurisdictional bar im not sure why immunities wouldnt of course this is not my point in fact an argument ab absurdo,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFREZHLUtOTlpfTS1VNkp6ek9ha29panhxS1Vuczg3MEhUVWNVWDk1MV9aaWk1RUhwRUlOc1dLT09DTGZNUmFEVDg5LXNQOUp0ZjhUNUkxWFB4RE9qcVE9PQ==
no it does not ukraine has full jurisdiction over its territory so it is undoubtedly free in transferring jurisdiction the important question in the present matter is if palestine can transfer rights that are not its own as the oslo accords stipulate that palestine may not prosecute israelis for crimes committed in palestine,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFanBudk93NzRMcWtNY3V6TUQwbzVSNWo4d0ZYYmU4TjBDc1V1RTJYZ1pFSnh4TW5RT0owSnRRNnFGUzlYVzFmaElhS0xCR1RMbTBXZFUxU2I1eUdVTFp1UWViSENXbk9ENmVabGJLc0NhN3M9

thank you for sharing that article it is excellent unsurprising given its author the text of the statute seems to favor a universalist reading article <number><number> for example says that a state which becomes a party to this statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the court the use of the word accept implies that the courts jurisdiction exists independently of a states accession to the statute the state does not grant or vest the court with jurisdiction that it otherwise would not have it consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction that the court inherently possesses the title of article <number> preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction suggests the same thing state accession to the rome statute is necessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction but it is not related to the existence of that jurisdiction similarly article <number> says that the courts powers include exercising its jurisdiction rather than possessing it and that the courts jurisdiction shall be governed rather than created or granted by the rome statute this language seems to reflect a recognition that as stahn puts it the act of accession to the statute merely activates the power of the icc to exercise a jurisdiction grounded in international law,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFb2FlRlMycWs3UWhmQ3F2bWJFUkgyVnlIRnkweFVkYUFFTzZJUnR0aDRFVTlVRExncHJuMmxXbmVNRXdHQ0ZObFFHNkVla1FST3lVdVdUVHZOUEQ0R1E9PQ==
if you can rephrase this in a more neutral way the post will be approved humanitarian organizations are not refusing to distribute aid they have paused distribution while they conduct a security review of their operations a post about refusing to distribute aid will create arguments about who is refusing to do what and why rather than answers to the legal question which is the international legal obligations of humanitarian aid organizations,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFV1pUWXk3ZUpmOTV3aVgzNmtHR0t1d1NYUFBaMFUxUE5aa2hnQ1N6MGFSUDlSS3JTeG1vcGZUanJEcm13WHRzNm4tV0J3eENsQkp6SWtxWGlncDJuVWc9PQ==

>the title of article <number> preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction suggests the same thing thats a very interesting detail i didnt really pay much attention to it when reading the statute its a very unusual phrasing and clearly indicates jurisdiction is already there but the statute imposes additional conditions on its exercise this interpretation also means uks objections are invalid because icc already has jurisdiction and it can be exercised for all crimes on territory of a state party regardless of any bilateral agreements,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSHFWRGlXbXVtUzQ3RFJwNlVnU204TjdQdW5NaVJfVHRtV21GM0V4UGNoVVpyY180MU1oSnVqd2F2Z0E0aTVMVk9EV3VXUnlGTTk4dXVPZHVEaWZ3cXc9PQ==

thanks for the explanations basically spain is saying if there is no direct evidence of genocide inferred intent should be considered genocide however this seems like if the evidence isnt there right on procedure is there any method to counter such claims with the mountain of evidence pointing to contrary conclusions is the bar for genocide as low as these claims make it out to be for example actual genocide doesnt need to occur but the inferred intent of indirect evidence of it occuring is enough to convict seems unreasonable,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGNHdGYTFyZzNrZlZwdWFydlNxNlZQSHJLZC1jUXhjX2VBYWtQa0h1RlJBRVVkczdzNGZlenpVY3JBQmV3V2JtSW9TNkh0amtQRU9VYVZoVTlGTGhGbVE9PQ==
there is a litany of misapprehensions here that must be addressed let me start with the last point >actual genocide doesnt need to occur but the inferred intent of indirect evidence of it occuring is enough to convict seems unreasonable this is a complete misunderstanding of the law on genocide if there is inferred genocidal intent then the requirement contained in chapeau of article ii that there must be intent is met if there is inferred genocidal intent plus the commission of any one of the prohibited article ii acts then actual genocide has taken place that is the law >spain is saying if there is no direct evidence of genocide inferred intent should be considered genocide this is a mischaracterisation of the intent tests this is not the rule spain invented but the one the icj has held to be applicable there are two ways to prove genocidal intent <number> direct evidence failing which <number> indirect inferred evidence based on the alleged perpetrators pattern of conduct >is there any method to counter such claims with the mountain of evidence pointing to contrary conclusions a misunderstanding of what the evidence is about if theres an allegation that a government official said or did not say something then that official either did or did not say it if theres evidence of a pattern of conduct or behaviour either the perpetrators did or did not commit those acts the question is whether one interprets that evidence to demonstrate either direct or indirect evidence of genocidal intent >is the bar for genocide as low as these claims make it out to be there is a bare majority among legal scholars that the bar for finding inferred genocide intentthe only inference testis too high not too low others think that the bar is set just right almost no serious international lawyer thinks that the bar is set too low,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGd242bWZGZkh5TGQ2LWFEZE5qU0dEMWhUNzc2ZzBkZVpoeEtFWDRkZmdKYlAwd2JPNEZtYlUxZ3l4REdOVTNBeW4xQ19td09wdlFqUmV5eV9CTHQxb0FMdFlOQlQzYmUxYUhRMnhfUmxHbEU9
what i am trying to ask or understand is is there positive evidence that matches the test that genocide isnt occuring i understand that there can be inferred evidence and legal tests to determine if genocide is occuring for example some israeli leaders for the first two weeks after oct <number> said they would blockade all of gaza this is the negative evidence against israel to claim genocide the remaining <number> months of war israeli leaders havent stated they will blockade gaza is there a standard of positive evidence that genocide isnt occuring or only negative evidence rules and tests,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGdVBVcU1iZklYX3VDaUt0V2ZxU3dXQUU1M3BRVEZOTHlCTkdOOUZEZDZ2aTExWF91MDBTY2dITkJpejN0bEtrbVNjZnotZDMtdjNzc0NnY0l6UG9ENkE9PQ==

>basically spain is saying if there is no direct evidence of genocide inferred intent should be considered genocide thats not what spain is saying inferring dolus specialis is not a new concept and isnt disputed by anyone making inferences is a basic judicial function that at the icj dates back to the courts first case corfu channel in croatia v serbia the court explained that it can only infer dolus specialis if genocidal intent is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence spains arguments develop on that statement of law it makes two main points in para <number> of its declaration first it says that the only reasonable inference analysis applies only between inferences that are reasonably supported by the evidence in other words the alternative inference must have some factual basis in the evidence before the court second it notes that the only reasonable inference analysis has been applied to patterns of conduct but not to other evidence of dolus specialis and says that the analysis should not be applied to other evidence >is there any method to counter such claims with the mountain of evidence pointing to contrary conclusions the court weighs the evidence before it >actual genocide doesnt need to occur but the inferred intent of indirect evidence of it occuring is enough to convict seems unreasonable this statement seems to be confused genocide is an act prohibited by the genocide convention perpetrated with dolus specialis these elements of genocide can be established through indirect evidence or through direct evidence you are implying that without direct evidence there can be no actual genocide that is not correct because there is no inherent difference in credibility or reliability between direct and indirect evidence indirect evidence requires a factfinder to make an inference which is why the only reasonable inference analysis is so important but there is no legal reason that a finding of dolus specialis cannot be made on the basis of indirect evidence the same is true for the prohibited act,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGQ1p3VDBlQlhwNWxnQW1Rd055TlJpLU96Z3c5M21YMEFXUXYyLVdRTHNWZ3pSWGZLaWdERlZMTERfaEhNVXhSUm11YW1NUkJldXZfUkk4V2hUaXBKcFE9PQ==
i dont see how israel can be found not guilty of a b and c of article <number> does it matter which member of government makes the genocidal statements does it matter that someone like ben gvir isnt part of the war cabinet and therefore doesnt have any impact on the actions the idf takes in the war in rwanda those who operated the rtlm radio were convicted of incitement to genocide as it could be reasonably considered that they knew their actions would be acted upon arguably this could apply to someone like ben gvir,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGalZ3cDRsRkZXdVhyYl91ZjdxMmxyR3J4VERDSmo1bmVSUnJ1UXJ4elFIOTFUcUtwU2dNODA5R1pKVmJJaE54YUNSVW9Td1h3Z1dkT3l4elNXM1lfYkE9PQ==

the short answer is yes the more the senior official the more likely they can be seen as speaking on behalf of the state alternatively it also depends on which article ii acts one alleged have happened the closer the nexus between a statement to the act the more probative and consequential the officials statements so for example if a government minister who isnt part of the war cabinet makes genocidal statements assume for the sake of this example that this was the intent and is involved behind the scenes in blocking aid trucks from entering gaza then there could be a sufficiently close nexus between such a statement and acts that may be genocidal other statements may still constitute incitement but that falls under article iii failure to prevent or punish incitement incurs state responsibility article iv also makes clear that >persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in article iii shall be punished whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers public officials or private individuals,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGLS12SWFSUDZCVnpsUDE3Z0tDMDJ0UXYzX3pvUXdiRkhwbHQ3Q1d6U0ZPb1BGbTF3SEtySWVuU0J2ZG42NjR2bXNaeUdXdVhmZVdGWjYwN0o1eDJZMEhra2NqOW5BdV9FWmdlR0RiRnU3cWM9
this is incorrect south africa has the burden of proving its claims that israel violated the genocide convention including article ii which you should read any suggestion otherwise is a falsehood,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGRTBfbkJlallzQWdfSWNlUU0xTzRyakkxdklFckFhMlluVGgyUHZ2dUs1Y1JsXzVFaERxc0hyTXliRV9RQnF5b3hCX2ZLTi1kY2paMUJpNEdwYk14dC0wZVVFU2h6cDlTYWhGOEVjWnh4WU09
the icj is not a criminal court so it does not find guilt or innocence rather it determines state responsibility you misunderstand the burden of proof at the icj the burden of proof typically lies with the party asserting a claim a party asserting a violation of a treaty has the burden of proving that claim a party asserting a fact has the burden of proving that fact it is beyond the scope of a reddit thread to explain how evidence and burdens of proof work at the icj if you want to learn about these issues there are plenty of articles about them like this one <url>,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGNFdMX0sxZGYyV0thejFMTTVNeXlMTTdTS3puanlMMUdnbHBLaWRqdTBvMDhaUFF0UEVWcEM1U0hhQkVWNFAyUUV6Zk1zUzUzTzhqY1dSbC1TcEpVZ2c9PQ==
thanks for answering that clears a lot up is it still necessary that the person has a reasonable expectation that their words may be carried out eg if ben gvir says we should kill all palestinians can they argue genocidal statement made was actually hyperbole im just trying to get my head around how ministers can make genocidal comments and they go uncontested and to what extent a government can separate its policy making from the actions of a rogue minister,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGZnB2RnNhY0xXNzc3NXh2cEptYXI4WnB4TUFOS1praTBfNWM5WllzNW1FVWxDaEItUkVJbmE4empRNko4blh0VWJnU2xZdkZ5bWM2M0ZScmxUbTJoU0E9PQ==

> the short answer is yes the more the senior official the more likely they can be seen as speaking on behalf of the state i think it would also depend on how the state handles the statements for instance if an executive official makes genocidal statements and is fired that should be taken as strong evidence that is not the states position on the other hand if theres no means to terminate the position say its a random legislator and your country has no viable expulsion method condemnation should be considered sufficient,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGTmZQNmN3dmVkZE1OeWZ4SmxTMnNsWk1TNzBuVE1fay1FZnVhdGNweDBJRjRCYlc3SHpYQllkOVM0RnNRWkRhN3daR2c2ZW5sdHVTVGtNX2xTOEJTYXc9PQ==

this is not correct genocide requires a prohibited act perpetrated with the requisite intent the prohibited act is typically not difficult to show so discussions tend to focus on intent but both elements are necessary,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGdW5lSzJXOEtpYkZ2d3NFVE02WktUVFVNUGhldV9qelZINEk3VWR1V3hDWU9FQUVEVmRVa1NsaGFHdUo2UENJc1dqdl9WTnpjYWxXanlLNmVjdXM3SXc9PQ==
so i a practicing lawyer have read the genocide convention and im very confused by how intent can be proven by indirect evidence for example here are the five enumerated acts a killing members of the group b causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group c deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part d imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group e forcibly transferring children of the group to another group i would argue that either <number> or <number> occurs in almost any conflict zone but of course they must be committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group im not clear what indirect evidence could turn acts <number> and <number> from acts of war to acts of genocide hypothetically lets say that the south africans submit evidence that the idf destroyed x of a city in gaza the idf responds with evidence that their strike successfully eliminated x of militants in that city would that be indirect evidence of genocide or direct evidence of war its clear the direct evidence does not point to genocide but presumably the south africans would claim the direct evidence is a pretext for genocide and therefore indirect evidence must be used how can israel defend itself in a situation like this,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGeV9SZ24xblNDUlA0MUlHRm01WWU5SjlQUE5McTBLZ0lBSEo4Y0xKcERyU3BicDdRQzAxMlU4WmpmTTJlZl9lN3N0cFZodVo5eFF6ZWZRR2U1ZkJEX2c9PQ==
i wonder if you as a practising lawyer bothered to look at the judgments ive directed you to read based on your questions i doubt so the direct and indirect evidence does not concern the acts but the intent its direct or indirect evidence spoken of concerns allegations of genocidal intent not the acts further any indirect evidence of genocidal intent must be gleaned from a pattern of conduct such that the only reasonable inference can be that the perpetrator intended to destroy in whole or in part such a group that in addition to asking you to start reading the case law should provide you with the answers you need,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHM3hIdkdZUmFTeUdfemdoZXlheUt1UWd4WTROZ2YzR05DS1VsUjJ1VVhkX1E1TGlGRkFRbVk0VEtibWtfNHJ5ZlFwYWJiRUVkZVRrM2ZlVHBGNkVKbEhXV1FDdjdwbGxCMlVVN0J5MzBQeFU9
brother i did read those cases and neither are specific enough to indicate that the icj employs any consistency across these questions the bosnia case points out that finding specific intent requires great care and then just reiterates the elements required for intent and then goes into the specifications for ethnic cleansing which is a lesser charge but a finding of ethnic cleansing can be dispositive on the question of genocide so if indirect evidence is found for ethnic cleansing would that suffice as indirect evidence for genocide the only instruction provided is that great care must be taken as a defense lawyer if i were representing israel how would i prepare for the inevitable finding of indirect intent to commit acts of genocide for example above youve indicated that any statements by any member of the israeli government whether they are involved in prosecuting the war or not could be indirect evidence of genocide perhaps its not enough for genocide at the outset but is sufficient for a finding of intent to commit ethnic cleansing that is now used as indirect evidence of intent to commit an act of genocide how could i counter that were i defending israel what direct evidence could i cite in my defense,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHWGhqTnF2VUs5dmJmZlVyQk5JbXBDcjVfQ1prdHhfWDBOLXBLWnRuZWlUR3FnV1phWV96emNyS0YyWVIwa0dXeFdEWHAzV19naXZ0S2ZZajVaNmNZR3c9PQ==
my sense of this is that south africa and its supporters will need to lean heavily on direct evidence through public statements by israeli officials because israel has a plausible difficult to rebut response to the indirect evidence in the context of war many wars which no one has considered calling a genocide have had comparable<url> civilian to military death ratios even accepting the worst case<url> numbers at face value of course the response to this will likely be that israel has intentionally limited its genocidal acts to avoid public censure the icty appellate division in the krstic appeal made a similar observation > in determining that genocide occurred at srebrenica the cardinal question is whether the intent to commit genocide existed while this intent must be supported by the factual matrix the offence of genocide does not require proof that the perpetrator chose the most efficient method to accomplish his objective of destroying the targeted part even where the method selected will not implement the perpetrators intent to the fullest leaving that destruction incomplete this ineffectiveness alone does not preclude a finding of genocidal intent the international attention focused on srebrenica combined with the presence of the un troops in the area prevented those members of the vrs main staff who devised the genocidal plan from putting it into action in the most direct and efficient way constrained by the circumstances they adopted the method which would allow them to implement the genocidal design while minimizing the risk of retribution but it would be a strange genocide indeed where the perpetrator intended the annihilation of substantial numbers of the protected group risked international condemnation to kill them from the air but then stopped short of killing them on the ground those levying the genocide accusation against israel cant have it both ways israel cant be both so bloodthirsty that it is willing to ignore international censure to carry out a campaign of genocide before the watching eyes of the world but so restrained that it has declined to carry out systematic killings within its effective zone of control ultimately i think there is a another reasonable inference to draw from this set of facts israeli leaders intended the destruction of hamas a political unprotected group and recklessly disregarded the impact on civilians this may be morally reprehensible in a variety of ways but it isnt specific intent,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHOEFlczhJNUgydXRZcU5oTnY2WWtVS01MOFBUU3RPOFRlUlNTTElPdnhEcnZMUnRsTE5CVkNjOHlSQzIwYkpnTmNOeGRWd1AyLThfQWVUVDBxTmpJWEE9PQ==

the burden of proof south africa must meet is proving its allegations concerning any violations of the genocide convention or other rules of international law semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit if youre asking about the standard of proof that must be met you can read the two cases ive cited the icj explained what needs to be proved in the case of direct evidence as well as the actus reus of articles ii and iii violations in the case of indirect evidence of genocidal intent the standard is blindingly obvious from reading the case law and spains full written interventiononly reasonable inference,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHWWRLUFd5aGFEWmY1TXNDZTM1QTVpNlNKRUVwMG5nME54elNtVGdzS3I3Z1ZKS1lfektIekxvZVJUVzFvd0o1VjgzdFo5eWRGd2I1cnp3ZTFjRGlNc1VVaDZxSF9JbC1uSndHTmxJZFBKbjQ9
it is difficult believe you cannot imagine any evidence that would support an inference of dolus specialis almost anything other than statements of intent would be indirect evidence it is equally difficult to believe you cant imagine how a party to a lawsuit might respond to indirect evidence it can dispute the credibility and reliability of the evidence it can formulate other inferences that the court could make from the evidence it would offer contradictory evidence in short it could do all the things that parties do in the exceedingly common event that they have to address circumstantial evidence of something,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHU0RRSkQ2LVN5UHF5aFluNm5iTVYzUGMtSXdrMkxSXzdqWmhIYTlmMGQ2N08wZjFWZ2dVd1Z4Rjd2Yk9JV2VtWjB3TF9pNnp3a2VjV2ZNTWxoSnJ2Mnc9PQ==
can you clarify what youre asking the title of your post asks if eighteen is the age of majority under customary international law the body of the post asks if trying children as adults or not affording adequate protections to children violates the convention on the rights of the child or customary international law thats five questions the one in the title and then <number> trying children as adults and <number> not affording adequate protections as violations of crc and custom the answer to all five is it depends so being more specific will help you get a helpful answer,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNclZYTkZnTGlYamxFNmJ1eFRJV1F5aU5sZEwxRmdxUG1McllaVlNKdHYxRmpMQk1IelFKTGV1Mzc4RjBXaXZWZmJ3MXE3RF96UG1udEJqWHVsb1o4UFE9PQ==
i edited the description and removed the additional questions the main question essentially is if the age <number> is cil and would a state be in violation of cil if they juridically treat someone under <number> as an adult and dont provide them with addequate protections,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNUGFySk0takRFWVdPM2psc1psYXMyY093eUw1azg5cGU5ZFc0XzZrZnhkaHdpUWxOOW9fUXpfUTFqTlNuRmx6ZHlYcjFiR3dMSmJ3dHNBMDdYWFJ4T3c9PQ==
thats two questions each of which must be addressed in turn >if the age <number> is cil what widespread and consistent state practice that occurs out of a sense of legal obligation shows that the age of majority is eighteen no more no less the crc does not because article <number> sets a maximum age of majority but permits states to set a lower age under national law so it becomes a matter of analyzing state practice there is no shortcut here you have to look at as many states as possible what they do and why they do it >if they juridically treat someone under <number> as an adult and dont provide them with addequate protections it depends if a person is a child then all but a few states owe them the obligations laid out in the crc you would need to show that some or all of those obligations are also customary in that case trying a child as an adult could violate those obligations but it would not necessarily do so,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNbG5mYXNyYjVxQ2lFa2lFbTRueV82OXphSGkzNFZTRGNLQkRFSnFNcjJoUXpickRnRElBY095WmFDLWNEMzJNM0llT1o1cDY1Y2tkdEM0Z3FTS3lYSGc9PQ==
for a customary rule to exist there must be more than consistent practice there needs to be opinio juris which basically means that states are acting out of the belief that international law requires them to act in that specific way in the case of the age of majority you have the first element but you do not have the second states who have decided that majority would begin at <number> have not done because they felt they had an obligation to do so i dont remember any statements about this so they have done so based on policy decisions so no there is no cil in that area,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNVWY0MEd2YVU0T0c1TWhNTGhjd0NGU2xhR2hTcWozZF9NaXV6d3QtcFVoUWphZGhVaHV5MEEyNEo3X0FHUTJMZnRhNWEwSXZtbFBITHZZb21VRWlBVUE9PQ==

the genocide convention does not create obligations for nonstates parties the prohibition on genocide is a jus cogens norm which binds all states but that is not a consequence of the provisions of the convention and does not depend on the convention the termination or suspension of treaties is regulated by section <number> of the vienna convention on the law of treaties vclt article <number> says that termination and suspension are only possible as a result of the application of the provisions of a treaty of the provisions of the vclt deciding genocide isnt an issue is not a ground for termination or suspension under the genocide convention or the vclt the only possible argument otherwise would be to argue that such a decision was subsequent agreement or practice under article <number> of the vclt but it would be exceptionally weak at best,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQeUhOSk1sdlprTlpyT0JrOUdPd1JGeXFyMHVKb2pvRnBhSFR1cDVXRkdUeGE4RkRXVWdFX1pjSEI2eGE1bE8wN1o0ZWlGbjJjNVI2TUZOck10MEVYSUE9PQ==
this was my intuition as well after reading vclt again recently i wonder if the reason why various treaty bodies exist is to keep state parties engaged with treaties by requiring reporting btw when i said obligations to non state parties i meant states having obligations towards non state parties such as to protect them in this case from genocide,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQdzhnZHRERkVuMG81d1FjcHlsNDBwRkJVRWVmTEt4Z0VJVFBTMjZsZk1DTlExeExVNDZuX0UzeXZnd051NDBHamZzV3h2cEE5ZmNqdDBSdk53UzdVU0E9PQ==
>i meant states having obligations towards non state parties such as to protect them that is not an obligation owed to nonstates parties under the genocide convention the convention obligates states parties to prevent and punish genocide prevention and punishment are not the same thing as protection and in any event there is no obligation to protect states from genocide because states are not a protected group under the convention any such obligation would be to protect groups entitled to protection under the convention not to protect states that are not parties to the convention,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQeks0SWRSNnBwNm01elZGVElCYjNqcmZXTGF4S29ENEUwbEEyNnBEbGRhUWpQWGlPaHR2ZWI4cE5OcFpUVkJNb0VUR0R4N21UcGlKVXZvVm03cWl2TlE9PQ==

the answer depends very much on the importance of that soldier in the context of the war efforts of their country there is no black and white answer in my opinion also it would be extremely unlikely that a state would target the average soldier of another belligerant state that is taking holidays in a third state it would not be unlikely to do so against a high profile military official and thats why they usually dont take holidays in a third state while theyre at war,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRkhHNjA3d0ZfRXBnYW9vSVhSYUk5eGtER2NNdHZDOXFneUFlUlhQZDk5RERpbG4zcUtVOVhNMTc2X0JqRUN1czg5UFpPMkhkYklGdmtWZldFZXFSdVE9PQ==

this makes a lot more sense but how does consensus develop on various provisions if theres no state practice on specific provisions thats one big issue with non exhaustive provisions,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelZsdGtrYmxDQ3diYnJfd0ZKdC11WU14V184cHc0NktxblBLcGxEM3VfaWotckdoSTRIS0k4QnlFQllXMXZyT2JFazNqSTJVVFJqTWgxcEpmUjRudkE9PQ==
there can be state practice in relation to nonexhaustive provisions just because conduct isnt directly and explicitly prohibited by a treaty does not mean a state cannot express its opinion that that conduct does not violate the treaty,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabVBPQ1VtMFlOWkpMenczcjZmaTlQOE9VS1JSUkk4eVJBOHVTRFZQV1B0WmQ4aXlKWEtTLWJ1c2tKTVc3ejNVQ044M2lZam1tUGI1Wm9ocWVrXzltYUE9PQ==
soldiers are not out of conflict members of the armed forces of a party to an international armed conflict that are not hors de combat are military targets under ihl no matter where they are located an attack on a military target is lawful if it complies with the provisions of ihl that apply to attacks namely the principles of necessity proportionality distinction and humanity,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSVlsWTFiZWNiRE9HRG9WODZ1ZWs5cHJqVzctV2ZlRmtVSHV0VmJSNUw3YTFUdzcwUTBjb0s4UW9EUHJvcjJScXdkNW8wUUEwX0FjTWx3NW4xbktpcXc9PQ==

i dont know what you mean by protection under international law so its impossible to answer an ambiguous question precisely protection from what exactly preface i am not going to give you the definitions of the specific terms and phrases you will have to do the work and look it up for yourself because im only interested in addressing the specific issue of territorial scope as a general rule there are some geographical limits to applying ihl and the specific reaches of ihl differ between international and noninternational armed conflicts iacs and niacs one must also keep in mind the law of neutrality an entirely distinct area of international law that is nevertheless closely related to ihl especially when defining the latters geographical scope however such a general rule must also be reconciled with the principle of effectiveness which when applied in armed conflicts means that ihl applies whenever and wherever an act of belligerency crossing the threshold occurs in iac the principle of unity of territory applies ihl to all territories under the belligerent parties control the same rule also applies to cobelligerents this principle was stated by the icty in tadic decision on defence motion for interlocutory appeal on jurisdiction it<number><number>ar <number> october <number> <number> >at least some of the provisions of the conventions apply to the entire territory of the parties to conflict not just to the actual vicinity of the hostilities certainly some of the provisions are clearly bound up with the hostilities and the geographical scope of those provisions should be so limited others particularly those relating to the prisoners of war and civilians are not so limited robert kolb and richard hyde also pointed out in their book on the law of armed conflicts that ihl also applies in areas with actual hostilities or to relationships between belligerents outside the territory of the belligerents in other words the territorial applicability of ihl depends on the contents of the specific provisions invoked hence my question again is protection from what in niacs the issue is a bit more complex the general rule of territorial unity also applies according to akayesu judgment ictr <number><number>t <number> september <number> <number> ap ii applies >irrespective of the exact location of the affected person in the territory of the state engaged in the conflict similarly common article <number> must be applied in the whole territory of the state engaged in the conflict akayesu cites tadic as an authority so a reasonable reading of the dictum suggests that ihl applies only to territory under the belligerent parties control now the question is can ihl apply extraterritorially in niacs that will depend in large part on the specific identities of the person in question because as a general rule ihl as applicable in niacs applies to persons and objects rather than places see eg apii article <number><number> kayishema and ruzindana judgment ictr<number><number>t <number> may <number> <number> on leaders of nonstate armed groups the general consensus is that they are lawful targets due to their involvement in the hostilities but other restrictions on ihl such as the principle of proportionality etc remain applicable sandesh sivakumaran the law of noninternational armed conflict oup <number> p <number> on the law of neutrality without going too much into the weeds ihl does not apply to neutral states that are not involved in iacs and the same overwhelmingly applies to territories not involved in niacs if it does then wherever and whenever an armed conflict begins it creates a global battlefield simply by a combatant travelling out of the belligerent parties territories and nothing more such an application of ihl is clearly absurd the law of neutrality limits the geographical reach of ihl still it is also contingent on states seeking to maintain a neutral status to take steps to do so such as repelling the entry of belligerents tldr the answer isnot straightforward,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNW5lcm9KMEJLNC00bG0yeTZBazVUU1Fka3NKclJ2dTE4MVU5SlVYT2FCY1J1OEotWERkNVBtQmcyTGFMRmQxemkxaVpnSmt6eXZsckUwQ0tfTW5JeGxJSE9rSW9sYVFjQ2hUQVk4blcxb0E9
there isnt a specific source because its an application of international humanitarian law there is nothing that specifically says that a combatants location does not afford them special protections but if an attack doesnt violate ihl then it is lawful uaccidentaljurist mentioned neutrality in their comment and that is another issue that could have an impact here i didnt think of it because your question focused on protections afforded to combatants and neutrality isnt really that it is an obligation states owe to parties to a conflict so its good that someone else caught it,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOTBQWXQ0eVJqWmRDRmRsaHl0NEQxM1hLSEdrT1NmMWp1RjBzeE1TNDV1Tkc3dTU3b3diLVBMODVfZkx0b2RiVU5HS3hHcUR4c3RLeXB1SmhISUVmalE9PQ==

one thing i wonder is if the interpretation of a treaty can change from its intended design for example the lawful sanctions clause was added upon the request of an iranian and american delegate i think and it seems to have been accepted without much reluctance which seems to be evidence that they intended to leave the scope of article <number> out of domestic legislation but it seems like overtime through state party acceptance of various general comments and reports by special rapporteurs the clause has become narrowed to mean sanctions permissible under international law,r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSzhlWWYzM2wtZWUyUkNPdDhuQ1d1cDVNcVV4YWRudi1xMFd1bUg1T3daZldTNGluU09LeFZYY0czWWh0UzlWOFQxYXA4NlBoRC1Tb0VjSGpSQklfT0E9PQ==
