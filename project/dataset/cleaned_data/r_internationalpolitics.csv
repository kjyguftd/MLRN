i keep hearing how israel is conducting genocide against the palestinians one of israels characteristics is that militarily they are very good at accomplishing their objectives they defeated the arabs multiple times even though they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned they took out the iraqi nuclear reactor and have killed multiple terrorist leaders in pinpoint strikes they have a long history of doing the impossible however for some reason they have been completely incompetent at genocide when israel was founded in <number><number> there were about <number> palestinians today that number is around <number> now call me crazy but how a country known for its military capabilities can be this incompetent is beyond me unless of course they are not trying to carry out genocide after all hamas is doing what some japanese troops did on okinawa rather than allow civilians to flee they pulled them into the caves when us forces were forced to use explosives and flamethrowers to kill the japanese troops they also found dead women and children hamas uses hospitals schools and mosque to serve as weapons caches rocket firing platforms and fighting positions if hamas cared for the people of gaza they would not have spent millions on building tunnels and rockets they would not have trained to kill israelis and would be working to make peace egypt jordan and others who fought have made peace there are no rocket attacks from those places and no israeli bombs falling on their cities hamas knows that civilian deaths help their cause as it has done throughout the conflict they know useful idiots will march and protest calling on israel to stop well it looks like this time hamas jumped the shark and israel has decided its better to rip the band aid off bleed and cauterize the would that continue to suffer a thousand small cuts regardless if you want to the bombs to stop falling release the hostages and surrender,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSEx0YXUxQkZhd1lwcXlsOTUxanEwWUJoUEZhbF9HeTg3dk40ckJOaGtvcWR4czdaWjRJbW5sTllSOUtoT3FEbkZtQ1BOWVIzMmRyRnVxQ3lSdnE2ZXc9PQ==

answer <number> the claim that hamas uses civilians as human shields is supported by multiple sources including testimonies and reports from conflict zones independent investigations in conflict zones are challenging and the lack of verification does not disprove the claim the complexity of urban warfare often makes it difficult to gather concrete evidence answer <number> while amnesty international did not find conclusive evidence in their specific investigations this does not fully negate the possibility of such practices conflicts in densely populated areas create situations where militants operate within civilian zones complicating independent assessments answer <number> the documented use of palestinians as human shields by the israeli army is condemned and has been ruled illegal by israels high court however acknowledging this practice does not absolve hamas of similar accusations both parties must adhere to international laws answer <number> the continuous documentation by btselem of the israeli militarys use of human shields is critical and highlights serious violations however this does not mean hamas does not engage in similar practices each party must be scrutinized and held accountable independently answer <number> the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants is fundamental in international humanitarian law both sides must distinguish between combatants and civilians israels actions are often a response to threats embedded within civilian areas complicating the distinction answer <number> international law protects civilians even those allegedly used as human shields both parties in the conflict have obligations to minimize civilian harm violations by one side do not justify similar actions by the other but the operational realities of urban conflict often make these protections challenging to uphold fully hamas main tactics is the use of human shields unlike the idf,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVENBVm5BQTBRMzFxSEVIMDQ5bjdOM1NyQUdsTS04Y2xhWko3VWdkWlc0Sk9xcTJnLVFNUkhoSlcxRUhZeDlobEh6NWZrNDI2TTNxVjRBUTlNaEt5eWE3Ulc0aW5SVnlCbWFJQVFjRUNURlU9

well if you read what happened at the music festival as witnessed by multiple individuals israeli helicopters unfortunately killed some innocent civilians while taking out hamas terrorists unless the target is out in the open alone or surrounded by other terrorists even the best of the best cannot prevent innocents even their own getting killed there is no contradiction hamas purposely hides among civilians and in civilian infrastructure they place weapon caches and rocket launchers in or near civilian buildings to prevent israel from hitting them or getting sympathy from the useful idiots in the west if they do imagine if hamas has warned the kibbutz they were going to attack them as israel does before they bomb building if you want to know who hamas really is go see what the son of one of the founders has to say about them he has a much better understanding of what and who they are than you do you better hope and pray israel never feels they are about to be wiped out they take never again very seriously if that day ever comes just as samson did they are taking the temple down with them,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZExJMkRXYUl0UkYyQkN1dVZweHdUdUU0Q0ljSWY4VW91bUtPazRBNEVsSkp3NUNVNlpHNGpZOHpjaVFKTDR6Smw4eHN0ZDNicENhV3hSY1BmMy14bXc9PQ==

info for you how the peace talks are going thus far timeline how netanyahu thwarted every prisoner exchange deal quds news network friday july <number> <number> > anyone following the news of the prisoner exchange deal talks can see that it has become clear that israels benjamin netanyahu has been repeatedly thwarting efforts to secure prisoner exchange deals with the resistance despite various attempts to facilitate these exchanges and several approvals by the resistance movements led by hamas netanyahus actions have consistently led to delays and complications the following timeline provides a look at how netanyahus decisions and strategic leaks have derailed progress on multiple occasions raising questions about the underlying personal motives which have turned the lives of the palestinian people and israeli prisoners alike into a political game january <number> <number> netanyahu cancels the outcomes of the preparatory meetings for the first paris meeting without coordinating with the israeli war council or the israeli negotiating team and tightens israels stance january <number> <number> netanyahu delays granting authorization to the israeli negotiating team and postpones the first paris meeting the qatari foreign ministry spokesperson majed alansari publicly criticized him for the first time in a tweet if the reported remarks are found to be true the israeli pm would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives including israeli hostages he said instead of concerning himself with qatars strategic relations with the united states we hope netanyahu decides to operate in good faith and concentrate on the release of the hostages january <number><number> <number> during the first paris meeting progress was made however upon his return to israel the head of mossad was surprised by netanyahus publication of five statements that widened the gaps revealing confidential information during the negotiations february <number> <number> amidst efforts to reach a humanitarian truce before the month of ramadan hamas announced it had responded positively to mediator initiatives however netanyahu quickly leaked statements to channel <number> under the name a senior israeli political official declaring that hamass stance meant rejecting the deal february <number> <number> at the cairo meeting netanyahu delayed sending a delegation when he did he sent them without authorization and accompanied by his personal advisor to restrict the head of mossad he then refrained from sending a delegation to continue the talks despite the negotiating teams support february <number> <number> at the second paris meeting netanyahu called the head of mossad on his way to paris to inform him of reducing his authorized powers despite it being approved by the war council march <number> <number> netanyahu refused to hold a war council meeting to discuss the negotiating teams authorization on the eve of proposed talks in doha a military representative on the negotiating team leaked to the media his frustration with

threats from israels finance minister bezalel smotrich netanyahu announced a military operation in rafah causing the negotiations to collapse april <number> <number> netanyahu leaked confidential information from the negotiations to smotrich who then leaked it to the media causing the negotiations to collapse again april <number> <number> netanyahu contacted the israeli negotiating team without the knowledge of the war council to reduce their authorized powers may <number> <number> netanyahu preempted a response expected by mediators to hamas on an israeli exchange proposal by issuing a statement rejecting ending the war in any way may <number> <number> hamas officially accepted the israeli proposal presented to them however netanyahu hastened to reject hamass response before any security consultations or highlevel meetings june <number> <number> after us president biden announced his plan for a prisoner exchange deal and ending the war on june <number> netanyahu

true however from my reading theres substantial inequality in how different ethnic groups in israel are treated socially and economically if not legally for example there are arab israeli mps in the knesset but theyve never been in any governing coalition and are treated pretty poorly by racial supremacists in other political groups eg the jewish power party i specifically mention white zionists since i think a lot of this current netanyahu nightmare stems from more the politicaleconomic power of recent immigrants from the us or earlier immigrants from ex soviet states while the latter are slavic rather than anglosaxon theyre all white af,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQnJHSXRCR1pGNm92dkJrUDZFN29wNXVOUUlwLW5OZU5CakRMQzRTeHpwdDNyVTA5d3piTTU0eDBhUEEwUkZzQVF1VGcwQ2JNeVFidWJTd2Z5SGFIbi1YRldENnZVWGtreURpRU1tZzRBWHM9

well hamas controls the strip after all dont they i am sure there are insurgencies against hamas but sadly they dont appear to have been successful in ousting them or help stop what happened before it did i think the way israel handles the situation on the ground is wrong but i also dont know how one could handle it without any civilian casualties given the extreme complexity of the situation it would be ideal if the problem had resolved itself and there could be actual talks between palestinians and israel on implementing a solution you cant seriously expect israel to just sit idly by while terrorists keep taking potshots at their cities and send hunting squads whenever they feel like it to kill their people just because they declared that to be their holy mission to rid the world of jews,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWEY0NEVfYnNiUFc4bXdkaVZReGlVNVJlYi1MN0hEU0RkZGdLNXdkZDlLTkh5aXJPRHRIeGZxQ3dzVHFwNW9jR3ZtWmMzNWUzSm81T2ZEV1Z6aTdVcHc9PQ==

no you are incorrect here is a very similar situation where the us nato intervened examining america and the worlds reaction to the klf fightersalbanians and subsequent action to stop serbians displacing and bombing albanians as compared to our reaction to israel hamas shows a clear bias in the beginning klf killed a similar number of serbians as hamas did serbians began ethnic cleansing and mass displacement which is an international war crime america and nato came in and bombed serbia to stop them you can debate whether that was the right thing to do but that is what america did and serbia killed much fewer albanians than israel has killed in gaza in such a short time the targeting of gaza university professors poets and journalists destroying hospitals bombing refugee camps and schools is unprecedented history will look at israel and their supporters with disdain <url>,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhN3U2UExCdmRsckxyUVFVU3hYZGxuSm81ZFBzUW9Fa1ltY0JGWmxrZ2ZxcjNvSWJhOG1KSWRYUnAtVW9HbG1UNWl2V0JseHl2eEhXTWphWUNRRGpsQ2c9PQ==

a few things to consider i am pretty sure the albanians didnt declare that killing serbians is their primary goal of existence furthermore the us did not have a clear bias towards one or the other in that case the us is however allied to israel which is why they are rather tepid in their criticism of israels methods today which i already mentioned in another reply other countries are much stronger in their condemnations of the use of excessive force but almost no one claims that israel cant defend itself in response to what happened,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSk52eFBDWkYwNlFLWUwtczRCZFllbVlMc3ktcWhyMUxFV1NUdmwzcFh0b0daNU1SUHJ3cWRqZ0plS29BR2dWaHE1UEZNd3RHb1hWd2pBUFJWelExNlE9PQ==

so instead of appealing to the international community for a military intervention to get rid of hamas they helpenable hamas to do a bit of terrorism to achieve what exactly dont you see how this does not make sense if palestinians had just attacked a bunch of idf troopers out of hopelessness nobody would be holding it against them the situation is awful after all but what happened is a coordinated military assault including mass killings and abductions of even elders on harmless civilians who were not even part of the settler problem but mostly friends of palestinians hamas is doing the exact same thing netanjahu is both are doing their best to sow strive among people who should really be friends it serves both hamas and netanjahu to keep the war going maybe a global anti terror coalition without israel could solve the issue but i dont see which nations would be willing to sacrifice their own soldiers to defend another nations citiziens from their own terrorists people are rarely ready to die for other people problems that a harsh reality of life,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcXV3R0xxM2lTT19xRnpJRzZWVEFHUUxrX211SDgwS1BubjU0Z1h0a3E3V1NzNFg5Y0VlTUZXWmc1ckhvX2JTeE80R2R6aFROejZleElMSWNNXzZOd3c9PQ==

according to who bc so far israel cant prove its claims prior to their capture of dar alshifa hospital theisraeldefense forces went to great lengths to depict the medical complex as a headquarters for hamas from where its attacks on israel were planned the evidence produced so far falls well short of that idf videos have shown only modest collections of small arms mostly assault rifles recovered from the extensive medical complex that suggests an armed presence but not the sort of elaborate nerve centre depicted in animated graphics presented to the media before alshifa was seized portraying a network of wellequipped subterranean chambers even the videos produced so far have raised questions under scrutiny a bbc analysis found the footage of an idf spokesperson showing the apparent discovery of a bag containing a gun behind an mri scanning machine had been taped hours before the arrival of the journalists to whom he was supposedly showing it in a video shown later the number of guns in the bag had doubled the idf claimed its video of what it found at the hospital was unedited filmed in a single take but the bbc analysis found it had been edited israeli forces say they are still carefully exploring the site the video presentation of alshifa did show the main facilities lay deep underground and it is quite possible the israeli soldiers have not reached them yet so there could be much more to come but the attempt to present what has been found so far as significant is bound to fuel scepticism about whatever is presented later there are questions over how much of its graphic presentation of thenetwork under alshifawas based on what israel knew already its own architect had built an extensive basement area there the last time israel directly occupied gaza up to <number> all of this is significant under the geneva conventionswhich forbid military operations against hospitalsunless they are used to commit outside their humanitarian duties acts harmful to the enemy this exception spelled out in article <number> of the fourth geneva convention states specifically the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy israel ratified the geneva conventions in <number> and claims to observe the principle of proportionality under international humanitarian law in which the direct military advantage anticipated from a military operation outweighs the civilian harm that can reasonably be anticipated as a consequence its observance of those principles is what is in question <url>,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMmR0aDJFV0l4SkEzbmFYeXY1aWtiLUF3cDVKUkNOQW1aSnVEQ0EzZzB0X01oRkFuU2xCejI1VzFuU0doOGpodzJtWUhsdUlSXy1zTWhhYjcwdlFyT2xNWmtvN2JIZWMtMi1ubzhZWUhVTzA9

technically they were given a country or the right to establish one by the british and their local administration as compensation for their suffering given the fact that judaism also historically was a significant part of the region even before islam took over as the majority you cant exactly call it kicking them out either they essentially returned to an old home of theirs and wanted to be independant from its other inhabitants which i think is understandable given their terrible experience with sharing a country with others in europe during ww i get that its not fair that the europeans decided that israel can declare itself a nation on land they did not conquer prior but is that actually what you would have wanted the region is or was at the time not exactly highlydensely populated so a peaceful solution should have been possible i personally would support a one state solution and think its a great idea because i generally would want to get rid of most nationstates but as outlined earlier i believe the jewish trauma would not allow for this and as far as i understand it a lot of muslims dont want it either mostly just the moderates i believe two states are more likely to lead to a peaceful stable outcome in the long run for these reasons maybe a half jewish half muslim administration would be possible for the entire country but for that we would first need hamas gone and a moderate jewish government since netanjahus wing wont agree to this,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnb2p6cThtN0NOYWdaRXhmLTRCcEpwcVhCNUVRcUtiUS13aXh6N2lGNlpic2xEN3MwLWswLXdBZTlycnczSHpxXzk0WDRUVVFvdm90WkR1RFdfamdEWUE9PQ==

exactly the fact that they are ultimately quite similar people due to shared heritage is the justification for why its not exactly the same as kicking them out you can say its flawed reasoning and in essence it is but a freaking world war just ended and people were tired of fighting and the jews deserved a shot at a peaceful life on their own terms after all that if the war wwhadnt happened and the wish would have still been the same i could see how some nation wouldve just bought the land prior but given the administration was already a sort of power relation over the area just like a landlord can decide which tennant he wants to live in his house they didnt have the resources or will to redistribute the land in a more coordinated and fair way which in retrospect was a big mistake but we need to adapt to it now just like colonial subjects these administrations have not exactly been treated as equals back then those were crueler times and i am glad we changed since then an ethnostate could have also been established on peaceful terms secession is a thing and can be handled via treaties depriving the israelis of their say is just as bad and not a real solution to the problem just a recipe for more violence to my understanding hamas is more an extension of a radical expansionist islam propagated by iran and others in their desire to become an islamic superstate they happened to take up the cause of fighting israel but you can hardly say they are fighting for palestinians its their desire to prove their religions superiority that fuels them calling themselves fighters against oppression is just a cheap veil to hide their radicalism from the populace i dont think that a majority of palestinians actually agrees with hamases world view and just want to live their lives which two rivaling factions wont allow them to do,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMm00QVNkOThXcTNNQUE1VGVLMEo4bUZWYVUzZmNpdFh0OGhHQkhxckJtSWNhQWxMN215N1ZyZFd1SVFvSmJWSGkwQWxHSlNRZXRqd3ZLSlFxY3hQb2c9PQ==

i agree that its pretty immoral but almost everything we used to do at some point is now considered immoral you cant judge the past by todays standards we can only learn from mistakes and try to do better you cannot fix what has happened unless you have a time machine then we will have to agree to disagree on what is possible peacefully i have to admit that i am not an expert in islam studies to fully grasp all the details but to me hamases proclamations speak for themselves and dont require israeli propaganda to be badly received by most of everyone else they dont exactly talk of peaceful coexistence and reconciliation with the jews to build a prosperous future on their shared heritage,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMF9PWlh2VWduSi1DYklxTWZPT2RDSC03UzVMWFpoNDRJNmNsdEF0V2E2S29uZnF2MXBIYU1UV053NkdBSmZEeExiNkxESFU1WHFZOE8tMTZQVTNJTWc9PQ==

exactly hamas is like a bogeyman kind of word at this point all rational thinking of how to deal with them is thrown out the window this is what israel wants to just say hamas and expect no further questions and then they completely dodge their reason for existing + ignore their statements + expect israel to be the sole spokeman of hamas like really is this how you expect your courts to work as well allow only for prosecution without any defense why do we trust an entity like israel so blindly especially given the fact that objectively they are the starter of the whole conflict you cant just take over a region and kick out people out of their homes without consequences but israel constantly acts like they never did anything wrong,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUpxenlDTVVFSUFFalNXZUktU1NmMXNITDFhVjgzVUNSb3VfV0V6ZURPR3lxdkE2ZFBiV2tQLWVuNW9BQXpyMnl4QTVkSjMxdFRfa1RLd0J1WnRXU3c9PQ==
they never retracted their founding document which essentially declares jews as the source of all evil having to be eradicated from arab palestine making it quite clear that those are still their desired goals and the facts on the ground lack of own power and support by the former arab league just forced them to put those off for now and strike a more concilliatory tone until they can take control in a state they can control due to forming a majority maybe hamas has really changed their ways i just dont buy it not after what they just showed us they think is okay to do to achieve their goals those are not the actions of a reformed movement,r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYkJSQ2JrN3NBQVFDcU1UOFJrSHRqZTc4UktrdUgtb3NYbjFLR3FsV3hnT29HV2dZaHZWcUcyOE13cFRweVZjanVYTGxOYkZKR1dlclgtVmJTNTZIQVE9PQ==
