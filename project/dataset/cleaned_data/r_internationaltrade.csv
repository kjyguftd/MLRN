you would have to understand how many short term leasing opportunities there are before the company needs to sell it if the containers are for international trade if you can move cheap used containers sourced around laxlgb and figure out how to viably move them back to asia where there is scarcity an efficient transaction could yield high returns if you had the correct network,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSTm05Z0NVYVJaTWI1cy1iUlJCekozSERYbTFDMEVINnhNUE91TDEyN1FGdkQzdUoyUEJZWm9ZdFp2YzRjNHNKV202Qk5YVWZMT1lVTHJuT3lzS201dGc9PQ==

im looking to do something similar from memory the freight forwarder doesnt need to give the coo to the end buyer,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSd21YSk84cUFManRCdi04U0NBNTlBdU45WjJoZmg2cTRfMkZ3a3pPT2ZNNl9GbUcwTERNcXpCSERENm1CdHpqSWtaOUF1eTh2YzVpbkI3YTJ1QWFxdDJTN2NDSkpNVm9tN2Z3RHdPNmRhNUE9
but when the end buyer pays the tariff doesnt he need to obtain the coo at that point of time because the coo can prove if the product could qualify some free trade agreement,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSVTNyX1Q1ZVJIUlJFYkpNbnROSl9UOHkwSkdoZ2ZncE4wX3BRSkd0dnFlaUJpd2xZRFR0MVk2eEI2ckN6VmZ4NDN6NXJucEwtQ29idkQyd1RHUkVDekE9PQ==
the free trade agreement has nothing to do with the factory name it depends on the goods hs code the customs will evaluate the product hs code and compare it with the tariff list you can appoint your forwarder as an exporter the only problem is the chinese factory can accept it or not as it needs to issue by them which is related to their export duties,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSc21RVVdXa0lBSEUzaXpCb3RpZWNsYWxSODEwVjdKSlN5LTJueV9SYnNjU1dtS0Nfck93YksxTlV3eHV3dG04Uml5bzV0OXZuMmZIMWY4cWduanV3LXc9PQ==
actually china national corporation is a small part of the international trade except the millitary actually china national corporation is a small part of the international trade except the military the biggest export market nd import market also consumable market and biggest population country economic scales makes the product cheaper than other markets if there is no profit no one will take the business in the past five years some industry has moved to vietnam india and other developing countries and chinese company invests more on the hightech industry which will compete with the developed countries so that is why there are so many debates for this in the past week the us government give up the tariff sanction to chinese export goods it is a globalized society and as the technology is upgrading the developed country will benefit more from it,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSOE5pa1l3N2xRTU1fWFVBTkhMOWpPWlhXamV4M2Y3YjhtUklndjhhTGdHTUF2RjRGa1JBTWJqTy0zTEpLX1BrWTRIMDVSWWdSWXpFandGOXl3akJDUHc9PQ==

there is no preferential duty treatment when it comes to china the only time you would need a certificate of origin from the exporter is to present it to cbp against a claim for preferential duty treatment not applicable for china really given that there is not a fta in place marking requirements again claiming china is not a benefit they will have to adhere to marking requirements regardless of what it is this does not present a reason to need the original country of origin certificate from the exporter duties the us customs agent should not need it for nonpreferential treatment entries if it is a ongoing issue then you will need to onboard the risk of clearance yourself and get a repayment agreement in placeloccai coo i would recommend making a letter attesting to the facts basically reiterating the coo but on your letterhead do not title it coo however add a perjury statement even i declare or certify verify or state under penalty of perjury under the laws of the united states of america that the foregoing is true and correct people love that stuff lol brass tacks if they keep pushing just be forthcoming with your concern it is valid,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMWJocDRKenZiWXlNemFudWRWbnpjRXFyWklOQUZCUDA2YmNHN19jU1p6d2lVOVM0Y2pEZTZDM05fNmZpTlc3VEd1MTlPVHJLWEVtRElwTXIzYkpKZEJWV1AwYTIxWGRfdk44d0g0QVpCYzg9

no issue what country is the final destination for delivery do you need it packaged and bottled under an established brand or you looking to only source the actual oil and postpone packaging and branding cheaper cause you can use farmer conglomerates some countries require an fda type process to ensure quality so the established brand model works better from the boots on the ground perspective it all comes from the same supply base so the supply model is dependent more on country of import regulations,r/internationaltrade,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSRTF2N0V2RmUzaTBZaGtIUlVKc0poS3BnM19xUHRPMXBuWXF4UWxZa2E3Q29pM0UxbHFZOXJ3LXh0aDhaeHJjMVJRZDJnTXZENXBUeC1uZ2tDOTR5ZGc9PQ==
