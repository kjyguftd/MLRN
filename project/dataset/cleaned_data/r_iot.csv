i recently started working for a vendor in this space an iot sim will do what you need we charge a monthly fee per active sim as long as that fee is paid the sim will remain active fyi unlike with consumer sims youll also pay per received sms the upside is you can send sms directly via an api or the web ui and dont need to pay for service like twilio,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNS245M25RMlROU0NqYnhRWWU4eWptbW9CYkRORjZ3b2YxY0xLcGotUnYyY1Uzdl9UVmpBUFpHS1lMeUZVVUtkRFBZUnpkZEprZWMzNmQtb0RfV0d3ZlE9PQ==
uwb can be very accurate and very fast sampling xsec but youd need a sophisticated antenna array at each goal line to get this which would need to be calibrated which is going to give fans no end of reasons to complain im not against this idea im just saying youd need to test the hell out of it to make sure its extra crazy reliable,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNRW5PWHNHMjhQOGFmSVRqM0h1dHF2Rk9XSEhVSHhoSC14VkdKWjNJclR4Y2h6Z2MtdzJBb3NrRl9MVmtzUWF0cHVxcWNjbFFadG5PMF9hMFZjcEltclE9PQ==
thanks for posting are the antennas expensive why would fans complain do you think another technology might be better maybe a gps module inside the ball or an ultrasonic sensor,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNemdMVHhnd1VjZHZZTXZGdFFoMmRqWkVUbzhFSllEY1JWZ01ZS254Ulk1cXNoWEhDN2RIMGt2OVNrWWNOZ3RrTF84ckFDOGdkQmVLUmVSTlhOczdLdlE9PQ==
oh wrt fans any automated system sucks when it goes against your team its just human nature the antennas are actually quite cheap but as the goal line is such a large area youd need several antennas to get the right signal strengthline of site for an accurate reading the expensive part would be the custom electronicsfirmware to coordinate the antenna signals definitely not an off the shelf project,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNWE5SZ2I5b3FiUEJfczBJWmI4bUFzNlg2RTRKcTBmSHlGaGFXSXQzb1liODVUYnBLdWVUS0JMR0x3Q0V5eHliVGFXWGJqbkx4VDVhUDZyMnYydC04WFE9PQ==
thanks for the reply there are multiple iot service providers who do not make a charge for a received ie mt sms so im unclear why i would want to pay this in addition to a monthly service fee as well,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNNWduWHBXVnk2SUg2cTFxUXVLT1FldmRQN1RLU0JvbHpfSTBMYXlyMXlrM0JfcnRVNTFnVmtkWFE3WFlJUWhxYmhSYTVmSVJPaGNIeVBBVzRoTG9YU1ZjLXVfSHJSQldUYXl3RS1YTUtqQlk9
different vendors have different pricing models youll have to model out what the per sim fee per sms fee and your expected volume of sms comes out to for different vendors the per sms fee is very low with significant volume this can also be negotiated if you want to talk concrete numbers feel free to drop me a dm,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNY2JxQjVCb2tZcXY1aW5jOFp0WENwVXZjLTdiU1UzaTlaUENWOFI5dm9JQy1wVWY4Q2hzOE5SbDhDVlVONlZNdFNKTHJOX0RKTHpiZTBNdWtScnJVZnc9PQ==

interesting in your usecase end users would somehow trigger the sms and youre afraid they trigger more than you budgeted i just checked our selfservice pricing and its ctsms anyway this is just our pricing model with volume it can be negotiated other vendors will have different models i dont know how many devices youre planning for but with enough of them it makes sense to approach vendors to ask for custom pricing,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNaVBYa2FJeTlXT1gxb0NvYmlXdXpXRElSTmFiQjA2dURlUDhoUWMtdzlLcmpRdDlucTFJOE9EUG5YYjN2UTY4QWhWQjR0UUdXNHpLclQwQTRrTkpBTWc9PQ==

if you dm me i will be happy to make you an example offer and calculation based on the nce service with the prepaid model they provide you with a simple onetime price per simdevice and include all the details in the uk there are multiple networks you can use therefore it is also suitable for critical infrastructure applications while you can find the standard offer for <number> eur online which includes <number> sms we can customize it to better suit your specific needs just let me know what you require disclaimer i work for nce and was one of the initial founding team members but even with that and knowing the market i can say that without bias you will likely not find a better solution,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOcWI3LTF1ZlUzbVd5cnNTRElKN29kSEdSZGhZMUJ4MERJMUF3VTJwSk9GTm01ZDBieVRxYWdGOTVVWl9GbDk4MndQLXFLOWZLcnpzM1cwdllOOEpVVWc9PQ==

without sounding too vague its a display based system and the user can update which is what triggers the sms being sent to the simple iot end device some users will update monthly some will no doubt be smart asses and write scripts and do hourly for a relatively small project <number> end devices adding additional checks and controls to prevent it it cost prohibitive i think do feel free to dm me the company name though if rules mean you cant just tell me here thanks,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOZElFRGhSeVNFQ1U0c0x6LUdJTF9MVkh6SnZHRXNRdWQ0SExZSjFjWENxeEpseVJCM2MydS0tcUJFZmdhMk5uSHBEUXNEX3A3MTVfOWJEUy02SGFTNjJvT2JBWHZUSnI1cmtLRFZuSXpiSVE9
maybe you could share a bit more about your requirements and what you need then i can give you a very direct answer you are current that the <number> only include <number> but they also include various other things which you wouldnt need hence we would change the parameters for you use case how many sms do you expect per month or year per endpoint,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOOHBuVTlMSzB3dzU2Mk1rY0tMNGdTd2pMRDROVVZMWEZyYTNGYzRlVXZYVjZkYkhNZE1hellQbWlfem9IY3R0cEZYMmlOTlZONHowd0l4ejN6d0xRQ2c9PQ==

nce is a spinoff from deutsche telekom they want to change the iot market but their service offering only allows certain specific use cases in cellular connectivity with very low data consumption lpwa and therefore their offering cannot respond to the large majority of cellular iot projects requiring greater data consumption they are dependent on roaming agreements from dt or tmobile for the usa in addition for a largescale deployment the basic investment for a company example if you want to deploy <number> devices you will have to pay a basic cost of <cur><number> not counting fixed costs delivery costs cost of the sim with this business model the service is low touch customer service features of their management platform and services included in my opinion even if the price is important in a cellular iot deployment project it is important i think we must also look at the suppliers ability to provide quality service networks security roaming customer service,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQbVAtd1FWeGVha08tREF2Z0xkSDkwc1FTTFdNX1lWZVBfUl9rbS1rWUhZU0ZzUUJ2RjFJdTJ5aUllREMxbmtmbG5KTTc1MDlIM1RvdFc3ZlRJTVd1QUE9PQ==

thank you <number> it wont be used much looking for at least <number><number> weeks battery lasting <number> rarely very rarely maybe once in <number> weeks if that <number> not worried about that as long as the data is sent within <number><number> seconds of when the button is pressed but ><number> seconds would be nice <number> i would expect them to press it again so it could have a green light to show its on then when it is pressed if gps was sent successfully it would maybe show them a flashing green light for a minute or so and if not a red light this will require them to press it again something like this <number> no it will be used mostly indoors and sometimes outdoors <number> urban <number> it can flash red light showing failure <number> dgps <number> to <number> meters would be nice or waasegnoslaas <number> to <number> meters but would be happy with consumergrade gps <number> to <number> meters great questions,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXUGxMZTN6My0xZDVyYXo0dlFDaWU4a3RCRjJPWlVLaklmVDZ4ZFlIQmpWbDJRanRpeDV2al9QNWo3ZVJ1SFNiV29vTWpzY1pkSHRtMG1xRUNSMzlRTGc9PQ==

if you dont care about power consumption you can have the device check its location frequently and keep your cellular modem in a fully connected state as soon as someone presses the button you send a message to your server of course people generally do care about power consumption so you can go to the other extreme put the cellular modem into psm mode and put your mcu into a low power state with an interrupt connected to your pushbutton once the button is pressed you wake up and attempt to get a fix im not a gps expert but i believe that this can take significantly longer than a few seconds stuff that im seeing online is saying <number> minutes once you have the fix you send your message to the server get an ack and then shutdown into your sleep state it may also be worth considering whether you could use nongps methods for determining the location you could for example do a wifi scan and submit your results to a third party service that uses a database of wifi ssids to estimate the location of the device,r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNzZjaGN4WWwzSzhXckg5SXdrWmFjcWlYVW52QUYwUE9xQlY3b0FtV1FSci1JbnFkT0JJcl9BcUNnc1A1NnlzZDU5ZWtfMWpWMDJsNTQ3RjdxbXlTSnc9PQ==
