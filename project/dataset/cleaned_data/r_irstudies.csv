as is typical with articles on geopolitics the author perpetrates some deliberately bad misreadings in order to slander classical geopolitics right off the bat grouping axis of evil alongside the heartland is so tendentiously misleading it could only be deliberately malicious axis of evil is not and never was a geographical concept unlike the heartland the author doesnt bother to explain the heartland just said its deterministic which is incorrect at best the most laughable part of the meat of the article is that is almost no geography at all the author abstracts everything into networks and connections and interstate power relations which is just international relations not geopolitics the final bit about peacemaking is the most ironic portion given where the author started condemning the heartland thesis mackinders heartland piece was advice to the league of nations the international organization charged with promoting and preserving international peace following wwi on the need to provide security guarantees to eastern europe where he thought another war might break out as we all recall nazi germany and communist russia divided eastern europe between themselves and then wwii broke out when hitler broke the pact to invade poland conquer eastern europe and attempt to defeat the ussr the league of nations had not followed mackinders advice the united states had backed out and poland was left defenseless the heartland thesis was for the league of nations as a peacebuilding effort but the author hasnt done the first thing to understand the texts hes slandering,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWk1DeUpDZE1HZFROLVNsT0d0SC1HTnBjSWNURzJRTW83S01GU0hHUFNHSDlVVGpobXUzNWxkUEtYdnYxazRfOUFGV1l6MTRIQk8xYktBWU1jQUU5bXVkYUJEdkdHMG5wUV9UYTd3dHliSzg9

i was closely considering the sciences po paris programme id definitely apply to oxford i know one person on the programme at st anthonys college i believe and it all looks extremely fascinating im not sure if youre looking to specialise in a region but st anthonys is also very good for anything to do with the middle east if youre interested in learning arabic turkish or persian with the academic big names to go alongside it and have very good archives too those all look like amazing programmes if youre considering oxford i would also visit a few colleges if youre able your college isnt the beall and endall but they can all be very different in terms of the type of people they attract and academics too its quite a rigorous programme but they definitely seem to be looking for people from different backgrounds im quite sure there are scholarships to assist with the immoderate price tag so i would certainly apply sciences po paris is also excellent i know a guy who went there and has nothing but good things to say unfortunately for us brits we no longer pay eu fees which was one of the deciding factors that made me stay in the uk as for lille im not too sure but its a very liveable city and probably excellent to be a student in the faculty also seems prestigious but the smaller sciences pos across france grenoble strasbourg etc always seem to punch above their weight my dissertation supervisor studied at grenoble which led to him having quite a successful career in the french ministry of foreign affairs and then academia just my tuppence worth im sure you will make the best decision for you best of luck and congrats none of those are bad options by any stretch of the imagination,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXc0tONVJLcTNLLWM1Q3kxa0RrMTdYUTJLOGJvUDQ1MWZtV3lMbVBPTFpMTmVXZ3Q3UE0td3pxdmFpVVlhZk1FUlFwLXItQngyMC1ROGRVSm9xUE9PbWc9PQ==

congrats on having two great options im not an fso but i work with some and am considering it so im familiar with the process my impression is that spending time abroad and having language skills is valuable it will give you opportunities to display the key skills dimensions that theyre looking for i would consider cbyx if you dont have much experience abroad or if this exchange fits your interests for example is your area of expertise germanyeu can you get involved in projects or research that aligns with your goals then cbyx can probably strengthen your fso or grad school prospects that said the fed government is hard to break into and it sounds like a sweet gig at justice being a civil servant or having a masters degree doesnt necessarily help you join the fs everyone has to take the fsot and is graded on the same skills but you may also build professional experience dimensions which will give you stuff to talk about in your pns oep etc alternatively that job at doj plus a masters if you so choose could open doors to interesting ir jobs in the civil service,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXMWV0UzFrb2FrX0JEWk1oUmFYSm9Kc2RiQ0lDWlBzbjdXWEhKV2djdHNaOFZ6RDRPTTdhVTBHc3U3RE5yVWJ1TS13V0hCWG9yVXVSb1RZTVdWbk9VZ3c9PQ==
>but russia is asking for hegemony over all of eastern europe in return are they though or are they simply asking that we dont build up a hostile alliance on every border we can >asking the us to throw dozens of allies out of nato again i dont think this is what the russians are requesting but even if it were nato loses the baltic states and some of the balkan states these are not powerful allies anyway they are unlikely to swing the pendulum in any major conflict all three baltic states together have a population of <number> million and that includes women children the disabled and the elderly even in total war they could contribute about <number> million and that would effectively be a fight to the death theres not any power to be gained there there is only a buffer zone battlefield to insulate our more important allies from collateral damage,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNkpqLTlRcm94cXpfU2o4aHZvSnpNMmd1SG50RGlHd28ycnpaazdOajFPUmwwaGhmaHA4VnRENFBSeVhjdG5INUpma1dhT2FTcVV5SEVuU3hZVlZBVzhCcFRuLWhVaEFiNDZuM1g0LUFxQTQ9
so your argument is that they are not all that useful but why the fuck does it follow that we should give them to russia and then get nothing in return we should just give them away because russia having them benefits us more than we having them this suggestion is beyond absurd,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWjN3cjdodUdHcUY0ZWw5UzFJWVFxd2ozZlc2dnV1djdsNV83bzVoeGR6MHdZNXQ2c1A1ZHliU1JQSVRKalIyMEhieEpweDd6N3V1YkU3WVlLWmNZQWZwNW04Z1NWNTkyU3pSZ1JMSkJPdFE9
who said anything about giving them to russia you presume far too much firstly that russia has any intent to annex them secondly that an alliance with russia means two third parties making a paper decision about the occupation of multiple countries who even if removed from nato are still eu states like your entire premise is full of conclusions that are non sequiturs,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXSHExRG1PTzFtZGxTMEttQW5oOWYwLTBVTmlBS04xMFk3ajl3dEd5VDRJdjM5MEhUN0tYbEhWQnZoeDlfSTgyMFdmRExtU1RGLW5yMWwwLVBTX1RFNThNZlBaTVlrNnUtT1plVy1WdGpaelk9

not at all but i know my answer is very dependent on my success in finding a job in the field my advice to you and all job seekers is to specialize find something you care about or are interested in and study that write about it publish if you can write a blog if you cant learn a language volunteer or take an internship if you can afford to show people you are interested it helps you stand out,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXZ1Y4N05JM1dnZ1prb0tDWjJjWlVDTE96aG9vcG14eUFrZHh5NlB5bS00MzEtR1B1di1mT0hiUmlmRUttOGN4T2Y3NFE0ZFhCSE5PS2l3dGdYcmdUSFE9PQ==

im an american and i feel like my international studies masters is basically an obsolete degree that was built for the mid to late th century in a cold war context where the country was trying to build a more extensive foreign policy apparatus to counter communism the need for that exhausted itself and the field is now aged out and by a country mile it now seems to most effectively serve people now who already have a foot in the door who want to move ahead or sterling golden child type students who are very focused i believe that it has little if any particular advantage with respect to entering public service or internationalrelated careers these days vis a vis other academic displines and degrees the pipelines into public service that do exist for somebody without prior professional experience or status as a military veteran ect are totally saturated with brilliant people who went into it with a highly targeted approach who have clearly targeted sterling records and a clear trackrecord in service of a working in a specific area or they have critical language fluency and specific in demand technical skillsets internships are hit or miss insofar as getting a job and are in expensive places and you cant realistically do them unless youre willing to live in poverty or have wealthy parents i know people who did state department internships and intenrships in think tanks who bailed out because they still couldnt translate it into a career i went to an elite school for my masters and im a few years out from graduating and i see lots of people in my cohort who are doing things unrelated or are serving at a much lower level than they thought they would like local and state government and regional ngos people who went to law school people who got unrelated additional degrees in things like cybersecurity and data science the people who did the economics track by far seem to have the most latitude ive found that the career services people for my alma matter are defensive with students and are failed international relations professionals themselves interacting with them was a frustrating and dissapointing experience ive found that i lose out to people with law degrees and masters of public administration for policy jobs i lose out majorly to people with secuirty clearances for intelligence work i lose out to people who were more targeted for ngos or people who did things like the american peace corps something for which i applied and am waiting on i dont regret getting the degree in and of itself because it made me much smarter and more dynamic and allowed me to find strengths and talents i didnt know i had but i completely exhausted myself trying to find a route in and im going to probably end up getting more specific credentials and education to supplement it and find a much more clear and direct career path i hope that it will eventually facilitate finding something with an international element but im not counting on it,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS3V3ZmxoMHY5YklYenU4YkVJbXFVVXZLbkpxQ2xIS25QS1JDZE95VzZ2bXlMa3BzcUIwNHdNT0o4bVFiVGliRUZMWkNvOTJiUjAwc0FlcFNla0dOdmc9PQ==
my gut feel advised by career experience is that an ir degree needs a specific regioncountry focus even during the cold war that was a necessity soviet see kremlinology and to a lesser degree ee specialists western european specialists and with the rise of japan as the second biggest economy japan specialists today china is a sufficiently complex entity of long history that requires specialisation the regional dynamics in east asia is similarly complex and in my view requires specialisation,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYemJzN19JdnlZSUhVM2FkYkpzY0tzOWF3R1lfOGZNbXVYTTZhZGtyQ2lEdVQ5QWNqaFhTYi1Yd19LR1ZYVjVzazlhTWdaZmtKaHFYV0psYUpsUW9hR0E9PQ==

i feel as though the only reason i dont have regrets about my path is because i chose military service right out of high school then only in the past few years began my degree path across two branches i traveled to ish countries filled many roles and matured as a person to a degree thats hard to quantify my studies sorta contextualized my experiences and shed light on the things i was a part of in a way that gave me a robust understanding of how the world works suffice to say the order of my progression led to the whole being greater than the sum of its parts so to speak of course im not saying the military is the only way or even advisable for some im just reflecting on my previous disappointment of starting my degree so late and being thankful for the way things turned out,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMFJOeWZsbjF4SGJrUEk0R0FBb0t4QjRTWFpGRTAtNUhlcEdsY041b2ZyVzN2SWJ3N2xjN2J4SXV5QWM3NTdrcFBYbW9rVW1lQTVpYVZkNkhnUVpoakVsSWpUZWl6SUhrMDkxZkhMamVPbGs9

i dont regret it overall because i knew going in the employment prospects were not great what i do regret is not being more involved in extracurricular student life particularly during my undergrad most of my friends were not in my program which meant missing out on having friends to share that particular interest with plus a stronger network of people actually in the field after graduating not sticking out a couple of undergrad econ courses they were dry and difficult but i think they would have added a lot of value to my studies not picking a region topic and sticking to it i kind of bounced between middle eastern counterinsurgencycounterterrorism studies subsaharan african peacekeeping and sinoafrican relations and came out of my undergrad and masters feeling like i knew a decent amount about all of them but was not particularly strong in any of them not taking the study of a second language more seriously from everything ive seen speaking an additional language is a huge asset in the field if not a borderline requirement especially if you are going to be regionally focused which as others have mentioned is the majority of ir jobs as a canadian french is super important if you want to go into most government roles and a third language would really set you apart after that not giving a ton of meaningful thought or research into what i wanted to do until i was getting close to finishing my masters not planning for a masters until my final year of undergrad and then not assessing my masters program choices based on any metric other than the country it was in and the ranking it had in that country i really wanted to go to the uk and picked based on british rankings without any thought for how the program actually matched my career goals or interests not considering how working eligibility would factor into my career options and how the country i am eligible to work in would affect those options not taking networking more seriously until later i hated the term until my latter university years it was so vague and yet thrown around so often i avoided it because i didnt want to make sense of it yet ultimately all it is is getting to know people and talking to them about what they do and usually theyre pretty interesting anyways all that being said im still glad i chose ir and poli sci as an academic career path because it lead me to where i am now and i am happy with what i am doing and where i am in life if you had asked me in the first year after graduating from my ma when i was working in a shitty call center job and struggling to even get a reply to a job application i would have given you a very different answer so dont lose hope and with some hard work and good luck youll look back at this post in a few years and hopefully feel like you made the right choice after all,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc21UdWs0UGZ5cDBac2VUVGM2bnU1djZNdEljWXcwQ0JEazZ1Rm5XbVhNRlczSWhZV0I4TFFNTE1oVE5tSDlCOTB5ZUQ5NFFhSFJYNnFJaklSRXFZcXZKSHA0a3dZVGd0cDZQb0Z0bWV0Z1k9
not really i think it depends more on the country here in australia ir is still considered a major field of study theres a massive academic base for it and many government positions will accept an ir or polsci degree as a tertiary qualification there are also heaps of careers to be had at ngos and notforprofits and some companies specifically look for people who study ir and have a good grasp on how international relations works,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYanpvOVVjblAtWU1feWxKMlBxUl96RVgzdnFZMzlYdzRCSTRrRUNNdWJ3WlFzSFJTNGhib2taSkcwNjRpM1cwdEc1VjdweHA0TTV1STBIanpaQnE5TUE9PQ==
mearsheimer contradicts himself in one key area he claims nato troops on the border of russia in ukraine and georgia are perceived by russia as an existential threat and understands why russia invaded these two countries but iran is open about destroying israel and iran is already shown to be willing to kill millions of people in yemen iraq syria lebanon to protect its interests and when iran has allies in hezbollah and hamas directly on israels border he blames israel for wanting to conquer and destroy hezbollah and hamas in this scenario iran is the usa and its proxies in hamas hezbollah and the houthis are nato forces on israels border of course israel would want to destroy hamas and hezbollah and hamas hezbollah iran and the houthis are much bigger existential threats to israel then nato forces are to russia but mearsheimer condemns israel at every chance he gets and it shows his hypocrisy on the situations mearsheimers logic defending russia invading ukraine and georgia should apply even more to israel going after hamas and hezbollah,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ3JCQnNWaDkzMmZzQWZOZGQ4YW5FdXUwSE9ud00zbllUX2xWM1d3blpraVFDdGZzSEtBUXhoT19rblYyT0VxM21CS2NhYjZqT1FfQ1ZDLTg5bTJRZXpkX2EyWVVIV3E2bjJhUUxBUlBUaWs9
the difference is that iran does not deploy its forces en masse outside of its country they use the quds force as advisors and attaches but thats about the limit of their foreign deployments and the number of actually iranian quds soldier outside the country at any time is likely below <number> meanwhile there are hundreds of thousands of american troops in europe,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVUFOeTBwRWV5T1JWUVZ0cnI3VkhDUDNPSlMya1NUU00tRWgwTzAtdTNSU1pvS1JGT2xWVmRNUERJM0xOQW9yVEhmWUFYVVdQNjJ2dGw3NktfQ0l0eXc9PQ==
hezbollah is very powerful and religion still plays a huge part in its alliance shia sunni split is more powerful than country alliances hezbollah has hundreds of thousands of missiles that if unleashed can kill tens of thousands of israelis and destroy the economy no country would ever accept this,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdHFhX3BGblJEVVlIYU1yMHFyeUlHcjdndkRWLVBwSHVBV0ozSGJuUFZqMlhLRjlXbUhRQ00wUzV4NEZrVk5Hc3JsN2F6SWZQaHdEM211MHBsNTVnMHU4WDY4NHFwb202VW54SmY1WnJXM1U9
and yet hezbollah is deterred from unleashing even a fraction of their full arsenal because they know that israel is far more powerful than them and could annihilate lebanon quickly in such a scenario thats what you are missing the sheer size of the power imbalance between the two,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYejJ2anBJNkVnVHBIWnotd2l4V3ZKd1BNanBVUDJKMmRVaFJNWFF4a3lLYi1DeFBGQjhjQVBnMFJxX1pHQnczNUZxM3p2TWVidHdFdllqWEVfQ0FIVEE9PQ==

>i guess that is the reason why ir graduates first work in companies to then later join ngos i think theres just a major misunderstanding across the academic spectrum about what a degree does studying ir does not inherently mean that you are then qualified and capable of working at an ngo it means you generally understand what an ngo does in the broader context of foreign affairs taking a class on international development doesnt mean youre suddenly prepared to be a project manager overseeing a pepfar program for care its up to you to go get the experience necessary to be qualified for an ngo whether you want to work in programming policy or as hr you cant just apply and expect to get it because you studied ir theres a million of us,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX1lXM3JPeEpLVXY3NjNTeU9ROFlSVkJJaG9DTXBCZHlJZ3pFa2F3aFhzS0FLNEpodFA4dnpCb2EyRTBZSmswdUdPa01yenRMY25xUmZfS3NtblpfZUE9PQ==

i can relate to this as well i enjoyed the program very much especially the conflict and security course where we broke down oif the econ courses like political economy were great too that being said i realized early on that a masters was the bare minimum to get in the ir field i work in finance now and my ba is in intl economic relations so i market it as an econ degree,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQUNCNklrekpFOW9qWmNQX1BESFVRSFVoR0N1RzlKX29haENMdDByb2x3Z1NHbmRGMllyTGU1aFdQTXJaZDhPa1pYQlpURTB5UF82aVFzMENack4wb0E9PQ==
did my masters in ir and got my degree in <number> irrelated roles and the field in general was still relatively niche in <number> in asia i think that sort of helped me compete and get a foot in the door my fortunes may change given the economy but looking at the number of ir graduates being churned out now i think i would struggle if i was just entering the job market rn,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMG1ZQktEY0o3ZW9OMEl1NnhfcFRmOFR2anpjZG83bGpvb0hmNl9GM1FRQ2tuU1hCTHZMT3dKRWNIcE9HcjlCSGN4Z1k0NmRuRXVBNFFYVVh4UEdTM0E9PQ==
got it have you looked into the corporate intelligence industry ive hired a number of entry level analysts over the years and your profile masters degree foreign languages international experience would be good grounds for an interview invite not sure how many jobs there are in ireland doing that though how about trust safety roles in tech they often need foreign languages as well and ireland definitely has plenty of those jobs might be staring at the worst content uploaded and shared on facebook though if you send me an anonymized cv i can take a look as well if you want ive done quite a bit of hiring as mentioned just an offer,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX0ZiTGxXVVFjbEdmY3pfalh5U083blZISXBEbmhXeElFc1RlQ2RJYl9NSDhSMG5URi1GTFBPTDhJdTRsbjRxeW5aUlN2UkI4eG9JdXdHZW1RR21TU2c9PQ==

i dont know anyone personally but ive heard very good things i think linkedin can be quite useful with this sort of thing as you can find people who work in positions youd be interested in and specific organisations youre interested in and see where they went to universitygrad school and what they specialised in but youve probably done this already it seems like the grad institute is definitely wellrepresented in many igo jobs the programme looks specialised which is very good for a masters degree in a competitive field the faculty seems excellent and genevas a very nice city albeit expensive i suppose the question is what do you want to specialise in and what would you like to get from what you study other than good employment prospects if your interests are more along the lines of international history and the history of diplomacy it seems like the first two programmes would suit you better than the second two in terms of diplomacy but more historyfocused the vienna school of international studies might be really good too but i dont want to complicate your decisionmaking at the end of the day id follow what youre really interested in im sure the rest will follow youve done very well to get to a stage where youre considering all of these extremely prestigious programmes and i think studying something that really fascinates you will help when you have to write your ma dissertation or even further research if you find something youd like to investigate at phd level best of luck and let us know how it goes,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZWJNMXdyYmk0dGRDenU2Mnp5Nm5Db215ZWwyQ0U0dGdLYXZmelN5bE9zQjh5dTRkTVB6Sk9JZmY3RklkdlZOTFBJUXZ4VlQtb3JXTFZmS1hoYmczaUE9PQ==

i think it really depends on what interests you the most i studied arabic as the faculty is very good where i was at university i was able to study in three countries across the middle east and loved it do i sometimes consider what it would be like if i went to taiwan to study mandarin or studied russian instead or even japanese or finnish of course i think the other thing you could look at is choosing a more narrow field of study to specialise in conflict conflict stabilisation international political economy political economy of development etc at the end of the day i think its very difficult to go wrong if you specialise in either of these ways unfortunately i think being a generalist is less celebrated by the education system and when getting a job those skills however will really help you once youre in your desired career field learning a language takes a lot of time as does studying conflicts and potential solutions for example so id take your time and dont worry too much about it once you find something that really interests you the rest will follow in terms of languages sometimes really niche is good think maybe vietnamese persian khmer swahili indonesian polish but it really depends on what part of the world youd like to specialize in and probably live in for quite a while too and which morenarrow field of study sparks your interest if you factor in where youd like to study and what languages they offer i think it would give you a good idea of whats available to you maybe you can also look up some of the more interestinglooking professors what they teach and their research interests see if both of these things align with what you would like to study in summary dont worry about specialising too much at this stage many successful people in the ir field only did so down the line masters and sometimes phd focus on your interests and play to your strengths in terms of skills above all choose somewhere youd enjoy being best of luck and im sure youll make the right decisions for you,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYM1ZhcC01cWUxVXRseklkS1lfZ2hwRGhmQ1BUUFo2ZXVkSkRsbm5OZVBXVC05c1pZR2ViQUJ6dGJ1ckdmSFlCR0FfSjZ4b0syMExlVTA4ZnQyNTVlTlE9PQ==

i totally get that it came across as so inauthentic and fake when i was first thinking about it try and move past that mindset and think about it as genuinely trying to get to know people who do things you might be interested in doing or will end up in jobs where you might want to also work it will really help broaden your ideas of career options and can really really help get your foot in the door when the job hunt time comes also im obviously biased but i think people who study ir are usually pretty interesting people with global interests so just hearing their life stories and what they do on a day to day basis can actually be super interesting,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTkZsNTB6R083MGdIY3Utd1Ntb01VR3BtZXRsWS1Ua2xpZU8yclowV2xkbnhQa3F1cVpoTEU2U0NnVmM3U0syOTFXbW1ZVDJ6eW93SjZkaU9jUzVMa0VVbThqT0xKVThqUTJWV0FwSHpYeDg9
i mean if you think about the purpose of kyc its to ensure your clients are in compliance with national and international financial regulations are not politically exposed or if they are that they are above board are not committing money laundering or financing criminal or terrorist groups and are not violating sanctions all of those things tie into ir topics like igos globalized finance sanctions etc my kyc job was an entry level position but i think the interviewers were impressed by the fact that i could speak about what sanctions were and why political exposure was important visavis bribery and corruption concerns with a reasonable degree of confidence all of that came from having studied ir,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVl93VG1Mei03VVB3TjQwTFVQenRjZ2xkcVZUWlllU2FaemdkNkpJNEd1MEdtT2FWdTNESmJIQUxVdnNmTXRYbms1U040Q2kwMGd2N1k2TUQxc2JSdS0tSVpzcmdubThrcmswMWFTNFdqSFU9

it was as smooth as it could have been for any new job where youre transferring industries i think ir gave me the fundamental skills i needed for this type of consulting kyc gave me a ton of context for why clients care about dd and a good familiarity with some key concepts like political exposure and sanctions compliance and having worked in capital markets gave me valuable familiarity with the industry that my firms clients and our research subjects operate in settling into the job itself i think the hardest parts were untraining my mind that was so used to flowery academic writing and and retraining it to do much more succinct plain language business writing instead i also struggled with the litigation reporting side of what i do as i had no background in law so rapidly consuming and summarizing court documents was a steep learning curve but that came with time and i have little issue doing it now,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTjJ4aHZNYnlCdmZBbTFIX3M1S0xVS1I4aENUaEV1T3BqMEJ5Qm5ZWU1WTklPbTZfNHYxR081WGJYUFZHVzVZY1VhQkpGeU4yWjEtSmtUcFRhMWRfUkhjT0JMY0djTkFkRDM5N1ZfM2prY3M9
i feel like the problem with degrees like ir history sociology etc as that it doesnt offer a clear cut path as some other social science degrees like economics do while its all good to focus on orgs like government the un ngos etc i wouldnt count on getting in at least right away you have to be creative in your job hunt and put energy towards places that might not relate to the degree also if it makes you feel any better the economy right now in most developed countries isnt great at all i know people who have engineering or accounting credentials having difficulty finding jobs,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRnFQYzlRVkNEaU04eHU3Z2ZocUpPYVktcnJlTFpfcW5ybWtHblhDWjBMS0tNSWl5cE01ZXN3TmVTRmUzT2VpU2Y4ZmtUYlNiTDdJU3ZhblVoUmdISnc9PQ==
i got a sort of ir master it was on international security because i was interested and i wanted to know more i think that should be the primary outset of getting an ir degree you do it because it interests you always keep the expectations low on actual jobs as long as youre doing what really interests you i first wanted to do my thesis on counterinsurgency in pakistan but ended up doing it on cyberwarfare in <number> because i wanted to know more about a field that felt very underexplored the decision also come after meeting pakistani people that made me realize ill never really be able to make very indepth analyses on a country ill at most read about from nd and rd degree sources without learning urdu many here have recommended specialisation and learning another language if you want to stay in ir and i can wholeheartedly confirm but another avenue to take is also to up your digital skills and pursue an ir carreer on internet affairs i did some cybersecurity moocs to level up my knowledge on the technical side and ended up working on national cybersecurity for a few years and later in european cyberdiplomacy ive now age <number> gone back to uni to do a phd on international platform governance because it interests me and who knows what ill do after im not saying theres jobs galore in cyber but theres not that many people able to translate digital matters to the international policy level i also did a small stint in the private sector and while it wasnt for me i realized i could always fall back on it,r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMm1rTUhXOHFYOFFFeTlxT0FSeHlvX1pOQWhhT28tcHBSV1lNeXVZR1cydF9EaFlQcXJRUlhqd0ZkeWxkbl9uQTdpZDd4eHdEcXZWbFV2VkRXY3gxTXc9PQ==
