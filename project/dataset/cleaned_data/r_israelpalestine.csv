there are so many bad faith assumptions in the lancet comment the biggest one is also quite important in terms of the hague cases its been alleged israel is purposefully starving gaza the lancent article takes it at face value and assumes a large but unspecified number have died or will die due to lack of food but there are literally zero evidence for any type of famine or starvation the organization that calculates the ipc scale found no evidence of famine in fact they conducted a survey on deaths in gaza finding that direct conflict deaths occur but got no responses from gazans saying they know anyone who died of starvation and this is coming from an entity that wished there was a famine ipc folks still believe theyll find a famine someday therefore if these people couldnt find a single famine death from a representative sample of gazans that they surveyed theres absolutely zero justification for the lancent people to claim anticipated deaths standing at tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of gazans due to starvation its purely a blood libel theres absolutely no evidence for this claim if the un or the hague had any modicum of credibility theyd give little to no weight to claims made by such entities as unwra or the hamas ministry of health or al jazeera if the united states was smart and a good ally it wouldve stopped pretending like the un has any legitimacy the head of the un mission in gaza just posted these lies on twitter this just gives me back flashbacks to the covid hysteria maybe not a popular opinion but its an opinion that should be we used to claim america has a much higher mortality rate than countries like russia or kenya well of course we did we have a competent generally speaking government while russia lies about their mortality rates or just doesnt bother to check and then experts come around and use these dumb statistics to impose all sorts of nonsense measures that did more harm than good even after the vaccines and the mutations to still believe in experts from self proclaimed neutral or objective entities after the covid fiascos is beyond me,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMGdaWGNjX012WV81Tjc2NjJBZWt0MkVkSHF3U1k0cXlyMHlIN3ZMVVRLTVhiUjVIaVR1ZkZvbHNURXdfMGNETUZ0QUpzLS03eFBSbzlkZWJ1c2I5empaVTdGTGtVTWpDay1wRW1tcUFrYm89

because israel is a sovereign state that can dictate its own immigration policies just like any other state israel is far from the only country with such laws incredibly callous of you to insist that the survivors of the worst genocide in human history and their descendants be forcefully repatriated to the very countries that exterminated them on an industrial scale within living memory what do they have to go back to mass graves ash and centuries upon centuries of murderous antisemitic violence at the hands of their countrymen the majority of israeli jews areare descendants of jews who were forced out of arab countries should they all go back europe too why shouldnt everyone everywhere be forced to return to wherever their grandparents were born would that solve anything or is it just beholden to jews because what jews are the ultimate source of most of the worlds problems let me guess a lot of problems would disappear if only the jews would disappear right but youre not an antisemite you dont have any problem with jews,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSzBHWkl2bVkwcmUzRF8zU3pMYThGTFBWcHd5ZUhXUGVfbUZJSC1BM0M3am1GNWhGUVNlczlUZVpNRUNscnE3NWtfYU5qNVpUODhwNmdfMWJWSXVIRmc9PQ==

>common misconception but actually the jewish population only owned about <number> of the land before the un recommended they be granted a state encompassing <number> of it and arabs only owned <number> of the land in mandatory palestine most of the lands are owned by the state >you might have misunderstood because you didnt read it the question wasnt whether people have a right to move somewhere of course they do just as anyone who wants to has a right to move to israel today and nobody in israel would try to stop them the question was whether shared ethnicity with people who live somewhere gives you the right to move somewhere and take land from other people who live there or i suppose set up your own country in this new territory and declare yourself and your fellow immigrants to be the government and to have political control over anyone else living there because your statement was confusing the right to move is irrelevant jews have the rights to set up their own country in mandatory palestine and they dont have to prove anything israel has been recognized as a sovereign state under international law >was it explained at the time that any land israel decide to seize using military force would then become israel because if not i dont see what gives israel the right to use military force to seize additional territory as they are currently doing you mean israel wants to seize gaza and absorb millions of hostile population who would be funded by its taxpayers >they had a tiny fraction of the population in those places the settlements have expanded by more than <number> times the total population of the gaza settlements in the past two decades alone it isnt remotely comparable and until israel demonstrates that it is capable of forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of the west bank and into israeli territory by actually doing that i see no reason to pretend to believe that they ever intend to do this more claim you dont have to believe it they are capable of doing that and have done that >no they didnt they didnt annex this territory at the time when they could have extremely questionably justified it through a defensive war because they didnt want to give the people living there the right to vote as such it is not israeli territory and they have no right to seize it today so what makes you think israelis want to annex all area c of west bank with hundreds of thousands palestinians living there who dont want to be a part of israel >yes you do think this you think its ridiculous that people think land their parents and grandparents used to live on could possibly be theirs through some sort of farcical inheritance or whatever people might call that but youre fine with people claiming land through an ancestral connection from thousands of years ago for me i still think it is laughable they want their grandfathers land back then what all of them live in israel a country that they hate >ah yes the security justification of needing to house large numbers of civilians in dangerous territory in case a war breaks out just putting them there are some sort of metaphorical shield but instead of being formed of something like metal this shield is made up of humans this is very believable its right up there with the competing claim that israel isnt expanding the settlements at all they have nothing to do with it and the settlers arent part of any deliberate plan can you find out in the internet the percentage of israeli settlement in the area c and what is the majority of the land used for >show proof that israel have offered to return area c in any negotiations not some of area c but area c first you have to show a proof that i claimed israel has offered to return area c in any negotiations,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcVhUa25IcFZwWnR1WmMzLWRvOWlKWDMxWV81RXdBSmRzQjRHd1QtcktGUGtNN2oxTFBNMDcwT3JKc3FiT1p6X0lPT0FaM0RpUWFTSWU4bWNXajZUeWVVbzhZM05VUlBEZUpSSVpEZ29oMzg9

what victimblaming you actually proved ops point by showing how hypocrisy works yes hamas chose to enter israel and it was a brutal and unjustifiable terrorist act that doesnt negate israels part and how they handled it ops analysis seems fairly accurate and neutral to me op even acknowledges the lack of tolerance for israelis among palestinians in general but says thats not true the other way around,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUDhyNEppVVlZQ2hOcE4xTEEyYndhRHZveDBvOEhSY2gySjBhNXdRb1RmQ1lNLWRQZ1BMQ05VT2U5NXBKS2hVcXB6dVZ2blV6VkJpWnBDSnAxaDdlZ1E9PQ==
doesnt that trouble you not really thats for three reasons the first and foremost is that most palestinians dont believe that hamas committed any crimes there are a number of reasons for that they range from distrust of israeli news being unaware of what went on in that day or the perception that hamas was fighting israel for palestinian rights when no one else has or will the second reason is that its normal for people to support organisations that are nominally fighting for independence and liberation especially when no one else will the increase of support is normal for a population that wants its liberation the irish the algerians the libyans all were largely supportive of the faction that nominally fought for their independence no matter the crimes that the faction committed the third reason is that the palestinians in gaza are in an active warzone right now suffering greatly at the hands of the israeli counter attack and hamas is generally regarded as the leader of the defence of gaza from the israeli counter attack i think its natural for people in gaza to want to support hamas in the circumstances i expect that when the war dies down hamass popularity will go downhill so long as the aftermath is handled correctly if israel occupy gaza militarily the same way they occupy the west bank hamass popularity will soar even more,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSFlDMkNyMUlGaGd3ODJJaHJiSGNWYVNTMnBpTTN3SFpjbktyMWlRbjMwOFJndkZoZ1RjSGlrVmxiY1NITktPcnNBSVowS3hEWWFSMWlSTWRIeGFHQWc9PQ==

you when hamas does terrorism  you when israel does terrorism  no army is perfect and ofc the subsequent response is israel is merciful because they dont nuke gaza paraphrasing this is utterly psychopathic and silly because israel would become serbia if they were to do such a thing nobody can go unpunished for leveling the place but they can nearly starve out the whole population destroy corpses destroy every building on sight steal land etc etc etc and still claim to be the good guys that way they are the merciful ones despite being abominable also the claim that the current civilian to combatant ratio is <number><number> is absurd though youre probably paid to say this stuff so there isnt much point if entertaining the idea that israeli estimates cant be taken seriously,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcXY0bUxXZ2RfYVhHS1FkbjlWaUFDc0Y2WC1kU0NwR045dXZyMmhvaDltb1FBMTNlNWN0U3JZaDNkakdCSHRFSmtaZTJNMDNKbXVqRnVHSWhrb05JQkE9PQ==

im not israli and i dont live anywhere near middle east so im not exactly afraid of what they will do to me but to answer your question yes in a way israel is to blame as to why people might view them with hate but thats not to say that islam on general isnt hateful towards jews yes israel is a terrible neighbour so were most muslim countries back then > even though israelis might deserve that palestinians largely voice that they want to live in peace on their land israel has refused them that since the early s important to note the follwing argument isnt mine they are mostly what i have gathered from israeli people when they are talking on the subject palestinians have proven time and time again that they dont want to live in peace considering every time there have come negotiations they have refused them because they arent in good faith in addition to that they commonly used gaza as a base to launch rockets into israel this lead to the occupation of gaza > maybe actually stop settlers from killing and harassing them to steal more land or lift the military occupation and give them equality im pretty sure there is still a palestinian population in israel and as far as i can tell there is equality among people in israel meaning an arab and a israeli have the same rights > there is real raw racism baked into the way you perceive arabs you need to ask yourself why that is to start to change things oh nonono i dont have a problem with arabs i have a problem with islam and what that usually entails as to why some bad apples leave such a strong impression that it quickly destroys any trust you had religious extremism in modern times is almost exclusively the work of islam extremists afterall how can i not be wary of islamists when a cartoon of muhammed apparently calls for terrorism and death,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZHVrazJvRDFwQ1ROT01VeGZjZUc4TDBLSW1FZHNmWHJOSGtDeEN3QzBjNy12d1F5UWdLbGgwdHFnc0hGdk1xZ0lFYU5pQS14a3dRTVhMeTBCN3JhOUE9PQ==

czechoslovakia didnt need to deradicalize their sudeten germans and it had been a great success the problem with this conflict that i never see spelled out is mainly this jews even the most extreme kahanists dont have an issue with palestinians living there with full individual rights its palestinian collective rights as a nation that are denied palestinians are denying jews all rights their goal is to have no jews living in palestine even as individuals with no nationalistic aspirations so that leaves the complete removal of palestinians as the only pragmatic solution from israels point of view nothing else is going to work if palestinians were finns or swiss we could talk about one or two state solutions alas that is not the case,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZei1YVjdPMFRmNURLazdwb2h2UXJSR1JMYVRINzhuSzl3SkRyTDgzc3l4NGVacHdZc3RMOXN1WGdKcmRTd0JoY2hKN0o4SWtzX015Wmg2dTZ4MUxEcHB1WFd4YjVuQjJiSmtSUzNoZXJXZUk9

i guess because my sexuality isnt my entire identity first of all theres move to life than sex palestinians trace their dna to the caanites sure theyre arabized and the palestinian label is very new but theyre an indigenous people and i dont support creating a state over indigenous peoples and cleansing to make space for people with better values like seriously its crazy european jewish people starting settlements in the late <number>s and then pushed the british and european governments to give them a state in which they removed mostly everyone within their new borders and destroyed hundreds of villages and now theyre building more and more settlements in the west bank with the intention of eventually kicking out all the palestinians there and then theyll move on to jordan then lebanon syria and then the entire semitic world wont even really exist obviously thats way down the line but its kind of obvious the direction this is going the ethnicities that invented civilization the abrahamic religions etc will just not exist anymore what hamas did was stupid obviously because they definitely cant win,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbDJHZUo2ZU81MWQxMU4wdW82Y2hYUko1ekRORERuUDNOVWdzTXQyY0owMEdNM00zSmhGRUtoVXExN2VfaGlIVFdXTVBXT3h4ekVMX09vTF8tT2hNQXVibVFuZkZ5bU5TSUxnZkJBYWNhczA9

>israel is not a democracy it is an ethnocracy that is practicing the crime of apartheid on palestinans israel is a true democracy and ranks higher than <number> of arab countries in term of freedoms according to every major research group this includes the <number> million muslim citizens >zionists militas did deir yassin massacre on th of april <number> almost two months before the arab attack which took place in th may <number> arabs in the levant destroyed jewish villages multiple times over the centuries literally they they would riot and kill jews every time a child went missing because they think we drink baby blood blood is not kosher btw for the record and its never ok to eat humans the grand mufti of jerusalem literally met with hitler to discuss him eventually coming to deal with the jews >meanwhile <number> million jews were ethnically cleansed from iraq iran syria lebanon morocco tunisia algeria libya egypt afghanistan yemen and more >how is this the problem of palestinians why should palestinians pay for it because they are muslim arabs half those countries are in the levant and the arab league especially egypt syria jordan lebanon etc went to war with israel in <number> resulting in the loss you refer to as the nakba >its like saying that i want to punish the french people because the swiss the germans and the spanish did something bad to me since they all are eurpeans literally no the plan of the zionists was to live in israel and create a state for jews legally through land purchased with minimal displacement of the natives and accepting those natives who are likeminded and share values literally israel could have kicked out <number> of palestinians from israel but they did not they also kept <number> of the druze and even invited every druze in all sorts to move in including the golan heights >what is more its not a one unifed event morroco for instance banned jews from leaving morroco to israel but they still immigrated because israel presented itself as their true home israel is our true home we come from judea we speak hebrew and judea aramaic and jerusalem has been our qibla for <number> years also there were massacres of jews all over the arab world but dont worry ill post another comment listing them if you ask for it since you brought up deir yassin as if insane extremists arabs dont exist in much higher number than that of jews >palestinians are not jordanians why would a palestinian born in haifa his grand father born in haifaetc why should he leave so that a jewish person from ukraine poland yemen or ethiopia go and live there before it was called jordan it was literally called palestine then it was called trans jordan then it was called jordan the hashemites who rule jordan arent even from there also there was no such thing as palestinian arabs before <number> except as defined by the british there were various tribes that self identified by tribal affiliation arabs in gaza are completely different from arabs in galilee also literally at least half of jordanians identify as palestinian today so yes jordan is a palestinian country imagine if a country had a <number> population of jews and i pretended it wasnt a jewish country jeez louise >israel is the only jewish state and the historic homeland of the jews who are from judea >this doesnt give israel any special rights to ethnically cleanse palestinans kill them or torture them i agree im against ethnic cleaning and torture i want all people of canaanite descent including jews and palestinian arabs to live together happily in peace >in <number> british empire proposed the white paper they wanted to create a multiethnic state with equal rights between arabs and jewish immigrants >palestinans said yes zionists said no and started a civil war killing both arabs and brits of course they rejected it arabs convinced the british to create trans jordan in <number> and then they convinced the british to go against the balfour declaration and the white paper limited jewish immigration to israel to <number> people you think they should have accepted that in <number> jews were increasingly in danger all over europe we badly needed safe haven over the next <number> years <number> jews died literally today there are <number> million less jews in the world than in <number> >zionist terrorist group lehi

>and arabs only owned <number> of the land in mandatory palestine most of the lands are owned by the state yes and once we add this information to the mix the fact that israels founding constituted taking land from people who lived there continues to be true and so the question of why sharing an ethnicity with the local population gives you the right to do that continues to be relevant >because your statement was confusing the right to move is irrelevant jews have the rights to set up their own country in mandatory palestine and they dont have to prove anything who else has the right to set up a country there if a population of immigrants wanted to move there and found a country today would israel calmly negotiate the new borders or do something ridiculous like use force to try to prevent it >israel has been recognized as a sovereign state under international law so has palestine >you mean israel wants to seize gaza and absorb millions of hostile population who would be funded by its taxpayers no if i meant that i would have said it or said something that implied it but i didnt >more claim you dont have to believe it they are capable of doing that and have done that show proof that israel has previously removed hundreds of thousands of settlers from settlements >so what makes you think israelis want to annex all area c of west bank with hundreds of thousands palestinians living there who dont want to be a part of israel the massive ongoing expansion of settlements makes me think that israel wants to take large amounts of land from area c by expanding settlements it is objectively true that israel is doing this in order to attempt to acquire more territory look up whether or not the people in charge of doing it have directly stated this is why they are doing it for example >for me i still think it is laughable they want their grandfathers land back then what all of them live in israel a country that they hate yes you do think this like i already said you believe it to be laughable in one of the two circumstances and understandable in the other this is because you do not have consistent principles i see both as nonviable options and dont see the logic in a system that allows you to personally claim land back if you were not born there and didnt grow up there in the case of area c it should be palestine because it was intended to be and because israels aggressive expansionism beyond its internationally recognised borders and violation of the geneva convention by moving its own population onto occupied territory should be rejected on principle and to not set a precedent of allowing landgrabs by states >can you find out in the internet the percentage of israeli settlement in the area c and what is the majority of the land used for not really interested in your long winded version of the socratic method just make the actual point you want to make by saying it in words >first you have to show a proof that i claimed israel has offered to return area c in any negotiations the proof is the part of your previous comment where you said that the palestinians have to sit and negotiate if they want area c for this to be a possible option for them it has to be plausible that israel are willing to offer area c if they were they would have previously offered area c and so this is the only rational interpretation of your previous claim,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVlKc3VLT2dNSDZyMWJ6d2NsMFRvMUN2OEJjRGY4dDZFam92VkdTbVVHWXRRNGRiQm9qYklkN2NTY1c1MUcxRkhGN0lVdzN6MDhUTUlUeXpDa2t0dWJVaTJldTdzYy1BV2hHTVI1ZkhjcFU9

even if you believe the land belonged to the british and they have the right to give it to jews from every part of the word they literally did have that right this isnt some theoretical even if you believe its not about belief the entirety of that land literally belonged to the british palestinians didnt own any of it and because of such there was nothing illegal about the brits with the help of the un partitioning off their own land how they saw fit which in the original partition included the prioritization of giving palestinians sovereigntystatehood where they already lived the partition plan was for palis to own everything around jerusalem and the west bank the entire northern tip gaza and a huge swath of land south of gaza aka all of where palestinians already resided en masse there was less than <number> palestinians living there at the time of the british partition ffs and they were offered to rule over nearly <number> of all that land it was a generous deal jerusalem would be an international holy city that anyone could have access to and then the remaining land mostly rural would be given to neighboring jews and there was also a measure in place for a currency economic system which would bridge the two countries it was a plan that was meant to be a harmonious union between the two ethic groups who are ingenious to the land so that they could both have their own political and religious autonomy but also work together in other ways such as bridging their economies imagine hating jews so much that instead of having your own statehood economicpolitical sovereignty for the very first time outside of british rule that you launch a massive war and then spectacularly lose that war imagine well we dont have to imagine they actually did that,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOUdrSVlWMHlpWWR5M3Y2Q1dBa25fTndhbHNyZG1vcDBCQUgwNEFlWFFXS1lFSUVpMktDZmdma0ZzbUxCX0l3ZXhFTVR0TXE4bHpVa1RSNXVNWGxSWWJJVko3T3lhMDBRQk1PUGxyX1FfZ3c9

indeed it goes in circles in these conversations israelis have this problemexcuse well what about this problemexcuse for the palestinians which has almost exactly the same ideology or reasoning hypocrisy and an unwillingness to admit the wrongs of the side you pick is what keeps this cycle going as the old saying goes if they put down their guns there would be no war ultimately this violence is serving a few people who benefit greatly from it hamas are islamists with a horrible ideology and it is very very clear that they are genocidal maniacs driven by religion and power israel is an oppressive regime that justifies its brutal actions through victimhood and a shared western fear of islamism both sides leadership is granted power money and influence it serves them personally to make arms deals political networks and military operations and they have an army of global supporters cheering their bloodshed on in the name of justice i wonder when the day will come that we realise israelis and palestinians are cousins who have been abused for decades the only difference that i see is quality of life due to particular alliances i simply cannot and will not justify what they have done to each other its terrible we need to accept that horrible things have been done and agree that the only way to stop it is to forgive and move forward into a better future,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVGw5bm1yTzdOOGNkMUg1dl9Fa2daXy1GeDR4N2J6eERuTzFNbmNRbzlhNE9rZkp1SmNCQmNrVjlqTEEyUHpHTGJoUTFXOHBzMWpva05XaGp0QWo1UFZnQjhJaWVjMnJwaUJuOEJxdWZ6WkU9

not really since israel is an actual country what youre saying is also historically accurate because people did buy land legally but that was under the ottoman empire and then later during the british mandate of palestine some people want to form a new imaginary state of palestine which is a new level of radicalism that didnt even exist when they tried to limit the immigration of jews who they thought were buying too much land today they simply dont want the state of israel to exist at all,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN19EQVZIUDk4aDFtaXRLY2swXzVHY01MR2hiWG8wcWhOeHJzVWxLRUx6ZDVCTGt0X2VQNmF6TVN0TUNSOFI3N1FXd1N0MmZVbWZDWjFNUXlNbWxfbHc9PQ==
i agree ive had this idea for a while but if israel did more to bring back other lost tribes of israel that are being persecuted like igbo jews in nigeria who are being murdered by radical islamic extremists it would give israel more of a moral high ground to justify having a jewish state israel saving other groups from religious persecution would highlight a reason why we need a state and would make groups like hamas that want to wipe us out look even worse if we highlighted the persecution that jews go through globally i wish theyd implement that strategy not just for good pr but its just a factual reality,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQnVGZzhXUFlvN0dEVlNIWFlTdUhvMTlYSnRrdVNaYUZBZHd1VUpmRFF2WmN5c3JXUURrd2JoRmFiWl8wYk1KbkszSmYwbHE1Z3VKM3BOUVBjc0twanc9PQ==

the legal answer to your question is no israel cant just do whatever it wants to palestinians because it won the war kick them out etc its a violation of international law and norms essentially what youre arguing though is that might makes right which we realized after many horrific wars is not a good way to address conflict hence the aforementioned international law prohibiting this kind of behavior the other problem with this outlook is that it cuts both ways israel has the power to stop palestinians from ever having a state and it has the power to expel palestinians from their land on the flip side groups like hamas well maybe not so much now hezbollah and iran have the power to continue attacking and killing israelis so just because you have the power to do these things it doesnt mean its morally justified or that you should and in many cases it just leads to more conflict,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadDdfbEQ3cGJmdjBXZE9jeTEzMVN1ZU1tNTVLWThJSHJNTWcxb0xKMUh5Z05POGVaZFhDa2NmUEVCaFFpNF9Lc2FlZnhTWnRPNXQ4cmViWE0zZzRiRnc9PQ==

thats exactly the thing israelis dont care how someone would justify terrorism they merely try to defend themselves during active hostilities its easy to forget how much of what israel does is purely defensive in nature with onset of rocket attacks from gaza instead of destroying hamas israel invested into developing air defenses when hamas signaled they were tentatively ready to turn from attacking israel to administering gaza israel facilitated funding from qatar today palestinian supporters turn this into israel funded hamas only <number> days before the massacre israel and hamas agreed on deescalation prior to the war israel was constantly condemned for security checkpoints in wb the most effective antiterrorist measure and so on few people remember today israels operation in jenin only a year ago after a few days of heavy fighting with terrorists the number of civilian casualties stood at zero the result israel was condemned for second nakba because it requested population to leave for a few days and bullet holes in buildings i wish was joking it is true that the war and neverending conflict takes its toll there are all kinds of extremists in israel too and the government often cant afford to take a stand yet you are painting a very skewed picture of the conflict,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaazBtNFlXdGhQYXVPX3U2bHRhRjZEV0xpQUdwQWVMVWJDQW5BRjRnbzJEU01CY0FxYjFrZFRYbHZ3a1hlaGxsU3VFRWZQeGpxcmpoU2tpbnU5YTdwWmc9PQ==

i do keep up with the situation in israel and palestine and have done for many years now knowing what i know im aware that palestinian leadership has deflected every possible avenue for peace and that on a mass scale israel does what it can that was my general position before the shitshow of <number><number> however i cannot watch children die starved bombed shot and tell myself its necessary we should never get to that point and if we have to the first possible moment of peace should be grasped and enforced without outside forces constantly meddling advising and funding i dont believe hamas would have as much global influence as they do they are funded by iran and supported by people globally because first and foremost the amount of death and suffering is so painful to watch and they make sure you watch it while creating a political position which involves dehumanising and ignoring all zionist perspectives nonjewish zionists tend to have a special interest in defeating hamas who are a figurehead for islamism while yes we should do everything to end islamism many are simply islamophobic the money is in israel and thats why powerful countries and tech billionaires support them its all very superficial lets not forget the christian zionists of america who are only hoping to put jews in israel so they can bring about the second coming my point in saying all this is that outside meddling results in an ironically uneducated population with very very strong opinions that are generally not based in fact they always have a counter argument and will not listen and encourage the killing of their enemy while crying when their own are killed i simply hope for us to be reasonable people who say yes i understand why israel does what it does condemn the bad and do the same for palestinian leadership instead of going insane over lies and manipulations its driving me crazy because i cant even have a conversation about it with people i know anymore they all think i represent their enemy,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadjNJMDN4Uk1FNzc3VXRvV19tTk1jdHpWVHg0Wk8zMU5jcUpLN01CdDl1WDQ5dzV5T295cFNDWDBEZnFVQktFNUdmZEtJZjVmM0FhYjhBU1RBU1hFYnBoX3V0UVdmejVKc3Jjb0U5NVB1ZHM9

your comparison is incorrect this is a war between israel and hamas this isnt a terrorist attack on civilians no matter what some would like you to believe furthermore the tens of thousands of missiles sent by hamas against israel citizens did not cause tens on thousands of casualties because of the iron dome and shelters israel has sent a considerable amount in securing its civilians that doesnt dismiss the regular attacks by hamas putting hundred of thousands in fear or rockets landing on them and then there are regular attempts of terror attacks blocked by checkpoint and blockades israel is always seen as not suffering because it has grown very good at protecting itself often that protection comes at a price to the palestinians all the world sees is the price the palestinians pay and ignore how we got there people like playing the numbers game because it makes israel looks like the bad guy all it really shows is that israel is good at protecting itself it has to be when there are others with a goal to destroy it,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX2tSbGIySEFjaGpwWDBkMzVXaXBsN1lmR1pCdWJMeEtHVFdad0VUSnJBYWR6QmFlVjhvYXFtNDEyZUptaGZuMy1xZm5kc3loNUV3RUR1aEJnWnIwWEE9PQ==

if youre actually military competent military you probably know the phrase big hand small map you also probably know the how war is usually understood on several different layers strategic operational and tactical how israel has managed this conflict on a strategic level is not good this is an excerpt from a conversation with an american lone soldier and an older israeli citizen <url> > one woman whose age i dont want to guess but clearly had a ton of life experience was telling me a bit about her life when i asked her when the first time she came to israel was > <number> she informed me with a knowing grin > she kept repeating a sentence it was very peaceful back then not like today > did people interact with their arab neighbors though > oh yes many people even spoke arabic and they were quite friendly with each other it wasnt until the <number> war the <number> day war that this changed before then it was different there wasnt an occupation then first point of note here the security picture has deteriorated dramatically over time despite israel being far more established and capable as a state continuing on > post massage i was enjoying a smoke with a couple of other american lone soldiers when one of the masseuses who had lived in chicago and spoke great english joined our little smoking circle and began demanding of us one thing > youre all staying in israel after this right > the awkward truth is that none of us were planning on staying in israel after all this i can and will go into this in detail at a later time but in summary and what i told her was that i didnt want my now oneyearold son to have to grow up and join the idf in what was clearly an endless war > we dont have a choice she insisted in response my boys can already shoot a bow and arrow they will grow up and fight we only have one place to live where we are safe what else can we do > this is the israel of today where mothers are ready to sacrifice their children to a war machine whose hunger will never be satisfied > for some reason hearing her say this reminded me of the jonestown mass suicide in <number> when nearly one thousand people willingly killed themselves out of loyalty to a home and way of life > men women old young mothers even fed their babies the poison to ensure they would die together i always wondered how these parents could do such a thing yet here i was talking to a woman who was boasting about her childrens fighting prowess and proudly declaring that they would be warriors in an endless jewish jihad from which they could not hope to escape there are religious currents in israeli society that cant be dismissed which fundamentally alters how israel pursues war on a strategic level we really need to start paying more attention to that <url> > religious zionism despite its relatively modest electoral clout has become a powerful ideological formation in contemporary israel and is now in a favorable position to establish cultural hegemony over jewish israeli society as a whole > following the <number> arabisraeli war rabbi kook forbade giving up any part of the land of israel which he believes is granted to the people of israel by god this prohibition provided the ideological basis for gush emunim the israeli settler movement that succeeded in transforming the demography of the west bank and making the twostate solution to the israelipalestinian conflict obsolete this kind of territorial maximalism is something closer to what youd see in serbia not nato and certainly not the eyes countries this renders a realistic acceptable endstate negotiated peace with the palestinians out of the question so israel has been reduced to absolutely absurd tactical measures like roof knocking to try not to alienate foreign support because they have no path to victory on a strategic level which the international community could possibly accept the strategic logic is absolutely incoherent in israel to accommodate this religiousnationalist imperative as if civilian settlements in the west bank somehow create security on october th something like <number> battalions were deployed towards judea and samaria while something like <number> protected the gaza border > other tactics that seem absurd even to the most restrained nato forces such as calling civilian mobiles warning before a strike the use of leaflets to move civilians to safety these tactics are absurd because nato fields expeditionary forces working to attain achievable political goals rather than trying to institutionalize permanent occupation with a minimal troop presence to be fair israel is the most advanced country in the world at achieving this questionable goal it has brought israel nothing but misery so lets emphasize that point again israel in <number> used to be a peaceful place what went wrong,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTXBtTUlsc3Vud01Pa2ZwR3hvenFDbzRiWHlDTTFLdjZuaXRWM0JILVFINi0tYnZOUF8xVVJfTzl0cFBrR1FLLWUwQXlvYmdnM3E3WWdZb2owdnJfdllZTEdJYVByVU5PZHMteU5CQ1RLODQ9

than every single arab and muslim country in the world palestinians have mentioned several times they dont want jews to live in a future palestinian state >they wanted to create a jewish majority state on an already populated land with or without the consent of the locals already populated is bs people were migrating in and out and moving around all the time case in point is that jews used to be populated there and were forcibly removed those k were living under ottoman rule and the population significantly increased after jews started moving there starting at the end of the s >they ethnically cleansed k palestinan from their homes an event documented in un resolution <number> iii the un is severely biased against jews and did not document or care about the displacement of the jews >th of may is an official nakba day in un the nakba was the result of arab rejection of jews and subsequent war and attempt at genocide arab states outnumber israel in the un and use their natural resources as leverage to pressure other states to vote against jews arab states have atrocious human rights records compares to israel orders of magnitude more people have been displaced by arabs than by jews even now <number> million people were displaced in sudan >jordan is not palestine different countries with different people before is was called jordan it was called transjordan and before transjordan the region was palestine more than half of the people living in jordan are palestinian the hashemite rulers are not natives >and <number> partion plan wanted to divide the land which meant palestinians would lose their homes it also had a section saying thst k palestinian must be removed from the jewish part you think palestinans should accept that yes i think if they would have accepted it then less people would die and there would be peace being displaced <number> miles away is more humane than allowing millions to die >it is a fact that jews lived peacefully under muslim rule jews experienced their golden age in muslim spain hundreds of jewish scientists politicans rabbis and philosphers came from muslim spain it is not a fact we were at best tolerated there were good times and there were plenty of bad times my entire community in mashhad iran was forced to convert >although islamic civliazation wasnt perfectbut antisemtisim is a eurpean problem today antisemitism is a muslim problem more than a european problem you think a jew dressed fully as a jew is safer in a random arab country than in europe the vast majority of hate crimes against jews in europe and the us are made by muslims >it is a fact now that jews killed muslims more than what muslims killed from jews in the last <number> years hahahhahahahhahahahahbagahahahahhahhahahahahahahhahhhahaaaaaaaaa thats absolutely insane look at the population of jews in muslim countries over the past <number> years if jews would dare resist islamic rule we would be exterminated immediately >in the latest gaza genocide the lancet are saying thst k were killed by israel even of the number is k it doesnt come close to the number of jews killed by muslims in the last <number> years of islam yes because there are less jews in the world than muslims so when muslims kill a million people during their conquests you can say they only killed a few jews how many people have been killed in the name of islam in the past <number> years vs by jews >thsts a form of racism ro assume that palestinians are same as lebanese morrocansetc palestinians are not the same as morrocans but galilee palestinians are closer to lebanese than to gazans also even though not the same they practice the same religion and speak the same language

it says phoenicianscanaanite peoples ancestries are mixed you already rejected this above and called me obsessed >in order for this to happen the radicalist settler ideology of zionism needs to be rejected or be reformed israeli government must pay compensations for palestinian refugees for their stolen homes this cannot and will not happen with hamas in power because its against their ideology its also against irans ideology as well and they are the local superpower believe it or not israelis would love to live beside a peaceful country of arabs as soon as uae normalized everyone started visiting >for sure palestinan side also needs to work on it and deradicalize but the main oppressor israel is the one thst needs to be reformed because it is the main source of violence and the one thst had monopoly over violence israel is not the main source of violence its a progressive and diverse country without a death penalty and with protections for all of its people including arabs its a

thats what war is everyone understands what war is and involves unless it comes to israel if any other countrys government sent thousands of rockets at another country the first concern of the attacked country would be how to stop them and prevent more from coming in which means war which means people die because war is about making sure the enemy would be incapacitated and cant attack your country again israel not only dealt with them for almost <number> years because of the defensive iron dome they had constant terror attacks and then oct <number> just one of these things let alone all of them would have prompted a brutal retaliation as seen with the us and <number><number> and that was just one terror attack but a all of a sudden when it comes to israel people turn into drooling idiots who cant understand this and get upset that israel doesnt have the magical ability to prevent civilian deaths and of course no blame is put on hamas for starting the war and then not protecting civilians in the miles of tunnels and you and others even blame israel for hamas even though they couldnt see the future and considering that no one cares about putin bombing ukraine or saudi arabia bombing yemen you can bet that no one would care if hamas decided to shoot rockets at another country and gaza got bombed in response and we all know why people suddenly care when it comes to israel you can shout and scream all you want but israel is going to protect its citizens like any other country would and jews are quite used to double standards what with people deciding that some of us working in banking means we control the world and all,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSnJHRG1uX0RGemlOY2lxQmRraGdYR05vaVZqRmxwVGNGd0JzNkFtb3hYcFE4cXF0RnEtWW1xeE9pOWZIYkFhN0ltN0loZUI5THFRNVhHdk14RXg3eThzbEtfeGtzakZwOFZuTUdNbURhWXc9

> israel didnt do anything to make it a less peaceful pleasant place for arabs israel has conducted the longest belligerent occupation on earth thats something israelis struggle to be honest about this because ending the occupation creates a rift between israelis who prioritize a democratic state and israelis who prioritize a religiousnationalist mission to settle the biblical land of israel most people outside israel saw the assassination of yitzhak rabin as the act of a deranged radical in <number> at this point theres a reassessment that the killer was simply at the sharp end of an ultranationalist religiouspolitical movement that has only grown stronger how are you going to blame the arabs for this yasser arafat didnt shoot rabin he shook his hand and pledged the right of the state of israel to exist in peace and security things fell apart but its not meaningless that was put in writing and signed the arabs are not the only people to be looked at here while israelis make excuses for everything you want international support fix your country dont try and fool westerners its insulting,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY2JkYnVjT0VhWUJHSGxBT2VvRkltRDRYVWZfOHJXUFJuZk45Qko3ZGRVSG1PRmJxSjRPRkNnMXdQSjlTZ3U4cmoxZ2hRTFZDdFRxVFFaNUFGWk9qRVFGalhQRUJmUG9VNWtFVjlySlBHUVU9

i agree its about pr but its not just that my theory is that people are far more likely to know a muslim person than they are to know a jewish or israeli person this is because there are more than x more people who practice islam in the world than judaism while there are muslims who are not propalestine and jews who are antizionism this is commonly not the case most muslims are propalestine it is psychologically proven that the people that surround us highly impact our views and who we empathize with all of this to say i believe it is due to the sheer proportion of muslims in the world compared to the very small number of jews that many people now seem to be propalestine biases are so important and as a university student in psychology i can honestly say that our biases have more of an impact than we think and they are failing us for credibility and integrity reasons im trying to remain impartial however as someone with loved ones on both sides this is proving to be ever more difficult,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeEJ3NmNpX1NMMXFfZDlKSW1ManpNbmQ5NWFzWEFnRVFPNlk0bHNLZkZ0VmRRTDNzQWpsRDFsM0tFQ0daNEljcWgyeEo0VmZLckZjMGN0TjlvYVRhLWc9PQ==

you dont have to be a biblical scholar to know what he is referring to when he mentions amalek i am not one by any means and i know the story if instead only say a fraction of the amalekites were marked for annihilation i would maybe give netanyahu the benefit of the doubt but that is not the case i obviously cant understand ancient hebrew so i dont know if there are any translation differences i need to know about between that and the english version of the story but given how it ends i cant imagine it exactly calls for restraint towards women children and animals and yeah i am very well aware that the people running hamas are unhinged maniacs they are religious extremists this is not news to me i disagree that the comparison to amalek is vague given what happened to them if you want to talk about specifically destroying a terrorist organization that is a terrible metaphor to use,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUmpqc054cVRwMXFyVjhEeGxJSXczbHVxOWJiYUNoNmVOcWtwTHppUjdab3JyMFlwa2tTQlRtZ29sVmNXN0RDOU0yOTkwbjZKUjlORXdBZDN2Vml4RnBmbmx4dGNzejNWNXNqTHBkM2RSekk9

i think the point of the genetics thing is to point out that both jews and palestinians as people are from long lines of people who lived in the levant so characterizing either group as simple invaders just because jews were displaced for a long time palestinians became arabized for a long time isnt fair basically while they are different cultures now and have strayed geographicallyculturally from their ancient roots they come from the same source they also still look the same and have a fair amount in common culturally so its a shame that they characterize each other as foreign invaders rather than long lost cousins,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNab0R5Q3NJQjRsTGkzT0VTOHNpNXp5WHVJeTN4eVZfNmQ4OERhaVBLcnZnbFprNjBQaDFkc2dKRFB1X3hVN3k4Vzk4elVNOHZUaHE3UC0tQ19IdC02bGc9PQ==

i do care that innocents were killed but it was the direct results of hamas acting with perfidy whether or not israel set that area aside previously as safe is irrelevant it was hamas that made the area unsafe according to all laws of armed conflict this is a war sometimes in war countries need to make a choice in order to achieve military objectives israels military objectives are to rescue hostages and to kill the military branch of hamas especially their leaders hamass military objective is to make it impossible to do so without killing civilians sinwar calls it a necessary sacrifice that will lead to hamas victory <url> so its actually hamas not me that does not care about civilian deaths if hamas did care about civilian lives they would not violate the laws of armed conflict to shoot rockets next to them they would not violate the laws of armed conflict to hide underneath of them they would not hide their weapons in their homes and schools they would not establish bases in hospitals note that israel does not do these things this is properly described by hamas frequently israel loves life hamas loves death if hamas loved life they would not behave the way that they do and i wish that hamas would not have started this war i wish they would not have cynically endangered their civilians i wish that they did not rape and murder en masse what was the strategic military goal of nova of the stealing of kfir bibas of taking holocaust survivors from their kitchens and living rooms and bringing them into tunnels there was none i can tell you the military utility of placing their high level officers underneath civilians its to shield these officers from attack because killing civilians hurts israel not hamas and i can tell you why other militaries dont do it because they actually care about their own people is your complaint that hamas isnt protecting gazans so you expect israel to do it for them,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTEZTT2hGdTQ2YVpNalpaem1rQ20xVkI4bU5zYkZXQlF3NWV6c0U5b3BMclY5dGdGeWc0MUpvaXRuX0JOS2VLdTNsN05LeXp4U28yYWNlWmVpeXREQXc9PQ==

if you dont want to believe that hamas did everything ive mentioned then you are simply ignoring what the truth is as for al shifa there is a documented firefight between idf and hamas forces hamas was firing at the idf from within the al shifa hospitals i could say the exact same things about palestinian tiktok support efforts as many of the supposed affected victims on tiktok asking for support run on the exact same script word for word there are leaked messages of influencers that were paid by hamas and some of the videos that ive seen on youtube by vox is written and supervised by a director of the plo the fact is if you look at the evidence that proves that hamas is firing explosive weapons from residential buildings an entrance to a hamas tunnel this is covered by both the left and right media its undisputed and they steal humanitarian aid for weapons this isnt israeli propaganda its just what they do denying this is the equivalent of me saying that all of the civilians dying is them putting their selves in harms way because i saw one video of a palestinian father encouraging idf soldiers to shoot his son while he is holding a palestinian flag this is real it is intellectually dishonest to dismiss these very truths your current view of hamas is idealistic and is unfortunately not the truth israel has a responsibility to minimize civilian casualties as much as hamas has a responsibility to take care of their own citizens hamas knows that they are going to be bombed and yet they still hide within their civilian population the fact is if hamas didnt hide within their civilian population and built military bases outside of the civilian populations then the war would already be over if you will read them im more than willing to provide sources to back everything i said about hamas,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadmg1TjV6UWlLNGVHbDdiMkFWNEgxcWx6ZGFiZ25wb0E3NTBrMUxDVmc1ZURWMGNfdW9xS01RQy0yajhaQjFsU2pQVDRtbnVwSEQ3NG5jN3BxU1JtakE9PQ==

israel is mostly jews and people who claim to just be against israel end up attacking worldwide the warsaw ghetto was part of the deliberate killing of jews because they were jews not because there was a jewish military shooting rockets into germany and blowing themselves up in public to murder germans hamas is the elected government of gaza and is therefore declaring war on israel with every rocket and terror attack and we know that any other country wouldnt take that lying down and would most probably stop supplying food and water the fact that hamas attacks the country that supplies gaza with food and water in the first place and doesnt get any blame for that is unbelievable enough but when people just blame israel for everything and not egypt which also has a border with gaza and when people dont criticize hamas for digging up water pipes to turn them into rockets and not providing food or electricity despite the billions from unwra and when people act like this is the most horrible conflict despite russia bombing ukraine and theres no outrage and tens of millions of people displaced and facing hunger in sudan yemen and syria and theres not a peep jews get suspicious and as everyone ignores israel left gaza in <number> which is how hamas was elected in the first place and for almost <number> years has just gotten rockets and terror attacks and still supplied basic necessities and let gazans in to work but after oct <number> and the fact that unwra has decided for decades that the label of refugee is inherited by palestinians and trapped them in that refugee mindset instead of seeking to resettle them means that this conflict cant be solved that easily,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWtCdG9sR0dhNVhjV3lOd3dLMTlOcGxUNFdfUzNRb042Tk81bEo2UDdac2NBOUxrUC1zQ25kdDVqREltbjNTMkdzY1hHZWxabWh4UlF5ajVtMXJMX1J4cG0xQlpIYVZ0a2VRWGtTWS02b3M9

i think that some ops who post posts like these do provide a lot of citations it seems possible that every fact in the ops post is correct the problem is with the way the op lumps all palestinians together and ignores the kind of moderate palestinian perspective a zionist like me could imagine having if i were a palestinian being a zionist should mean keeping israel safe not being cruel or unjust towards the palestinians its hard for someone on a different wavelength to read a post like that because its so distasteful i think that jewish israelis deserve to be safe and happy and not to deal with insane attacks hateful propaganda and other forces clearly do affect how hamas leaders are proceeding but posts like the top post here are so nasty onesided and prejudiced that they make israel and zionists look bad and undermine people who just want israelis to have the same kind of right not to be blown up or go into airraid shelters that all of us including palestinians in palestine should have also the arguments about palestinian culture might be potentially relevant to how we make peace but have no bearing on the need to try to make peace we dont have to try to make peace with the palestinians because from our perspective theyre nice and reasonable we have to try to keep trying to make peace with them as long as we and they exist because theyre human beings and their children are blameless,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUG9JaWlvR3gxVU5DejdVeGlXSkJiRWJZbG1iQTF5T3lCcDdJak81YV81c3BwcVhzVWJwTVBldXQ0d0h2Yk5lbmNtRGhWaDZFZTY1ZGpOUlFxTExzM1E9PQ==

theres a really simple explanation for this and im not even going into history bc thats so contested israel holds the power in this palestineisrael conflict and they could make decisions to lessen the anger and hatred towards them from the palestinians and the rest of the world people see what israel has been doing in the west bank for decades occupation administrative detentions building settlements palestinian demolitions allowing settler violence restricting building essentially pushing palestinians off their land im not going to go into the current situation in gaza which is horrific bc hamas is fighting not only for the lifting the blockade from gaza but for the end of the occupation in the wb i dont support hamas or their tactics but israel is the super power literally the easiest thing they could do is stop building more settlements and make life a little easier for palestinains stop home demolitions make getting building permits easier for them for a start these are things that dont jeopardize israeli citizen security and theres no reason for these policies other than getting the palestinians off the land this would at least start a trust building process stop giving the palestinians a reason to fight them,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMllxRDJtQk5ESVlPX1I5X0lmdGdHbEZfb2FUWUs5Qm1ZSHNGamZDNE9EUmQtai04NmZ5SkZWZ1BlUlp3ZDBWdllSWjl6V3JBa2Exb3V6NEF4RkpoYlE9PQ==

actually i think it was done for demographic reasons >also they didnt really let the arabs have it they enacted a land sea and air blockade the occupation simply shifted from within gaza to around gaza an occupation from outside isnt an occupation at all there is no such thing thats just called a blockade gaza needed to be blockaded because gaza attacks israel so its natural to limit their weapons in response,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMERZdGo1a0V3dXpJR3VXeHBEdk80Vkp1Q3BEdHN4YXhHZ1lXV1NhMlFMemlZSDR3bXVIUzJnYVQtU2hlOFBwRi1sdW5YWjhaem85eVZobnA3M0hMMWc9PQ==

i think its a mixture for example many people might have negative perspectives on ghetto culture in america because of its associated violence violence is certainly a valid reason on its face to be negative towards something they might also have such perspectives mitigated to a significant degree by engaging with people from these communities to understand the struggles they have and how circumstances largely outside of their control contribute to cycles of violence implicit and explicit biases are not mutually exclusive and the former often informs the latter i think ops theory is likely not going to be <number> applicable but i dont think they intend it to be its just one of many factors to consider playing into the current situation,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYmh2S1F6cHk5eDFvLTFkSk9xSzdxRnduSEszYnFUb25oUEljWFEtLUtiaGhBNWx4aEZRd0ZNa1JVSXpZTW8xWnlFVC15WXZzcU1veXpmQmtOQzNCN0RKQThwYzQyUXdUaXRhZ2U2bUs1RkU9

well its the combination of taking it in the war then jordan relinquishing claim to it the legal premise in war at that time was that land claimed during war was occupied and couldnt be annexed but could be held until peaceful plans were created and at that time the land is to be returned until that point legally it belongs to those it was taken from and is only militarily occupied by relinquishing territorial claim in <number> before peace agreements were finally made in <number> after decades of armistice a separate thing it was then land israel had control over that was no longer actually claimed by those it was taken from so the rules about not being allowed to lay claim to territory obtained in war were different since jordan said they didnt want it back of course jordans intention was for it to be sovereign land for a new palestinian state but legally that wasnt necessarily their decision to make given the circumstances the grey area still yes morally i think it definitely should have been and looking forward should become a fully independent palestinian state,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzVfUElKZlo2cGtaNllaZi1FY2xFd0kydC1SaXVsRkVoR2hLNG5YMnVNUzRmZmtDRTQydmFYYjlxdm1FUVo3QmYwOVpMZUFfc0VhMVpFNzMzcUt6enpfYnhfUEVCWnY0bW5ucWNBd0NpRzA9

i have read south africas case i think it would need to be clearly stated that its israels policy andor because i acknowledge a genocidal entity might never say so the actions relative to capability reflect genocidal intent in gazas case given full capability to do so with current weaponry this would be killing without care for civilian casualties that would make it clear civilian casualties were intent and not in fact just casualties of war effectively wed need to see a death rate that mirrors the population with no discrimination at all towards military personnel while the death rate is certainly high at this time there is even at the most sceptical of numbers a disproportionate number of hamas militia dead relative to civilians based on hamas given numbers of <number> total dead and <number> acknowledged dead militia <number> months ago this gives about a <number> death rate being militants even if no more have died since then relative to militants making up approximately <number><number> of the total gaza population clear discrimination and focus on militants,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWFZzQkNYbW9wX2ZJbS1CVE04M2JaeFZZUi05TDVXOHdRU2RzMXY0bnFnM1MtNXdfRjI3MEZjd2JEN0huQmJxRFlXVnFmeTFOS3U1RF9US2s2VkpQbHhweERoUGVuQ0lUUjlrZmZtd1FXZUk9

>since palestine is the aggressor in the conflict like russia no one should care if they lose their homes civilians should not be deliberately made to suffer for the actions of their governments unless it is absolutely essential for someones survival i support ukraine and id support my government sending them ten times the aid it is now but if ukraine took back all their land advanced into russia and started destroying entire cities my support would evaporate overnight and id demand that my government pressured them into agreeing a ceasefire russians should perhaps have done more to try to oppose putin but that doesnt mean its right for them to lose their homes until thats the last possible option to prevent ukraine from being destroyed palestinians who didnt actively aid hamas in their invasion do not deserve to suffer either and should not lose their homes or their lives unless that is the only way israel can possibly survive every single missile bomb rocket artillery shell and bullet fired by israel and ukraine should be aimed at a known military target and if that isnt the case they should be held to account and yes im aware that many palestinians apparently support hamas according to answers given to surveys but thats happening inside peoples heads if they werent holding prisoners or making rockets or carrying ammo then they cannot be targeted punishing thoughtcrimes is a straight path to fascism even voting for hamas doesnt make them any more culpable than americans or brits who voted for bush or blair would be for the invasion of iraq and nobody calls to punish voters for that despite the horrific outcome,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMHR1OV9Hd2VQMk5CRmxyU3ROcEdJNlJzaUxQMWZYaG9YQjdXWnZSOHhGNVR1MmZ1TVFkd0YyLWdvMnEtWlJtMHVkUHdLeTJDSzYtRWhFZzAwNGo4bFV6RXBXd21xTXNwaFFZYUs0OENIWEU9

i dont think russia did respond to a perceived threat there isnt really any conceivable threat that would make sense because russia has nukes and so cannot be invaded even if anyone in the west did want to which they dont the whole thing about basing nukes in ukraine was on nobodys agenda and was never done with the other nato states bordering russia and in fact nato had a policy of deliberately only placing token tripwire forces in the baltic states to avoid antagonising them which cant really fight but include troops from major nato states so if russia invaded theyd be attacking those major countries and the alliance would all get pulled in i think its as simple as putin wanting to pad his legacy through conquest he thought the invasion would be easy because his generals told him it would be and because the west didnt do anything concrete about the annexation of crimea,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZDZXWnE2ekZBYVFXT3ZfS29WR3VGVG5vS1ZkM3NlMWljaFNTT1NwcHZMbW51ZFlqaDBsTjhpTEM5U0oxWHgteGJpMzhOOUxyVWlnSXJMQUdJOGpyMDBGWXk1djRjbFV3b2JFMzJHcE45dUk9

are you kidding have you ever learned a daf gemora you reminded me of this excerpt from the empty wagon by rabbi yakov shapiro >mashal a reform rabbi decides he wants to see what a real yeshiva is like so one day he walks into a large yeshiva gedolah and spends an entire day there until the end of second seder after the bochurim and yungeleit leave for dinner break he goes over to the rosh yeshiva all upset >i dont understand dont your students have anything better to do all day besides talk about reform jews >the rosh yeshiva puzzled asks the reform clergyman what he is talking about to which he replies >i walked around the bais hamedrash during first seder and the boys were learning tractate rosh hashanah they were talking about a karkafta dlo manach tefillin someone who never donned tefillin see they were talking about reform jews we dont put on tefillin and they were saying terrible things about us poshei yisroel bgufan and then they were busy the whole time talking about what exactly we are and how bad it is >and then during second seder they were learning shabbos they have nothing else to talk about except how someone who doesnt keep shabbos gets skilah and about all the petty little things someone does that makes him a mechalel shabbos >all day theyre talking about us people who cook on shabbos people who carry on shabbos people who tie knots on shabbos doesnt a yeshiva have anything better to teach their people than railing a whole day against reform is antireform suddenly one of the ikrei emunah that you spend so much time on it >obviously the purpose of learning judaism is not per se in order to oppose reform but given that reform opposes judaism if someone learns about judaism he is necessarily going to learn things that oppose reform >it is the same with zionism antizionist jews are no more antizionist than they are antireform or antipaganism or antibaal worship or antiatheism imagine if instead of reform and orthodox we would use the terms reform and antireform that certainly would not portray an accurate picture of the relationship between reform and the other religions reform is one religion and orthodox judaism is another one can believe in reform judaism or deny it just as one can believe any heresy one can practice it or not casting the issue as reform and antireform would not properly express that >so too it does not convey an accurate picture when we refer to zionists and antizionists its like calling eliyahu hanavi an antibaal worshipper it conceals the fact that eliyahus like the rest of the antibaalworshippers opposition to baal worship wasnt a position in and of itself but rather a manifestation of his belief in torah judaism >antizionism is the same as antibaal worship its just torah judaism not a position in and of itself furthermore it was not judaism that came out against zionism but zionism that came out against judaism judaism was there first and then zionism was created as an ideology hostile to it that nuance is lost when we describe the battle against zionism as zionism versus antizionism >i am not against zionism because i have something against zionism per se i am against zionism because i am in favor of judaism i am a torahabiding jew it is zionism that is against me zionism is against my religion zionism was designed to erase my religion steal its identity and then impersonate it the truth is even if i were not a religious jew i would still disdain zionism as even from a practical perspective it brings about nothing but suffering,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadkwzb25pUUprWkZXYm8yTlUwdThjQTF6Vkhyd2VUSGllczREMGVVX3BEdldVeHVjam1pYlIzajZ6RnAxUnBFUjdqLXdYclZaNzJFVDlsb25nTUlXZ2c9PQ==

what youre failing to realize is that international relations as with all things in this universe is governed by casualty cause and effect action reaction the israelis spent over five decades trying to offer the palestinians statehood and conceding land to a new state they helped the bourgeoning state organize develop and run elections they provided them utilities because they lacked the resources andor motivation to build them themselves to this day palestine is the only state on earth to have all of its public utilities provided and paid for by another nation israel established the largest work visa program in the history of humanity to provide opportunities for palestinians to come work in israel and earn better livings in order to foster upward mobility even though it came at great risk to israel ultimately israel offered them six different proposals that would have granted palestine official statehood the most generous of which offered palestine <number> of the contested area despite all of this every single offer was rejected with spite disdain and malice and inevitably answered with war and terrorism palestine spent decades attacking israel while israel attempted to help them and while israel was busy granting citizenship to millions of palestinians and thats not even taking into account the absolutely brutal ways in which the palestinians treated the jews prior to the establishment of the state of israel so yes the israeli citizens got tired of the double standards they got tired of being told theyre supposed to be ethical responsible members of society and that theyre morally obligated to help their palestinian neighbors while the palestinians continue to attack them enact constitutions fundamentally denying the right of israelis to exist teaching their kids that jews are evil and should be killed with absolutely no accountability or expectations of civility they got disheartened when they withdrew from gaza in <number> only to have the palestinians elect hamas the next year and start bombing israel relentlessly and to add insult to injury theyre told theyre just supposed to accept their gazan neighbors relentlessly launching missiles at them daily for <number> years and if they so much as suggest israel should try to stop them theyre monsters they got fed up and they started electing leaders who would take a more nationalist stance this is the way all nations react to political leaders who dont prioritize their own citizens weve seen it in britain with brexit the recent success of the far right in sweden le pen in france and in the us with trump these are all referendums by the people against governments who for too long dont put their own peoples well being first,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSUVBR2VoYnhmNVR1STJzeE9KVjAtR29rWTExMlpDdXJFVXBWRDFTMy1LaHlod29tRU1XeGVJRHZzeDZYZGpvejM4QmllZDJLbGhCS25FWUczT2dlQ0E9PQ==

thats your own distorted version of it you also just proved you arent student of the talmud because the word zionism came from zion which is jerusalem and or israel zionism was a secular movement no doubt because you fail to recognise jews as an ethnicity when they rounded us up during the pogroms they didnt ask if we are orthodox or secular they rounded us up for who we are not what we believed busha typical religious zealot that thinks anyone that doesnt follow the book isnt living up to being jewish,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMFVSVHJ0SHZRV3dzU0sxTlY3NG91NmtqWW9CVENDdWxZZWl2LTd6SEFLVXgybV96VHo3S212SFFBYzVVaFJDdWRJZ1FkN3FuNnBTY2pWV1ZjM3hHcFE9PQ==
yes every jew <number> years ago only identified as jewish because they were religious or raised in a religious homecommunity a jew who chose to stop being religious even though he would be considered a jew as per judaism would almost always convert to another religion because socially he could not justify calling himself jewish without keeping the basics this common mindset amongst even the most rebellious jews was the core impetus behind reform for example that couldnt just say a jew could be a jew without keeping kosher and shabbos etc rather the movement had to innovate a redefinition of judaism into be a jew at home and a german on the street all because no one would swallow the foolishness of someone calling themselves jewish without some sort of religious standard,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU2w1WTdlajFoNURrYWJJTVBUMTYyYllaejgtR0FyWG5pbzZyd3dMakxtVlVfMjdxSTEyOVhjTEU3aEd4blZjTU1oUWNTMVhsaElZLWNLR1UtSUpCNFE9PQ==

ill be honest with you i havent met that many zionists in real life most of my interactions with them happened online so maybe i was just talking to the bad apples i cant say that i know everything there is to know about israel but i have educated myself quite a bit since the start of the conflict and i have done some extensive research on both the israeli and palestinian narrative to get the general talking points of each side i think the problem lies in the fact that neither side is ever willing to acknowledge or condemn their sides crimes the palestinians will usually legitimize whatever terrorism perpetuated by their side as resistance to the oppression forces and the israelis will defend their governments war crimes against the palestinians basically say something along the lines of oh its our only way to remain safe both sides will spread nasty lies about the other however since israel is the uss biggest ally mainstream western media will repeat israeli propaganda sometimes without even factchecking it like the <number> beheaded babies hoax in general i have found a lot of people that spread lies regarding oct <number> in an attempt to legitimize the terror inflicted against gaza right now im not trying to deny the oct <number> attacks i condemn the use of violence against any civilians but what im not okay with is spreading lies that exacerbate it to try to dehumanize all palestinians as human animals in order to justify their massacre maybe iran will spread prohamas propaganda but lets be honest who tf watches iranian news outlets i also find it ironic that you complain so much about the generalization yet will claim that most palestinians support the oct <number> attacks only the radical palestinians will support the death of innocent civilians on that day most that ive spoken with understand why hamas did what they did but they dont approve of their methods especially considering the outcome of the attack the west bank for example doesnt have hamas and has faced growing settler violence after oct <number> but youre right this conversation is going nowhere mostly because we have one major point that we dont agree on i believe that both sides have committed atrocities and that the occupation needs to end and that both sides need radical change for peace to occur which i personally cant see happening any time soon you believe that israel is never in the wrong and that israel only acts in self defence i dont believe its your problem i believe both societies have been radicalized to hate each other it makes sense that people hate the people that hate them but i would say that if you truly want compromise maybe try to objectively look at it from their perspective try to understand why they would hate you id say the same thing to a palestinian once again i dont harbour any hatred against you this is just the society that you were raised in so you having your opinions makes sense i dont expect to change your entire world view with this <number> comment stay safe remember to always challenge your beliefs,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQnYtcU5uNGl4SzNVSVNJZUhjdmVfNDhSTWdxcm5jMURYWGRBZ1VwYTdYa1I0aGw3UkV5ZlJVQzh0MFUyZVR4YjR3dGh6Tmd2QXRZWmlUYkE0NWlsWlE9PQ==

hi  as a rd party reading this conversation it does seem that your main argument is based on rhetoric and only carefully cherrypicked rhetoric taken from israeli leadership who are clearly expressing themselves while stressed and frustrated comments such as netanyahus amalek comment is also taken out of context and as pointed out rhetoric doesnt equate to policy on strategic and tactical policy we thankfully have an abundance of expert military analysts from across the world who generally consent that the idf are doing more to avoid civilian casualties than any other military in history not only do these world leading military analysts and intelligence agencies disagree with your concept but actually praise israel for minimizing civilian deaths in what is the most intense urban combat environment ever recorded are you aware that the idf hasnt bombed any hospitals they have raided and cleared hospitals using ground and airborne forces to engage incombant millitants fortified inside and underneath hospitals and significant damage has resulted but that is quite different to bombing hospitals israel has also built <number> lage capacity field hospitals stoked with thousands of ltrs of donated blood because it was found that hamas restricts blood supplies to civilian hospitals are you aware that the current gaza war has the lowest civilian death rate of any urban combat environment while simultaneously being recognized as the most difficult to achieve such a limitation this article is written by john spencer who is widely regarded as the worlds leading expert on urban warfare <url> are you aware that the latest un special report has stated that there is no evidence of an impending famine in gaza and that there is actually <number> pallets approximately <number> trucks worth of food and aid that is cleared by idf security and stockpiled while it waits for aid agencies to distribute it and that distribution is mainly limited by hamas piracy it is important on subjects such as this that we take on the statements of experts rather than random misinformation that fits our preconceptions veteran analyst ehud yaari a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy said this hamas redirects at least <number> of all aid entering gaza and has profited in excess of <number> million dollars doing so,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVzZNNzROYm11STQ1cFBLNUk3QUl0MVByVTJ4VXhYRmYxdlRrMU1wQWpnajdOTW5icWVmUTBzMG43eWZIcXlJRGd0VE1uTTBVaWRCeFd0Mkl3NDNfZHc9PQ==

it was a simple yes or no question nuance is important but its not even what you do your argument fundamentally relies on a double standard that is not morally or legally defensible under international law you assert that all life is precious yet you justify the bombing of a humanitarian camp because a highvalue target is present dismissing the value of palestinian civilian lives in the process this is contradictory lets address your points if all lives are indeed precious then the principle must be applied uniformly bombing a humanitarian camp knowing it will result in civilian casualties cannot be justified any more than bombing an israeli kibbutz under similar circumstances the nationality of the civilians does not change the ethical or legal calculus international humanitarian law ihl emphasizes the principles of proportionality and necessity the argument that a highvalue target justifies significant collateral damage fails to meet these principles the military advantage must significantly outweigh the harm to civilians and every effort must be made to minimize civilian casualties your assertion that different tools are available within israeli territory does not negate the obligation to protect civilians if you argue that bombing a humanitarian camp is justified due to military necessity then by the same logic an attack on an israeli civilian area with a highvalue target would also be justified which is clearly unacceptable this double standard exposes the inherent bias in your argument mohammad deif or whoever the f you iof and i dont care its not the first massacre and excuse that has been used literally every week theres a new massacre at a school hospital refugee camps etc i must remind you that unfortunately for you everything that is happening there is broadcasted live blaming hamas for hiding among civilians does not absolve the attacking force from its responsibility to protect civilian lives using civilian presence as a shield is a violation of ihl by hamas but responding with disproportionate force also violates ihl and undermines the moral high ground if you genuinely believe all lives are precious you must advocate for adherence to international law uniformly regardless of nationality justifying civilian casualties on one side while condemning them on the other is morally inconsistent and legally indefensible,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSmVWd09hLWlfLTBodWI3UG9IYzJseXZIS0RTVkJMMmw0c0RKb3BBY0Y5VzhESi1PUUI4aGd4LVFMaEw3bURaZGVlaEJsWWcyUnhFWUlDcWt1eExsNHc9PQ==

some western military analysts somehow defend israels actions but from human rights organizations and un organizations its universal condemnation netanyahus preferred icc appointee is seeking his arrest warrant for crying out loud i am surprised how cynical places like west point and the cofr are defending a regime that is bombing refugee camps every single day and killing dozens of civilians at a time but then again russias military scholars defend putins invasion and how theyre being supposedly noble and righteous when bombing ukrainian infrastructure also chinas military academics talk about the supposed need to invade taiwan for all these disingenuous purposes before october th i thought western military institutions had a little bit more credibility but thats definitely not the case however for as sleezy as they are i still havent come across a non israeli military analyst who thinks that militarily defeating hamas is even possible its amazing that john spencer is employed by west point yet gets so much wrong i remember being taken aback by that when i listened to his sam harris podcast israel has taken precautionary measures even the united states did not do during its recent wars in iraq and afghanistan but they also use <number> pound bombs in tightly packed civilian areas and the us doesnt use bombs larger than <number> pounds in such <url> so theyve sent out more ineffectual leaflets and text messages than the us did which give unclear directions and whose evacuation paths the idf often bombs but the bombs they use in civilian areas are <number> times as large and the us has an atrocious human rights record yet even with that as the measuring stick israel still fails horribly he also says that the civilian casualty rate is comparatively low in gaza thats just straight up incorrect even in the chief what about example used to divert from the israels crimes yemen about <number> children were killed from direct conflict in about a decade <url> while in gaza the number has already surpassed <number> in less than a year <url> i am surprised how thoughtful the responses i get are from people i think are defending a regime that is so obviously monstrous just look at the news every day in my opinion israels regime has proven beyond any reasonable doubt that they simply want to collectively punish gazas population for the hamass terrorist october th put that aside though simply follow the news and ask yourself this if the idf thinks hamas fighters are nearby is it okay to drop a bomb which rhetoric know will kill dozens of children in order to possibly take out those hamas fighters anybody who responds to me has to first answer the above question i will not answer any responses if you do not first answer my question above,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhS2lJbmxpOW9rSkRNUkpjNkFxUTV2Y3dtXzRJYUNhdktaVWFPNF9tc3ZlUFBlYXNNREFaQ2lqOG9aYlpRNnZTcWduSHRqSGJmcng2ZkpnbTV0QlNOSjZqN0dTSkFVcExlaXpfV2l2NjkwNnc9
the bottom line is participation was not just militants but ordinary gazans how many <number> ordinary folks <number> is that enough for you to condemn <number> million people there is huge support for hamas before and after the pogrom hamas was not all that popular before the war the arab barometer a research network where we serve as coprincipal investigators conducted a survey in gaza and the west bank days before theisraelhamas warbroke out the findings reveal that rather than supporting hamas the vast majority of gazans have been frustrated with the armed groups ineffective governance as they endure extreme economic hardship most gazans do not align themselves with hamass ideology either unlike hamas whose goal is to destroy the israeli state the majority of survey respondents favored a twostate solution with an independent palestine and israel existing side by side <url> also hamas only rose to win the elections because of israels pull out of gaza they should not have left gaza like they did leaving unilaterally made it look like that hamass strategy of militancy was viable if they had left after negotiations with the pa it would look like negotiation is the way to get things done leaving as they did was catastrophic and remarkably stupid but it was also cynical the leaders of israel at the time were clear in their words that the pullout of gaza was done to buy <number> years for israel to not make peace in october <number> prime minister ariel sharons senior adviser dov weisglass saidthe significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process and when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of a palestinian state and you prevent a discussion on the refugees the borders and jerusalem effectively this whole package called the palestinian state with all that it entails has been removed indefinitely from our agenda and all this with authority and permission all with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of congress that is exactly what happened you know the term peace process is a bundle of concepts and commitments the peace process is the establishment of a palestinian state with all the security risks that entails the peace process is the evacuation of settlements its the return of refugees its the partition of jerusalem and all that has now been frozen what i effectively agreed to with the americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all and the rest will not be dealt with until the palestinians turn into finns that is the significance of what we did sharons deputy leader and future israeli pm ehud olmert saidwe may have to espouse unilateral separation it would inevitably preclude a dialogue with the palestinians for at least <number> years the perception among palestinians is that hamas is the only group willing to do anything thats why they are popular when they actually do something the sooner the west realizes this the better why what would happen,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTFB3d2VGbTlBZ1A0MDg5Z09UMzJiTEJ2QndkRzlhMWxDQjhPMHp2clRGcDlXc0NhUlpSRDlHMExNSHlkdnRWUzltSnVrVEZxYWxqVTVRdURzSGhjbGc9PQ==

> it was a simple yes or no question so sorry to deny you your gotcha moment but alas the real world is frequently more complicated than yes or no > your argument fundamentally relies on a double standard that is not morally or legally defensible under international law lets see > if all lives are indeed precious then the principle must be applied uniformly while the principle must be applied uniformly it is a fact of life that precious doesnt mean having the same value what is precious for me may be worthless for you and vice versa if you were right then in every negotiation up to now hamas should stand firm upon a <number><number> trade ratio and yet they demanded <number> of their soldiers for a single israeli soldier apparently precious is subjective to hamas furthermore it is simple human nature that keeping kin alive is more important than keeping the lives of those who attack kin > the nationality of the civilians does not change the ethical or legal calculus you couldnt be more wrong or there would never have been one single instance of this thing called war and yet there has been numerous if your point stands then there should be no borders no nationalities nothing and yet check notes there are > international humanitarian law ihl emphasizes the principles of proportionality and necessity agreed > the argument that a highvalue target justifies significant collateral damage fails to meet these principles hardly the contrary is quite the case > the military advantage must significantly outweigh the harm to civilians and every effort must be made to minimize civilian casualties the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki are not considered war crimes why because they led japan to decide not to further pursue war which would have led the allies to invade the home islands with the associated loss of life that would be significantly bigger than the two atom bombs likewise israel went after two military leaders and their associated retinue both had been responsible for the ongoing commanding of the war from hamas side if you every heard the term decapitation as a strategy it is quite well regarded as a conflict shortener as it tends to throw the enemy into disarray at this time anything that shortens the war is not only justified but also of the interest of the gazans if not their leadership > your assertion that different tools are available within israeli territory does not negate the obligation to protect civilians no it does not but it cuts short the array of means israel has at its disposal to pursue the war since we have already established that the purpose of the war from the israeli side is to protect israelis from hamas that takes precedence over the collateral damage inflicted due to the decision by hamas leadership to put themselves in the middle of a humanitarian zone given the means the motive and the opportunity versus the military gain of decapitating the opposite force the powers that be in the idf and the government of israel decided it was a valid military operation and moved forward you are not equipped to or requested of to make a different evaluation > if you argue that bombing a humanitarian camp is justified due to military necessity no the bombing of a military target is justified by military necessity the target having chosen to embed itself in a humanitarian camp removed the protections of said camp given to it by the laws of war it is quite clear to anyone who understands the realities of war > by the same logic an attack on an israeli civilian area with a highvalue target would also be justified agreed a pinpoint attack with the correct means to minimize collateral damage at an israeli strategic target embedded into the israeli civilian population would be justified by the laws of war but hamas doesnt do pinpoint attacks they do carpet rocketing so we may never know > this double standard exposes the inherent bias in your argument there is no double standard in both cases an attack would be justified > blaming hamas for hiding among civilians does not absolve the attacking force from its responsibility to protect civilian lives no it does not it only brings out the reality of how israel choses the correct tool for the correct occasion for example rather than <number> hamas soldiers and civilians that died with their commander it could have been <number> if israel adopted the russian approach of scorched earth israel would not be wondering if deif is dead or not because there would havent been a stone left unturned in that area instead as the pictures clearly show you know everything is broadcast now it is easy to see it was a very limited attack and that is israel exercising its responsibility to protect civilian lives > mohammad deif or whoever the f you iof and i dont care good for you not practical or even logical but hey you do you > if you genuinely believe all lives are precious you must advocate for adherence to international law uniformly regardless of nationality and i do thats why i demand from my government to take to task those found operating against the guidelines and why i expect the world to go after

ok so armenians and syriacs a long with other groups found refuge in palestine they became part of palestinian society why do you think the zionist movement was the outlier its because the goal was to colonize and replace the natives not as complicated as you make it seem a large chunk of the palestinians are descendants of jews and samaritans who converted to christianity and islam the jewish presence is irrelevant you can colonize a country because there is very small percentage of people who practice a religion similar to yours you have to remember the zionist came to palestine not the other way around,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQkl0b3NDaTZGWWFPUjF3T2xXaVBBUkhLbDl4enNwT21IUDZCRE1odmozc2dERWVOb3h6S0Z3Z2NiZFhtYVNoMURpNFBhOVhVZnEzaUl6RGoxU215aFUyd3NzMWp4NzNaV3JFZVZyV1VSN3c9

in order to accept the premise of this question you have to accept that all the people who are intent on returning back to their ancestral homelands or intent on living with freedom in their homeland are terrorists the parallels between wwii axis powers have multiple incongruences both japan and germany to this day are largely mono cultural especially japan had the allies decided to colonise japan and force them to be second class citizens then im in no doubt there would still be kamikazes and katanas flying the brutality of the french in algeria and the white south africans did not meet their objectives because colonialism is unsustainable as a permanent solution without complete eradication of the native population see australia the reason this argument is pretty much airtight is simple because it has been proven to be true over and over again for over <number> years with every conflagration israel gets bigger and the result of this geographic aggression is more displacement and disaffection people will never accept this disenfranchisement and human nature is to fight oppression and occupation there are terrorism and terrorist acts which are horrific by nature and design but until the root cause of this is honestly examined and an equitable solution offered it will not stop the suggestion to hiroshima palestinians is exactly what it is sounds like and the dresdening of gaza has happened israels miscalculation is that this devastation will be preventative that much is plain to see,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneXdYbG42WWY0Q1J2Q01PM0lMelRBWmxONmRTbE85dWo1b0RCWGxZaDhRVWxJQUZQNUtlYm5fWl9GZEl5c3BkT2VtSDdxbGh1a09oLTZPWjdUMzBNTTEtSFc4Ti1yVE40YUZSTXEyRnc3dm89

i want to preface my argument by saying that i dont believe there is an ethnic cleansing in israel at least not to the degree that some people are arguing but your argument doesnt really hold water if a country decides to pick an ethnicity and kill everyone in that ethnicity except those whos name starts with a w you wouldnt argue that it isnt an ethnic cleansing israel choosing to not kill israeli arabs does not mean anything beside that they chose not to kill a subset of the palestinian based on a criteria that they chose,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnb2haQWhaZXFVclRmcmg5WUlmalU4eFV4dkxlVzlLYjN4Ql9FVE1yWVU2LXZQNnEtODR5RTFaSnJ0MEhrQm51ZmpZd3Zhd1FRV2I1X0d4X2dhUHlYOU5pZUJhMHpkcUcxY1ZKaXg4eFpQd289
>its not pointless jews have been the victims of ethnic cleansing so its really disgusting when hateful people spin it around and say jews perpetrate ethnic cleansing this doesnt really make sense theres nothing about a particular ethnicity suffering in a particular way that then prevents people of that ethnicity inflicting the same type of suffering in future jewish people were forced out of numerous countries and jewish communities also fled from some without being specifically forced out but because they had good reason to fear for their safety this was ethnic cleansing in both cases the founders of israel perpetrated ethnic cleansing during the nakba >and <number> of israelis are arab so there is not ethnic cleansing common misconception neither ethnic cleansing nor genocide have to be total to meet the commonly accepted definitions they have to be a concerted effort to kill or expel people based on ethnicity and israel did make a concerted effort to expel people based on ethnicity during the <number> war refugees fleeing in war is common and wouldnt count as ethnic cleansing on its own of course but those refugees having legitimate reason to fear for their safety because of the advancing armies destroying arab villages and in some cases committing massacres and later being prevented from returning based on their ethnicity does make it ethnic cleansing,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRVMzU21kS2VHOHRGNlV0cWl0SnpoVEhiUmFYWVVNaU5LOU5lMmtsX0k2TUFMRHhsYmxPT25DZ0wyeUlhcGhkNkhpcU1hZ1lLTHpLNlZnWUxpc3hueFQ0azBDUUdlMUw0WVZfYWQtQi1VT1U9

a large portion of the arabs that left israel left at the command of arab military leaders who ensured them they would be able to return soon after the jews were defeated that didnt play out all that well for them many also left because of exaggerated fear propaganda made by the arabs displayed in print and played on radio they took real events like deir yassin invented things that didnt happen lied about the numbers of dead and injured and otherwise exaggerated the events when arabs fled as a result of this that certainly wasnt israel doing ethnic cleansing my understanding is that deir yassin massacre happened because the arabs in that city had broken their peace agreement with the jews but ive only heard that second hand from someone who allegedly had it from a book by historian benny morris some people were driven out by violence or by the jews capitalizing on the unfounded fear created by the arab propaganda but my understanding is that its unlikely thats true for even half of those who left israel during that period of history,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndTJDUGhBbEJkRWVQeGkwV2xYRkF4TWZDdW94M0lDSWo1dkp5ZE4yQzlkaW4xVWVBRU9aVzl1RzV3SWl4cUxPZjlIRDZ0NDVmcjIzX1VvUVZxODJkZEV6Z2hxS0dQRlRZV1YxeE92bkpJTXc9

being able to look away and ignore death and destruction is a major major privilege it is okay to get tired of it because you cant handle the pain and misery every day but at the same time the fact that you can afford to get tired and look away in itself is a privilege when mainstream media coverage is poor and super biased of course people will run to social media to post real and raw content and show the world what it happening they are asking for help they are telling their stories you can unfollow block do whatever you like but to come online and complain that youre sick of seeing other peoples lived realities because it is a huge privilege you can even just log off from it all but they cant,r/israelpalestine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX2lDVHhEUkRSZjc5TnAxZndfSjB4VkJVZlY3OWJSZmExQjZVcnBkZmhZS21CR09meHdnb2RMSmJPazRrV0Fxams3Y0NOaTBKN0t3ei1UZVBxN3d4Y1JPSG5fdFBxZHYwQzc2aG1uZ3BZWWc9
