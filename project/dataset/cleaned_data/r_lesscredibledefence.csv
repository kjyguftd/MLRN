to continue to treat china as an nme that links to a person that wrote an opinion piece agrees with you you can express your opinion without going and see this other person who stands to benefit from

rest of the world would quickly normalize trade given that this hasnt happened something even more powerful than greed is keeping the world extremely wary well many somethings if you follow china then roughly once a week it does things that make it obvious it cant be trusted from military drills around places they have no business being to sending weapons and weapon parts to places that they no business sending to to overlooking obvious smuggling to ip theft to unlawful seizure of assets and the list goes on the fact that you can link to a blog written by a trade lawyer that says he thinks that china shouldnt be labelled nme because one interpretation of an agreement can be viewed to suggest that it should no longer be one if you ignore some inconvenient parts of it and pretend that satisfying most conditions is kinda like satisfying all of them after all we decide things on the balance right it wouldnt be right to punish someone for doing most of the things and not doing the one thing they really really didnt want to do right never mind that this one thing they didnt want to do is explicitly the reason from this agreement in the first place > there is no proof of nme or requirement to disprove nme only china is uniquely discriminated in this way and china rightfully objected in the wto ah yes poor china the world just wont let it dump the result of intense government sponsored manufacturing onto the world market without charging them more tarrifs obviously the only victim here is china if only the rest of the world would stop trying to keep its own manufacturing and rely entirely on china its so unfair that the worlds biggest nme is treated as an nme it would be so much more fair if it wasnt treated that way but could remain that way buddy lol > instead of fighting it in court though us decided to kill the court entirely yep we already agree that the us sucks and also needs to be brought down a peg fortunately the us is falling apart on its own and yet there still doesnt seem to be much appetite outside of china to remove the label almost like words mean something and > except in the wto and all the other times china abided by the rules and when praytell was that i guess absolutely always with no exceptions obviously according to you yet for some reason most of the rest of the world keeps treating it like its constantly trying to skirt the rules and attempting to play the you said this therefore you must do it play i wonder if we could find a comparison for other countries in similar positions which went differently ah right the real china seems taiwan isnt having any trouble with handling any of these issues almost like if chinese people actually try to be part of the world community instead of trying to constantly find every humanly possible way to maximize the control of the party at the expense of all else the world might treat it differently or hell why even go that far how about literally every single chinese person living outside of china you know the hard working dedicated persevering people that do really really well when removed from a communist environment the same ones that turn around treat china more strictly than basically any nonasian person > china hasnt followed the rules at all delusional bootlick ignores all contrary evidence and insists on his false reality the guy that literally cant take

ah yes countries have the right to start massive wars at will because its the truth of how the world works how very profound and thoughtful i really wasnt aware that powerful countries have started wars before so thank you for highlighting that by the way does this logic apply to people committing crimes like murder just because they can if i stated that people do not have the right to murder each other would you argue that people do have the right to murder each other based on the same reasoning you use here to justify the right to start wars i mean hey wars and murder both violate laws and both come with severe consequences just like how you point out that powerful countries have the ability to start wars for their own interests people often have the ability to murder other people for their own interest just like how you point out that wars happen and its just the way the world works murder sometimes happens too ajd thats just the way the world works right the same logic you use to defend the right to start wars applies to murder as well so can you reconcile this obviously my point here is that you arguing that any countries have the right to start massive wars simply because they have the ability to is about as thoughtprovoking as someone arguing that they have the right to commit crime because they have the ability to do so if someone was on trial for committing a crime and made this same argument youre making to defend war they might be sparred jail time and sent to a psychiatric ward instead because that is insane nonsense rights are not simply determined by ability when i say people dont have the right to murder each other im not questioning whether they have the ability to do that or if murder happens sometimes similarly when i say a country doesnt have the right to start a war im not questioning their ability to start a war or whether wars happen sometimes so you simply pointing out these countries histories and ability to start wars is nonresponsive to my point and you should do better nobody has the right to murder and no country has some right to start a war and potentially kill millions its insane to suggest otherwise also im just curious does this mean you speak up for usfilipinojapanese etc rights whenever china complains of antagonization in the scs or are you selective,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSWNyM2F3X0tHZnFVWW5pTjZKWGlGYjFKdXBxT2EyemliZ2dWajkzRUFYRXFuZnJEUzdlU1VkcW9YSE9OWUR6aDJhZEFOUEFuMTRZS090dGVSbENWVHc9PQ==

to wage a war rights ability and willingness are all indispensable these three are different what most countries lack is not rights but ability not just the ability to start a war but the ability to end it currently the only country that possesses all three is the united states which has participated in the most wars china obviously lacks the will because we have not fought a war in more than <number> years this is also where westerners especially like to laugh at us thinking that china is a paper tiger with no war experience it has been so long that some people have forgotten that we have the right and ability to go to war and are trying to dictate chinas internal affairs dont simply compare war with criminal crimes such as murder and robbery because criminal crimes have violent institutions that can punish criminals such as the police courts prisons etc but war is different there is no violent institution that can punish a country there is even no institution that can define whether a war is just or not unless authorized by the united nations security council however there are <number> exceptions in the security council and <number> of them have already destroyed this mechanism the united states and russia this is the political reality if you are keen on criticizing the injustice of war i have no objection please continue but i dont think that would help avoid war only by recognizing the coldness of reality and the cruelty of war and being in awe can we avoid war and save livesthats what china is doing in the south china sea we are following the wisdom of our ancestors from <number> years ago to be cautious of war and they should feel lucky that a country that is the second most powerful in the world is only complaining finally let me remind you that japan was a defeated country in world war ii and had no right to go to war as for other countries i always defend their right to go to war,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaWw0WmxKb0E2UkwzMnVPRGFhZ3NPd2JEeTZBVzJsUTJGSGk4TU5ESV9tVXdJTjhlWmJMS1dUNHVuVHpzZWVCb1QtRFFXU05pTWJocTFCY213b1ZkOUE9PQ==

thats cool and all but considering the guy you are commenting gets some simple facts very wrong because he is using chinese estimations i am not taking anything he says as a fact and the fact you did means you shouldnt be commenting about this matter >at <number> kn of constant thrust from the kg booster pushing a kg missile the mk booster weighs <number>lbs kgs<url> meaning the aimb itself weighs <number> lbs kgs ie in this calculation the mk somehow weighs kgs more then it actually does and the missile itself weighs kgs less then it actually does this also means they probably gave the mk booster kgs more propellant then the mk actually has fyi this means every single calculation is wrong ie the booster time is off the amount of propellant it has as well as the amount of thrust it produces is all wrong the figures he is using are estimation coming from a chinese report called the parameter estimation and analysis of standard<number> missile meaning the guy you are quoting to is basing what he is stating off of a chinese report that simply estimated these figures however as i have already noted everything they have given is way off thus these figures cannot be trusted and neither can this calculation next >just did some simplified calculations no air resistance and assuming the sm w booster is launched straight up + but without knowing the trajectory or force of drag from air i cant say for certain even though i have shown that everything he calculates is irrelevant because the figures are wrong it further becomes irrelevant because the whole point of launching from a high altitude is to get away from the issues caused by the force of drag on said missile the fact he cannot include this in his calculation doesnt actually help you case there is also the fact the sm<number> is not launched straight up but whatever so no you should go somewhere else and stop commenting on this as you have no clue what you are talking about which i figured was the case because you have to rely on others to do your work for you,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRFpONFpDS0xtT18zLV93QWcxeGREN3llLVZxX2NzcnFpQVpnbmwyeHVIazdaZjVGcEVtWDgwT2ZWQ1kzcVJKZnBCVlU0eHBhM20xWGxCZzV1XzFrYnc9PQ==

this isnt true the golden urn was a qing institution not a chinese one it was given legitimacy by the tibetans it was also only used less than half the time it was supposed to tibetans never gave legitimacy for the chinese to continue it hence why tibetans chose the dalai lama and panchen lama without chinas input there really arent any historical ties between china and tibet the greatest influence china had on tibet was introducing tea alton khan wasnt under suzerainty of the ming to try and imply that china had anything to do with the dalai lama title or position is absurd at best from forging the golden urn oidtman explains the reforms of <number> were as much about centralizing the authority of the ganden podrang governmentand the geluk church within that governmentthan about asserting imperial decisionmaking authority p he goes on to write according to wei yuan the golden urn was emblematic of the unprecedented expansion of china in equating the great qing state with china in this way wei yuan presaged the elisions of modern chinese nationalists and the historians of the prc who have similarly refined the golden urn as a symbol of chinese sovereignty yet neither the qinglong emperor nor contemporaneous tibetan chroniclers saw it in such terms on the contrary it was a symbol of the qing imperial houses vested interest in promoting the geluk teachingsthe golden urn was a uniquely qing ritual whose animating principles could not outlive the qing state p in <number> the roc issued the law of the method of the reincarnation of lamas which for all intents just changed the name of the qing institutions to those of the roc institutions and that all lamas were to be reincarnated using this method and no new lineages were to be established p no lama was identified under this law the first case of reincarnation under the prc was the fifth jamyang zhepa which the golden urn was used previously for prc officials didnt insist on the golden urn to be used p furthemore the prc didnt sanction nor obstruct the searches for reincarnations and official publications made little mention of the golden urn but why does china care now as oidtman writes the geluk church is an obstacle to the assimilation of the tibetans a bridgehead for tibetan nationalism and the potential foundation of an independent tibetan state p <number> it wasnt until the tenth panchen lama died in <number> that the prc wanted to use the golden urn due to the upheaval in tibet at the time the prc felt their control over tibet was an issue p <number> when the dalai lama announced the new eleventh panchen lama the prc decided to use the golden urn to limit the dalai lamas power china is trying to use the golden urn to control tibet but as sperling writes they china is ignoring a crucial basis for the use of the golden urn acceptance of the ruler as an animation of manjughosa manjusri <url>,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWWlIeVRCZnV6MU5BR3Fsb0xob1dOZXV0Ylh1NmRUeFZUVk5CMTlOeHBYSjFWYUhzWUM1aFliNlJFbzJNUVp2TUpDX0x5UU9oNWxaWTZVMnREVmNZZ0E9PQ==

there are several hurdles to using offtheshelf consumer drones in sensitive areas consumer drones must literally broadcast their users location in real time faa remote id law so anyone like law enforcement with the ground station will be able to see where you your controllers gps location and your drone are in realtime even without this law and the station consumer drones operate in the socalled ism band that is a fixed set of bands in a fixed set of frequencies anyone with frequency meter can see these transmissions tofrom the controller the user and the drone they tend to be low power and easy to jam so there are real hurdles to using consumer drones if you venture outside of the consumer drone space and are willing and able to build and program your own drone then theres probably not too much the authorities can do in the moment but they can and will do something after with custom programming you can use any other suitable frequency bands however powerful you want frequency hoppingspread spectrum such a drone would probably be both difficult to detect in time and difficult to counteract using jamming for anyone doubting these are quite mature technologies but you will <number> be hunted down and brought to justice and people with the technical knowledge and ability are almost without exception not criminally insane with the clear exception of the unabomber i watch videos of lock picking and see that most homes would be very easy to pick the lock off yet essentially no burglaries are based on picking locks similar logic people who can do it wont because theyre not stupid,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacU5BQmVFZGhObjI1TUhTMG1qZ3g3LXo2NGNyNC1PWU05Y3l1bFdsc0M4M1dUbGVqOFRSdlIzMF9zN1RIb2R1V2NHaHZ1MFZONkNnbmhjUVhRVXZQR0E9PQ==
ethnostates are historically much more stable and united this is objective fact not us propaganda social psychology has shown that people tend to work better with those who they identify with and that is why multiculturalism as practiced in liberalism is typically a failure in the longterm whether that identification needs to be genetic or not is still up for debate but culturally there is no dispute it doesnt matter how a state sees itself what matters is whether its policies can successfully create a common cultural identity with which all constituents can identify that is why i wish the ccp the best of luck because in china as in the us and as else where the struggles with multiculturalism have been material there is indeed presently a shift away from it in academic policy recommendations even in the west which im not sure if chinese policy makers are aware,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTXlRakJxREhMN3BuNVlGREdIRGRpTDFLbE1rOWVuYmJGMThSMEM3UGN5OTY3XzhQdDJZbHBRMTVQWVd3V3ctNUY5TVZYMzRWSWt2TW9YTjItSE9pcWc9PQ==

i very carefully excerpted a paragraph that directly addressed your knuckleheaded nonsense you linked a page about a broad research program that in parts explicitly disagrees with your own gibberish > william t rowe wrote that the name china zhongguo or zhonghua was apparently understood to refer to the political realm of the han chinese during the ming dynasty and this understanding persisted among the han chinese into the early qing dynasty and the understanding was also shared by aisin gioro rulers before the mingqing transition the qing however came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the great qing but also nearly interchangeably as china within a few decades of this development instead of the earlier ming idea of an ethnic han chinese state this new qing china was a selfconsciously multiethnic state han chinese scholars had some time to adapt this but by the th century the notion of china as a multinational state with new significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for han chinese writers rowe noted that these were the origins of the china we know today he added that while the early qing rulers viewed themselves as multihatted emperors who ruled several nationalities separately but simultaneously by the midth century the qing empire had become part of a europeanstyle community of sovereign states and entered into a series of treaties with the west and such treaties and documents consistently referred to qing rulers as the emperor of china and his administration as the government of china<number> > joseph w esherick observes that while the qing emperors governed frontier nonhan areas in a different separate system under the lifan yuan and kept them separate from han areas and administration it was the manchu qing emperors who expanded the definition of zhongguo and made it flexible by using that term to refer to the entire empire<number> similarly elena barabantseva has also noted that the manchu referred to all subjects of the qing empire regardless of ethnicity as chinese and they used the term zhongguo as a synonym for the entire qing empire but used hanren to refer only to the core area of the empire with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic<number> so um thanks for proving yourself wrong i dont know if its very helpful per se but it really goes to show,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaakRmVlpyTW1xcXJzY19EclYxcENxY2JMSEZzUFFwR0VabE9raHZYTjJEM1VwTnpncTlNVTE3UzM0RFF0eDVaY3J0ZEhjazFPLUQ4RTRralhaVUFaWG4yb3VpbFhST3F0Z1NHTEEtYWNhaE09

the funny part is nato allies in other words us officials are letting out some baseless rumor out in order to make chinese investors wary and prevent further investments in europe thus preventing a further intertwining between the european and chinese economies and also damaging the european economy even more in the process which means europe will become more dependent of the us if the rumors of seizing the russian reserves had such a devastating dedolarization effect around the world imagine rumors like these the gulf countries are going become wary the chinese are going to become wary and any country in the global south will become wary which means massive amounts of capitals will stop flowing into europe let alone the fact that china has much more western assets to reclaim in china if they wanted the shangai tesla gigafactory alone is probably worth more than all that infrastructure combined,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUHJBU0N2U3VxaWZ6YWNyTVJFb2JpekU2ckRYNmkxNFhEZlRtNkFZancxMlNFMG1DRTVzcFRianphRmtDZzRJenlDUFNzWWdiWmxlZWFka2R6YzdtV1E9PQ==

theres plenty of ways soft power is much more important than hard power and like i said both ussr and china have feared those aspects of it look up peaceful evolution theory or perhaps wang hunings america against america those chapters where he analyzes how ideology and socialcultural values can end up having the biggest geopolitical impact also consider his position within the ccp and how china has been orienting the last ~years for ussrrussia you can look up george kennans long telegram address where he talks about what the best way would be to defeat ussr its still relevant to this day great powers rarely fight each other directly theyll usually be nicer about it first then pursue proxy wars and only in the end use hard power but in the modern age soft power has become much more important because informational warfare is way easier to utilize during the cold war in the domain of hard power ussr was very powerful and while id never argue they could directly match usa id say that in the military domain they were closest to that economically diplomatically sociallyculturally they had major issues usa waged plenty of proxywars in the cold war and saw very little apparent success from using its hard power what won the cold war was soft power warsaw pact was kept together not by soft power but by hard power and the moment ussr flinched it all collapsed usa on the other hand never needed to have such a fear over its own spheres of influence because they utilized soft power instead its much easier running an empire where your subjects willingly follow you along compared to one where you have to force them to,r/lesscredibledefence,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbl9MLTBaOTdESFlsbjB6c0VNRXk5YjBhYTVjTmVhWUc3NlktMmJoSU8tVzZvZ0hvamdOWDdWZ096amFjOXBEYUxHVkJEVTlrcjhWOXhtSTB4aHk3Rmc9PQ==
