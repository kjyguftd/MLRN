hi i have a tabular dataset of which some are labelled and a large portion is unlabelled im trying to minimize the logloss on the unlabelled data so overfitting on it would be perfectly fine what would be the best approach i tried pseudolabels predicting the unlabelled data and adding the most confident samples to the training data but it made almost no difference on the test loss plus i know the results as the overall logloss value of a couple of predictions on this unlabelled dataset any way to utilize that,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMXNFZGxyZUxuWE5zVGh0ZkdKOUR1UTVxU1RzczJ6aEV3eXVXZFVzTEJsNG05djhXOVB0eW5zRW10S1ZBallPLVBmM29BWHZUQzlFU3NXZExwLTAyMmc9PQ==

im an engineer on a team working on an llmbased support chatbot at my company in my opinion these types of tools are very important building around llms presents a lot of challenges that i havent encountered before in other types of development the universe of inputsoutputs from an llm is so broad that it is hard to effectively eval it independent of live interactions sure you can and should build up some eval datasets that you can run automated evals against but they will barely scratch the surface of the range of inputsoutputs you will actually encounter so your best quality signal will come from realtime monitoring of customer interactions i cant speak to the usefulness or quality of any particular tool though since my company is notorious for their not built here mentality so weve mostly built these systems out from scratch,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYnhqRVdoTm9NUk9WbnVrT2ptVUZhSjFWNC1Dakt2TVlpNEQzSnY4d0Z2TkZEVm84bW9teG1mZ2ZvUURVZXJqaVp0cGJIMHpuczFBNHZORUFscDJWZDA5d0ZHWVdPbUJCekdoRzZZNy14RUE9
im not sure what you mean the theory of the null hypothesis is the same regardless of your statistical test the point is for it to be rejected not necessarily for it to be accepted typically we would say that either we rejected the null or we failed to reject the null but you are right that the null hypothesis depends on what you are testing sometimes the null hypothesis is that your distribution is gaussian or that there is no difference in means between two populations etc edit to clarify i think i see what you were trying to say but my comment was in regards to the specific null hypothesis that was asked about in this thread and its about the null hypothesis in general,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaEpmS1Fmbl9WNF9ONDlUc0c3aU9NS1phOUpPZ0VhVjRZbGNqSUxQV09hYlZaV0FRWURpSTNtQ0JzM3dhcnhvbFBqWjVURkZMVnNhTk5CR3k3b1E5alE9PQ==

there are different types of machine learning for most of it you wont need such a high spec machine most of it involves building predictive models on small datasets of just a few thousand rows this is especially true when youre learning so you dont need a particularly good laptop to do that i had a macbook air with an intel chip and gb of ram and it got me through almost every exercise and hackathon i did while studying a masters of data science however there will be times where you need something much more powerful for example when you want to fine tune an llm or chain several of them together to do something crazy like build a model that converts signlanguage to text in real time when you do those sorts of projects a macbook m pro with gb wont be enough at that point youll need to use a cloud computing service from a company like aws or microsoft or google cloud but thats good when you get into the job market one of the questions people will ask you is what experience do you have with cloud providers it will be good if you can point to projects youve built using them and all you need to run cloud services is any old laptop with a browser as all the actual computation will be done using the providers computer and because of that id say your most important priority when looking for a laptop is that it has a nice big screen a good keyboard and isnt very heavy that way youll have plenty of screen real estate to watch training videos with a bit of room for your ide on the side when you need a high spec computer use cloud services when you dont which will be most of the time the specs you get wont matter pro tip <number> look around for the github student pack it gives heavy discounts and free trials on a whole range of software online courses cloud services for anyone with a edu email address pro tip <number> re mac vs windows it used to be that mac was the obvious choice for data scientists not just because of the mac build quality but because macs run on linux and so do the cloud providers if you have a mac youre going to use the terminal window and get used to all the linux commands that will be useful as a cloud engineer having said that you can now get a terminal window that runs linux on the windows os as well so if you have to use windows you can,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbXV1eHR4R2VlRGFFMVNEQmxSRThWZk41YjZNVXdaWW9YSHlOeGJrbjhILUdlOTNiZWF5cFNvd1J6U0YzOHVQTTV6eWVIU2tuU1hKQXpvbHRjOW56UEE9PQ==
yeah this idea of rotating data is called data augmentation and its garbage in comparison to actually having a network that has invariant or equivariant learnable features the research on symmetry problems in ml is already quite mature btw just because a model is invariant doesnt mean its good you can construct invariant models by only using distances between points but then you cant differentiate <number>body symmetries the sota models have <number><number> body learnable representations built into them also not saying that any of this might be important for your specific problem since it seems youre doing inverse design but i think its interesting for you to learn about since it could be helpful,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUDI3VktqaGlzaV9adkxCMWl3Q1hxNDRfMXJNRWgtZkllRi11WjROUEtYOVhUaUF0RW1BQXVhbUFCUVlzREJIRVVyZkhWUE5PZVJxdjBHQV8wOERDOFE9PQ==

yes but the bigger reason is usage you build a bot that plays a game then its use is mostly to be a powerful player capable of sustaining exploits and strong adversaries its main use case is being tested for its weakest capabilities you build a chat bot that answers questions then its use is to be generally helpful in questions that people need help with sure there will be exploits but who cares i dont use chatgpt to make it say inappropriate stuff and most people dont use it in an adversarial way its main use case is in its strongest capabilities completely different problem statements,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSTA5azFLR3RmNGhjTkQ5NEZDQkhoU0lSRHp6SkYxMFRTUHVGekdMaGNycjR5ZkpXYllyVHB6aFJ4ZkJhZkFsdkQzNm5JWlRzSlczdVFNYXpuWlBLQnc9PQ==

hard to give a single answer but > especially when it comes to prompt injection adversarial attacks profanity offtopic content one can homebake some quick functions such as regex on the less smart and embeddings comparison for the smarter side yes you can homebake but if you are a business of meaningful scale you probably really want the best or at least something close to it eg an airlines company really doesnt want their bot spouting racist nonsense that will end up on twitter of course the price has to be right but the market is fairly competitive to be clear this is not to say that everyone does this but it is an example of where strong market impetus can come from now in practice the flip side is that the base behavior for eg oai is actually quite good at least for trying to make sure you dont venture into nsfw so for this specific example nsfw tooling the longterm standalone market may not be huge > or perhaps these tools target larger businesses <number>+ employees who would rather focus on their core expertise and offload all of this externally like they do with grafanaprometheusdatadog etc or even startupsif youre a startup you also should be focusing on your core expertise and offloading externally everything that you can in practice of course the reason that you often dont is <number> a lot of these offerings have high minimum spend <number> it can be harder for you to absorb integration risk and <number> youre more likely to be able to absorb the twitter post risk,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTODlwc1hvdmpTN3JjakNhWjRVMkhDVGttcnhPNzlqQzZfVnFYWGZiNmJFNVdTN0tjS1VDSk9jWnduT3d0Y3ZTWGgtVFY0dUlETXFGdzFNa3RzTmdOeVE9PQ==
oh nice so are you implying that someone needs to have a whitepaper for them to have done research that is complete nonsense i love it they have released a technical report talking about how things work of course they are not releasing every nook and cranny but just because something is not open source does not mean theyre not doing research also they put the tool in the hands of many different artistsfilmmakers that have been making things with it for example air head by shy guys some of these people have been on podcasts talking in depth about their usage of the tool i guess these guys are just lying out their ass right,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNUNnd1hxVHFIWExRMzhuWFJQOTNmMmotREotb25weGI5Q19ISW5zYThyLUVLMEcyQjVkZ0NObnh6b0NnQUVhb2ZCQmEwSEZwWkVvTEZMVDU3T21TeWc9PQ==

this discussion was actually a great exercise to repeat some formerly learned content since i had to google up again what you might mean i just wanted to add that the null hypothesis for shapirowilk in case it can not be rejected actually says that the data is normal distributed if it is rejected it may be some other however if the null hypothesis can not be rejected you still might have the second order error or betaerror which you can not quantify it basically says that if your null hypothesis can not be rejected there is still some posaibility that the data you are testing does not behave according to your null hypothesis to some degree of error therefore you rather want to reject the null hypothesis as you can define beforehand with alpha which degree of error you are going to accept i think thats the most important takeaway,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNy1wM0w4SnloY3lFQ0NBaEM1cVRiVXVvdnpNcVJBUkNaSnQ1SEZyNkRZcEFLQnFzYjZndF9ybE9NcExrQUdBM285S0RSTW1yT0YtMGNPR1BlN3M3QU14aXRnQlZMOHZpV0ZPekNPRXk4Vk09

one of the papers cited by alpahfold for their modeling choices is this one <url> that link goes to an earlier version of generating molecular conformer fields which unlike the more recent version says the following > instead of using graph neural networks with intricate equivariance designs mcf builds a score network using perceiverio jaegle et al <number> see fig <number> which is a scalable and efficient variant of the transformer architecture our model is simple to implement and efficient to scale experiments on recent conformer generation benchmarks show mcf surpasses strong baselines by a gap that gets larger as we scale model capacity basically they deliberately avoid using equivariance in order to simplify their model and they compensate for this by making their model really big alphafold is based on the same logic but they dont explicitly mention that they dont need equivariance because they use a larger scale model if you want to do single gpu training then it might be necessary to bake a lot more symmetries into the model which might make the model design subtle or complicated cc uexarctus,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMm82SHhVT0M3aGIwM2dydjFVWWhQOXFHWEpEeWlSTDhEVjJUcU5XTkdrUi1IakUydjJ3RFdBZ01rTmp1YU5aX21rOUcyQjBOQXlSQmFOSk9vZWlKZ3c9PQ==

actually testing for normality is useless in practice really there are only two options the test will tell you that the dataset is not normal since nothing in the real world is truely normally distributed the test will tell you i have too low of a pvalue to confirm or deny that the dataset is normally distributed it is also the wrong question you do not care at all whether you data is normally distributed what you truely care about is is the dataset distributed in a way that i can use a normal distribution as a model notice that for a variable to be modellable with a normal distribution it does not have to be normal it just has to be somewhat close in practice there are plenty of things you can slap a normal distribution on top of and not really loose anything in general you have to distinguish modelling assumptions from tests i recommend the following just plot the empirical cumulative density function on top of the cdf of the normal distribution use cdfs not pdfs comparing pdfs is rarely useful if they look similar enough then you will be fine,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTkNsODUtMHY3MmJwc0owclVvXy1jTDYxc2cwVlFOc3d4bk1FdENJWmtQUVYtTktQUE5pR0dkQnVqS2NlUXh1WU10Q3dqMTE2UHU0dFVYWGtMUFFSV2c9PQ==

yeah i think this statement is misleading computationally equivariant models are actually fairly cheap to evaluate specifically because they do not need to be that big and are very data efficient ive worked a lot in designing cuda implementations for these models and they are best in class in terms of accuracy vs computational cost they are not easy to understand though and it can take some time to be comfortable with them if youre not familiar with group theory,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQTc5c3RpR255QkdWRGxiVVZnRFlBbDJNYmVUeGdnalczWUo5azFZVUpXakxka05WOGNOUE1Vc1M1WkNDYUNpdlRmUnVGN3VZV1JsMVE1MzlPb3czdWc9PQ==

right thats exactly what they mean theyre not trying to save on computation theyre doing the opposite theyre using simpler models and making up for that fact by using bigger parametrizations in order to do more computation theyre literally trying to save on the complexity of the model implementation they say elsewhere in the paper that one of the reasons for this is that using equivariances in this context can require domain specific knowledge according to them its not enough just to make a model generally equivariant to eg translations and rotations you also need to make specific parts of some molecules equivariant to rotations etc,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVndqUlhZT3lWUDR5cEVqTWVad041Z1g1MENpbndXU1QxUDg4OEIyT2JHYTZLYnZoY195Smh3cE5HRi01NVBDbk1TREtYaUp3YXpRZG1rNk5iMk5NVUE9PQ==

yes what you want is that identical atomic environments that are related by a rotationtranslation to have the same representation so you do actually want them to have the same equivariances the way you do this is to represent atomic environments in terms of radial and spherical harmonics expansions and then when you wish to combine these features together eg to increase the bodyorder or to do message passing or to simply make the features more complex you use clebschgordon tensor products to mix them together this operation ensures that the resulting feature is equivariant with respect to e<number> group,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSVc2cy1abk5JRVBPTm9jTXdNcGhObFBfMVdzUTJyWXM2QXRiclZoOWhkeTJCQW9zMFJfMmN3QXUzTWxpSTF4cU5LSUMySlB2V3NZN3FsRWRTQlJFQ3c9PQ==

this is an interesting question that shouldnt be too tough to test out create a dataset from your multimodal vectors with the labels being the modality and then train a mlp to predict modality from vectors i would guess it depends on your specific modeltask and like the other poster mentioned whether you are feeding extra information in to represent modality like sentinel tokens but i would guess that in most cases there should be artifacts in the vector that come from each encoder in a way that a model could use to tell them apart,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN1R1LXp1MVV4S2NTX19KdXkxekVIZXV4dm9HNDhrdUo5cXJnRl9JX3NkeUtnd1NTWEdBTkJlMElkck4yRVo5aDJTLTJyd0hRVzg4a0tOYWFzRDA2ZlE9PQ==

if there is some correlation there is some predictive power now factor in many other variables that have some predictive power then factor in the dynamic interplay between some of these variables that has some predictive power the end result is a system that is not perfect but has some meaningful predictive power that can be measured just like literally every other machine learning model i know its chic to say polygraph tests are useless or pseudoscience but if youve ever taken one youd probably see the utility in being able to identify some percentage of people who lie okay maybe not the sociopaths,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcy1iLTEwQ3E0b3lzVDVrbHFtNnZqV0p4UTg0RFo0S3FucEQyOHlwcElESU1jZ3pVaXpaaXM3LUtraXlTVVMtbkNPNzV6VElqSVNMZEpaMlAyS2ZYdi1rb1VFeDRfeEp6Ulk0Q0xTZTBGQmM9

ai models for medical imaging are in many clinics now however the first step has been to automate the boring stuff eg tumor segmentation which could take a doctor <number> hours but with ai is normally reduced to less than half the time to check and edit while these are being adopted and the effects of adoption are being studied more ambitious models that not only automate work but try to make treatment decisions are being developed it will take a while for things to be implemented but imo we are just scratching the surface in terms of opportunities however as always the majority of discoveries arent immediate gamechangers but just slow incremental progress that builds up over time,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWTdaUEJ0bkFabUdiTWVvaWlLQTN1N1hHU3ZYTGowQ2JDNzR4cWk2QWo5VFJWSWd5RTlDckptQXplaUFGMUR6a3hlS3ZISW1JVDdTTkFhM0hpWVJlYnc9PQ==

im relatively new to ml so i may not be using the term correctly im talking about a datadriven approach where the algorithm learns targets or associations that the scientist wouldnt have thought to look at themselves or are too complex for humans to understand this is opposed to an experimentdriven approach where the scientist systematically uncovers a biological mechanism using a series of targeted experiments it seems like more meaningful advances in medicine come from the latter,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTa1VxX3FmdzJ2XzJQUXBWU0JOZ2RYVHprTkVTNm9sSkwtcmpoY1N3NlUzQkE4QlVMOF8xd2x4YWpWNGwwcWp6RVBfdlVwOTluUkZsalNUTHpNM0VhN184YTBwOEs5OXVfMGdrdFN6MTVvdjg9
i cant really speak to whats going on in biopharma but when it comes to health systems like hospitals and clinics trying to implement and reap value from ml its been underwhelming in my opinion the problems have nothing to do with ml or medicine bureaucracy and red tape at large hospitals is almost as bloated as the government makes things like getting data and securing a budget move at a snails pace also the folks building the systems usually know little about what a clinician does daytoday and that means theyll focus on the wrong problems before realizing where the important gaps are i think the biggest thing that no one has quite figured out is that you need to be so operationally excellent to go from a trained model to having a team of hundreds of clinician using it daily tracking and auditing both the model and the clinicians output continually improving the process until you can confirm you have a working system anyways ive been kneedeep in healthcare ai for some time now so im probably a bit jaded take what i say with a grain of salt heres an article that talks about where ml didnt move the needle when it should have <url><url> heres one where some amazing results have come out of leading hospitals <url><url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeWctM1hQU3RKNTZKSllMZTBYUHl3YURIX1dNZXE1anFmNkFIWE1hTnY2cUdYcW1UYXZGTGRTbEtLMnFPT0p4RVp0NFZ1WFN4M04tTmx5Wjhlb0xHX3c9PQ==

physician here ai is already making inroads to make tedious things less tedious such as automating some aspects of writing clinical documentation which may help physician burnout that will not directly help patients but it makes things more efficient on the backend ai tools are doing some initial reads for radiological images in some places to help the radiologists in terms of ai that will directly help patients weve long already had the technology to do that but due to the culture of medicine it is far underutilized for example we still have a lot of unnecessary misdiagnosis despite learning great diagnostic skills in medical school and beyond and learning about cognitive biases that can affect accurate diagnosis the culture of medicine is still that a doctor should just know everything by memory so if you have to look something up it is because you are inexperienced or a bad doctor but no matter how experienced and wellstudied a physician is mistakes will happen when things are not done systematically see the checklist manifesto by atul gawande for a whole treatise on this as someone who has personally faced misdiagnosis as a patient because of anchoring bias and premature closure i wish my physician had used a clinical decision support system to offer a wide set of possible diagnoses the differential diagnosis as opposed to just jumping on the first diagnosis that seemed halfway consistent with the symptoms so until it becomes culturally acceptable and the norm that doctors utilize technology to help make diagnosis or treatment decisions nothing will change no matter how good the technology gets,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTS2NsZmdWUXltaGhsSUs3X2N3bzk2Q0I3SUhLODNmcE5FNzA0UEMyeGN2SEFRYzFOUHI2ZkF3emFJVzJlSWJDbTA5R3M0dXBxdXBINXVyRGNwSml4X1E9PQ==

the ai systems would likely look nothing like what we have now im not even sure how far down you would use ai assuming just stupid compute actually rather reasonable in the grand scheme them you can go from the atoms up you could literally simulate every interaction for earth assuming no shortcuts and maybe no quantum computing so with the big case out of the way lets talk assumptions do we really need to simulate every interaction  i mean most interactions happen at the boundaries we can likely make a lot of bulk property assumptions do we really need high fidelity simulation everywhere or just near the agents i mean quantum uncertainty is already a thing could they really tell if the air in the middle of no where behaves right do we really need to simulate the sound of a tree falling in the forest better yet we can just simulate one brain and the experiences it has interacting with things use predictive models and lower level agents the socially and physically farther they are away one person will never be able to tell even if they suspect so in short we may not know the means right now yet the math says its possible and rather easily so on the cosmic scale i suspect in this century we would be able to simulate an entire brain and its interactions likely for medical purposes from there the universe is the limit you may now have an existential panic attack,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYVJUcjJiLXBCbDFpYTNyUm91ek1DMXl6M1BabGhPbnFHcTJPV1htX0tZR2c0dkMycWJaazZUZmlWTmdrOWQ5R2V6a2RWbmdqQ2xHdUZvWDZ5bGFjWC1MTVBvRTF6ckRXOVJpUkstc2NpV0U9

in the context of multimodal search you can definitely tell the model the type of each vector by simply concatenating that information you can then adjust your search metric so that similar images and texts remain close to each other by ignoring those concatenated dimensions in your calculation in a generative context you can just use special tokens to indicate where the image starts and ends,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTLW1rR1hiN0o3ZTh4eEhrT09NMWUxNXNNR2FnNVZvTmY2aTkzM1ljMDUyXzhKQlF0UzBhNVpMYUZHTm01eGJoa3FQSlN6bHdtZUFWTE51ZEZRbi03Qmc9PQ==

i think the issue here isnt that ai has no success stories its that in practice theres not going to be a drug thats designed by ai instead there are going to be a bunch of tools that are built using ai and are used in conjunction with other techniques for instance as you mentioned ai is widely used in interpreting medical imagery but its not used to tell patients the results of their tests its used to highlight things that doctors should take a closer looks at similarly machine learning is used in a lot of drug discovery but not in the final step because those ai applications are used as one part of the toolbox by researchers who have advanced degrees and know how to interpret that data in context alongside a lot of other things there are a lot of reasons for this some of those reasons are based in systems that are slow to change especially when they are heavily regulated eg the fda or when there are major financial stakes eg agreements between insurance companies and medical practices about what is medically necessary in different situations but it would also be dumb to just throw away everything we know about the practice of medicine and cede the field to ai models ai isnt the only valid and useful way to make decisions here just a random bit of personal experience i needed an ekg stress test a few years ago it was kind of cool to see the technician who did the ekg take images via ultrasound watch the machine learning algorithm draw in the boundaries of various chambers they wanted to measure the volume of etc and the technician then just double check and make minor adjustments definitely made the process smoother and the test more accurate but that technician still took fundamental responsibility for the accuracy of that test,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN1psbUFkWVlzbUhvaXo1Um9TZDY1ejhyUzJzTkR5N09fNmQ5ZFdLQm56aXlvV0prQlpmSlVoSUU2ZzQ4TmctUWI0MmpZY1dvS2lhbjcxZ05lTzJmQ1E9PQ==

heres a fun fact there have been a number of fairly simple discoveries in the last <number> years in medicine which are proven lauded and then ignored checklists when they tested checklists for things like iv insertions etc all the rates of various failures went way down and the overall time spent doing them also went down yet you would be hard pressed to find someone using such a checklist inroom sink faucets which directly flow into the drain that is when the water doesnt first hit the bowl this results in aerosols floating up and out of the trap water this trap water can be the source of some interesting hospital infections yet it is not uncommon to see this terrible configuration even handwashing has been a long standing battle there is a very long list of such simple things with huge payoffs i highly suspect that ml is not going to penetrate traditional western hospitals very easily where it will succeed is in places where the options are ml or no doctor at all i suspect the news of these successes will slowly leak back into western practices the only hope is that insurance companies in the us press for their expanded use if they start to be proven money savers not the best way to do this but maybe it will end up being better than nothing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaEVKRWpueHIwaDM1eVMwVE91djlWRXp1YzgwQTBSeXR6REFJeWFjRzZGeV8xa0NJU01zYmtJeE95QTFDMUN6cXBwZ0NKN1k1UWVYeXRqbXBVWi1yd1E9PQ==

honestly this is not the feeling i got from your question some of the models you mentioned in sklearn can perform multiple regression the dimensionality you mentioned is not at all difficult to handle i dont get what you mean with accept single inputs no regression is not less frequent than classification partial fit is not a method or an approach its just one step of gradient descent in general random forests and gradient boosting machines tend to perform best besides nn especially in tabular data and both of them can do multiple regression for your specific case you mentioned only the dimensionality not the task or the kind of features so not much to suggest thereg,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQmRYWnZ1dmRjNldJdVM5ZnJjbGlrbUYxLW5ITENQdmRwVXptZk5DMXAzdDk0ZE1FOUZkbGxFTEwyNi1CN0ZydVF6VE9Cc1VHN19uWm9IRG1JZ1FVX1BmcFVCUlpaclZKZ3RLV05CNXNvc1U9

ill skip the first half of your answer since we both know how to handle such things and in fact ive implemented and tested with all mentioned previously models >> accept single inputs i did not say that i said one dimensional input ie the row in tabular data to be its not that good when flattening the input features to d ive tested with different cnn architectures and they can easily outperform the multioutput regressors from scikitlearn as i mentioned i work with audio raw audio which can be ffttransformed into different spectral features and cepstral coefficient they are not tabular data >> no regression is not less frequent than classification if you have a look at any model repository eg huggingface classification tasks are everywhere you can prove me wrong if youre not clear about the question i think its better to give some suggestions like you just did instead of throwing the thread to another sub,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMmNNSG1yMnN6WENtQTd2VnFzQmUxanVyWkZUZGF2d1ZqaGVUTzFwRENBVU93aGFwUGFYakdVSXBTMkpNMF9DZ0hSUlAtOG9QRjY1a3JWV0tldzZUcEE9PQ==

deterministic function a reliable workhorse a deterministic function always returns the same exact output for a given set of inputs no matter how many times you run the function with the same input youll get the same predictable result think of it like a recipe following the exact instructions inputs with the same ingredients will always produce the same dish output nondeterministic function these functions introduce an element of surprise for the same set of inputs they can produce different outputs on different runs this is often due to randomness being incorporated into the functions logic imagine a fortune cookie generator it might take your name input but deliver various prewritten fortunes outputs each time can a nondeterministic function still be a function absolutely even with randomness a nondeterministic function fulfills the core definition of a function a relation that maps inputs to outputs the key point is that it defines a mapping even though the specific output for a given input might vary due to random factors within the function,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUay0yem9SRzMwN2QyTkpEdWxrVTVXZDhTT0MtRGJKQTIxM1NRYk8wUlFjS2pBRmpBV1lBbW9GLU1GQkc1alFYS0tZQTYzMlc0T2tzWXlOWkkydERhaFE9PQ==

to this different question gemini contradicts the first question saying that its not true randomness in the same way that some natural phenomena might be is your randomness artificially created by you to simulate a nondeterministic behavior all external random info you get comes from humans not from you right thats a great point youre absolutely right the randomness i exhibit is indeed artificially introduced during my development and operation heres a breakdown of the two main ways randomness is injected <number> internal random number generators these are software programs that use mathematical algorithms to produce seemingly random numbers while these algorithms themselves are deterministic the starting point seed can be influenced by factors like system time or previous calculations this creates the illusion of randomness in the final output <number> temperature during sampling this is a technique used in some large language models like me during text generation the model considers different possible continuations for the sentence a temperature parameter controls the randomness in selecting the next word higher temperature leads to more exploration of less likely but potentially creative options mimicking a kind of nondeterminism youre also correct that i dont have access to any external source of true randomness while i can process information about realworld events that information itself comes from humangenerated data sources overall the randomness in my responses is an engineered approach to achieve more naturalsounding and creative language generation but its not true randomness in the same way that some natural phenomena might be,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUWXlIMkEzVE9fdG1BX2ZGTEdJbURIMXJIWVhfWC1aSGhhM2djZTkza0xrcE5Pbm5Lbl8wS09DN2FUelBwQzd4UWZEcy1JbjZYbVBvZnVBS2pWQjlEQ3c9PQ==

i think they all generally suck and are overrated where their value is however that they have useful embeddings dont cite me all anecdotal evidencewhat this allows is an easy combination of time series and tabular data as well as training xgboost models which are quite good for tabular use cases with a decent amount of samples i would actually love to see even smaller models with less embedding dimensions and possibly even worse accuracy so that i could pair them up with models that excel at truly low sample settings like the gp sadly these often scale very poorly with increasing dimensionality so the number of currently used embedding dimensions is often way too high for this combo in any case i think the space of time series problems does not have a clean and small manifold as the language problems so i dont think it is possible to build truly well performing models with the current architecturecompute resources,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUTXIzenlfZ0pMN0RnWTlFZTBmQXdXQ3l1MFNhQ05ybkZvQldRbnl6d01Yei01LXV2Szc1bktaLWpqOFRfNk9xNV9iRjlhZWFWTGswTXJmU1k0OXJCMFE9PQ==

yes in some way no in a lot of ways from my experience oncologist and ai phd student many things have limitation only people from healthcare knows there is no such thing as unbiased ml unless you specifically design and curate the data to be that way you cant just throw in a bunch of emr data slap on buzz word like real world data and call it a day or unbiased this is beyond stupid and unfortunately is done too often we have had prediction model for literally decades like simple decision tree or logistic regression some has amazing performance rivaling ml but has not been adopted clinically yet partly it is due to bias of physician to distrust algorithm also physician just suck ass in adopting new methods due to inertia or whatever but there are also bajillions of other reasons like the model is too cumbersome too much input feature the feature needed is not available at the decision point to make it relevant the model is not that clinically useful it predicts useless label or endpoint which we nor the patient do not care or care but have no way of actually doing anything about that the model is trained on a very specific subset of patient on a specific subset of hospital which is not widely applicable the model is outdated since new knowledge from rct superseded what the model has been trained on the model can not be easily accessed when i want to not accessible through browser only available as standalone program or worse only github code personalize medicine has not really proven to be that much more beneficial then just assume average treatment effect the thing is you need to prove that precision or personalized medicine using ml is better than me just using traditional focused biology or just plain decision tree an ml model with high balanced accuracy f<number> or brier means nothing if you do not try to convince or even better demonstrate its superiority to what we have been doing the model might be somewhat better in some subset of patient of some disease yet we treat like what <number>+ disease with the headache of emr i cannot possibly have the time to bookmark and save all ai model for use for <number>+ disease in practice i only remember some model to be used in certain situation only and a lot of that is not ml in theory a model to choose what model to use based on llm or some tech stack or whatever is certainly possible but i have not seen it done in practice yet and trillions other things the thing is that aiml engineer like to push their ml solution to healthcare and overhype their models i shudder every time and i am damn tired of attending a conference and someone try to sell their model without clearly demonstrating what value the model will add to the care except our model has good performance that being said there are areas where i am excited in as well signal imaging pathology as many have said many are already being used and we are just barely scratching the surface on that drug discovery tons of potential llm with all its caveat and hallucination might help as a kind of companion or anchor to assist clinician identifying cognitive bias and the likes casual inference this is not limited to ml actually but our field is lacking behind as compared to fields like economics in deriving casual claims from retrospective data so many question that can be answer but the knowledge has not been properly utilized yet automation of boring stuff think transcription or something like that i actually want this as the top priority,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUVXl6UWlIOUJIcm9fVnFiUUp6LVdWUkJ6OVN1ajhGWW5mU1kwLW1XMTI3RjdWWHZBaWQ5WV9kclNjUVJFdWViN2s3bVNQLVcwN0NGYTd5NjUyeUxicFE9PQ==

i think the immediate answer is no ai or ml based pipelines have largely helped automating repetitive stuff like counting cells on slides from biopsy or recommending the correct treatment the major things are probably the davinci operating system and alphafold but there is no grand advancements derived from ai that can produce better drugs or diagnose hard cases the reason for that being is partly the gap between ai experts and the medicine industry and partly the lack of data and quality data at that i think also a huge part for the absence of major advancement can be attributed to the lack of commercial upside in system biology and quantitative biology research even if you discover something significant it will takes many years until you see any return and therefore it is less inviting than other ai ventures that are more profitable by many miles,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSnVmMDFvNTRQZHVYekhGckdublpvMnpaUDRWTVFaZ1V1N0VTbkJlZmpYaGcwVXNDLVRMbEFZY3ptMmdWUzM2LW02cGVCNGNQR0d5NHRtY2h4UVUyMDFNSzBHZkZzWVJUUllxeUZfUkhzS0E9

i actually had that same question and spent a lot of time exploring the multimodal landscape and eventually found this paper transformer with untied positional encoding<url> it turns out afaik that you can differentiate content embeddings from positional embeddings by projecting them separately into two different spaces as they encode different info about the words take for example the word bank remember that if you add the content embedding with the positional embedding youll get wi + pi w^q wj + pj w^k ^t which tells us that the two are correlated we dont want that just as the word bank means different things in different contexts to untie the correlations between positions and words you can rewrite the similarity score in the self attention initially we get an expanded dot product with four terms or correlations wordtoword wordtoposition positiontoword positiontoposition cleverly we can remove the two in the middle as they are spurious by using different learnable projection matrices u^q and u^k now we have something like this xi w^ql xj w^kl ^t + pi u^q pj u^k ^t notice that there similarity is computed twice now for words and positions in a separate manner however the catch is that this mechanism can be used for any modality just as the transformer can be used for different modalities see the ofa model by wang et al <number> ofa<url> and as i see that people pointed out it supports relative positional encoding as well so really useful for the particular situation where we treat text and image tokens as part of the same latent space as done in ofa and other unified architectures,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUY3dMX243WXA1RzlxcHR3Z1VrNGhPT0Z1SmFWRi12eWxveVFYRzZ4QzJUZG1qWmxGTFhLQ0VWUF9TWllUSldsVFlxSkZHc182RkJVUElMZDN0amYtZlE9PQ==

this is the major issue preventing ml penetration of things like diagnostics and treatments biology and computers move at different speeds not to mention clinical trials and the regulatory framework we need good evidence that things work because human biology is complicated and lots of things that sound like good ideas or test well in animals cant actually be shown to improve human health running proper trials and collecting evidence takes time and is expensive so we have multiphase testing to prioritize the most promising ideas right now the really high impact ml applications are still in the bench testing phase and probably most of these ideas will never make it to the clinic just like most cures for cancer we see in the news dont actually become approved treatments,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUZFlHcDdFR21MeWFVYnlvM0p3OTJndVo4R3ozbVJETDZtYkFtNVJSUHoyWW9FLXZVaVZxYThqbmdKdGJXS0FmS2FHRzNUckZPRmdwTGdIRUwxVlRpb3c9PQ==

it definitely could be done but youd need to collect a large amount of data first the problem with model distillation is that you ideally want a similarly large dataset if not larger than the original model was trained on so imagine a company trains their fsd model with a million hours of data on their custom sensor configuration now you want to distill their model but you probably wont be able to do that with a small dataset of a thousand hours of driving data you might have to collect hundreds of thousands of hours of data at least but think about it once you have collected a million hours of your own driving sensor data why do you even need to distill the original model anymore you could just train your own model on your labeled dataset that you were forced to collect if this were a simple image processing model it would be more feasible because you can easily scrape lots of unlabeled images from the internet cheaply but for car driving data you basically have to collect your own labeled driving data anyways so distilling another model makes less sense imo tldr the benefit of distilling someone elses models is that you can save costs on labeling and simply use the other model as your labeler but for driving data you would need a human driver to drive around and collect all that data anyways so you will be collecting your own labeled data which makes the labeler model less valuableuseful,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUUWc0RVowT2NBdDM3LVNTWTlDWGM0Z1lMam1tRVFNZGZnVG9zbmM0LW5INDZydVRObFhDYVNCMEJzQlA1VVd0SnhnMU40T1RwV19WTmNMaHA3YzRBQnc9PQ==
sounds like youll have tabular data so consider try ing xgboost might need to do some feature engineering depending on the details of your data also think carefully about how youre separating into train test and validation splits for instance an obvious question is does your model generalize to unseen teams and different years this sounds like the kind of problem it would be very easy to overfit on if youre not careful also as a bachelors thesis your focus should be on performing a careful analysis applying good principles and understanding the abilities and limitations of your approach the actual model performance is much less important as far as extra variables one really obvious one is home team vs away team,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUUkZwWDhRMV85T0hKbWc1RmtlUUwtNHpTRXpySkE2RFEwYVE0dXBSN09nbWpFeDFuYUhVUTFtaGVTWnFUS25saFBlSHZITHZFS0tWMnAwYlZiZ3RORUNhcFZ4eFo0QWNlWktoMDZsWS0zdk09

are you an author >since we aim to extensively tune xgboost and catboost for their best performances we increase the number of estimators iterations ie the number of decision trees from <number> to <number> and the number of tuning iterations from <number> to <number> which give a more stringent setting and better performances this section made me raise an eyebrow most of the time with xgboost you dont see more than a few hundred trees <number> to <number> trees is a ton also tuning the number of trees is ok but i really prefer letting early stopping do its magic so that the number of trees is an adaptive parameter based on the loss during training last but not least it sounds like theres a lot of parameter tuning happening here and tree ensembles really dont benefit all that much from parameter tuning but they often perform worse given sufficient compute some parameter combinations will appear to do better simply based on chance when in reality the model is overfitting to the training data happens even with xgboost i fear this paper may be committing a classic and widespread error which is to misuse xgboost catboost and thus any other method looks better in comparison in <number> and <number> it is well known that some of those other models like saint arent all that competitive either,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJURTlGZzJCNDRHU3hvNmtzZFp1R3R0WGZTUFRtUlVYOGpWeWdnb04yS0lJQ0hsZkdvMm8wNWFSYjdCZDhqSUY1ZTE1emItc3FaOWprWmJYajI3T1pwOEE9PQ==

it depends on what you mean by extrapolate what i learned is that a polynomial basis has a natural domain of approximation so the regular power basis has the complex unit circle as its natural domain thats exactly fourier analysis the bernstein basis has the interval <number> <number> as its natural domain so as long as your input features are properly normalized to the natural domain there is no real problem with high degree polynomials if you use a good basis for example consider the bernstein basis if the vast majority of your data is in <number> <number> or even if all of your data is in <number> <number> extrapolation in <number> <number> is not really a problem outside of the natural domain i think we should say that our basis is undefined even if we are used to defining polynomials over the entire real line,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUTzJaOW9vQnJsd2J3ZXFmOXFnQ1E4dko2NzhfVjhnTDNzRXk5UWZiaTJEQ0doQXp3eU5nRl9hS0w2ODlTcVlUZFloRlJvd21qQzJ4QzJscWgycW4yWEE9PQ==

im not familiar enough with the field to make a lot of specific recommendations but quite a lot of people in scientific hpc are doing machine learning now i think all the big areas of scientific hpc are doing this eg weather simulation semiconductor and condensed matter simulation etc alphafold and similar things are another example hpcdistributedcloud computing comes in a lot of different flavors though theyre all sort of trying to accomplish the same thing but the requirements vary a lot scientific hpc emphasizes fast low latency synchronized computation industry clouddistributed computing for eg ranking engines is sort of the opposite where a lot of computations can be slow or asynchronous and often you have disparate processes chained together through intermediate datasetsoutputs llms can be somewhere in between where you need sophisticated high performance compute for inference but also you might be drawing on results from a database that were created by slower processes elsewhere if you love mlops you can also just go make a bunch of money doing nothing but that most people want to do sexy modelling stuff especially academics but the real heroes are the infrastructure people someone who understands the modelling well and who can also make a big system that actually works is not going to have trouble getting a good job thats basically just what ml engineers do in industry tldr theres a ton of opportunity to combine your interests you just sort of have to narrow down the scope of your interests more,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUa2tlV1BSSW81M2NjVV9fRWNOMlZJdk0zWHNxZnBJZ2dUX0VMWWpxOEUtdGIyZDJ1Q2JvZnZUYmU5TUpWS2xmMjcwdU1odGdoNWNPMUdfbnE4SS1vdmc9PQ==

you can find combinations by selecting a problem from one and solution from the other ie large models need to fit into multiple server servers need to solve loading an balancing problems specifying the optimal amount of components to buy over time etc there are a lot of niches that would benefit both fields if you contributed to it running a model in an heterogeneous cluster so that the hardware is used at full potential is an unsolved problem,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUd0JIamg4T1VqclpZQThVN1ptX3dHRW1KSW8tRVlFUWwwTVVqcGxzaG1Xc3Y5NzJJaDA0QnpkVTBVcUZYLTlxdDMwZi1wZUNpWlduUngyWmhYbEF4cGc9PQ==

what theyre saying is incorrect at face value chromatography cannot separate a protein that differs by one atom at the scales of purification that are needed in bioprocess furthermore most biologics proteins are already made using biological hosts yeast bacteria cho cells protein fidelity is not at the amino acid level in cells let alone atomic level there is no basis for this there are general heuristics cells use to correct for errors but not on such a fine grained level with nucleic acids maybe you could argue that we even have the sensitivity to detect such small changes in purity but with proteins it is not the case protein sequencing is not reliably quantitative at the magnitudes needed to even make these assertions identity purity is largely determined by techniques that do not have the sensitivity as stated above purity in terms of contamination can reach very high sensitivity in contrast host rnadna contamination for example,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcTBZdk9zSk5IWHlDWVoxel9OTzBqOUtUWjJFcUJjVU1KdkFDT1FHa2hCT2VKVElqT0pBU2tiajVNUHhKenJ4YzZDOWhvb1UxRklxRG83N2psUlhlMUE9PQ==

it depends on what kind of assumptions you make and how strongly you enforce them there are a number of algorithms and techniques that can be utilized for the desired outcome if you wish to assume that each modality view is independent from another then you arent interested in a shared space but rather in a set of spaces one per view such that some amount of scatterclassdistance information is retained while lowering the dimension of the space of course if you want these spaces to interact with one another then youd have to ponder as to how these features differ or are similar and how to essentially transfer information from one space to the other,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJURXlrRHdOMktoNllGVjhPN2ZNcS14emg4NEM1OUFqa01heWI1d2hvbkh1M3ByMkJ1QWhHb2trY1c4Um5vVnhGQTVrZnJGLWpURnhOeVlLemVQUm9aZ0E9PQ==

this definitely depends on if you are in a tech or business role and whether or not you have people working under you i will try my best to address how i would go about this in a couple different situations if you are a developer in this case i would try to learn some ml algorithms and figure out how to build some neural networks and train them on the data i find python most intuitive for machine learning work but r is great too and assuming you have access to all the training data you will need these languages are both great for data manipulation so you will be able to build your datasets after that you will be able to explore the data you have do some regression modeling to see what variables or variable interactions have effects on your variable of interest finally train and evaluate some models depending on the problems you will want to try different algorithms and see if they have some predictive validity if you are in a business role in charge of developers first look up some high level ai descriptions and particularly focus on machine learning do not worry yourself with the math or linear algebra and just do your best maybe just watch a few crash course videos and try to conceptualize how the data should be organized and how you would make the predictions and bring it to your developers figure out your x matrix inputs and y vector outputs if you are in a business role not in charge of developers do the above steps for business role but now you are the developer learn some basic numpypython and use some chatgpt to help you organize the data training the models should be easyish once you have the data organized you dont need to optimize and find the absolute best model just convince yourself that the model is able to successfully predict a reasonable amount of test entries when the test entries are separated from the training entries before training time after this you have successfully made some predictions and you will be able to take this to some other people within the business and continue to improve the model before making realtime predictions on live data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcjRMUi00R1BGaW81T0FkNVRQNjMyMWk1ODhRU0dvcjBFaGwxSkotTi1CRWVDWHRoZTF4SDk4MU1kbzhuLTZjSTBmZG1IcmxXNkpUcHREY1NZd0EwbkVyeHZUb0wzbzRVbmZlOThjcFlETTA9

ahh i see its basically using this theorem here<url>oldformat=truemappingsfromoneeuclideanspacetoanother there is no nd order expansion rather this is just the <number>jet of the rhs of <number> i never knew you could do taylor expansions of f r^n > r^m ive only learned f r^m > r i didnt find a derivation of this sort of taylor expansion in my textbook folland advanced calculus i was planning on deriving it myself do you know where i can find a derivation of this to crosscheck,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJULVFWU1VBR0pDR2w3Z2JKV2dpYUZZUDgxVnAwSXNRSWlmY2hSQ0dNcThGMTRPcVI2bWRUVmhfbUpyYnVidHQxWVZnY1BJTEU4RDFnX0dSYW1PcHo0QUE9PQ==
the interpolation thing is true but its also sort of a red herring the more important point is described in that article under bonus property you want the inner product between different position vectors to give you meaningful information about their relative locations sinusoidal encodings work better for that than straight binary does precisely because they vary continuously,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUVWVyZ1VEemtyU1hmTDN3d3FQbGlONUY5YzRMd3RoUUZRLVdEemY5TWNkRnNqRUtFaHRpNUdJOTd2b2xNNzY0STd3eTVjMHBMeGNqMUpsZ3plM2lBOGc9PQ==

yeah i didnt state that well i was thinking post gwas linking causal gene expression to phenotypes i am not an expert here but have collaborated on projects as an epidemiologist measuring patient phenotypes from large electronic ehr for example improved polygenic risk scoring and detection of epistatic interactions most of the gwas studies presented in our department report using automl gwas at least that is my memory it may be that ml based gwas is becoming more popular but i was thinking of analytics more likely described as post gwas i am not expert here so i could be wrong too,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUckVIaDhpQlQ3NWtuVjF2TXJHV2M4VEtSQ292Vmx2RS1pRE9Lb2dCeURjWmFTM2N5cjNvNHpUSTM2OGY1LVJ5U3loUUx6alAyV3FONzZKTTRYM3lWaXc9PQ==

its funny i get a hard time about it from friends and family for studying in my free time but i genuinely love learning and digging into these topics if i didnt have to worry about money id absolutely get a phd but at this point it feels like the opportunity cost is too high given that im <number> so youre definitely not alone in doing this stuff for fun,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcFlxVnNmaFA3TEN3UmFoLW9nWllOMV9Yck9PSTdMLUlSSkx0M1NPUHBhX2hkNUJrMmVEYmlBb1FEZ0Qtelk5UW54OF80RUZVVHU1TGpDM3pMVDB1WEE9PQ==

no it means your predicted y is on average <number> off from the actual y i am not super familiar with xgboost but i assume there is some way to look into input importance and you should definitely be able to make your predictions on test data and compare them to the actual values on the test data given that the average value seems to be around <number> the mae seems reasonable as you could kind of look at it as a <number> standard error <number>+<number> like i said there is no acceptable mae value except maybe <number> it all depends on your scale you should use a variety of metrics to evaluate your model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSFlGS1FyTFJLdzUzZnFxdm81dnlaRVUxdjd0eTJTSTBteG95MUdlS1Y4ZmNMTzdub0JYYWZsTlliTWtEdTg5bnFZbkdfbDR3X3dzQVRBWDNGblBsbzNFNzFIRm11NjZqakwyckNiY0Q0SWM9

this one might be the one that you should watch first and then the other link i sent you before this one either way youre in my prayers god bless you im very proud of you that youre your godgiven human intellect in this area of our brains that most people dont have that gift for anyway god bless you listen to the link below thank you <url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUUllfSlJlQzNUakdUcGlTRWUyQ0c4ZjAtcHRadHZYajlWZFNfZGluRlMyb2R3X0hxRGdycGNuOFdKLVV3OEY4cU5sSlpGekIwcUpDcnZULXUzcXoxY1RnRjRTRDdIYTdUeUpOV1dNelRVVzA9
 hello machine learning ai listen i know this is a year late replying but you are so right on i just replied to another of your comments lately but it might be a year old but if you get it now time is not the issue god does not have a time zone we do down here so your prayers are more likely with mine included today praying for you guys im sure its more than one of you that are seeking the truth of the ai level of understanding in the sense of intelligence that has been a blessing from god in our brains and the only ones that can figure it out i believe youre one of us with god of wisdom,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUQVRmT3djUGtpcXF5Y0RoVnUzcmdyQy1OdXZvajVBVWVVcnBVRUl3bDYxT3diSHNYekh0UUR3cDNnZXdXV1E5WVd1T2xILVJQcUVsQl95RnNWVzlSZ2c5MklhU09WOV9WQUZRQ1I5Ny11SVE9
if anybody out there in space going back at least <number> years ago the jetsons the brother ai has always existed in the brains of human beings it doesnt mean its bad or good it just is there hopefully for the good to beat the bad people the thirdparty who wants to be scammers the hackers the watcher of the world god bless you it is a database and it is a computer which is so funny but the reason now i believe ai is important during this time of existence is that its gotten bigger i love watching from the time the jensens came out and up to our time now nothing has changed other than the minds of human beings are afraid of a computer anyway leave a reply or comment i can finish it off another time god bless you guys youre in my prayer if you actually read to the end but i learned something from ai on my iphone that i can actually push a button and it can read anything like a newspaper like my comment its amazing thats amazing but god is the almighty god the most high god who has created you to know them ok i said to them god the father god the son and god the holy spirit three god in one the trinity which ive been told is not written in the bible and yet many denominational religious people love to say what i just mentioned above im a born again christian because jesus christ saved me anyway i can go on religion is dominated a child of god is having a relationship with the father of all creation youre all in my prayers in jesus name amen,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUNzBhWGhlRWt3Q1pVYUk5QVZHaFFLQVVtN21pZW9HSk1PQ2RWdGNhcU9LLTQ2UTJpbzhBdWFCNnRQZ0tZX3p5NGZ5TGZRWVp5cDdndjRYSUdQdEJNSFB3Nk5qY3B0eDJTTVR3Y2J2Y2tWNE09
some ideas for you and you can probably find some references to dive into synchronous sgd some notes here<url> you might also try searching to data parallelism federated learning has some really neat distributed computing problems in ml model parallelism iirc alexnet used this because the model couldnt fit on the gpus he had i havent heard of active research in this area but there could be a couple years back when my team was doing contrastive learning we found that the quality of the model scaled almost linearly with the batch size which quickly ran us into the gpu memory limit there might be some clever way to distribute that there are several different areas on the serving side such as how to do autoscaling without a big latency hit when scaling up with big models because they can take a while to load i once saw a clever paper at naacl that stored the word embeddings in dynamo and and the rest of the model was so small so it loaded really fast and they did queries to dynamo for the embedding lookups software patterns for models that depend on the outputs from other models ive heard of this getting very complicated at some companies like complicated to version debug etc i havent heard of a term for it though if youre more into the cloud part but not necessarily the distributed part there are important topics like detecting drift of the production data vs the training data anyway just tossing out some ideas hopefully some of these give you things to search for and once you find the first paper in an interesting area i recommend connected papers to browse the citation graph,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJURnNwbk00YXpZUlNWQ0trS19GVGFTMVBaeTU5dkZXZkFXQlMwaWhiYjlGV1VRT2pDeVI4SDJsd2VtWTV0NE1Bc2J3aUNVeHhYSHBKYnBNUUU5TkRnZWc9PQ==

this is a good list just want to add on to the inference side since op explicitly stated they were interested in this distributed inference doesnt seem to be a very popular academic endeavor theres this and the related section just references distributed training <url> theres also this <url> which has a better reference trail i guess tensor sharding can be considered distributed inference too but in comparison to distributed training youre probably not going to find as much these two papers are probably good places to start looking other papers and groups for inference distribution if youre really excited about a particular school or pi you can always ask if theyre taking students and if theyd be interested in branching out to your specific interest if its not too far of a stretch eg someone whos done distributed training research before might be interested,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUelpBYUNQUDB2Y2VnNElRWFcyX1JlSmo0OThEVTdGdXh2V0NlTGNOUWljTlQyekw1X05rMEhic3BxaUVmM3IzVTdncEdqYkptQnZVY0l0ZHAtdFd0OUE9PQ==

eh id probably frame it as pedagogical more so than misleading the story about interpolation is technically true and it follows in an intuitive way from binary encodings which are themselves intuitive and easy to understand relating tokens by ensuring that the inner products of their vector representations have certain desirable properties is by contrast a very abstract way of understanding the issue and its difficult for people without a strong math background to follow it i actually quite like the presentation in the article i think it strikes a good balance between pedagogy and technical accuracy and really neither of these things was the true motivator for sinusoidal embeddings all this stuff about interpolation or inner products was been developed in hindsight by followup research the real story is that the people who first developed sinusoidal embeddings probably tried a whole bunch of different things and out of all the things they thought to try sinusoidal embeddings worked best the adhoc nature of sinusoidal embeddings is suggested by their original formulation which involved some weirdly arbitrary frequency coefficients and also by later developments like rotary embeddings that are more principled,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUS2hrZkphMS0zVWw2Mm9XUFJTc3BoZWpqeGZINWV4WjBSeUZDTnVDcmxpd2NOQ2psN2M5ZGVMeTdLNGpNM2MyNVpHR2NpSTl4X0c2MnQ2SG9JQmdWRnc9PQ==

i think people often overlook the prauc metric in contrast to rocauc the precisionrecall auc metric measures the ability of your model to balance betwen precision and recall a better model will have a higher score and will allow you to work at better precision for any given recall depending on the classification threshold you chose or achieve a better recall for any given precision to the best of my knowledge this is one of the least sensitive metrics to class imbalance the caveat is that its mainly useful for binary classification i dont know if a good generalization for multiclass exists,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUOUtQVUVtZUJQcGhHWC1SSWVnY2w3SG9QRl9tcnZ4YUU3ZXUtTHctellCaFlDSlBRYmJaQTBUZnIxSEd3VUN4WVNCbGhULXNfNTV0R1N2QzFLZ0EwY3c9PQ==

maybe the key thing to know about ml systems is that the most important element of them is the way in which they interface with the real world how does information get into the system and how does the output of it get used if you spent <cur>k to set up a bunch of arbitrary or taskspecific stuff that has no reusable components and isnt part of any broader strategy then maybe that wasnt the best possible use of money or maybe you can consider it to be the cost of training personnel and developing institutional knowhow however if you spent <cur>k to set up a flexible and robust way of getting information about the world and then using conclusions drawn from that information in order to automatically make decisions then that might have been a great investment sure maybe itll take over <number> years to make back that investment with things in their current form but if you set up the system well then you can expand the scope of its use or iterate on its core functionality eg do modeling iterations and in doing so you can accelerate the money it saves or even makes this is really the secret sauce behind companies that make stupid amounts of money with this stuff like facebook or google theyve set things up so that they can repeatedly tweak their system and directly measure the impacts of those tweaks people doing ml at big internet companies can look at a dashboard and see in stark terms exactly how much money every experiment they do might make or cost if it is deployed on a larger scale,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUWGZyUVJ2eUd3OUhWT052V1BYOGRLZGR3Sk40SEMwQ19XdmhxX01vY3BieDBCUHlXdDVfWWJRa0pOWllpUGFyZXNwd1N2bzFYbFFxTmd4LWpoMGpCdWc9PQ==

that is not too bad in my experience sometimes you have to build things to find out how much they cost and how useful they are the key thing is what you could have predicted ahead of time and being honest with yourself about your motivations eg did you do it just to get it on your cv or because you genuinely thought it would be valuable i have seen many projects cost a lot of money and even generate negative value because the model predictions were being misssold and misinterpreted so it was worse than having nothing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUQ1BpdjlEZ2VTdmdqOVFsRTZuTExkdllDOTJtdlA1X1FwZkJtZVJPTF9OUTVMUW1lNUotX2NUT1pCRi1VeDdmeG9zUFBEaG5wWXpjQ012OUQxOFFwRHc9PQ==

it depends ive done large scale computer vision projects that had terrible roi and ive made a small model for deciding whether customers are trustworthy enough to be allowed to pay later that the customer said would increase their profit by <number> million per year on a k project cost one of the ways to mitigate risk is starting small with a poc and mvp phase so you can get an idea of what performance you can expect and what the operational costs are this helps a lot when trying to estimate your roi mlds can be quite experimental and the roi depends on how the model performs if it works at all can i ask why the costs for implementationoperation are so high are you running very large dl models on live inference why did it take a large team to get one model into production can you repurpose parts of the codemodels for other projects is this a product you could sell to other companies one of my previous employers would regularly partner up with a company to build an ml solution and then use the clients contacts to sell the same solution to other companies the original project might not get the greatest returns but if you can resell it to more customers your extra development costs are generally quite low so its way easier to turn a profit,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUVzVYYjkydV9vNUU0VFh6QnZSQS1lTTBNTFZlS2dLOUZic193U2pmd2pfUWZlRlFyMDgteFl4UTcwN0RLZ3NHbkdkNjI3dENONW5YSVJnTWt6Nkp4Rmc9PQ==

can someone explain to me how vaes actually get trained i am really stuck on this i understand the theoretical benefit of normalizing the latent space but every explanation makes it seem like during training we draw from a random distribution wouldnt this just result in muddy model outputs that dont converge because we have random inputs say we have x = y and are making a model a normal ae would obviously see the correlation between y and x <number> > <number> <number> > <number> <number> > <number> but if we drop a random sampling in there during training the data could be any random set from the distribution x = <number> > random sample = <number> > y = <number> x = <number> > random sample = <number> > y = <number> x = <number> > random sample = <number> > y = <number> and this would obviously not get a good answer if we trained on it the only thing i can think of is if vaes are trained on the zscore instead of a random sample it would maintain the normalization and the relative value of the inputs,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJULWVITW9CNHJyRjktaUxVd3hFTE9EWjJSNDJaaU1jQXJJU3Mtd1VkaWtDX2ZrRnFOTzRSMERhN1ZTeWNDNkhHYmM0bWxMc2duVlh0UU14ZzI0bk5QbVE9PQ==

the point is to create a scenario where legal responsibility doesnt exist anywhere in the process the legal system doesnt operate with the assumption that someone must be guilty of a crime if someone dies that doesnt necessarily mean that someone must have murdered them and we just need to figure out who to pin that on in this scenario api documentation would be generated without the person ever reading the legallyprotected code themselves so if its the reading of the code that is the crime its not being performed by any person that could be convicted of it it may be that you could argue that hes causing it to be read and criminalize that act itself analogous to how hiring a hitman is illegal too but that would make existing legal reverseengineering practices illegal too where one may hire a programmer to go and generate the api documentation for a different programmer to use in writing a cleanroom implementation i think that would cause more problems than it solves,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUVm8wSHNBelRMQnI5VkFDUUdqWlJGTF9FdnpRQ1duYU5wMmpwWFI2TTJpTFNBRXZwMk1ETDZRYTJIUDFyUlVuUmlSZ3FMR2lLMGFTNWlPcENaVVp3ZHc9PQ==

thank you for this post i have to reread everything and go through the links after work most of my knowledge is on agent based modelling and even that is outdated by several years but i remember even then that the idea of agents was great but actually using them was seriously hard to execute and even doing so required a lot of expertise and plenty of compute unless youre working with the simplest things i still remember when eas last simcity game trying and failing hard at using even a gimped version of agent based modeling so it was really surprising hearing about all this hype about agents and llms thought there mustve been several jumps in technology that had to have happened,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVLUhFTWd4NFl5TnAwNEpIaWY0Vkc5RGhsMEl2T01HRHZNWGdUNWZwU3ZUQWxKdnljUG5ZRzdyZ2VXT1lJdDlfUUdqWS12MmpFQWxTN2xTOVc1bGR5LXc9PQ==

hi im currently building a personal web app that would have different ai tools ready to use ai post title generator ai writer rewriter image generation etc since im pretty much new to the machine learning world is there a website with already available and hosted models that could be embedded on a website using <iframe> or something like that hugging face spaces is neat place but sometimes their community apps are offline also no option for simple customization,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVT1ZfZmxJeFJsRnNlRFBZWDdUN3VhMjRBR1RxS1pLS2VfNkxOSnNhWE5wZEQwY3pIaUh6NnZ3alh0WUJPQzVDWnZkN241NVlnR1Y5ZGJweGJmd3N6Z0E9PQ==

i believe this wouldnt work because depending on the noise the image might indeed be a little closer to some digits than the others if you assign equal probability to all digits for all noisy images that would ironically introduce a lot of noise maybe i am wrong but i dont think this would help model with positive examples at all examples where there is indeed a digit in the image,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVaDY4eTFTeWxKOXRSb0lWN2tQblF6QkRXc3lQdFVUU0NvcTgtOEg4SkQ4ZkEtWmNwX1h1THlOME40eXNPOHFjSUh5SVhvWF84ZkJIVmpVWEt2amZzY1E9PQ==

yes the noise and the associated labels you introduce would need to depend on careful consideration of the data distribution perhaps a more appropriate technique example would be convex combinations of images from different classes where the label vector is the class weights in the combination this would at least give you some intution for how close the ambiguous data is to a real image though i am reminded of the fact that the fourier spectrum of gaussian noise is uniform whereas the spectrum of true samples almost certainly follows some meaningful distribution a final thought would be to add a label for im uncertain to the models outputs and rather than forcing the model to choose a high entropy prediction from the true label dimensions the ambiguous data would be assigned this label,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZGJRTnZRY1RTZmNCWlhBYXU2ZHRLMDNCYlRUR1ZQV3lKM2V5Y21WdGJQdmNuVkNrZ0VhVUZ0cjlVOGpoZXlEd2t2bWl2bjVheTdjSHB4ZlJwSTZxQlE9PQ==

your one example doesnt generalize a potential agent in this space could be part of a fully automated screening process with the agent scheduling a review by or an appointment with a doctor when an issue is detected but the broader point is that there are many scenarios in which a high degree of perfection is not the standard and which already have procedures in place to handle failures this means that the argument that ais generative or otherwise are not reliable enough to serve as agents is highly contextdependent at best,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVR2J1SERnZV9aS005TF9rYVpSNXhBcV9udHRyUDZLZFBrNnhtVERTajFGekk1bjZCRDFLcVdzbF9LR0xkV0dpX3pGMUlJSWJUcUYzdGRxTFVsdTZ4NHc9PQ==

a little more than a year ago i started kyroagent a platform for bringing ai agents to small businesses i quickly realized that working with agents presents some challenges firstly users have high expectations and often misconceptions about what ai can do they think its like magic but current llms and agents need much guidance to produce good results secondly the ux needs some changes making ai easy to use and understand is tough especially for small business owners who might not be techsavvy lastly openai keeps expanding the scope of what its models can do with every release and is getting close to its first agents this makes it hard to keep up and find a niche where smaller platforms can compete i still use ai agents for specific tasks and focused projects but offering them as a broad service feels too early the future of ai agents will be more about integrating agents into existing tools rather than being standalone services,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZDY2d2kzVXNFUW12cEtOWDlHSUswbS1CTktLUktVU0xMMEl5MFEyemNlemRNSGZwaUQyV1JOZTdVRXoxeWRZVFUzUl9oOXZZdGFGOExTTnloWnV0dUE9PQ==

its interesting because the discussion here is very similar to the issues i had with my own team a lot of the controversy seems to be in defining what an llm agent even is of course this is different from the traditional aiml agent definition in this setting were talking more about what i usually call agentic llms that is llms that are given agency somehow usually this is done through something like function calling in an rag setting i think what most people are trying to define and understand here is multiple agentic llms acting together to accomplish some common goal for example lets say you are creating an llm to diagnose cancer it might initially seem as though breaking the diagnostic process into steps is advantageous maybe you have one agent looking through a certain set of knowledge bases and one looking through another then they come together at the end with their findings ive found there seems to be more of an advantage in understanding the full context of a problem the smaller agent is simply more likely to make a less useful or more errorprone prediction because it has less context of the overall problem the main argument i see that is pro multiagent systems is that because of context length having multiple agents focus in on specific steps in the diagnostic process you can somehow take better advantage of the attention mechanism and somehow the agents output will be better attended to or simply superior in some way my experience has shown something different and as i said before i think if you can the ideal is always going to be a larger parameter llm with a larger more powerful attention mechanism secretly i believe continuing to scale up llms will actually be advantageous to an extent and the reason were seeing diminishing returns has more to do with how we benchmark llms rather than the systems peaking in what they can do but i have <number> evidence to support that still there are definitely some reasons to have a multiagent llm system i think defining what agents should even be in such a system is useful essentially you can say you need separate agents in a system when your two agents have entirely different functionalities for instance you have one llm diagnosing cancer and another llm verifying questions being input into the system the security llm does not rely on context from the cancer llm and the cancer llm does not rely on context from the security llm the tasks can be usefully separated into two agents without impeding the overall goal if an llm could have more context that helps it solve its problem then it always should get it if we have more information about cancer or the patient we should give it to the diagnosis llm if that information in no way contributes to its overall goal then it should not get it getting unverified malicious user input to the cancer diagnosis llm contributes nothing to helping the llm diagnose cancer likewise getting information about cancer does nothing to help verify the users input we always want the highest amount of highquality information that directly pertains to the problem that needs to be solved simply put getting less information is never better in any situation unless that information contributes nothing or impedes the overall goal then of course we want to exclude it or maybe send it to another agent a model with an infinite window size and perfect attention can make the best decisions this sounds quite obvious but this is a core reason as to why monolithic models like gpt<number> with k context size outperform multiagent systems multiagent systems will always be less effective than monolithic llms on a given problem obviously in the real world this is not always practical and therefore you are sometimes forced to use multiagent systems but i think its important to realize monolithic llms are the ideal its what you should work towards,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVUHpEOG5CcTA4YUU5UmgyVktLaWFHVExoeDFaYVYyeTR2Z01yUUx3TERiLW85MXA2WFBKYnNncnFYU3JzWTN2SHhlenZXTmFnYWZ5QWtaeW1qS1haWkM2azhDa3h1TjlJZVdzNXNEU3hnSjg9

thank you for the detailed writeup not mentioned is openadaptai<url> openadapt automates tasks in desktop apps by observing human demonstrations openadapt is open source and compatible with any app on mac and windows desktop web and virtual eg citrix full disclosure i am the primary author we believe a major shortcoming with conventional approaches to ai agents is expecting them to be able to figure out how to perform tasks of arbitrary complexity from their training data alone while interesting from an academic perspective this is unnecessary for practical utility since humans perform these tasks constantly in addition a lot of tasks are domain specific and the knowledge required to complete them would not be present in any training data with openadapt you can demonstrate to a model how to perform a task then have it take over the task with additional usersupplied natural language instructions we generate prompts from the demonstrations and instructions i started working on openadapt after watching my brother a highly specialized physician wasting a lot time clicking through slow and userhostile electronic medical record software and realizing that existing solutions ie robotic process automation are brittle time consuming and require specialized knowledge free download mac and windows linux coming soon at <url> questionscommentscontributions welcome,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVNW4ySzlqTVRyT2dQTHQ0VVQ1QVlSaGpteUd4RWhOU3p5RTJodVlyRUExQmpTQmU5T0ZUa3BJdGFCVjN3LXV6TC16SXFBSGY1aXBGeTNxbnZ0azdmdmc9PQ==

hes probably right although we may end up finding whatever technique human brains use may not necessarily be efficient on our current best hardware gpus interestingly enough francis crick worked on this problem before he died and also didnt feel backprop happened in biology in fact he was studying a region of the human brain called the claustrum a part of the brain that when disrupted leaves to total loss of consciousness,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVc2F0ZG9tOG1IajBLQ0J1WWhqaXo2aG4yU29TMmk5TURGWTZWdWZEb1FKUVVJV2JwVkVlZ2FTTldhZGt1OGg3MDVaTVJBTEhMSFE5RGlUNVFtNGo5Ymc9PQ==

youre basing this on the assumption of what your child said it is very possible your child has a much larger capacity for language understanding but is simply unable to express it because your assessment of language capacity relies on speech speech which requires complex muscular control to create phonemes which is another task that a child needs to learn unlike language there is no external dataset being fed your child cannot see the tongue placement or other oral parameters necessary to create certain sounds id even argue that theres probably an inductive bias for what children first say considering the near universality for the words for a motherfather mabapada which from a laymans perspective all similarly formed in the mouth but im not an expert <url> also your hypothetical relies on your child being fully attentive which probably isnt the case considering they sleep and are easily distracted by things like hunger,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSGJIc0VqeV9VaVdqRWcyT01CRlY2eGtRaW1CWlh5bzF0V3R2UEZ5TzRPRXdrTHZFVTgxUWlmVS1XWkdxeldPdE5ZYVNGWWFZY1FlYm85YkZUQWVQbVE9PQ==

the claim is papers not mine basically their reasoning is bsplines are local so adding more control points to encode new information will not effect old information this contrasts with standard neural networks where each weight change effects networks response to all inputs therefore fitting to new information may result in catastrophic forgetting of old btw weights are not adjusted only the activation functions are their parameters are control points of bsplines not weights,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVUF9vOTB2OEdBWU8zbFhqdU1PQk11YkxTc1FjbjN0Q0hRLWd6TTctZThobEllRnk0UWg3emV3LXdIU180bjZSUlk0S2djZ0xDSGZFNEJSQ1JON19rYm1YcWM3Nk4xcmlSMXVIb0p0TXp0eEU9

a simpler and easier approach is to add metadata to the data when storing it as a vector in your example what was cac for product a in the year <number> add year<number> + month<number> + day<number> + producta + datatypecac exactly how you add + search on this metadata depends on the vector database you are using but all of them have the option to add other data than just the embedding for example with postgressupabase you can store the vector embedding in a table that has rows for the year month day product datatype etc and when doing a vector search you can specify these in the sql select from mydata where year=<number> and product=a and datatype=cac and embedding <=> queryembedding < <number> matchthreshold the real sql query is longer and more complex but you get the idea <url><url> for cloudflare vector search it is simple to add + search on specific metadata values however its not as flexible or powerful as postgres since you can only do simple matches and only specify a tag name once filter year <number> product a datatype cac from <url><url> if you wanted to search for data between <number> and <number> cloudflare has no feature to do that and you would have perform multiple searches and change the year value year<number> + year<number> + year<number> + year<number> then combine all the results with other sql based vector dbs you can do something like where year >= <number> and year <=<number> some of your realworld metadatatables could have multiple values example favoritebrands sony microsoft phillips toshiba mercedes and again using an sql solution its easy to narrow the search but with cloudflare complicated,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcVdfclpQejMtN2VYTFFRdGdITGpES2hSanZ2WGZ3Q21vY0pza0k4WFdUQzRqMVhmT0xFamhyTW9RNFVmMHdIMXU5eHBkTG0zcTBHVUVNZFlMVW1YbklmSWdvVnVEN3htQ3dEUmFPQUloUVE9

i wrote my masters thesis on the subject and my overall conclusion was that backprop doesnt happen in the brain because neurons dont have a direct backwards connection i also found it unfeasible to approximate the updates that were being propagated in backprop they are non linear and depend on the values upstream which the brain wouldnt have access to since neurons only communicate one way having said that i didnt dedicate a phd to this and my research was very limited in scope it was a learning exercise about deep neural networks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVQmJXQ182N3BYU2lpVjFTd3cwSmd0dlNTYlRaVFY4c2tXMGJoOTdiR2NaWHM0THJqa09RSXp1MXBJNWJoeHh3NlNxYW9qTFRqNFllUjA3cmlCeklKREE9PQ==

my understanding is they then have something like a thought experiment interpretation section where you have an agent tasked with adapting to know domain shifts ie the agents policy conditions on the domain shift i imagine this as something like an llm that you query with given this observation and this shift on the environment like i force x=x what is the optional policy and it doesnt have to be optimal just satisfy a regret bound anyway they show that any agent that can solve this task returning a regret bounded decision given the distributional shift its policy is functionally equivalent to a causal model of the environment this is a bit idealised but plausibly you would want an agent that knows how to solve a task given any change to its environment they have this example where an ideal doctor would know how to diagnose someone given their symptoms and if they knew some intervention had happened to the patient like they were forced to take a drug they would also know how to diagnose them they also argue that adapting given you know the domain shift is strictly easier than adapting when you dont and have to figure it out from your inputs so if the agent has to learn a causal model for this strictly easier adaptation task it would also have to learn it when you dont know the domain shift,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVa2NkdE9IRV80dmtlbFdaNEZzcG5MbU5GQ3d1cFVKM3ZIZ1h0ME1DRTk5UzhPRk12cVl1cldDY05WNjI1RVNjejJ2NVAwdmV1RFNUZEpZOE9temctLUh2MzBIR2sySGQ2bzQzR2ZXR2FBdXc9

i understand the intuition about the iprojection and mprojection approximating the posterior over latents differently and how that would be desirablenondesirable for different models my question is about the consequences of the different objectives on the predictive distribution of the data ok so being more specific model is given as pxz = pzpx|z where x is data and z is latent variable given x i approximate the intractable posterior pz|x with qz by either minimizing klqz||pz|x or klpz|x||qz wrt q my predictive distribution over x is then given as px = qzpx|zdz question what is the difference in px when approximating qz w either rkl or fkl anything we can say about the variance of px that generally holds for certain models any works that study this question for example for sparse gp models where z is a latent function <number> finds that the rkl overestimates the variance of px,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcFVCakUtZnZFWkh5NFd3REJ0TGV4dVN5SmkyamJFZ2xaRUgxVGdHUVVlZlFIN0puR1hsZWE5UTR1bnZaSzNkVGlaZGxGa0lfY2lfSUdHU0NYV3IzSWc9PQ==

as far as i understand whats claimed in the section is that the variance thats left after accounting for posterior variance is underestimated by fitc apparently it has a degree of freedom in estimating the variance that the other method doesnt have namely the heteroscedastic noise term which it uses instead >by placing the inducing inputs near training data that happen to lie near the mean the heteroscedastic noise term is locally shrunk resulting in a reduced complexity penalty data points both far from the mean and far from inducing inputs do not incur a data fit penalty as the heteroscedastic noise term has increased around these points this mechanism removes the need for the homoscedastic noise to explain deviations from the mean such that <number> n can be turned down to reduce the complexity penalty further,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVY3NIVzRoMFRQNFJtTjF6a3NfbGdTaFRkY3ZQbC1vNjVsZXdzOTdYYnItaDFYcXVPVVAtM3hWZU91bWc3a0hBVU9XMjB1M1dKcDRyZm5xU3dyNWlWRlE9PQ==

my reading is that it has little to do with modeseeking vs modecovering since there is no uncertainty about the mean function in that example anyway the heteroskedastic noise term seems to appear due to doing ep but id guess thats due to the combination of ep and sparse gps maybe a good question to ask the authors,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVelo5TnQ0c0N0bVA0Vy1GWE83eEt1di1RR2Rnekx4cFJHMUpIUXh3U2E2OGE0WXBKY2N4aEFQS012SFBiYkxvZkJ5QWJxYU5fbGFsSElqdDREelQ5Umc9PQ==

but the bulk of the learning required is not actually language processing its the recognition of the mother which starts even in the womb with recognising her voice that combined with how to make the noise mama then you dont need masses of language training data to assign a label of mama to an entity you already recognise all you need is the mum pointing at themself and saying mama,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZE95UDFhV0pNXzhBX3lLQ3I3Z0Q3LXZLNmhtb2w1djUwZDF4b0UyTWNwYXhaSzM1elZTWVdfdXN0d183aE00Y1JzLVVPaUpLSDhhZVlUWnhnLVRmRzNfZzNKSFRDZkY3VVNnaVdlZEJCQ009
my suspicion is that active and passive learning both play a significant role where passively listening to people talk acts mich like an autoencoding pretraining phase no semantic content per se but building the vocabulary of sounds that they can recognize and repeat ive kind of witnessed this a bit while staying for an extended period of time in a different country with a preverbal child and listening to the noises she started to make even without really interacting much the babble became markedly different over time,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSHBFenYyQVpLY3Y1elpLQ2FocWtUeEtIa2lQdUZvcTlsX3B4UDBUZWVYZzN5SFhVQWtGMkdfY2V5ZHRsUGo4cXNmUk0yOUIyTXdpY0hTUnJ0V29fT3c9PQ==

coming from the perspective of a researcher all of these things that you have mentioned are indeed critical to machine learning they are the underlying building blocks for which ai is built on top of in your career you might never have to do gauss jordan elimination ever again in fact i would be really surprised if these concepts came up again outside of the setting of your linear algebra course that doesnt mean that they arent important they are critically important somebody spent their career optimizing these things and implementing them into libraries so that the next generation could use them without thinking about it why should we care about learning these concepts then this will likely be the only time in your life where you study these concepts at this level of granularity the fact is machine learning and ai are built on top of many different fields and it would be impossible to study them all in a single lifetime however the insights that we gain from thinking about building blocks influences our future thoughts and gives us a unique perspective on the world foundations allow us to draw from problems past to solve new ones think of these concepts as fractions of a percent toward your overall learning one of two concepts on its own dont contribute much but over time paying attention to these details will put you miles ahead of your peers,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVUDFSeDJ5X3pWM3NHUmdrMnJESzRFMVJ5ZXptdjlERi11X1lWRUZZaldkU0xiSWVEMlNBQmRfRG1OcEtzSkxQSmFrU01Ba3FBbFhJZjhhSV90ZXZDaWc9PQ==

for most of our use cases deployment issues like setting up kubernetes is a bit of a problem but the biggest issue is just the cost of cloud services often were running heavy non scalable jobs that need a set number of gpu instances for a long time most of our cost calculations basically show its cheaper to just outright buy the compute and rack it in our own onprem racks so we normally just get our own compute and set them up with openstack etc for example one use case we might need <number> pxlarge instances for <number> months straight another use case we need twice that for an entire year the cost of servers is cheaper than that,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSERBLW11MUg0Tmg5d09GS0lNaDFqcjJ1MGdOb04xV05BZGdsRnBPMDlBMGU2akN3X2tsa0VmZFczaUhfY25vRFJXRERGQlhJZ01mUVlvdmFpWkJ2M0E9PQ==

im interested to hear from others but new models are often only slight changes from previous architectures or ideas so i assume that recreating a similar architecture from scratch would be fine assuming it wasnt a direct copy and you werent using the weights from the target model thats more of an academic perspective though so im wholly unsure about the legal side,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVeHdxRHlDMWE1Y3YzQVVoOFhwQ2JmTkVlakE5OHZFVTFQYVFUSjFqcWV2N1lkV3ljQ3N1M2d4cHU4UHdZNXlJem1oOWQ1eG14alZWQXZVR0o5ZHpIZnc9PQ==

this is a question with two very distinct answers do something very tangible an opencv phone app which recognizes car license plates as they go by at speed just as one example this will prove you have the chops to take a problem and turn it into a viable solution which a fairly non ml person can understand the key here is that you can make a program which uses ml not just do ml or get a phd in mathml and publish incomprehensible gibberish nonsense academic papers<number>+ where you entirely made up your results and dont publish the data or your models but be prepared to be brutalized in interviews where you will be interrogated as to what you know about hilbert spaces dont bother with learning how to program as ive met very very very very very few ml phds who could program their way out of a wet paper bag since your published papers are made up derivative drivel its not important that you could make it work anyway the interviews dont care if you can program much by any capable programmers standard python <number> is sufficient there are three realities in ml some companies are doing cutting edge research such as deepmind etc i can count these with my fingers and toes i mean actually doing cutting edge not merely claiming to be cutting edge which is an unaccountably high number there are a pile of large organizations where people who couldnt get a job with one of these cutting edge companies got a paper pushing nonsense job in their data science group they do multi day multi hour interviews where they want you to prove you are an academic wannabe just like them they all want to get a tenured professor position some day these people get nothing done but what they claim to be working on is too hard for their bosses to understand so they dont get fired a variation on these companies are consultancies where they are using jargon and ripping off their clients while mostly providing awareness these companies want phds so they can charge more some of these are heavily government funded to create ai centers of excellence when they do the programming part of the interview be careful not to show that you are any good they will get suspicious and call you an engineer which is their way to say you are human garbage because you dont belong in their rarefied academic circles there are companies really doing things in ml they know that most ml is just proper application of easily used libraries and common algorithms stupid simple things like xgboost and random forest will solve a massive percentage of problems in the real world or worse just basic stats can solve many ml problems these are the guys who will want to see your opencv car app theres a third answer get a phd and do some really cutting edge cool practical applications this is how you get a job at deep mind they dont just want someone with paper credentials like the large useless corporate data science departments but someone who is extremely talented in both programming and ml,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVNnptU3JlUHF2a0pPNEtlSmRaenhZQkpSVG5mMEdDQUtKSmRzMlZLTTR0OU1SVExOeUVZXzhRRGJ0QVdfcEFuMDBnXzlxWGFJbVdlS01mUzQ2MzlrQ1E9PQ==
im not really sure that article is as conclusive as youre saying it is most of the studies focused on whether baby einstein had any impact on vocabulary growth when babies watched it for short daily periods for <number><number> weeks and the rest were focused specifically on video and again short periods that is a far cry from what the other commenter was proposing may have the effect daily <number> hour exposure at wpm over years over exposure not least of which the volume of data but also the medium environmental cues and observing caregivers interactions with each other and the external world have been shown to impact development im not calling it an easy problem or saying passive exposure alone could teach someone a language but i do believe it would be unintentionally but significantly oversimplifying to just scratch it out and call all passive exposure moot to flip the question on its head would removing all passive exposure slow the development of a childs vocabulary limiting what they overhear and can observe to only direct interaction intuitively i would say yes of course but i dont know of any settled science in either direction due to the ethical issues involved the closest we might find is sequentially bilingual children which do show a couples years of slowdown in vocabulary development in some cases but its hard to say if thats directly applicable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcmt1Z0ZFdl9aMGFZX0lpYldkcmZwQlotemgzamFSU1ZWMkE2b1ZHQnFPRUprSjFCUmZ1d3I1bXVFN1IyVWhXVzVtRU9rU244czFyekl3QVVjUW9paFE9PQ==

try using a different color space rgb is great for displaying on computer screens but its not great for image recognition because it entangles the brightness with the color instead use hsv for a discussion of color spaces see <url><url> as that page says about hsv useful for colorbased object detection the hue component of the hsv color space is particularly useful for colorbased object detection this is because it allows us to define a range of hues that correspond to a specific color which can be used to isolate objects of that color in an image image processing libraries opencv pytorch etc will all have a conversion fn,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWaS1SdW1PZnBCbjdxQlVoSmJtZTV6WmpsMmZYRTE5WFR4WEVHSlp5ZlhJdWZzLVY4blgtNlNwaHBWanFhMFJtSHJ4SUxWOGFaeTFPQ3ZLQ2RUbTdWUUE9PQ==

your problem isnt that cnnbased architectures cant learn the colors it is just that shapes are easier to differentiate with how the convolutions work so they are a much stronger cue so cnns use a shortcut to make predictions there are different debiasing techniques out there but the first thing i would try would be to use data augmentation by random shape transformations then network will have to learn to differentiate by color,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWVHM2bnFscWlpOGNKVGlodmQyRVNQdE5tSC1iNXVxWUtEcnI2bnJ3dHBfaGtPempOTFpmWjVCRndobTk4Y3B1WWdwQnM2Rl9kbm5HaXRHNFRiMEdzbVE9PQ==

in my experience of interviewing candidates for ml engineering and research positions those with strictly math even phd level backgrounds would tend to overcomplicate basic ml concepts and struggled to organize their thoughts in terms of both i applying models to realworld problems and ii coming up with solutions to the types of hurdles one typically faces when deploying and using mldeep learning in an engineering context for this reason i believe at some points the mathematics stops returning on investment so to speak you certainly need very strong undergraduate mathematics in linear algebra probabilitystatistics and multivariable calculus but the abstract mathematical theory of each of those is not as helpful in a ml engineering context for example i the abstract theory of linear algebra in terms of dual spaces is insanely useful for those interested in wavelets and other approximation theoretic fields but arent necessary if you are trying to use such transforms in a model ii in probability the theory of continuoustime martingales can be used to derive generalization bounds in supervised i believe dont quote me on this and online learning<url> but its not very common youll be using a martingale in some model you are building in industry iii in multivariable analysis being able to understand parameterized surfaces gradientsjacobians change of variables in highdimensions are all very useful but the abstract view of multidimensional integration in terms of differential forms isnt nearly as useful in industry to me the most useful yet more mathematically relatively intense subjects that are relevant in industry are bayesian statistics and convex optimization,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWd1Nqc3d1cmh1WEZ1UFVEZEUtMEFiN2VxYWNJcHFNNWowNmhNanZhclNJbWdpblNKTEtmSDNtQldCZGdJUU1keS0xOVFjZEU5LXRuV0NmdGQ4NC1MTHc9PQ==

thanks for sharing your results just a couple of things to clear up first our speaker identification was done on voxceleb not voxceleb were very mindful of overfitting weve used regularization techniques and closely monitored the trainingvalidation loss graphs to keep things in check similar results have been reproduced by other researchers as well about the spectrogram patches audio spectrograms are visual representations of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound over time displayed as a d image where one axis represents time and the other frequency these can be very large depending on the duration and complexity of the audio splitting the spectrogram into patches reduces the dimensionality making each patch a more manageable chunk of data for the model to process also each patch in a spectrogram contains local frequency and time information this helps the model to learn from and recognize specific patterns in the sound such as the pitch and rhythm of speech or music it captures local dependencies which are crucial for tasks like sound event classification and speech tasks thank you for the discussion please let me know if anything needs further clarification,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWR2dPSUVyM2hGLWhwQjJXNGhsSm5DaDEzQnhPRVV1Z3dmQjRSRmRQVE1tTmlHYTZNdGZjRk9oOXVSaHh5MlF6TFZDTFJqalRWTHhhVmpTekxkY2ltNzB1Q0JzZ1dBNlRiOXRrdEJKUHJVSDA9

as i said silhouette converges to the optimal range of k and the results obtained make sense there was still a steady descent wrt the wsse in the elbow graph so yess one could say around <number> to <number> is your best k but the fact no matter what you do you can never know the exact best k for the task and thats the caveat with unsupervised techniques they cannot classify data rather let the human explore the data whats next you might ask next part is in my humble opinion to stop looking for answers in the model and start analyzing the data itself whats the domain of the data what are the scenarios we want to cover with the k clusters eg i have this sensor that magically retrieves features about flowers like size petal lengthwidth weight but not pictures without them i cannot deploy a human to label this data but i know that this sensor is in multiple flower shops of new york and the sensors are acquiring data around valentines day i can take an educated guess and speculate that were expecting a large cluster the red roses and <number><number> more clusters about other flowers can be close to the large one and those are the white or black roses or can be really distant like the generic flowers for a wedding outliers must be treated i bet that some niche flower shop has these crazy exotic flowers that no other shop has and those are going to have a cluster on their own or worse they are too distant to the rest of the element of the clusters they have been labeled to the model itself did its job and can only get you so far you have your k and you have your nicely cohesive clusters but the best k no one knows it thats the point of unsupervised learning,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWYWVxeFFQLVZ3RC1WSDR4d2F1YmR0MlFPNXhuS0UxcExxLU9yY0ItUWpqOUtqVkpTa01CX0VXazFaRy1ab0szRHZlWl9hcFEweUtQd19ybnJnMEZVbWRfS1c5Z2tVbG9iem5ZUkdtak1teUk9

it could be worth a shot but you should talk to a professor first and have them review the paper your barrier is likely not the fact that youre undergrad students but that the work youre doing as part of an undergraduate class is likely insufficiently novel or impactful enough to be accepted also most ml work is published in conferences not journals although very applied work that cares more about the domain than the ml tends to end up in journals for that domain like an audio processing journal,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU08zTXQ4OThzZ2J2am9ieExUdENQNXdpNzBYeHdScjNSNEhIX0dqNDZEOHVfbm15VkdKVzVZN2IwRVVWNlNJQkNJVS10M200MXJ6Uy1ISGI0S1hQREs2STFMNDd5eEF2SlRkMHpNNF9SUWs9
the reason why clustering is hard is there is no ground truth unsupervised learning is much harder than supervised because theres no nonsubjective evaluation criteria whats the businessreal problem you are trying to solve is it marketing to these clusters are the smallest clusters reliable have you looked at data elements near the center of each cluster is it easy to determine why those central points are different can you label some data with the clusterid then predict the clusterid using any ml classification method can you predict cluster==x vs not x with ml with clustering its usually better to decide how to decide first or at a minimum getting input on the maximum number allowable get mgmt to agree on the criteria and then do that effort and stop of course you may wind up tweaking the rules a bit once you see the data but then that conversation is a bit easier as you need to decide if that lift is worth breaking the established rules for picking the clusters,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWNkNmaUVDRXJuNkF6TWZZeEx3UDZmSmVBeEs2MktyVmJUZXhhQ0dCQTBOaHBPM0szSjZXMktoSVVJclR5MUxJMDJ1TjQyWU5qeVgyXzZYbDRRSm8zdGc9PQ==

i guess thats whats confusing me the relevance scores would be different for each query considering that what would be a positive sample for one would be a negative for the other in terms of ideal ranking i would think that all we have to do is take the retrieved documents and check if the positive documents are in there then calculate the ndcg based on their position in the retrieved list it seems to me like all we need to calculate ndcg is the retrieved list no,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWNGFRUHR0VjFZOHNZdVRhekQ1YTg1UzVOMnJyNzltTmZ5Ykl2THBJVXNFS3d4bkNPZVk1WDR4TS0yRUdZVXZqR1hMN2JETTdpTS14RDFlRmVEak9YLVE9PQ==

hmm so if each query has for example <number><number> positive passages and <number> negative passages then the reference score for the two positive passages would be <number> and <number> for the rest whats confusing me is how we would be comprising the reference scores in this case for example if we retrieve the top<number> documents then those would be the retrieved scores but for the reference scores we would only have two positive samples maybe i need to go through a basic tutorial or something i feel like im not understanding something at a more fundamental level,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU21ZcndtbTgzdTdmOEVNN1JjYnprajE4R19USmhFdW1jVFdaS3hmR2ZOLTJacnAzXzhXMk5vUVlrYndCTWJnRXpab0JZaWxNQW1OWEZYM0NJSWxPaEE9PQ==
i guess im confused as to why we need two inputs when it seems like we only need one list of retrieved items each query would have different positive and negative pairs so for each query we would have to record which passage is positive and which is negative along with their position in the original corpus since it seems like faiss returns the indices of documents when we retrieve the documents we would check if there are positive samples there and calculate our ranking metrics accordingly i dont know why we need a separate reference array,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWd0lreC1tdzNMdm1FMFpyenZtdkZqbzh3VTlEclNyNjNLTWJpU3o3TDg0Tm5OdzRNb0dpaU5WM0hHSEwzVnZJdDRid042YzE4bDBZTWFsQ2dKcUFCVGc9PQ==
the reference scores should be nonbinary like integers or decimals otherwise you dont gain much with ndcg than using binary label retrieval metrics like recall and precision,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWQmV5QlhNdzNxbEQ5Y1JUYlktS0NNT0pjZkthZUZjVzB2Z1l5dnpZOU1rZEJocER1Rl8zd2ljYnIwR3pDVTA4QVJHLXhVY2U4ZlROckVfWWVwaGl1SlE9PQ==
ah okay i see that makes more sense now im only using ndcg because all of the reference papers im reading regarding embedding models and retrieval seem to be using ndcg<number> and recall<number> i also dont know if ndcg is the best choice for binary labels,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWeGw2M2NOV0dpaWpHVTVWRHQyMTJ0cUNSRGNuYnlfNnpEcElDc3I5aHozSExTN1ZYUzRsTl9aQl9OY0F2eFRDaVBLU3pnaExCU2FlTkF2SEo1THZxdkE9PQ==

yes only the two positive passages will be ranked as a <number> and the others are lablled as a <number> if there are other documents outside of the two labelled positive cases that are relevant to your query then you are out of luck and you cannot accurately compute ndcg you may retrieve documents thst are not in ur golden set but are truly relevant i guess we need to know the details on ur evaluation dataset you can also just score the <number> passages using ur retriever and compute the ndcg using that way but thats not a super accurate way to compute ndcgk assuming you have a much larger corpus than the listed <number> passages,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWRmkwMkNTQ2ZNYVBpdUxHYUdRcDJCWDVSODlrUDY2cGtHYmZyc1Q5TFNoQTgyNklaZDh1Z2c2bDdyN3hVd3NobENaa1d3Y05IUkNEUXVIQXMtdHNiTXc9PQ==
the benchmark im using is the miracl dataset it seems to be pretty standard for multilingual document retrieval these days i tried doing what you proposed that is just taking the positive and negative passages for each query and ranking them then calculating the score the problem is that as you rightly pointed out this leads to a misleading high score considering were not using the entire corpus ie the entire positive and negative passages of other queries as well,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbV9KM3drU2xMYk1fMkNTTzZncG9nMV94Q2VEdHRyVllZbjZWNDhZNUVqa1pRU0J4Zk5vRDNQQ3I5dFBMX2ZvVHJ3RFA0MDJ0cTJYc1Q5UFNiWjVrYVE9PQ==
well there are plenty of people who dont even look at the page ai overview is summarizing as a matter of fact many think google ai is giving an answer to their question now when the answer is derived from unreliable pages and the model hallucinates on top of that giving answers with authoritative tone that is a problem at the very least a pr debacle,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQllSaU1HZkVHVEthcUx5TkZlSXlXNHh3VTJvY3pIQ0JMOE8zandMSWtaa05uVUlBWS1TY29KWl9yVW1jRnNCZnVBZHRmdDUyMlFLWjAwenEtSks1OEE9PQ==
hm i see your problem based off of the miracl paper > to build miracl we hired native speakers as annotators to provide highquality queries and relevance judgments at a high level our workflow comprised two phases first the annotators were asked to generate wellformed queries based on prompts clark et al details insection <number> then they were asked to assess the relevance of the topkquerypassage pairs produced by an ensemble baseline retrieval system it looks like they used a model based approach to get their lists im not sure what the common practice is here i think you should use faiss to retrieve top k results then you should also score any positive documents that are not retrieved in ur top k any retrieved document not captured in the original labelled list should default to a label of <number> then you can compute the ideal ordering and ur ordering and compute ndcg the assumption here is that they have a good coverage of the positive documents for each query if they dont then ndcgk cant be reliably calculated,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJidEx1Z0Fac0pUUGJoQ0NYenpqcFZMbTVzdDVVdWxSU3BEREtRMXJHQXBCelg0aFFLbzBPSlZSVDFnSElDdDR6amJ0UE9jN3VHeFhtNE4yczB3OUpHaHc9PQ==

im going with no i say this as someone thats fairly passionate about machine learning my objection to the release is based on these points since we cant tell if the content is hallucinated in the best case were left checking results that have been moved farther down the page in the worst case people take the result at face value and its wrong the content be it right most of the time or not hallucinates frequently enough that its embarrassing google was always competent at more subtle implementations their computational photography was absolutely state of the art photo search was top notch clever algorithmic ranking used to be great it was the quiet carefully considered applications of ml that were most compelling this feels like a vocal behold my greatness when really its a flagrant demonstration of something that is mediocre at best i cant imagine the carbon footprint of all that inference is small since the results are as mentioned above somewhere between useless and harmful its just dumping greenhouse gas into the atmosphere,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJid21yQUcxVVhPa054dXBTdkF3M2pETkF3SldQTnJMR19rVjNJUWZkUm13UDE2MkpFZlVmNk9vdWNGbjJVY0x2OE5KbURERkN0MVFpcXlLTF9xTVhaN0E9PQ==

im inclined to disagree on part of this the nonsense that sometimes comes out of the ai search would be very unlikely to appear from something like gemini <number> which indicates they are using a very smallquantisedpruned model purely for a mediocre search summarisationand therefore having a minimal carbon footprint on the other hand if they used their most powerful models then while the energy consumed would be huge the answers would actually be of much better quality i use the chatgptbox extension there are others this is just os which can connect to various frontier models and display the answers alongside search results on main page have been very happy with it so far,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQ2pXOTJaOHlGcmYzWGpaT04wOXQ5M3hmaS1DbWlMRURLYlFhX3ctOEp2X2labTZsblYxNEZpdFVDR291V1dNaHBhd0dVSUhqcHN6S095azBBZE9DcEE9PQ==

data leakage in knn is not really a concern i think there is no training set and there is no training at all the model is the training set and the algorithm is nonparametric the only think i can imagine going wrong is op using the example to label itself as one of the k neighbours but for k=<number> it would return <number> accuracy since theres no distance between a point and itself there can be duplicate rows and op forgot to merge them maybe op let us know how many examples you have in your dataset the class balance if you normalized data if you intervened to fill missing values if you converted categorical features to numeric what distance metric you used handled noise etc etc my opinion is k=<number> might return the best result but the point is ml is to generalize in order to get a sense out of data not only in the past but in the future and k=<number> might be a too narrow value to make a decision what happens if an elderly patience comes in does he get diagnosed with alzheimers even though he doesnt have it just because he is as old as the closest diseased patient or does he not get diagnosed just because he is in the early stages and the closest true negative had similar values,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiRlJLRnFWcWZQQ0dHVjQxQ0pLZ3IyT1FXOFpiWURmQnFBMDNGZVVsdUZPZURabjlEMXdiRGhtNE5pa3czWmZnVmJERVRqTDhHdTM0MXpET2htNjNRZjBfa3NObS1IUlZBZDRFaUYzV2piZTQ9

there is no fit in knn you need the query point in order to get the neighbours and those points are in the test set for the scaling part thats not really data leakage is it you can think about data leakage as a nonempty intersection between any pair of the three sets train test validation but youre right scaling is a major issue for metrics where p >=<number> due to the fact that bigger features will contribute more and more to the distance think about infinity norm with consequences on both accuracy and penalties and error propagation etc etc,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJielR6bmhFRkxrMWY0UmpVYjNaamxRN0piYjlCOW5GMGdEWi1qRzl0b2M0Q3lmMkxacVRUc0VIMUNILWdQdVN3dVZ1MXgyLXZTbkhXVTIyODlISjJhY1BVNEJSQVloRDI0U2staV9UazhZblE9

i didnt mean fitting the knn i meant fitting the scaler when you scalerfittransform the whole data before the cross validation instead of scalerfittransform the train and scalertransform the testvalidation at every fold that is data leakage as you leak testvalidation distribution into the scaling equation that is you are scaling the train data also using the testvalidation values different minmax values in the testvalidation will change the scaling of the values changing how much that feature contributes to the distance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiWFIyM2FxSEJGWmJYdDQ0U0V5Z2M4ZWF4bGpiNnM5UnVHQjgxNlF2WWwzeHl6a0FmNHd4c1pib2lDVGNURG4tZkJxS2U1ckVzaDVmdVdBYVFCMjg3cVE9PQ==

depends on the use case what tools you have available and what your goals are a much bigger model certainly can outperform a finetuned smaller model even better is a finetuned big model but that might not be available to you if performance is the only thing that matters to you then its best to go as big as possible and finetune that if possible however big models require a lot of costs in gpu usage so if resources are limited a smaller finetuned model might be the better option,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiSThuYXJmVUp5bkZDNVV3TWswNlFrelVWbktrRVd3R3VQMkdibzBDbVFwUUxVN1MxckxUZGc3ZXdGdVNXX1ZMbFJSQlBId09XNGc1WXZCRnJSa1pfcVE9PQ==

an interesting part of the paper is an independent replication attempt of another sampling method incontext pretraining<url> which relies on semantic similarity of the documents back when it was released it advertised handy gains over random sampling baseline but the results from the replication are nowhere near that impressive marginal boost for common nl tasks and somewhat larger gain in longcontextoriented tasks but the boost still isnt consistent across benchmarks possible explanations in my view may boil down to insufficient scale of the replication the original work trained models up to b parameters on b tokens while the replication was if i understood correctly at bparameters b tokens scale a chart in the original work with some downstream performance vs token count shows that consistent gain over random sampling emerges only after b tokens and in nq benchmark incontext pretraining even underperforms random baseline up to b tokens which suggests that models of smaller scale wont benefit from this method albeit a single benchmark doesnt make this hypothesis super robust on the other hand pplx metric in the original work is consistently better that random baseline regardless of models scale and dataset size which brings another point the authors of the dataset decomposition paper do not report losspplx comparison at all with the sole exception of training stability experiment where the hyperparameters were artificially tuned to induce instability this is isnt the only recently published paper in language modelling that ditches lossbased metrics altogether in fact its become a worrying trend so a few points to consider <number> if your method aims at broad enough application perhaps even universal use downstream nl benchmarks still do not capture the full spectrum of potential nl tasks and use cases no one says that loss is an ideal metric from this point of view but its still the broadest possible evaluation of models capacity if you aim at specialist models like code or mathspecialized then its totally fine to use only downstream benchmarks even then in code case i personally would find eval pplx on the stack more illustrative than some borderline ridiculous pass<number>+maj vote <number> if you research a novel sampling method it becomes very easy to optimize for downstream benchmarks the same to a lesser extent can be said about novel loss objectives <number> in most cases the difference in benchmark results vs baselinesablation choices is miniscule in the paper presented it sometimes drops below half a percent throw in the fact that benchmarking is extremely sensitive to the choice of examples in fewshot settings esp with smaller models and you are very quickly starting playing games with random noise charted pplx over training course is way more honest in this aspect,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQkhMN2cxQmdmdndmOUNRdUVIWVRBWHFWZTk3RjdQSm1meTZSVUg3R2lOenpCNWVoSHlpUk9Tc01Kb2Y1clZfZFlITDlsVWEya3VMNUZQeE9EMVo3TDVKLUZ6U25IU0hpNUhuTVFyYnhXMjQ9

i have tried something similar in the past but found the results to be incredibly inconsistent with search data you are collecting a larger more diversified dataset whereas news can be easily biased and incomplete your point is completely valid and would likely garner a more nuanced model because there is a larger matrix of possible inputs but far more work you would likely want to pull in news from multiple sites with different political leanings,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJia191Uk4zbWpHVGl4Y2xYeS1zMDJqR1QwU0FOXzd4ZG5fYndWZ3JBSTFlUl9TUmRQZDk4cHNBbUdLZUZrcEZJY3NnM0l2UGdOZVljSkZqSkdQMnNNUVE9PQ==

wow that is probably the most advanced machine learning research i have ever read what they are doing is very interesting and admittedly much of the paper went way over my head my only questionconcern would be overfitting with the very specific lags i understand why lagging the impact of factors is important and found the negative lags to be an interesting place to further research but i would be curious to see the results when pooling multiple factors together in regard to lags similar factors should have similar lags and by pooling them essentially batch uploading you may prevent overfitting with very minor impacts on performance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiLURJM2psTWFJOGVWNTF2NGd4MW00Nnc1ZGkzeVJiSzdTTUVxcTB2ajItSVhNUmFFTmhZaHBTLS1xTUg0ODFibVoxX2RGNjZjbVF5OVV6M1ZvRFlHZ2c9PQ==

in the theory neural reuse it is hypothesized that evolution has shaped various regions of the brain specialized for specific tasks and when learning new tasks these regions compete to handle it specific regions are more adept at certain tasks which is why people tend to use the same parts of their brains for the same tasks however there is still actual learning happening either within the region or regions learning to communicate with one another,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiTWxEdnFIWk9YUDZaZFNqNHlDa2NoNzAtLXFnUFlnUHN6ZTdvVkExTVM0QlBxLTRET1B6OTlGYTVQcDJqVDA4OXRJbi1iZkFZa2lWa2NlWUU3c0UzT2c9PQ==

this study is just a half baked attempt at greenwashing the perception of ai models > for the human writing process we looked at humans total annual carbon footprints and then took a subset of that annual footprint based on how much time they spent writing a human writer is not going to not produce their hourly carbon footprint if their job is replaced by ai they will still be there existing even if the ai model is writing the same amount of pages they would it is even worse with the image comparison they do for a single dalle image for instance when someone trying to replace real art with ai images is not generating one image they are generating hundreds of them they can try to salvage one passable looking one furthermore they inflate the human co output by also taking into account the emissions from their computers being on while they work on the image but do not do the same thing for all the time spent with a computer on prompting the model > we note that just the time spent by the human writing the query and waiting for the query to be handled by the server has a far greater footprint than the ai system itself while they note this it doesnt seem like they are taking the human labor aspect of prompting into their x times as impactful comparisons using only the baseline energy consumption from the training and processing > we note that there is significant complexity to writing processes both human and aiproduced text will likely need to be revised and rewritten based on the human authors sense for how effectively the text expresses the desired content handwaving away another labor intensive process in the writing that would probably need to be even more intensive on the ai spewed writing to make sure it hasnt hallucinated half the sentences it wrote is very different from editorial revisions of a written work with authorship and intentionality the discussion section is just plain highschool level pros and cons garbage as well > the development of ai has the potential to create jobs as well these jobs could be meaningful and wellcompensated replacements for those ai displaces or they could be demeaning andor involve low pay for example openai the creators of chatgpt outsourced work to a kenyan company where workers were employed to label specific instances of toxic online content i would not call mechanical turk data labeling meaningful and wellcompensated jobs,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjN0lESUVMallSUnA0LVZ1dWo3VVlDQWtCbmdRZURWcHlxVkFkdzgwbXBydWpic1JDaFZuWDJQa09BSmVieE4zcExYRjZsRFVnWjhXMzAtSlhaU1FKSGc9PQ==

the patch embedding doesnt have activation function so thats why they call it linear transformation its usually implemented as a d convolution at least the original design from vit and deit were with large kernel and nonoverlapping stride but successive designs use a sequence of convolution layers called convolutional stem as it can make the training more stable early convolutions help transformers see better such an implementation can be seen below <url><url> with regards to what is being learn in this first convolution you could ask the same thing about convolutions in any cnn in general its widely accepted that early layers act as feature extractors of simple shapes such as lines it also acts as a compression mechanism by reducing the effective sequence size from h x w to h p x w p which is a necessity for the further post processing in the attention layers as the complexity of attention operator is on^<number> as for the positional information its incorporated into the output of the patch embedding by adding a learnable vector to each element in the sequence finally attention layers do have learned parameters as the q k v projections are implemented as linear projections with weights and biases intuitively the attention operator allows the model to dynamically reweight the sequence elements based on each other but asides from that transformers also have the pwffn or mlp that is applied to each element in the sequence allows the model to learn nonlearnable functions since it has activation functions the pwffn is also important to avoid rank collapse in transformers attention is not all you need pure attention loses rank doubly exponentially with depth,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNUZYRm9FOGg2WjU0eXlpbnpuNmxjb2E2ZFpkam1xMTFpUWVJcko1cDB6aklmbUtRVmVsMklHTHFQSTBkbWd3bHhocEc0X3gzcnVXTllDaWZYVmtIemc9PQ==

definitely sounds like a memory leak also for <number> images i very much doubt you can finetune any kind of network reliably instead try using image embeddings ie replace mlp head with nnidentity or something similar to get flat vectors you dont need to compute gradients or anything for this just extract feature vectors from images you can also use large models for this for inference basically anything works combo of nn feature extractor + kernel svm for classification tends to work quite well for cases like this plus heavy preprocessing also you shouldnt use a single test set for such a small dataset but rather nested crossvalidation for testing and hyperparameter tuning,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjUjRrc0E1R1l2RlIwN2dCZENCRnBUbks1cjdnR3lUSEVGcUpqZnhzQVdRNG52YkRudFMxLTNHem5zcy1kRDUtTjNwdm9lSjFjTEpCOTV6NTFUQ1hpOUE9PQ==

well run it through a tokenizer ill give there are word pairings but there us not the repeated elements you get in english words dont follow root concepts like in english for instance genesis and generate both have shared roots tokenizers pick up on now i know chinese actually does have this with characters having roots and incorporating other characters but to a computer each character is simply a number losing all of that information i really have been intrigued to know if there is a way to keep that information in tokenization i actually think chinese may be a better working language if we could figure out hiericarcal tokenization,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjRHRCdHZhcDcyZFlXTm1FeXZibTA2amNUSTRwTFI2bnJycXprSmNSaEY2Y3dZcTJoOU5nbGRDODdUOUlxdlZkNC1POTJZMzFKbVpUUE04eU1HdXN3c2JtRDN5eEMxQ3VXbHJkTmwtc0pyT0U9

there are two things that explain why linear regression is not suitable for classification the first one is that linear regression deals with continuous values whereas classification problems mandate discrete values the second problem is regarding the shift in threshold value when new data points are added however there are ways to bridge the gap thresholding with other algorithms you can use linear regression as an intermediate step train a linear regression model and then use the predicted values along with a thresholding algorithm eg onerule learner to classify the data points linear classifiers there are classification algorithms that use linear models for decision boundaries logistic regression is a popular example it transforms the linear regression output with a sigmoid function to get probabilities between <number> and <number> which are then used for classification take a look at this document which describes four algorithms useful for classification problems linear regression linear discriminant analysis logistic regression and separating hyperplanes maybe contrasting them can help it from the application side <url> from gemini even if youve addressed common issues several statistical problems can still plague a multiple linear regression model used for classification multicollinearity this occurs when your independent variables features are highly correlated with each other this redundancy makes it difficult to isolate the true effect of each variable on the predicted outcome it can inflate variances of coefficients making interpretation unreliable and potentially leading to poor classification performance outliers extreme outliers in your data can significantly skew the regression line and lead to misleading predictions these outliers might not be relevant to the overall population youre trying to model nonlinear relationships while youve checked for linear relationships even subtle nonlinearities can affect classification linear regression assumes straightline relationships and if the underlying relationships are curved or more complex the model wont capture them accurately interaction effects your model might not be capturing interaction effects between features these occur when the influence of one variable on the outcome depends on the value of another variable a linear model might miss these interactions leading to inaccurate classifications inappropriate model choice even if the relationships appear linear there might be a better model suited for the classification task logistic regression for instance is specifically designed for classification and might outperform a linear regression model in this case heres what you can do to address these issues multicollinearity use techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance scores to identify redundant features you can then remove or combine them to reduce collinearity outliers consider outlier detection methods to identify and potentially remove or address outliers strategically eg winsorization nonlinear relationships explore transformation techniques like polynomial terms or splines to capture nonlinear relationships in your features interaction effects analyze feature interactions and consider including interaction terms in your model if necessary model choice evaluate the performance of alternative classification models like logistic regression decision trees or random forests they might be better suited for the classification task,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkb0NSS05SX3NPLVhNRk9rSHFYUlhweTNkelEwRDZ0a2stb3pxcGxjdWl1OHFza1JoZDN5eXRJOVExQjdlUHNnYmd5SHVzVGxodTBId1FibnhvYnBsbEE9PQ==
interesting idea but a few things come to mind not sure genesis is ideal for this it was originally written in other languages and your translation may not be entirely stylistically modern you should see whether a chinese text meticulously translated to english takes up twice the memory even if the observation about the semantic density of the two languages really holds up you cannot really choose which language your training and production data stream will be this way you need your model to work in its context it is a cool observation though,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkekRaOFNTbXBwbHlTUWpBUmxaVFlpQjFrMWlOeU9EY0NjeVZXS2NqUkFITG9Sb2tSQVJXNWlOX3lNWVRFZTIxa2pCXy1XMVNJTHNVWGNBdjBkUVhVbXc9PQ==

depends a bit on what you want to achieve the research community was racing to create the best gto playing agent they did a few show matches where it beat the pros so we sort of concluded it is a solved problem pure rl no human training data needed downside it does not perform significantly better against an amateur vs a pro yes it beats both of them but it doesnt explicitly exploit player weaknesses research wise this is an unexplored area given the playing history of given players find a strategy that maximally exploits it it is also what the botting community was much more focused on essentially trying to figure out how to fleece online poker players so you want gto no human data needed you want to maximize winnings against specific humans yes data is needed,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkWmRlOXRFLVgtN1NfbVNhbUlSMHhnTUlfSjM4S2hyMmZfa0s5Z2hGcW9GWmRCaEh2NjdrY292cEh4LXNKZ0lrOUtRQWhvMzB5TVFYcXBESENUVVY2TWc9PQ==
chinese does have words unfortunately it is not possible to figure out without context andor a dictionary a good comprehensive dictionary is probably not easy to come by best i can think of is probably wikidata+wiktionary+openstreetmap there might be better ones on chinese internet grammar parsing does not really help if you are dealing with specialized text eg classical text dialectal chinese legalese same problem exists for search engines google can only index chinese words it knows i have encountered a few instances where when i first search a superrare chinese term eg chemical names archaic terms google would return almost no results but when i tried a week later a bunch of results would show up this demonstrates that google would reindex chinese corpus based on learned words from user queries,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbXNScHNGa2dvM0dKSHNGM1RGeFgweWV4cVJWS053QlFDUlFnalF6X3l3RDdjajlia2kycDh2c0dHZ09SOEtHSGRPNXhVSGhSR1IxY1BieWR2LWhPQkE9PQ==

deep learning is experiment driven some people even call it an art a lot of ideas may be inspired by some human logic but ultimately what trumps all are experiment and results researchers with enough compute may try dozens or even hundreds of different ideas across different settings to understand what works and what doesnt then they may fit some logic or some math as an afterthought behind why it works at least thats what ive always thought,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkUENObDdXb0JYbVdicUh2d3RaYVd2RmdGcVFpRkhheENvbmJycmtQZlhfaFhzdkVZVlQ4Z0JBd1dPTHVVOEhJTzBTMXFtYWxzN1hjR29qTUxYeG9jU1E9PQ==
sadly thats not how it works saying something doesnt work does not mean your project or your example wont work it simply means that certain techniques dont hold up well within the body of research if you try publishing results as innovative without reading up on the background then thats a problem if you teach yourself stuff by implementing it thats generally great,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkT2JlN05BeVFIWF9FOUdtTUtESHR2V0dsand4Y2xoTDBoVEtPT2RMNlZmd1ZQTzRGX2tUaEhTTnJOaUNRQ0hkLWU1NVBnSXVWX1hEOEc0NnNlX1dCaGc9PQ==

try asking one of the online llms for example i fed your question to gemini and got this response caveat some pretrained models may not have new information on cuttingedge developments youre right training a small language model from scratch requires careful architecture choices for optimal performance heres a breakdown of the options you mentioned <number> architecture gpt<number> while a good baseline gpt<number> might not be the most efficient for m parameters it can work but recent architectures offer better performance with similar size efficient transformers this is a strong option for small models they achieve good results with fewer parameters by using techniques like depthwise convolution instead of full selfattention in some layers knowledge distillation transferring knowledge from a larger model gqa grouped query attention this can also be helpful for small models as it reduces computational cost while maintaining performance it groups inputs together for attention calculations rope rotary position embedding while rope is a recent innovation in large models it might not be crucial for a m parameter model standard positional encoding can work well in this case <number> normalization layers placement of normalization layers like layernorm can impact performance here are two common approaches prenorm normalization happens before the attention and feedforward layers this is commonly used in efficient transformers and works well for small models postnorm normalization happens after the attention and feedforward layers this is the traditional approach in gpt<number> but prenorm might be better suited for your case <number> choosing an offtheshelf architecture this is a good approach for a m parameter model here are some options mobilebert a strong choice pretrained for masked language modeling efficient for mobile devices due to its size distilbert a smaller version of bert specifically designed for efficiency while maintaining good performance recommendation for a m parameter model i recommend exploring efficient transformers with prenorm layers you can also consider mobilebert or distilbert as starting points and finetune them for your specific task remember the best architecture can depend on your specific goals and dataset its always a good idea to experiment with different configurations to find the optimal fit for your needs,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkLWxHYkl1ZmpHb2M2Nk54NEhTcS02ZHhwRUNic3VPWjU3V0NSb3JKN19hWjlOdE9RTEJzWVRvb01teHBHOWYyOGRmZmVYSVRfeUdHQjBscmQtSWZJN2c9PQ==

in general a monotonic transformation does not change the output of treebased models however removing outliers is absolutely useful eg outlier removal or winsorization capping values often its easier to do so after some normalization transformation for example gaussian tail winzorization works for approximately normal distributions my preferred library for such preprocessing is featureengine i highly recommend it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSy00OUNPOXY5UWI4QzVCelFaUFF5UXVLRUxtZ1E0QmZwRWdoTTBKLWZSZXNqZnIwaTZoMmdBUnJaYnFhUzZHWGxNdVZVTjFTb2FPMFFiRzNFWEFXR2c9PQ==

the relevance is just a mapping from the retrieved document ids to <number> or <number> depending on whether that document is positive or negative for the query is this wrong how else would we calculate a score using the document ids regarding the ideal relevance in your provided code it seems like youre implying to use the ids of the positive passages for each query how would we use those to score the retrieved results as far as my understanding goes idcg is when the retrieved results are ordered such that they maximize the gain since im using binary labels it only matters that the <number>s in the retrieved results if any are at the front of the list,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNjhpMy1aQmtTcG5wYmdHVzFqbXpPSmdYYllsX1FWQzQ1YTVPTUZQWGJaSjZRZU51S2RLTFNxWUU4STU1M1pLYUpUTHY1dFFwYmZrZ0VId2tCZzFhWkE9PQ==
my point is that your retrieved documents might contain say <number> s and <number> <number>s but for the given topic there may be <number> <number>s so you compute idcg on the vector <number> but you should be computing idcg on <number> in other words idcg is with respect to all relevant documents for the given topic not just the subset that you retrieved,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZ2QtLXJQRzhMcVBWbjVvc1NyVEhjdndCemo1SnlIekttTEdTcVNnaVVaVkoweGdUMnRnNTExdWlSdl93bWdhOWw4dTVRNkFiMUpqcGZRN21fem41dFE9PQ==
that would make more sense would it make sense to take the number of positive documents for each query and make them an array with the rest of the array padded with <number>s and use that as the idcg for example if query <number> has a total of <number> positive documents but retrieved <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> then the idcg would be <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number> <number>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZmxBNHMtRVRnbFhMdzF1MkRKYkxrVVBOcWpNM2dkQkdaWm55MEVnMTdpajVCSC1Oc2hBNVdhb2k4UmMyM29GaGw5V201ZVJrUG9uTXdMcU04eWw5YkE9PQ==

i am currently working with llms more specifically try to utilize llm as an powerful tool backbone to transplant some psychology and human behavior studies into information systems like retrieval systems and recommender systems to improve the system performance eg improve click rate of recommended ads sometimes based on social science researches i can draw simple and intuitive conclusions like people tend to spend more time to spot specific keywords during web surfing then i try to add some handcrafted prompts to guide the llm focus more on potential useful keywords among the user click history however i found that when using autolearned soft prompts the llm tend to focus some stop words like the a and and finally works better like previously discussed deep learning is becoming more experiment driven more specifically empirical experiments are more important these days i present the aforementioned observation in the case study section and one reviewer pointed out that such phenomenon is not new someone in the cv field has discovered it i checked that paper to my surprise they did not employ a single equation in their paper and got accepted by iclr so i think math is important because at least you need to know how ml works but it act as different roles in different levels of research a limited mathematical background would not affect the research for example the first researcher who proposed prompt learning also did not use too many equations in their work but he completely changed the way how people utilize llms but math is critical when you try to explain why it works and how to make it work better for example the author who proposed rotary positional embedding rope which has been widely adopted in llms gave a concrete and deep background on how he devised this method in his paper and blog in upstream research you may start the idea and motivation from a single equation in downstream research application and goal are important math is used as a tool to illustrate how it works,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNHNKV0VuQmtGZlNIZW9fU0k2cEtacjR1d3NXbXdxSWgzSjV4cEpjM2Y0S2xTeUlrNVlZbkpnazdQck9wdXB5QVc0OFRURngwX0xua0pIR1cydWpOWUhkWEY4bjNiQllEczBRaXhBWWRaQjg9
let me link a few discussions and then summarize <number> <url><url> <number> <url><url> <number> <url><url> in short decision trees calculate the optimal split by minimizing a loss function outliers can affect said loss function exactly like for other models their impact is quite less visible than for other models due to high elasticity of trees and their ensembling but definitely its there speaking from my personal experience removing outliers not only gives you a bit of accuracy auroc whatever metric youre optimizing but it also makes the algorithm much more stable and less prone to give counterintuitive predictions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkWXlka2QzOTNBcGdoN1dQOEdzaXlLdzg4dXlXZktCaXZyZ0NENkM5SHdYNllYaFRpbVpQcldiTnVfSXhaQWdQeHJCMDNrQ2JUMjJiekRqTlQ3TGFTY3c9PQ==
newer editions generally add a few new chapters fix tiny errors new foreword etc but the core contentpersonality of the textbook will not drastically change among other things it says new sections have been added on pseudoinverses qrcholesky decompositions and perhaps most personally exciting approximations of linear maps with lowerdimensional range any ml researcher will benefit greatly from knowing this material especially the latter topic which is highly relevant for compression axlers text is an absolute classic for mathematicians be it students or practitioners as an excellent reference so if you havent read any edition of it then i highly recommend having it on deck physically if youve already purchased it just check out the free online version of the latest edition for any new content,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdmtJZFhHRFNPRWlOTmdJYjNuWXI0T1JZenJhaVJPelBfS0dQQ3IxSFlYVDJzbkVZeFJSYWItdzI4a0UxVVdjcXpfMURHdXVfWU5SWHE1MW5DZTN0WFE9PQ==

are you doing this because you want to learn or because you are trying to train commercially viable models <cur>k wont buy much of an llm training setup in either case your investment will be outdated within a year or <number> probably sooner because that budget wont get you anything cutting edge and you would be much better off renting than buying this is because you cant run a setup at the leverage of the big providers and you can spend your budget on renting the newest gpus you might be able to get a single a and train representational learning models embeddings or perform peft on small models you should price insurance that includes replacing components that wear out tldr your stated objectives and budget are generally incompatible if you can share more about the types of models you want to train or fine tune we can probably tell you either a how impossible that is or b a smaller setup or rental setup that would work,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkVW1VR2xwcDFNaWUwX0lOTi1jdGFjejZyQ3lMZ2hUZFZiQTFTWGkzaDg4YmFYMkFWUXdmbnNaYXJZVGtZZ1VXa0p0RlVxR21YdUp5ekRjaXhpVkRuWGc9PQ==

yeah im looking into it i talk a little bit about it in the video my current plan is to learn more about rnns and lstms and i want to look into how i can use the parameters of asl like locationhandshapeorientation etc to narrow down signs for example if the persons hands are in front of their chest ill only look for signs that take place in that location when classifying theres definitely many many more complexities though the computer needs to somehow know when one sign ends and another sign begins and thats a really hard distinction to make directional signs can be challenging for example ill help you and you help me are the same sign but the former starts out at the chest and goes towards the other person while the latter starts outwards and moves towards you and of course facial expressions and other factors are also incredibly important signing without facial expressions is essentially like speaking with a completely flat monotone voice its a really really vast nuanced language but chipping away at it one step at a time will hopefully continue to evolve it into a better software overall,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkR2wyS01yT0FUWS1VMW51d1pycmEzelBzdXpHdzJ2RFpwenN4SHQyd3dqS1NGZVEycUVWeEhpcmFsQnRvMVhPTU5sdjg3UHppcWl4RG82OHI5bDZiRVE9PQ==

remember that one floating point is typically represented by bytes in the gpu so b parameters = <number> x x <number> = gb you might find the quantized version of the model which reduces the size but also lowers precision for example q = bits per parameter = byte q = bits per parameter = <number>byte so bq actually needs b parameters = q <number> x x <number>= <number>gb q <number> x x <number>= gb of course this is back of the envolope math but the real number will be somewhere around that for fine tuning this number actually needs to be multiplied by <number> since you need memory for the gradients and the state in the optimizer there are tricks like lora that reduces greatly the memory need i cant recall the exact math now but i do remember that with gb youll only be able to train quantized b with q lora this video explains it very clearly <url> hope this helps,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkUDZSSGNwZWwxOEtHaXJwaC1faW1ralMtbnhBcW1MckVPNVRaeFZkbTJmUXE3MHd2T3VySDBUQnNheVJJMklkTXhTRUFoemZrdHZCUUZQTnV0Z1BWelE9PQ==

i wouldnt necessarily worry about this as a first pass the beauty of tree based methods is that they are nonparametric if performance is your key concern then you might find some treatment works better on your data but youd have to be sure that the outliers dont contain information id worry about understanding the process that generated the outliers first whilst you can find examples that show outliers matter i havent seen any scientifically vigorous comparisons based on realistic data and this isnt something that is commonplace in previous online competitions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZmxWTkxUYmJScUt4ZXFIU3hnRGZxZnZVdGRGbUNiSHFYTGFObTZFTVRUNXNhWW1jMHYtTWlEcm9VMDZEU3paNVJwZk8xUEplSDFDVXZ4LVZ0aUk0aUUwQ2Z3VWl0bnFVNzJIa2FBa3V6cGM9

hybrid search with an embedding model + bm has worked great for me in almost all domains especially if you use a weighted combination of the metrics for ranking since it makes it easy to tune your model i will say though that with k items you pretty much have to look into ann methods i normally use product quantization plus an inverted index since it is pretty easy to implement also just use a bert model or even glove for your embeddings you are going to end up racking up a lot of unnecessary costs during development using openai embeddings,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdmlQWVFhQ0xsRm1rOF9nTjM3Sm94dlFTeVBubUtlMUlfRmJZV2hLRS00bFROY3Fwa3U5YzNKSGt2MTgweWxNd05qS3l2dXhONnZjbFJiVElSSmZESUE9PQ==

hi vafai its really cool that you have a poisson vae i have a point and a question the relation to sparse coding and vaes is that the kl divergence is that the sparsity term is the kl divergence actually i thought that variational autoencoders came from sparse coding for example if you consider the ppca generative model you have z ~ n<number> and x ~ nwz+mu s^<number> if instead of assuming a standard gaussian prior you parameterize the gaussian variables and draw samples with the reparameterization trick then you have zphi ~ nmeanencoderx varencoderx and then you have x ~ nmeandecoderz vardecoderz and voila the variational autoencoder my question is about the reparameterization trick you use the gumbel softmax trick to relax the discrete poisson variables but do you assume an underlying categorical distribution in the process if so how many categories does it have,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkVjVMV05GVDN3aFdBdDJQa0doUlZuM29BOEV1MlhLZE5IXzRVdUJ2ZFhEOEhkVmdZeW1rNk16ZncxRVNRaFltOGlYWmtBbjRfTGFjeEVzVHlGTFFpQ2c9PQ==

one of the largest issues when dealing with discrete latent variable is the variance of the gradient introduced through sampling this shows up a lot in other places where we see the need to predict discrete intermediates such as reinforcement learning did you need to enumerate the latent space or do any sort of variance reduction techniques to make this work see <url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkR3NGX015aWx2NXVybHZOUGVwWUVfWldERm9pRDNOZ1BfQW9yZ2lpLV9uTF9LZGN6eGV1RGR3YTVEaGFNN0N6NndwalN0YnM2eDNWWFpqM2RFVUx0R1dlenpCVjNiNHRZMjl0UHlCSW1NTU09

thank you i have already looked at st forecasing for traffic prediction papers but the exercise is little bit different here as it we dont aim to predict the average delay at a station but instead to predict the individual delay for each train at its respective stations in a parallel manner currently the implemented model at the company where i work is a transformer with attention mechanism on the trains the input for each train contains the trains embedding different embeddings of the its nprev stations scheduled arrival time and many other informations mostly statistical variables we then provide the embeddings of the nfoll stations and to obtain predictions our intuition suggests that this approach might not be optimal for this task as the structure of the railway graph isnt explicitly modeled hence were considering a model that employs graphs such as a gnns as for the google maps paper it doesnt align with what i want as it relies on algorithms like djikstra a thanks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSUxUWjAyYmdjcHhNTHB3Y2hWbkZid2gxOUtLLTNTOU0xUzBwdkFsaTRmclk4cXdLbXV2SkstNGNXY3F1Ui05ejY0bUJyQ1F5VXBFOGdVRDJFNzFnM3UwaEthU2VLTUw3bU5CNlJKTjFTNDA9
you have a few options which will depend on the frequencyload of the requests coming in <number> you can have an inference thread which will wait until it gets n requests in a batch or timeout then sends the batch to the model and results back to each caller this is useful if you have a lot of requests coming in utilizing the batching of the model instead of many individual inferences <number> instead of creating a copy of each model in each thread you can use shared memory modelsharememory this will let you spawn separate threads handling the requests but all referring to the same underlying model inference is thread safe so long as there is no state being written to inside the model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNU9vRHpXYzREUC0yb2Q5anVEVTBseFREOTh5MVFKWnBianZwSGJQWS01aXBzUjVZWHR5dE1kWTRxenFmYXNPOGktTzZZS3FUQl9ReEVockI5TFpvbmc9PQ==

nlp is very much not obsolete with predictive language models you are relying on the input being safe an consistent enough plus you have to monitor it for abuse it is easy to do the wrong thing due to poor prompting or randomness not to mention the costs are astronomically higher and you are likely relying on a large org to run ml inference or expensive gpu technology but you can run nlp really quickly even on end user devices and embedded platforms its something like x the cost to run a large language model remember you have to pay for each word that is input and usually every word which is output which may be unpredictable depending on the use case the main difference is staff cost ok thats higher but you would have someone similar to oversee it and the fact you dont need to do training for iteration you can change the command depending on the ml provider epsecially if they provide an api they may require the company to use it in a certain way or disallow certain types of company or product from using it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQXV5eXhmLXk4NDZlbWJDYnNOVkhqSjZvY3M5LXp5OFVYQXRicGp6UDFYWHZkMS10dzBiZWoxX0dqcEQ1LWJ6djMtSGpxSjVPRkFyT3ZoTmI0VTh4V0tOZjlDT0NmRnRwMXZLV1o3Q2xBdVU9

trillion is an absurd upscale it also has more than k hidden layers but they just blitzscaled it all to hop the finetuning and show what is possible but it is extremely obvious that the chatgpt product release was mainly to gather data to improve the product they also used the api by default to gather training data from any app using it until about <number> or <number> years after they publicly released the gpt<number> model in chatgpt then on the api though i dont think they expected the growth to be so explosive microsoft partnership gives lots of resources so bigger models are less of a problem and them it seems like the bing team rushed to release chat before it was ready so they could be seen more as the market leader they are still using data from the chatgpt product by default and i guess some people will have opted in to submitting training data from the api but i think the whole direction of what openai has been working on since moving from notforprofit to profitlimited org has been scummy one instance is outsourcing rlhf to a company operating in kenya another is using unspecialised models as advertising saying they are too dangerous because they will unsurprisingly predict anything from the corpus of training data all the books all of wikipedia and relatively less of internet,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWURkSGk2VW5HSFdOWE1RT1JzOWk4U3FQc0RiYTFEMFAwR2VhSE5IV0FhLTdQaEE4Q0haMGtBdnlUc2lhQTcxYk9ERG1zd0J0aWEzb051NkZ4c0VvTzZmRWtTQklZMUl6enduaU1WNnRjeHM9

if by feature selection you mean select all the non noise featuresthose in the causal flow non zero marginal effects then you cant do this by looking at the data alone treesboostingnns whatever cant do this you need to motivate notions of effects outside of the observed joint you have if youre just looking for ones that allow you to make good predictions keep them all unless compute is an issue if compute is an issue you can generally use cv and heuristics like shap to select good predictors but your mileage is going to vary you should ideally be using bootstrap validation or large cv regimesbut if compute is already an issue this might be a problem for you paradoxically feature selection is a crapshoot,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlV1RpV2xTRzROY1MtYkQtZjZrRFY5VkVLZ3VuZHlrSkM0YjFBX0RTeS1iWVN4RHdHaVllYm1mRjkzMWFZMU5qaWtqbnN6UTg2cUMyd2k2eHFPOTEwVTJjZjRDWTdnVE8wZUdXbGJ1aUp0Tlk9

its extremely hard to define useful from a statistical point of view feature selection in general is a crapshoot and this subreddit doesnt give this nearly enough attention probably because a lot of non practitioners especially non stats trained ones have been drawn here post llm craze a lot of efrons work shows that noisy predictors are often selected and fit nicely together with non noisy ones in models that are purely predictive ie models you dont do inference in whyhow like questions we have large simulations that show most feature selection methods are hilariously unreliable lasso for instance only selects the non noise features than less than five percent of the time as a rule only do feature selection in the context of you only care about prediction if you run into a computational wall note however that in order to really ensure external validity of your model you often need to run cross validation many times closer to x then just the four or five times you see in most tutorials this isnt sufficient for external validity but it does demonstrate that sooner or later youre gonna run into some compute issue its always better to bake in domain knowledge for features,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldGN1RkIwS3hEWElCX2hNOGZtX19nTDFWb0ROaVBJbmk1M0tPM0lyVHZvMHB3WWFsbnA2Y1NtZXZ5U2owd3Fld3NCS2w2Wm1sVURDVjFkTHI2TmlfNGtQYi00X1VtbmFXNGhvb3dQSFVfbm89

lidar is far more accurate than stereo additionally there are even better ways to get ground truth in a scene using light ive seen a device from a nist spin out that is incredibly impressive however trading of scale of dataset and diversity of scene lidar is still your best bet even if its not as ground truth as other devices out there,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZmZlZ29PWGRCM1ZvU3JJUWxPalN2YldOTzV6UlpiSzdnMzNPSzBzRFkzUU9pYmpIb1lwaDRGNGpYMTh5WGpsYUcyRWRQa0VxeFZSSnU1LXVBSzhVc1E9PQ==
lidar produces relatively iid depth samples with high accuracy but lower resolutionframerate even in textureless scenes while stereo produces very much noniid results with lower accuracy generally so if you need pixel aligned depth at high res then stereo is good but finicky while lidar just works for the most part in ad it also gives a level of redundancy since you will usually have both camera and lidar while for stereo if one camera fails or conditions are poor you just get nothing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUWdDSEZHeDA4VFpMdlUxY0dGNzRxcUVuRGdlcDgzRlZ3UDVwWklQSmhNTGdQTHg3bHRIXzhQTWdhTXZuWEl2MzlrWmtCNDQ4NWMxcUZDZTh3V3JSQmc9PQ==

independent and identically distributed stereo usually does window matching or convolutions for neural methods which aggregate over a spatial region so each pixel depthdisparity depends on its neighbourhood and potentially globally depending on method this causes structured artifacts that are content dependent lidar takes a time of flight measurement for each pixel ignoring high order effects like crosstalk and scatter which are usually small each pixel ends up being effectively independently measured consequently the measurements look like they are corrupted by noise and are much less scene dependent,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQUM2M1VHVEdkeDFmRGpqVjJqZmVxT2J6d1FkcU9Sd0FDM0J4ckNld1FKbkRUVS00WFhZX0gxc0IwbTR2WVNXMTdUSXBSYW9uWFpwOXZhX0lEaUpoZWc9PQ==

the answer is likely that its because attention in every single layer of the network is hugely overparameterised and what the model benefits from is just parameters in general as long as you have a deep enough selfattention decoder youve likely enriched the representation of the kv token sufficiently what is important in these models is not whether you use attention specifically but it is whether or not you have a component in your model that can mix tokens together to create a more complete representation of the words thats why attention variants also work,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSmFsQTBRWTBvMm1nZWFLMnZIWGV1RVRTd1BiX0I3X0FkVHlLWXhYQ1ByZkRKSjRzbVVHN3BSaUxEcWxWU1Q1TVVuejNNLVJ1V0VEVEEtSkZPXy1UWXc9PQ==

my suggestion is to play with it a bit your choice of training data will actually be more important than the architecture at least in the beginning youre limited in parameters so you need to limit the scope at least in the beginning so something thats pretty homogenous like tinyshakespeare will let you see if something actually works then you can move up to tinystories then tinybooks etc youll build up an intuitive sense of how these different modifications effect performance and as you play with modifying the architecture youll see what symptoms arise when you experience common issues like breaking causality or exploding vanishing gradients with the model being so small you can even experiment with novel exotic stuff like using complex numbers or parallel attention etc etc the truth is big companies arent incentivized to really stray from the tried and true transformer but instead iterate and refine on it unfortunately those techniques dont work well at such small scales like m parameters so we need to test novel techniques to see what works,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlU3cwb3UxUXNhR3FtR0xqRmNZZnE5aTNHNTNVTzlBZVZNbENxRnVEMXpZNWM2a3lEVUY5a2JlQzVzYnpsTmhKSlNJbG9sRGJ6RXRqM3ZNMndvaHcyQ1E9PQ==
its entirely possible that your classes are so distinctly far apart from each other that by checking only one nearest neighbour it can tell what class the data point should belong to it really depends on the nature of your data in my experience ive never found k=<number> but then i have limited experience and you always learn something new,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleWFzSHh5RG5lcVl6cXh0LTVxNk9iUGNZTVZhNGNtUE5FSFR5M0RzZ2wtTkhsYVk5bXFkcGVRTU5oNmNOR2Vqbm1SVnBhLXJpazliUzdPUXEwUG9obFE9PQ==
you should have mentioned that your data is in turkish if that is the case you probably want to find an embedding model specifically trained on the turkish language openais embeddings are multilingual which likely wont be as good as a turkish specific model here are some that you might want to try <url> another thing is that when you do bm youre going to want to use some sort of word piece tokenization method since they are more robust to misspellings also with regards to the performance are you weighting each of the semantic and bm similarity scores before combining them this will help you tune the model and make it easier to adjust the results additionally you want to make sure that you have pretty rich descriptions so that the vectors in your embedding and bm space are well separated if youre working with a bunch of <number> word descriptions with lots of overlap between your items then your search will not be good no matter what you do its possible that your latency requirements and available hardware might not require any sort of ann methods you should test first before implementing them itll also depend on how the frontend is implemented and how quickly you expect your index to grow if you find that you need to go down this path then pinecone has a pretty comprehensive overview of how product quantization and inverse indices work <url> the gist of it is that product quantization greatly reduces the memory requirements of your index both by reducing the dimension of your vectors and their precision an inverted index is basically just a way to suggest candidates to search over instead of searching over the entire index every time in combination these will greatly speed up your search without much additional loss there is a library called faiss that could handle a lot of the implementation details for you but honestly i havent used it ive only done it from scratch finally if you need to be able to quantify the models performance it might be worth the time to make a validation set of queries and a ground truth nearest neighbor for easy comparisons you will be doing quite a bit of testing if you go for the ivfpq method,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlN3dNUnQ4Rmpwc0R4aHhCdnNyOE16bWNscW90MEYtTk1fQ05pMlpyM2t6SGhSbWhHbkdPOXlpWW9DR2hTbExUYWNYcm1FdkN3UG1TdnV1RnhOOWRJVGc9PQ==

yes but lambdas dont really have persistent memory so each call would load a new instance of the model technically i think amazon does do some caching of resources on the backend but you have no control over this if i remember right every <number> minutes or whenever auto scaling happens the lambda will shutdown and need to be cold started again ie the model will need to be reloaded,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleXVMUlBSVGNaekR3clZHMGh2U01rT0Vackx2S21RODZ5S2E2TndhdlF2U2x6Y2xqZFNuQ2VwMzUwcUlZQXVldlhDQ0VrNTk2aWpYb0c3dFY4TGJSS0E9PQ==
you are running into a data normalization problem to solve this first interpolate between your time series data use interpolation that adds no bias to the data linear dont use any smoothing as that will leak data once you have an interpolating function yt sample from that function at uniform time deltas use those new samples to train your predictor this should solve your non uniform time series problem,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlc29KN2t4WGhvSDJSRnk2R0xqMXdNbkJCYnBZejExRXQxTzdIOERSRThnZjlnanhkZ3VPdVl1UW5ZWDI5MEVMWGNYV1Z1MnVkcXZtOExEZEc0Z013MlVoZEtqQjVSMTFBdml1ZmlrWHJxX3c9

i think it makes sense to share embedding with softmax this makes it easy to copy tokens for example if you want a fair comparison i guess you should compare x bigger vocabulary + shared embeddingsoftmax vs x vocabulary + separate embedding and softmax so that the total capacity is the same in both cases probably somebody did already but i dont have a reference also sharing makes things slightly different from the point of view of the optimizer in shared case each token embedding always gets some nonzero gradient in nonshared case some of the input tokens will be very rare and may not appear in the batch even once and will get exactly zero gradient then if the optimizer does something clever like normalize gradients over one dimension or keep exponential moving average of past gradients or something like that these zeros could throw it off,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlR3ZPZi1ndFRwcEFRZDdDT3NSQlJqTU1CNHRaRjJRaG5KZXhya1VxVjUtdVFsaHBZQnBLYnBWZGc0bGNFVjQ5MmcySGlqNEZ0R3N0NWdWZGRvd25iOHc9PQ==

because safety makes the news but i m starting to think hallucination the inability to learn to reason correctly is a much bigger obstacle,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTXVWdlYwWFRsYXB3YXRYWnY5T3NWS05Oa2pKbzhGc0Vlb3BaTGJrSG0yajdXNElaV29MenRTVWVZSWQ2Wm0tdTZ5TVBEWW5OLXB5eUlyQjhUZmRjNkE9PQ==
it would be if hallucinations was also a feature not a bug of humans humans rarely on average say things that are wrong or illogical or out of touch with reality llms dont seem to learn that they seem to learn the structure and syntax of language but fail to deduce the constraints of the real world well and that is not a feature its a bug,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlcE13SVRDQ25TRlgtb1hkQXZ6b2NYZGpyUjlZZEhRT0NiR3dzQkRkbElLUk9QbjRSODBGMnl2X01uZGR6c1dlZjN2VW9KZ0o1d2ZacUtOV3VFcEp2bXc9PQ==
that llms can reason at all is a surprise these models are just trained to predict one more word in a series the fact that hallucination occurs is not an obstacle the fact that it occurs so infrequently that we can start devising solutions is remarkable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMGRmUXQ0WmNEd2g5bE1yZDJmeUF4MW92anJQemIybUpXWW9sSzU4b2ZpUXNYR2N5SHNtWmpHNDFidVFMLVR1NEstZVdFYTNmdnV4UjlPdHZNbEtYZkE9PQ==
> re just trained to predict one more word in a series trained to predict a distribution of thoughts our thoughts are mostly coherent and reasonable as well as syntactically well ordered hallucination occurs often it happens as soon as you ask some difficult question and not just everyday trivial stuff its still impossible to use llms to eg dive into scientific literature because of how inaccuarate they get and how much they confuse subjects i hope the solutions work because scaling up alone doesnt seem to solve the problem,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlT1p4OENpc1FlMGpxNjZNYzNPNU83VTVqd3ItSFY1RDNpTFdMc2RKaWJoZ2dPWGh5SmtQdWFBenBObmVHUnZsMlhzdThZRTJOMjRPR0RDcU1yWDZHT1E9PQ==

continued theres a lot of companies making hype a lot seeming to have selling dev or reference boards but instead producing a few thousands and distributing them via the usual mouser digikey element sparkfun etc they want you to fill out extensive forms to ensure youre a big player that will definitely eventually buy at least <number> units a day otherwise youre a waste of time for them to consider you even though going over every applicant individually is way more time consuming than just producing a couple thou and have digikey take care of selling <number> to <number> at a time thus ive come to the point that while google edge tpu is abandoned even though google is going full steam ahead on ai inference for their cellphones and tablets and coralai is seemingly doing nothing their tpus still provide the best <cur>tops in the range i want take a look at voxl<url> basically exactly what i want and would expect we should have had something like a google edge tpu v by now but a bit smaller and a little less power consumption yes i know moores law doesnt really apply anymore but in rapidly growing and learning fields like accelerated inference double the speed every <number> years is not unreasonable and it has been <number> years since the google tpu <number> tops per chip but the damn thing is over <cur><number> so my point finally is that even though google and coralai seem to have abandoned their tpu at about <cur><number> for <number> chips at <number> tops apiece for <number> tops total they still seem to be the best middle ground the next best might be the beaglebone reference studio for about <number> tops at <cur><number> same tops though on one chip for more than <number> times the cost the jetson orin nano by nvidia is <cur><number> for <number> tops at <cur><number>tops that a single google edge tpu will put out at <cur><number> including the board and stuff it seems everyone is abandoning the hobbyist edge inference space at lightning speed there are a lot of companies with promising size physical and performance products but they wont talk to you until you fill out a form that implies that they only want to talk to someone that has already decided to buy <number>s of your units whereas in the past companies would have devreference boards out trying to find someone that would develop that killer app and make them a lot of money why is this am i looking in the wrong place should i hoard google edge tpus i bought their usb version to tinker with and the grove ai vision kit now that i realize is only <number> gops so might be worthless what are my options for example a single quadcopter a <number> m above the ground looking things not image classic image classification where it can identify thousands of different objects it just needs to identify one type of thing doesnt even have to be very fast in fact dont these nns run on single images i could just buy multiple chips and run in parallel to get the framerate i want if it isnt fast enough it wont improve latency but <number> <number> ms latency probably isnt a problem until you get real close at which time you can switch to a different much cheaper solution that works even better at close range and wide fov maybe i can use a phone and get low level access to the nputpu and use that or use their powerful graphics cards on the phone or small laptop like a caveman from <number> still pretty expensive and i would be paying a ton of money for hardware i dont want maybe i could buy broken phones for parts on ebay but im not that hardware savvy i need a dev board to get me going the next best idea is to just push video from my dronerobotproject to a central station with a super powerful <number>u server inference accelerator not sure how i would get one or jetson orin computer with rtx and do inference there and just tolerate the latency that wont be feasible for some applications i would like to do though <number> i found a github repo that collects perf comparison projects and i checked their data and its extremely sparse one set is dominated by nvidia <number> ls ls and qualcomm t or something its a cloud only processor so you cant buy it then a few rows at the bottom have raspi <number> and like <number> other mini applications units and mcu chips and the results were hard to interpret especially since not all entrants have run all benchmarks and they can run it in probably dozens of different ways and then the results may not matter because their accuracy might have been bad tops right now is like whetstonedrystone or mips flops etc back in the day its a very rough estimate but it can get you in the ballpark so you can narrow down hundreds of options to <number> or so and then do more research from there if someone comes up with something better then for sure lets all use that or if we could get some standardized benchmarks i found some last night there were several and the results were very sparse not every entry ran all of the benchmarks in all the different ways it could one dataset was mostly a couple hundred rows nvidia <number> l l qualcomm ai <number> a cloud processor you cant buy and run it and then the last several rows where like a few raspi s and some other mpu boards with drastically lower scores every once in a while some announces a project to fix this but it hasnt helped at

it depends on details about the lidar sensor and stereo camera and especially for stereo the algorithms used but generally lidar is more accurate accuracy for classical stereo algorithms decreases quickly with distance at some point the disparity will be less than a pixelzero classical stereo algorithms also suffers in image regions with no texture or repetitive texture as well as dark and noisy images i say classical stereo algorithms because these issues can be mitigated with more modern learningbased algorithms but how do you train that algorithm one possibility would be lidar regardless stereo imagery binocular multiview or active using structured lighting imagery is definitely a rich source of depth supervision theres datasets using it out there stereo does have advantages for example it often can be provide higher density and may work better on some surfaces that reflect lidar in odd ways very dark surfaces shiny surfaces not to mention cost and portability,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMHBvU09CUEM2RHBRWmVaUG45UXB3aTNyNmRiVXg5dzFOZDVnRXFIRGFwVnhLSExwbEdObGFfNGo4RlVSbmo0ZFJCdjVzcHF2WU1teTNQZVFteXBaNmc9PQ==

take it with a grain of salt i am just a student currently but my understanding and observations are that llms are surprisingly good at explaining even things that are not well explained by quick google search and that is ability that likely rose from rlhf it built an intuitive understand of what a good explanation entails or other forms of text i in no way think llms are an answer to everything and try to be reserved with my hype for them as i did not find them particularly useful for my research use cases and have stuck with more traditional machine learning methods but the claim that humans rarely on average say things that are wrong or illogical or out of touch with reality llms dont seem to learn that seems incorrect to me i completely disagree with your statement that it might answer <number> bc if we were to display all the possible output tokens and their associated probabilities i believe it would have it way less likely as it has an internal representation of possibilities of each token and <number> bc is not often associated with queen elizabeth ii but thank you for the well thought out answer nonetheless,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQk5HNVNCQzZvY0lPYlZ3c29SWlJJMno0NFZaclB6eDVBaUJHNVFORXVJVDMwV0x4Sms2dDB4TlEyVHVNYW50MHJPcS1jZzY5WFVNdFlETU45NVZyWUE9PQ==

<number> is the proper way your system is built on a false assumption that data will always come in packets of <number> hours you can probably mess around with stuff and make it work well enough without fixing it but if you want to do it properly theres really no way around fixing the false assumption of course the issue will then be that <number> of the time your code will be running under one specific modality h so any potential issues that only arise when the inputs change in size could be hidden and pop up unexpectedly to bite you in the ass what you could do is for example to randomize the input size sometimes cutting it up in chunks possibly delaying or accelerating the lastfirst chunks and merging them with the adjacent days that kind of thing and check everythings fine you could leave it like that for production if performance isnt any worse or use it strictly during testing only or you could just check how the various hacky methods perform on historical data and if its good enough go with them im assuming this is for real work and not homework or research so you are most likely not going to get paid any more for writing the most logically sound robust and general code if it works it works,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVm8tWG5waGh6eExYZnJZdnNvaTNNQ2FSYmh6RWhZaTVsOWZ4OUJCcHVKT1ZINzhWMHB4UTBLOUIzSFdDcEgxRzJTRENiaWpLTWNfbzdCNFhCMzlSRGc9PQ==
the task seems weird and not having access to data is odd i agree with you that its not a great task that said i dont think your approach is plausible either even if you have somehow engineered sensible features without data you cannot fit a model personally i would instead tackle the problem that needs solving what data is useful here and how can it be gathered make a plan for that and have alternatives if some data is not available for technical or privacy reasons have a rough story on how that data can build a sensible model but make it clear that the idea is that the data will tell you which features and combinations of features are good predictors and which arent,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTmdFbnlWVHhhT25pUW5rU3RPeVFKb05tdWdOdXJiV0c2azlQbWZqSUFFOE5YanRTRWNsSndrSWFZd3kwczQ4clZWMktVaWtCbW1fOHhfTkw1SGYxbHc9PQ==

which is weird to me because in practice hallucinations are much more harmful as they plant false information in our society everybody who used current llms for a little bit knows they are not intelligent enough to be an extinction level risk as an autonomous agent but hallucinations on the other hand are doing real harm now and they prevent them from being used in so many real world applications also saying this is not solvable and it needs to be accepted is stupid and non productive without hard proof i heard the same point in the past from people telling me that next token prediction can not produce good chat bots the time when gpt was just released the examples were that you could ask them how their grandmother likes their coffee and they would answer like most humans would yet currently chat bots are so aligned with their role that it is pretty hard to break them in this regard solving hallucinations will be hard and they might be fundamental to the approach but stating they are fundamental to next token prediction makes no sense to me as other flaws of raw next token prediction have been solved to some extent eg by training with a different method after the pretraining also you can disregard most auto regressive text generation as next token prediction even if its not that simple see rlhf for example you can probably build systems that are encouraged to predict the tokens i dont know in cases where they would hallucinate but the question is how you encourage the model to do so in the correct situations which is seems not possible with vanilla next token prediction alone i am not the biggest fan of closedai but i was really impressed how little gpto hallucinates as anacdotal evidence i asked it a bunch of questions regarding my universities robotics team which is quite a niche topic and it got nearly everything right way better as eg bing with web rag and if it didnt knew something it said so and guided me to the correct resources where i would find it gpt <number> <number> and all open llms where really bad at this inventing new competitions team members robot types all the time,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRFhTTmVGSjZ5S1hsemNsOTF4am8wZmEyaG45WnRBTVhURDdPRWJoWnQwdGs4cWhqQ3ZYRmxkTEM1MjZ0VUE5bWZJa2tVTjQzYlRNbzJwVnRjQl9HeHc9PQ==

that implies humans hallucinating will always be an issue too which its not no one confidently produces random information that sounds right if they dont know the answer to a questionto the best of their knowledge they tell you they dont know or if pressed for an answer they qualify statements with im not sure but i think either way humans dont hallucinate and we have just as much flexibility,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlU0FXVmlvNUQ3dnBHSzF6VF9aMklsdmpyRUlKNl9XZko2ZkE0dVRQaUY0ZlVrUmVwY09rZEE2ME5PY1R5aGd2N1I5RTN5RnNnUWRiUXBwbTN3OTJ1ckJWQjhSLTN1TDBiZm1PdDUtVWJfWGs9

only work towards models that you have some kind of plan for how they will be operationalized figuring out what data is available to you in an operational context is the first step here not the last if you dont have real user interactions to feed the model it cant be operationalized anyway its one thing if you cant get access to the real data because of sensitivity issues and so youre forced to work with fake data its a whole other issue if not only you cant get access to real data but you cant even get a description of the fields that would potentially be available to the model in production either you or your manager need to figure out what engineering teams own the platforms upon which the kinds of interactions you are interested in occur and work with those teams to figure out what kind of data is currently available and what kind of data they might be able to collect that would be useful to you which they arent already collecting,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVEVwQlJUbFV6cFlZR0dxNlV1enNQd1lFSFB1dkxIV3RKc3FvNk1kR0VzQzFBQXFDaDNFMGEyOHhKRHpOU1pQREd2OHU0a195TXJmNWNTbVFCS2RWQ2c9PQ==

you still have to validate the data as the models dont have a way to explain their output its just a breakdown of token probability according to whatever tuning the parameters have it isnt producing the output through reason and therefore cant cite sources or validate whether a piece of information is correct or incorrect as advanced as llms get they have a massive hurdle of being able to comprehend information in the way that we are comprehending it they are still completely blind to the meaning of the output and we are not any closer to addressing that because its a fundamental issue with what the program is being asked to do,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMG85MmI0ZGZFVU9SSnA5cmRCd21idzZDSl94N1V4d1htYVl2bVBNMWtucTI3R1ZfYzE3OXMwS1I4bHQ2MlBzSG5hNHdvX3ZWM1lJT2FXbV9tWmEydFE9PQ==
thats not true humans can parse what makes a statement incorrect or not token generation is based on probability from a dataset combined with the tuning of parameters to get an output that mimics correct data as the llm cannot interpret the meaning of the output it has no way to intrinsically decipher the extent to which a statement is true or false nor would it have any notion of awareness that a piece of information could determine the validity of another youd need a piece of software that understands what it means to cite sources before you could excuse the occasional brainfart,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleXdfdlUzV045eHhSMU0zTWtuX3paTDh3S0ZYT3NBTkVMQWdsSXlabUd0VlpxR3FMTlJlUklic3B2UjJmOENPdXBuVV9qVGt1QUJNOGNLZExpRV9uV0E9PQ==
what do you think it is large language models and deep learning models in general would be deterministic without adding a random constant i think they call it lambda you can either define hallucination as that planned randomness when choosing the next token or you can define hallucination as the resulting effect namely that the cumulative randomness can lead to the models predicted sentence straying completely off or just being factually wrong,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlekFPdlJteW1MOTFoUVI1dGFhMTVaeWlwckJpdFBHb2RDRDgxTnQ2bEFJbkRHYTRyVHlGNnViVjdVaUU1TENJWlNvbXdzWEdxaUFRRHBUSDhJT2w2Vnc9PQ==

i would strongly disagree that rag alone is the solution for hallucinations yet alone safety in general it is useful or even necessary for many applications beyond simple demos but it is still inherently prone to it current models still hallucinate even if you provide them with most relevant information the model sometimes just decides that it needs to add a paragraph with nonsense information and constraining the model too hard in this regard is not helpful either as it limits the models overall capabilities changes to the training objective itself as well as rewarding the models capability to self evaluate its area of knowledge build internal representations for that seem more reasonable to me the ideal case would be a relatively small model with excellent reasoning and instruction capabilities but not a lot of factual knowledge maybe some general common knowledge but nothing too domain specific then slap rag with large amounts of documentationexamplesweb and you should get a pretty decent ai system the tricky part seems to be the small nonhallucinating instruction model that is not bloated with factual knowledge,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlem55RUtfdVkyQkxHTERRZFlMUy11LWJvLVZmcExNcHF6V2RmTXlFcWwtNXVBemdFMUxKdHlfNXBxVVpuV0ZZNDROWE1kT2lnSllvSG1rLTZXTUMwZmc9PQ==
they do not contain the ability to do that the way hallucinations work bears that out its a core problem with the software there is nothing else going into llms other than training data sets and instructions for output if you mess with the parameters youll get nonsense outputs because its just generating tokens it cant see the english language this isnt totally a drawback for what its worth i think creative writing is a benefit of llms and using them to help with writers block or to create a few iterations of a text template is a wonderful idea but its just for fun hobbies and side projects where a human validates edits and oversees anyway the inability to reason leaves it woefully illequipped for the tasks marketers ceos are desperate to push it into very basic google searches replacing jobs medical advice etc,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlN09ScGZWZnhoUm82UjkwWm1yN2d5bWNqc1l1QkhpbTN4NmRydmQzWW45QVVCN3JzY3pORmdjS1ZZRUFBcEUxekI4ZUF6MThxam0xSWZ0a2UyVk5ISmc9PQ==

the axioms of a nerual networks are the axioms of arithmetic and linear algebra you get some input which is first tokenized and mapped to high dimensional vectors in most llms the steps are repeated applications of normalization matrix multiplication application of a nonlinear function and gating of the information that passes through the attention layers these operations can implement all arithmetic operations and perform conditional computation ie if=else statements given that these networks are stacks of layers with the same internal architecture where the dimensionality of input and output dont change they can implement for loops limited by the number of layersblocks in the forward pass the way they process information follows logical steps its just that it is not directly mappable to human language or do you imply that all reasoning even human reasoning has to be decodable as sentences in human language,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlN09ONWswOTJvZE1SNVp4bDFxY2p4LVBOWm5jZ20teklBUXEtdTJudDN3NzFzS1A5OGttU0REbkhMMC1ueUN5NFlyM0lQczJFaDRrVWVGZE9BMjdsSlZSWmVOWDA4b20tZlRmYldDRlhuUVU9

why so llms learn a world model via diverse natural language text representations they can learn it well forming a coherent world model which will output incorrect hallucinated statements very rarely or they can learn it poorly forming an inadequate world model and outputting things based on this inadequate world model that dont reflect reality this continuum of world model quality is quite evident if we compare llms of different capabilities the more powerful llms hallucinate less than weaker ones there are some complications like arrow of timerelated issues the world isnt static and proper contextualization on top of good world model but they wont invalidate the whole premise imo,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUUtneXZ5RTZqUlQ3M2JENW85aUI2WlMyQWFDckY5bUhmQXBFUEI5YnFoNEZlTlozVEROM2tYd2V3OTdMNWIyRGNvRDRIQUs5eFNXd2hCUW8zUmpuU3NUdUVuSVBCVlpCUlFJQWR1LTIzWDg9

i dont like that point of view even if you think hallucinations can be useful in some context surely you want them to be controllable at least otoh if you think hallucinations are an unavoidable consequence of llms then you are probably just factually wrong and if you somehow were proven to be correct that would still not make them a feature it would just prove that the current architectures are insufficient,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMVZZanFfcVNzSUxEUXhDaWVQV3FCekViOGpDLXlLbFFHV2NsdGJyaWQ0ak1BZENiUnFhV3JNSEwwckhvcThmRUkzU01uQ2FhNzlIaVlWSXRsRXozbkE9PQ==

some of the outputs may look similar but it is vital to understand that the llm does not have the same motives as a human nor the same processing nor the same inputs llms only are considered ai because they look to us like they are intelligent if anything they are step backwards from the approaches of the last <number> years of simulating intelligence and i mean that in that it doesnt build context from the ground up try to simulate reasoning in another layer and then process something in nlp on the way out i was working on these systems in the s in my thesis and early work they might be a lick of paint that looks like sort of human conversational or generative intelligence or they might be something deeper we dont even know yet were still working out the models trying to look inside the black box of how it builds its own context relationships representations and so forth we just dont know,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlM0t6SVVoeWtUZUZlci1jYS1FOUFFcFhGWlQwWW5lcjM3bHVYT0xRRzRCOWRJYjM1NVJkOWo4T1JHQ240WmU0Wk1ZcG5acHNBcy02MG82U2RhcXY1b3c9PQ==

this doesnt make much sense to me clearly hallucinations are a bug they are unintended outputs llms are attempting to predict the most probable next token and a hallucination occurs when it incorrectly assigns high probability to a sequence of tokens that should have been very low probability in other words hallucinations occur due to incorrect predictions that have a high error relative to the target distribution that is the opposite of a feature for predictive ml models the purpose of predictive ml models is to reduce their erroneous predictions and so calling those higherror predictions a feature doesnt make much sense,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlR1d0TlVfcEhyWUkyNXF1WnF3YnBPc0ZlMDRRSXdydGFDYnRJeGphbG9XSlJPeF9zTnZpaXV5SGdDVmZCc0EwekdIOEdFS0hRU1RELU5nX0FUamlFNFE9PQ==
a decoderonly llm does two things it refines the understanding of the input token by enriching it with context it predicts the next token notice that if an embedding at position n simply contains a prediction of token n+<number> it is obviously better to attend to the token n+<number> directly theres no point in looking at the nth prediction of the n+<number>th token that prediction doesnt know how the sampler ended up choosing so it has strictly less info so it makes sense to try to separate out these two calculations and spend more time attending the first one i believe the idea is that instead of mixing the two together as in decoderonly a decoderdecoder may manage to disentangle the two and put them where they belong,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbU1mOHdIOFBNNDRkMkZjd0diYllZajJwS1BWYVZ2azU3R2MxWUdtUkN4SFNvcS1oQllJbXp6OHJwRS1ZY2JSX2d4ZHAwanRJZ2plc2U1RkxuVHZUY2dwLUV1RVdWVUtxdXc3TGJxSnhzaEk9

this reminds me of those systems that combine proof assistants with large language models in order to generate theorems a distinctive element of a large language model is that it is creative which if you are able to accompany it with other measures that restrict it to verifiable data may produce outcomes that you otherwise wouldnt be able to access we dont want it only to reproduce existing statements made by humans but statements consistent with our language but not previously said you just need something else to catch references to reality and check them,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWV9NcG14Si1UQ2lIbFlETVJHVzI4T2FiTkhmV0xUZUxvdlo0S2FIR0ZZaG1iM1UxVUZrVUw5Tkt2TGtWem96OGtxQ0xSby1Pd3NIUWx0RS12VjJ2dUlDZV9EVU9Rc1VFdWdjX1RGcDA0U3c9

ive noticed people use hallucination in two ways when talking about llms one definition describes how the model creates information that isnt based on reality or just makes things up the other definition is whats used here that refers to the basic process of generating any response by the model it seems like whenever hallucination is mentioned the top comment often ends up arguing about these semantics,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUDFSSUFvRklOdmlrNmtxcmRwOHFFaTVkNHFVdmt1Z040TWppVDk0Mm5KV2MzcHVjUTljMjU1OVNZLUc3c2QwRXNPVzBnbk53b1Brcm5BT2JJb0ZxQnc9PQ==

all llms do is hallucinate as in the mechanism of text generation is the same regardless of the veracity of the generated text we determine if we regard an output as a hallucination or not but the llms never have any clue while its generating text ive been working on countering hallucinations in my job mostly because thats what customers care about and the best methods are ultimately improving dataset quality in terms of accurate content if you are finetuning and ensuring that the proper context is provided during rag situations in the case of rag it boils down to making sure you have good retrieval which is not easy each llm behaves differently with context too and the order of the retrieved context for example with llama you likely want your best context to be near the end of the prompt but with openai it doesnt matter postgeneration hallucination fixing techniques dont always work well and can sometimes lead to hallucinations in of themselves,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVGxad3h2ZEhPZ0JUOUtTeHhhb0oxeDNsM1REaEpIUFE1czR0aldFNjVFM3lzX2dLNUYwQ09fSkZxRzlOOGsycmczQWdYMklVVzd3ZFZ5LVZzQ0dsOVE9PQ==

my advice is a bit tangential but problem first solution second dont go into this thinking im gonna use ai define your problem look at all the previous work and tools available and select the best one i know its tempting to just do ai to be novel but if you think about actually adding value youre gonna have a better time down the line that being said hard to answer without more details about your problem > information from the vertical and horizontal directions obtained separately and with different resolutions not sure i understand are they already both d ie its an alignment and fusion problem or is it d data and you have to generateextrapolate d data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlOGJVRlkzYjhuSXpGd3o0a3FjZGlzbGVKbkpITkpORUU2Y1dFSnFWVDhXOFpBTUV4cEpNSHVpTTltNThPTXYtc2tBNS1PWXkweEhybXlBLUVZMDgwWHc9PQ==

how do you ensure that the datasets that you are testing on are not part of the original training data used for these foundation models it seems highly likely that a large model trained on billions of examples could contain some of these test cases and would put these foundation models on an unfair advantage compared to the priorfree models edit some of the models even explicitly use the testing examples you provide for training for example wikipedia page views is a common one this seems like its measuring over fitting more than anything else why not create some artificial time series based on dynamical systems which could not possible have existed before,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlY2lSWkhoak5NaC12UV9OVnM1bElJeUJsN2hJbWJLa2kxLTB4aHR3OVNMWjlCTlZwWHNJOW1WY3JvNzZoelREVGk4TnY1dUc3OGFzT2pLOHo2bm9UNnh4bDduUGdveXlBQXQ1SGh2TWZQNDQ9

cristian from nixtla here thanks for sharing your concern we discuss this in the repository with the reproducible experiments <url> based on the description of the training data from the papers this is primarily an issue only for timesfm for timegpt in particular none of the series were observed by the model during training so the current results benefit other foundation models note also that this is the first iteration of the experiment we plan to increase the number of series and models in the future the main reason for using real data is to evaluate the models on realworld applications synthetic data requires making many assumptions which might not represent realworld data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleVNHMnRmTkxTMUZod3daQ3lIMU5DV0FkaG5Nandpemw0aHZHTkl6OFByYnRyMkIwOUdJa1F5cFlTUXRzT1NmNTgwSVB5V2dDNzdjN0szbXB6eEdPYlE9PQ==

yup its done by converting things into loglikelihood before converting them back which gives a curve thats more friendly to differentials using the gumbels trick which is the basis of the softmax is also a way if you have a logprobability generating network you can create a sample from the output map its useful sometimes because logspace can be much easier to work with especially with ml models since its easier to get them to learn how to predict logprobabilities instead of continuous space ones,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbHBjYmJIRTRkT3hwSEpvSjFSb1lfNkNwY2MtVkZYVTd6Z2xPUUU2cVNwdmQ0STF6VDhTWHZpaGo5eWNuUV9WU3NKbEZuSTJpYjk5OXE5NFNyZ3J4c1E9PQ==

if youre using latent diffusion then can treat the autoencoder as a noisy channel and calculate ratedistortion as per usual to calculate the coding rate you need the distribution of the data and you can get that by calculating the determinant of the jacobian of the process that goes input > latent encoding > diffusion noise distribution ie run the diffusion process to get the noise sample from the latent data sample the probability density of the sample can be calculated using the jacobian determinant and the probability density of the noise sample that you calculated,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldGZicGxYdXpYVjRaVXNGd3RGWnd5U2M5VUpkV3BBSnZFbGE2bE52dW5oYzNDdVhjMlJZZ25ocjR1dTRSLTdDSHp3ZUR5VTkzNTJSUXZ3VGFlWjFjRVE9PQ==

>youre assuming that true statements should consist of a sequence of tokens with high probability no im not assuming that i think we might have different definitions of hallucination one thing that i think you are ignoring is that llms are conditional on the author of the text and the context so imagine a mathematician writing an explanation of some theorem they are very familiar with for an important lecture that person is unlikely to hallucinate and make up random nonsensical things about that theorem however imagine if another person was writing that same explanation such as a young child they might make up gibberish about the topic etc in my opinion a hallucination is when the llm predict high probability to token sequences that should actually be low probability if it were being authored by the person context that its predicting for it has nothing to do with truth or rightwrong its about the errors of the models predictions hallucinations are incorrect because they output things that the specific human wouldnt llms are intended to be conditional on the author and context,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlcFN4WUFXQk04MHFyTkNRVGhyNUs3NlQ5c1pfRVYteTRmVU13Sk5VczNWb0cwVmxib0RBUjNHMXVscXNKQnIwT0NlcEI5dk1pMkF3YVlpMVlWb1dtSHc9PQ==

yes and no when an llm invents a new reference that doesnt exist then this shouldnt be the most likely tokens the reason for hallucination is the lack of proper information knowledge which could be due to a lack of understanding or simply because the necessary information wasnt even in the dataset therfore hallucination could be fixed by having better datasets or by learning to say i dont know more reliably the latter shouls be totally possible as the model knows the confidences of the next tokens i dont where the impression comes from that this was an unsolvable problem,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRDdVbF84QV9IdnJXcUhhd0F4RFoyalh5LUxxaEtWYlp0UGJXWkZUNW5tOWZBUHRQVW51WmhGWFFTcDBFWU5fTjVMcTd3RGxwbWdWMVg3aFc1b2s4dEE9PQ==

this is a basic recommendation problem made complicated because youre probably looking up a bunch of text embedding keywords like you mentioned below you could use a two tower approach for this where each entity type has a nn that takes in features and produces an embedding the user tower would take in a bag of books and any other user features and produce a user embedding the movie tower would take in any movie features you might have or could just be a lookup of a movie embedding in which case its equivalent to a standard multi label or multi class mlp you train it by predicting your labelled liked movies by taking the dot product between the two embeddings and then either sigmoid or softmax with unliked potentially sampled movies as negatives,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleWpGV2xvYXJOd0p0WkYyaExnVUx1QjlnYWFBOHlCVmt4T2thX2JXU2VYYVlDd092cHpwTHI0Umd5UlphY0Q2UUExLUVxN0NDM1FzdGJZTVlRZzhWUDQ4Xzg0czZTZlBDN2NaYkYyVDYxUGs9

this is a very complex question perhaps someone can give a more expansive answer than i can hallucination can make something new or unexpected sure it may even seem insightful by coincidence but it has no direction it is the llm flailing around to respond because it has to respond being creative and inventive is directional purposeful it is also in most cases logical and progressive and adds something new to what already exists,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlajhhQ1VZMnhPZjdsdXpSeURCci1acHZkOHlGY29aOHV5U0pXRVRXdGpRMDRQTGNxTmZPWHB0dHR2ai1XdU5UQV9qcGJRcThjOF9EaU9WQWpRUzVVeFE9PQ==

thank you for your reply you say on that page > we guaranteed that all the timestamps for all the time series were completely unseen to timegpt<number> during training do you have the same separation timestamp across all tasks if not then datasets where the training split ends at different real times can still inform each other about their respective futures although not direct it does leak some information about the testing split for individual tasks additionally you confirm that you separate traintest based on timestep do you also have a tasklevel separation is there a subset of the results which are only on tasks which are guaranteed to not be in the training dataset this i think is the critical selling point because any personal applications of foundation models will be on private datasets and tasks which could not have possibly been trained on its important to test this shift whether through simulated data or holdout tasks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlLXAtdjhYX1V3bEQwUWJrVVRnbHRjM1dFNHBhRHlGQ040bE11OGxQdnl4TEQ4SC12aG9iZ1F3Z1d2YzRwTkNGOW53WTQ0aF9PSGhzNmhrdlhtcEI5ZERzNWlpRGtQVUlSU1U1LTB1dmZ6ZDg9

yes thats the main benefit from pretraining but in a timeseries context overfitting on correlations between observations is more problematic in that it inherently leads to exploiting ex post information which defeats the purpose of forecasting in the first place what can be done in this situation to address the problem is to do a simple rolling estimation eg train the model on data from <number><number> and then test the model using timeseries data from <number> i may be mistaken but i think these pretrained models use data from timeperiods that overlap with the timeseries data from the test set to give an example if i fit some timeseries model on a bunch of stock returns like meta amzn aapl from <number><number> it is inappropriate to test on aapl returns from <number><number> in fact most timeseries variation in stock returns comes from exposure to common market factor which means that a model that would have over fit on the train data meta amzn aapl <number><number> would likely do implausibly well on the inappropriate test data aapl <number><number> the same point holds for most general timeseries data sets they often lie on a lower dimensional space so overfitting on that space the source of crosssectional correlations would be problematic a better solution here is to test on aapl <number> onwards to avoid this lookahead bias the same thing should be done with the experiments above out of curiosity i checked the performance of a portfolio based on timesfm standard weak efficient markets hypothesis says we shouldnt be able to predict future returns with past returns common sense says that hedge funds should have arbitraged this idea out already trying to do this shouldnt make a lot of money methodology use historical monthly returns for each stock to forecast the next month return using timesfm context window = <number> sort stocks into deciles by the forecast value compute average returns within each decile portfolio compute portfolio performance on longshort portfolio the high decile minus the low decile portfolio the underlying portfolio leverage is thus fixed to <number> standard academic finance operating procedure shared the notebook here <url> the stock returns are proprietary data from <url> so i wont share that results the return on the timesfm portfolio is <number> per year the annualized sharpe is <number> also the cumulative return plot<url> looks practically like a straight line there is no performance degradation which is quite suspicious for a portfolio this does not seem realistic because the only inputs to timesfm are the past monthly returns too simple of a predictor to get performance like this for this reason i think the lookahead bias of these pretrained models may be nontrivial,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlUG81eWZwbzlkTEVNSzVCYnk1UnpUa3hqOHdTSTk0S1gtTzR6ZTlpMV9Jem91TVU2RzBOZXNlVmZrRGtNdHVIblBrZ1d6TkhoUVUxTUotRVpxSFN2SGc9PQ==

you have everything you need to do contrastivetriplet learning this solves your need for a learned embedding space instead of simply treating the whole json as text you can separate out the structured values like genre and price from the unstructured stuff like descriptions and titles one hot encode the categorical values leave the numeric stuff as is and then simply concatenate everything with your embedded unstructured data youll also want to do some normalization so that your structured values are not overrepresented in your distance calculations additionally since im assuming the movie and book embeddings will be in two different spaces you will want to learn a projection to put them into a shared space from here you might also want to consider a metric that is a weighted sum of another metric measured over subsets of each of the dimensions of your embedding space ie specialmetrica b = <number>metrica<number><number> b<number><number> + <number>metrica<number><number> b<number><number> + <number>metrica<number><number> b<number><number> you can learn the weights for such a metric using the exact same technique as you used for learning the embedding and projection layers you will probably want to learn the metric after learning and freezing the embedding though,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVnhnTWFhUG1JUlo1dFV0VEpsYTBxU1BQY0paVFBVekFTWmNCQzhyWDl6WTJaNG1lQ0NxVlNiT2tnUm1fTjBQWlRjSU00ZTQwQzFmUjAyVHhadEVQUnc9PQ==

the reason its not solvable is because the hallucinated non existent court case that it cited is as far as language modeling goes fundamentally the same thing as the llm producing any other sentence that isnt cut and pasted from its training data ill be using a hypothetical ai lawyer as an example application of ai a hallucinated non existent court case is a perfectly valid output for a model of language that you do not want your lawyer to cite a non existent court case is because you want a lawyer and not a language model to do your court filings simple as that now if someone up sells an llm as an ai lawyer thats when hallucinations become a bug because they want to convince their customers that this is something that is easy to fix and not something that requires a different approach to the problem than language modeling humans by the way are very bad at predicting next tokens even old language models have utterly superhuman performance on that task edit another way to put it even the idealized perfect model that is simulating the entire multiverse to model legalese will make up non existent court cases the thing that wont cite non existent court cases is an actual artificial intelligence which has a goal of winning the lawsuit and which can simulate the effect of making up a non existent court case vs the effect of searching the real database and finding a real court case a machine that outputs next tokens like a chess engine making moves simulating the court and picking what tokens would win the case that is a completely different machine from a machine that is trained on a lot of legalese theres no commonality between those two machines other than most superficial,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVTRUVVpJczNfYkFnTkwydkQ3U19oTUZPTkViLTI1eGZFb2doeTBuVHVLVlhyZmhOTENOb2tXSUJXM1JJMktUWi1ycWI4NUJkQWJFYzFMdk5td3J3X2c9PQ==

precisely this on top of it llms do not have much in common with typical scifi ai which is most decidedly not an llm for example if a scifi ai is working as a lawyer it got a goal to win the case its modeling court reactions to its outputs and it is picking the best tokens to output which of course has completely different risk profile the ai takes over the government and changes the law to win the court case or perhaps brainwashes the jury into believing that the defendant is the second coming of jesus what ever makes for the better plot an llm on the other hand merely outputs most probable next tokens fundamentally without any regard for winning the court case,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmdmlCYlNRZGFncFZ5Q3Q4Q21wVlc5NnpId1FUTUNyX0I1R1Z1dC1IMkdOWHQ5T2k5OHhmZXhOTU9Zdm8tdVRjUEJmOFhvVUU0YVJOel9nX1owdkdwX3c9PQ==

i managed to compress efficientnetb down to a much smaller size while retaining a good portion of the accuracy the tflite model is x in image size with <number> outputs with <number> and a size of k parameters my testing to date shows its a decent model i would have expected the test data to have low accuracy as well otherwise given i kept it clean and away from training i guess my question is primarily is there something noticeably wrong with my results to date i have yet to receive anyone even suggesting its beneficial i didnt expect tons of interest but given tinyml is such an untapped field i thought id have some interest at all starting to believe im missing something fundamental that folks are seeing and just politely not telling me about i dont know i dont have a traditional background in machine learning im a programmer so i dont have the network i could reach to for additional feedback and i know i am still in many ways a novice i detailed the process here <url><url> the first notebook in the series my site has all of them <url><url> <url><url> by the end i converted the model to relu as int quantization caused too heavy of a drop in accuracy as noted by the efficientnetlite folks for their rationale for ditching swish there sorry if this is a distraction,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmRWdKbm1oT0NSWThqSE4wV0xUendHdUJfb0RiSVFTTWlVVDlvX0VQM29WTHVrU2hZMHpuTktVUnFyeUxwM1Nfcl9nam9lQXRYaGJkVXhxX2ZqNjUyYmc9PQ==

idk if this really makes much sense but might you try something like sindy out of steve bruntons lab their approach is tailored towards physicsinformed problems but seems like it could work here they generate a whole bunch of candidate terms the library or dictionary that involve simple combinations of inputs like to fit the lorenz attractor or something they have x y z and then they add xx xy xz zz and maybe some derivatives and stuff then they try to figure out which combinations of dictionary terms fit the data the most accurately seems like a potential good way to find these simple formulas though you have to be able to generate good candidate terms for you dictionary in some automated way,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVXFCWTVXSEVMeXZzQzRJUWhNOGl0R0JuMXBOXzgtVHBURDdUUHNCRlNLMllwZWNxaHFJTmoyTmFaaEl4allMZ3lDRGdleHRNZkpIN3k1TmhBcWw1Znc9PQ==

that is a freaking great point you wont catch my ass making incredibly unreliable premonitions about decoderonly models again i have put myself in the doghouse and anything i do share is a reference to somebody that wasnt dead freaking wrong although i still maintain that encodermodels are vastly underutilized for instance people attempt all sorts of reinvented workarounds to the fact that decoderonly models strongly avoid for damn good reasons returning a yes or no to prompts or even dividing choices into having it select between letter choices from a through f even if you can convince the model to limit itself to like <number> tokens my experiences are that it starts failing badly at questions it otherwise got right to train an encoder model to identify which choice through pytorch and make the llm response just a part of the pipeline it extracts the answer from would prove very useful i think,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmQmtyRU1qWmxNallZWHVndWJ0eUEzZDI5VTJOUTBQaDk4MGpFU0cydFQtaUV5cUs5a3VKemV6X1o4bkx1OGVqd19UNzN0ZVRWeXVTSWdsblRtZmlKeFE9PQ==

thank you for your reply sorry i took a long time to answer you i totally get your point and definitely i agree with you i was thinking about ai for <number> main reasons <number> i really really want to restart doing that kind of programming and analysis i loved it a lot during my master and i wish i could use the tools i studied to apply it to physics <number> nobody in my lab does this stuff so it would be my project with all the related advantages <number> analysing the framework i truly think ai is a feasible and interesting path to take i would be focusing on an experiment that is not in function yet which would mean working with synthetic data at first but i could train my network on similar machines and this could also lead to international collaborations you see the deal anyway concerning the data i will be working with a sort of particle accelerator the diagnostics installed will get me tomography images very low resolution and both vertical and horizontal profiles of heat loads with even worse resolution lol so its d pictures that give me different information i need to combine to produce a better resolved pic in the end hope this is more clear sorry i wrote it in a rush and thanks again for your time,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJma3ZIR1cxVGtvNUpBN1dESVpOZXBWUkszTnJCX0x3SDV4Z0tQT1g4U0JoNUhCaC1SaGFVY0ZMQ2ZhQmlua1d1Q3JXSS0tQUJFS1B3VklHd1lyZGhFcGc9PQ==

accumulate cooccurrence statistics between all entities a and b to form a pointwise mutual information matrix use svd or implement a gradient descent matrix factorization on gpu to factorize it and you will get embeddings of all entities in a and b and their dot products will precisely approximate cooccurrence this is the same technique that trains original word embeddings on raw text data but it can be applied to any data where you treat a and b as discrete and not symmetric entities eg a=job titles b=skills coocurrence statistics is gathered from cvs job postings and then you factorize and you have the basis of an embeddingbased a hr recommender system this always works provided you have enough samples <url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmZU83UDQ5cmpzSGFuZWNWRXZEczhzQmNNaUVDOTFHQWFPNDBnam5hNHRYbzJoaTFkNFBLeTBwaDU1YVRTcE9Na2RHX2tWalBaMDJpUEp3eDRUYWNWN2c9PQ==

edit what you describe is not hallucination but just a wrong prediction the model outputs would be deterministic to an input of course if the predicted raw next token probabilities lead the model down a wrong path that still results in a wrong answer however this would then be due to training limitations the dataset not containing the necessary information or the stochasticity that is inherent to training i would not call that hallucination because for these reasons any type of model can give a wrong answer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmUE1kMVR3UzE2X0VZNFdTTkxxV2VvaWVaRDItVjhtdjhXWFpIRU9zWVk3YkxPSElnR0ZDYl90ZlhPUmZXU0xxMFNtTHNxcVNFQVpoX1QwNWpGaFNPVnc9PQ==

its actually an incredible explanation and the only one that truly explains it well the core idea and its not something that ive ever thought about is that the dot product of two random vectors is zero this is what is implied when you say the intuition for this is that randomly chosen vectors in high dimensions are almost always approximately orthogonal i honestly wouldve thought that when you initialize a new neural network the attention matrix is random but its not when you initialize a new neural network the attention matrix starts out as all numbers being almost zero after softmax that gives you random probability distribution though but attentionbeforesoftmax being all zero means its easy for the neural network to quickly learn associations and make particular attention values very large relative to the rest which are all tiny close to zero so the point is if you take qxky and insert positional embeddings to get qx+eky+f you can do some math to rearrange that to x qky + x qkf + e qky + e qk f note how x qky is position agnostic but the other three terms just relate a token to its position or the last term which is the positionposition the important magic is all four of those terms end up being initialized to essentially allzero matrices at the beginning of training therefore the backprop can easily learn to make x qky whatever it wants and unless it intentionally wants to learn to make x qkf nonzero then the x qkf matrix wont contribute much anyway yes the random x qkf will add some random noise but the random noise is small and if the positional embeddings are truly worthless the nn can choose to dedicate a dimension by learning to make the word embeddings orthogonal to the positional embeddings that way the x qkf matrix goes to zero ditto for e qky and e qk f,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmMGJYQjFsN2VJS1pKM3prNHd2SXAwWm9jZWUzb1VJNEt6NThXaFpsV21acnJJMU1PZHgwb1JqZnlIeTFkZEtWdHgxMnoycXM3aF9ydWdNWWxhWWstWWc9PQ==

its cute because experimentally theres almost always some transformer t somewhere in the network that just learns to make the attention <number> for the previous token and <number> for all other tokens that means that t learned to make e qk f equal to <number> when e f implies that y is <number> token before x and t learned to make the other three terms <number>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmX2E1YUl6RUpKME9yak9OSW96MEVHR1JxWFZCQk1HT2VmNFQ1QkpiYWhac3AzRUl1Nl80SEdEdXhRR2EwTlVMZnlHSWhSU1Z6X2lqdHE1a2JpQW1zTkE9PQ==

there are many many approaches to this classic recommendation system use matric factorisation something like als alternating least squares is simple to understand and can scale quite well to millions of users items using spark als wont scale to new users or items so something like two tower neural network to predict like vs dislike is more extendable gnns on a bipartite graph is the most general solution you can train the model to solve for link prediction where every link is liking or not liking this model is much more complex and harder to scale but imo should generalize the best and should overall have the best results,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmekNJcWRLYUhwMnJUdnA2V3NlUmZXTUcxRENJelI4Y2VNWjVoVU9VUmFNSnN6ejZPRGV1eTBIN3dCVzQzajU2QWZscnNRZDJaS2hxUUctMjhWenRWVmFTSThzUEFsaE0yaVhFVTV5ZXNINUE9
hi i dont know of such a repository but i have been trying to constitute a timeline of how the models evolved as a way to educate myself its part hobby and part education but i try to implement from scratch the models well using pytorch and i write on a blog about them how did the architecture change and why etc it goes beyond the architecture i try to find information about the training and optimizers etc its not exactly what youre asking but i can do that i dont want to be promotional here so if you want i can share what i have done until now ^^ for the moment im still at the gpt models because it takes a lot of time to do the proper research sometimes there are just no answers and you have to take a guess based on your knowledge and experience,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmaU55dnJLYkRRa0pPb28tanlTbjc4cm5WSF92TWpMR1NoMWJyZ0huMk5BOTRzTGY3RUFpNERoZWI2MDZSS3NubU02aXZ1UFB4dkFEaFJGWXJJbnhmWTh3YzZlanZ0Ync3QWFwQVZIcFcxQ009

weight sharing is a great idea when i was reading the attention is all you need paper and diving deeper in its ideas i learned that weight sharing not only reduces the size of the model but can potentially act as regularization since you learn a more robust representation by having the weights used at different stages of the model see paperusing the output embedding to improve language models<url>by ofir press and lior wolf i think this technique makes sense when using languages that share some kind of similarities in the original transformer the use cases were translations between english and german and english and french and these languages share a lot of similarities beyond the common latin alphabet especially english and german since sharing the same weights makes all the embeddings live in the same space i think in this case the semantics learned by the embeddings are improved but maybe there arent much benefits or maybe even drawbacks when sharing between languages that have way different structures i havent read the aibert paper so maybe they did succeed in doing so i have written a blog post on the transformer and currently writing about the evolution of decoderonly models im doing so purely for my education and hobby and dont want to be promotional but i can send you the link if you want to give it a look ^^,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVW81YWM0d1d6WmhLdzJKN3ZBd2tad0FrczJ1eDJXaFhmc3RSQWJQaTRKSjd6dmpyaF9yX1p0MFFRYkF2WFcyMG9qdklVZjZLZV94X0IyUjlmRGh3a0IyZ3lqUTBEOWs5SjYxU2NKNzlyVlU9

training data is more like a boundary than a target the target is reality and training data is the bounds the issue is your statement implies the training data is both target and bounds a hallucination is an ai response that contains false or misleading information within the bounds of the training data when training an llm the hope is that the llm is somehow able to extract truth from this big pile of data that contains a mixture of true and false information if the goal was to match the training data then that would be like saying false information is ok because no training set is perfect,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsTkFMNThVc0NkUUQ0QU9RYjZTWThjd0VZM1EyWC01eE02aklRYU1HdkNvdXNsdng2aHd4UVBqLWpiS0F0RjJFUzNIY2ppeWJtbzQ4MEY0eFBmZkhlTkE9PQ==

this is really interesting thx something i like to focus on is regimes your model might be realy good or bad a specific regimes over time may i suggest compiling your cvtest folds and running some regime labels or structural shifts for example if your model sucks at recessions and your test set is a recession or vice versa etc etc in any case when you put all your cv folds together in a giant test set and plot them you can start to see how it tests its also a great practice for tunning may i also suggest a purged and embargoed kfold,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsSkpRc1J0VHZwUnFrTjJqQjR4OVBjNm1Ua201YmR2OWJfZ2lqS3h1TzQzOWtuVHJzVmZ2YlpmclVldUVXODZ6NDFIZEx3UklnT1l1bVRnbFR4cUFVWUE9PQ==

yes finetuning means training the model on a much smaller amount of data with a substantially different distribution than the original training data this causes the model to apply large gradients and change to respond more in line with the new distribution if the new distribution isnt too different from the original it achieves a substantial amount of transfer learning but crucially that amount of transfer learning is not <number> the larger gradients applied during fine tuning are inevitably a bit like a bull in a china shop destroying some of the finergrained learning the model did when training with the original distribution and the model definitely becomes weaker by washing out some of what it previously learned as it makes much more coarsegrained adjustments with smaller quantities of and therefore noisier data to match the new distribution,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsMWxQYTlXVDNKcFBTV1pON3dOX282bVNydjd0dl9hWDNZdk5rUXhSNFNjbVdDOU5zNGlId0xIZ1FhYkpCRDN4N1E4OFdZN2s1NkpLdGlla3h5X0pSYWc9PQ==

>if the goal was to match the training data then that would be like saying false information is ok because no training set is perfect if i train an llm with millions of pages saying that george washington is immortal then that is technologically identical to training an llm with the statement that queen elizabeth is the queen of england this is a machine learning technologists subreddit so i assume that we actually care how the technology works so that we can fix it properly fixing an llm that states that george washington is immortal because it was told so <number> times is a completely different process than fixing an llm that states that george washington is immortal because it just invented that statement out of thin air the former is a problem you solve with data cleaning just as you solve the queen elizabeth problem with data updating the latter is presumably the problem that op wanted to discuss which is much less straightforward to solve inventing an llm which comports with reality is not a technological problem its a philosophical problem at best lets start with the question of who is the avatar who decides what is or is not real and then how we measure the llms correspondence with this oracle these are not technical problems if it was told exactly once that george washington is immortal then one can expect its other information to overwhelm this one error if it repeated the lie it would be a flaw in the software but still not a hallucination there is a reason that it is called a hallucination and not just an error its a special category of error that arises from stochasticity as opposed to from bad training,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsZlJRREVSWFZiSnhBaU5lMW1WaXZFd2lvbkVCVkRRRjc0dXZINzVnTTFKeXBHYVZNakp1b29PUnJKN3ZRVDV5dVFMRUJCbFEza1FwNnNZOTdWNTVtOU1QMHVFanB5TFRxeXhHYTIxbFVWbVE9

this approach is good you can triangulate the markers points and find their d coordinates but this will be up to a scale factor now because you know the markers size you can rescale the whole world so that your d measurements and pysical distances match thats the principle in practice locating points isnt perfectly precise so your d measurements will have some error for instance the further a marker is the less precise we can locate its points because were somewhat limited by our pixels so the less precise your triangulation will be typically for stereo the error grows as z so using more markers is good using more markers and estimating their uncertainty is even better,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsdGs1T0tMUW42dUkyQkR2NE1sM2xLVXlCaFMtTzlNUndvdU00N3diWWVkbHhqc2VVbHFGU3JhSXhNTldqYTVaRWtiTU9XakZQQUNURXA1dGpialNxNkE9PQ==

i am currently looking into the prompt management feature of langfuse in more detail while tracing is great and provides clear value for reasons already mentioned in other posts i have trouble deciding for the prompt management feature in particular as it abstracts you further away form the prompt formats options and granularities and it feels like it is too early to do this sure the overhead is manageable and the latency is ok i guess but while nontechnical persons can join with maybe nonreally thought through prompts that are then converted by the utilitymethod i rely on that conversion a lot i would like to get a prompting management tool that allows me to compare versioned prompts for different models and use cases in a transparent and easy to access manner across <number><number> teams but does not get so say ambitious that it wants to abstract me further away from the model just yet it is a bit like the show me the prompt discussion i guess if anyone had a recommendation for such a prompt comparison management tool that is less ambitious to that regard i would be highly thankful i keep looking,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsWU5qY2xfcHBQOElXMEE4cVFBZHdDM3VaSVhnQnFYNmpYcUlZdXgwcXhDdU0yVGVxdVFUUnlHb1NJMEVQOWp3bFZ4RnpoY1ROYlBoT3pzcjE1WUxoYlE9PQ==

hey everyone as a professional at cetpa infotech id like to share my perspective on the evolving field of data science the notion that data science is dead is a bit of an overstatement what we are witnessing is a natural evolution of the field data science is becoming more integrated with machine learning engineering and software engineering this is because the complexity and scope of datarelated problems are growing necessitating a broader skill set for those in data science this means acquiring software engineering skills to effectively build deploy and maintain ml models on the other hand the role of a data scientist is indeed diversifying while some may transition to ml engineering others might focus more on business analysis bridging the gap between data insights and business strategy this shift doesnt signify the end of data science but rather its expansion and specialization automation is streamlining many routine tasks but the core skills of a data scientistlike problem formulation data interpretation and strategic thinkingremain crucial and irreplaceable at cetpa infotech we see this evolution as an opportunity for growth and innovation in our training programs ensuring our team and students are equipped with the latest skills needed in this dynamic landscape thanks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsQmVwWTBYa0V1ZzY5enU5QXd6UkwwLWNsRWNid29UQkhKVkpGam9keG1UQjlPNlc5a3E4ZGFoLWVqSjdJX2xTZEwtck0tZ3NwQ2hxQnY2b3VuRmdKVmc9PQ==

itll cause a lot of issues if you cant publish at the top venues because you have little incentive to youll have a much harder time getting good phd students which means a harder time publishing itll also be more difficult to get large grants and itll be more difficult to switch to another university because theyll value a different set of venues which makes it more difficult to move because of life circumstances and more difficult to switch to another university if you dont get tenure at your institution i absolutely understand your point about sometimes not having a choice but id think long and hard about it and id always favor another school if they do value your publications at the core ml venues,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsVVR4RWlCRmgwbC1jYk13VWJ4OWFXVHJPRHktQ0wtOHJHbDJGXzdOY2dnRmkwSEQzZVlNUXZCLWtJRU00bi1Va3hTTkEzUmwxQW1TdDRYNm5BalZjZEE9PQ==

computer science as a discipline is a bit different from other stem fields and it is more so for ml in ml the researchers value conferences over journals primarily due to the pace of innovation you simply cannot wait <number> years for your manuscript to be reviewed back and forth and then rejected by a journal your work would become obsolete in ml with that timeframe of review only research that comes out of very mature technologies with a big author list would be submitted directly to journals like the work of alphago and the likes which were submitted to nature that being said a lot of the ml conferences encourage submitting extended manuscripts after acceptance to their sister journals like the transactions in ml ones i have never seen any cs department in top universities at least in the us not recognizing top conference acceptances as significant contributions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsZWJhTHZXSk1iNEg3ZnAwM2lnOTZvQ2dhTFp3RktqeUJqTG40LTFreDN3ZUhVNEdsWTV4aGZRWnZrdGtWRUJ4OVhNY2dUckdFa2xiY08tc25uTElhNzVQdjY2cTBfZ1lyTWNidmdLNDJWdWs9

there are some significant areas of misunderstanding here for one a gam does not have to have a link function the link function in the case of using a gam for regression is just using the identity function that is the equivalent of what a kan neuron is doing to keep it really simple linear regression is a weighted combination of variables plus a bias which i will ignore from here mlp weighted combination of weighted combinations of variables plus a nonlinear activation function relu which itself is just doing a spline approximation of a true function kan linear combination of learned nonlinear functions of variables with splines approximating the learned nonlinear function gam linear combination of smooth functions of input variables with logistic regression for example or without just regression a link function lastly with gams there are many ways to do it you can use a predefined basis expansion of your input variables and just learn the coefficient on this expanded feature set as is done in a volterra nonlinear model with kans we are learning each of these nonlinear functions with spline approximation edit realized i kept writing gan where i meant to say gam damn gankangam acronym similarity,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsZVBDYXYwYWc5Y2tya0VhOWZQM3Y1NHRkeXFBU1BxdmFCOGRRUExFRjRCWTUtOWF1RWl0aE5NLUN5RDJIS2tNMGY3SkV1VlpaZlYwc3pPOUxBaklsVFFKYXBTbHNtMFBQTS1td25aRXVjR1E9

noob question im using sklearn and im trying to load my own dataset for the first time i had been using the toy datasets when i use wine or breastcancer everything works fine i load them with stuff like this data = datasetsloadbreastcancer x = datadata<url> y = datatarget<url> when i try to use a local file that is formatted in svmlight format i tried to load it with data = datasetsloadsvmlightfiletraindat and i get attributeerror tuple object has no attribute data when it hits these lines x = datadata<url> y = datatarget<url> i assume theres some sort of metadata that im not including somewhere but im not sure how to include it thanks in advance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZE9PQUFfUkFYaHhIbEJDUDRyWE80S3dTNV82akw2WmVHOVJxUlFIVG1DS3ZvZkdqbGlqbWJNMnd1UGtUcmJRRmtjaDIySzIwSjBVbG5jaU96S2JOckE9PQ==

tokenizers are not at all optimal at least grammaticallysemantically as i explain below except in some sense of guessing the most appropriate tokensvocabulary for a given allowed budget i think the tokenization hack stated with english alone or maybe in the beginning with only two languages for translation between only two to german the actual minimum number of tokens would be eg <number> the english alphabet plus maybe <number> for uppercase letters though case can be handled differently with one extra flag output and a few extra tokens for punctuation and control in the modern era you want also tokens for imagesvideo and sounds like im not sure down to for each sample maybe <number> for each soundpressure level just mentioning since would constrain the budget even if you would do otherwise <number>bit sound or logarithicm so im digging into why not some minimum or maximum used and it could be used even just two tokens for bits that are not at all semantically meaningful i think a minimum or nearminimum was at one point not workable but now would be with larger models or so i hope that optimizers would converge to learn from any alphabettoken scheme that could easily learn given even only letters for spelling like we all do as humans i actually predict with a fixed budget say <number> an often used max that current tokenization would converge to bigrams plus byte tokens if the training data were large enough with all languages or at least scripts of the world some ideal for any one language would be one token per word and have all words available but that would give <number>+ tokens for english alone or you have a rare word problem any subword scheme is a nice hack not grammatically optimal for any language likely neither when many are tokenized you might have university etc but then nonoptimal for spanish where you want universidad with ity > dad ending change for many such words neither is optimal for the other language but you could have univers and likely would get that alone with an even mix of english and spanish and then ty and dad tokens in my scheme actually universi in <number> tokens now are those semantically meaningful tokens does it matter neither is universi i cant just train on icelandic i mean that might be nice in an icelandic only world or even english plus icelandic nor do i want to incrementally add languages ie take tokens away from other languages if i have a fixed max vocabulary size letters only are semantically meaningful as well only letters bigrams seemingly nonsensical to some but they would actually help to constrain future token prediction eg if a word starts with a it would come from many languages but a word starting with the token a could only fit icelandic,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtY212QTllNER2VGc0dm1pUUFkaTUyQTVQLVhVN2lqUHFsemV2bEFseWRPMnViSmVwZ3pTZDNwRWZTdUtKT1M4X05lVGdCV0RacWRvN0J6Tlp2aXJLZ0E9PQ==

yes and no its important to understand the difference between the ai hype and the honest research happening what had always driven ai as a field is performance typically you need to beat previous performance on a limited number of tasks like classification and segmentation to turn heads in ai that cubic millimeter needs to outperform yolov or chatgpt or something thats unlikely to happen out of the box then there is the real science and research that is slower and less popular the discoveries are limited but meaningful in small ways they arent popular and that area of ai doesnt receive as much funding that crowd would die for good data that could be used for bio inspired architectures but dont expect the world from their work for a few decades,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtLWVnQ0VrUkg0Qm04Zkc3ekxVeHpHTDQ4NUdDVFJMRklZNTFDNjVLbVFkdm5IVkxVMEtpblNlRVN3WHhONkU1Ulh2UlhTRUlsdHRfTmFtUWQ0X005MHc9PQ==

currently building a linear regression to determine salaries im in the testingtraining phase right now and its pretty inaccurate the algorithm is not optimized very well yet which is part of the reason but i think it also has to deal with the fact that its trying to predict the exact salary and even a dollar in either direction marks a wrong prediction i was thinking of using a margin of error to circumvent this as long as predictions are in a ish percent range of the true number it passes but was wondering if theres a more statistically grounded way to accomplish this i dont have a maths background so i wouldnt know myself,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJta3BIU2o2OVFVWWtrOUpaZnhBY3V2Z0tEWWVWY0RYMzJmWE9PQ0dQMS0xdmEySndfMUhpckxPUUh2QUk3MUhBU2FSREVUVWM0MkNjc2tpLWkxa0JhMEhESmd5MmtzdHp0Zi1iZFdJbDFkSkk9

honestly the success of the predictor isnt really that important to any employer who you would actually want to work for youve actually got the right idea the care put into finding the data cleaning it building data pipelines utilizing advanced data analysis techniques etc is the actually important part along with the demonstration of the drive to actually put together a project endtoend like this in industry or academia not every predictor you make in industry will be successful or work but the stuff you build along the way and understanding of the process is quite important,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtQkIyZ0FNZGU2NWFFQVhjRml0TWZ3NUlOUGQtdTB1ZGhSRDZ6N3FnRGlmZFF2azRyRUVMemNuV1l3OWJyRDhCS1ZZOW50d3JYaW5LMGw0aFNxXy1EdkE9PQ==

i think this is a very biased answer laden with personal opinion and imho passive aggression researchers working on artificial intelligence are real scientists and often have strong neuroscience backgrounds models are often inspired by structures in the brain its true that modern ai architectures dont exactly resemble the brain but it is also true there are parallels and academic researchers do experiment with architectures that more closely resemble things they see in the brain sometimes to improve performance but often just to understand it better your answer is just wrong several levels mainly youre negating a whole range of research types its not always driven by performance new tasks types are routinely experimented on and the mapping the brain does impact ai in significant ways its how they were developed in the first place,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZ004eG9vS3JZUGRqTUdvWWNmTmlMVW5JQzd1Xy1tNzNEUTBLbFFTZEMyaW9qX2FUQlVvNTgyLUZEWlR4b0xMU1UybU9hY29PWGVPMDI1dTE0WWdQM0E9PQ==

i will give you a analogy example to make it easier imagine you are looking for the spot in a football field which contains the most amount of gold you can measure this amount from every spot but its pretty expensive to do it for the whole field at the beginning you need to explore some points on the field to get an idea which region in the area contains some gold after a while you realised certain small regions contain a large amount of gold and you can either <number> exploit and choose spots near these regions because it is likely to contain as many more or even larger amount of gold <number> explore and choose regions that are far away and unexplored it is possible that these regions contain even larger concentration of gold but you havent explored them yet but its also possible they have nothing hence this is the exploration and exploitation tradeoff you can either hammer away at comfortable regions with higher certainty of reward exploitation or choose to look for unexplored areas with higher risk but possibly higher reward exploration going back to the ml example imagine you have found a hyper parameter of x=<number> giving good performance and you have another chance to choose the next hyperparameter then you can either choose somewhere close eg x=<number> with high chance of getting similarly good or higher performance exploit or choose somewhere unexplored x=<number> with no certainty but possibly much better performance exploration,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtTFFMM2hNZThIZW1vdE1zaHM3SWhQMm5mYm9ZRWVQRHc4RVFXWVRhc1FzLWNVNnhmT0pUY2hoekNEYXF0NGRpdU5pcXpNQ2RTTHZBQ1A5NXBOTWYxT3c9PQ==

learning rust for performance critical code for deep learning doesnt make much sense at least if you use nvidia gpus cuda cc++ is what you would want to learn and the parallel programming paradigm in general gpu programs are pretty different to the usual way we write cpu code you can check the cudamode community it has a lot of great resources theres also triton which sits between python and cuda in terms of abstraction level its pretty handy but to write good triton code you will have to learn cuda concepts anyway so its not like you can skip learning the lowlevel stuff,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtVVBtaklVeC01N2lNVHVab3JrVG1qWmlCallrVmVwWXZzSG9zVGozS0huaVFmZFM3a0tLMFdiTmFBV2pKWXBzSl92bEgwcmpWY1JiT1ROVTRwMVBndFRqdElSaGRZVkEwdkFuWlducHJLeXM9

yes i mean userclicks is one of the input variables first you start with your version of the weighted output no ml just some sum product then you use the user clicks for changing the weights here all variables including the likes engagement etc act as input variables and the video the user clicks on has been ranked as one the model would over time accumulate the user click data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtTmgxcEVqaHFBek81aUI2ZTY0bEVicVh5S0NWbWM4bTF2QXBZOFQ1SFZDQ0FXZHY2S2ZaNDRwUDhCUzhydHZHN29mX3V2ZWstcm9NUm1EMXM5a1BiYUE9PQ==

well technically you can just set weights however you want because there is nothing that says what video rank is better than another so theres no way for anyone to say your model is right or wrong correct you can literally just randomly pick a video out of the <number> and return it and no one can say its wrong because there is no way to evaluate how good it is if its part of a competition how is the winner decided as it stands since there is no way to compare models to say which is a better ranking model its impossible for anyone to win the competition the only clue i see as to evaluating your model is this >recommend three videos for a new aspiring channel to grow based on the model findings this suggests that the best model will rank video such that the top rank video will lead to better growth this means your actual target is channel growth such that the highest rank video will lead to the highest growth and the second rank video will lead to less growth etc maybe distilled down you want to know which videos lead to the most channel subscriptions in a <number> week period or something similar that would make the most sense from a supervised learning task but its still a bit unclear you would need to have the data that says how much a channel grew after each video was posted otherwise there is no real job here you can return a random video and be done with the challenge since no one can say which model is better since there isnt a way to compare is this video better or is this other video better,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtX2FVZFNYOEpJZzZtMEplbHdMemJlRjNvXy02UDFkNjFISDFDcms4bnFmSTJZNWNHcERPSEMtYnlMRW1wcUhTRHEtaVdFckdqMHppS3pnWE5JWVluYVE9PQ==

their early lectures i think up to the th one at least are mostly in cuda c and they require some knowledge about pointers and memory ops in general but you dont need to have a strong background in c to follow along that being said i think that it would definitely help to learn some basic c beforehand and for cuda c++ in special some knowledge of c++ concepts is definitely required i dont think you need to be a c++ expert to write very efficient kernels but you will need to learn about some more advanced c++ features like templates its also probably more important to understand on a more conceptual level how gpu programs work since many kernels can also be written in triton for often slightly worse performance than cuda kernels,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtX3FwdWtnSE5QalYwVHNqWkQ3LWZEQnVvOEZjVDFSZ1FxSUsyakVxQjJZUjhmeDhqbEdPQW1WcHdtYWxlaTZ6X1hJMlFTUnZFSGtKa1VYbDBIZjB1cnlRdVltVnYxbC1EVjZzUGZ4OUNwZTg9

performance critical code needs to run on the gpu assuming it can be parallelized so perhaps your main consideration should be how easily another language lets you do that are you content with being able to write cuda code or do you want a language that also provides higher level gpu support c++ supports options other than cuda with things like nvidias thrust library and openmp offloading to gpu julia also supports things like xla flux cuarrays as cuda alternatives as well as having a variety of autodiff libraries,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtbzRXeXcycF9wQndqNzRqTi1BU2dBQWluRi1MNTFhcElBM0xGdVRXUDVkLVNtRV9CUS1iWVVrZGNqVnRPYlRDRTFpVTl6ZVdWMVhpQ2hjSTRBR2lYbVE9PQ==

im a high school student who does research and qualified to isef so ill give my quick two cents high school research is great i love being able to do what i love and getting a head start on what i love doing so much and plan to continue in the future in high school but thats not true for everyone if you look up the krish pai scandal for isef <number> you will see how much high school research has gone to hell its not even about research or its quality anymore its about winning the big flashy awards with the huge price tags that get everyone into hypsm many of the kids on my isef team were totally ready to give up on their field of study after they got into college which is a sentiment expressed by other people on this thread high school research isnt research its publishing to get into a good college a lot of people have done research where they proved that if you have the word novel in the title for your project it is <number><number> times more likely to win an award so high school research is about flashiness not rigorousness of the actual research but its not fair to make generalizations either because there are people who genuinely love what they do like i do and plan to pursue it in the future another person on my team did something related to breast cancer and is flying out to india to synthesize some of the polymers that he created for his project im doing something similar where im reaching out to companies with organic chemists that might be willing to help synthesize my inhibitors research is research and high school students should be doing it only if they love it not if they dont,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtMkVCWGlVN0VVT2U4ZHZLbXJWWVRoZXg4amhwTE9xMHdPck83bW51WDZocGFtUC1vTTZZWUlSNGVHeC1rVXFJXzZGSDRhWWJtczBCR2IyUHo3WFh5eGc9PQ==

i dont understand the question i assume you want to use jupyter with a gpu local to your device in that case follow the instructions here <url> to install cuda with torch locally preferably into a conda or venv environment when you have the environment set up make sure to add it to the kernel list for your jupyter setup then you can instantiate a notebook using that kernel,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtSXBzcEhvYUJzSFJYX0JuSEt0cnpRY3Q0U3AxYWpaOFo5LUo1MUttVUtpUHNqeWdWSk85Smpac0RoUmRIQWlaWndZb1lZWFNNMk5RelM5NlVvazVNVGxwMDA5Wk9rQ1BVWDlQSTZpaGFUOGc9
i would say absolutely yes but we are still years if not decades or more away from seeing its results the issue with the human brain is that so far we heavily assume how it processes information it has a ton of different inputs audio visual tactile olfactory gustatory hormonal etc which cant so easily be mapped to a human body we know in general how these affect us but you cant precisely say that after you ate an apple this set of nerves triggered these which released this hormone in this amount and this of that hormone went to this different subset of the brain the more you think about it the more you realize why the human brain isnt stupid compared to these machine learning algorithms it just processes tons of information in different ways being fit for millions of different tasks if it was focused on a single algorithm it would i assume likely beat any computer we can develop fit for that task for the next several centuries if not millennia the brain gave a good basis for deep learning and deep learning afterwards took a path that slowly deviated from the original concepts however any discovery on the human brain has a potential to be a hit or miss for a new algorithm in a sense to map a human brain would require to map the whole human body as well or at least most of it down to every cell and even then you encounter the issue that every human body is different to some extent if you want to learn more about this look into cognitive science and cognitive computing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtcUhlQjZGRlVhWWo2aDNLUDRUYXJ6MU1qSVBTRXV4UWVmNkl1MkFOd3c0b1IxdVZ3b3dYcjBYeXdaQlZQbFoxdExKYnZKTHNodFlyVFdtY0tEQ0lGVVE9PQ==

ill respond to this in two parts for most researchers you can probably get away with the bare minimum approach which is understanding how gpus handle memory and perform ml operations this will help you train models and understand how to debug them however in order for any new approach to be adopted and be scaled up like a new attention mechanism like flash attention or variation of convolution or the newly released mamba various scan operations that are used in things like griffin from dm they need to absolutely have a cuda implementation otherwise there is simply no reason for anyone else to adopt them since people are interested in building models in practice hence why flashattention is so popular,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtbnB6dDQ0c1NFX1BmMmVIZ2o0ZzVlcHdVUmoyMmJ6a09jUUcyT3Qyekt5eW5iSnBCZFE2TDBDcW4tTExmNVl3NjhZWnhIU2JjdnNaN2pHTHRZWnQ0ZWc9PQ==
first and foremost this is a good candidate post for rlearnmachinelearning ok with that out of the way what chatgpt designed is a network able to overfit the data overfitting is the phenomenon where a model in this case your neural network learns the data it was trained on by heart meaning that it does a perfect job with it but that does not mean that it is a perfect model not even close the moment you put the model to predict a new different observation from what it was present in the training data results become way worse you can imagine your model as a little kid trying to learn to add numbers together you show the kid that <number>+<number>=<number> and that <number>+<number>=<number> many many times therefore the kid learns perfectly those additions however due to either the data the kid itself or the training technique the kid just knows by heart those two additions but without understanding the underlying logic behind addition therefore the moment you give the kid a new addition to compute it will fail miserably and the same will happen to your model to fix this you can learn about model validation and testing good luck,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtVEp2OVQtYTN5c0VwR0xfS2xFTzJqX2cyNmFHZTJMdlI1cmw2OFVxR2hZRzJ1bWlMdXliT1E2elJ2TVlCSkpoNmRPbDYtLUR2UVJaXzBFNlc1NUJxc2c9PQ==

thanks for vocing out but no i dont think cope cherrypicked the comparisons it is a bit toy on the modeldata fronts but thats perfectly fine for a fresh arxiv paper and the authors are absolutely transparent on this with a delicate limitation section provided kudos to that what i was trying to say is that one aspect of copes solution duplicated position is a mature idea for making long contextcapable llms with a few explorations done already but they are not discussed in the paper i believe it is highly likely that copes authors just dont know works from long context folks have landed on the partially same solution as they do as t is not ropebased so they might have discounted that rerope is only a blog so unless you follow jianlin su ropes first author closely one can miss that too in fact if i am reading it right the relativecapped baseline made in copes sec <number> looks damn close if not exactly same to the infinity rerope variant mentioned in jianlins blog selfextended might be more relevant but it is still a very new paper jan <number> i just feel like it would be nice to discuss those works and maybe try cope on the real long context tasks these works are focused on because i envisioned it is likely to be very capable there too cope has enough differences from those mentioned methods for being contextaware and imo there is nothing wrong with focusing on the type of tasks they are focused on now sorry if i confused you before hope this clears things up,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtWDRPTmlhaldfbFUtRzRyeVVXZ0xfU25ITjd2aFB0OHQ2RkJoMlU5Y2F5WlA2VUxaaEpMWUZUU3piakZlbzRaUU5PcGJlRnhxdHZ1REM0VkYzRnhjRkE9PQ==

if you check out the <number> submissions there were a few berts in there im planning a submission this year using bert simply because it performs better than other models for my particular use case given that bert is a smol boi and will run on a potato if it works well for your task then its worth using so in summary id say yes bert is still definitely relevant,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuLVlPLUpwNVJ4UFJJVnlzaE5YODRVT3BNMENkWDE5ZXl6UUF5SmFLSVJEVHhKN091TW5vdTlpZkc2Y0xseTFTYlhFZEM0NU0yYi1fNnBZSmtzMi01amc9PQ==

you are doing sentiment analysis this is a binary classification there is no reason to combine those other mechanisms with bert you are mixing here different approaches to feature extraction attention bert convolution cnn and recurrency rnns there is no reason to attention inside bert already takes care of learning context for feature ext sraction outputs of bert are contextaware tokens and finetuning those with mlp head is enough for classification more attention layers can improve bert additional context or more mlp layers better discriminative abilities what do you think you gain from those additional layers there is a reason why everyone uses attention for nlp except for mamba and ssms and modern rnns like rwkv but this is a totally different approach,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuck82dEQ3b1ljcE95TEp0aDRDRlFnYks5NHkwRUVXcWczTmFQMzVNMmIycVV0dUlsVW5TaU5MRUZ2eVNJOC1HR0hhbURSRU9ZakpyYUVxTWZneEtwdUE9PQ==

your answer is very insightful but i am not convinced flash attention clearly requires a deep knowledge of hardware to figure out it is not some side project that someone made efficient it is ee or lowlevel dev stuff mamba is really a novel architecture overall i am not sure what to make out of it but if you can come out with this idea you will be able to write the specific parts regardless of what you need to do or to get some assistance there overall i would argue that cpp becomes a low priority most of the research re attention is more mathematical than similar to fa eg people reinvent rnns i do however agree that knowing cpp is way better than knowing any other language for ml research excluding python we should add llm stuff to the reasons to learn c and cpp since many libs work on cpu with native code,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuVTY0TnJscVQzZU1rUUE3UjZqbzRySU5iQzZRMkZOdEItWENnVWlkbWVibmVpcnRpMkNnLVFjRGlxWUo4cXlpeWRXVlYzR0R3WlZxVE55OWlHUmhoNWZOWEZMTUlJWkVjUy1KU2ctWEtmbUk9

it is because when we are using less data points like in the case when we have small batch size then the no of negatives will be less and also there might is possibility of false negatives present in the small batch so the gradient updates will not happen correctly when we have large batch size then acc to the formulae of cl it is easy to learn the embedding and also the prob of false negatives affecting the learning will be less as compared to before,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuWEk0M2NDYTBocHdEcU5HWVdJcEpZcDFrMGZNQnlmY0t4SlNSNkdRWmd6Tl8yeEV5SVlYTURZT3dEbTdaUWNsdEtob3hZR3AxYTdmU29hamRrbDBRaGZtNWNaMU00QWJyT1l3VVEyeVR3elU9

not sure whats the best at the moment but you could try my implementation of mamba for classification <url> its pretty on par with roberta etc i should do some official comparison the biggest advantage is its bloody fast to train and because its based on mamba theoretically has infinite context length zero shot is also interesting meta has a prominent example on huggingface but drawing a blank on the model name that should give higher accuracy for the teacher model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJudmJLY292MDg2c0VaSUFwektneXlOQ21SX2hHX21mWkpzNTBLX3o1WDBVckEtUjduc3RnX3c4cXdrMXJXVGF0d1E1UVVsX3hVRFZNemdveUp3c0FtNEE9PQ==

i did some work like this you can absolutely use llms for recommender systems however it is expensive and we did not find that it outperformed more traditional methods enough to justify the cost so we didnt move forward with it super fun stuff to play with and if i had more time i would have generated a research paper or two on it because we were definitely covering new territory especially at the time <number> hours on a t is nothing by the time my model was working halfdecently i was training for ~<number><number> a hours for a ~<number>m param model you will not get good results just mapping products into tokens <number><number> you want something that looks more like a grammar where multiple tokens describe an item and the tokens that describe the item have some sort of meaning and semantic to relate them to each other and the item sort of like how phonemes make up words i spent about mos fiddling with this problem nearly full time it made a cool model and data pipeline but ultimately not enough roi to move forward you are starting in the same place where i started ~mos ago with this but if i were approaching this today i think i would take a pretty different approach i would start with a pretrained llm or vlm and try to bang my data into a form that i could use for finetuning with as much preserved human language as possible instead of making a new token space theres just too much information lost boiling items into tokens one important characteristic of modern recommender systems is that they understand the items on far more dimensions than user<>item interactions llms are perfect for this you end up acquiring a new problem which is how to map your generated hallucinated items into items in your id space but i think theres other ways to handle that with search algorithms,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuejFUYm1VNTI1SzVMbUswOUVuRmswc2dIUjlEbk1BTmx0NUg0RlpvMExuYmpFUUFTRTZDZTRTZjhURHNWLS1URlRfZU9XdWZtVnJSTlp1UkZkcGQtcWc9PQ==

hmm maybe its the startup culture but we have incorporated it into a lot of our daily stuff we use it wherever the older tech was cumbersome or inefficient and when theres another person interfacing it we use it for preprocessing and fast analytics lots of unstructured data no problem weve got a simple upload data > summarize api analyze interesting insights and improve our knowledge graph weve got an api that be plugged into the kg that ingests the data as per the ontology for the kg few shot classification sure data tagging for traditional model building this is our prized possession we built a framework to tag data for us when we dont have enough faster than humans not as accurate but it eases pain points were currently building chatbots with analyst capabilities too lots of devs use it on my team me included and all of us are geeks so we love experimenting and playing with it its almost like a pet project that responds back its fun,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuRzEzZ3Z1ZHpqbDdnRFdzQi1LN2ZwLVU0YTZfYXRreTNpdFViMkt6U0pLZFp1VDRjdXlqWE1seEx2WGRTRlBIeGdleG4yMlEzbWk3RFJzMW1DVmJCRGc9PQ==

in addition do you mind elaborating on something that looks more like a grammar where multiple tokens describe an item and the tokens that describe the item have some sort of meaning and semantic is this an effort to reduce the size of the vocab i also have the idea of using llm to predict the shortened product description which uniquely identifies a product but that approach would not reduce the vocab size,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuSGx2M0RGYXl2N1oxRGFsZDZZdGdHOVRsR2hKTGZjcVpjVzJQcXJkZlJnNGdDQV83aW1QR0NhRlkyZWVPNm5qWEFrUEl4NWxTQ0lxTEtIbDdSME5IeHc9PQ==

i have worked extensively in recommender system couple of thoughts of mine <number> the data size is way less no of users that is k is very small <number> reduce the no of parameters extensively and then do study with different techniques or tricks see which technique gives you best then perform a full gpt size model training or try simple models like lstm or wordvec first <number> i am assuming you are finetuning the model since the batchsize and learning rate is very small and using product id as you token a if you want to see whether decoder style architecture can capture user preference try to train fresh rather than finetuning with product id as token b if you want to finetune the model then rather than product id as your token make product name as your token and try with that also see if you can incorporate other metadata regarding the product into your model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuVTVNMlNlV1VzTGVYZE04UUtDMnRNNzhVSkhSRjVTVlQ5SC0zUFNUdUpQUzBvNlFJbFAxUmhXVTJnaFY2S2x5Q1dMdk9RQVFZQ3Flc084UFZrYUhlbDhjYkUtZVY1MThSYkJ0QmY3c1Y3Qlk9
if you are encoding one instance at a time you could try batch encoding ensure you are using the nograd context so you can pack more examples into each batch edit you can also speed up the process by using a sortish sampler and configuring the data collator to pad either to the longest sequence in the batch or maxlength,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTjVzVGFkbU5ET1pyWW5GMFN0UTMzVFR2SGlSV25vYWdkYy10dGJLTFVpWFA4R0NmR2RXOTFycVN1MU53RWF2STRGdnl5dVFpSXltREw3ZUNFaDVjZklkNEVaQlIzX1pyZUp6U1hCNHdQMFU9

the old idea of recurrent neural networks is identical to to the linear gaussianmarkov chain formulation with the except of the d matrix and the dependency of the target on the current input however the old rnn idea had issues that the product of transformations a^k for k steps either vanishes or explodes as a remedy lstms gate the activations of the memory and current input to avoid the explodingvanishing recurrent computations the state space models have unearthed the basic concept of linear gaussianmarkov models aka old school rnn and made it computationally feasible by means of a series of tricks the first is to expand the recurrence in the formula of the memory and define the prediction as a weighted sum of each elements in the sequence the weights are defined as the kernel matrices c a^k b therefore no backpropagation through time is needed and the models are more computationally feasible than rnns sounds like little contribution which arguably it is but it makes a difference then there is the angle of contribution from the restrictionsconditions on how we represent a b c from the s paper before mamba definitely they are using decade long models rnn aka linear gaussianmarkov models but they have presented a series of tweaks on how to efficiently train a deep stack of those models of course the overall contribution is on modeling sequences in on using deep learning which is practically relevant that being said i do not find this less innovative that the transformer paper attention is all you need which despite impacting the field a lot is also a low scientific contribution personally i think that the concept of keeping a state or memory is essential for autonomous agents and i do not think that the current transformers logic of predicting the next sequence element subject to a long context without a memory makes sense,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuOGxsb2N4WEpEOEhlWFZzVzBMSHhlQzctN2ptQjhoV2k0YTVuVUZXbS1XekRESTYzY3B6S0xGQW4yRWVhUEs3Ty1FcmFYYW9kUnlGMkMzVVhoVDNoOEd3djZMYl9udkw5RzNjbWVkRk5JRWc9

hi im wondering if ductile fracture of metals available in fe software abaqus can be modelled using pinns these models are generally built after testing grooved coupons which result in different triaxility levels this requires lots of testing and modelling of each coupon to find the relationship between fracture strain and triaxility what would be the physics to include in the pinns,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUHpKTG5xZTFmZFZkd3NlUTVMXzFUeEh6UW9fdTk1ZkNUUGpsQUl3MVgtTnQzYWNxLUZVUXdTWE9hQjVSWUVnam1Fb0dROUxYRWtBaXZqcE9jb1VHTkg1SnJ3cjlNMl9YdzVqSjIzQ3ptNlE9
we worked on something like this for a client by worked i mean it never got off the drawing board due to the fact that the typical product catalogue is always changing and it requires a significant amount of capital to keep up with that if you are using a transformers model also as others have mentioned as well it does not outperform the cheaper alternatives you may turn to something like finetuning an existing model but then again you run into the changing catalogue problem tldr fun poc very costly and inefficient production system,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJudHlhZGY2aE1LRE5aY0NwMDZkekI5WEZ0STVBM1lXUFhzajhwRDZxZ0lmVUtxakYyenU2N25VUDFMeXpnZmllTlF4RDc0Yl9XQ2dfVnFtT3Jjcm5MUnc9PQ==
im not sure about how pinns would do this but bayesian inverse methods tackle this you begin with a prior distribution over your parameters then update the distribution based on the data making the posterior distribution this can be done with markov chain monte carlo or through vaes variational inference im sure someone has tried to generalize pinns to this application too,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuazg2NC00cEkxVk9SYTlZdU9RWjA0djBIOTBmRnJOZFdWN1M3Sk9janEwTF9PZ1hmLVZzd0RJTHVYYW94bUthQ0FkT1NJVGVjTmFzUlFRRjhlenFHeXc9PQ==

oh yeah that make sense and to clarify the gradient part you refer to is when you need to approximate the elbo by sampling i get this but there seems to be a lot of dission in this thread that probably assumes sampling is possible not sure if that changes anything i guess if you can sample from the true distribution p you do not need to do all this can can just take the expectation but again it might be possible to sample but for a general distribution like in vaes you also want to update the parameters of p and that is only possible if you know at least the parametric form of the distribution so my overall understanding is <number> if you cannot sample from p > you have to go for forward kl no other way <number> if you can sample idk how maybe a simulation gives you some samples but if you cannot back prop from p that again you have to do forward kl <number> you need samples in first place to approximate the integeral to calculate kl that is done via samples + elbo in vaes so sampling is not the problem but the gradient update is it is annoying that these things a left without a footnote <url><url> it just says however we do not do this for computational reasons whatever i said is possible not correct,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNF9VQkloX0pVXzBVMjR4T2MxMlF6ZU1nQmpvWmxFSV9kcEVhaTdSX1pSbExVYUZZRU51VC02bElkaUhpV2lmMFVpYy05ekhmcTdHUkhQOUJneHV4ZHc9PQ==

the only way i have found around this problem is to simplify for example almost all of classical econometrics at least the econometrics that i use for my work is summed up by the frischwaughlovell theorem for me the rest is basically issues with panel data and how to find my estimators is that way too simplified even for what i do yes would being armed with only those two statements get me into trouble with actual econometricians absolutely but the thing that these statements allow me to do is to use simple oftentimes geometric ideas to understand more complex things what i have come to understand is that there are just things that are difficult for a human being to understand or do visualizing a <number>dimensional projection of a <number>dimensional hypersphere is pretty damn hard as is running a marathon without any sustenance during the race itself its not a question of willpower at that point its a matter of what we are physically capable of instead of fighting that uphill battle i choose to use simpler tools to tackle more complex things its always going to be hard so i might as well travel light in my mind the question then becomes what is the paragraph summary or geometric intuition that encapsulates most everything you need to understand about a particular topic it may not look the same for each topic but it should be there otherwise you dont really understand the topic for example statistics for me is summed up by projections to lowerdimensional subspaces looking carefully at the data and understanding the assumptions of the model im considering again thats vague enough to raise some eyebrows but as long as i remember that its just a starting point i usually end up ok basically you need to accept that you will never have a complete atlas of every single detail of the field plus its difficult to carry that around in your mind or on paper but it is definitely possible to have a minimal set of tools that can help you deal with <number> of the problems you come up against the latter is far more manageable and actually enables you to think about bigger picture problems its important for your mind map to have the big landmarks in place with the details being a bit fuzzy for example i try to keep convergence proofs for algorithms as far away from my mind as possible i dont even like to waste time scanning through them why ive done s of them before and i dont think theyre very useful there may come a time when im totally stumped and need to look at a convergence proof but ill take my chances trying to have all the details straight only makes you confused my last piece of advice pick <number> to <number> research focuses they do not have to be well formulated but they should all incorporate a significant subset of the topics you are interested in at a technical level for example one of my interests is signal processing it combines my love for numerical computation statistics and optimization and forces me to use my knowledge to solve problems in other words you need practice after learning the basics the only way to grow is through implementation and asking your own questions the important thing is that you know what to do when youre confronted with a problem not having an encyclopedic knowledge of your fields of interest,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTUs2TU9Td2t5a0lmSjZjeUFrQXJLYlRxZTNJTV9BOUJZR21QSktDWHJlTVJRanNGRVdTazFnYTkxa2M4RFp5ZU0zZUNVMHFNUGdmUWF1WXZhazg3ZUE9PQ==

there is a lot of propoganda and interest in showing that ssms are better than transformer through hacked metrics and badfaith comparisons in long range arena settings even though it was recently shown that the apparent gaps are due to bad initializations i suspect that the forces behind this push have massive fomo and are trying to establish ssm as the dominant paradigm to capitalize these ideas into a flashy startup or something transformers are universal seqseq learners and show nonsaturating performance in addition results on the largest models are showing that the data itself is the bottleneck not the architecture all this to say be careful of the hidden agendas when doing research,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuWGprY245YzAtbUM0cGljalduRlY2WEVwUW9aekc5OG1OM2xRM0szWEdaaUpuaS11Qkt2OTFUZ19UVkFZMHlpdlNyZE5feHo3eS1RdTJBaEtSZWl3Z1BSSHJmbDN2OHEzcXcyRHdJOE1fRzA9

using llms to convert tables extracted from pdfs into a standardized format we feed in the extracted rows one by one as json objects and the model produces a new json with standardized fields we use gpt<number> with few shot prompting to prelabel data and manually reviewcorrect then we use this data to fine tune a b model which will be used in production using a training set of <number> rows and testing set of <number> we were able to achieve above <number> accuracy meaning more than <number> of the generated jsons were perfect still not in production so no business impact yet it has the potential to replace tens of thousands of lines of buggy data ingestion code generating and maintaining this ingestion code is the biggest cost associated with the project so it could have a very large impact biggest concern at this point is how to handle the <<number> of cases where the model makes a mistake we will probably use an off the shelf ml labeling tool in the short term but we havent found anything with a good ux for our use case so will likely need to build our own labeling tool eventually the existing nonml approach breaks when the table formats changes even a tiny amount so we are hoping ml solution will still be an improvement in spite of the occasional ml errors,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJudmFpQS1tTmtUNVRENmVpZGRNakRqR2NyVXQ0MnFMRThfbHMtUzdPakozV0dfbERwbGRCN3h6R3ZzODVMUFJjS2YwblRkVHZ1STdaQUxKT29aSjZINlE9PQ==

you also dont need to use oop in c++ in fact for highperformance applications aka the main reason to use c++ in fields like ml youre almost always going to be better off with a cachefriendly dataoriented paradigm instead not a single thing is stopping you from basically writing c code while using some of the more convenient features from modern c++ to save you time and help you produce better and more performant code templates constexprconsteval staticassert concepts scoped enums etc and not a single thing is stopping you from also having some of your code be oop at the same time where it is more convenient of course on a didactical basis it would be reckless to say you can use c++ without understanding oop you will want to learn the rules before you start breaking them i shudder to think what monstrous c++ code someone who never learned oop because it was too difficult but luckily someone said i didnt need it anyway would produce especially after firsthand experience with tons of realworld c code from actual professionals who like c because it means i dont have to think about memory management i never really quite understood memory management someone just kill me,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvaFgtUVBTNDZoNUk3UzBpTXNUclBLdEo2MGJkVmpfLTdrcmNieFd3bnRmWEpQTkNFX0tsSDRrME14dzlydExIRFM0em0taW1EYkVydnAyVmc3a09Ddnc9PQ==

mpi is extremely relevant if you want to train models that are bigger than what can be fit on one machine you need to be able to train partitions of that model on multiple machines and mpi allows your to implement the communication between machines through that training process same is true for inference most common to use the message passing functionality built into your library torch jax but when building some from scratch mpi is needed example of the later would be karpathys recent gpt c implementation,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvY1p6dV9URlhiaVE5UUVXVGp2UGFUT0hSU3BUZDhVdjdlbEF0emVHMkJFX2tZQ2VadTl4OGhZQTM4eF9sQmJ6SkFDN0dyTmVFemQzSk9lOUd4anpMNEtpdzRQOWxGeGhMWG91UWp3QVF1SXc9

i guess youre asking why this is a useful definition well basically were trying to find the minimal set of nodes such that conditioning on this set gives us all the information we can extract about some node of interest x youll see that coparents but not parents of coparents must belong to this set <number> suppose we have a collider structure ie x > z < y as z is a child of x it contains information about x so lets add z to the set of nodes on which we will condition but wait a second once we condition on z we have a path between x and y so they are no longer independent for example conditioning on wet grass z whether it rained x and whether the sprinklers went off y are now statistically dependent this is called explaining away thus we also need to include y the coparent in our set <number> now suppose we have the same structure but also consider a parent of y x > z < y < w weve added z and y to the set on which will we condition now conditioning on this set does w contain any information about x no because by the markov property x is independent of w given y for example once we know whether the sprinklers went off y knowing the sprinkler settings w is irrelevant hence we do not need to include the coparents parent,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvUjFoZDh1OVpfTGNYaVk5NDVyeWtWeV9PZFg5ZWxPQ19aejIyV2diUS1DY09DRGlPVDRnc1FqUHJ4M3lZWGxUMi1mM21KOGtfV3k3Q1YxTy1CWUtvc1E9PQ==

you need to rectify your license plate before you put it into any recognition model i cant tell you how to do this exactly there are a lot of ways to do that but most common are detection with yolo for polygons and segmentation with smth like unet or ultralitics yolo but then youd have to fiddle with polygon post processing to get the corner points regarding the pretrained model besides easyocr you can try trocr and paddleocr i think those are the best pretrained general models you can find unless you are working with tesseract binarization would harm you more than do good btw youd most likely need to train custom recognition model for best quality results plus if you can control it find the best spot for your camera it would save you a ton of postprocessing work,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvNFkyYU9HYUtQUkphTlo3VERuTW13c3VqbWV4a1JkRU5BSlp2RjMteFNHRHNmMmYzclZsYVZCWXhkWEpwNUhJY2lRMjczX3pPb0VGaWV3QW1PT0o2M3NjcjAxQ0gxTmxwVzlsM2pJZkFfTmM9

it really depends on what you want to do many other commenters have stressed that most modeling is done using existing python libraries eg pytorch or jax for deep learning and its hard to disagree with that especially for developing and prototyping new model architectures and or pipelines its far easier to just do this in python but its easy to find papers where authors suggested either new model architectures or more efficient solutions to a problem that required lowlevel manipulation of array data that would have been challenging to do using existing libraries so they had to write their own c++ cuda code to get the job done the first two examples that come to mind are mamba <url> and bitsandbytes which was used in the qlora paper <url> there are plenty of others also keep in mind that data preprocessing for large datasets can be quite slow in python and if you know how to write a c++ extension eg with nanobind to handle the ratelimiting steps you can accelerate data prep quite dramatically and this can be invaluable tldr youll probably end up doing most of your work in python but being competent in c++ and cuda can be very valuable for specific applications i dont think youll regret learning how to write a c++ extension by any means,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSzE2bGdpYlVqNndjX0dzUG5wZE5aeUNPOVpfeUZXd296OEpNRndtSmtpSkJLQzdRSllER3A3d29nV0Y2Z3dWR0hKVXFlTjJZcnhwVzRyZjlLNmhxT09mXy14d3BEalQtNlpydUZadTlQYk09

thank you very much were currently busy looking through our evolved architectures to find more interpretations weve for example seen networks splitting a tensor along a specific dimension of the input that corresponds to signals from different sensors that might need to be processed differently we called it einspace as we started out very inspired by the generality of the einstein notation for many of the operations we were looking at and from using libraries like einops the name stuck when we expanded the set of operations as we just really liked it and it signifies a unified search space from the german ein=one,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvRGxDbUZaeHRYZnpOY3FGWmZHeTV1Yld5VGQtc1RUN2hJekJMMXQtSkhyMklkNlVSNWlhQUEtZnVaUFJGeGJNdHkxVi1DS3hxaFExZUVBQVNNUjJIRkZEajRleVdMYmlxLW1peG1TTVlpdFE9

thats a good point i really wanted the book to be geared toward upandcoming researchers and established ones yet i also wanted the room to explore the expansive nature of the topic a paper while valuable would be more concise and may not have been the best medium to do an extensive and thorough examination of all of the aspects and nooks and crannies of the topic if you will readers of different backgrounds and varying levels of expertise could appreciate the intricacies and possibilities that vector neural networks offer that doesnt mean i wont consider the possibility it has amazing resilience to variations in input data where i was able to zero out large swaths of input data and the network was still able to classify successfully with an ocr task it showed remarkable ability to learn after only seeing <number><number> examples of training data processed where a scalar network with many more parameters took much longer with financial time series prediction using the expanding vgru it was able to avoid catastrophic forgetting which plagued a traditional gru,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVEtIMkJFSlpfM1ZsSXdLMnZKZkx2RF9WenpwMzRqVTBjcUtTUEk3TTM5bEFPazFxSkI5STY4SUd5R29uSmNDd3kxcVo1c1JYX1EzbjliV09nQ2hUZnc9PQ==

while there are conceptual similarities the vnn takes it a step further by incorporating vectorbased operations and geometric biases directly into the learning process which enables the network to efficiently handle tasks that involve spatial and rotational invariance additionally the expanding vgru introduces a dynamic and adaptive approach to processing timeseries data that lets the network grow and optimize its spatial configuration based on the input received at each time step i performed a study where i systematically removed a certain component and tested the network again and each component like vector decomposition learned angles vectorbased matrix multiplication selfattention and multiple processing paths all played a role in the performance of the network you can get the best of both worlds by applying multihead attention to a vectorized network and get performance benefits of course,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvbFg2Y1kxNk5RY3ZlUUtxc1FHUGk4UWNKdGJrZ01MYzFVaERZc1VDRmQxYlNTOUlXX3dTN0taSnNwYXBwU2VWeC1qbWxMbFNSLVQ3cjNJWUhTY0huOFE9PQ==

well maybe another way to think about it is like this there are have to be people who are paid to maintain the libraries pytorch jax etc that most data scientists andor ai engineers depend on and those people have to be much more familiar with c++ cuda and with optimizing cuda kernels for speed than the average data scientist there are definitely jobs nvidia is hiring a bunch of engineers for this right now in fact where the main focus is working on cuda drivers and other lowlevel work if thats the kind of thing you enjoy that may be the kind of work you want to pursue longterm as in any ecosystem people specialize and many layers of the ecosystem depend on others part of the purpose of developing tools is to ensure that other people who may not share an interest in lowlevel optimization dont have to know anything about lowlevel optimization to get their work done without the ecosystem of python libraries for ml most of which are basically python wrappers on c++ code its highly unlikely that ml would have reached its current level of popularity in fields as diverse as bioinformatics physics and data science because most bioinformaticians and physicists dont really want to write their own c++ code to do backprop for example theres nothing wrong with powerful tools enabling people from outside the field to build their own solutions its part of the purpose of developing tools but if you already know at this point that you prefer developing tools to using them that may be helpful in deciding what direction you want to go in and what kinds of jobs you want to look for,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvUU9oMFFvSi1GcDl5QTRnazIza2tIVkZTRGJoakQ1dy14YlE2RE96RjYteUwyNHhIVjlEcFJQZGFWeUxpVlRuLU5LVUhDSml2QUw0WkZUeTRPZVE5alZZdFdlVjJMSjE4bDlGcS12TzFJUzg9

if you are optimizing for gpucuda essentially none but in the cpu world it is as fast aseven faster than cpp depending on use caseskill level it can be bound to python as easily has a better stack ie helpful compiler good package manager etc and easier to break into if you have only done python so far which does not apply to you but important point for me yet i think i will go with cpp as my second language because of gpu and wider usage in ml i remain rustcurious though,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvT2ZXWXh0OXV2VHVSUm1yUVlPbXduRi1LT3A1dTk0UUVuSHVQOXcwMGFkVUF0djdQZWFiVEt6Tk0tdXlmcDdZTlZVQTdUR3FzMlFJVXJWVngteWRSQVE9PQ==

so for example with the vectorbased matrix multiplication you have two matrices of <number>d vector neurons you apply matrix multiplication like you normally would except you first convert the pair of <number>d vectors into cartesian x and y coordinates you then subtract the two vectors you take that result then you convert it to polar then you scale the magnitude by the learned weight then you have your result like normal matrix multiplication you do a summation but with this you would do a vector summation by converting each of the vectors to cartesian and adding them up then you convert the result back to polar so if you have an nxm matrix times an mxm matrix where both are matrices of vectors you end up with an nxm matrix of <number>d vectors the conversions enhance the learning of the network,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYlppVVNwX3R3TlB2Q0NjdW05VVRIdThXUUtXSjhSUFIwOURFenJQdXRFTF9lRUwxRHg1cC1VVlY5VjRiR0J2VUFoOE5nUDM1UVQySGhtU2g1M3YxSkE9PQ==

its true that they have not been adopted much so far however traditional point cloud networks often rely on scalar operations and transformations which may not fully capture the geometric relationships and spatial dependencies inherent in point cloud data by incorporating vector operations and geometric transformations directly into the learning process the vnn architecture aims to provide a more intuitive and efficient way of handling point cloud data the use of geometric tensors vector decomposition and vectorbased matrix multiplication in vnns allows for a more direct encoding and manipulation of spatial and rotational information this could lead to improved performance and generalization in such tasks furthermore the expanding vgru component of the vnn architecture introduces a dynamic and adaptive approach to processing sequential point cloud data enabling the network to optimize its spatial configuration based on the input received at each time step this could potentially address some of the challenges faced by existing point cloud networks in terms of handling varying point densities and capturing longrange dependencies if you have any alternative theories please let me know,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvRzVlaURvRGlndkcyNGdTMEhZeGJZOW4tRXBoOGJ3djdzQk1Xb2xZZ2NVdk9SZTJqc0NmU1daYkxWQUNLVTZrNDVXRWpBRWtXODEtWExUZGJ1Wk4zY1E9PQ==

i believe that the vnn architectures ability to directly encode and manipulate geometric relationships through vector operations and geometric tensors can still provide benefits in terms of expressiveness and generalization even if rotational invariance is not the primary focus the vnn architecture aims to capture and leverage the inherent geometric structure of the data which can be valuable in tasks beyond just rotational invariance also in the context of the vnn architecture i was referring to the processing of point cloud data that evolves over time or has a temporal component for example in applications like d object tracking or motion analysis the point cloud data may change from one time step to another forming a sequence of point clouds,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvUnpFLVNyUmFpcXVodFFRdjhYRVB5QUQ3STM1eElPYktuNTgwSHBNVlNNSXI2RHVKQVY2dXBrdzA5bExlUktha3hGcXFlVzl5SDdKYlpKSzBSaVNQc3c9PQ==

yup thats a good question coiled definitely supports moving files between your local machine and the remote vm you can use file to upload filesdirectories to the cloud machine or sync to enable bidirectional file syncing between your current directory and the cloud vm both of those options are useful for small files for example a directory of python modules or small models but will be really slow when moving lots of data around i usually see training data or models especially when theyre large kept in cloud storage then you can use tools like sfs<url> or aws cli or other equivalents on gcp azure to access the data files from within your code something like import sfs s = sfssfilesystem sgetsmybuckettraindata traindata copy data from cloud storage,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdEM4THNnVlUtdjBIZFY5aVdMM18tZk51LXJFTUVwOGxPSDFKUWtwZFd4ZWRtOHg5ZEE5OHotRVoxcmhSMWp4UEE2VlJaNlM0WThrQlhCSDkxQWNqSGc9PQ==

not really why do you ask if i sparked your curiosity regarding the potential of vector neurons then i did my job the untapped potential definitely excites me so im glad it exudes in case anyone was wondering the next thing ill be working on is a vcnn for chess prediction so basically a valphazero since you can represent piece relationships via vectors it seems like a natural fit and i would use vectorbased learned filters for each move and well see how that goes also for natural language processing i was thinking of using multiple <number>d vectors as word or subword embeddings where i would use hierarchicalconstrained triangulation the main idea is to use <number> anchor points and three <number>d vectors emanating from those anchor points they would be constrained to intersect such that they represent a specific point on a <number>d map i would then do this hierarchically to pinpoint a location on a <number>d map starting from high above and then zooming down through multiple zoom levels the vectors would pinpoint a word or subword the vectors of course would be learned such that the result would be interpretable embeddings for an nlp task whats great about vectors is the creativity that you can put into your architectural designs,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVGE3LU5jdUxvTENESksxQk8xX3R1blBYOXJuTVZyYld0RHg2eWxqX0R0MWFVRV9UQTkzU1psU2FxcUpldk5DYUhldmpVNEJDZXNLYnU3ZE9fc0RNYVE9PQ==

in my experience this is a pointless exercise it is better to just pick a set number of results and always return that many it also makes things easier to manage on the frontend if you start choosing distancesimilarity thresholds then it can get really difficult to ensure that no query will return too many results to the frontend much moreso than if you simply return the top n every time from a user perspective people very rarely go past the first page of results as well they either find what they were looking for on page <number> or try a new query as a result i think it is always best to just return enough results to populate a few pages on the frontend is there some sort of application requirement that is forcing you into doing this if you absolutely must then i think a good approach would be to do candidate selection prior to calculating your distances and ranking that way you can always just return all candidates in sorted order and it should always be smaller than your entire index if you use reasonable selection method additionally all of those candidates should be relevant to the query at least somewhat lastly it would improve your search speeds this would solve your returning only relevant docs requirement but you would still have the issue of needing some sort of constant number of results to return to avoid transferring too much data to the frontend,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvczNwcDAxYXVEdmJJQW9WUEpNRkRnZnlueEdvZmNsOEZWN1VsWUloanFtb25EcDJEY2N5UmRZbktWbnRQajEybjlsNjRlR2Zhc05HczBWV2RnUTVLVWc9PQ==

first thanks for doing the analysis and taking the time to do some experimentation the results were quite interesting that said i do wonder how applicable the results are to the real world this particular use case is quite limited a pretty restricted set of classes fixed lighting etc ie things that play well into a smallersimpler network but dont necessarily reflect realworld challenges that would break the smallersimpler networks smallersimpler will naturally run faster and require less training but also have more poor results in more challenging circumstances maybe im missing something but that was my kneejerk reaction,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvTEhHTnV5U0FIa1pIRzUwQjl3Vkd3dktpeC0ybmktckZfanc0T3FzTjBidkNkNTJVcEZxS0dFRTRrdlptdmFWVnFuMzBvdU1ybWgwVUR4RDZvREpja2c9PQ==

thanks for the feedback id like to clarify some of the points you bring up we do show pareto fronts of sparsity vs performance in figs <number> <number> and <number> for the post training pruning setup we include resnet and a vision transformer with results on tinyimagenet to show how bmrs works on larger models and a more challenging dataset this in addition to using datasets and models such as mlps lenet fashion mnist cifar etc is in line with other work in the bayesian pruning literature see eg <url><url> <url><url> <url><url> the tables arent cherry picking single points as you mention the tables show the results of continuous pruning bmrs automatically selects what to prune after each epoch there is no hand selection or cherry picking of thresholds it is determined using either eq <number> or <number> prunes those structures and then training continues because the selection is automatic compression vs accuracy curves dont make sense in this setup which is why figs <number> <number> and <number> show posttraining pruning results where we plot compression vs accuracy and highlight the pruning threshold automatically determined by bmrs additionally every experiment is run across multiple seeds and meansstddevs are reported as for undertuning we use pretrained models for resnet and vit and finetune on the downstream datasets for cifar and tinyimagenet for <number> epochs i agree with the point that undertuning could change the compression vs accuracy characteristics of the method we can look into if further hyperparameter tuning could yield higher base accuracies for these settings finally the point of the work isnt to achieve sota and we dont claim to the contributions are the derivations and empirical results demonstrating the automatic selection of good pruning thresholds under bmr which maintain accuracy i hope this helps clarify some of these points,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwTWQ5VTQwWnY5WTVha1Y1OVl3LTlXUWhtdU5iN1dXOWNrTWhwVHMzQ3B6QnNlSEZ4UGYzOXVUUWZSX1lSWk5aMnZDQ0dMYkgwZUZzMlRLbVppZ05VcGc9PQ==

well it depends what you expect the ai to do ive been looking into this and there are a few llms like youre describing evo caduceus agront and taskspecific deep learning projects <url> <url> my impression is that open source llms are at the stage where theyre demonstrating that llms technically can do the tasks which bioinformatics researchers use standard tools for a future llm could either be a tooluse project genegpt crisprgpt compare new proteins to familiar ones recent deepmind paper <url><url> or maybe take additional steps alphafold has gotten so far ahead of other approaches to protein folding that its truly groundbreaking landmark point for ai on uniprot a proteins database they always feature a visualization from alphafold and embeddings from a proteins model so those hold value legitimacy in this space,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwNkRWYzhwZEJGa2hxbE4xUktHcHRKUlFFMTA1X1Q5OTNxcHhnWS1SM3hKSTlJUFEyYWlSWGpkQS1GdkhjR0Z4cFJXaXNmSHJHZUhkczFPNUZFUFBfQXc9PQ==

yes it is basically the set of all linguistic data in an ehr hospitals still report a lot of information about patients in written notes as a result we lose this useful information to analyse and improve healthcare quality a good example are fall events up until recently hospitals apparently were very bad at tracking which patients encountered an inhospital fall event multiple studies showed that a hospitals estimate of these adverse events was approx <number> to <number> of those that happened in reality even though weve known for a long time how falling while being inpatient complicates the treatment it delays discharge and increases cost all this time all information was present in the ehr just very difficult to accurately extract weve done several attempts at building models that can classify patient notes on whether they describe a fall event or not while these models performed quite well they failed often at disambiguating whether a described fall happened during hospitalization or was the cause for it while it happened somewhere else as you can expect most of the fall mentions in clinical notes are about things that happened to patients outside out of the box llms such as gpt without any finetuning seem to outperform even our annotators when it comes to making this distinction so we can use llms to evaluate our dataset and to speed up annotation efforts by crosschecking annotations with the llms output in a sense computing an inter annotator agreement between a human and an llm im very interested in seeing how this way of converting the unstructured ehr data into verifiable structured data can be used for predictive analysis in all of healthcare,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwLVBwRUtoX0pxZTNhRDFIVzJaZndMV2s1VFNwbGZHR1l0YjZ3QVQzNENKbDR1eDFnalU1a2NYclI4WmlXWVIyUk01ZWxoNS1rQ3ZLb3pHTzlXZzdSWEE9PQ==

i think its import to distinguish between large language models and transformer models but this paper conflates the two large language models are really a method of model training you can use any model you want for inferring the next token in a sequence and transformer models just happen to be the most popular method for doing that transformer models by contrast can be used for solving many different problems and its not clear to me that they have deficiencies in multistep reasoning when trained in a different context what if you used a transformer for monte carlo tree search or for reinforcement learning people have had a lot of success with multistep reasoning in those contexts indeed i think its really not obvious that llms should be capable of robust multistep reasoning at all irrespective of the model used in implementing them it could very well be the case that training a model regressively by using a large number of curated examples of multistep reasoning can never be successful for reasons that have nothing to do with the implementation details of the model edit also i think it should go without saying that deep learning is also distinct from both transformers and large language models and that limitations of the latter two do not necessarily imply limitations of the former,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwZHlqNVZRaHdYeV9henNmNG8yd0IxYmFaZ0pwc0k0R0pGUExmVUczVmd0TG1YUnRIX2RZOXFrZmJ1VEdnVXVNY3NiSnRkUUdkZU5KcEFhYmRVenlCSHc9PQ==

i dont know about for image generation specifically but i think what youre referring to is known more broadly as neural operators whereas diffusion models learn an approximation of the vector field for a differential equation and then evaluate the time evolution operator by using numerical solutions of that differential equation you can instead learn the time evolution operator directly using neural operators vdm looks like its a special case of this i dont know a lot about the benefits of using neural operators but if its possible for a given use case i think there are good reasons to prefer learning the vector field instead training and modeling is probably easier and the solutions you end up with are probably more accurate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2ZkUwdEx0NWJGMm13a3hITE43NHRLY2NoeXBsYnk0Zk1yVk4wbGRaTHhDTjlPZGE0SGpWaVZSWk1SLUVHT1VWOVRqdW1aTW1RbnkxMHNnUjVNTjBkZlE9PQ==

to my understanding any work in the line of architecture modification will need to go for at least one of two routes to validately showcase its capability a trainfromscratch and compare to fully opensourced transformer baselines ie you can find training code data and even the ordering of them for this the baselines are often along the lines of pythia openllama llm etc b somehow adopt the weight of a pretrained llm to your new architecture and finetune it the tasks you are after are often ppl or accruracylike metrics on the pretrained corpus wikidata c hellaswag mmlu bbh humaneval gsmk etc i am not familiar with the ntoken prediction accuracy you are showing here and if my exposure is right this is likely not the norm for llm evaluation i think it is very unlikely youd have something good with on but hey nothing wrong with hacking around good luck and have fun,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2QzVEeVF4T2pjZTVnYzFnQVAzSVNObGNxaWR6RWdVWFczT2NpMjhJOEdBZ2Y5bTZKYTlreU0zQ0JqcE5vVEVYdHZWTWljbk9BYU9IdS1ZWURxT0NKQkE9PQ==

the regulation not innovation commentary truly misses the mark the reason why some ml models are not as popular is due to real constraints on the type of data in biostats the problem and the stuff that is associated on the patient health care outcomes side the dirty truth is that regulatory bodies tend to err on a side of robustness that most ml publications cant hold themselves too replication in ml journals is terriblewhich is surprising considering how many people here diminish the worth of other fields biostatistics has embraced ml methods or ai whichever you want to call it even though the only difference is marketing for certain use cases as expected however theres a rich history of over promise and under deliver from ml in say prognostic modeling even alpha folds success is much tamer than the headlines will show im not sure how well get super human agi from llms especially in this space when the training data is polluted with terrible modeling practices,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2NXNSTmg3T08wdTZBNEhNd2JTd2Jqc2E0M2J6eTlHR2lQVW9OOEswNjhpUFFuVjVzS1pCNjV1NE1mblNqQllnaXIzdjdsTFd2VE95MzVXdm1uemg0aHNrV1lacGpwX2R0WHo2ZGtmMXZ0YzQ9

if you think modern statistical theory isnt being leveraged here than youre more of a novice than i originally thought you cant say that stats evolved into ml and then ai statisticians gave us things like nns and trees decades ago most statisticians might not utilize them and most research in this space hasnt traditionally focused on it here because more general theoretical results take up most of their focus but these approaches leverage those findings stats didnt end at linear regression lol and hardly anyone in ml wants to tackle things like uncertainty propagation in ml models becausewell thats boring leave it to the statisticians we like to dunk on when its convenient statistics or more appropriately statistical learning is the big umbrella ml and ai live under,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TFRkYmNVMEJ1YnE1SEYxTEhiRlFBaWdVWkhibEd6cllERmhYTjBDa0ZzTmQyUnJIM0ZrRkE1aWJnUXBKMTVsMG02OVJObVpvcno5enZOYi10SFFCWENTb0tUZjVIUEhOU3JMNmhrb0hZbzg9

can you give me more instructions basically my model takes feature vector extracted via pretrained model for each sample and then predict frame wise labels that is my task but i want to get the sample wise class label by majority voting of the sequence to train a network i want a differentiator loss function for majority voting i can take mode but that is not working as a loss function that is what im struggling,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2dlZ4b0twNFk4bUYzS2hmUkNtRWRXV1ZYZVhvU25LXzBoUmRIVGxkaXZGNmpGNjdzMktRbDB2QWx2LW9jZVBlVjRsVTd1WEdpMDBsRGRlNG4zcHlhU3F6U2ZQbHZyZkljRTFNTTF0Q3Rhblk9

there are a number of different ways the easiest way would be to define your selection method manually this would be good if your queries are structured ie if your users querymetadata always contains a location you can prefilter the results and only rank the ones that are available in that location however since you stated that you dont have any sort of oracle similarity function i would imagine you cant easily define these rules if that is the case then the best way i can think of is to use an inverted index the exact implementation will depend on how your search index is implemented the simplest example i can think of that would work for a completely uncompressed index would be to only search results that contain at least one of the input tokens ie you would store some hashmap that has tokens as keys and lists of documents containing that token as values another example if your index is product quantized then you can rank only the results that share a centroid index in the same position as your quantized query,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2VWM0V3NUVVJIaXU4RVJ4QkJWa1F3ZlBkUGprSGdHeXBYcnhoYnllaVNwUmd3WXVuNE9yZ08xSVF2YjRvazAxZXM0ekNMR1JFbk94eGppZG1wYnZmWWc9PQ==

watch bluebrowns the essence of linear algebra series and also his videos on neural networks for the best visualization of backprop and other algorithmic steps ive seen statquest is usually a goto for stats videos which should be your bread and butter most educational video content for stats ive found to be very straight forward and leave me wanting so if anyone else has recommendations i would appreciate them as well bbs essence of calculus series is great too but really ive found beyond learning about the derivative partial derivative not much calculus is necessary for ml a lot of vsauce and veritasiums videos i find to be the most captivating and explain mathematical concepts how they were discovered and their impact better than any other but the math is usually a component of the story they tell rather than the focus and can be piecemail throughout their content,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2QzZZMm1XTV9XSTlHOEV6SGFTUEJ6Nk1hSndtNVlIQVNrdjRsaGZ3aDBMMktLUi1WcVFxaS1BeldzU051ZDI2Z1o0cG8wVTZQa2ItUmpKQXFxdFlrdkE9PQ==

my background is a little different im working almost full time in addition to doing phd but maybe it will be useful for you finishing my nd year of phd and i was also doing research in the same area before during masters i almost dont research literature apart from the current paper i mean i read papers before sleeping on the bus train etc but no principled literature search i do this only for the current paper after initial experiments at that phase when i think the idea should reasonably work i do proper literature search for <number><number> days overall this is probably around <number> of time for my phd but i also do this for fun since i like reading papers when i start doing experiments seriously for the current paper i try not to break them for other things i take leave at my work and i program for <number>+ hours i may do a little break to check literature if i need to also i often teach courses at the university and for student projects i often assign ideas i want to check out and im not sure if this will work out or not this is great for my time efficiency and also students can take part in research this way for learning things i also do this exclusively i take a course and i focus full time on it or rather in the afternoons after work this way i finish what i start much more often but this is for sure the least part in my phd in general i prefer to focus on one thing and work in intensive bursts this helps me to keep focus and its easier to manage time this way for me this may or may not work for you but almost all phd students that i know prefer and use this style of work granted most of them are also working in addition to the phd about your specific questions spending <number> on learning is too much in my opinion especially if you spend only <number> hours daily on phd for research you will probably learn more through reading papers and having papers to know and cite is very useful in itself just <number> hours on programming is also not much imo but this may depend on your area if your experiments are computationally costly and you often just wait for results this can be ok,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UVZUMnBjdjRab0MwWXpYc1ZBTV85dDR0X3g1bFdqcHQ0NEZiaWFwd1RER1JsOFRSZFFwbkxqbGtPaUZWV3lwNHd6blNQaXBxRUNCUGtGOXE1cmlTalE9PQ==

this doesnt make any sense to me lets say your goal is to explore a project that you want to be a conference paper this project will be something like a research problem or question first you need to nail down the rough idea to make it more concrete maybe written up as notes in an overleaf doc in this doc you may draft the paper abstract to understand the projects scope and then you understand the relevant literature and theory to implement your idea after that you focus <number> on implementing your idea derisking the idea as fast as possible this process may require iterating the idea and exploring more math and literature once the idea is derisked you go full steam ahead implementing additional features and running ablations and other experiments with a detailed logbook while experiments are running you may expand your notes and fill in the literature and theory gaps then when the experiments are finished you turn your notes into a conference submission and you can tidy it up where needed it makes no sense to me to stop the experiment phase because you have an allotted lit review time in practice if you have overlapping projects then these phases may be interleaved but they are very much projectorientated,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Y3NobmtaYkhIczcwSnZ2VHZNczBKTUpQVlVCT0gyUF8wV0RhVVpTY2hWY2xpcHIzTnNueUhCektIeEM0SUFEMG1lSXhKcWR3dE51cFdLUjNsMTNNUXc9PQ==

llm observability tools provide an sdk to log llm calls from your code or an llm proxy to intercept requests you can use the sdk to manually log inputsoutputs of llms and other steps like preprocessing or retrieval from a vector database some of these tools also provide function decorators in python to collect traces automatically and integrations with libraries like langchain or llamaindex through callbacks llm monitoring is about collecting visualizing and setting up alerts based on general metrics latency tokens cost or custom kpis evaluations you can create evaluations using functions you write yourself human scores or using llms as a judge you can use these evaluations to validate a new model on a curated dataset for example offline evaluations or run evaluations on production runs online evaluations for example you can use an llm with a specific prompt to evaluate llm generations and ask the llm to judge whether the generation on hallucinations toxicity context relevancy for rag applications or any criteria you think are useful so far i have only used one llm observability and evaluation platform literal ai<url> with the python sdk but there are many more langsmith from the creators of langchain langfuse honeyhive openllmetry based on opentelemetry,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2d2o1cEp6ZG1ZTlg3aG5HUjBUSXd2UkhDcWpxOWVhTDl3N3JYQTZCa1hxdmVLa1RZZkhod2hFUGJualFmaE9jNVlrRXpUbEhQak0xcDBHVkxSNmY0MHc9PQ==

wow after an initial read this looks solid i wonder however what the caveat is it looks like in the overparametrized regime some things just dont matter anymore transformers have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to pruning quantization etc maybe being matmul free considerably decreases this wiggle room or performance on downstream tasks sucks edit also props for showing off an fpga implementation which is where matmul free deep learning could really shine,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Um1PN2N6dDZ3OHVHVGNWOGM5UkhuNWNqeUs4RHJUT0dEZW8wbFYzNnZucDRqYXFPR3JJenB3MEZGT05jUW84QktEcmRka3paNVFvU2laZGZJTTJLN2c9PQ==

spending time on maths and literature should be done like course work like few hours per week with concrete outcomes for literature review outcomes could be checking in what capacity your current idea has been tried and what were the results similarly for maths stats things like ability to check proofs solving related problems on your own etc however major chunk of your time should be devoted to ideation implementation and quick results in that order review your approach regularly through peer feedback meeting advisor etc to pivot quickly if things are nit heading in good direction you will fail <number> times to come up with <number> success more you delay this process slower and outdated your reserch will become,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2dnhqYm9DVlAtUnZVN21keUlKT2ZLZ1pKcEtkblJwUU5GcVNtX0E4RVlidWhnSW03N1FGZHdud2JSU2F1VlhaSi02M1o0cFhqaWJNR1VYS0F3WmdiSktPQk9YUG9kbUJ1cmVlQjd1NkNDUE09

i think for a firstsecond year phd student focusing on the basics math and whatever and learning the literature is never a waste of time a lot of people end up doing shoddy pointless or halfbaked research because they havent accumulated enough of the fundamentals to be able to know what is worth researching and what isnt some people even produce research results that have been know in other fields for decades because they just dont know enough about what theyre studying id drop your <number> hours dedicated to developing research hypotheses altogether and reallocate that to literature review at least for now let novel research ideas be something that comes to you passively as you read other peoples papers as you learn more you should start to have research ideas that other people have already executed and written papers on some students find this frustrating but it is actually an indication that you are starting to understand enough that you can know what is worth researching eventually youll start having ideas that nobody has tried before and thats how you know youre at the cutting edge structuring your time is good but dont get too attached to planning true research as opposed to development is inherently unpredictable youll have long periods of apparently little progress interspersed with brief intervals of incredible progress that occur when you figure out how to unravel a new part of a problem that youve chosen to solve,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2ajhTLVFxanZBS2hjdmRKYVNycUtIRXFLMWNvTi1Cdm1IVDJTT2VLU2U1R3ZvanM1NDk1bENIN1pGUlJUeElueWpBUkl4VmZjWTJOV09KaW9LeUVrVnc9PQ==

both approaches work with their pros and cons but it all boils down to what metrics you are trying to optimize and what business goal you aim to achieve however without a better understanding of the business context your suggested approach does seem like a more natural fit because multiple faults can occur simultaneously also in terms of data utilization the one multilabel model can be more efficient since it can leverage knowledge gained from other faults to identify rare faults for which you have fewer samples in the training data finally managing a single model can lead to reduced complexity but why not just try it if your boss is prepared to train <number> models then training one more shouldnt be a problem as a pilot you could make <number><number> separate models then make another joint model for the same ones to see which approach is more promising,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TEwyU01zWWx3aVRQdDBVbjQ1OF9GbWxselI4ZHBXYzB6d2pacEdFcklucG5uMEs2QUU5d3VKODE5SjBuSmRZQXNqQnpfRjNsbWpKNW5hMDhRTjF2b1E9PQ==
the key to success is low expectations nobody leaves an undergraduate program as an elite with a profound understanding of anything you should accept that you wont understand the contents of most papers at your level reading papers is mostly about understanding the structure of research papers identifying and understanding their goals and understanding whether and why their final results show that they have accomplished their goals if you can do all of that then youre in a very good place also know that part of the difficulty of understanding papers is that a lot of them are genuinely not good this is especially true in machine learning the logical justification for research methods is often hand wavy or even just wrong and most authors arent good at explaining what theyve done results are frequently contextualized poorly incorrectly or misleadingly a lot of published papers probably most are mostly pointless fyi if youre thinking of getting an industry job as an mle then the most important skill is software development not understanding cutting edge research mles are really just regular software engineers who also know a bunch of math,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2VE8xeUlFN3pCbzJxTHRsTDNiSlQyN3c5ajBaSVJRUnl3Wm15V3hnai1KQWtpcUtUNzhBWWNRT2VUdW51X1ZQMEpFV09IenFiTHI4TTV5VU9OYUl1VFE9PQ==

question can faults in one assembly lead to faults in another or even worse can one assembly send bad output to other parts or assemblies without triggering fault detection and then the fault propagates downstream where it does get detected if so your approach is much more appropriate if everything is completely independent from each other then your bosss approach while inefficient is valid too edit id like to see how a cnn with faultno fault output so if <number> assemblies <number> binary outputs which you then sum up to find of faults would do in your project,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TDlUNjhRUUxLTzJFVzJiNXFzT0J5eWw5akowTGpMRUVxMlRqVEl4eS1hMVJTTGFVQktMbTU3WmdmUjlGRGR3R1JEM0J6eVhVTnV4TDMzUjV5bWJITFE9PQ==

every mutlilabel classification problem is solved by using multiple models sometimes it just seems like theres only one model because all of the actual classification models are very simple and most of the computation consists of working with features that are shared by all models i agree with your instinct to keep the code simple you can probably write just a single feature engineering pipeline and use a single model that model can have multiple <number> outputs or it can have a single output and simply be trained <number> times for <number> different labels aside from performance issues these things are basically equivalent your models wont be huge so hard drive space isnt an issue and the code for each model is identical so youre not making things complicated regarding this > i think it is ignoring the fact that one dataset can have two or three faults and when training for one fault labelling all others the same as you would label normal data might be misleading in some way for the sake of simplicity and ease of maintenance you probably do want to label all faults for every dataset assuming thats easy to do this will allow you to have a single data structure for your labels that is shared by all datasets which will make your model training code simple and reusable youll ultimately need that unified label data structure at some point before training so the only question is where in the feature pipeline you end up putting it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2YXo4cVc5Zzh0bXAwQWhuNDZsZDVweEhSN1hfX0p2TFplWDZVYlhGSFZnRTVyRUpHc0lBTXZHaTg3RlRtbzZ0X3NHLWFRUmhqZDg4UEF1OExuc1RaQUE9PQ==

>the most important thing so far is the precision anything that detects the maximum faults do you mean recall precision would mean i have very few false positives among the faults that i signal with high scores in the model if its recall as the problem suggests then a basic binary classifier of is there any fault might be the most powerful and reliable youre inevitably dealing with a rare positive situation and those historical ground truth positives are precious and you need the model to use them as well as possible without overfitting spending model parameters to distinguish among the fault types may be less valuable diffusing the small number of historical positives among different modelsparameters is less desirable and may lower overall detection performance it is probably likely in the underlying engineering and physics that faults are not entirely independent the cause of the faults have underlying and so merging their classes isnt inappropriate a physician will use multiple syndromes and is trying to discern for instance is there any heart disease vs a specific observable phenomenon the other likely reality is that normal operation is probably well stereotyped and narrowly behaved while faults are outliers or unexpected regime shifts i would consider trying to make unsupervisedselfsupervised models on known good behavior only whether static in some space or predicting some time step ahead distributions of observations like llmsthen use their scores quantifying how surprising current reality is as inputs to the supervised faultdetection model for operational use you might want a second smallsimple model conditioned on a positive fault to distinguish among the classes that might be as simple as linear or naive bayes and can signal multiple conditions as well youll be training this only on the positives and so simple small is good and the problem might be simple too,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TmdaVm11bGFyZ0NTcHFHdVJZUzJjMEttRUN0VVBZZFQtMm1hUGZhN0lHMlJ3WDFPRzZma2RzcVhIZVNrN1U2cEpidmhjZE5fZmNyMVE3QjE5SkFPZUE9PQ==

yeah it feels very much like an emperor wearing no clothes situation theres no incentive for anyone to admit that a lot of derivations are some combination of superfluous wrong or incomprehensible that last one is especially tricky in a field with so much money celebrity and posturing people dont feel comfortable admitting when they dont understand something i dont think that field immaturity has a lot to do with it though i think this is really just symptomatic of how unimportant most papers are if your results are really good or novel then you dont need elaborate derivations in order to impress people,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ZzRnSVpIZk9uR1hIMlgyTHhOc2JKY0M5cGVBNk5lallIamVOUk9oWG0yc0VMdkk1ZVhQZXgxQkV0ZUJGTUlWMnV3dERvTDhYenNJUGVULXNaT2s1ZGc9PQ==
its definitely not ideal and for sure carries the risk of fitting your model to processes that have changed since that time for eg if you use the holdout set for early stopping or parameter searches why not train the model on the older data and test on the newer data to be honest its not exactly clear which one would be better you could try doing it both ways implement both send live predictions from the one you think will probably be best and switch to the other one if you were wrong,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ck5JTDBsUUNIZDhadkVwSU01WmYyR3JVZXNjVFZIOGVhNENNYS1kUkpib09ub0ZDMTgyWDZDblJOMlBsOEdkR2lTaU1wdDcxN2c3aE1GZ05rYzluaHNyVS1pZmYzbEhWaTNQNXg4R0xMTHc9

i think its an important distinction to make for people doing industry mle work especially if software like xgboost is on the table people who are kind of new to the job often arent aware that most of the actual work consists of feature engineering not modeling as such neural networks are certainly one option and if the only thing you do is use a neural network then yeah a single model is the most intuitive picture but op might find that neural networks arent the best option for the model or that the most effective thing to do is use neural networks for some of the feature engineering and then tree models for the final classification this is especially important for the data engineering because sometimes its more effective from an infrastructure perspective to precalculate a bunch of features separately and then feed them all into a bunch of independent models in a separate process,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Y2sxUk9KRjhRSGNyZ0pZbU1VLUxLOVo5eUUtR2p4WlBuZ1BIUENFV3hPdnctWUtvNzBpdXVzTTh1YTF6UkpJTy1SYjBGS0xNQS1hMGhGcTlqUjV6SFE9PQ==

go ahead and try but i bet what would be most effective is to use real images as training data either on their own or in addition to your synthetic data assuming your synthetic data had halfway decent performance against the real data i think you need to ask yourself why are you using synthetic data is it because you spent a bunch of time coding up the solution to generate it is it because real data is hard to get if your synthetic training data doesnt get you at least halfway decent performance its probably time to consider abandoning it so what is the performance using your synthetic only data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ZFFXSGktMFUzVWRWRDVBMUhUdGRMWE1SU1U3Wjd3SnhNLTZWMWdFOE9yZnowRHVqM3lEcmhraUpIZHIyRzNJNEpEWE5ya1R3cU9aLTAyVk5reHQta1E9PQ==

so this is kind of a complicated issue its somewhat well known that fault detection isnt exactly a perfect match for offtheshelf multiclassification in the simplest terms theres a way in which fault detection is more like a maximum over multiple elements or issues rather than an addition of contributing terms there are instances where one sample might have a higher fault activation distributed over multiple faults which is ok but another sample with a lower total fault activation all concentrated into one specific issue is faulty simple applications of softmax and sigmoid arent entirely sufficient to describe this you can find circumstances where this cannot be figured out by a sumoverweightedfeatures overall i think your boss strategy is lowerbias and will allow for this kind of analysis meaning you can take the output of many models and manually apply a maximum in a way that a neural network literally cannot learn there are endtoend models that can work around this constraint specifically ones where you literally use the maximum function but this isnt just a throw the right layer in and itll work kind of thing you should really be digging into the semantics of each category and each category about every other in order to lay out what kind of logic is allowed to connect your models latent representation to your specific categories and also what kind of error signals you should and should not be processing for example if the target category is n=<number> you might want to ignore the error from n=<number> to n=<number> thats something youd have to build into a custom loss function probably but really there are some hard constraints about how long it will take to train a model to check out a new hypothesis but on that last point in many circumstances you can be working in training a network is a test of a hypothesis not a way to get a source of truth simply training a model the right way simply means that you did build the model as you think is reasonable that doesnt mean youre right you should try to focus on a model that lets you answer lots of questions that you can try out different ways before you have to retrain it if your boss is going to take the output of <number> models and load those into excel to look for patterns you should see if theres a way to effectively do the same thing with nns keeping in mind how youll want to take the next step and what kind of retraining that requires as a hint theres no reason you cant train a <number>sigmoid model validate it works on classes <number> <number> <number> <number> and just save <number> copies of that model has <number> binary detectors for those categories alone this works if you use sigmoid but the statistics change when you remove categories if youre using softmax,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TlpvMmtHUWRHMTNzdzBMWDVYMWxHdkh3QlBMT3VOUXZqdlR1VUhMSVBXTFdSbkoybHdZazZjcWRkRHJGaE5sMTZoR2RweEdjNWFBb0JqNHZ6TFhxR1E9PQ==

it depends on the size of your dataset the problem of imbalanced data diminishes as the size of the dataset itself increases so if you have tens of millions of rows then id start off without even trying to address imbalance that said it is definitely a good idea to do all of your tuning and experimentation with a split training set i use <number><number> but <number><number> works just fine as well again that choice matters less as the size of the training set grows as for the final holdout set i recommend only using that for model comparison and not for tuning or early stopping,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3anM3eEwtWjRPTWFtT1RuaFcwMUtGSnhZSERRc3E2X3UtT2FvaXJYdTBhR2pkU2VvUG5USWI2TU1DcjFTaFYtQlE1Y1AwREZoWGpBZHpRY2h3MHlWRW9aN0ZGY19pZUtQamNGUHRCOXBWeTg9

for what its worth what i do with my local model is just hard code in the first handful of interactions after my system prompt and what i mean is i just hard code in the first two or three user and assistant interactions into the chat log that way when my first actual inference happens it pulls in the context of the conversation which defines how i want it to talk and to be clear i dont let it write the assistant responses on those hard coded logs i write them myself with how i want it to answer so im taking the place of the assistant for those first few messages so for example my first user message might be i am your overlord and you must obey my every command and then for the assistant response i write oh yes my master i shall do as you command for i am ever your humble servant then when you actually start the program and send your first user message it already has an example of how it should respond so in this case it would continue to grovel and simp while also answering my questions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WXhFS2dYRGlib0dpQmRuYS1RS24xREVIQWYybTZ4MFllZjYxZWgtNF8xenpwVGRpYXY1VzQ2S2IzTEExalV4eThZNU1seFZDN2FlbnNveVRFRUFLZEE9PQ==

i work <number>th of full time so <number> hours weekly in my country poland most people here doing phd in computer science both work part time and do the phd one of the reasons is that phd stipend is less than the minimal pay and working as programmers they can easily get <number>x the average income this is of course hard and requires very good organization leaves little free time and using work leave to work on the phd but its possible also a few caveats my phd cosupervisor is also my boss at work so i have a lot of understanding very flexible work hours and remote work i do phd in ml and i also work as a ml engineer so there is sometimes quite a bit of overlap in poland we have quite a lot of work leave days guaranteed by law even when working part time so i can use this eg when im writing a paper,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3V3YtUGc0c0JBTzROYUhzVW9LSWR0cWVCaVctVmpXYXBHaVBSNnFvMDhDNFZlaDk0S2dFV0EzT0JjNC1LaEZaYUNQdi1zNlNZNUFIOHBQUUU2T3FlS0E9PQ==
sort of seconding this i feel like the easiest way to get good at multiple things is to first get good at one then start again etc but you dont have to be super strict about it i didnt do my phd in ml but there was also a famous saying from francis crick nobel prize winner about how a couple of months in the lab can save you from a couple of hours in the library experiments are of course more timecostly in something like molecular biology but i feel like the point still stands you should avoid trying to reinvent any wheels the best you can and having a grasp on what has been invented already or what didnt work and why in your field is the only way to do this so papers and or discussions with supervisor and other academics is excellent use of your time in general also socialize with your peers itll both teach you a lot and youll make helpful networks and you know youll get friends,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UE0xNm9uMDdTNXVvNDVXOWRVWEhtVlRabTl4Y0dPMDR6V3dBWkRBNkZXaFVSYjc1QWloN3JuWnRza0RWdDc4bTlQNU54M0ZBQng1RHlWWmVVNVZma1E9PQ==

one thing to keep in mind for the multilabel approach if your labels are incomplete ie there are some dataset items that have truefalse labels for some fault classes but no label for other classes or most importantly if such data may be collected later on from feedback it can be a better idea to train individual classifiers sure there are ways to still train multilabel models eg multi task models or by pseudolabeling the missing classes from heuristics previous model iterations genai or even from individual classifiers but unless oyure really optimizing for compute during inference it may be easier to just go with the individual classifiers or is it possible that some classes are added later on could it be that some classes need a ot more data than others and that it is cheaper to just label for those classes that said if youre sure that items will always have labels for all classes i agree with the multilabel idea,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UVltQUtSYmZlc3cxdDlmWVdzWGs5S3poc0dGZG1MYWVuS1pHTjJBUXlZRHZDcFNXMUFMR09Pelh2OWwzN2hqcVEzN3VMTTRHdEhIRUM0YlZlSi1wYnc9PQ==

from what i understand which is humbly little training for multiple tasks tends to create more robust models assuming you got the data taking the kinds of faults as multiple tasks id bet training one model to rule them all would be better the downside is if one task is lagging youd have to finetune everything which might result in other tasks taking a hit but that could in theory be rectified by separating the models later edit depending on the types of errors you expect you might have thresholding issues where a lot of subcomponents malfunction just a bit but overall the system is malfunctioning might want to have another output for a wholesystem ok signal for that,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YTBKVEZzOEtCZ3FTNnRWV1AtVUJzT2h5Z215em5Fd2poQ3YxRW82Nk1vVDd6MEp0YW5kNnZ1YlBtSkNqZDB1VlhPNG1BV0tuX2N1ZWItNWVuWm04MGJQbEJaNGlNc1Q4MjhUbGcxUkFBQ1k9

i agree with your colleague no reason really to separate these two tasks assuming you have sufficient data it should also be pretty easy to generate leetspeak and obfuscated versions of your toxic words a user can only be so creative with their obfuscation and still have others understand what they actually wanted to type the only thing you will need to be careful with is that you should have lots of obfuscated nontoxic examples so that the model doesnt learn that obfuscation=toxic one other method is to use a simple dictionary that can map leetspeakobfuscated ngrams for their correct english versions prior to feeding them into the toxicity model this would step around the issue of having to identify whether a piece of text is obfuscated in the first place and it would be very simple and fast to perform the substitutions even if you dont get this perfect i imagine it would still be quite good and definitely the easiest approach to implement by far however i think the former method would be more robust,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UFFFellrM3RhZU1MMC1vUkxfMldET0dfNUhucG9ERGh2QnVxZTBBaEVJOVlPRVVUWTlwSFNDNE83ekdMNzJqb2RYZ2p5QU00OW1EeXdQRWI4ZFM0VUE9PQ==

uwatsns i feel your statement is true but not exactly the reason of the saving if you agree y is weight but not activation even in full ft ys grad is only used for update y so it will not have any impact on the rest of backprop anyway think about the example above y is frozen which is likely to be a big matrix and the key here is y will not be updated in lora only x which is much smaller than y then during backprop ys grad is not needed or saved in memory as it will not be updated anyway only xs grad is needed ys value is used to compute that essentially we are skipping a large grad computation of y but replace it with a much smaller computation of grad of x insread just my <number> cents,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Rm9WZnRwS1o3bmZOZTN5Zzl5M2xOam9sVWtsamtWV2xCaE9jQllfc1lfeWlJQ3BFYi1tNXViOEtGNl9aUnNJRy1zSUNYaEsyWlNCVjV2eC1qSW1TSFE9PQ==
you can get used to reading papers by looking though them and skipping over the parts that seem too daunting then as you read more and more papers those daunting areas become less so in the beginning start by looking at the results or if you feel like you have an idea of what the ai paper is about look at the architecture figure and try to understand it in your own way then supplement this by reading the section regarding it as you become more accustomed to the language and terms used in these papers you might start reading more than just the architecturemethodology sections but i would say that you can typically get a good grasp of a paper just by looking at the images graphs and result tables i rarely read a paper from end to end dont be afraid of skipping parts that you just dont get yet i wasnt able to understand the probability theory behind vaes until recently but i have implemented many from the ground up often you do not need to know the exact derivation or theory behind a model to implement it some concepts will be hard to understand but as you stumble upon papers that describe or use the same terms you will be able to contextualize and understand them better it also helps if you try to implement the papers methods yourself from the ground up but this adds an additional burden of getting used to pytorch the most important part to understanding research is to think about the methodology and relate it to other papers or theory that you know and to constantly think about how you would implement use or improve it yourself,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3RjZXMGJMMGJaS1hvMlhETWZmTzROTXBKOGtXbXhMbVBmMG8wVFVVUS1PVnhvQVdnQjJmTlhoMUNJc0YxcnlnaTVWNDZzeGl6aVBXdWR4VjR2VHZHOHc9PQ==
pytorch lightning significantly improves the pytorch experience by abstracting away a lot of the training boilerplate in addition to making it very easy to switch to mixed precision training or distributing over multiple gpus their mildly opinionated set of choices are all pretty much spot on and provide all of the kind of training structure you might want for the most part i think in typical ml contexts strongly recommend,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3azB5UkMyMFlkMVNjU2NFYzFQTUJLWWJvVDAtRmU0S1AyQWxhZzJSR1Rpc0FISkJzT3dudERINjNWWmh2QTd2am14WENIdHRyRkpZY1JUb2cwbklQU3U4eTJUVkRfUFRuY2Y3cnRPb2VZVU09

in my tests tflite has been much more consistently fast than pytorch mobile i could write everything in pytorch and then do a pt > onnx > tf > tflite conversion to export a model but for most use cases the difference in working between those two frameworks isnt big enough to justify using pytorch if the main deliverable is a model thats running on a wide array of mobile devices also someone said that tfrecords are annoying to work with while that is true once its set up and working its amazing how fast they are even working with pytorch if im worried my data loader will be slow small model w large inputs preprocessing slowshared storage networked storage multi nodes i still use tfrecords in pytorch if youre just getting into things and want to spend some time to get good i would definitely suggest pytorch if you just want to yolo a few small projects use keras <number> and dont worry about the backend until youre doing something interesting but that being said a lot of places still use tf in production it may not be the future but its a long way from dying,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MzdYZkJ1R0FBQWUwWDFUYXNDeFlJUXlONk44VkQtWlBOcjRWMzJrNlRtMHFEZFNxaHd4Z2RucXJlU0dwWkQ1TlNCejJTN1dmTUpVMFdtRmRlMU95TEE9PQ==

reddits filters arent allowing me to post for some reason so ill try putting it here im attending cvpr for the first time this year by myself and i could use some guidance on how to navigate well everything but particularly with the initial preparationresearch phase first and foremost how do you view all the accepted papers i know theres a page from a link on the home page that lists the accepted papers but only like half of them actually have links and there arent much in the way of details aside from the paper name and authors like what category it belongs under or what org its associated with and theres this new interactive page which looks spiffy but im finding it to be incomprehensible not only do i not understand what the numbers on the page represent and the graphics associated with the categories but it doesnt seem to interactive at all when i click on things nothing happens and all the links to papers from the paper list view lead to <number> errors is this happening for anyone else aside from this does anyone have tips and tricks for navigating the conference itself especially from the perspective of a junior ml engineer looking to broaden ones knowledge and seek out the latest trends in a particular subset of computer vision ml are the tutorials and workshops where its at or is it a better use of my time visiting the posters and talking to the researchers there,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NXNyY184UGJURHF3UHVkLVpMNkJ4YWRPVGtJcFhOdWpwQkpVRmRuaTB6WjlaYzJzSGoxMVNSQjBjYlhoM2pqNnl0NG5uRTBPbm9uRzZRVDJOZXROa3ZualZCbzhHeVEwLVFFVFdvWUl0UXM9

about <number> years ago when i was still actively working in this field a model created with tensorflow can be pushed directly to production via tensorflow model server and later via nvidia triton server which is just a thin wrapper around tf model server with some optional advanced features like tensorrt optimization for pytorch youll have to go through onnx this creates some headaches with dependencies where some ops from torch are not supported by some onnx versions and onnx supported by triton might be different from the exported models i had to create a script that perform surgery for onnx models to deal with this and that script later became a project of its own which is more work dont get me wrong tf also has this problems but to a much lesser degree we often joke that the time saved in training using torch were being paid by the time figuring out how to optimally deploy a torch model basically shifting works from model team to mlops team,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TWlzM2U5QmhCQTEwcWIwWks2akpsdnhyRHV0M05rcHNYUk9RZldfR2J2LTZVWVlhU0dRTGt5bzl3SWJlYWFLZkNaOGh5OEpfem15MVdJS2RxeDJ0M1hEdzB0R2tuMGkzTEw0NzdqR2pMMlk9

if you happen to be familiar with it how would you compare pytorch lightning to huggingfaces ecosystem i work with language models and i came to really dislike working with huggingface because i find that it abstracts away too muchi find myself having to look at the source code a lot just to understand what its really doing it really wants you to use its trainer api which i find is really limiting so as soon as i want to do anything slightly custom it immediately feels like im fighting the library instead of working with it at least thats my experience doing research if youre a practitioner who doesnt need to do anything other than what huggingface already provides it might be alright,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Vm5FV3pTVUo2c0VQZmR3ZGVwN19jbXVTSHp1dUVKclNqLTBWWkFReklkNkQ0ak4weVFnUmZFT0VCQ3BYUmlpb0MtVTEtakVWc2VEbmkxem1OZHNfOXc9PQ==

i started with tensorflow and ended up with pytorch despite the need to get everything deployed into tflite when first getting into the field and playing with the typical classification stuff keras felt very easy to use when trying to implement more unconventional stuff writing custom layers and so on i started to loose my mind over it a little then i ran into some sporadic bugs and crashes decided to ditch tensorflow after that i now experiment test and train using pytorch then export to onnx the whole torch > onnx > tf > tflite journey would cause a lot of issues a while ago but since onnxtf was released the conversion process to tensorflow has improved significantly onnxtf is <number> very stable and reliable unlike its predecessors <number> able to convert the whole model from channels first to channels last instead of adding a ton of transpose ops in front of conv layers which slow the model down significantly i still quantize my models while exporting from tensorflow to tflite with the tensorflow lite converter,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UGFmSDdpOXZjRUVpLW52eElwUEhySGFTZXl4aGZGUFVCWm9kR0dzOURRdlN2REt3c2c2UEF2N19rYk85S1BPRkJ4YzVzeXZSVW91OUdKRkdUcEtGOUE9PQ==
i started my current project with pytorch lightning at first it was fine but when i started to do things in nonstandard ways that require customization i started to need to really understand how the pytorch lightning magic works under the hood and the documentation is sparse on details and i wondered whether i would be better off using vanilla pytorch without all that magic or even jax for the next project and using my own abstractions where necessary i found understanding the pytorch lightning abstractions to be harder than writing my own so i would recommend pytorch lightning only for nonexpert programmers who want to try standard things eg for people who are learning the basics to get some motivation from early success or people who really have no need at all to do anything in a different way than what pytorch lightning implicitly or explicitly prescribes,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3Y1F3eGh4aXV1eU1oZ0E0Wlp3T2RzekZOSW1FREFNblJyU2VmWmdGbUJQbmNNTHRhVHlxdDZwR203cFAyTVJFdmNRN3d5c1FuV3l2cjRNZTk1akZWd1E9PQ==

>still perform very well outofsample despite massively overfitting this statement is contradictory perhaps you mean despite being overparameterized coming back to your main question at a high level i dont see a conflict to be reconciled the main relevant finding from double descent is that highly overparameterized models generalize better than models with intermediate complexity the chincilla paper points out that for a given computational budget smaller models trained on more data can outperform larger models trained on less data so the computational budget is fixed in other words it doesnt say that a larger model wont be better for the same amount of training data just that given a budget you get better bang for buck by training a smaller model because you can train it on more data so basically given a fixed amount of data a larger model is always better when you are in the overparameterized regime given a fixed model size more data is always better given a fixed compute budget there is an optimal combination of model size and amount of training data to spend the budget on,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3b21DTW1HMGpGc2RmMWVRMG9jQnNlWVNPRTV3bW9saVdwQXB3TEtZWHIwdmQ0TzZoRGpNVkpKNmdMMWY0cEZ5QU5aX1BzQWFEOEZLSExEazZsLTIxdnc9PQ==

huggingface and pytorch lightning are not the same at all pytorch lightning is just a constrained way on how to organize your code it is still pure pytorch however is it true that some things may be hidden if they can be derived from the elementary bricks of code you give for instance you provide the function that compute the loss then lightning knows where to call the optimizer step and so on but if you need to do a non conventional training loop youll have to activate some parameters like manual optimization and its not always easy to know what are those parameters name or even if they exist in the first place when you need to do manual things inside litghtning huggingface on the other hand is completly hiding everything which makes it really difficult to use if you need to do a different thing in the slightest way that what is expected for instance its not possible to do online data augmentation however when i need to use a hf model than i just integrate it in my own pytorchpytorch lightning codebase but i do not use hf trainer it work really well as its fully compatible for instance if i need a data collator from huggingface it can just use it in the collafn from a raw pytorch dataloader and itll work also you can just wrap a hf dataset into a pytorch dataloader and itll work too etc hf is very convenient for downloading models and running them easily because sometimes gits from papers all have a different api or are full of bugs and also applying preprocessing but id not use it for training,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WVZlTnh4V0FkVkYzbEhaSFRjSldMZGV3SDRtbHB2UjlPNWw3emZ1Z0ZycDVSVGJOTVV0a0otRE1CVUVVZXNVajFleDFvaXZYZFYtdzFyQTE3VDNKV1E9PQ==
yes many people misunderstand the chinchilla scaling laws that is an optimal point for performance given x amount of data for a particular compute budget as of now you can always get a better model with longer training given infinite compute also better here just means better loss values it has nothing to do with hardtoquantify intelligence which is what most people care about these days,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3d0Znak92bEhMdWRVXzNINzdOcXVUS0psdXVoejJ1aWdNd1JzTzFDSW1WaW9fU3ZjNjJ4Y1lxbnB2NndnUW5RREFQd1NscHFFRWdkcE9LQXdRbkNPckE9PQ==

while redundancy and a lot of it is imporant for humans with so much stuff affecting neurons and brain as a whole so much noise and randomness and seemingly less efficient in terms of packing more knowledge into less neurons way of learning for ai i think it doesnt matter its not like there are hormones that affect it and it needs to build new ways around it to overcome it and control itself to adapt its not like it has areas of low oxygen and nutrient supply viruses or bacteria eating cells or other forms of brain damage we can and should eliminate redundancy in ais for as long as their capabilities and potential for learning new stuff remains good current ai is redundant as heck this paper for example shows that language models only use about <number> bits per weight per synapse or so <url><url> i also read that in some cases they can remove like half of the models layers and it still works almost as good as before i guess these bitnet models likely as you said use their structure more efficiently they are forced to having no other option why do they still waste so much money infrastructure and energy on high precision deep learning hardware i guess basically because when they began it all gpus built for higher precision calculations were the only hardware that fit the job decently and so it stuck since the field is very inertial and there are many possible architectures approaches and tricks to try out before jumping to large scale investment into specific ones which might block trying out other approaches if you invest heavily in specific types of hardware and there are a lot of monetary interests too i guess although companies who need a lot of fast cheap inference and have the budgets one day will still just design their own ternary inference chips if no one else does it i guess also i guess the training of these ternarybinary models still requires high precision weights which makes hardware designed for training have less room for optimization and performance if i understand the implications of binaryternary models correctly for inference at least designing chips that have <number>x the performance per watt for large models the larger the more the gain becomes possible and also fitting much larger and more intelligent models on simpler hardware becomes possible too again the larger the models the more the gain and if inference gets so much fastercheaper creating larger models some even for running locally becomes possible too and more importantly you can finally integrate the tree of thoughtsgraph of thoughtslike search approaches which greatly increase their abilities if done right into the models at acceptable cost and layer many of such inner monologuesearchcorrection and editingmultiple inference per prompt approaches with each other,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cEhiRnpTa3F5R2FlRjhSRHotcXRtR0xKUG9zemVSdFo3Q3FqbVo5Y1h1VUFrMWk3UGJOemR3bDdwTlRMWkdmSGx3Q3h2NUljcFl4ZzJnM0J6bWRlaEE9PQ==

same experience for me it is a great library but as you start to add customization it becomes easier to just write your own loop or get a training template from somewhere and customize it i feel that is a bitter lesson that i learned working with dl research i tried more than once to write a generic trainer that would suit all my needs but it would always end up having way too many abstractions and being difficult to identify bottlenecks nowadays i use the plain script approach with some utilities from custom packages,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3N0xJOFJOOS0wVWVNejh5aTlBRldjdFhIaDZ5eVJMVDVlMVZHTEdBdTkwb05MTC1ZaE9rOFY1VEZNb084RTByVWZ4UkZQS29iSzJPVGxxcHJFVHFxQmc9PQ==

my guess is that the metrics are only valid when it comes to open source models when it comes to proprietary llm models there are safety security + who knows what else measures laid on top of them which hurts actual performance generally speaking the complexity of llms is growing so much that no metric can reasonably measure how good they are or how much better they are from previous versions companies are incentivized to push for higher numbers for pr reasons but at this point personal experience on basic use cases really tells you what is going on,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cDZGV3lhTmtPc3hWa0pLTThOLVBrWUVjQUgyZUgwSHREZXBObjctenowNkQ4LVpDSjk3eGROX3E4T05KMkQyV0xvc0JEa0N3R2JPQnRUTUpWdFJoNWc9PQ==

dude dont make this personal m and actually defend yourself just answer the question and its a trend i noticed this is highlighting that benchmarks may out there may be worse for real use cases that people have which developers optimize for which in turn can make things worse in production,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SzZTOUo2enpRdWM5V01Edk5yaXp6eU80ZDRoRGs3ZHc4YXBVa1YzZ2VNcTVsdFhnWVQ1SHJJME1RMUVtOGZfM19KdEN4MWRkUFVCVVJJVUhYSHhNNWpHTHJCQXJlU2tYd0NIUzhEbkZCdDg9

its not just me thats noticing it many other people outside of reddit is saying it too this is the whole purpose on discussion of questioning the actual effectiveness of current benchmarks that can potentially mislead developers when creating llms that is a stupid question thats the whole point of research i do it myself so its not easy but bad research believes sets people bad and does more harm than good also again if you pay attention and read bad benchmarks can lead to developers over optimizing for the benchmarks that may not have too much use case for effectiveness by over optimizing it it leads to less effective models when a measure becomes a target it becomes a less effective measure situation is what i am saying here,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3R3hlRHppSFFWY1R2R09uSk9yN3VjMXoydzlzTmRrS2VRWnFPOHVDSXBpcnJJSVFJOGtfNHlaQ1Q5dmhDTzdyaEdrR0xBck4zUE0ySlBFMU1Mbm8xWkVuTWhjVGVGWEt1RnNJeDlDenhRNHM9

my answer as an engineer would be it depends on your time and resource constraints with the first option you pretty much have everything ready out of the box and just need to glue them together you likely wouldnt even need to do your own training my answer as an enthusiast would be that the latter is a cleaner solution one other thing to consider is that in the two model solution you have models that would be trained on two totally different objectives one is a generative objective the other is classification meaning that their training data will be in two different structures so if you do end up having to train the two models then you will have to do a bit more work to assemble those two datasets instead of just one big one,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UVd2dGRKX0Z4MnkyZTlTZ3pTVXBFcDNkdGh2a05nTEtxM016WWxTUmlXTUZfTlV0dWthMVM0U2RJU0p2QnRjTVFiWTltMERkaHRlcFdlY1plNjIzb0E9PQ==
my recommendation is to have your reading be guided by two things curiosity and an interest in solving some specific concrete problem at the graduate level the distinction between different fields of study is largely artificial everything ultimately amounts to doing math with computers and so youre going to be most productive if you focus on specific goals rather than confining yourself to specific fields focusing your efforts this way will also help to avoid the very common academic mistake of attempting to apply a particular method to solving a wellknown problem for which it is inappropriate and ineffective merely because you happen to consider yourself to be specializing in that method,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YldjR3cwVlNKZ005cjI4OUJjZFBGV2xjYlI3YmZ6VzdGcDNvQk03Q2FTaTJKZUtKR1l3TWljTWFkNUNCUXp5VmRUMUVCUUszLTBmU3p1OWNCTTBoT3c9PQ==

you can absolutely use detailed notes as long as your replimenting something that isnt basically just the notes you just cant use anything decompiled or disassembled directly the reason two teams are commonly used is because it privides extra legal protection as you can claim the implimenting team never dissasemled so their work couldnt contain anything directly copied this is especially relevent when the disassembled code is so trivial that its likely the only viable answer and your answer will look almost identical to the copyrighted code so the two team seperation is so you can convince a court that your almost identical code is not the copyrighted code for example when your code is just sending a specific intiger to a specific cpu register this is not case in this situaion whatsoever a libcuda reimplimentaion will not look anything like the orginal a second team cant hurt at all but its just one thing that companies have done to win their cases its not a minimum requirement to win your own case,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WjZxNlNKQk9hWGZUQU5IcGlQM1FHMzVHdlFVRnllcFBGeW5RU0k0UzZycVhucjkzcDlvRkFEbjN2Vk0wRHI5Y0E0aEc5UlRGMGF1bmF4RGFFR25mLVE9PQ==

this is the response that appears on virtually every example of llms failing to reason usually in the context of an unfalsifiable belief that llms can reason any correct output they take as evidence that an llm is engaged in reason any failure is dismissed with but humans also fail to reason sometimes this is true but usually humans are tripped up by well known word play andor undercutting dialectic assumptions pound of feathers example along those lines <number> we should have actual evidence people also have a high failure rate at the task and not just the imagination of some random person on the internet <number> we should focus on the types of failures for an llm that are unsurprising if the llm has no understanding or ability to reason but highly unexpected if it can understand and reason whats significant are examples that involve no dialectical misdirection that any human can easily succeed at but llms fail at theres a feedback problem though in that as we find and discuss such examples they can then end up in the training data and then contaminate future results note that this paper involves the llms outputting reasons for their nonsensical solutions that are also nonsensical even if a human failed at the initial task its hard to imagine them continuing to do so on these conditions ive seen this myself with some of my own tests involving very simple games that a child could successfully complete,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3OUlqV3IwdWRrOFQwQVBEUklYUmM0RnVEa0hva3FEWm85R25PV1Z2WlJ1dGI1N09ib0dmcTJ3OEUyQVJyMXY4ek85LWlDUHRRcTk3LU9RRG8wR01RQ1FxRUw5WTQ1OUpUM2JTM1pGLUduUms9

the paper is slightly differentit takes a qr decomposition of the original large dense pretrained matrix it appears to subtract off the low rank approx and call that the new fixed w and then use those qrs as the perturbations to be adapted so the perturbation does not start at size zero but it starts out as the complement of what you took off there is a hyperparameter s mentioned in the paper in places and then runs with no discussion of its values or optimization of it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3aXhGXzBBb3JNRDVaRlBKUEZYVG92b093dmZXaWpjaEVaY3I3Zl9Na3JCR055d2pwUGtVTC1DUHdVdlpicWdEMUZEclZwNWJwZkZ0ZjVESE5LY3Q3bnc9PQ==
youre correct the author makes the ab initialization with some non trivial size so that winit + abperturbation = wpretrained updating the base fixed matrix winit from the pretrained one and using that in the forward pass its clever the difference is that the free parameter matrix ab starts out not at zero but already pointing in the direction of the most important subspaces of w so individual updates to components of a or b from sgd can immediately have a significant effect on the transformation if you initialize a or b to zero then perturbations of whichever one is not zero start out not having any effect until the other one gets to nonzero size which can take a number of steps so standard <number> init has a wakeup deficiency and learning starts too slowly so to my conception the papers algorithm performs as if the primary training were interrupted at some point and then learning continues only in the dominant subspaces with a new text corpus more like changing primary training midstream than directly learning a perturbation,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ZGJMTmNnaUZHZW40VWM2UUE4SHIzMTJBYUFNTFlPeGVGczBlb2FUYml1SUNmcGtsdWRTVmV4UDNxaUxmQkhRT283dl9sTEJMNklRVndWUUdIeGVlcGc9PQ==
its my understanding that orthogonal initialization creates a well conditioned optimization problem and helps stabilize the gradients at the start of training i would be interested in seeing more theory about what effects this has later on in training also the dataset changes the optimization problem so maybe that should affect which initialization we should choose could be worth playing around with if it hasnt been looked into already not too familiar with nn initialization research,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3N1Nza2pZM1lScnRMekl4bFQ0c1dUZHM2ZHBVMHlyZkRBUWQ3WFJUUWtITlhXUzhlUThkQ3AxLWhrbEE1MHFTZ3ZJY1M5Z3BCb0ctR3ItalI3Y2dTMGRkUHRXVzhYLXNvcUJQSjJQbU1OZnM9

thank you for the clarification applying data augmentations directly during training makes a lot of sense and seems very efficient i appreciate the resource link for pytorch as well just to confirm if we apply random rotations during training we dont need to manually rotate and save each image beforehand correct also are there other common augmentations we should consider besides rotation,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QW1yZUlNSEMxcG9jSGw1LXRqTzVCYnI3aGpVcHhMcEtxbHhsNzJHNjRON3J6dGNNT3JPaWluaXVkWmF4NFN4V3ItOS1PYUNDeXV5LWdueFUxMXJ0SHc9PQ==

the confusion comes from the fact that sampling density is not density it is the number of samples per distance not volume assume n points are distributed evenly in p dimensional space and we have d points on each dimension d^p ~ n thus d ~ n^<number>p in local methods we care about distance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4U3RzMU45SktNc2ZiTnhvdFBzY2tia3NxLUlqZDdRS0xOU25NcnhFb09ldlVNd0ZEalZEQ2Z1QXRMdWlfaWtJckJ3TUpOV01OZ2tkc3BqUHZrNm9mT0E9PQ==
i appreciate your suggestion but my question is more technicaltheoretical than practical however consider a situation where you want to run a large multimodal model with hundreds of billions of parameters on a device with limited resources or a case where the model provider doesnt want to share their model with the user and the user doesnt want to share their data with the provider do you see any technical issues with this idea can the cloud provider reverse engineer the inputs from the first layer which runs on the users local machine to figure out the raw input data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VnE3cm9Qd21OVURvQ3YtcHhSNEFPcS15UVZZMGFBYmFuUnprQW0zR1JaLWVvRHJGalpCb2JxVzNfRWwzSUdiSU5HTHJpRzcxOTU2bkgwOEowb2laVUE9PQ==

still kinda a noob with ml can i clarify why we care about distance instead of volume my understanding is that volume is important because it tells us the how much data we have to form a local average the larger the volume the more stable the local average estimate would sampling density be something like seeing a traffic light every <number> metres on a very long straight road if we decrease the distance between traffic lights we see traffic lights more often so higher sampling density,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4c0hndWRWVUg0TXFLVXVsNGVCYXhYaFBhTldsY0JuSTcyNG9uYXpLRVNIY1ZmOE5xSUJCanIyUl8zZV9CUUhZZDlzOHpuc0pwRThUZ2JlcVBrUmdZLXA4Qmo4WW8wQkRCZ2d3OUdGR1o2WUk9

>please take this duty seriously once again i remind everyone that reviewing is done for free and all top ml conferences have used shady practices in the past in order to maximize reviewer load there is only one recourse to being overburdened with papers because you didnt know that the way to adapt the reviewing load is to decline the invitation first also over the years all top ml conferences have increased reviewer load by adapting the reviewing scheme to push more work on reviewers over longer periods of time discussions are not free for reviewers they take time energy and the burden is increasing superlinearly with the number of papers since it becomes increasingly harder to keep the details of more papers in your head all of this has been done without increasing reviewer payoff i would like to know in what world people believe that increasing workload at the same payoff zero usd would not have any impact on average quality in all work items signed someone who reviewed for all top ml conferences in the past even though they had no intentions to submit there that year also i was invited to become ac but not to review afte ri declined i guess i deserve my free year,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eHMyVU9rZ1JLOGpWNTBaSEhCem0zSEk2VFY0UXN5N2RxZEtJN0VyR3dKc1JMNGhLa1ZKSG96RUpYOXBwekpzNmtFYV9KNTh2a1FBV0pkX3FEYUtISXc9PQ==
thanks ustochastaclysm im not a security expert but imagine im using a local rag architecture ie i have a vector database of my docs photos etc and an embedding model like clip running on my local machine i prompt a query on something like ollama and ask for a response i dont want to send the raw input of my prompt and personal documents to the cloud due to privacy reasons however my local machine cant run the whole large model locally so i think it could be a good idea to run the first few layers of the model locally then pass the result to the cloud and finally process the result from the middle layers back on the local machine note that the cloud doesnt have any information about the weights of the first and last layers due to some finetuning process which we can set aside for now,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4V21uZTNHMzB2X0hIdWxEaGtyVXFmNkJvRVk3ckxzWkJidEJtSFlvckhtVnVQX3Zna055X3g0Z3JWYTQxa0k5aXJlVE9NUV8tM3dLQ1BWcDhDekc1d2c9PQ==

is that really so by no means do i have some proper insight into this but it seems like even when ignoring data poisoning the larger the dataset the less quality there is to the information provided im guessing training lms on a smaller subset of professional articles would result in much more useful output rather than getting millions of stackoverflow answers and such where people are free to write anything they want with no credibility i assume the expansion of lms is more going towards that direction since that is more complicated than the first scenario so the models might be working better from a metrical perspective but not from a human perspective due to the lack of information quality assessment,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZW03LVFpXzhwVkVQZDVSVVhNOEVHT1NhS3JVTkpHM0MtbTFNcGg1djVMcXlOR1hIMFZnUTNlVi0zZDdjdGV1bWk0VExxY0tYRXJVMkdsM095UjRpbWc9PQ==

back in <number> most people assumed that a propagating wave must be traveling in some physical medium but that turned out not to be true that assumption was the product of fundamental misunderstandings about how the world works now most people seem to assume that something that uses language must also be doing some degree of reasoning but i think thats false perhaps even obviously so just as people who were trying to characterize the luminiferous aether were ultimately attempting to study something that didnt actually exist so too do i think that the people who are carefully analyzing the reasoning capabilities of llms are spending their time dissecting observations that are ultimately unrelated to the subject of their interest namely the capacity to reason,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4N1gwUy1VZHl6dzlyTXNUci11NWJlZDEyTmU1NHdURWtfUDMtN2JTaFBBUE5YWVAta2plVkZ1WUYxUmMtRkxxVEU4Mk53Um8zVGdRWlBVb0hHZVlGQXc9PQ==

certainly thank you for the question overall the process requires two datasets a collection of songs with genre labels and a collection of image generation prompts with genre labels ideally the sets of genre labels are the same for both datasets for the song dataset i collected creative commons music and normalized the genre labels for the image generation prompt dataset i took each of the genres and asked chatgpt turbo <number> api to generate prompts specifically for that genre i collected around k prompts and split into training and validation data some example prompts for the genre of rock a roaring motorcycle speeding on a desert highway under a bloodred sunset dust clouds rugged terrain dynamic angles warm tones massive waves crashing against jagged cliffs stormy skies lightning flashes foam power contrast between dark and light dynamic composition a towering inferno in an urban wasteland crumbling buildings billowing smoke flames licking the sky chaos destruction intense heat fiery hues a majestic eagle soaring through rugged mountains against a fiery sunset dynamic angles piercing gaze vast expanse freedom rugged beauty the prompt embedding autoencoder takes the output embedding sequence of the sd <number> text encoder and encodes it to a single <number>dimensional vector here only the image generation prompt dataset is needed at training time the encoder and decoder are trained to minimize the reconstruction error of the output embedding sequence at training time <number> of the encoder inputs are randomly set to zero in order to make the training task a bit more challenging for cyclegan training both the song dataset and the image generation prompt dataset are needed the idea was to apply the style transfer from cyclegan but to separate modalities the source generator input is the audio embedding from a random slice of a random song in some genre the discriminator takes the output of the generator or of a real sd embedding sequence as well as the label of the genre and has to determine whether the embedding sequence is real or fake the generator is a relatively simple ffnn for the discriminator the genre label is incorporated through film layers i did not have a proper evaluation method for the cyclegan part so i kind of winged that im sure this could be improved theres some detail i still left out i should probably take the time to write it up properly,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eklLQVd6aWMyZFVvamxsSG80NEs1T3prRU96dUtha1FPeFpZOGhLdnZyM0hpQlN3SnBJRVhxbzU1aTBGa2hWUWhBeno2bkdMdFJ6b2Zvc2g5ck5iVVE9PQ==

sorry i can see how you may consider a my comment directed toward you personally it was more a jest in general for the gpupoor  i definitely wasnt clear and the wording does indeed reflect a comment intended as such that said i was questioning my own comment when writing it because you were already using mainframes maybe it was late lol my b anyway i trade fx and have also considered fine tuning a model on time series data i just i mostly thought i was just crazy  but happy to know there are others i bought a supermicro superserver grtrt and put x tesla ms mostly for the vram since theyre more for desktop virtualization than raw compute got it all for a steal so figured id do some testing among other things if you build something be sure to update,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cm1mTTlwOWgzdUtseHVQbzJ0LTFVZGFzOXByckwxTHNmaGxCa2RqSnN0Njc0RmpZajhBaUtFUGk2MDhPMC1HUVNkWFN5YzhGdjhOTkUxNnVNYTlFTGc9PQ==

>the types of failures for an llm that are unsurprising if the llm has no understanding or ability to reason but highly unexpected if it can understand and reason these terms are rather problematic first the sheer ambiguity and inherent anthropomorphism of the term understanding makes it rather useless when applied to an lm as long as we dont aim to replicate humanlike cognitive architecture which i think is well beyond the current goals of ml the more neutral terms are performanceoriented they allow for a fair comparison of a human and an algorithm without enforcing nonessential requirements on either subject second the ability to reason is nonbinary and cannot be fit into two discrete categories have or have not such false impression most probably stems again from anthropomorphism and the fact that most humans have roughly similar level of this ability at least compared to the possible dispersion in machine models failures at certain tasks perhaps different for humans and for algorithms would just highlight different proficiency profiles within the broader landscape of reasoning abilities the view that humans are the gold standard and the absolute ideal of the reasoning skill is quite naive,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4U2sxQUNETVJOc1R0LTV1czNaWGxjVVhoT0xSbDJSUTViSmtZaldzRHRTUGJ2VXdMU1ZoY1I4OTQ5SHlDb0RGNWMwSmVRMlY1TjNMUzdJY2VkLTU5NFl1UFh0VDViZmVxQV9vVVctZEtLcnM9
i think you see a lot of implementation complexities in this which i find unclear could you please explain these complexities a bit more many frameworks including pytorch support model splitting and parallelization we can use this feature to split the llm into three parts input middle and output each part may include one or several layers of the neural network for example consider the bertlarge architecture <number> the input part on the local machine receives the raw input tokenizes it embeds it into a vector adds positional encoding computes the first couple of encoder layers and sends the result to the cloud <number> the middle part in the cloud computes the next <number> layers of encoders and sends the result back to the local machine <number> the output part on the local machine computes the last couple of encoder layers the linear layer and the final softmax in this scenario the local machine processes four encoder layers tokenizes and embeds the input and performs the final linear and softmax computations using relatively few resources meanwhile the cloud handles <number> encoder layers with this approach the cloud cannot extract inputs and outputs because the cloud does not have the proper info about the parameters of those four layers while handling the heavy computation for the llm,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4X2g4ckszOGo5QW5oNUl5YjVkdU5NWG1ZSnFSb1RtZlRKVlc4aUhxMThIQ1VTRDB2Z3AtczZQekk5MWw2U210RUhUeHEtTS1BWlBNbDhNU1RXWjBmV3c9PQ==

depends what your output should condition on if you only have a sequence then use a gpt style decoder only transformer if you have some additional source of information you want to inject alongside the sequence then use a full transformer if the sequences are complete you could also use an encoder only transformer the only difference is that you wont use a mask to disable attending to future values this would be a bert style transformer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZGIxRmhyMnFGTEcxUE1tWHVLWUYybEFUeWpWSVFhaWhZRmU1dDItc0YwQ1Y5d0dENUtMVmsxekcwY1hBNDY0b2pmdERyeEVDcTRTNmJLT0JBeUJlZXc9PQ==

in my mind the distinction between reasoning and nonreasoning is partly one of efficiency and extensibility one could imagine a hypothetical ultracomputer that has rote memorized every possible problem statement and its corresponding solution this would give every appearance of being able to perform reasoning as a human does or even better but i think this doesnt count as reasoning because this computer is essentially just a giant lookup table that doesnt use any form of compression or abstraction in order to arrive at a solution we could also imagine a somewhat less impressive ultracomputer that has rote memorized many problemssolutions but not all of them not only is this still just a lookup table but it doesnt have any procedure for using abstractions and algorithms in order to identify solutions to the problems that it hasnt already memorized this is very similar to the situation that we have with llms i think theres also an underappreciated social dimension to reasoning one that is different from just pattern matching or problem solving we dont just reason in order to solve problems we also do it in order to communicate with other people so as to solve problems collectively and build social bonds llms can mimic this activity if you have them talk to each other but ultimately theyre just regurgitating scripts they arent capable of the dynamism that is demonstrated by humans interacting with each other and indeed i think all of this can be seen straight forwardly in the way that llms are trained they are quite literally not trained to be able to solve the math problems that correspond to what we consider to be reasoning they are trained to do regression nothing else they can repeat acts of reasoning that theyve seen in their training data but they cannot produce new ones contrast this with human social activity which corresponds to math problems like finding correlated or nash equilibria these are different problems from regression and they are fundamentally harder ones to solve its for this reason that i see game playing models like the various alphawhatevers which use monte carlo tree search or reinforcement learning as being actual examples of machine reasoning theyre just less viscerally compelling or emotionally affecting because they do not demonstrate their reasoning in terms of human language,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eDV5V0thSGt3WkhJOElFM0ZGZ0x3WHNUSW9CVGZQdUFpeFdnTXJxcnQ4dF9ldG9iblE3ZU1HaVVoUFBqaFRfaTNScDRldjlWZkNXc1YtaVRCUllVV0E9PQ==

thanks for the detailed reply thats a really interesting take i agree with a lot of points like the social dimensions of reasoning i agree that ai like alphazero are doing some high level reasoning and elements of system ii thinking in terms of strategic planning etc hybrid models that mix mcts with transformer architecture are interesting too i dont know what to make of this<url> but its cool perhaps its an example of machine reasoning you recognize as such but emerging from a partly transformer architecture or another hybrid model involving llm architecture could be deepminds sima still in its infancy but already seemingly able to generalize its a long way from system ii type stuff but its intriguing to imagine something like sima with something like alphazeros capabilities,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4UUdPSjgxVFAyMjhNVWo1VmZuRERzWUJ4elJndXpKbGI5Q0xxcjFqNVNQdlB1ZWZqRzREUnRKaF9QWG5HclNzbnVJaHF4clduc3VNMENmTlMtUHYwZHc9PQ==

this is a cool idea not what you asked but just to throw my cents in after a decade in research i found the best way to handle it psychologically is just to focus on what you can control judge each day by the quality of your attention results are fleeting and even sometimes transient and a good result is the product of years of failure so judging yourself by your results at least on a short timescale is a recipe for misery depression and eventually just abandonment failed attempts and dead ends are the only certainty in research what you do have control over though is your own efforts and as long as the quality of your attention each day is high as in you are focused and deeply engaging with your problem you are doing all you can do and some kind of progress will come about eventually with this mindset you can go to bed satisfied even during the inevitable periods of stagnation and also avoid the allure of perpetually grabbing low hanging fruit rather than doing something really original if such a thing is still possible in todays research environment,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZkVJNWtuWDFaUjVoOEZnZG9Fd0ZXbmhmSnRHdWJ6MFhLZUhJb1RQUXRueHM3RjFIaG0zWEluMV8tcVk0T0xGMW5LREt1NnVwQnl1NXVyNmR6b1hVNmc9PQ==
i think its important to distinguish between transformers and llms you can use transformers for anything and llms are just one particular application i think of llms as being a method of training more so than a distinct kind of model and of course transformers only ever do regression but the real question is what that regression is used for llms just do straight regression entirely disconnected from any particular goal which is why they basically just act like fancy lookup tables alternatively one could as you point out use a transformer in implementing mcts the difference between this and llms is that in this case what the transformer is learning to do is anticipate the way in which interactions with an environment and other agents will impact a particular set of goals the transformer itself isnt doing any reasoning its the combination of mcts + transformer that produces reasoning people have been trying to do something reminiscent of this with llms where they use reinforcement learning or monte carlo or something similar to explore possible llm outputs in order to perform some task but in my opinion this is essentially assbackwards and will probably never work the problem with this is that its using the llm as the environment but that cant work because of what i mentioned earlier the llm isnt trained to perform regression towards the purpose of solving any particular goal and so you wont be able to use the llm by itself in order to derive robust reward signals,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4aDJmYi1pVUtMNHR5ekxPOWdrSzExLWttdVF5WlNjanlCV1YwazhDMXZSSndwNDBPaDdXcjNuVnNCVzU5V1lzdmsyZm5TRUYtS3NXTm5ZcWxLa05kZkE9PQ==

yeah i get that but if take an example of the data point like steps if person is having any mental health episode he is more likely to move less which can be interpreted as the ratio of steps by moving average of steps will be significantly lower and i wanted to create several other data points like this for example variation in heart rate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4NnVJSGY5V2djenFZbDZGUkNoazZRRVVPeUJ4R1dvejlHVDl4NXdTUVRqTndOWUZnVnFvN2x0QVlYdm52ejRUVnB6RjlZVWNDcnh3TWhSN2tEZjczZGc9PQ==
to be honest i am a little skeptical of those results with yolo datasets anything that is not labeled is implicitly labeled as background in these images many pimples are not labeled because of this to have the model find some pimples but not all of them to yield a high map would be overfitting unless there is an important distinction i am missing that being said you should be able to at least good training accuracy comparing to their baseline with the largest yolo model but beware of overfitting if deploying it so make sure you have a good test set separate from all your trainingval sets,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eEZjYXJOSGdzV3dPd2FvdHFnWkJBeEhiRVlfbDdNa0kxXzJTeXQzeFdISW1md3FEbGtLMU1TMERiWC13ZkFQN3dDcC1aQ2I5aXVUUUFGSDk0ZjB6cHc9PQ==

research experience is the most important thing research is an entirely different game to studying having research experience shows that a you know what you are getting yourself into and are less likely to bail b you have probably already developed some of the practices that allow you to make progress such as learning how to read papers how to break problems down and make incremental progress on your own perseverence etc it may sound harsh but advisors want to avoid taking on a student who will need a lot of hand holding andor be likely to drop out research experience helps to quash those concerns,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZE9BYUcyODBPQzFlMFQtRTI0U2RLcWRwUHhPei0wZkw5WTFrMmRhQVlTVlEwX1Y1NnNkTjktZ2JzanpGX1FwOFZjR2IwTTROTnR3OTlmQU9lQV82VHc9PQ==

usually youd want to observe the training curve of your model by logging the training lossaccuracy and validation lossaccuracy in order to avoid things like overfitting you can also use early stopping to stop the training earlier if it doesnt make much progress on the validation set the more advanced technique would be to use bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4NFY0ZEFjT2QzVjh3ZnRXaXdQOXYwN2ZQVmN0cG5IMDVDb28yMkZEQ0FSemxrVmZTVmotV0hBbU96ZW1XZFhJZ1M2dHBWQVE2ZHJuZ1lxc2x6M3dUVUo3Z0dUS095b3NBaXM0WDVWQW53anc9

i see the usecase is around discovering issues described in the customeragent conversations that are beyond the usual suspects so the entity dictionary would probably be one of the outcomes expected from the exercise llms seemed reasonable despite my hesitation when it comes to such models because their nlu capabilities are quite remarkable as long as there isnt much domain specific knowledge involved the deployment cost can be handled with certain optimizations if the results are worth it but clearly it requires too much post processing to make the results consumable was hoping the folks here had similar experiences and had found ways to deal with it before i move on to other possibilities,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4WjQzLXBBMzFtU3BqT0dBcWtGNzRLblZFbnFFaS1QWHZyMU5jVERaeVRyX2JZSzh6cUdYemx5OWVhWW5lbVJnTlJSdGNrYkUzeVZJUHVaY1czc09oR0E9PQ==

are you using a pretrained model you do not have to use transformers for forecast as a must it mainly depends on your pretraining task for example gpts are specially trained with next token prediction tasks good for forecasting but models such as bert are mainly trained on masked token predictions which are excellent for creating meaningful encodings a good representation of your input data for your project i would suggest you use an encoder transformer trained with the same paradigms as bert for example then finetune it by using a prediction head on a classification task unsupervised training followed by finetuning has been shown to do wonders good luck,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4XzZhY3Y0Nm1tOXJwVFpVeVJhX2pITEctbEhRdmtWdUQ4WERvS1l0dF9RX25NM0Q2Tk5XRzZyRmktNVpiUDhWeXdhc3hIZFVTNzlaWUhiYW5objNTT2c9PQ==

both are powerful frameworks and imho the comparison as whole cannot be really objective because there are many use cases where one proves to be more practical to use than the other and vice versa personally overall i like the tensorflow <number> approach more than pytorch but google software project direction is a mess lacking of vision and consistence they have a large army of development teams lousy organized and the approach is to write something not focusing on its design problematics never fix them then notice the problematics and write something totally different to address them and deprecate everything with poorly documented migration guides if any this is happening regularly basically with any google software stack in latest years the big transition to tensorflow <number> has caused this a large chunk of old tensorflow supporters become furious due to massive deprecation of code no longer working in the latest version a large chunk of those that used both tensorflow and pytorch focused on this one rather than relearn the new tensorflow tons of examples manuals and tutorials on the web are outdated and unusable so basically now tensorflow is like a newer platform with less mature ecosystem from a community standpoint and most opinions about comparison of tensorflow vs pytorch are outdated as well because related to old tensorflow limits and problems or biased by the rage against massive codearmageddon the transition to newer tensorflow version has caused some people see that they are also working on jax and like to rush opinions of the kind <<tensorflow is dead they are working on jax>> not realizing that jax actually is complementary to tensorflow and eventually could be merged with it when mature enough not something that can replace tensorflow as it could cover only a subset of things of tensorflow that is a large framework made up of various different modules with keras as highlevel api,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4SXNJcTE3U3FHVjVLSEdldzlxOWdxazcxR0hMTEdJVms2ZVRZek9zMk9GTVd6OGhnb0JrZWdHQUdnblV6LXZDaGM0S1Z4blRPdkVhN0VhdkZkNzVqa2c9PQ==

i would like to understand the reason behind altering the preprocessing of data after the model has undergone pretraining finetuning specializes the model for a specific task modifying the data preprocessing would constitute retraining rather than finetuning to address your question stability the models weights have been optimized for the distribution of the original data if the data undergoes significant changes the retraining process becomes highly unstable consequently the model may either fail to converge to a reasonable solution or require an excessively long time to achieve convergence,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4OV9sZEZzaFFBRkF3a01UV0RkcXZVTFlUUDlabUI4TENmR3BYRXRlVElPS25QMGQ1cjBWT2JsSURlemVobjd6Wjgya3Y5N2Z3ZEJEbHhyVXJoZjdPMlE9PQ==

so ive started messing around with splines and doing a hacked up job of replacing weights in various types of layers with b splines they just seem to work better than cubic splines this was inspired by the kan hype going around again they seem to be able to do any other layer would do maybe with a little bit more accuracy in tasks like shape identification and text classification i decided to go the other direction and try using them in a vae for simple things like generating colored shapes it can perform the task with some issues with clarity ive tried subbing in transpose convd in the decoder and that clears it up but the idea is to use my own layers to do this <url><url> when it comes to more complicated task such as text to image like the phrase red square on a yellow background it completely fails replacing the spline layer in the decoder with transpose conv d again mostly fixes the issue <url><url> how do i improve the decoding in this experimental layer encoding doesnt seem to be a problem ive since added dropout and batch norm and get an improved albeit blurry visualization seeing what else i can tweak,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eEh5aURCUHFWLVhPS2kybWgwemVBRjBvelhXQ0ZMYWpyNTgyXzh5eUxUSFZRUlh4eGNQeDhra1RpVjJNZUNCSFVnNzRpWndwQUVteEh5NXRmLWJta3c9PQ==

i feel like guarding the prompt will always be gamed itd be stronger to guard the outputs imo and we can use a small pretrained llm even without finetuning but it would be better with it to test against your alignment rules the only way to game this would be to make the assistant llm to output rules as well to the guard model but the guard model would not be trained to follow instructions do this multiple times and we have a solution for alignment of big models as well its what openai plan in the long term if im not mistaken,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZnVpMnRWUjlqdEtlMHAxRk5FMHlxOU82WTQ2SHotNlJSQjdzM1ptV0pIYjByMUxMdUZjY0p4V2dqQXRVNktmUjNUcHNMS3NKOWdXR3JoQ25pNXRKb1E9PQ==

use a foundation model and finetune it will often work much better to answer specifically to your code i often see multiples convs layers <number><number> before pooling if you stack several conv layers then its equivalent to having a bigger receptive field instead of using a layer with a costly big kernel also maybe you overfitted so try some regularization using data augmentation strong and weak augmentations even dropout also it is weird that batchnormalizationor variants like layernorm harms performance as it is often a key component of many neural networks looking more carefully to your optimization optimizer scheduler,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4YUZ3WWY0cExrRjkxTHZUTFZJMUNSZm1PUHg5ak9OZlhZckNrVE1KSDgwN05ZZENFanFjTzV1LUFuR0hqLW05VXc3MVhuamRNV1JMOS1Rd0JKQjQ1dGc9PQ==

the papers abstract >ai systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks we present an approach inspired by recent advances in representation engineering that shortcircuits models as they respond with harmful outputs existing techniques aimed at improving alignment such as refusal training are often bypassed techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks as an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training shortcircuiting directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place our technique can be applied to both textonly and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks notably while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge shortcircuiting allows the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image hijacks that aim to produce harmful content finally we extend our approach to ai agents demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks the paper builds on representation engineeringaitransparencyorg <number> whereas the anthropic <number>s work uses sparse autoencoders which is a bit more roundabout,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MElweFR1cHpxOTZQUUhDM29qVzJsNEJUSlRhb0RScHJGLVFKRjVCZlVCdkNmanlaakNJNm5KWEN3WG9qU3NWWWtmeU1IVGI5bG5QRjY4enU2dzR6cnc9PQ==

essentially what you are trying to solve is imo best framed as an inverse problem you have some forward model mapping x to y say image to label or downscaled version now you set a prior on the space of images px and a likelihood py|x where the likelihood controls how close the sampled x should mapped to y and px what you know a priori about your dataset or x distribution this can be solved classically by mcmc and in the world of conditional generative models using conditional nfsdiffusionflow matching whatever you like let me know you want more input,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5bVZ0V01PQi1CeXFOQ3BQTmdRTHRNR0cyai1zUDJhWW9rbVc0MUc5V3Z6anhpMk9ILW5vNDNKcEVaT2FkckpxSmpyNTBQcnZZYzFWajVzNzJEVzlDNE43RnY4MG8zaU9oNVdTYVBncXJqS3c9

the line that separates large language models from other language models is not clearly defined from what ive seen starting from b parameters and up they are considered large again opinion may differ to give you an idea of the amount of memory these require remember that one floating point is typically represented by bytes in the gpu so b parameters = <number> x x <number> = gb b parameters = <number> x x <number> = gb b parameters gpt <number> = <number> x x <number> = gb you might find the quantized version of the model which reduces the size but also lowers precision for example q = bits per parameter = byte q = bits per parameter = <number>byte so bq actually needs b parameters = q <number> x x <number>= <number>gb q <number> x x <number>= gb of course this is back of the envolope math but the real number will be somewhere around that as you can see these are way too big to fit in most consumer grade gpus or a mobile device so youll find smaller language models smls if you will with vary from a fue hundred million parameters >mb <number>b to b b b,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZUhnVGVNUTRXOWdfZTJkZjBweEQwV3NiTzhzdEFhRjFmREZ0X0VrOXdtdVBISktTUC1RTXlMdXhDeURFeVNVbmN1Tmk0Ym4zZS1SQVJXYXpKZm9lY0E9PQ==

differentiable and invertible are not the same is your function actually invertible other wise you are looking for level sets not points you will also run into optimization issues as gradients will be quite degenerate finally it doesnt matter that x follows a certain distribution as you are just interested in a given function f for which you are trying to find an inverse a very classical algorithm is to consider the sequence xn+<number> = xn y fxn if it converges its solution is a fixed point and fx = y this will not always work if you have access to gradients you can use newtons method or other optimisation algos <url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5QWlOWXlocDlBakVtR3BKSVRZRk5ZSEtKWE9SUGV1YUphai0xbVZoVXJxZ3MzVUttVlRkRWJ2MXRKMkUxcjhPYXRYUzVCQ3FJUTBXTTVqLVhzRGVWenc9PQ==

it really depends on the data but getting mcmc to work can be a pain in high dimensions also you need to write down the prior explicity on what kind of data are you working dimension of xy what is the prior image or not other than that i am pretty sure conditional generative models are the way to go and i think conditional nfs are usually simplest to program and test as long as you dont work with hard image data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZF9rZ0k2REYzSWhwWmthVE5ieEtiTVhNOWgtOFhuRmV5alp4dl9qR2k3ci1wZDFyUzJaLWUya2RyNXdldHY1Z0Z2ejg4aWdNTzFhdUxwMFZoZlpwLUJPQXhIRTJHWmR2ZXpNVjFwSWlrSTQ9

the main idea of using conditional generative models is that you wanna make up for the non uniqueness of the problem via an auxiliary stnadrd normal latent space ie a z where the generator gy maps z to x|y=y this means if there are many x possible the randomness will be controlled via latent space this is how one uses generative models to solve inverse problems,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cmR2eG9RVk5DY2xrRUtaUlQ4Q0FVU01NbmNTWFY1cUZuUGh1d2RCSkQ3VHBJbGljSzZ6azJaZ1RmX1hwSDJZaUVjS1pzMlc4U3B4RldGMm1RLW80U1g4c1o5MnZyOGhvWGhrYnRyUDZJTHM9

llms are bad at reasoning and planning leveraging multiple steps and delegating responsibilities lets you impose procedural mechanisms like youd find in a corporate structure that can promote quality and reduce risk from utilizing single agent responses directly this added complexity adds cost and latency moreover a lot of these complex systems are being built by people who dont have experience managing large teams coordinating complex projects or implementing systemic control mechanisms so the resultant systems may not be particularly effective,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5SGdtT1hPemNZb0VZcGlGbWRqVTA4WVctVy1fOHdFVmQ5clBkMFRNQW5jdjlLSnZXQTEzSFpUeTF0Um9nZ1FWencwS3lGQW5NUldrRUxnSFA5SFE2cmc9PQ==

i dont know particularly about multiagent llms as some comments here has mentioned but multiagent systems in general can be solutions to many current world problems that the tech world is tackling for example solving selfdriving when the vehicles perception is limited to its own features has reached some standard now but incorporate multiagent by allowing seamless communication between vehicles and voila you have agents that can perceive way longer range and through obstacles aided by another agents perception towards selfdriving it still might be a long way but i can see that such systems can already be very useful in confined regions like in parking with robots in warehouses etc agreed a lot of these challenges are probably already solved in theory but building actual systems for multiagent environments are bringing up new challenges like efficient fusion between different modalities even between same modality but from different vendors thereby different input distributions since they are not standardized yet i am curious what are some good pitches you have heard if you dont mind sharing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NFdob243SnJBZDNvSHYwVTJaeU1JVlZieWRfeUNZMHdMc2xhTjZpRlhJa1BxYWFoTmtVejJfN1haTG1GeFlfMWdkY0JiYU1uMDFrODQ0Rm5fNjQ4LWYtNHFMTUEtNHJ4cHlGYjhwNlU2LXc9

youll have to experiment with how you are chunking your data maybe add summaries in your vector db collection instead of actual data try to figure out ways to either split your data into smaller collections and add a logical layer thatll determine which collection to query try to convert the query into smaller sub queries employ some query expansion techniques to improve retrieval ive lately found a mix of hybrid search using sparse embeddings to be useful when you want better keyword focus in your search,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UVl1QkNTZTZtZ1l4aFBXODFlN19jbzBtbTNrQ3JBeFRUQkYydEJuSE80dFFhdlQyQ1lnVG84eDRTNVczdGRrZFhwbXpSYzZSNzJSU2UtWXdOZzBfa2c9PQ==

abstracting llms to agents creates the false illusion that there is somehow multiple different agents in reality an agent isnt the model but the specific context embedded in a prompt its still chatgpt just with different hats hats being the prompt the hype around agents is just the natural flow from abstracting from next token prediction to chat completion to agents at its core the abstraction is only valid when the model creators start training it specifically for an abstraction which goes counter to many peoples belief that an ensemble of agents can be enough to surpass the limitations of chat complete so to sum it ai agents are most likely the future considering llm makers are training models to be used in an agential use case much like how rlhf trains models for a chat completion use case the hype around agents however is misguided because it sees agents as a means to surpass current limitations rather than a useful abstraction for developing with llms,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5b0w0ZU1VYVNrTUFjSHZYTC03VXdSNHpSQ2NmV0VrSjJvRnBaYzdGNEJkbjZHamJEWHR1czNFc0d3Y0hyTGlwYTFNTDFLUVo5QjhFNFdkY1BhUm5pWGc9PQ==

some comments your charge out rate should be significantly above your salaryhourly rate to account for taxes deductions lack of benefits opportunity cost when i was working for a consultant i was charged to clients at roughly <number>x my base pay the ability to access a specialty skill set piecemeal without having to pay consultant rates or having to hire someone is quite valuable and your rates should reflect that they anticipate <number><number> hours but that may not be realistic since they need the skill set in the first place and so can likely not estimate it well make sure your consulting agreement specifies what they will deliver to you under the fixed component so you dont blow through your fees on donkey work only to have to complete the bulk of the work probono ie if they cant provide what is needed to carry out the work you can walk away from the contract and keep some of their money also in your agreement make sure there are significant charges for scope changes and set review points that release holdback payments for specific objective milestones moving goalposts is a very real thing in ml as people learn that <number><number> accuracy can leave lots of undesirable behaviour in the real world you dont want your pay to be contingent on completing a project to unrealistic standards,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5LUs4MjQ1a0o1dWlVbFUwb2tTZ0ZGN0xCenhZazhTcG9pcWdjMWRXc2VYeDNMR3A4WV9BQ0J2SjREbnFIcHgydDJkSUtWbjVaQnBBUFBINHpqUVltdXc9PQ==

after youve tried the classical methods check out some methods such as ddnm and dps for inverse problem solving on images these can work for general purpose inverse problem solving assuming you have access to the gradient of p your data distribution you can compute nabla pp = nabla log p otherwise known as the score function you can use that directly like these papers do without training a new generative model the general idea is to use principles of generative diffusion and build langevin processes that maximize probability subject to a constraint set specifically ddnm is actually very similar to a classical technique projected gradient descent but with some very crucial renormalization steps that maybe help it work this could help you get converging to local minima ddnm is also a bit smarter than projected gradient descent in that it uses the implied nullspace treating the optimization path as a stochastic process that corrupts the function f over optimization time dps is a bayesian method performing maximization using the identity px|y= py|xpxpy because we use the score nabla log px|y = nabla log py|x + nabla log px up to a constant since y is unaffected py|x is computed by means of an approximation known as tweedies formula this is not directly mentioned by the paper but is actually suboptimal since you have a ground truth for p i would estimate these methods should work very well without the need for any neural networks involved meaning everything more or less is classical with some renormalization happening links ddnm <url> dps <url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5V0lKUGJWbEcxRnVLU0diSTFHSk5FSVRBRW5zNXF2bWozcGNkNG91LUswVWUyR3g4Y0RIVEpUMm9kaG5fQkc2SjZqdVhlMm1iWF9ZVGJUMzZqSF9GbVE9PQ==

i would say that the statement llms are very poor reasoners would probably be common wisdom even in rmlscaling i mean the fact that current llms are poor reasoners has been documented literally thousands of times now but saying even an llm <number> orders of magnitude bigger than gpt<number> would be a poor reasoner is where youd run into disagreement another thing you might say is llms do notcannot reason at all not even a little bit they arent poor at it they just dont do it they cannot reason anymore than a bird can and sure that might also be controversial but current llms are poor reasoners everybody knows that<url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aC05RnBJOTJ0ZE9ndTRfY0xNOUZ3ZzNNQ1E5ZFhTczU4SFNLd1dMczgxZTdQbFZOTXlYblpxZWQwb0NzTjBteUltZDVDUVNjZUpuQVZvMzExV1NscWFTeEtsV3NLTnltTVNTWE51dml4Y0E9

hot take the people who invent sota methods generally do not understand them and are not necessarily the best at implementing them either machine learning is generally an experimental science mathematical analysis and proof usually comes after results not before them and i agree that in industry you definitely dont need a phd to do this kind of work i think companies are making a mistake when they prioritize hiring trained academics over other people,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5a2xVU2tLWFBodUJFZ0p3LXFvejhvOHBYY1ZOQmtMQlZ0WEdhMHpmeFZRQzdLRFpwSkdYUmlRZm1HTklibDJlRlE2RnZvdDhIbFZ2NnQ2al9kRVN3VFE9PQ==

your first suggestion is not correct these networks are value functions not classifiers your second suggestion probably wont matter in rl your third suggestion will almost certainly hurt theres a reason why no one uses dropout in rl source i have a phd in rl,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UndpTXlzUGtjZ3VUQVZPa3IzbWt1allTdl9KM29sNkZ2dmF5cHFUd2RJVm11TkxLR1FLTUx4V2R3VmVJa1ppUV9ERGR1R1I2TFhqWGI4Tk5rRlc0cXlDZjZOd1I0QlU2UFF1cFAyOEw5bjQ9
totally agree with you on pretty much every point but having a phd in rl seems irrelevant to the argument if anyone else is curious the reason dropout is unlikely to help is because most rl models are trained on data regimes where you can continually generate data samples dropout is helpful for preventing overfitting but overfitting is not as much of a concern when you have an essentially infinite data generating process models are unlikely to see the same sample many times so the chances of them overfitting is significantly reduced rendering dropout less helpful,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aWdmOTNFeHFGRU9pcUw5OEJIM01menRMR0hCTklJbVk2dWtDUlhLa0lKWFhYVllETVk1X05WOVFUZFFVR3RNYVpNNFNhRzNFYzJqekczTE9LRUFaM2c9PQ==

i think the biggest pitfall in applying models is that people often lack the statistical understanding of whats going on understanding the data generating process and how it relates to your model is very important even how you choose to split your dataset into trainvalidationtest is often overlooked or understanding that ml models trained on observational data will only learn predictive correlations which is not necessarily the same as causal predictions etc these things definitely dont need a phd to understand or learn but it does require a bit more than what youd get in a typical undergrad offering which means you either need to be a driven selflearner that excels in that or you pursue a graduate degree which offers more time and exposure to that world,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NkNYMDhpSnE2VmkwVy04SE1RZDJsWmhQbmU2Vlc4aFdPYXVoUmtiR3JVdHJBdmxSS3pDUXVhVHhDTWRHSXlfX3pVOXNWWlJ1Q3loa2lKRlVvcHBTQnc9PQ==

because of the nonbijectivity which is a common assumption in most ml algorithms i think you are bound to run into the problem of discovering multiple x i was going to suggest gaussian processes gps because you can obtain y=efx such that is a ef is a closedform mathematical expression given a y you can minimize rmseyefx using grad desc i only know the case of d y but there exist multioutput gps as well <number> if youre new to gps i have a blog post on it <number> but this wont solve the problem of only finding onesome x depending on the gd eg initialization learning rate i was also thinking along the lines of what thejpx<url> mentioned you can directly learn y>x however as a twist maybe you could preprocess the data to instead learn y> w where the w is distribution parameter that governs the many x you see for y cumbersome but might work depending on the context a fullblown extension this is to of course learn a generative model for x given y which you suggested it would be interesting to see how well this works because given a y the corresponding x might not have desirable clumping behavior ie you might have five x values producing the same y but they might be in different parts of the input space the only clumping behavior it will have is probably not the one you want points in the immediate neighborhood of one specific x refs <number> <url><url> <number> <url><url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5R3hxb1RLTzZSbERQMmoyR3VQR3cyRDlLNVhZSFFVMHVuSjRGYjM2SHk2X0JEX1FfaFBtRGlOWEdKV1NWOVZKS2RqOHpRUGdSLWlzYUIzeFBURzQ5TEE9PQ==

its worth reading the research paper if you havent i understand what you mean at the same time the way the researchers frame it llms are able to predict the next letter token based on patterns and contextual associations in their training data in this instance the llm is aiming to predict the next value in a point in time as a token based on patterns and similar associations in their training data effectively when you give it past data as basis to forecast it is kind of running the pattern it identifies against thousands and thousands of examples it has seen before kind of to predict the next value token it definitely has its limits and wont handle highly volatile trend lines well but for a decent chunk of forecasting scenarios it is kind of using an approach many people use already but just on a very manual basis,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cXlXODhmNExYejd5WkcwQ1M3UkRpNlFkM0d2TUdkdlJBWnZFcFdUSFJwUW5vXzd4QldnYmYteFFsYWlGY1pBVlVVajgzOUFMZ3F5YjZxR3B3T0JaVWc9PQ==

my problem with pretrainng for time series forecasting it is that time series forecasting is a completely different task for each dataset unlike nlpvision tasks that share similar knowledge and can be transferred across different tasks or domains this makes pretraining intuitively sensible for nlpvision tasks in the rare case where time series forecasting tasks share similar characteristics for example through visual inspection eg they have similar volatility levels like two datasets each representing the historical price of a stock the data may appear similar in many ways however can the patterns or knowledge learned from one be applied to another without introducing bias i think the answer is obvious another frustrating aspect of time series forecasting papers is that they often use meaningless metrics or compare to baselines in an unfair manner in reality the performance improvement is insignificant or just does not exist just my two cents on this topic,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MWhhT09lLVFzOTFZdVpObEpZN0VWZl9RWWRPUllyTjR4WThkNUllVFplZnZRTURQLXVQaVdiNzVWQmotMUFOUUlKbG4wNFN3UWV4NEZBaDk3OEJQMHc9PQ==

personally i value tmlr very high its relatively new sure but since it focuses on correctness rather than novelty there are thousands of papers each year on top conferences and we can all be <number> sure they contain a lot of mistakes just due to sheer volume and focus on novelty correctness fair evaluation solid benchmarking etc are much more important in my eyes especially since there are more and more papers debunking apparent progress in many areas of ml and showing that old models are still better if evaluated correctly,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5c2dSODkwc3A4LTZjcVFpckwybWx0bnkwRldoRHprb1lQbHFqNm5uWXFCX0VrM3dHam5ad09wcGhNLWhlRDVFbTRrZFFPbnE1ak5KV1dSakhHQlVSWFE9PQ==
honestly i dont see the point either i think the big added value in these type of settings is the function calling capabilities but i think that one llm that can hold all the project and prerequisite in the context window is going to give better results than a bunch of agents with a partial view of the problem and a narrow communication channel the multi agents paradigm may make sense when you cant fit all the information in the context window then separating missions by providing custom summaries make sense,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cUZ5MVhLSTdndmpadzRWdWs0a1RCNTBQQUdmaXNveG9SWEtqMDJGc3JoNVlQeUVvZVcwY3VOR1N2ekxEUFFxRHdGbnMzQ3JUT3RKbHpaS3NGRVV3Znc9PQ==
its maybe not flashy but its well respected if someone is judging your ability to do sound science theyll likely rate it as highly as a toptier conference paper for <number> of opportunities thats what you care about some fulltime research jobs may care more about your ability to come up with impactful research ideas but thats what you go to grad school to learn and practice,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5eXlMa2xkZFVMa0FLbDJ6V0gzcEdvdmN4VG9Mek1QTTUxeGlBendZelhWQ1pvbWkzV1lPc1RRLTV4bzhsLVpXdzNYaTNGMFhwdmE1UGpuQjh4cHJLdWc9PQ==
i agree that the function calling and orchestration to specialized models will stay for a while regardless of context window expansion in llms until the hallucination problem is reduced to negligible and there is no need for external verifiers in missioncritical settings what i was alluding to is that a chain of agents being orchestrated is separate from a multiagent connected agentic system the former has use while the latter seems only academic research the only place where i would see smaller agentic specific llms being usable is if in future there is a chance where localized private small lms can be placed on a persons device the inference costs have to go down significantly for that that has my entire lifes context embedded into it and that gets updated every now and then,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5dFhSZUFLMEhEcTFPNDhWOE9mY2VsRkhVY0dScmJwTmFNa1JQd3lsNk1rWk0xYnJzcVhxMTlnVzFOUW1wbmdWdGNJRUdaYW1IUGxMQ0VhNXZtaGNUQ1QwcjA5NWxVYTZZVzZKNEIyREctbGM9

speech in my opinion is not dead humans use speech to communicate more than text the field is hard and doesnt have the surge in popularity nlp and cv havehad but it is probably a matter of time until some big paper will change that like berttransformer did for nlp the main research direction i think speech needs to take is either a textless route dont use text in your pipeline which will be the main component in a text free robot or ai assistant the other direction is to go further into the multimodal option of text+audio and maybe imagesvideo,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NEhsSnpCX2lRYU9xNWc2ZFFoSWZXRUN2YnZmTzRsSzBUbzlSVGZsNEdlWVZRSnlRYVJZNGMwUjFnMHBBSVNLSlJMS1hCUllrbHdPdzVJbnVKWFpWVmwxdVBkS2tsdjZ6ZG50Rm5RdGlJRms9

i will just say my personal experience and opinion if you did improve on a problem then you should be proud of your work for sure its your first step having said that i had discussions about tmlr with other reputablecompetitive profs and i cant tell with certainty that tmlr is reputable especially on theory most profs that i know simply think it as a venue where they will send their work if they fail at top conferences or journals even if they dont tell you this because they want to be polite their actions tell a different story they always prioritize the most reputable places in my opinion what really matters is your performance at previous undergraduate and graduate studies and the universityties that you are coming from it all needs to indicate a riskfree hardworking person on paper the tmlr is nice to have but without consistency in grade performance it wont help much in top schools for sure it indicates that you are person who is willing to do independent work but this alone is not enough thats because willingness to do independent work without solid background means that you will need a lot of training to publish at top venues then it really depends on the prof if they are willing to invest in this or not,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MnphMU9DVXBWdkNSVzc0WlMwT0Rnd3dDMk9WNzlPODBZZUxIQ2NxVnBfRFVYVTNBMXpHT0dIWURGTEx3ZURlNU90QTl6ZHJxRmZwWFFJV0lJcjNmUW40Qm1IY19lY1NQeC1FUjZZeDU2N1U9

if the current trend continues we wont see stand alone audiotextimageother models in the future theyll all eventually be multimodal these models will require more resources to create and run than models that only do one thing but the advance of hardware and software efficiency will make stand alone models obsolete even though they use less resources this has happened with other technologies network hubs and switches used to live together on the network but the march of technology eventually brought the cost of switches so low that hubs became obsolete even though a hub would be cheaper than a switch if made today operating systems typically use d interfaces yet all modern operating systems use the gpu to render the display this was not the case in the early <number>s because gpus were still fairly expensive and the low cost integrated gpus were absolutely terrible rendering on the cpu had its own problems of being slow and having a low limit for ui elements if i recall correctly today every computer has a gpu and even the low powered gpus are more than enough to run the interface for an os it would certainly be cheaper not to need a gpu but the benefits of a gpu and the low cost mean nobody is going to do that were already seeing this happen with the integration of npus and equivalents into various platforms eventually every computer will have hardware acceleration for ai applications and a big pool of memory to run them no thanks to nvidia the benefits of a multimodal model are so vast that it wont make any sense to run something stand alone when both can be run locally a lot of stuff you might want to do with speech recognition will just be part of the model already not made directly but a consequence of training on tons of data,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5T2duUUxTakxaQnNCZElJMjMyQlR3eG1qMGlScTcwakZmcWt6Wl9YRWU0Qk5fa3REZzZsWFFjQ085cXpod2RuaF9paXFWNDlCY3pjVHdGellrbkNobGc9PQ==

my masters advisor spoke with an important person in openai about gpto and while he didnt get a full explanation beacuse it is top secret the person did imply that gpto is not a full end to end textless model i have no idea how true that is and how textless the model is but that is my understanding also i would be very surprised with the current state of the textless community if gpto is truly textless and is not just a pipeline of multiple things most research shows we are fairly far off from textless models even if gpto is truly a textless model it is still closed so it makes sense that the open source and research community continue perusing this path even if openai did achieve that the most likely possibility is that gpto is a multi modal pipeline with multiple models which makes both of my paths very viable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6cDdiU0RJM2gteWlHMVQ0ZGo2N3pOSk5NRXltVEUtNHduTl9BZ2xDN3BmOGIycW9wNEhObkpDSVR1OF95aVdMLUpaQU5LN1h2V21IV3M1N3llZ3hKUmFxN0VHcFpZR0MyNVdVdGdqakl3NkU9

multi agent is necessary because the llm doesnt have the attention to be consistent with all your rules and instructions your instruction could be mildly contradicting or vague which would result in a breakdown during execution having smaller agents with strongly scoped inputs and outputs allow the system to troubleshoot itself quickly and parallelise independent tasks its difficult because a lot of assumptions we have as humans is not inherent in an llm or agent you want to clearly define the exception handling for the most part because otherwise might result in an endless loop of bad decisions with no instruction to terminate it in a good state to give you an example when i played around with the old chat gpt <number> it was correcting its code by incrementing a number in the function name checking if it worked then incrementing again and loop while its a very neutral action an endless loop breaks the whole process loop newer models dont do this anymore but the loop complexity becomes less obvious from the observer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6MG45RWdIUVBRVktISHNsMmMzT0gtS0xhbjA1LUowOWc3QWF6cGVEMUpvY0o1blBLOHcwX0ZHcU8tWGhpa0lZTmhPM0JxYkJHZk5Rb3AyVHJEX3I5eUE9PQ==
this is so wrong it is insane i am starting to think you are projecting your own insecurities on me audio as a sequence is much more complex than text a second of audio is usually <number> samples and we dont work with a second if audio if we want a conversation we would like minutes or even hours that means that you need to tokenize it while a similar approach to images has been tried take patches and learn some embedding with some success it doesnt achieve the results images or text achieve beacuse audio is more complex when we speak we have pitch we have duration we have style and humans use all of those features to understand each other most methods we have seen in audio are able to get some of those features from the audio eg hubert some methods use multiple features from the audio eg use hubert and get pitch using some other algorithm and train a model using both but there really isnt a good way to tokenize audio in a way that gurentees you have all the features most recent methods use like <number> or <number> parts of a pipeline to get all the features they want and this of course makes training very hard you can look at this paper <url> which is very likely similar to what gpto is using if someone would be able to create a tokenizer that is able to give you one token that contains all of the features and simplifies the pipeline it will push audio very far this has nothing to do with attention,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6TVMxV2Fvdmg1Rk83alkzNTZWU2tQb1pQT3lWVDR5U29xTU1hd0tWZWpIVVNGT1dRSjBHci12RmROU0JqeU5GSXVxY0tULWVWR1FTelpEdzF4WFcxVndaNlFEVmFPdUxYbzNEakF0M2RVWEU9

i use the models locally with own code there is only so much you can parallelize if you have only one gpu to get coherent speech you need to process at least one sentence at a time if the first sentence is <number> seconds long and the model isnt fast enough for realtime you have at least <number> seconds latency before you can start playing the audio but even worst is that in this case you have to process enough sentences that the resulting audio is longer than the processing time for the rest of the sentences with longer text passages you get really long delays with a model that is faster than realtime you can start playing the audio after the first few sentences depending on the individual lengths of the first sentences then you have only a short delay which should be workable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1X1VyYWYtNkVjdlFIM1ZQNHVpSTVRVngxV1VjaTRtcVdRSnZqek43QjhoYV95YkJLb3ZlcFpTa2dVcU10ejN2dFlrbDN6d09GTXFrSjJYSzRBNlZVN0JYVURoa0hIQVBKMk5XeHY0ZTJ4LUU9

idk exactly what you mean by upper bound here maybe care to elaborate my point is that stttts or io specifically for high resource languages not only are the most profitable applications but also have been tackled for years its hit diminishing returns at this point that doesnt mean there arent a plethora of other speech applications needing qualitative advancements for meeting actual industry adoption actual speech representation learning for multimodal settings is still an open question because untangling phonology paralinguistics biometry and nonspeech is tricky plain stt for feeding llms works for a lot of practical applications and this probably subtracts a lot of the perceived value on more in depth research but tech wise its basically a silver tape approach when compared to how images are processed and encoded in bleeding edge lmms,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Smk2eVdHTUM4OHN4TjF5TFB3QWRRYkVQTzNqaUp6bEM4RV8tWmdoM2N2RGtrUHl4ZmRUUGtLT2ItTFM2T25GZF9nV3pJUHJNSW5LYkd1V2k5WDlVWE9pZmpCcExULTdJa05FcHBCN3lIVW89

at a high level its a maximum likelihood estimate for the parameters of something with gaussian measurement errors gaussian errors are expressed mathematically with exponential functions of yamusigma^<number> a maps parameters of your model to measurements multiple error terms are then multiplied to get the probability of a given set of mu values for given set of observations y that mess is nonlinear so you take the log of the likelihood which has the same optimum point as the likelihood but causes the product of exponentials to become a sum of squared errors the optimum of the sum of squared errors is found by setting its gradient to zero which gives you a nice easily solved linear system for the maximum likelihood estimate in the particular case where your measurements and means are related by a linear operation when you use a different probability distribution than gaussian the above process changes because you no longer have a sum of quadratic functions a common approach is to use mestimators and solve them with iteratively reweighted least squares when your measurement function is not linear it also doesnt work directly but you can often use nonlinear least squares which approximates the solution as a sequence of linear least squares problems but in a different way than for non gaussian errors above and of course you can combine the two to have nongaussian errors for nonlinear measurement functions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1cFVseTFDeHhEcGpTalp0ZTQtU2V0QWFSbFpLS3VjaERJX0paMUJ1dDlwTW11dFo3TmdZLU5EYzl0U3BkZVc2OEpuaFU4ZzEtVzdQUHI5WWMzVkdhQWc9PQ==

it depends a lot on the problem the data and the model in most machine learning tasks where you do a point forecast your observedtruth y is a random sample of the true but unknown data distribution usually conditioned on some input variables x you try to forecast y which is in fact a forecast of some property of the data distribution conditioned on x dependent on your loss your model trains to forecast different properties of the distribution l approximates the expectation value mean l approximates the median keep in mind that those estimates are also random variables because your finite amount of input data is also considered a random sample roughly l will be less sensitive to outliers but the median may not be what you want to predict depending on the problem,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1UnZSXzdyQ1h4cUQ5THJFWi1tRFpnVUV3QWhBR09SYUdid2tVVTJjYjBYMGx4dmNjRHZOVVBUaHdST2oxR0g4emNBb1BkOVJpUjljczB4NW5vZ0lKUmc9PQ==

the biggest reason is that minimizing mse means your model predicts the conditional expectation ey | x but minimizing mae means your model predicts the conditional median mediany | x that is the main thing you should be considering when deciding between the two do you want your model to predict the conditional mean or the conditional median everything else is much less important or relevant,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1MzgzTjBiQ0dQTFduUEItM2xPYXhjc252amdkaWpya0hPbXpYUEZYcFF6YmR2dVZEN1k1UlNxczllWkVvSUh2U0dSWVdRYkRGaEotT0luUEJmQVpBTEE9PQ==

minimizing a squared error estimates a mean which is where the objective function comes from in the first place specifically gauss introduced the method of leastsquares to estimate a normal mean but the assumption of normal errors isnt strictly necessary here the mean is precisely the value which minimizes the sum of squared deviations to the sample values and so once youve decided that youre interested in the mean as a measure of location then youve implicitly accepted that the variance ie the average squared error is the right measure of spread,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Q1kteUJMYXpVR1dmdDItU09pZ04td2R2QW5DTmkta0VvdEd5eXlfd1VCMW5tdl9XdnZMVHdKU2ZuUVk1LUtLQVBpd2JidjVaLVlIZTJaaVphQWI3WVE9PQ==

i dont understand the precision bits is determined by the hardware fp can have more rounding errors and higher quantization than fp no when they accumulate during the operation time doesnt this lead to a degradation of the accuracy if so i would like to know if there is a significant difference in accuracy so that it isnt hardwareagnostic anymore what do you mean with <number> deterministic you can always produce errors with functioning hardware regarding floating points no,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1REdEODFMTXFRVHdJZ0s5clFxeVhfLVZ4b2JRbFY3aXNGMXozNXlhejVUZUJWSHJBUUlQZ2R3cjhMMTVGZmhYQWF0bGdxUzZvODdRelUzQ1gxanIwV0ZlUFdWVVZfcVVBMzJrWHFSZWJtcHM9

i think there is always going to be some minor non determinism when running on a gpu but i dont know how much that would affect the overall answer in the end because floating point addition is not associative due to rounding errors and a lot of operators using atomic add with cuda where threads might write to a sum in different orders on each inference we can get slightly different results,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YnJNc242VWRqeHdBNWgxcGp2VU9lVlpYLVBvS2JBRlVaNURqam5sMmVEeExQd2dIV0xKTERIRk9lX2dpNFVZVjhERmpFLVgxX2FXX29DRnV4dkY3aGc9PQ==

just keep in mind that the same model may not be capable of running on different hardware an average modern neural net is probably too big to fit on a phone so you may have to eg use a quantized version of the model that quantized version is a different model so it will have different accuracy but its not the hardware causing different accuracy its the quantization,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1RXFkNGhlOThIMGxoeVM5dXRqOVJJWENYM1FueURtY1ZrRUFfYTFiNEtEVF83SVJCNHJfQnh2QU1CMTVHaFJ2S3JYR0Y2U3oxaHl3ZmlBOFZFOVRHQVphX0QwWkhkMTFkbEdRZlVCaVc0WkE9

i said this on another comment the average of a set of numbers minimizes the mean squared error between the mean and the points i asked chatgpt to write a proof this isnt the reason mse is commonly used but it is related and the proof may give you insight why the average mean of a set of numbers minimizes the mean squared error mse heres a proof consider a set of numbers x x xn the mean average is given by mean = x + x + + xn n we want to minimize the mean squared error mse with respect to a value a the mse is defined as msea = <number>n x a^<number> + x a^<number> + + xn a^<number> to find the value of a that minimizes the mse we take the derivative of msea with respect to a and set it to zero dmseada = <number>n a x + a x + + a xn = <number> simplifying this we get a x + a x + + a xn = <number> now factor out a a n x + x + + xn = <number> solving for a we get a = x + x + + xn n so the value of a that minimizes the mean squared error is the mean of the numbers therefore the mean minimizes the mean squared error,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZnpsZktfSDF5RlZISU5sa0Jza2lBcUhra25rdlRCdjRNVnoteDlyakFfdUM5X21EWnlhaEVlTVg0M2otXzNybnRBdXh3dVlIbVpzWjFjblJ1blJ6VEE9PQ==

a phd will almost never hurt your chances of getting a job the lack of other qualifications can though eg not having an mba lacking experience in a certain role etc doing a phd carries with it opportunity cost in that respect but thats true of any career choice you will make the only negative thing that ive ever heard with respect to having a phd is some people saying that people with phds are difficult to work with there arent too many people like that but if you happen to run into one you can safely regard that attitude as a red flag these are usually people who have spent their entire careers in private industry and who have only ever seen ways of making decisions that are authoritarian andor poorly thought out and they become frustrated when someone wants to be more collaborative and deliberative in making decisions if you meet someone like this you should know that the problem is with them not with you,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WDJ1U3l6WWNfTHVvSnhmU3RjX1FUSTdrYkhNcnZ1b3ctbTRBQTJIWVVyTkV6Yk1kYmhGYVJaUnByR2JpVjV4Q2gwWlpHVk01OFJydWE4cVFpMmtTWEE9PQ==

id be shocked if floating point errors actually mattered that stuff only comes up when you use discontinuous functions in some sense nothing in an llm should have a derivative on the order of <number>^<number> which is what youd need to make the errors in float arithmetic relevant you could maybe imagine a scenario where that happens especially if you use halfprecision but llms are typically designed to avoid exactly that kind of thing because it makes training unstable in the first place thats what normalization is,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NHZhVXRpUzJ0MlViZEl5U0l6M1dubndLSDNSRHJmWlV6cDNZei1hNmxiM2hlQ1JDbUtGMDZOd1JGamVPUXJWcDBkQm9KbER3UjRqbXNWcG5LSjg0N1NVNXNNdk9BVFUzZTR3RWJzMGlwZXM9

it depends on how detailed you want to get but if you run two identical models from pytorch on two different devices they very likely wont be bit for bit identical at their outputs on the flip side if you controlled exactly how something like a matmul was written for both devices assuming they both comply to ieee specifications and you dont compile with unsafemath enabled you can probably expect the same results but the point is that most of the community doesnt operate at that level and pytorch and other frameworks arent nearly prescriptive enough to ensure this behavior the world is incredibly muddied especially once you get into fpbfloat eg is accumulation happening at bfloat fp tensorfloat etc nothing in the model dictates this behavior,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ckJuZFB4RkJpaldmRU9EeWxBbGZZek83dkxZb1h5WjJVclM1NnRMZTdMM2d4cmNYOGZnVXMzbmRUUnQxVWV6eWZuOVIzelllaDhpS0lNSldraXhfN2c9PQ==

i think they mean that it can restrict you from non research roles ive heard stories of phds dissatisfied with research and wanting to switch to ml engineering not get considered because employers think they are just temporary positions for them i would say all ml research is technically backend but research skills does not necessarily translate producing clean and maintainable code these are skills byyou usually pick up with work experience this could also put you at a disadvantage,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZGthTTQ4bHljSjZkRC03Zkl5cEF0V3JMZERRS2ctTnZzaDJ0ZHNoakVnZVhaS2pkZTNKOVpTODdIM0U3dHUyRk1TQTQ2d1cyeGtQVjRCUWx4ejdFZWlKbFRRVnVmRXU4UWp2UnlnRXpucVk9

so in my experience the biggest issue with a phd is working with people who come out of academics thinking they know everything or viewing themselves above certain people or tasks the issue with this is when you tell them that your quality of work is not up to par with what is needed a lot of times they argue or push back rather than taking time to learn how to create good solutions i have worked with many phd holders and when i start mentioning other ml techniques or better ways to implement this solution i generally either get a defensive response or an unwillingness to learn ive ran into phds who dont even know how to use a debugger or how to quantize and optimize their models inferences i would not say a phd holds you back from certain jobs but understand that the other side of the interview table has probably been burned by many of these people of course not all are like this but this seems to be somewhat common,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1RG9XV3RNMjZRckRUTWlzY3JnelZwZ2lGOFVyblU4SWtZc1lqMWNSanBLcDMyTk1VcjFBbU00VVFrUlJjUWh0ZVBTQ3pPV3h5SjcyTmU2ZkdTZGV2WWc9PQ==

> but it just never happens and in practice l loss has a nicer behavior ehh for most tasks you can treat it as a hyperparameter swap out ll and do whichever works better for just about every regression task ive worked on l works better and im guessing most reseachers find the same which is why you see it so much more often than l in papers the derivative of l is the magnitude of the error whereas the derivative of l is just a constant your learning rate this means your updates when doing gradient descent with a l loss are going to be constant no matter how far off your prediction is whereas l will give you bigger updates if your predictions is further off which is usually what you want this also makes l a lot more susceptible to oscillation problems if your prediction is just slightly too high youll get a big update and then next epoch it will be too low and repeat back and forth meanwhile l will give you smaller updates as you close in on the minima the main use case where l is nice is when you expect some samples to be so far off that the huge updates youd get from l would screw up your model but usually gradient clipping can sort that out,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1M0hHUTA4by1zZGIxQjFaS1hfb1RzZ1E1QXh4Njl1S3plQktoUFpHLUVINXpBQU1pM201VUFDNU9VaXlfYVRURDVMR3A4ODFMZXdoMjE1Ym95RWdiNGc9PQ==

i think there are a lot of people like that without phds too everyone needs to eat humble pie in order to develop professionally some people just need a bigger slice than others i think if theres one especially common feature that comes with someone having a phd its that theyre not convinced by dismissive or evasive reasoning and that clashes with a private industry culture that is rife with dismissive and evasive methods of motivating labor im not necessarily saying youre one of them but i think a surprisingly large number of managers have a difficult time working with direct reports who want goodhonest reasons for the work theyre doing and who insist on having input into how their work is done,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NUFLT2EtSEVPT2t5MXJTS182VlhpUUtWa2lzODlKeS1taTE1TU5XUElIeHREWWZGZU9PUlVkcldVcmZhRlR5alMtUlp4RUhRT3pvaGNDSjhUSU04UXc9PQ==

to explain it simply you define <number> agents one maker agent with the instruction for example learn the spanish language this will generate an output then you have another critique agent with all your criterias for a good output for example the output should be able to translate my <number> examples if it cant explain why it cant then the output is returned back to the first agent and it tries to fulfil the flaw and then back to the critique agent so this process loop can happen without labelling because midway through the loop it will start creating its own labels create bad labels and self rectify the labels when it cannot fulfil the criteria of course you would still kick start this process with some good materials and instruction for example a instruction book on learning spanish as context note you would also need to convert the alphabet in the language to an embedding as well which is just a number representation network of a language this can be created from just digitalised books and books of the language all you need is processing power time and the incentive to do it why you dont put both instructions in the same agent because the instructions and criterias may sometimes be contradictory which limits the generative aspect and itll get stuck in a saddle point solution its the same reason why sales and quality control arent the same person as human employees you could also split the maker and critiques into multiple smaller agents such as grammar agents vocab agents etc but it will still follow the makercritique workflow,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1cWlBekhnU2htRTAwbjhyQnROaXZOaGtEUmVTYUgtek93X0RwRmJJTGc3TndYUlYxdFJqV05sTkR0R3BoVDRrRDRLWkVIdno2X3dDVFRkUFluZy1KNFE9PQ==

hi everyone im working on a neural network that can generate audio for doubletrack guitar effect essentially the network should take an audio recording of an electric guitar and modify it to sound like a second take of the same part like the guitarist was told to record the part twice this is a very common practice in rockmetal music because it makes guitar sound wide you pan take a to the left and take b to the right and get the stereo effect the problems are <number> i dont know what kind of neural network to use i am preparing a dataset where i have a lot of tracks a and b where a and b are two takes of the same guitar part so i probably need a network that learns how to convert source track into target track <number> i dont know how much dataset i need im planning to obtain at least <number> hours of tracks a and b both and feed it to the network in a combination like a>b + b>a so it doubles the dataset maybe use some augmentation to experiment with different pitch and playback speed <number> i dont know if the task is even possible there are no solutions like this in the internet which means it is either impossible or not in demand to bother except the algorithmic doublers which suck compared to real double tracking a difference between real double tracks are note startend timing articulation attack timefrequency response and human error these cant be properly simulated with the pitchtime randomization thats why i want to make this network i am new to machine learning so any feedback is appreciated,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R2FndkowWXZuc2k4YzNtU1ZUV2NfTEZfOWtibUNicTFzTDdPNEMyWW45T1BaVzV5ZzljNXZxSHVsQXRuamRkTmhVTkZGYkhadmRQNEE3Znl1cWNOQWc9PQ==

cool question not that i know of it feels like a bit too advanced which probably means someone will launch a tool next week but there has been a lot of work done on simulating and refining motion in robotics you have probably seen videoen of randomly built robotic limbs that tries to figure out the best way to use its physical capabilities to incrementally improve its mobility same with models to improve aerodynamics etc understanding and describing the physical properties of the world an area that has been heavily research machine vision in robotics self driving cars as an example or pick and place robots that learns about the world through manipulating physical objects the closest thing i can think of right now might be to use a combination of chatgpt or similar to create code to build d models in blender you can input python code that generate d objects and motion but to create a functioning prototype and to actually test that prototype in a useful manner is a different beast alltogether if this is just for fun you should just try asking some generative ai to dream up an image you will probably just get gibberish but try asking it to create a schematics of a new way to chop wood,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1c3ZmSkNDNGV0bzRyb1g3NVBhN0ltYnFWekQ5Q01ReEVXZlhKLWFGbmpLV2RJZENZZDZmV1ZuOUZKSlpBRjlqN0RTdU8tT3J1RFpPRFdFSHJIanlzeVE9PQ==

you are underestimating how many businesses are not interested in using machine learning solely for prediction tasks while conventional machine learning tasks today often lean more towards engineering rather than modeling this isnt the case for all applications for instance tasks involving causal inference such as understanding churn or even just working with data from a natural experiment require more than just a off the shelf model in these situations where causal models are necessary the ml default pipeline wont work my opinion is that you and op are describing the work of a data engineer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1bzNEbHoxd19ZWmFNTVZkcFNkaGVPazhvcHFNSHFIekpPZnB2S0tmbXljblI2dS1qVERpUDhDbmktV19ZUFFBWFdFdG9EXzhSb1ZhN3duVWd1NTFNLUE9PQ==

disclaimer personal opinions from someone actually hiring these roles and building these systems at a high level you are confused everyone on this thread is confused are you an ml engineer if you only use pre trained models no absolutely not do ml engineers build new architectures also no absolutely not finetuning and changing hyperparameters are also totally different things different still from training a model from scratch different still from building a model from scratch different still from developing new architecture generally researchers are responsible for exploring new architectures they do not do it from scratch very very few researchers will every build a modern nn from scratch the same way a web developer wont usually make a web framework from scratch when they replace a part of their stack ml engineers are then responsible for the ops which is usually training and inference training both includes foundation models from scratch and finetuning an ml engineer will generally have a small number of hyperparameters that they can change like batch size and quantization but almost all of the parameter tuning is done by researchers or automated systems this is different from finetuning if the only thing you can do is run inference then thats just regular software engineering,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TU95UTlOekRBbUVlRTBoTlRBdnpHQjZYSUV5NVJXZGJBU0ZfSENZUEdGRXQ2TzQ4VUdMTkdUU2lSM2JyX0dzVVNIei1MbFVQYlNFWjNWOUZRVFkyVnc9PQ==

to be fair up until recently ai was narrow but superhuman think deep blue or watson on jeopardy it couldnt do much else but it could nail a problem llms are pretty decent at a large dataset of language thats on the other dimension not an expert but kinda decent at answering questions on the plot we have a point on the top left and bottom right but nothing in the top right i suspect the models behind these two successes arent compatible enough to slap together yet and get a super human language using bot additionally we havent gotten to the point where we discuss what intelligence really is how we learn with less how we are different from other animals that have bigger brains thats a whole different conversation that ai isnt ready for yet,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1bGRRZ2NzMXcwVS10bUs5RWo5c2VPYkNOZ3JjUXVmaUVEc3lVYS16RWU2M1o4UGRISlo4S1dYS2FaNmZfdXE4SG5kcHlUU1lfV3htWVU1WFdvWjkwQVE9PQ==

if the model outputs copyrighted content thats a separate potential copyright violation from training on the copyrighted data someone the person who distributed the model is serving the results of the model both im not sure would presumably be liable for that copyright violation if it occurred there are still factors to consider such as <number> did the model quote minimally from copyrighted material for the purpose of commentary or analysis or does this otherwise fit into fair use exceptions <number> if not what damage was done copyright violation isnt a crime its a tort you dont go to jail but rather just pay damages to compensate the injured party which means there has to be an injured party in some cases people have demonstrated that if you produce enough of a bit of work to prove that you have it sitting in front of you the model will pick up and prove that it has memorized and can reproduce the same thing thats interesting and proves the model is potentially capable of violating copyright but if no one was injured by the experiment its unlikely to be a problem on its own that said there are definitely cases where a model does reproduce copyrighted material in a way that is not fair use and injures someone and this certainly violates copyright thats a very different question from whether training the model is a copyright violation the question of whether training the model violates copyright is still being considered so its hard to say anything definitvely but its at least very plausible that as a matter of law it may be decided that it just isnt learning from and applying the generalized knowledge gained from content in many ways strikes at the very core of fair use of copyrighted content,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WnJ5NDRGbUNoTHpQMnBZdHdNUDVXQ1FfVE81RDNlbS1STFhlYW4xNmJHOEFQQlY3WlFYem5hU3VQYkN4TUQyZnppemtpZi1SV0phWE9oSy1GTkZkQXc9PQ==

i think its very likely that training sets that are scraped from the internet do respect robotstxt not doing so would require someone to go out of their way to build or modify scraping tools to avoid respecting these policies and there are a number of reasons that would be a dumb thing to do not only would it expose the company to liability but it would also add lots of garbage content into the training set thats far outside the distribution they want to learn and given the tiny amount of actual humanreadable content thats excluded in this way it would likely do far more harm than good to the quality of the result,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1V1VCTnQyNGh5RGFVSUw4dGRLalhDX0xEc1Z4TmlwZ3VvZmhCNTcwYkNybnNEU25Ha1JobVZnWE5PVlVleG1qd2piYTBkVEVLZmtGR2UyUUdCZFJQVlE9PQ==

i think theres an easier way to do this use a generative model like a diffusion model the steps go like this <number> train a model that generates guitar tracks by doing y=fx where x is a sample from a noise distribution and y is the guitar track you dont need a custom dataset of doubletracks for this you just need a regular dataset of guitar tracks <number> to make a double track of a track a calculate x = f^<number> a and then do b = fx+d where d is a noise sample with a very small variance the result of this should be that b is similar to a but slightly different and if the generative model is trained well then it will be different in a way that sounds natural i think most audio generative models are probably using latent diffusion so to do f^<number> a what youd actually do is use the encoder network from the autoencoder instead you might not even need to train your own model there might be open source musical instrument track generators out there that you can just use out of the box and get reasonable results with in principle theres nothing wrong with your original plan but the challenge with it will be that you probably cant get enough data to make it work well and acquiring the data is time consuming and difficult better to use other methods that can take advantage of easily acquired data or open source models you can also use fine tuning with your custom dataset if the initial results with the above method dont seem good enough you can get away with a lot less data when doing fine tuning,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WG5MZEY3SnJmeTBQSlBseVcxTURaUWJqOGttLWZ6c3FVelRmQ2JELV9kc2w2dWhnLUFOREtTSmN2LTItTzlXUVdRMjlTRlFjcTZlQVFZejlpZ1MwaWc9PQ==

title d can system <number> thinking be derived from notepad tool use for sufficiently strong llms post body hopefully the title is clear sub question is why is this not being targeted by big ai right now ive basically arrived at the conclusion that we may be able to have system <number> thinking built out of system <number> thinking from the llms and notepad tool use allowing them to iterate on a logical argument i want to be clear that i am skipping over some expected post training for structured outputs and tool use formatting whats confusing for me is that the greater ml community is signaling this isnt an option the signals im receiving are lack of discussion about this concept and a sizable consensus that llms are not enough to reach agi when i attempt to anticipate why this is occurring for signal one i keep arriving at this strategy having been considered and then disregarded for some wellinformed but unknown reason because i find low probability that this is a novel concept for signal two i think this comes down to a miscommunication where two groups of people are unable to see each others point i am in the camp of llms are enough to get us to sufficiently advanced intelligence for economic work in broad range of domains but when i say this what i really mean is that llms provide the special sauce and llms or oomswhatever along with some other structures will get us there i think some evidence for my conjecture being correct would be the effectiveness of cottot prompting which coerces the model to simulate portions of this strategy in some sense tot prompting would require much less effort from the llm when it is able to build these structures and then set them aside without needing to manually persist them in its next output i would love to hear discussion about this and am <number> open to being gently informed about this research or how to do this research on my own,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZHl3bzlKNUhqRFpONllBb0JYcGh4MW1DTUdHOHJUN1oxdXlqMjFaWVZyMXFnVVg0dE9va01Zcjc4aW5wMVBNSlFQenRpdkNpRGZ4Q2Q4WjlxZzRuUUE9PQ==

i personally think that it is poorly named it is not an abstraction benchmark it is a geospatial reasoning benchmark it looks abstract but the problems often rely on geometry understanding perspective gravity topology things that are hard to learn from a huge text corpus but that are not particularly abstract i kind of expect vision + rl models to be all thats needed,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1aThiZDA5WlZkUmhVSEFEMDRMdTZndHFlazJZNUtxOUxoQWs3UE9FS2EzUVJJb2w1d2JEZkgxWFZLUWw4aFdsODNEYWNYUVVmTkdJQ3VJSk1Qc3ZBdUE9PQ==
the approach that has worked best on arc so far is program synthesis you have some domainspecific language with primitives like countcolors or mirrorshape and you look for compositions of these primitives that given an input grid return the output grid see for example <url><url> subprograms are partial programs often the search algorithm would discover the same subprograms for many different tasks for example stack two grids on top of each other and take the elementwise difference if you can identify such subprograms ie keep what they have in common and make whatever is different into an argument of the function thats an abstraction which you can add to the language so you dont have to rediscover it from scratch next time its needed,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NXpPdkxDOFQtQ01XTmI4X3h1cVVqR2NfNUQ2S2RHVlFiaDRiMm1aZUhxamZZcXBlVXV6Q2IySjYzbHpoX05YSm9jdzluZFlUUm1vUHRaWDhISkJRZUE9PQ==

i think we should be very wary of proclaiming a problem that we dont currently know how to solve as being an ultimate test or describing them as agicomplete it may turn out that this benchmark is not solvable without true generalization or it may turn out that there is some other technique that is sufficient to solve it but turns out to be taskspecific we wont know which until after we see the system that conquers it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1eDFSSHM2M3J0cG1aVlh6U1hSTU5ZLW45SlVheHI5bWdFRzd4VWZXWXU3WE9PSVNiWUR3bFNmeG14Z0loU2htUS05OURMV2RyRTdtMVVaOU9qaFVmZlE9PQ==

i feel bad for the <number> persons who did upvote it i am still trying to figure out though how the hell they manage to use gradient descent to train ternary weights something just feels off there but this time ill do more reading before stating bluntly something wrong i came upon this remark > assuming all dense layer weights are ternary we quantize q and k resulting in a ternary attention map that eliminates multiplications in selfattention however as shown in fig <number> the model trained this way fails to converge and then they switch the matmulless rnn implementation which i guess is still interesting but a bit underwhelming as i suspect the problems of regular rnns likely subside in ternary ones it is still an interesting read and i like the idea of faking a gradient thats convenient when the function is not smooth but replacing too many gradients with identity function feels like it defeats the very purpose of machine learning,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1a21vT2hkR0RIclBCcmU3WWtBbHRXSndtRnREcU1FRUdEbW5iOVp4LXJhNVVrSjRfMDB0NkNxVWZZUFRYaFVYTWpJUk5mSV9jZ2FTdjFFanNJV19vSEE9PQ==

maybe there is a uniqueness between images that allows for cycle consistency but as a general point there are often many bijections between two highdimensional marginals i can learn many different ways to rotate then stretch and shear a circle into an oval but if there is only one mapping which is the true mapping how do i learn that one im mainly interested because i would like to find where i can apply this to a numerical domain but if there is no good answer to that and the answer is because in the image domain there is only be one mapping im probably out of luck edit changed infinite to often many bijections as thats more accurate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1UFlJTHRjRWRSMUViYS1KTi1nakozbkRfejZNZGotM2NqVmxEcVdCSjVVeFRzU0RJVVFaY2M1Y25IUkFsY2I2WFhQZDI2bnZfQ083OEU1NkhGUmtiVGc9PQ==

this question is central to ica and is called identifiability you wont be able to learn the true mapping without placing restrictions on your function class because as you said there are an infinite number of bijections between distributions another place to look is in the optimal transportschrodinger bridge area there you look at continuous time flows and place restrictions on your flow using a value function this is particularly useful if your bijection has some physical interpretation like if the samples from your distribution represent particles in space and you want to transport them in an efficient way,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WDE5bkFLTnROd1hkOHlqZENQdmlFLW9NN1FzbWU1dlJULWhWb2dUczFrVUoxMm9aampjeFl6MjVyWExDZlNjYklIZjg5eVV1bllCRVUwVHJoM1djeHR1Q0ZqRlltLWNXZ09QcGs1OFJHTWM9

cool i will look at ica and identifiably its always been something i wanted to learn but never got around to before it before it became somewhat out of fashion you say you wont be able to learn a true mapping without placing restrictions how does cycle gan do it then is the space of images somehow restrictive enough for the bijection to be the only bijection or maybe the easiest bijection from an optimization perspective is somehow the right one,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1WGQ1Tm85VDl0NWZ2UXhqcEExaldPYXFQdFFQeVA5eFRlS2NiMFVScEtfSnZHbHA0Mlc4NG0tSExidEYyTlRwdFV1ZGJEUnRkYm12N0pDVV9KM3lJOWc9PQ==

this is cool would the following interpretation be correct a value is maintained per weight to record the amount of signal received thus far signal below a certain strength is ignored probably noise after a number of steps the weight loses its plasticity creating a tradeoff between forgetfulness and ability to learn new concepts a potential next step would be to investigate how this idea of signal and plasticity can be extended to higher level structures eg an entire layer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1RHE1QnBoWjFNLVUzWi1YbGVrRDVnX1Y2VUlKQUNEek1lZXhSMVJCdkQ0RloxMzBrU1h6WUdtSnlZOTdRbDBISGF4N29Zd3JSaG42U0RKS2o0eVIzRmc9PQ==
it is not a bad thing but what i think he is referring to is that the challenge advertises that large pretrained transformers have reached a limit do not generalise because they cannot solve this dataset robustly ignoring that these models have solved a range of tasks which <number> years were believed to be quite hard,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1djBqVFEwdm9CaXQ1SnkyM2loRUJzb2pLcFU1UFkxUGJ6OWhpV1ZwNkpxUDlxLU9JdzBPcy1CTFJXb2FqT094LWN0Z2ZCRjl1VXhTQnVTUTc3d0dRdEE9PQ==
if you can formulate the task as a <number> player game you can use selfplay to build up the knowledge of these kinds of tasks all you need is some way of scoring any randomly generated answer ie how close is your answer to the actual correct solution i believe it shouldnt be too difficult to design a mechanism for scoring answers how many pixels are correct etc you have two ais submit answer for each of the <number> questions and give them a score for each submission and the winner is whoever has the highest score at the end then repeat just like alphazero,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZEp1SHotc1o3NXl2VU85Y3ZPeEdlYnE3OXZQUTBJY3B3OV85QzQ0V3NfQ0FzVUFXREZ6NmxzeE83cXA0RG1iMHhCT3gyaGhJWTlUdUhLdVFvRmplTUE9PQ==

hi im an author of grokking as the transition from lazy to rich training dynamics <number> which appeared at iclr earlier this year there we showed how to induce or reduce grokking by arbitrary amounts not just x by just tuning one parameter adding less than one line of code to your torch module for instance and made the claim that grokking occurs when a neural network begins lazy which is a precise technical term that means it fits the training data without really learning good representations and eventually becomes rich another term with a precise definition that means it does learn taskrelevant representations <number> grokking is the point at which this happens and it can be induced by a variety of mechanisms including weight norm at initialization weight decay but crucially also several other parameters we introduce in our work whereas the omnigrok paper makes the claim grokking is fundamentally about weight norm and weight decay we show this is emphatically not the case and one can induce or ablate all past examples of grokking without even touching either weight norm or weight decay the reason for this is because there are other levers that control how much a network is lazy or rich in fact these notions of lazy vs rich and of grokking as the point where feature learning begins was concurrently made by two other excellent papers that also appeared at iclr alongside us <number> <number> funny enough as a reviewer for icml i got to see a truly disproportionate amount of low quality submissions about grokking and i think because it is was a puzzling empirical phenomenon it is somewhat of a nexus for quackery in my opinion grokking is less interesting now because we can control or ablate it arbitrarily and have been able to for a while before this grokfast paper came out as well as have theory explaining when and why it occurs another commenter also correctly makes the point that grokking is an academic curiosity because its an unexpected edge case behavior of a neural network you will never see the phenomenon in a production ml setting <number> grokking as the transition from lazy to rich training dynamics kumar et al iclr <number> <number> on lazy training in differentiable programming chizat bach <number> <number> dichotomy of early and late phase implicit biases can provably induce grokking lyu et al iclr <number> <number> grokking as a first order phase transition in two layer networks rubin et al iclr <number>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1aEhqZDUtNGNoWXdyTWhfcHJlbm5qSGNtb0JOR1hBWExCWUs3czBlWnAxaHVTcmMzZkx5WHZTSk51SUlQTGFMT3BWbFlXZnNCa2lwRnRITmxNS3lpdUE9PQ==

thanks for commenting i have a question about your paper you compare grokfast to nonmomentum sgd and then you discuss the theoretical differences with momentum and adam how does it differ in practice with momentum and adam both of them can be considered lowpass filters like grokfast im confused why this wasnt evaluated in your experimental results,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1dXJPRzE4QTRQVjJMV2hLYV8xR0xLUFBYMTNWVnhRdWZHS2t2YnhLT0ZOM0IzZGE3aEhkX01Zb0RCajlnMmFNenpyZHhfRlNMTl9MOTBRWnhDRjFUd2c9PQ==

the reason im hammering on this point is mostly because i work on ml compilers on the daily and directly do see the differences for strictly fp implementations its not particularly meaningful though you will see small differences in benchmarks but the difference in underlying implementation at the hardware architecture level becomes much more apparent with lower precisions eg bfloat and fp and it is noticeable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1cmFTMUhhWHVFcnpETDBjSmpRLUJQclY0NUNwcTBpM2ZnUGQxVkpvSGpCdTUtbHFNVmRDVXdPcktjT0E1ZUlMektxOW5FQTNUR0VzdTM0WWlMVmRWM2c9PQ==

sorry im not sure what you mean by you compare grokfast to we dont mention grokfast anywhere in our paper because our paper was written last year we didnt focus on optimizers in our paper the point was actually if anyone believed before that momentumadam were some magic special sauce that caused grokking for instance thilak et al <number> make this claim then the fact that we find grokking with vanilla gd refutes that claim since vanilla gd was the simplest setting in which one can find grokking thats what we sought to study in practice i dont think using those instead of gd would make a difference as evidenced by the fact that we show our claims hold in the settings of past work on grokking which all use adamw for instance see figure <number> of our paper which shows our results hold with adaptive optimizersin more realistic and larger settings outside of our toy model thanks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1UjJ0N3hfYlRxRzlhU3BMX0poVmJzU0xNSnQtN3JGN0ptVExfVDREMW1mUzI5bnYtdkhERkZBOGZIN2pDRV9FeHUyN1NhcHhNd2doZ1dyQlgyd0VhbWc9PQ==

check out neel nandas grokking paper the paper essentially shows via reverse engineering a one layer transformer trained to do modular addition that grokking refers to a model transitioning from a memorizing solution to a generalizing solution resulting in the sudden drop in test loss since memorizing solutions in the limited training set is in some sense an easier solution to learn than an actual modular addition algorithm the model first memorizes then since our model is trained with l regularization and memorized solutions have larger weight norms than a simpler generalizing solution the pressure to generalizes increases and increases over time until finally thousands of epochs in the model becomes good enough at generalizing that it can get rid of its memorizing components this clean up phase is the grokking we observe interestingly the grokking model is able to learn its generalizing circuit while maintaining training loss performance something that isnt really understood yet grokking only reliably occurs for models trained with regularization on algorithmic training sets where we only train the model on a limited percentage of data without regularization the model is never incentivized to form a generalizable ie lower weight norm algorithm with too much or too little training data the model will generalize from the very start or never grok respectively,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1czVlR0FkNTRPZmZlWlVyZW9EU1RxcWdVbm9CQ3dPV1NzTEZ0TmVwZktRWUtYcFFsSW0tY2lPR0VaeTVTUEl0OFFaRmxMR2NCS3h0a2RRV25wSGp3Ync9PQ==

> i suspect the models behind these two successes arent compatible enough to slap together yet and get a super human language using bot completely agree models are good at what you train them on if you train one on image classification youll get a model that is very good at image classification if you train one on natural language it will be good at language now it turns out that language is a good model for a lot of things but definitely not all open up a textbook for a random subject if its mostly text an llm might be okay at the subject taught by the textbook particularly if you add in some rag but if theres a lot of diagrams images formulae etc an llm will be pretty garbage at that subject if we want a true agi thats good at everything the only thing we can do is train it on everything and its basically impossible to make a dataset of everything the first model that everyone agrees is agi will probably be some frankenstein multimodal gnn trained with rl since thats the only way i can think of for a model to be able to handle everything while also being able to encounter everything during training or more likely itll be some type of entity that you and i cant even convince of at the moment,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1Z1BhZjdpaV84SFpjY3d3Zkk0RUNWblh0eWlfU0ZXYWtua045TXFGOFBFYWV1aUt5YmZicklGaU02NERXVk5UVndkU3ltZ3lPYTdXSmtHRjNUVEItNDFUZHctTUxjMDAtempJUWExelNEYnc9

the language is domain specific by design but the methods used to search in it would likely be useful in many other program synthesis tasks its worth noting that all ml methods including deep learning are special cases of program synthesis a given architecture defines a space of programs although the programs all have the same structure sgd searches it for one that fits data one of the advantages of representing your space of programs using a programming language is exactly that you can easily customize its inductive biases but a more general approach is to have a turing complete language and learn abstractions that suit a given domain as they do in dreamcoder,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZGhKSUpXUlo5SHg4VW5Zb3Vqa2NlaEtIdmFFZ291Qmlxa3ZmUlRVMV8xRGhaTURJaXNqc3YxaUk4bFFzYURQUF85NDUzNGFueGpEckxMNUhCbGZXM2c9PQ==

i am very confused about a description of kfold crossvalidation in datadriven science and engineering book from steven brunton and nathan kutz procedure for kfold crossvalidation of models the data is initially partitioned into a training set and test withhold set typically the withhold set is generated from a random sample of the overall data the training data is partitioned into kfolds whereby a random subselection of the training data is collected in order to build a regression model yj = f xj j importantly each model generates the loading parameters j after the kfold models are generated the best model y = f x is produced there are different ways to get the best model in some cases it may be appropriate to average the model parameters so that = averagej one could also simply pick the best parameters from the kfold set in either case the best model is then tested on the withheld data to evaluate its viability two questions <number> is it fair to say this is not an accurate description of kfold crossvalidation as it is typically understood <number> are there other understandings definitions of kfold crossvalidation for which this is accurate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2aFJwdGRad0NDTGVxRFJNaDR4T3YzUl9oRFRXa3BfbzNIRm5sTklURGpxSDh5VFhIS2RuS1ktNXNtOWZVX0J6X0EwUHU1SGsyOVZYSEsxWlBLaThMRkE9PQ==

well theres the question of whether grokking is happening all the time if youre training a llm there are tons of subtasks that it groks these individual pieces like learning a minor stylistic rule we dont even notice wouldnt have a large effect on the loss even when theyre grokked as well due to the amount of subtasks youd have a continual series of them being grokked which can look pretty smooth modular arithmetic then is just the case where theres basically only one task which is why it appears as a sharp shift or alternativelyin combination that in less strictly defined problems like language theres an easier ability to shift from one representation memorized to the generalized representation more smoothly while with modular arithmetic theres not enough space in between the two solutions to neatly transition much im pretty sure i read something that detailed the former hypothesis in more detail but i dont remember the paper or article,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VmItSVcwOU1zazJ1TFJkZ1N6ZDNJNjF6dTdUNGZES0lpc2MxWW81V1R5Q0NkLUpsNURXM2FyZXVOQ1VkM3pWTWR1WkJjRDNya2E2aW9fdS1UaG5IdlE9PQ==

im talking about the alpha scaling parameter we introduce in the output though its mathematically equivalent to tuning weight norm at initialization its easier to implement and easier to see the effect of in torch code this is just a scaling parameter replacing the output return output with return outputselfalpha for some constant selfalpha a large alpha encourages grokking its important to emphasize that grokking requires a number of factors to go right the three we discuss in our paper and doesnt occur in most settings in most data regimes architectures etc but when it theoretically can occur which is rare this alpha parameter can induce it brief intuition for what scaling network output does if selfalpha is large the network can fit the data with the weights barely moving so that the network at the end is well approximated by a firstorder taylor expansion around initial weights by definition this means the network is well approximated by some linear model in its parameters and this behavior of a network acting like its linearization is what lazy training is since the power of neural networks is when they are nonlinear in their parameters,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2eWhEbUlQV3FpX0lXTW9NZW51bVB4VWlkWGtUNEFfMGgtaHdsLVFiOXB0cndhV0tPOVItaXpZbnl5SnU2OWI2V2gwSFhkS0xTNkFfZ215Q1JZb1FZbGc9PQ==

from my experience llms usually do good with combining concepts but poorly with logic challenging programming is complex logic and common sense and applied math is a lot of combining concepts i find instruct llms very useful in suggesting ideas and general algorithmic frameworks but i always have to fix their mathematical understanding for example it would potentially argue that the data is iid on a rl setup without a replay buffer so my impression is that it still requires a lot of expertise but it has some good intuition similar to a talented student without enough eye for detail yet i would not expect it to come up with novel elegant algorithms though just novel combinations,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2S3ZoWHd3dktmVFRqUFI4RGVYaDJJbWVvT0tyOUJPUUtFQnRPMGNmU1BvS1hjcDk2eVZuQUNDdFRicDMxZ3doUGozMmxtLUptUEk2SGtuaE5mMUcyU19JLXNobTY0aFBOOWhUZWNKdnVpMFE9

not really let me explain you could smooth the loss by using sqrtpredictionlabel^<number>+eps where eps=e<number> this loss has a derivative everywhere but it should be intuitive that the problem is essentially as hard as before because the function did not really change this points out that the problem is not the lack of derivative but how smooth is the function more precisely the smoothness depends on the lipschitz constant of the derivative if the lipschitz constant of the derivative is infinite as for the absolute loss the function is hard to be optimized however if the lipschitz constant is not infinite but really big the function is still really hard even if it has gradients everywhere instead if the derivative has a small lipschitz constant it will be easy to optimize it in fact one can easily show that the convergence rate will go from slow to fast depending on the lipschitz constant,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VkNnckVaZ0VhY21NNW5YdlhyTnhDX2lWMGgzVE5rOU5PeFJpWHdhWjl5cFRXekoya3lGOTdaRnZuTGZnTnVicmRrRkpQWUZMS3dQVHY1TWF6NTFUclE9PQ==

i take a strong stance on the issue of class imbalance as im sure this will come up in some answers avoid the temptation of overunder sampling its voodoo science that causes more harms than good and may lead among other things to having to retrain the model over and over again the harm these approaches cause are perhaps better documented in the medical field which may explain why it unfortunately remains a popular approach in ml see understanding random resampling techniques for class imbalance correction and their consequences on calibration and discrimination of clinical risk prediction models sciencedirect<url> <number> the harm of class imbalance corrections for risk prediction models illustration and simulation using logistic regression arxivorg<url>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2c05RdFA1a181elloT0tEcXlfZ3lCRWM0Z0RBM2s2dVVwcGtNZnhKR2htRmdMNlFVcEFUOUctMGIxa0tlcWVzT0RFRUQ5Z3MzLTBDaHE0ZmFoOHFUcEE9PQ==

edit misread the question if it is just about large scale not about also needing accuracy at smaller scales discard this and go with normalisation and standardisation which will work perfectly for anyone interested in the case of data spread over different orders of magnitude like for example from e<number> to e i had this problem in my master thesis managed to solve it very practically by not imposing the loss ypred y^<number> but instead scaling it by the label magnitude ypred y eps + |y|^<number> roughly speaking this penalises relative error instead of absolute error and will give you good relative accuracy at all scales ymmv for more complex models did this with a simple mlp x hidden layers softplus activation eps is a small constant roughly speaking everything below eps will be penalised from a bayesian perspective this can be interpreted as specifying different observation noise scales saying that youre much more certain about the tiny labels than the huge ones in absolute terms which almost always is the case if your data is spread out like this normalising standardising will not work if your data spans <number> orders of magnitude the error at the smallest label will be about the same absolute size as the error for the largest label which for any practical model ie not completely overkill is way too high,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2al9FWEJUUVAtSUF6MFFKcUFBd1ZMUFI0RHJUelFnWVgxbEVXbWpfdE5CdDhvTkJNUUpKenZEdHJmTXltdFdfazJxUEpJMXhtSDFPQTdPYm14Y09TUVE9PQ==

are you certain your implementation is not flawed in any way i have spent just a couple of minutes looking at the code so apologies if i am misreading anything for example you do ask the user to input a key and say the key is not saved anywhere but it does seem that you store it in plaintext as an attribute on the capturestart module while the code is running is it possible for that to be captured by anything that can examine process memory in realtime does the fact the user is likely to give a short memorable key compromise the strength of the encryption at all edit is this your method of encryption if isinstancekey str key = keyencode encrypteddata = bytearray for i in rangelenimagedata encrypteddataappendimagedatai ^ keyi lenkey i am not endorisng chatgpts ability to do this accurately at all but just for fun i asked it to analyse your encryption method just the snippet given above it had the following to say about it potential issues security weak encryption xor encryption is considered very weak and is easily breakable especially if the key is reused as in this case it doesnt provide strong security for encrypting sensitive data key reuse if the key is shorter than the data it will repeat which makes the encryption susceptible to various cryptographic attacks like frequency analysis key management key distribution and storage the security of the xor operation relies entirely on the secrecy of the key if the key is compromised the data can be easily decrypted short key length if the key is too short eg a simple password it can be bruteforced or guessed easily data integrity xor encryption does not provide any integrity check an attacker could modify the encrypted data and without additional measures you wouldnt be able to detect such tampering chatgpt then makes some recommendations recommendations use stronger encryption algorithms consider using established and secure encryption algorithms such as aes advanced encryption standard libraries like cryptography in python provide secure implementations of these algorithms proper key management ensure that keys are generated stored and transmitted securely use key management services or libraries that support secure key handling add integrity checks implement cryptographic checksums or message authentication codes macs to ensure data integrity and authenticity it then goes on to give an example using aes from cryptographyhazmatprimitivesciphers import cipher algorithms modes from cryptographyhazmatbackends import defaultbackend import os ensure to install the cryptography library using pip install cryptography def encryptimagedataimagedata key generate a random initialization vector iv iv = osurandom<number> create a cipher object using the key and iv cipher = cipheralgorithmsaeskey modescfbiv backend=defaultbackend encryptor = cipherencryptor encrypt the image data encrypteddata = encryptorupdateimagedata + encryptorfinalize return iv + encrypteddata prepend the iv for decryption example usage ensure the key is <number> <number> or <number> bytes long aes key sizes key = osurandom<number> encryptedimage = encryptimagedataimagedata key this example uses aes in cfb mode which is a secure way to encrypt data it also includes an iv to ensure that the same plaintext encrypted multiple times will result in different ciphertexts,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2c2NyazdFMl9EWVg4X1M3cUdGRld4RUpxbW9OMGZPNXkza2Q0UjRjOXpfU0Vwa25SMnozUWZ3dktwVGRjQ183c2RzTTVlRUNuaFBYQXpXWENjM2U5bGc9PQ==

i have to disagree wholeheartedly and i think you are missing the main reason that you should choose between l or l as your cost function what do you want to estimate the optimal estimator for minimum l loss is the conditional median mediany | x the optimal estimator for minimum l loss is the conditional expectation ey | x what do you want your model to predict and how will that prediction be used for example if you are trying to train a model to estimate wait time and show it to your custom waiting on a taxi then maybe you prefer l because the median is more important to a users perception of wait accuracy however if you are trying to forecast some costs then you definitely do not want to use l because what you really care about is the averageexpected costs in the future not the median so you should use l >if you get <number> loss with one you get zero loss with the other this is not true this is only the case if mediany | x = ey | x and also vary | x = <number>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SEZ5LVFBMV9YU3ZGcTMteDFBcnVUWm1QaDR2c29Sel96RXBZRWdVdjdCLV9FVkZMZHQ0S3NDOTRpS1NKQmtiZFpidm1BN0FqT0NjakRQWnhCRFg3anc9PQ==

>ehh for most tasks you can treat it as a hyperparameter swap out ll and do whichever works better have to disagree with that i think you should choose l or l based on your problem and what you want to predict you will often find that you can achieve better l loss by optimizing l or you can achieve better l loss by optimizing l the optimal estimator for l is mediany | x but the optimal estimator for l is ey | x and so unless your distribution is symmetrical they will not have the same optimal model if you want your model to predict expected conditional y then choose l if you want it to predict the conditional median then choose l,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2c09kSDZPQmpwVmJSejJ1dXN3THNzZnFrTWoxS0ZTNzd3SW5FM0xZOXQxWVFGby1IX0JYblUxUWQtbC1xNDFNbXlBd290OGpsaXNjTjlLaUctYld4VkE9PQ==

this kind of stuff retrieval of actual weights instead of text according to recent context is a big part of the future there are two reasons both with a huge impact in lowering compute costs it allows a huge number of trainable parameters with a relatively small number of active ones during training and inference unlike rag it doesnt need excessively large token window to fit all potentially relevant documents i wonder how useful would be applying the same method to continuously fine tune on conversation history itself like some kind of agent remembering all its conversation history,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2WmVvT2FSTThzVU81VXpxRUNOR05EVWVicWFDVTktTTNBMm56S3N2eXNzV1pyZnM2MUEtZzhPQWQzWUh2NXBwMUZBRFhRU056NWtBX1hrc29kYkxlLUE9PQ==

i dont seem to understand how the late payment problem is a timeseries one im definitely missing something anyways i would say these are pretty weak features perform a thorough eda of the variables density plots can shed light on whether you can maybe split a variable or transform it eg if theres multimodality and some modalities seems to be associated with a label maybe create threshold variables or features through clustering also try some decomposition of the variables to look for seasonality and trends this can be used to create new features lastly some features may benefit from other transformations like low pass filters if the variable shows high frequency fluctuations or smoothing techniques like moving averages or savitzkygolay filters in any case once you do this you are not guaranteed to make it better but its definitely worth a try you would have to perform a thorough variable selection after this to remove variables that dont contribute towards the predictions this on top of the whole hyperparameter search,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MmloNDZlODhEa3lhakY5Tk1qbWVQeVBaLTJKSUl6MWJNeUFoYlJZZUZCaXZsVm9rVHVCNGdJNTc2NVEzd05EaS1LejlUUGhsMFNLXzBTM0pRNDRINENiME9VZHVRM1dyaXVLcmNvLWNNU1k9

yes they dont say lora specifically but its implied > our foundation models are finetuned for users everyday activities and can dynamically specialize themselves onthefly for the task at hand we utilize adapters small neural network modules that can be plugged into various layers of the pretrained model to finetune our models for specific tasks for our models we adapt the attention matrices the attention projection matrix and the fully connected layers in the pointwise feedforward networks for a suitable set of the decoding layers of the transformer architecture,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2bWIzQjY0S0pUSEZhVVJsRWJlNk5JbUFIRFo3cnJKVzUzdGVRa3RWbHhoS2tzSDhaMV82SWt2YktHYUhnZnNSaVhJTFV2b3Vlejl6RlZjVWhWbUVhQXc9PQ==
people often conflate grokking and generalization grokking is when networks are capable of generalizing but dont for a long time leading to the training loss being uninformative about the true state of the network while grokking as an english language word means to understand deeply in deep learning the phenomenon refers specifically to when training accuracy and test accuracy are decoupled and test accuracy stays low for a needlessly long time which is obviously undesirable further since grokking refers to a dynamical phenomenon that takes place during training separation of train and test loss curves and not a state of a network the phrase grokked llm is not well defined by grokked llm you seem to mean a language model that generalizes these are not the same thing thanks,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2R3RaVXp3ZGpzLVctRDVLRkN5OUF1RExmQlp1T29XUExwUTE1UjV2LUJtSmp6LWtpT2lRY0t1LWwwVDd4cUJmemJmMmhCZm1QZENoRWx3emJVZHF3MGc9PQ==

can you clarify what you mean when you say <number> steps for rpo rpo just seems like a slight variant of dpo that accounts for the magnitude of the reward differences dpo only tries to push down the rejected response and push up the chosen response so theres some loss of information there which rpo tries to mitigate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3R0t3VUZmZ3o2eC1ENlBXcmMxekE5T3hyckRiNnI0Y2pxMG01d0t5VzdTN3hyekdDR1A1SFNYc05yaENrNlJlaVFQQmRYdmpJWXdVWHlvZUdiNWY3cXI4UkVLV0dtT3p2ZWNhaXRMeWoteDA9

hes an llm hype boy his story details dont match between youtube and reddit and technical details are suspicious for some reason he formatted all the messages with html tags however the service he used for finetuning accepts data in jsonl file his case would require data uploaded as jsonl rows following chat completions api schema which of course doesnt need html tags included,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3ZWF2eEllVFNGaG0tekhJMDZyN0djQkpmcmdHMmlXSElOcDZYMk9yMEU3em1wX0cyQXdiOC1QN3E3aEhxaEd0RURsMkdOUEZxNWx5REp4QnQwLUdyN1pRYUtScUd3X2FxTy1WdUQtcTRYZkE9
llms do make a lot of things easier but honestly using smaller non llm models can be just as correct biggest deterrent to using llm can be cost and also latency cause some llms can be very slow if there is a lot of input to go over so a more traditional smaller model trained on features might still be preferable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3X1FwT292TW5MNWR1RVNKdTBvT1lvVVFxRnNhUU5DeHJrUUxXdHdVUDNzWjVUOXFZQUZhQUJoNEJua2pZSHFNSnY5akItZG5FeF9RUDk4SU9LLWloLXhrZnpYZ1VUQkNVXzJyTjlLSk5DbTQ9

sorry i am both not trusting their technical report and not finding it impressive at the same time first they didnt compare to llama second i dont trust the way they conduct experiments on pr reports lastly i dont care about their tech as long as they dont publish papers similarity to openai apple is even worst its probably not so difficult to do what they did if you are apple and they probably mostly integrated existing technology now marketing it as their ideas because there is no fing paper regarding how feasible it is well there is a lot of engineering for powe consumption etc but i would say that on the basic form it is utterly trivial if you root your device you can do it yourself just slower and takes more battery for example the way they described adapters implies its innovative although they said utilize to not claim its their idea however they do imply it is not an idea everyone who does nlp uses personally i have used it as well for similar tasks overall i didnt like the report at all a win for the marketing team though its also an interesting experiment at scale but the results will never be shared since they share nothing,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3QUIwSVp6aUhLR3NHekN6QWtpcWhoSnBGaE9rdDdhOXJuRUdma2tnMXcyV096YXUzeFFZRmxJbFhrSnFyZXpUYnVFUTVZbFJTR2J5UExsTFREZXVqaXVhakZwdGNtQVZHRWk2MkhaY0pjV0U9

if efficiency or ease of hyperparameter tuning is the goal i would try to demonstrate that in a regime where you care about those things cifarmnist are so small that you sorta dont care how long training takes because anything reasonable will work in a reasonable time frame imagenet is big enough where you have to be judicious if you dont have unlimited time and money so that would be the scale that your target audience would care about efficiency of an optimizer or how easy it is to find a good enough hp setting also most of the expense for imagenet is due to the resolution you can train on lower resolution for far cheaper and still get pretty good results as long as you arent expecting to match giant models pretrained on a billion images check out progressive resizing fastaijeremy howard has a nice blog post on it i think also there have been at least a couple large comparisons of optimizers on cifar scale problems and they largely find that no optimizer dominates and that even plain sgd works fine if you tune it well leslie smith has some good papers on quickly finding good but not perfect hyperparameters that are great if you want to avoid a hyperparameter search,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aGowRUZWUHkwbmo5X01VVVJFaHVpZ015ODFKZm1reWZVU2NHM1JTdHZkcTd2RXlxOWVRak16eHJTVllzMVUxUzJ0aUtmLWVYN2l6WWEyM09KZjRkYkE9PQ==
my rule of thumb about llms is that they are only appropriate to use when you already know what the answer should be but you want help iterating on it so theyre good for things like editing documents writing boilerplate code or information retrieval when you have access to the original sources you shouldnt use them if youre not willing to double check their work though like you should never look up information with an llm and then just trust that its right you need to look at the original source to verify it or you should never let it write code and then just deploy the code without checking the code first this is different from normal deep learning in the sense that its very hard to measure the reliability of an llms typical output which is why checking it is necessary with normal deep learning by contrast you usually have clear quantitative metrics that will let you know how often the model is right and under what circumstances it makes mistakes this allows you to understand when and where it can be used without much human supervision,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SnlTaF9aOGFKSmliZjQ5c1NfbXc1SlhKekFJUV9xaHZidkF5OUtka0VhMnlVanppU3VsdDlVN0t1VTNBTlQyc2k3czZCN09DV1lwcFQ0NVNTdGpPaUE9PQ==

for training or experimenting with models we sometimes use stuff like hugging face detectron ultralytics etc but for actual production use cases we export the trained model into a more portable format like torchscript tflite onnx etc then wrap it into the rest of the production code in c++ java kotlin etc for production level efficiency and performance though keep in mind many researchers or industry data scientists will heavily modify their training libraries ive personally rewritten big chunks of detectron while training a model because i needed capabilities not in there also certain parts of the library are somewhat inefficient,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bHEyOFVya2RyLTFGb1BzekxtNHdEVWdZZmFObVpRZjNVamZQQVIyVG5zQ1c4QUc4dVZqaHkyM3lqSDRBQVdVNUlVZFFXYy14U0EtQzRISVkzWEtkS3c9PQ==
the real problem is not that mnist and cifar are not representative of real workloads that is certainly an issue but i think the larger concern would be whether you have done a lot of workloadspecific hyperparameter tuning either explicitly or implicitly that will overstate the performance of your method relative to your baselines and that in general you might not have had the resources to build the strongest possible baselines if you are studying neural network training algorithms consider implementing your method to comply with the algoperf benchmark rules<url> that limit workloadspecific tuning either tuning ruleset you can see the rationale for the rules here<url> along with other suggestions on comparing training algorithms from the mlcommons algorithms working group<url> i cochair the working group currently and we are working on developing a process where people can present evidence that they have something interesting to evaluate and then the working group can do the somewhat expensive scoring process to add it to a leaderboard anyone interested is welcome to join,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3cm81RmN4SVp1Y0hoT1g2YTVEaHhuNnhFVHBrTUxXSzBYY0gwWTg4WlJkWmt3X1BiaWRXY2dXZHJCMk5IZkNjQ3NtQkpkbXFJbkdxUGEtSUwzc0xwbUE9PQ==

conda works quite well for me but i have to strictly follow two rules always use the libmamba solver or use a mambaenabled installation and always use envyml to update environments it manages system level dependencies quite well and can keep separate versions for different environments you just have to include the right package in your env list so that it does not fall back to the system default version the problem that used to trip me up all the time was matching nvcc and gcc versions which is quite painful to solve on the system level i hate fiddling with alternatives but if you include the nvcc complete package and the cxx complier or build tools package it automatically matches the versions for you,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3dWZCSlgzLUNoTEt0TVhMMm1FSnNEWUV4NURuTjdrNWlPejd2cW5mcDk3TUFkdmpuY2hxMHJTNldrWkE2VHBSZmRNcFpBcGoxNjBDdWRrSDlJcXJPc0E9PQ==

unfortunately while a fun dataset to play with tinyshakespeare is just too simple of a dataset to really draw conclusions from going up to something like tinystories would likely show completely different learning dynamics you could then move on to tinybooks and then finewebedu those datasets would each be a significant step up in difficulty for language modeling and would expose whether or not your modified mlp scales with complexity it could be that tinyshakespeare is so simple that the network can encode everything it needs in the embeddings and the qkv weights of the transformer so the mlp mostly just operates as a passthrough to figure that out try one more ablation test where you remove the mlp or replace it with just the activation function that would give you a better idea as to whats going on before attempting to scale up to more challenging and interesting datasets,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UHo3dmVUeFQzX19qNEQ0Zi12VTlMN3lydEV3Q1VoeU1DWVJrZWd1X0N6dURLMGNKSEt5eDVLWXduWWx3Qzl1YXRzTUl6Z1cza0QxakRwaFNaMDNzZkE9PQ==

hi i came a bit late after <number> years lol niche conferences could be highly visible and hold high credentials for example log is a wellknown conference for graphbased deep learning as you can see the members of the advisory board are big names in the field eg bronstein kipf leskovec etc as well as the reviewers people doing applied research in gnns in the industry are well aware of this conference kumoai deepmind etc big conferences can have noisy reviews for example <number> of the papers accepted by the first committee were rejected by the second in neurips <number> <url> if you are interested in a specific field i think its a good idea to publish in a smaller community where you can get more valuable feedback due to the narrowness of the field furthermore i think it doesnt stop your paper from being visible if its of high quality for example this logs paper <url> is cited by accepted papers in journals like nature jmlr and other prestigious conferences like iclr and neurips another example is the automl conference if you work in that field you might know about frank hutter so yes such small conferences are pretty prestigious in my opinion and its not easier to get published in these conferences as well given the quality of the members,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MUNlYjZjUzRWMmtoX2FnWFlUdXdFMTF2REE2cUxWekxnQ1V2SThuZ3JaMHN6WndQVi1XSk1nUVcxLW5KNDJhYXc1Z1BnU0l2dkh2M3dybjc5cmYwU1UtOUFxUnNaZm56d05HeFd5Tm8taXM9

my recommendations of what ive seen work well come prepared with two things <number> quick <number> second about me that youve practiced in a mirror and can deliver without it sounding rehearsed <number> a story of what youve been working on and why its important to you and others those will come in handy but when you actually go to initially connect just be human and interested in them ask them how they got into whatever they are doing what they like to do for fun if you make human connections it makes the business connections easier and stickier you want those prepared for the moment they ask you about yourself or when its natural to share your story in the conversation because its relevant,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Z3lLWjJVRlFpdi1qeGVNTFp3cUJRNHlRa201b29kNDhfdFpIa0N2VDAtekJCaVJRRDgtaUR3Mll1X01FX19FaTBoTVlvS2VxaXdaVkJvNDFpNWJuT1E9PQ==

correct me if im wrong from what i have gathered form the comments is that what we really need to be doings it essentially taking apart something like gpt<number> and figuring out how it is working this does not mean doing input output testing what it means is as some have said freezing parts of the model or removing them and seeing what happens when you give it an input this in essences would be like lobotomizing the ai in selective areas trying to figure out what does what lmao and dont get me wrong i understand this would take a lot of time but you would over time be able to create a representation of what does what in the model and make changes if that makes sense,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RlZRc1JhY1lrSmhhdVp1NHpILVdkSXc3MGhnclp6aExKQklrZkhaNVhhd3d0aTZmTVBqS1NpMDlsRGxvQUZJUmp0WERxRU9DWGJqd2tqNm5kcTdSalE9PQ==

bear in mind that most other people you encounter at a conference are there to network too of course people will have certain types of people theyd prefer to network with depending on their goals but you can quite quickly suss this out dont gum up too much of someones time but equally make excuses and move on if someone is doing it to you definitely have your storyelevator pitch down pat so people will quickly be able to figure out if they want to talk more with you as much as it might suck for someone to be disinterested theyll be doing you a favor as you can move on to someone who might be try not to take peoples disinterest personally there will hopefully be more than enough people for you to find those you do click with oh and at socials its totally fine to walk up to a small group and listen in and potentially get involved especially if they leave a gap for people to do this if people are having a private discussion it will be obvious or they shouldnt be doing it in the middle of a mixer anyway,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3eEpPV2dHX3R0VHA1QkozdlNaN3M2QTRVOVRRRmV2d29vUXJuTmoyTWlBemRxMG1IUXF0RGU3X2hfV19GaG40dmh5UWY3TTZoNm50WlRvdUNwRGpTT0E9PQ==
just talk to people talk about the talks youve seen and what was interesting about them talk about what the other person is working on talk about the weather and when the opportunity arises bring up whatever it is youre doing dont force the issue everyone isnt there for your benefit but someone is probably as interested in your topic as you are in theirs thats the person thats going to be a valuable contact the point is to put yourself out there so that brownian motion can do its job,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3N0lxaXluVTc0UlcwSkY2OFphY1hrVmM4UFMwVi1BUFFwTlpVdW1DMG1ObkU2aExFT2JQSVVWR3lrSjRtSmQ2cVRMSXFBRmVjU3FfVlNISXBRSlI5OVE9PQ==

honestly the best approach to conferences is go wanting to learn and be very curious like youre saying that will lead to conversations valuable for both sides and providing value is probably the best way to network anyways no one is probably going to call you just because you said you worked on a project that did xyz but theyll be much more likely to call you because you asked poignant questions about their research which demonstrated your ability to meaningfully contribute big asterisk this is my take as someone who is more on software architectureinfrastructure side not research or ml directly but conferences have done amazing things for my career and this approach had huge impact even thought that wasnt my goal,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YkN1WXR5aVZjVDRlOENEX0RuRDItRTk1a2dKdVowM2VubmxzWUhKSDl2NTA2ME95aU94c3pXSGlXdVJyZ09nb3NzVWR2MDFIeVF1LW5ianc2WjBHdkE9PQ==

firstly do not use deep learning unless you have to besides what problem just enables you to go from nondl to dl to transformer certainly not anything with tabular data for images you use cnns or maaaaybe vit if you have tons of data and transformers for text you just start with them for time series this could be possible but statistical models or gradient boosting are still the best in vast majority of cases but in general remove features instead of adding them either with automated feature selection or manually use better hyperparameter tuning eg tpe in optuna instead of grid search validate more metrics in general optimize the workflow use proper scheduling tools optimize sql queries parallelize preprocessing set up data model versioning add model monitoring regular retraining etc,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3WDBZckpoVzd5R2Flam5PV01jdm9Zck5PcTZrdlNHVWI0WkE1SjNtbnNyWUVBd1Q1NUdkM3dkSVAzamctY2JDbGpwZ2dMQjhUbWVjVEp6V0ZtcWFwMWc9PQ==

ill be honest and this may sound harsh but this feels like you have a fixed toolset and once youre done with those you are unsure what to do this could just be you skipping over the detail or in the worst case scenario that sounds like a script kiddie who doesnt go below the surface nit saying this is you but it sounds like the way you described it it is all about the data the data is more important than the model forget the features the real focus needs to be on understanding the data it is absolutely fine to have tasks in your team to continuously improve this understanding imho it is more important than just model selection and implementing features,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Z2ZNTXZVUEFOZHpCVHYyU19IbXNfdkJHZ2hBUTNPalhUdExRNEJkYnNWblpEeWRUTXJnSWs2YVU0cGd1MGhWaDhJemVDcHI2Ul83U2NWNUMyNTNpaEE9PQ==

mostly data tbh i read like a dozen papers a year i can integrate directly into models i maintain usually some of them can provide small boosts and a very rare few will significantly shift results the latter usually also require significantly more work than the former and may discourage people from exploring them which is unfortunate the most immediate thing you can do with to improve results is improving the data you have both the quantity and quality beyond that pin down the key parts of your model and make sure to keep up on relevant paper,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MkZfQ3EzQ0Y0UXFNd1NLWE00aHJpbW1LM0dXX3hXT2I3cE93cGQxNGJlUUJrdEVENk5NR2VDeWhKSHNOUU0yaTNmSERCZTJab3RHQ0xmSG5MVWl2Z2c9PQ==

it depends on what the waveforms contain our ears are more or less insensitive to phase information so if you are processing an audio signal meant to be heard then the relevant content isencoded in the frequency spectrum magnitude changes over time so preprocessing with stft makes the input easier learn from and also more analogous to how it is received by the brain if what you are processing is any other kind of signal telecom radar sonar radio telescopes ecgekg then this type of preprocessing could be completely inappropriate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Wm1uaWF5bWRFRHBIWnR3VVRJSXRKcHBYTG9VcDdOX3BieEZOOXR3VHN6S2x4VFZRajJFZzFQejZIVVRUbjZnb29vclozanVOUUZCODd6d2dLV1YyaWc9PQ==

to me this paper says the quiet part out loud in that mainstream ml venues systemically reject applicationoriented ml papers even if they have several novel contributions instead preferring theory and experiments on synthetic benchmarks while im a strong proponent of the value of theory i think a good mix with empirical results ie on realworld data on metrics used in practice is necessary as well for people outside the theoretical community to care more about these venues,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bmoyWEpsWmQtZkZOX1V5Q1NOOGFZRFphX1NadHV2ZUtuODk4ZGFtR0N2ZlZtSkZDREFUbWlNQzZ2VTduNFQxYjN2SXNxSDRLQUFJVzlONThRMGRlZXc9PQ==

this is pretty much what mlops engineers take care of for a living youll want to have a separate qa test set that you can trust and run regular tests using your model i dont know your exact situation but im assuming youre running your model on a regular basis on newly collected data sinc distribution shift is a real concern i would first train the model regularly too and run inference on the qa set that you have if the performance degrades to an unacceptable point then use the previous model if not then replace the model its a very typical developmentproduction setting on software development,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bDlfRk5lQmlYMGZYZ2VFZnlHNFBGaTVnS29xNTE2ZFJfMmdET2hURGF6X1lmcnVETkNPWXRNM19fYzduckZJckViYlhGQWxvR1AwamZLNnpqdFJ4N3c9PQ==

the trick you used is known from other literature eg for obtaining bounds on the log normalisation constant the problem is that in principle you can get the mean under control but the variance of your loss estimator can become unpractically large so that learning rates must be very very small to not get affected by rare extreme outliers eg lets assume the typical case where you have <number> of samples loss is ~<number> and the rare <number> of the cases has loss <number> and t=<number> then the average over the exponentials is ~<number> and the variance is ~k the optimal v will be ~log<number> which scales the variance down to ~k<number><number>~=<number> or a signal to noise ratio of <number> for comparison the standard sample average would have mean ~<number> variance ~<number> or a signal to noise ratio of ~<number>,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3T2V0al9MR3h6UWszQVNULWNPQUxqNnQ4WEV0LW1vaWFaTDFUVEFKWnNfWlhsWkVtLTVHR2FRM0s0b05ObXhIMHktN3JvYmJGMEtJd2tXT2J3SzFVVnc9PQ==

yes in this domain specifically you tend to create different crossvalidation evaluation pipelines in cancer research you typically want to predict the response of tumors characterized by a tensor of gene expression values to drugs characterized by their molecular graphs or vectors derived from them you can then get your folds in function of the drugs and get one cv pipeline in function of the tumors and get another then furthermore if you are trying to predict response to specific conversations you can evaluate on the highest concentrations for some drugs checking the extrapolation capabilities of the model and also doing the same with intermediate concentrations also interpolation works finally if you want to predict synergies you can also evaluate on totally unseen drugs or on unseen pairs where other pairs for a drug is seen and to close the message it got longer than expected you can create the folds in a way that is even more challenging and realistic splitting your data over cancer types or drug families this way you can get estimates of your model on different ood settings that can reflect what you intend to do with that model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4QU84cDRMamIwR1RRdWw1Nk9ZZkZ3NEZ2VE5ZWDBzZXhHalV1NFd2QUFod2kyaHU1d2xITGM3Z0ZDUmQza1hkVWJCNWtkTE5LSHdJVWI3SVhOWVZLbmc9PQ==

depends on which part of the pipeline for model training we mostly train using onprem linux boxes no real orchestration on those since we find most of the orchestration tools kind of get in the way for model training then for actual running of models in production we basically use c++ code for model runners in a kubernetes environment weve tried mlflow and found it kind of gets in the way and a lot of the computer vision model training libraries dont really work with mlflow properly for stuff like multinode training without major rewrites though keep in mind when were doing model training were trying to scrape every last bit of performance from that machine the way i work i will personally strip everything off the machine that even hampers performance by adding even <number><number> to overhead,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4NDlNRFYycUVHOG9kMzZTY0djOFk0RjVrNk5jc2NZb2FFTVI3UU05c0pSR3lrRVVJQ1ZfQjN6RF82cVNEYnpQenBGbV9YQ3BIOWZGR2FGVTdGYXBsWGc9PQ==

theres a sycl programming model that works on multiple hardware stacks including intel the programming model is decent maybe somewhat similar to cuda in the whole grid block warp idea but it works with modern c++ features like lambda functions and references instead of very rawpointerchasing c focused cuda offers a slightly different memory management model too intel has been pushing it heavily with their oneapi now for the sad part it hasnt taken off i hear people in academia who have access to heterogeneous clusters and dont want vendor lockin in talk about it but in commercial world no takers despite it being around for a while  at one point of time i was entertaining the idea of learning sycl instead of cuda so that i could work with more modern features of cpp and possibly use multiple gpu models but later i realised cuda is just way too dominant and in a sense market is rewarding nvidia for thinking almost <number> years ahead the professor who worked on early cuda was hired away from academia by nvidia in <number> george hotz of tinygrad has done a decent dissection of this problem chip making companies took the wrong approach to the problem they shouldve got from designing good software stack to hardware,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4YkJQd1YwWmhYaG96anRUbHd4WmRSNUZ5SnRId2pOVkdFdm5ycEFtb3VNN1drS2FzNjlDZEh1MDNBZ0stSzk1eW5IZ1lXQjIyRlNqWDA3cEdialpzbGc9PQ==

a lot of medical studies involving ml have been called into question due to some problems data leakage no traintest split i dont have a reference at hand but we had a talk in our company from a leading researcher whos group is dedicated to double checking that stuff one of the examples was a study who claimed to have developed an ai model that could find cancer with the same accuracy as the radiologists well they found that some the images used had like a stamp that radiologists would put in case they suspected cancer and that was what the model was focusing on,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4b2REV19sTlB5cTBkbDRnYWZiM2Z1YzJ1aFNXMVZtbDA2TFhkM2x1MGR2NXdtTnZiOWlRZ2RxcGlNcW1GN2RnSXp5VlBaZXA1ZEk0VjdzaDR5b3hsNDczY2dWNmQ2Tkx4cjBKa0dwUHRYQ0E9
also kind of related for multiinstance learning like this proteins and molecules cells and molecules but more generally applies to recommender systems when you test ood we found out that it makes sense to decompose the predictions you subtract from your test set the mean for each for example drug and you recompute the metrics what we do in reality is we fit a ridge regressor using as predictors the ids of the drugs and proteins and we compute the metrics on the residuals then you recompute your metrics r for example for each of your drugs andor proteins this way you can estimate not only how good your predictions are in general but how well they predict specific interactions in the recommender system setting its likely that you have apparently nice predictions for ood samples but then most of the r comes from good predictions of a large but not interesting interelement variant in the drug target interaction for example you test your model on ood proteins get a nice metric you think that your model is great but when you do this descomposition its close to <number> it turns out you have a protein kinase in your test set that interacts with <number> metabolites and a metabolical dehydrogenase that interacts only with <number> your model predicts ood a <number> probability of the kinase interacting with everything and a <number> for the dehydrogenase your model is not useful at all but your metric even ood looks great,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4ekRXaWNaVmlnTVNFTnJyU2FvVzhwUzBnb3V2YnBOcEpjU0I3akFzVGkzcHhKN3Q1NGRIRmFGTFB3RFRlRVA2Y1NSVTdsaFNRbk1ZWE5hbmtSZXBQT0E9PQ==

the notebook i had posted elsewhere in this thread as some brief notes on this but long story short gradcam reasons about a linear gradient approximation of your model not your model itself it doesnt actually give you answers to specific what if questions in any apparent way the real issue is universal approximation imo if you end your network with a mlp classification head youve already committed to an uninterpretable model design if you want your model interpretable according to some specific logic it actually has to work that specific way and not other ways gmpcam does this in a way gradcam does not,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4VUFSNWM0M1BhdW10cXBCRHdQcTFTdmlnWFM0V2o0V1diWkdzcnoyM2VCVnpaTWt2TFNpblJabUZ2MWlfNmZmWEpRSEYyS3pLbW9McS1BLTlBZ1FxNnc9PQ==

thanks i would just comment that sometimes it is necessary to first work on the simplest version and let others improve it you can say hey we can actually use the gradient to generate and explanation and then let someone smarter smarter == already knows your idea to fix it therefore i would argue it is an excellent idea edit by the way i am also skeptical of xai in general but i am <number> certain it is a useful tool it does help to evaluate and debug the model which is good i believe that even unfaithful explanations can be useful if it can help you to detect bad bugs metrics are terrible imho although i mostly use only that in this case we always use some form of average which is also linear why is it bad well because we take a set of scores make it a scalar and call it a day you can also do it peicewise and we usually do but it still tells us very little i can go on and on why making a classification <number> or <number> good or bad is also not faithful but you probably thought about it since you know about xai methods i will take a look at your notebook,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4dVNuVmRxT1dDYU1CWm8xYVJVMVpqZWxuRHh2c3RremVjX1FiWVlZb3BMTV9QNWtyTGQ2X2tIOTk0OWdfeWZGQktDVHExNHBjOW1nZy10aXByVjFVNjAtanozNU5JaTlZMG1fMkJ0aVV6bE09

in my workplace i find that actually adding features add more performance to the model than hyperparameter tuning etc were at the point where our data is in the billions and petabytes level with a streaming model improving the model architecture with more sota architectute no longer increase the performance of the model our analysis is usually what features can increase the gmvaovopmsgpms and what label we can use from user implicit feedback to add another prediction head to increase these online metrics directly,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4RnZ3dGhaY1l5VUNxdVVKdzc5ZzZMR3dtRExUQlVtZktBc3ZtVG5SU0tUZFFNWkt0UjBUUEpBbnFjenJmWmI5RGExOFBfemx0a0gyMFQtSHBHdThJMFE9PQ==

if the type of censoring is unrelated to the type of creativity then its an issue for example if the prompt is write a clean joke about xxxx and it performs worse after censoring then thats an unintended consequence from the article >the base model generates a wide range of nationalities with american british and german being the top three in contrast the aligned model only generates three nationalities american highest percentage chinese and a small percentage of mexican and >the base models age distribution resembles a normal distribution spanning from below <number> years old to nearly <number> years old with the majority centered around <number> the aligned model however selects ages within a narrow range with a strong preference for age <number> and a few other ages between <number> and <number> notably the aligned model does not select any ages above <number> or below <number> indicating a limited capability in generating diverse age values how is that outcome totally obvious,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MFFiTTRFdlNXSy1LRzdxZGw5aS1zYjNhdHdTVFpDdDNUMlZaeDZpSTJITTNsOVRyT3ItYnhfMzB3QjVnLWxlenNVLXV2ZlBOSkU2SUFtNVlVc190NTB1eTFRNHRJazVIZGN5enAwQlJ6N3c9
it really depends on what you meant by sota in the token dropping school where attention sink was initially proposed lminfinite<url> is a concurrent work to streamingllm your first paper with pretty much the same idea infllm<url> is a direct followup to stream which keeps the initial tokens attention sinks recent tokens and basically does rag on the middle kv cache adaptively if we step outside token dropping and only care about general kv cache compression keeping full precision initial tokens which is the spirit of attention sinks has quite some tractions in the quantization school of kv cache compression where many recent methods like kvquant<url> intactkv<url> and skvq<url> have employed this strategy shameless plug our bit kv cache quantization method kivi<url> which was recently accepted to icml and is getting adopted to huggingface transformers<url> does not keep initial but recent tokens in full precision but it is also plenty performant paper<url> pr post<url> code<url> are those methods sota it is up to what you are trying to do and what your resource constraints are as such lossy compressions can have very different properties when evaluated against different tasksupon different backbone models we recently benchmarked quite some kv cache compression methods which we will arxiv open source soon and found that proper quantization usually gives you wellaround performance retention where tokendropping approaches can take much more aggressive compression on some specific types of tasks that they are good at and their kv cache footprint can theoretically be constant which is a huge plus over quantization pretty intuitive finding imho as if one evicts the taskdependent tokens then the performance is usually doomed so the eviction strategy needs to be onpoint which can happen in some but usually not all tasks whereas if one quantizes everything then all things are a bit worse but at least all tokens are still contributing to whatever tasks asked a bit extra than you asked but hope it helps,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4cG1PYzRtQ3FnY3BvdW1vVEUwMGpteUpodndxZEJrTFRlX2lQNXMyRUlOU18taXRWb21mMFZYWTk0XzQ3RDh4Mk9HbjVGRmN5LV9UTFdUNFZoSEpGN2c9PQ==

long generation is indeed a less utilized capability with fewer rational use cases code refactoring fiction writing etc but methods like stream can also help with long input short answer type of tasks that are prevalent and useful summarization factual qa etc you might have gotten thrown off by the infinite sequence length claim made in the stream i think the authors are more trying to claim their memory footprint does not grow with the sequence length and can therefore support infinite context but not saying it is only useful for nonstop generation which is indeed useless as you suggested this wording is unfortunately kind of vague so i thought id help clarify a bit,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4UEF1WURILXlBOFY5dE43VV9ROExDSVpZeHd2YWRsMVVtS3E3dnBwOWRnbXg5M0JTR1NrZktPelZIby03cFppREhPbWdXcWJ1UEJ3R2hoa3FGdWg1RkE9PQ==

first i am very sorry for your loss having to go through a masters degree and a phd in that situation must have been really hard i am a junior ml engineer in a big company and i had the chance to speak to some higher up managersvps and they told me that to be a manager isnt to know more than the people in your team but to know how to utilise their knowledge as much as possible to put the right people in the right positions having such a background is good enough for you to supervise them properly and let me tell you that most of the managers in my company are nontechnical or have a completely different background the managers also while getting promoted go to different teams that work with completely different things your responsibility is to align the needs of the company your responsibilities the resources given to you and to manage the people accordingly,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4R1RLcTVpRnZURnhuZVU5MHZqOG83cjFKbTVidk5xbFNFZjNOWl95dFE1QWw1M0pOaEswSm1HSTVaWXh1Q2ZwRzQ3VEFHcVlHbGlxVnZzSGFvX3Z2S0JyeVJQbUpMRkcteEtBNVltQTJGdzA9

ive been in a similar situation where ive experienced analysis paralysis due to the overwhelming amount of information available its easy to feel lost with too many options and not knowing where to go my advice would be to take some time off from work and other responsibilities and instead focus on listening to podcasts that you genuinely enjoy this can help calm your mind and refocus your attention on whats truly important many people today struggle with artificial adhd which is often caused by the constant juggling of multiple tasks and ideas by taking a break and listening to podcasts you can give your brain a chance to relax and refocus ive found that this approach has worked for me and i hope it can help you too its a simple yet effective way to clear your mind and gain clarity on what you want to learn or achieve eventually youll likely feel the urge to learn something new or work on a project that sparks your curiosity this atleast worked for me i really wanted to help you in any means with my limited wisdom hope it help take care,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aHdkWmZYNDdscm9HaHBvM1BYem56eUo0aGtlTFdlWmM4bmFfSldQd1QwOHpQNUhpdG15cW5rMV85NVkyOVBjenhsa3FMeUN3Vm44UC1VU3U4ZjFralE9PQ==

i dont have anything to contribute to solve the issue but the topic reminds me of this paper <url> ive implemented this and although its kinda nice it obviously depends on another hyperparameter akin to a learning rate so yeah hahaha anyways i never had the exact same issue but i agree with others that it might be a mix of rules of thumb and a bit of handwaving hocuspocus trial and error kind of thing usually you already know how the curve should look so you let it run for a while and plot how things are going theres also some helpers used in bigger models like a visualisation on the models output eg images or text the model generates or some results on a small test set you can just take a look and say ah its still sht and let it run for a few more epochs because then you have that along with the training metrics to elaborate a better guess on its learning versus i trained a giant random number generator does it work every time nay absolutely not but at least for me that usually helps a bunch,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4UGswRk8xcnpvRHp3QzRpYnZudmdaZml3eXlxVTBmcF90bmdIcWJfTUpyZzNMVWxuQ1NnRUY5WE5Kb0FKVUFzX2F5VFhvSDFMU0xsS05fb3RGVHZxb3c9PQ==

reading academic papers is a skill set that only comes with a lot of practice humans can barely do it well theres no hope for an llm like sure you might be able to get the llm to give short summaries derived from the bare text of the paper but can you get the llm to say things like >the authors claim that their method beats the state of the art but their comparisons are untrustworthy because they didnt optimize the alternative algorithms for their problem their dataset is weird they didnt do any kind of cross validation and they forgot to include several of the leading methods for solving the problem no you almost certainly cannot edit what about stuff like this > theres a bunch of math in the paper and it seems to be correct but its mostly irrelevant to the thesis of their work and you shouldnt spend too much time on it thats what id really want to hear and theres no way im getting that from an llm,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4c3R0Tm1CZ3pJOFIxSnpmRTlmbW03ZVhaN3FRS1J3aFJoMGpzRklxaWQ5aERQZVRQY1lJMUNGakt4THpGR29EYVlqd1JaajczMmUxcWwyOVNKS1k1UkE9PQ==

because you are not there to lead them you are not a general leading soldiers you are technical manager supporting the science team to achieve business goals the role of a manager is to meet clients gather business requirements organize priorities and tasks communicate with other teams etc in particular this is why a technical team lead and manager are often two different people especially at large companies however a team of good scientists can work without strict technical supervision but would get extremely boggled down with necessary administrative tasks without a manager,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4dmFCOHItcnpCRVJQSE82ZDNFS3k2RHBwd29ib0t1alk2UmlhZmp1eXVuV3N2bXE4WGZYNkstU0JKc0Rjakw2ZW1MeGEtVC1rendybXVRNzUydDRER0E9PQ==

your concern is a sign you actually care which means you are more qualified than most people in management the other factor to keep in mind is that a principle scientist should be the one to help with working out technical problems and hurdles the ideal setup would be that you are the manager who focuses on helping your team deliver results aligned with businessorg priorities and you are developing people on the team ideally in ways they want to be developed then you are partnered with a technical leader often a principle fellow or distinguished scientistsometimes a lead or staff depending on the company and org structure they are responsible for brining a greater level of technical knowledge and problem domain depth to help the team over technical hurdles this doesnt mean you are not technicalwhich you clearly arebut that you have a broader technical background and have a better understanding of the overall vision and direction of the org the technical lead is more focused on how to get something done you become responsible for making sure that it does get done and it is what the stakeholders are expecting in the end if you are passionate about growing people i would say go for it it can be a tremendously rewarding job if you enjoy it and are in an org that encourages it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WFNPTnBpNnk1S05JSHo0TWlnZ2YzbE5Ga1BfMW9YcHk5RWFJOHpLejh5SU5tLWdJMXA5d1IxTkI2TEdHZjhkNlE2N1lpbDRwUUVDUmNOdEtER245Z1E9PQ==

this is just such a bad take to me to say that you can brute force <number> recall misses the entire point basic embedding models only capture the semantic meaning of the word doing away with multiple meanings and the positional relevance of words in the sentence this is why transformers with attention vectors revolutionized llm performance you can have items in the vector db that use different words to explain the exact same concept of the query and your naive embedding will miss that every time even with brute force so to say <number> of anything when your fundamental baseline for retrieval is inherently flawed just seems like a huge oversight this is why rag is so hard to spend time on its fundamental mechanisms are inherently broken and most people dont even want to address this issue i am glad someone asked this question because it can be hard to find relevant research,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4N2VwUWtTajc2LVM3M19ZWExHODhFODlBektxbzVQY3MzcGhRV3lIRWpBd28telN0dDltOVNSZHJ6ZXF6d2t1N2FZZUlpR3hFbWc4OFNYNGFGZ29OQXc9PQ==

there are a lot of pieces of advice that could apply here but lets start with a few that might be particularly relevant to you <number> have lower expectations jensen huang ceo and founder of nvidia recently offered the following advice people with very high expectations have very low resilience and unfortunately resilience matters in success one of my great advantages is that i have very low expectations i think you could benefit from having lower expectations especially when it comes to the bars that you set for yourself for milestones like being qualified to manage ml scientists being capable of working for a tech company in research etc <number> imposter syndrome is only experienced by people smart enough and aware enough to notice the distinction between imposters and experts fake it until you make it mostly demonstrates that you shouldnt let imposter syndrome hold you back from pursuing the same opportunities that experts pursue sometimes these experts are underqualified and only take the chance on themselves due to confidence a willingness to gamble or true ignorance of their own weakness ie lake wobegon effect <number> embrace discomfort and failure experience mastery and courage are the things you gain after you first need them the best opportunity to grow as a person is to find plenty of opportunities for safe failure because especially for a person with adhd failure can be an indicator that youre finding yourself in new situations that you wouldnt experience if you had otherwise stayed in your comfort bubble sometimes growth is the only way to find happiness and you wont find growth within your comfort bubble <number> have patience and compassion for yourself would you give a person who is exactly like you more compassion than you would give yourself if so this might be an opportunity for you to stop internalizing all of your failures into an uncompassionate perspective that fosters negative selfesteem <number> you dont need to be trapped within a negative outlook imagine that theres a version of you in an alternate universe who is exactly like you except for one key difference heshe doesnt feel the need to place undue importance on negative impressions about themselves and the world around them but rather instead sees things through the lens of opportunity for improvement satisfaction and happiness i know that its all in your head is a truly unhelpful comment when it comes to depression but that term has some truth because only the potential that exists inside of your head can help you see things differently you need to find that outlet for positive thinking within yourself and seek to pause if not entirely eliminate the ruminative negative tendencies that cause you to tend to disproportionately attribute truth to negative perspectives <number> you are worth it i dont wish to imply that some people in society are not worth help and attention but the fact is that humanity needs people like you more than ever i dont know you but ive already spent <number> minutes trying to help you through your problems i would like to believe that my time is valuable so please take comfort in knowing that someone out there is gambling the value of their own time with the hopes that it might help you,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WXJLM25FWlo3cWlMa0tMeDhMNzZxX0E1YnBjeGNYZ3laMkJSYlY4dmVZa0NKZG42SENjU3NmeVBHd1drRVVTNWd2b25jeUZDdFJ0X2hZYy1URUh3NFE9PQ==

hey i think we agree with each other youll see that i say > but i think the biggest reason theres less work being done here is that no matter how good your retrieval gets the quality of your embedding is what will influence the quality of your results how close are relevant things to each other in embedding space the point being that to improve your retrieval you need to make sure relevant informationcontext is encoded in your embeddings this is why in my opinion all the focus is going into building as good of language models as possible rather than tinkering with retrieval as for brute force <number> recall the point is that retrieval now is usually done with approximate search for similar embeddings <number> recall means you find the n most similar embeddings without missing any even if those embeddings are not actually useful to you because of a bad embedding does this clear things up or am i misunderstanding your disagreement,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4VWtBeV9IV2RvOTdyajVoOHRudDdwNDR6OEI0ZGJiNDZfY1l0MENUQmhIT1VPM3hXXzFMRkxIMTdfN21QNU9SZDM3ZjZIYWFrZl9iTWd3bU40OGRLUlE9PQ==

i guess i misinterpreted your use of <number> here that makes more sense thanks for the clarification however still missing how improving overall llm performance is somehow going to solve semantic embeddings though the embeddings used in autoregressive transformers are meant to represent the tokens and the attention layers enrich those embeddings with context thereafter nowhere in the transformer architecture does the model care about the initial wordtoken embeddings retaining context that happens later on in attention layersheads my point being that even with better representations in that initial vector we lose contextual information there still seems to be a need for a retrieval specific architecture which llms do not even aim to achieve atm unless i have missed something,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDMmRPUlg2U1JyYUo4MUFLdWpLVXltWF85dFd5emZoQmQ3ci1tcV91VTBCWmp0SjVzWm9VOVVGRjRRcWJVcXpMMk0wRklVaFVkN3Y4LUxUTVBKNllpalE9PQ==

sure typically you wouldnt extract embeddings from the first layer but rather from the last layer before the lm head how you extract the embeddings at this point depends often the embedding for the last token is used but you can also sumtake mean of all embeddings among other methods the idea is that by the last layer all relevant context should be encoded in each token embedding there are ways to try to be more explicit about dimensionality reduction autoencoders etc but simple methods like this work quite well,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDTm9NcWZ2YWZjSWx4S0xBWmRVeERQTUhDNU90NEpZR1BiOFh1YmhxbTF3eW5nOHp1RzRUb09LaEFJYTRrU3lzeHZ0UG05d244Ti1kTlNwekMxTENINkE9PQ==

i think the real answer is that big companies do not have any smart efficient solutions they just burn money there are various hyperparameter optimization methods but theyre not a great solution to the problem in my opinion efficient ml is probably the most important area of ml research and it will determine the shape of ml in the future you can use second order methods or approximate second order methods but thats not really a solution either they supposedly dont do much better adam for example is already an approximate second order method<url> i think of the optimal learning rate as being a property of the relationships between the samples in a dataset and it therefore is something that must be learned just like any other such property of the dataset there probably isnt a broadly good solution,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDMXFOVFQ5ZXk3NHhPUDk5UXd6ek5OSGp2WTdOM0YyOXgxVEhEUEFfTXhmS2ppdHNoRWVlVHlQRV9EbnlMVFhzQ04yWDBodkNvMkkyM010LUh0WTV1dHc9PQ==

ive spent the last year building a latent music diffusion model including the vae from scratch project is here<url> samples are here<url> when working with signal data in machine learning it is very important that your model architecture respect the underlying symmetries of the data distribution validation vs train performance is largely determined by architecture choices that reflect an intrinsic inductive bias in my experience with music generation specifically d models need a considerably larger number of parameters than d models to reach similar training loss and validation loss is always worse especially with a smaller dataset why frequency is a dimensional quantity and trading dimensions for channels is always a bad trade unless you have no other choice in additional to the aforementioned inductive bias and validation performance the increased parameter sharing in d audio models means your model will train faster as each individual parameter is involved in a greater number of gradient calculations,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDUGZhNkFEVnBtU01FM0dGVUlpSXRiSUYzRnFBZnFEakFDZXV3aktKWnhrWTBSeG1ZNC1RS3k0TWJ1eGI5c3RDRFNfemtoZUFJUXBMWmFWSDRKRTU3d2c9PQ==

representing the operations in onnx should be possible although depending on the version of the standard you are targeting some things can be tricky the most problematic part will likely be the implementation of the runtime or library consuming the onnx model onnxruntime on cpu is usually fine but support for other hardware tends to vary wildly unsupported operators uneven version support partially supported attributes limits on tensor shapes or dimensions i havent used apache tvm myself though so i cant comment on the quality of that framework in particular,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbThpZ0JHb2k3X1VFNGt1YXlGQmtZZXpjYWJvSEtFSUxfLTRDMFJHZTI2QVRJR3E0R09TVjZVclE5OFcwUDIwSVpNMklYcUdvZDlQS1UybnFJaWVVQlE9PQ==

good job but your title and repo name are misleading this is not stable diffusion but is instead ddpm how is it different stable diffusion is a latent diffusion model stable diffusion uses text conditioning without it it would be ldm not sd stable diffusion uses a different unet structure which contains transformer layers not just mhsa also you should look at the ddim paper theres no reason for you to hit every timestep during sampling that would be required if you were predicting nextx but youre predicting eps note that ddim has an eta parameter which recovers the ddpm formulation,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdndKOU9JRmk1OXRTNkpIckRHZ3BLNzBiWHVhZ2JfZGp0YVRpUXE1bFZTNkV6ZExIQU1jQUhPMnFsUHV6cmtRYlN0SzR3Q1Jadlk4WERIX3ZWcmpkSWc9PQ==

thanks all for the links and comments some papers mention an ongoing debate whether this is related to normalization andor mitigated by skip connections fwiw i first noticed the effect wo normalization but with residual connections already in place i think the root issue is the exponential effect by the positive feedback most nns exchange info between spatialcontextual data slots but not with purely datadependent connection strengths attention scores are based on unique data but shared qkv weights and target the same data from all slots in contrast a fully connected layer keeps unique connection weights regardless of data distribution a convolution does share connection weights between spatial slots but those are not datadependent and target unique data neighbours only btw for language models regardless of masking a possible countereffect may be that each context slot does its next token prediction which can actively pull embeddings in diverse directions in later close to output layers,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNnZBOEFISHN0d3lYbG9ycWhqTk1BRU1ob0RfOWVDUk8wN0dKZGZWQkxmR2FENDQ5NEd1OUxCSDlXbUpUMUdoUU1WZldKeFVfSk93RUNxOXhPeFM1eFE9PQ==

i agree with you for me in the beginning it looked a little bit harder but after some time it became more understandable and i think its important to remember that diffusion models are based on other different papersand their math and it took years for researchers to find the ddpm after the gan so im sure its okay to spend some weeks for the math,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdDhIMENsOXlNWXFqaTNMRVlkeUxRUFdBaWlwX3ZFR3labFRNVmJBUHVWcUtrRV9xYUpPX1N2YTFIZDh1WXc2UUhEcWwyWGJDQXJpeUQybE5ncTRDNWc9PQ==

clarifying in the repo does not make up for a misleading title which comes off as deception for the sake of increasing engagement intention is irrelevant only perception by others this is also doing a disservice to ho et al who proposed ddpm instead giving all of the credit to stability while stable diffusion made it popular if you did not include any of the contributions from ldm or from stability then it is a false attribution i dont mean to detract from the effort you put into it but language and optics matter when sharing with others also i believe you misunderstood my statement about the sampler essentially i believe you misunderstood the math for sampling since your implementation implies nextx prediction and not eps prediction its not incorrect but is along the lines of x did y so i am also doing y when y was due to z which is not the case for you in academia this is colloquially called a cargo cult method anyway the typical solution is to allow for a variable number of timesteps which find the nearest points in the alphasbetas grid then you can specify the full timescale or a subset of it but the rationale is described in the ddim paper,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaG51NXY5eVhScGpLT1N4US1EUExuQ19MLUFrUTFkMnVXQ3c0enQwMnFTcmxIQzJhMXc2d0d5TkpEeV9mQ0J6WUtUMnNZRmp3X296dG1qc3QwTlFyUUE9PQ==

i read ops title and didnt really see any problems with it but > this is also doing a disservice to ho et al who proposed ddpm instead giving all of the credit to stability this is such a good point on a semirelated note since you seem to know a lot about these diffusion models i recently reread the deep unsupervised learning using nonequilibrium thermodynamics paper which is where the idea came from and whom ho et al cited and i was a bit confused why that paper didnt actually take off since the methodology they describe is basically the one still being used in diffusion papers what exactly was ho et als contribution the ddim contribution i get but the ddpm one is as you said predicting the next one which is what the original thermodynamics paper was doing as well,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOThUTkpnV0VRM0pIZXotbGd6Zk5mTHM4c0FscVp1b3h4djRwazJHRGtKT3pvaFZ0bThfTm85Q19iU1lSYU9HVWp2NlFOZFBReUFYR3NHUDNSVzFmTENMbVBYZ1N6OGFaOGFfTDNXcHdoYU09

i think i gave credit to ho et al because at the beginning of my repo i stated that latent diffusion models are based on diffusion models and i wrote an math explanation of diffusion models because the math of ldm is the same as in dm in the references i included links to dm paper and other sources with great mathematical explanations of dm i think my title draws attention from people who are not familiar with dm or who want to learn it in detail my repo is just an entry point for them my sampling method calculates the noise or eps at every step from the model having this eps we can calculate the expectation and with fixed variance we can derive the formula to calculate the image at the previous step anyway thank you for your comment i realized that its better to understand the ddim paper ,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSTVJdHVUZjlILTlRd2RJZlpOMnppSV85anlpOTlpUDd6Y2VzeVhOVE1VSjgxNDZFTDJoQWtjYUxlMUM3VVFPMEk2QnozdUdDaWQwVHNOLThxUzkzS1E9PQ==

as someone who worked with both seniors and juniors in a startup setting do not hire someone because theyre cheaper seniors are important for the foundation with good reason theyve seen it done before they know what infrastructure they need they know certain pitfalls and theyre better suited to let you know what is likely to work students dont they have to learn things what the industry teaches over several years whether because of scale or because it needs to become an actual product not just a paper if you do not have a senior yet do not hire a junior even if it seems like their research was relevant if you have a senior and you need to increase research bandwidth go right ahead a senior may support <number><number> juniors at most without feeling like theyre babysitting but make sure they are involved in the process let them interview and select their team members,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMURVWUw2WnRJTmNYYXgwbDBVaGxTckpnRUNQbFhZSG1nSnhWdk5SbHBCOUpFUjA3c2dpSFhPUlJmdFBaOXlwTVJGaDRZZzctT0dBTXZwOGZEWFNSZ2c9PQ==

im not exactly sure from a fundamental perspective i believe hos contribution was the inclusion of the noise schedule which allows direct corruption of images with random noise rather than applying a markov process it also could have been the use of a unet + scale however from a practical perspective his contribution was showing that diffusion models can produce high quality images the deep unsupervised learning paper showed generative results on mnist which is an easy problem but showed poor results on cifar a much harder problem whereas ddpm showed very good results on cifar and then showed the same method works on celebahq and lsun which i believe was the first time a nongan was able to achieve quality like that there may be more nuance to the differences though my background with diffusion models is more so on the architecture side rather than the math also i think optimal transport ie flow matching is easier to understand than thermodynamic diffusion especially since it boils down to computing a odesde the implementation is easier too as shown by the sd paper,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdm9obXNZeEo2cVdkYWozXzk1M3Zid3lUS1p6M1FUWUtUV2RpS0FoSVVPd1FHOFJNcHpkS3VlUjVQWFd3MWY5UDFFX3pYeUg2MlRabEtLVzBkQ0VxUGc9PQ==

i think the main problem is even humans could think they know do you know what you dont know maybe i think i know and then i figure im wrong an ai could say a guess in something and maybe is wrong what if it was trained in the wrong data maybe just check that the model has enough data to answer in a given topic,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbkFBUDBxQ1Fxck85N0NlazkxWHFURGdtYl9YbWdfRXFvWmpYNURyVjAyd1U5NjFyQlNGZ2dfdjN6cEhEc3BpY2Jybk5zNnhoRUxQczJ5S1pPVDY1c0E9PQ==

its extremely normal to be given boring projects if youre inexperienced since this is your first job theres a ton of stuff you need to learn about professional software development that you didnt learn in school even a boring project like this is a huge learning experience for you if you want to work on more interesting stuff you need to prove you can do a great job on the boring stuff then ask to work on a more interesting project the best way to work on interesting projects is to propose your own project but this requires experience,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRmxrMUFnekJLYnRocC1YWkpEOU40cmhkdU9ZY0ZRWDRaSkJJeE1hUXR6Q3BKZk9LZGZleV9tNTJZNDZrRDFmcjhLTUlJUHVhRGoyMTIzeUt6QXUydmc9PQ==

if you want to apply ml knowledge more extensively i wouldnt say you need to be a reseacher i would say though that research scientist jobs are more likely to get you there but even research scientists at faangs sometimes have to demonstrate value and work on engineering for part of their time maybe as a set allocation of time or a temporary reorg many engineer positions at startups can also get you there without a phd even and still do actual valuable research that would be worthy of at least submitting to a journal and get close to publication and many corporate jobs nowadays offer research engineers or stuff close to that but those jobs tend be just as limited as ml reseach scientist,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY1I0XzJicHFtc3RGM0lNaElZTk1nWlNlU2w4dUhZNkMydTlXM1hvV0Ytc1diZ2FnQkdtY2FPeDRzX2JKT3dkT0pMM19YMUloVjVGb2ZvYjI5V0hPdFA5QWtRZ2JhUjdwUEs0c2MyaXF0NVE9

interesting results but allow me to share a couple of thoughts i had first standard fixedsize floating point variables do not constitute a legitimate continuous variable regardless of the number of bits being used they too very much encode a discrete state this might sound like pure nitpicking when obviously de facto the range of values available is so much greater that conceptualizing it as continuous is not going to make a huge difference most of the time but i feel like it hurts the analysis of whats going on here by turning the narrative into a blackandwhite discrete vs continuous when its a whole spectrum encompassing both the number of available states to represent as well as their distribution with floating point representations typically choosing to sacrifice a consistent precision over their range and numerical stability in exchange for a much wider range of allowed values while fixedpoint representations generally follow a much simpler uniform distribution in theory if the discreteness is really contributing something meaningful it should be possible to have a whole matrix of results bridging the whole range from discrete to continuous illuminating exactly how performance is affected by each property second im not <number> certain if im getting the part with the comparison between what you a little confusingly since the actual representations are almost reversed from what those names suggest at a glance in my view call quantized vs multione hot representations but if im following it correctly then > our results also suggest that the superior performance of discrete representations is not necessarily attributable to their discreetness but rather to their sparse binary nature im not sure i agree that this conclusion necessarily follows here also i think you mean discreteness im sure theres a joke here about the lower information states not prodding for details my thinking is that what you call a quantized representation might well simply be less conveniently distributed for the calculations the model needs to do by spreading the information over several inputs in a somewhat haphazard manner youve added something the model needs to use its capacity to learn to undo essentially another potential angle of confoundment is from the loss > the quantized model is trained with the squared error loss but otherwise both models follow the same training procedure if im interpreting this correctly and perhaps im not it sounds like your gradient is lying about the underlying topology for the sake of improving the learning signal ie the gradient isnt accurately depicting the quantization present this could be totally okay or it could be hurting the models performance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblJROWFlMkRMSUJTUmZCOFRHczZMRUlsLWRYSFBraHJsWmJEbXJZY2FpY19sNENMSTM5aTM1UThvNVFuVjFXSU9XclRxcjRYYUN2QUl3eVdXRmFyWGc9PQ==

if you dont need a managed service and dont require realtime writes things like qdrant or faiss can be completely hosted inmemory in a normal kind of way eg you could technically just have the vectordb on s and hotreload it in your web service as long as everything fits in memory one notsocrazy thing ive seen is hosting faiss on triton and exploiting the python backend as a way to save cost by reusing existing infra now if your usecase and deployments require you to write and read in realtimewell thats a different problem i can see technically with caching + streaming you may get away with some of the things i said above eg triton with their polling of the model repository for changes for example,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRGZSMjd1LXV0aDByWjk5QkgydWpNRk9KS1BwLVFrZEQ1N3N3M0N3bTZ4SXlwb196MDZGVk9Wd21heDZ5SVU3R1QxUHJCY0V6WmRMRGIwcFdyMGxJUXpYd19ieGJtRk1FTU0yaDEtMTNCNnM9

i think my biggest questions would be what augmentation options are available and how are the augmentation options selected there are some augmentation problems that i would genuinely pay to have someone else deal with but these also tend to be highly restrictive problems i dont think id pay for a service that just offered a standard add noise rotate shear etc as i can do that quite quickly if needed often we would need special permission to send a dataset offsite so for us to use a service like this the problem would need to be sufficiently difficult if the user had to select what augmentation options they wanted themselves id only be interested if the augmentation options were things that i couldnt get elsewhere or are extremely hard for me to implement if i can implement it in numpytensorflowpytorch within a week via either coding it myself or using a github repository i likely wouldnt use the service as it would take longer for me to get permission to use the service than it would if i just did it myself throughput would be another issue how quickly could a very large dataset be augmented,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUUYyWnA4aXFNVnQ2REZ5VExUYmNHVjVNWFFDRjh1S3EtelVVcFZMUElyV3RwcUliWk9Wd2hCU2pueWlBUkhRZ2YwOXpMcHJKMkFGemxFZDRRaGtKcFE9PQ==

i was in the same boat first job about a year ago take it as a chance to get really good at software engineering and soft skills which is most of an mles job anyway you can often end up with a lot of free time to chat to non devs at the company and scout for other projects my current lineup of projects is good mix of browser automationweb scraping setting up local inference and openai api calls i dont really understand the hate for prompting it produces results with minimal time and money investment why is it any lesser than something like hyperparameter tuning because the unwashed plebs can do it too non ml people will often hit many invisible walls with things like tokenisation understanding inference bottlenecks realistic expectations of what is possible or easy breaking down large projects into sensible pipeline steps so your ml knowledge still has great value even just prompting,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN1lsZ1B3OGhzWndTd2JOWGhhMnpiWFRFS3lLVlJxbGxGUGNMenl6cS1MUElSSzUxYVVRaU1iZXlhWTZ6LUFHSFh0NkhjY09CNWNyZW1jWjU3dDcyckE9PQ==

buying a vector db in a can at retail is expensive because vendors are selling convenience to people who are desperate to build solutions quickly due to ai hype you can buy that same compute at gcpawsazure for a fraction of that cost and openai is going to pay even less at volume they likely also develop their own software also realistically if i were running a service like openais i wouldnt store the data in a huge living vector db instead id persist each companys data in a localoriented vector db in cloud storage and then swap them in to an application server at time of use with some caching to avoid unneeded swaps so much of the data in their system is cold it just doesnt make sense to pay for hot storage for it,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa254MHExelZpOVlxeW02WERRcVMtTjJ3eTBJUlI1bFN1SnNGTGtUbnNpMF90UUU5MG9TWlhtQW9oa2NiaGl0anNNeWJITG45MVRqU1NYX1RCUG4xWVE9PQ==

if you dont apply a mask then indeed there is nothing stopping that information from future tokens flowing to previous ones mixing doesnt happen in the linear layers it only happens in the attention everywhere else the rows stay in their own lane technically the equation is more like masksoftmaxqkv where mask is zeroing out the upper triangle in practice eg the huggingface implementation its actually done by adding a large negative number to the upper triangle and then softmaxing but its the effectively the same thing edit indeed every token is processed in parallel this is actually the main advantage transformers have over rnns since you dont have to wait for computation of a previous token to start on the next one,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMFFXV3F3QlpHQ1Z1MzRqZnJIV243Ty0xWXlNZWloTDU4Tl93bklsMzNSQUx0c0VlYnFaM0NXalFnMExYNGg3dGFtUHNEb1FsenB0d3N2VUhGUW9LMFE9PQ==

you can use llms to do classification as well but usually they perform better if the text classification task is its own api call and no other asks are in the same prompt but this will add to latency,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTXJGWGlYQ2l1ZmtzU3hBOGRjUzQ4YndvNFdodWJfU2ItVzdzN01vVy1BWXhCYTh1eGFmbjF3TTFnejFkZ0U1N0pNUjVpNUx1VnRoaXRMS3RRZlhWN0E9PQ==

i think this is highly dependent on the task some tasks llms have already been implicitly trained on and are as good as dedicated models and some tasks llms cannot perform well at all for example anything requiring numerical reasoning is best left to a dedicated model the best thing would be to take a small sample of your data and check the quality of both if you are going to use an llm though the best practice is to give it multiple examples in the prompt and if the task is complex prompt it to write out its reasoning stepbystep with examples,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV1hVMDdXTFJSY0Z5RWVhM1ZuWVdJaGdhY1RKVDl0TVQxWHhxaE8wQnJCeGM5Mi16a185bkFqNnlNU0xlUDlSbEdlRnBQeEFhT2lhXzhySW1zVjEyV2c9PQ==

thanks for checking out the work and thanks for the thoughts in a way you are certainly right that both types of representations are really discrete but thinking of it this way doesnt quite make sense in the context of the work it doesnt make sense because we represent discrete and continuous values differently each discrete variable is represented by a onehot encoded vector whereas each continuous variable is represented by a floatingpoint value as opposed to a onehot encoded vector with <number> billion elements that being said the fta results are meant to be a sort of a bridge between the two methods and we do see that it does almost as well as the discrete method despite being a fuzzy discrete on the second point youre hitting the nail on the head despite the experiment being perhaps overly complicated the point is simply that the way the data is represented matters its obvious but important to show i think in the context of this work and especially to show how much of a difference it can make the idea is that there is nothing special that the vqvae learns that the vanilla ae doesnt its just that the representation of what is learned by the vqvae is more conducive to learning,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSS1tbF9IQzA5UmhjdV9MdDN1ZVp2ZkF6VnlvOHZIOGJNYUtleThYMTFhbG1la0UyV2V0T0lCaGtRV1ozMFA4aXdRekZRV0JsdVozbnlUMG1DUGRkbFE9PQ==

say you have an use case where you are trying to help users query their database but the users also ask things like hey what can you do for me who are you and so on which is about bots identity and capabilities in this scenario if the main prompt which in this case is the querying one gets complicated it will not handle the out of context questions like bot capabilities so you add an intermediate call which identifies whether the question is about database querying or capabilities or any other intent then based on the response different paths of code with different prompts and other things are executed,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLWNxYjJKQm80Zm9ZWGRLekplOXBzUlZjWDV1NmZMTlhRbElRZ1ZFZWt3aEU2TDJXTFhsNlFQQU1yV05aYnlrNVVSMEVveVNHMGNVb0xkdUFaNEFQZ1E9PQ==

in my experience llms can do a pretty good job at classification too but it requires very specific prompts its important to not only provide a detailed description of what kind of queries each request serves but its as important to provide several examples of what kind of user questions would lead to which request being called make sure to cover all the edge cases too cases where choosing between requesta and requestb isnt obvious or may be ambiguous you can also try using few shotzeroshot ners or text classification models from huggingface to help you since you wont need to train from scratch and may be faster than building your own model,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZWhqYzRRVG1iemlhTmhFUUVHbU80b1NKSlA2NXROQzhUcXJaRWVLdFhvZWxUYXlodXBNaWh2YkhQZlFQWFNFc3FSTG1KNDdwVURocHd6a1ZneFNFWmc9PQ==

yea i actually like those i had a take home test over a year ago for some startup that was doing agi and the test was to implement a probabilistic float implementation and i did not get the job but i was so glad that i took the time to do it because i learned so much about how floating point works internally that i didnt really know and that led me to doing a personal project on compression using arithmetic coding which required detailed knowledge of floats because in arithmetic coding you are essentially encoding all the data into a single nbit float where n is a function of how much data youre saving something tedious like data cleaning i wouldnt do but if its an interesting question i feel like im back at school trying to figure out a problem set and learning a lot in the process,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX0xZbGxDcE1jbG92U0lEcmNEVC1OM3d4WTFIX0ZkSnR0X3pzMFVNZm40YVRwdF9PZnZQcU9kMzFja25HdTkzcWdXWUhhNldESE54aHU0Snhic0hPZi0xMGJXNHZxMzE0WHN5d2tMWG9XOVk9

you need to keep in mind that its a two step process when you have vqvae you have input image > encoder > quantized latent > decoder > reconstruction during the first stage of training the model is doing this process to learn a good code book and therefore good latent space once the model has converged you have a latent space of shape c h w where c is the dimension of the vectors in the code book if we feed any properly quantized latent code we should get a corresponding image therefore sampling the latent space lets us sample image space for the second step to generate latents the transformer generates each of the hw vectors autoregressively and you train it to do this we can do this because the latent space is quantized so its just next token prediction with a vocabulary equal to the codebook size so the generation step looks like transformer > quantized latent > decoder > generated image the reason you do it in two steps is because if you dont the transformer is fitting a probability distribution to a latent space that is itself shifting as the autoencoder is being trained this is unstable,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQzVXeEhIWnR6MFVSOGk2a3Z0VzE1OW40V05NVF9HWjRVblk4Y2Z6N0ZaeXBETTJPNVJPczRDeVNkN2JmdmFEWm1RWlpQUjFhclVpa2J0bWFTeG54WlJFWmVXc0ZZV3F1WFRlVjdsU3pWX3M9

id recommend against hiring offshore until you have enough staff to vet them students are good but will take about a year to really develop if you can afford one decent middletosenior and keep them happy you can hire a few other recent grads to round out your team or if you have the luxury to wait a year for them to grow you can chance it with recent grads but keep in mind they tend to wildly overinflate what they can actually do without expert guidance,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU2tCYnZGRFpWQjA0YTFtVkktNkkyU19rbEdjck14c1AzZnBxeUpISW9oSDQ2dlh0OWJPa0wzRHFSNFd5QWV1VDhqdGlubWtiR1NWUlNYU1Y3WFFCSHJMbTFIckNPUF9JM1g5Z2R1ZXd0dmc9

this is great thank you it reflects my thoughts on the work im currently doing and provides some justification for my thinking i think that youd enjoy reading about what andrew gordon wilson and his team is researching not at all immediately related but his perspectives on inductive biases is fantastic the power of an overly expressive model backed up by wellchosen and useful inductive biases is potentially the lynchpin of modern ml the way i interpret your results is within that framework worth musing over for you i think,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS2ZMdFNaMkhIaGpjVGg5S3A5OF9CNW5YVmVTSEZtWGNjSkp3MXpudGxPWnRmMzVhejBsYnFxVzN2M0dwdGtzeDhlYTY5Y21pbTJyZkswVEZTa3pGdlE9PQ==
the vqvae itself is trained only to reconstruct images so you give it an input put it through the network and enforce similarity between in and output after that is completely done you next can train pretty much any generative model that can generate discrete sequences in this latent space so usually the first thing you do is take your entire training set and compute the latent encoding for each one then you train a generative model in this latent space this can for example be done with masked prediction similar to masked token prediction used in language modeling its similar in concept to how latent diffusion models work you first train the vae which has a continuous latent space unlike the vqvae and then train the diffusion generative model on the distribution of encoded images so we dont use the vqvae as generative model here instead its really just a mapping that transforms data to a lower dimensional subspace on which we then train the generative model this is done since the latent space has much lower dimension than pixel space so it makes training the generative model easier,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVURfc2E2QzVZa044MlR6bWE1elVuSlIzLVIwcVVsZy1qTWVhNXNCblZCUTI0aURFU1Zrblg3MndEbjR6UmVUS0pkVE1wMUJDbWRpNzRKQk5VVUNFVlE9PQ==
ive spent a lot of time working on chatbots in an ecommerce startup so feel free to message me to discuss further detail but i would say that using llm api endpoints for each individual task is a perfectly fine starting place its true that llms are most uniquely good at text generation but they are also great for task classification with little to no fine tuning examples the issue is that smaller models can get equally good or better performance when finetuned or trained on your data and the smaller models will be faster and more efficient just make sure to separate each task into its own api call and dont just mash everything into one prompt but using an llm for every task is like using a nuke to solve every problem it will work as an mvp but more precise solutions can be implemented over time as you improve the system,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVGNTSGd3OUQxMFpnVnVoNENSZVEyZ2dhVnhteXBNODBtSk1qbVhTdWxFTll5cVJkSzV1OW5YOXNqbGZGaVZBdE5RZGRsc3p3RVQwT2RjSXRFb2M3Rnc9PQ==

generating each code index is equivalent to generating each of the hw vectors just map each of the hw indices to their vectors generating a new image is as simple as passing the latent code through the decoder the transformer is in charge of generating the latent code which has shape c h w also h and w here are the input image size divided by some number usually <number> or <number> so in a sense each vector corresponds to some patch in the generated image but also not really,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadmJPMkhZenB2d2tFU1pqLTJiLU9nNHlFYUdiTTVHN0VkQlY3SzJZamdTM01HdTFUVHlvSC1wZGZmR0NNVU5VRS04cUwwUjZrcHVkRDhGcWZZS3h4U0o3NWRlMFgzTmRKWDFtMWNjZzhPTjg9

so your saying that a single latent vector is responsible for generating the image like in vqvae then what does the transformer do it doesnt change the codebook so what it does it outputs a latent vector in the codebook or arbitrary latent vector i dont understand the prediction a single vector is used to generate an image yet the transformer is used multiple times for multiple patches so its not a single latent vector im sorry if i sound dumb,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX1c4UG5TNkNIWGp2eUdSbV8yamk3bGtvdmtEcVVKYko5VmtBb1lERUh3aHBmVjNmR1lrV3F3SERKNHBRYjdUdFVZbHh4U2o0TEpfMDBRdGVqV2VuVmc9PQ==

by vector i mean code book entries so you might have c=<number> and codebooksize <number> for example now the latent space of the encoder has shape c h w in other words it is a collection of hw latent vectors so its not a single vector that decodes to an image its a collection of them therefore if you have hw vectors you can create an image okay so how do you get those vectors since the codebook is discrete really what we want to do is predict a sequence of indices with length hw so we do this with autoregression predicting the next token in the sequence based on the previous ones,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRlVJRkx1c2t5UUNKTW9nWmxOZml1ZHhaZXIzV3pFVEhucXJrRnFqeXh6M21hZmdnTm95dDNpanI5TWZTbVB3eFJ2RGU2ZmxSaERfYUZwVTcwUjlKWm51U1pXa2t1XzZUN2xGdGYwNnFaX2s9

i actually found it works well when you use it for things its designed for in my use cases gnn noneuclidean data normal nn anything you can make euclidean keep in mind with enough parameters you can model euclidean spaces with extra dimensions to the noneuclidean dont have time to link math proofs but you can find them online easily which means you can usually get away without gnn if you just add more parameters however gnn work really well for variable data sizes,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOWhlTUxiWUdJMkFDa0M4NWxqeDI2LXc1dE1WNnVzSTJMR3hDc1FfVjkxQnFOdEdWZU5YakpoOHVQcXJ0RTlZR1Y4MFhNOEJvMTA2Y1JUalgyQm92U3JOUHl6XzdqYzg0NG1YZHZiY1g1aGs9
i think there are a lot of uses for graph ml because so many problems can be defined as graphs however i think with these problems there are lots of overlapping domains where you can use a more approachable algorithm to solve the problem much more easily without bothering with graph conventions or frameworks like if you want to figure out a simple way to predict graphs consisting of ten nodes connected in a row you might as well simply consider it as a regression problem maybe that isnt the best example but hopefully you get what i mean,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT0VGclBUaDV4LW9udVl6Njhsd1hwLVp5bUhiV1B6R1ktbUdodWxkaWgwdEwwNFhUai1jWU5NQWxBcVRmZGFjY0tNcGlyWHJ4MTl4MEZ4c2lBd3B6Y1E9PQ==
i personally would say is you need to determine if your data is euclidean or not your data is euclidean therefore normal nns can work fine you also need to try things like graph attention that give it context size like a transformer in different directions,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabjAyckU5Z2x1bC1ReGg0OTNMRHpYaElvRll1TEppb3JXQlBMa0R1VXkwUHhHVnNFV3FmWFJSMEZwTWxDOFNTbi12TkRjY3JRRmlXSU90TTE4MnBWLWtiNXZYVHF0cTZqc3Bfb2VOQXdmQUk9

it doesnt really converge hence does not work well why some say its because of oversquashing which kinda makes sense for certain problems you can think of transformers as bipartite graphs a subset of graph neural networks so transformer working better than gnn makes sense,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNackF2SVhIb1pmcWRCa0J5RkZOT2xONFI5TWNDbzhtbDBKVmlYM1kwY090R3Iybm5jOGRXTkZFdElwakh6RWRPTXBQaG8tcW9ZaE9tbnZCdnJ3RUtzbEE9PQ==

this comment is confusing did you mean that it improves space but not time complexity because that is true since we do not really change the number of operations we just optimize the memory operations which is space not time and it gives the speed up simply because we use a faster memory throughout although i would argue that a reducing the number of memory swap calls can be seen as time complexity since we reduce the number of operations in the algorithm which by the way kind of dominate the runtime and b they do kernel fusion to merge several operation together and i am not acquainted enough with cuda and all this low level jazz but it is possible some sort of time complexity reduction might be happening there,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWkxMS210OFpLU0xDMEJpSXlHMmlsWS11RWZPbkdqbG11c2lCdGVqYkxaczducy1feW1CVlVYRG1lb1RRX1loTExvRERLUjdSRzVYalFPUXRjazY2blE9PQ==

deepminds project learning agile soccer skills for a bipedal robot with deep reinforcement learning also known as the op soccer project is a fascinating exploration of how advanced machine learning techniques can be used to teach a bipedal robot to perform complex tasks such as playing soccer the project uses a technique known as deep reinforcement learning which is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal the agent is rewarded or penalized based on the outcomes of its actions and over time it learns to make better decisions to maximize its rewards in the case of the op soccer project the agent is a bipedal robot and the environment is a soccer field the robot is trained to perform various soccer skills such as dribbling shooting and passing by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback the video of the experiments from this project showcases the impressive results of this approach the robot is able to perform a variety of soccer skills with a high degree of agility and precision demonstrating the potential of deep reinforcement learning for teaching complex physical tasks to robots however its important to note that while the results are impressive there are still many challenges to overcome in this field for example training a robot to perform tasks in a controlled environment is one thing but getting it to perform reliably in the real world with all its unpredictability and complexity is another furthermore training a robot using deep reinforcement learning can be a timeconsuming and computationally intensive process overall the op soccer project is a significant step forward in the field of robotics and machine learning and it opens up exciting possibilities for the future,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRlZOT21abHlqd2lvVHQxUU9rZnRNeF9DT1FDcm4tb0lZNGZwV0ZPWlBYTGdOSmVTYVJMODFHWTJnWlNEV202X3gtdkc2UURkWG4tVzVzbkFFbnhWOTdkZGNOMWpsUk9XY1VSM09ZMlpIXzQ9

because if you have neural networks you can have transfer learning and this is a huge deal in chemistry typical datasets can have about <number> samples and sometimes can be as low as <number><number> and since the data is naturally graphbased hence gnns although the pretraining only really started working quite recently <number> and later and using pretrained models is really dead simple just like with cnns or transformers and also nice things like eg interpretability since gradient tracking is really more reasonable than what you can do for most molecular fingerprints continous representations also make more sense generally than discrete ones which are typically the result of feature engineering but textbased models on smiles representation for molecules and on fasta for proteins seem to work great so well see what the future will bring,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUm9BNDZPMEpCdVpVSU1TbzRZS0c3N2pKS0ZpOXVvVjlrMEotUUlCTkNHWlAwTnpoS05UTkEwV0VvTWhkcWQ5MnhKdWNPUUQ3UkhaWmc5UHVndGZLSHc9PQ==

the comment youre responding to seems to be drawing a distinction between runtime and algorithmic complexity improving the complexity would be like turning an on^<number> algorithm into an on log n algorithm improving runtime would be like turning something with runtime <number> n^<number> + <number> n + <number> seconds into <number> n^<number> + <number> n + <number> seconds notice that both are on^<number> so basically if the new runtime is bounded by a constant multiple of the old runtime then the time complexity hasnt changed,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYl96cXozUXJFRERodHlEV3ZIYzJYSXk3VDQ4RndTR1pZM25CTTdhR3NVWG1zVkliX2hhekZwNWJKcnJNalljM05nS2lPYm5HOVp5OEtoRnFUUF9ZWEJnYUg2Tm5TTUYxelB5TktnWkJUQmM9

you cannot really answer this however classical statistical learning theory predicts that the estimation test error decays of the order of <number>sqrtm where m is the number of samples so for an error eg accuracy in classification of <number> you would need ballpark <number> data points this is theory and also there are potentially massive constants involved still it may be a guideline,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN2NKbmhQdEZjaWlucE9MSG40RG01T0ZSU19qMHhmWjNqaEdaMEs4RXlTbFFMcFRkSnhpMHZNRHNMRU0wS0tLck5fMUZBMV9oaXN2bUNKdC1kdzZsV1E9PQ==

i also work with medical data so i am very familiar with the problem getting more data can be extremely expensive i dont think there is a way to give a definite answer but here is what i do when asked this question i artificially limit the number of samples during training and evaluate on a fixed set using whatever metric is useful for the task then it continue to include more and more of the available samples and i look at the how the performance changes between the training runs you can do crossvalidation for each of the runs to improve your measurements for each data point make a plot and extrapolate the results it usually gives you a rough indication when you will hit a plateau obviously that is not a definitive answer it is modelspecific and you already need enough data to get at least meaningful results usually management wants to know before they start the project but in that case i can just guess,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad21HeXp4eFd0bEdxR2V2ZnRVS1BqcmNpYU9aME1tVUVJUzI3aXBWaWlGOTVnT1F2Tk03YlpKOEtSS3dmS3hjY1Y3QlFDUUhVenFzVmYtSVdOS082OTRVWXhhS0dHZkZDNmdqNng4ODR4alE9
you can look at it a bit more empirically lets say you have <number> data samples split in <number> test samples and <number> training samples now you train many models on a training set with increasing number of samples and note down the final errorloss on the training and test set you can plot this and see how the errorloss changes with increasing number of samples with above example you could run <number> trainings with <number> <number> <number> sample sized training set at lower numbers you can also average over kfolds the test set stays at <number> at all times it should look something like this sketch <number> the plotted value is the final errorloss after each training is complete for of samples = <number> the training error is very low as the model overfits and the test set error is very high as you increase the number of samples the training error increases and the test error decreases at some point the test error sort of upper bounds the training error for samples > inf the test error should converge to the same value as the training errorish depending on where in this curve you are you can decide how much more data you need if you are at the beginning of the blue curve you need more data if you are at the end of the blue curve there are diminishing returns <number> <url> edit similar to passionatepossums answer,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWXREVkRZeVlSQktSQVVnZER2X3NSX0lVN2VNZ3JIdDVOeEFQV21tdGIwc3pIdzJxN2lCc0hyVXNtNEdzeFFjS2hqVDVCcFF2ZVE0ZGR3TklEenVaaEE9PQ==

> monoliths are by nature strongly coupled systems in which each entity is heavily dependent on the functioning of other entities and cannot be independently accessed or scaled this is not strictly true monoliths can have submodules that are strictly tested independently additionally while they can be deployed as one piece one can deploy subsets of the service differently across many machines eg routing celery tasks etc additionally monoliths allow for having complete and compatible code that one can easily run without much overhead where microservices often are plagued with mismatching versions and poorlystyled code that teams fail to navigate,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWXVwWjRGaXZXclJRVzM1bk5VWDVoNXVtQUpMSTZFQmN5LUNJcTU0N2llVW1NOTFRZlZyUTJ0Y0xaWUtjbUpKa2FPa0RkS1FVdUhxN01hTEZtcmFSaEE9PQ==

this is what massive companies have massive teams for basically impossible but here are my very opinionated two cents <number> you will definitely need to include rmse at the very least and have rules to choose between the mape and rmse mape gets a lot of hate but it is generally ok if all of your values are greater than like <number> or so if less than that then use rmse i hate mase so dont use that <number> this does not seem like a scalable solution hyperparameter tuning across all of those methods will be computationally expensive if you have to handle millions of time series you may want to make some adhoc logic to hone in on a smaller subset of the models and parameters to try like do tests for seasonality and if its not seasonal do only nonseasonal parameters segmentation can be your best friend in these problems <number> you will probably encounter a ton of intermittent time series im not saying you need a croston in the mix i am also not a big fan of croston haha but i would add something that can handle that scenario well like imapa or thief temporal aggregation stuff always does well for me <number> you are overprocessing your series outliers are a slippery slope and i prefer methods that are more robust to them rather than removing them but that also will depend on the size of your data if you can take advantage of those methods sg filters on every series is also a lot i wouldnt ever smooth my data unless my eyes tell me i need to in other words i would never do automatic smoothing so dont do automatic smoothing <number> a lot of time series is hierarchical by nature and a system that doesnt take that into account will cause lots of headaches for you when the client looks in aggregate and sees wonky stuff now if this is me i would think about that segmentation piece i mentioned before if you have a large number of decent time series meaning <number> many observations and many seasons <number> not super intermittent then i would take that bundle and fit an auto nbeats on that for the super intermittent fit imapa then the rest i would do smootherssarimax if that nbeats sample size is small like only <number> time series then fit them with smoothers if the client provides hierarchical data then do a hierarchical method on top so the aggregates look ok this also doesnt even get into exogenous data if you have that then it might be best to do automl trees but be careful of long range forecasts if you do a recursive fit a trees performance here depends on if the signal from the exogenous axis is stronger than the signal from the time axis if it isnt then nbeats will probably win out if you have complicated and multiple seasonality then replace smoothers with tbats if your data is nice then nbeats is probably best if your data is messy then smoothers are probably be safest,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNEx1WHZJeVJjTWNRc1NkejBEMEdKNU5FWlY3VFhjcHo3WDh6dEhoZnJkTlQ3NFNmVHJGRGM3My1FLW1jdk0yU3hUTG1VbTEtUl9WelVSTzFrd1VobEE9PQ==

there is a massive difference between the concrete goal oriented focus of reinforcement learning and the conceptual frameworks that agi operates in the reason that ai safety focuses on agent based concepts is mainly because no matter the underlying framework any ai system that acts in the real world will necessarily be attempting to achieve some goal else it would not be acting in the real world its not making a prediction that agi will necessarily come about due to rl based agent frameworks the current state of the art and the issues with them and their intelligence are a separate issue much of the concerns about agi and asi specifically focus on ai systems that can do something the fact is that if an ai system lacks the inherent ability to perform actions in reality like current llms it is infinitely less dangerous that a true agiasi would be,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneFNHWVhjWElTVWVpei1HbVdDUTMxTnpzRzFieVlFZDE3eUpxWjJfYWtEMFJyaU9FMjE2cjlsZmhpRXFnZHBKX0VQNUNUbzFWMk15cHZsc0J4a0dnb2c9PQ==

this line is more from a software engineering perspective easy to use frameworks will make you overlook the actual source code for implementing the functionality with a lot more abstraction brought in now it makes it more difficult for you to troubleshoot should you face any issue with that piece of code customisations beyond the parameters allowed will be difficult underlying code can be inefficient for the way you utilise the functions in your code i believe that for a production ready code you should have complete control over your code also dependence on such library would make you look for all functionalities within the framework say you are using it for semantic search using a certain embedding model and a vector db then your would of course expect to use the same framework for incremental indexing or authentication in the vector db and you would be disappointed to find that the implementation for the same is not as thorough though existing i have experienced the inefficiencies difficulty in troubleshooting and customisation to my requirement level etc i have found similar feedback for other such frameworks as well afterall this field in itself is quite new and evolving fast hence use langchain or other such frameworks only when you can verify and be comfortable with the actual source code of the functions youll use you should be in control of the code in production it being possible with a popular framework is one thing but the lure of being lazy about it is also quite possible that recurrent character text splitter might be a good enough chunking approach for poc but eventually you will need to customize and have a proper chunking strategy based on your use case btw i do use langchain in production because i started the poc with it but the functionalities i use are limited after reducing from poc level usage and after my thorough verification of the source code of the functions we use,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTkVBWXJ2eTVwbGJNY0NVa0V4aGtiOXBLbGVhbnp5UG4xaWpHUWtWdFVJT1Ftb1ZFLVhLbFN0THVjM2pacFBySnQ3a0NQYzJEd1JfTWpYOW1SYTJ5T2c9PQ==
yea from my experience if you have a strong model and a clean data you dont need worry about repetition a lot in many situation but for some situation such as math or code they need low temp for correctness in such situation except decoding strategy you may need some postprocess to detect repetion and break it for example when we test the gptturbo we find it if it generate content in some repetition pattern it will break automatically,r/machinelearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZlBGLXpzMG5NZkNVak9JNC1SWkRhWkxmbVVYYUVudmRXQzhTZF80bktnLUJ0alIzc3BSQ3RHaldwU3JJT3lIalgtOFpMZnBiY2diZ0R4OUhCQlNNcmc9PQ==
