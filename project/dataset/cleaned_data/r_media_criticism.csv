while everybody talks about the republicans trying to ignore the constitution the democrats are doing the same thing if the president is unfit lets follow the constitution instead of trying to pick somebody other than vice president kamala harris because old white men dont like her according to the th amendment to the constitution the vice president and a majority of cabinet members can vote to declare a commander in chief unable to discharge the powers and the duties of his office and hand the duties of the president to the vice president do it or stfu,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGaS16aURLXzJkQmY0cWtWVXpOSUU1WkpxczhWYTI2Q21fLS11SDd4dEtHRkNpcW0xb2dzM0xWbzBtYVdlYUl1aHRqSEduVjJyR041Q1VzSVZMTVNmdUE9PQ==

trump is less fit for different reasons everyone saw this last thursday too biden is also too old no doubt and should not be running but trumps problems are so much worse corruption compulsive lying a policy agenda that would destroy accountability and worsen so many building crises i mean the problem with the lying is the reason hes lying that is why does he have to lie so much because his record as president was terrible and his policy agenda is designed to destroy competency in government replaced with trump loyalists see project <number> if you dont see these things its because youre putting too much credence into the fact that trump didnt stumble over words like biden did and this is causing you to ignore that trump is so much worse either that or youre either very wealthy and one of the tiny number of people helped by trumps policies or youre just gullible,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHcVcwM2RRaWktaUE3WENYMUNqSkZTQjV4WXNZMTZ3OEt5YjJUY1Zob3dYVDRpMkx5ai10azNrbnQ2VjVsT05pWWFhNnlTbGFIWG44dXM3bXpieE9lamc9PQ==

every time you ask a conservative to defend their support for donald trump they change the subject to divert attention from his terrible record and from your absence of principles or use some bullshit ad hominem attack like this you guys cannot ever ever use any kind of substantive basis for defending him other than some vague belief based on your conservative ideology that hes got the best policies despite so much evidence to the contrary to answer your question though i dont really want to have any republican friends and i barely can stand to be around someone with such a total absence of principles so im definitely not fun and popular if youre a republican and yet i still have a few republican friends who i just talk to about bullshit like the weather because they arent able to defend their beliefs with any substantive evidence if you ask them but i dont give a shit if someone like you thinks im not fun your party has been gradually destroying our society for over <number> years and you arent even aware of it,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVGtNQ3ZaMk9FWV9MTEM0T252WDYzRU1mRE15QUhDdHIySmZudkMxMTE1UV9ySWp5bTgxOGZiZFduYzZjamstcmsyMS0wSndOdGZzbDB0OFNKQ0VSRHc9PQ==

im not american but the only practical outcome of not voting is that your leastpreferred candidate is more likely to win you may think of it as a protest against the system a proclamation that neither candidate is suitable that the system needs a reboot of some kind the system does not care the system cares only about which number is higher between the two leading candidates low turnout may get a brief mention in news coverage but your still going to be stuck with whoever got the most actual votes for the next few years im in the uk we have an election this week and i posted my vote last night our politics are a shambles too i had more options than you there were i think <number> candidates i could choose from and i still wasnt able to fullheartedly choose any of them but i chose what i consider to be the leastworst strategic option anyway because there are options that i absolutely do not want to win and i want to do my bit to prevent them from gaining power its not much but its measurably better than nothing whatever your politics i dont believe its possible that you honestly think that both candidates are equally as bad as each other they are very different people with very different politics cast your vote for the least objectionable one because not doing so only helps the worst option whoever you believe that to be,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHWlR4YXR5Mmx2YUFvbFZQM2tOaW5ZbGNNZS0ySTQ4RDVtMDlwRlZLNkhZY2haWkI3RXdlc2ZGc09WRERsSVhjc2kzWkJHeEZYVTJ0Snoxb1l3XzRBWFE9PQ==

i blame the people who work closely with biden for not being more honest with themselves and with biden i will say that i think its not difficult to understand how this happens though its like its a big huge deal that biden won the presidency he won he is the president the idea that he or his associates would just easily decide to step aside and let someone else take the job just doesnt make sense almost anybody in his place would stubbornly resist giving that up so certainly the media has some blame too but they can only do so much i dont know who to blame to be honest its not like the other side would do anything different if trump was known to be having cognitive decline the expectations we put on the media to somehow expose things are often frankly ridiculous if i had to put any blame on anyone and i say this as a democratic voter it would be the whole leadership of the democratic party they decide the process for selecting the nominee and if they had a better process for choosing the nominee biden never would have won the nomination it would take a long time to explain but they should have had more debates starting earlier before the <number> election and more aggressive removal of candidates from the debates as time went on instead what we had was too many candidates vying in the primaries and then we had to suddenly panic and put all of their support behind biden simply because he had the best name recognition a better process would have organically led us to the best candidate thats what happened in <number> when obama emerged ahead of hillary,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOT0Nidk92SVIzTF95akdkWXdSeDFRMnA4RXE0TXFfbExIR2tObTJXcS1JcHJXejdYdXpGOXJiUGpFZmoxMDdtNnBLT0ZWdGNwTWJsQ1BWWWtfY3MxcWc9PQ==

sorry but no at what point can trump take blame for the hateful rhetoric that he posts on his platform every day instead of blaming people for for calling him a fascist why dont we blame him for actually being a fascist he literally has promised to seek vengeance and retribution if he had the power to that is what gets some crazed assholes motivated to take matters into their own hands,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMWFyTjFFODVMZ3Bqb3VTRXE4NVdqODhxakdSUGlzSFhYU0FxZm1US2ZZajdmQmdCR0lzaGhhX1IxYU1rSi1nMEF5OFA4ODZlX1ZYLWYweUxJSUk3UFE9PQ==
really so you dont think the constant demonization of trump and the constant stream of bombastic demonstrable lies that come from the left and their compliant media has absolutely nothing to do with it you yourself are calling trump a fascist right now and claiming the label is <number> accurate as though you and everyone else who uses the term as meaningless slur are the a ultimate authority on who is and isnt a fascist racist fascist nazi all terms the left consistently use for no other reason than to vilify and demonize anyone who opposes them by attempting to connect them to the most hated groups of people one can imagine the left has coopted labels that many people including you im sure would use as justification to commit violence against those you flippantly apply them too just to use them as a petty insult in arguments with strangers on the internet claiming that trump hasnt been demonized continuously is outrageous assigning yourself the authority to declare with little to no evidence that people are racist fascist and nazis is outrageous declaring that your determination is unquestionable and those people deserve to have violence committed against them is outrageous pretending that the media and elected democrats havent lied constantly about him is outrageous claiming that trump brought this on himself is just a continuation of that outrageous narrative,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabXBHdXZOQVk5RE12WERvVF9neG1qSzNiazI0N3h0SFB0WTBZTUJhWUpSZUlHcElkVXUzbm5Ga3dhTnI5MUpBcTNvVi1lODRlYmY0cUNMbUwzZUhlTXc9PQ==

submission statement the new york post incorrectly published that the person who attempted to assassinate former president trump was chinese i have no idea what the rationale was by the new york post but this seems like bullshit at a time where asianamericans are already still reeling from the stigma of being associated with covid<number> for the new york post to jump the gun and go after them like this is reprehensible theres a pattern of this type of behavior from the post as well its like they couldnt wait to blame an asian person for this,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQm93TjhUbU1NdlJVSXFVTDh1SDVvX1hxX2ZGekFrODRSVmhaYWZONlV3bFN3aVRZTExub1gxeUpNZU9Gd0luczV5S3M4ZHdjSW1aUDdaalRlbUtWTVE9PQ==

>if anything there was an increase in hatred towards asian americans from other minorities during the post <number> blm movement for having children who perform so well in the schools blm leaders were desperate to characterize as racist the comment that youre replying to didnt even say antiasian racism was coming primarily from white people so im not sure what your point is here or why you bring this up your comment first says that this isnt happening then it says its happening because of other minorities which is it,r/media_criticism,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVC1nUjN3dUE2dC1zNG43aWhwajhxMUdEOXk3YzFxUTNKZzM0SmVoSVZHT3lQT3Y4bXhWdy1sLWdGVlEyWURJbmM4bnpzQU42WGpIVWg5RWNNZjh2WGc9PQ==
