personally i havent had any issues thus far i was simply empathizing with how difficult it can be and can see where this can be a problem i think most would view this as a system issue i can appreciate different practice styles another common issue is patients are told to schedule a followup lab result visit but they decide their diabetic followup visit is close enough they decide not to schedule a lab visit so it is never marked in the next visit notes that this is something that needs to be addressed i am curious how you make sure this eventually gets addressed,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM0VmOGthRENBYjFYZXFoYl9iRzRTaXV5X1RZQ0lwWEtpLWczSTBZemxzcWFqM09OSEZqVENqTWtiQm0tRko1RUo1NkdQUEl3a2N1b1EtdF9DcS14ejlnMVNnVkFwYUNwZ0lhZ3FnOFZ5Zmc9

great questions and very common questions i do recommend reaching out to a therapist to talk about these things one of the great problems with becoming an attending is that youve now actually achieved the goal your entire school life was building to and its just not that fulfilling not saying that its not fulfilling at all but it turns out work is just that work its the same stuff you trained to do its not that different you dont suddenly get more out of it because youre an attending so you gotta find a new purpose other than getting through to the next big thing therapy is super helpful for getting in touch with yourself to figure out what it is that really makes you tick and like sounds like you have some inappropriate guilt might be something worth looking into  me personally i love to learn i love to teach i do it as much as i am able without doing too much free labour cause i am burnt to a crisp and gotta protect myself but i also love going out to eat traveling and going on vacation spending time with my wife and cats playing video games and magic the gathering with my friends this is what i live for now or at least try to because truth be told i feel very similarly to you and ive been out for a bit now,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQzNMeXVNbC1mOXg1Z0I3cHJRV09mT1BkNnZQN0NiUGpoTlVpS2ViNUprTWdXaFR3bkxsTUNTZFJuRkdOVnMxXzdyUk5OaHMyZ3JXdi1TOE5GbnY0TW9oa2pFTElkajBITUVwSGxkd284eEE9
hello im currently m living in a vhcol area making around <cur>k at a large tech company i have been considering switching to medicine for quite a while and wanted to share my thoughts here i never aspired to be a software engineer its just something i happened to fall into i didnt know what i wanted to do in college and studied data science and i just happened to get a job in this space its not all terrible the pay is pretty good and i work a standard <number> hoursweek but i feel like i am rotting away in corporate america all anyone talks about in this sector is saving enough money to eventually quit their jobs i have realized that i dont enjoy reading or writing code in the slightest and i dont think i would last very long in this industry because of this for the past half year i have been spending weekends volunteering at a local hospital and scribing and i find this work to be much more engaging and fulfilling than anything i have done in the tech sector i like working with and directly helping people which i never get to do in tech in the future i would love to work in either primary care or academic medicine where i get to help teach residents and medical students id love a career where i can work well into my older years not because i need the money but because i love and see purpose in what i do i am well aware that switching to medicine would have its downsides this path is financially a huge opportunity cost for the next decade of my life and medical school and residency are very tough luckily i actually took many of the premedical courses requirements during undergrad and i would need just one and a half semesters to wrap up all the other requirements in a diy postbacc program if i work part time as a researcher during these semesters i could take the courses tuition free if i go to medical school in my home state lcol i estimate that i would be able to pay for over half of the cost of attendance thanks to saving a great deal of my income as well as some lucky investments am i insane for wanting to switch careers is there anything i havent thought through enough any feedback would be greatly appreciated from any medical studentsprofessionals on this sub,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdzF1em1aT0dSV0d2cnFYMWl3WHpqMUJhbUZ6a0hsTXFLcmx3TVhpRHQ3eHZVOG5CVVpXazdLRW80ZGc0SEdnRGxBd1kzejk2SEJvTkRkSE1fRW90ZVE9PQ==

im way late to this convo but hoping some of yall are still active because im trying to figure out whats going on now and im not seeing any of yall talk about the underlying issues causing hypoglycemia here first just sharing my experience i had my first episode <number> years ago i didnt know what it was then but now that its happened to me several times and ive started testing my blood sugar which dips to the ss i know that was the first essentially i just get incredibly confused i cant think straight disoriented and my skin gets numb in some cases ive had trouble seeing as well it happens mostly when im exerting a lot of energy and miss meals which i try to eat every <number> hours nowadays i wake up at about <number><number> blood sugar coke pops me out of the fits now i started going to the doctors to figure this out a year and a half ago i feel like im finally getting somewhere but still no official diagnosis my full blood panel my diabetes test comes back low and my blood sugar usually at <number> which is fasting and at the start of the day so i had a dr just say nothing was wrong with me prior and move me along but the episodes are become more and more and very debilitating so i went to a new dr and she actually had a friend who went through the same thing turns out her friend had a tumor on her pancreas this tumor releases insulin which essentially lowers your blood sugar im going back for a <number> hour test and i think after that a ct scan to look for tumors ive read another thing it could be is hypothyroidism but inevitably hypoglycemia is just a symptom of a root problem is what ive been reading so my question for this group which it seems is experiencing the same episodes as me or connected to someone who is is have you found your root problem have you been tested beyond blood panels have you been advised by your drs on what is causing this ill be honest in that im freaking out removing a tumor on your pancreas is incredibly risky and often makes the patient become diabetic at this point im essentially waiting on tests and drs appts to figure out whats going on and honestly you guys can probably relate in that most drs have no idea what to do with this kind of issue when youre not diabetic so id love to hear anyone elses experiences with drs and if anyone has been diagnosed to anything and been able to fix tha problem and essentially cure their hypoglycemia thanks,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcFN3SU1hRlhTdHFseUZrcE5WeHNDZGM5RmYyVkQtUkR4eWVJcExiVFV4akNHR1RzSWNHb29kWFVYTVlvOFVsVGVVa3piVjdMZ3dMU2JEYklyZXZseW9uekxQTVhCckppMExjMnVFZEpDN0k9

thats a pretty generous interpretation of those two links the first is a single study looking at variations across races with blood glucose monitors and found a <number> difference assuming that is true for all black patients is going too far and i cant find much with a quick pub med to add to it the second is about hemoglobin variants that can affect the way the ac assay is preformed and again cannot be extrapolated to all black patients especially in a pregnant population where you likely have a hemoglobin electrophoresis if you can find me a paper that shows that black patients have better outcomes at higher acs ill be on board but since morbidity related to diabetes in black patients is higher than in other ethic groups this is a lab anomaly that would not have me changing my practice anytime soon,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVFlJWGlLQ0lHN19pSzZFd3NGUUt4elV2U1R5Ui11WUtjcEpDcjU5ZE5Ja1FITHBwRnh2Zmx6UHlwUFZGRXo2S3N1WnVsdU91c0FMYlpvUmtLcGtiWHc9PQ==

fellow hospitalist about <number> years out couple of personal takeaways that i have because the money aspect of everything unfortunately still messes with me at times its like aftershocks from an earthquake meaning it just takes time i have less moments of panic and guilt now than i did a year ago and less than two etc i think everyones timeline is different speaking on everyone being different i unfortunately still compare myself to partners in my group came home and told my husband i didnt think i was going enough in terms of savings and work etc and he said to me comparison is the thief of joy which i know is an infamous quote but it applied i was comparing myself to people in completely different situations and some practicing <number> years longer than me so dont let that stress you out do what you are good at what we are all good at and learn i felt a lot better about financing when i started picking up some books and reading about it i was fortunate and as a med student had an emim tell me about the white coat investor quick and easy read that starts at the beginning of becoming a doctor and walks you though it was written by a doctor so had some great tips but then additionally i just started picking up some more frequently recommended books and i think by having more knowledge it made the whole situation easier going back to having partners in the group i asked questions just like we cherry picked tipstrickstraits through training we can still do it i saw a partner making what i thought was good decisions and something i liked i just asked there is no such thing as a dumb question live like a resident i still will not turn down free stuff i still look for the coupon codes online i still try to maximize and i think thats some of that guilt because i also still have some student loans will be done with my plsf by <number><number> and check back in with my mentality then but i also have learned to let myself enjoy life because thats what i worked so hard for you will slowly notice little things like instead of looking for knock off brand at the store you buy that name brand and dont even compare costs anymore one year out i am sure you are doing great give yourself time and grace,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWFZIdFpVa2JBY1AzbEhEdk1KM1NvdnJReTVmRnhPallscTkxTmllbGlZMzRZeWpHTlRBdk5TZEFtbHk2VDk0NFhqYWtueUxYQ25kUG1IRmsydHdfYmc9PQ==

absolutely agree physicians are used to being high achievers and have always had a next challenge to tackle from high school and college admissions all the way to residency and boards the feeling of finally reaching the pinnacle can feel like a this is it realization the paycheck is nice but it doesnt mean you are automatically happy that the stress melts away that personal baggage disappears and that the work becomes easy its fine but not a magic cure for all the things weve swept under the rug along the way and also why i dont think of medicine as some kind of noble calling the other factor is when we finish in our s is when most peoples life happiness curves start approaching their nadir before rising again so its common for many to feel lost and behind our professional journey just magnifies it having hobbies and purpose outside of medicine really helped me i got into finances as well and reached financial independence before <number> so i could have more time and freedoms to be with family explore hobbies give back etc,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOWUxNndWVTJkcXBWOUJ1bEdSUk4tejBvdjY3eXpadFdKS1VpenVJTURHUFpmWmQ0cVNYcXBxYldqX05FeW1LSy1VbTI0aTZZcXoyYjF1V1EtMDh1VEE9PQ==

im pmr and do a lot of chronic spine pain and work closely with surgeons and pain medicine the problem with pain patients is a combination of patients being unable to implement lifestyle changes and our system not incentivising this type of care as a side note it is also challenging to get long term data on lifestyle interventions in randomized controlled trials especially as it pertains to pain he has some points that are accurate but some things are a little too simple and appeal to layman more than other professionals an ideal setup for spine patients would be see me first to help triage the severity of the problem work with pmr and pt combining specific exercise lifestyle medicine what he describes as diet gen exercise sleep stress management social connectionmental health substance use and psychological pain therapy if problem is severe enough that spine isnt stable or nerve damage is bad then see a surgeon if problem isnt that severe or patient needs an extra push do pain injections to give them a boost the problem with this is many patients will not implement the suggestions i have seriously for a multitude of reasons many people see private surgeons first and get surgeries done quickly making it harder to treat conservatively effectively many people are screwed by other parts of their life work insurance etc and cant address their problems appropriately the medical system doesnt have the best incentives to accomplish the ideal setup in my view but patients also do not have the best resources or motivation to do this its unfortunately a double whammy i think most non surgeons try to do lifestyle interventions and have too many patients that cant do those things it gets frustrating over time and you end up recommending things that are short term effective because you see so many people unable to make the lifestyle changes that will help them long term im glad he figured this out but its not revolutionary nearly all of us in physiatry pain medicine and other conservative fields understand this many surgeons also understand this but they can only do so much chronic pain patients are very challenging and unfortunately many of us have to start limiting them in our practices because they take so much effort and dont implement the changes we want them to make there needs to be a change to insurance and incentives to prioritize conservative care and give patients the resources they need im not sure how we did the patient motivation end of things but unfortunately that is likely more a byproduct of our society and not the medical system,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTmpyVm8zdFh3LTdhRG5ZLW5YSUZBSS1XVFhib1Fwd3BEMC1rM3dvN2xTS3Bmd201d2NKYV9BZnlHRk9MQXVLRFMtVS1aNTRIanpSNHdzeXJJNFZOMkE9PQ==

it is always interesting how different the program requirments are for similar majors at other schools i get why it gets passed over at times but both in engineering and medicine it is problematic to not have that foundation it has implications beyond just if you want to do a study or design an experiment it is through research and statistics training that people learn things like how much type <number> and <number> errors can vary depending on test factors what confounding variables to look out for when testing patients and what to do about them new protocols that are put out are based on research studies and being able to go back to those studies is important to understanding when those protocols apply and their limitations unfortunately this information isnt always packaged up nicely for clinicians hopefully statistics and research eduction requirements will change in the future i have no doubt that you went to good schools and honestly the engineer to med school path is tough so mad respect for doing that,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZEdZTU5NaURpbVhzaWZNd09zdlI5SW5LVnMzdGNNVlB2RnpFX21zZm5Pb01BWDg1SDR1YjE1bGViTnRTeXgtTW9VMFNZVU94VU5GTXd0Xy1kOW1qU3FMaXY3Z214eUJTWks5eWs5QkhFem89

as a clinical analyst who specializes in surgery and surgical clinics and has boots in the ground in surgery while some neurosurgical pts obviously need surgery for intractable pain we all know other pts seen by neurosurgeons have serious behavioral issues that affect more than just an unhealthy lifestyle some are seekers and some are difficult to assess and handle due to altered brain chemistry from chronic narc usepain pumps this is stressor <number> to the suitsstessor <number> from inception admin begins their neurosurgical romance pitching unrealistic expectations and overly relates benefitspay and surgical support when initially wooing the surgeon ive watched this repeatedly but admins goal is always to maintain their surgical specialties rounded out to keep more pts and revenue within their own system and to maintain their trauma level and will say pretty much anything to get a doc this is the same with any surgeon but when the neurosurgeon gets their block and starts cutting its always the same admin begins to make noise registering their shock about the costs of spine systems allografts etc and they try to compare them to total joint systems they register concerns about the clinic visitsrevenue related to surgeries unrealistically comparing neurosurgery blockssurgeries per month vs ortho bros and ramp up the pressure then without notice advise that supply chain will no longer allow the surgeon to order specific spine systems before a scheduled surgery or graft anymore because supply chain has sourced lowercost spine screws from x supplier cages from another allografts fillers putty from others as well except spine doesnt work that way so with very little notice the surgical schedule gets blown to crap because we have no purchase power for the pts spinal systems for their surgeries cancellations and delays begin and then the periop director and surgeon come to me for a detailed analysis tailored to fight corp off and this happens every time a new suit comes into the system whether its a new person in finance supply chain or higher up its maddening combine all the above and sometimes the repetitive pressure breaks surgeons like dr goobie who had mixed ambitions that were likely already compromised from inception i do think hes myopically focused on the healthy lifestyle cause but overall his frank disenchantment and depression is logical and justified to me also hes the one who really needed the healthy lifestyle i feel for the guy and i truly hope he eventually finds his nirvana in a completely different specialty or profession and blessings to his wife for standing by him cant be easy,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacEppdFlOZlRSQWVCWE1TdFFBQ3JPblkxamlQTUcwTF9KWFFQdGxNRVJ2RU5QX0F4Mk1WVjdlNUtxS3Z5VFphTVB0M3VuWm85Q2hWa0l6N1kxbnhfUEROZVhDX2g1SzhDdF9QNGdnWGpFSUU9

yep i totally agree with that clinicians dont need to be researchers or statisticians they just need to understand enough of it to know where the tests and protocols they are using come from and their limitations part of my training was related to ethnographic research where people are observed in their environment as you can imagine hospitals are a common venue for that since it is an easy place to study people under varying levels of stress and how they make decisions interact with technology i often felt like a little more statistics and or research training would improve patient outcomes but idk i didnt formally look at it,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadlpKdXYwOXd5NVlzOEdxMnA1ZWpxajRSV3oxcERfWTgxUUNYOV8xTnZIRkRaRTFEYXYyUDk0UzEwZjl2VEZmWm9ZS3lCUkFkcTZudm1aZ1ZtNVZyMDR2UVV0MVMtcUpvcE1JckxRelFxMVE9
the mosquitos look like they enjoyed this so lets get this straight i became a doctor to help people and your job as a doctor is to relieve suffering he wanted to learn about consciousness and connecting brains to computers and cybernetics he trained and learned about spine surgery as well sounds like he didnt exactly love this part of his training turns out the dream of cybernetics is challenged by the bodys immune response to the electrodes which he perceived as an insurmountable obstacle to his research dream talks about how much timesacrifice it took to become a surgeon realized at <number> where i wanted to go was not possible and becomes disillusioned with his passion leans into spine which he doesnt like gets paid well but doesnt like his job i didnt know what the problem was but now i know what it is in spite of wanting to help people there were way more people that i couldnt help because of lifestyleagedegenerative disease describes the spinal procedures as removing things such as bulging discs or removing motion through fusion with the exception of the only thing i added were these little electrodes to block pain signals what i realized later on is those arent fixing the problem surgery caused improvement but didnt address the cause of morbidity this is frustrating to watch this guy is clearly bright but smacks of absolutely zero introspection zero wisdom it also screams hubris look im sure he is a well intentioned guy and all but holy shit what kind of inflated sense of self worth must you have to think that you can somehow singlehandedly solve the problem of age and lifestylerelated spine disease that or naivete its a good lesson that even the brightest most successful minds out there can still be goddamned fools my primary patient population is children who require ventilators to survive these children have been afflicted by terrible conditions prematurity resulting in profoundly immature lungs neurodegenerative diseases ischemic insults to the brain severe enough to rob them of their ability to breathe independently sometimes due to abuse or trauma or other tragedy we live amongst the tragedy as physicians we work in spite of it my patient with cystic fibrosis needing a lung transplant is looking at a severely reduced lifespan my patient with a progressive fibrosing mediastinitis refractory to therapy is going to inevitably die choked from the inside out i cant change the underlying reality of their diseases i cant change the root cause of what they are going through i dont even have the luxury of being able to blame years of poor lifestyle though i know that it wouldnt serve to help me cope any better but each day i meet with these families i have an opportunity to do something even if its just walking beside them in their suffering its a goddamned honor that im invited into the room to help a mother decide when its time for compassionate extubation and organ donation to be entrusted with that knowledge and try and deliver it as compassionately lovingly and carefully as possible did he completely miss the point of his professors wisdom because he cant seem to solve one problem look i get medicine is a goddamned mess insurance companies medical device manufacturers hospitals hell <number> of the expense burden are literal administrative leeches sucking a paycheck out of the system while contributing nothing to the bedside this is disillusioning but is the solution really to fuck off to the woods and retire early honestly a week of really intensive therapy could have offered this man a great deal of relief or reading the wisdom of our forbears or even finding some philosophical framework religion works stoicism existentialism to help cope with the shit we all deal with and still get up to help patients what a waste of thousands and thousands of hours of training it makes me want to thank my pcp im not the best patient but the things hes doing are literally saving my life even though they arent as dramatic as cybernetic limbs this guy pisses me off uktn says it best ok bye gotta go see my next patient,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTTRrdWpvNm5oSEdCNHg5V2dDZVRIYXQ2T0J6ODZUZVBmcWxIanVBeG9KZTlZdlFpcHR5WVpDengyNzQ0aU14blBQbldOM2w0WXVXRzd2amxsZ2picFE9PQ==

i watched the whole thing the other night it almost sounds like he came to doubt the utility of his interventions to such a degree that it stole his motivation but he also sounds like he pursued neurosurgery with sort of a pipe dream in terms of the brainmachine interface maybe he was more of an academic or researchfocused person who didnt find clinical work satisfying when that didnt pan out i dont think its any secret that the chronic diseases associated with modern lifestyles and the various comorbidities they result in are not problems that modern medicine can really solve and are kind of a drag to manage over the long term i think most people however can find satisfaction in the less frequent problem that we do solve or that does have true positive impact on a patient neurosurgery is so cloistered and unfamiliar to me that its hard for me to know if their outcomes really are inconsistent enough to make his perspective seem valid if hes just so much of a perfectionist that he couldnt be satisfied by work with the occasional imperfect outcome then he really doesnt belong in healthcare and i think something else will bring him more peace of mind it is also likely possible to practice neurosurgery for a few years and save up enough to retire early with a modest lifestyle i dont think it will be possible to go back however if he takes any substantial time off and im not sure neurosurgical training prepared him to use his medical degree in many other ways time will tell if the financial impacts of the decision cause hardship in the long run,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTE9kMlE1U2RXbW4zcXZTOV9tVWMxZy05WVBxV1l3RGV6Y2g4cDd4Wk9qMWR5SFNlWTNIaEJ3UEdYakRuUFZ2OXJRYzlyOTlwX2lDRDdaLUVOUUc5OVBJcFcySk1RSmN2N1g4QzNoOElYUWM9

the spirit of neurosurgery is in charge does not hold if there is another personteam that is primarily responsible many hospitals will not have surgical specialists be primary this is because they are often busy in the or and may or may not be equipped to deal with whole body physiology so if there is another service managing probably any of the ccm sub specialties they are also in chargeresponsible if not more so they are meeting with families dealing with all do the bedside issues and working to produce the best outcomes regardless of organ system not that nsgy doesnt meet families they are just often less available due to or needs additionally many traumatic head bleeds are non operative so ultimately medical management is run by ccm,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZzRxYzZpT2xoNkN1dFBYbkpKVzVrMGppdTZCWTZ2VTRpOUsxT3V3TDdkVzFWZU1UejRQMVYwaTJmTkx1SmJ1bW1CT1lqSk1LUGExZ3poTERqS1k5Z3c9PQ==

straight from cms emphasis mine >in order to bill medicare for two overlapping surgeries the teaching surgeon must be present during the critical or key portions of both operations therefore the critical or key portions may not take place at the same time when all of the key portions of the initial procedure have been completed the teaching surgeon may begin to become involved in a second procedure the teaching surgeon must personally document in the medical record that heshe was physically present during the critical or key portions of both procedures when a teaching physician is not present during noncritical or nonkey portions of the procedure and is participating in another surgical procedure heshe must arrange for another qualified surgeon to immediately assist the resident in the other case should the need arise the article mentions that they were running simultaneous rooms without designating a backup which is against regulations regarding keycritical portions the authors specifically mention that they were missing timeouts which is already a big deal given the general sense you get from the rest of the vague details in the article i can easily imagine that they may have been missing other critical portions of procedures at least some of the time >in the case of three concurrent surgical procedures the role of the teaching surgeon but not anesthesiologist in each of the cases is classified as a supervisory service to the hospital rather than a physician service to an individual patient and is not payable under the physician fee schedule its mentioned in the article that they were sometimes running three rooms i imagine they were billing for those too and if so that is unequivocally fraudulent,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRDBFaGVsLTg2X0RhUFpkdkF6ZVpHdVpUVVUxdTNKVXpjanJPUExsTFRRMmU4blhtR0Vib0JFRnR2SDltVWdmTHgxV1RrVmxQR0xVTlhtM0pybDlTQ1E9PQ==

theres no clear cut way to expect elevated icps in such an emergent setting if you suspect the patient has a severe head injury any sort of space occupying lesionblood with a poor neurological examination they probably have some element of icp elevation the clear cut findings are if they are unresponsive with a blown pupil which also means they have herniated btg guidelines suggest sustained icps > <number><number> are detrimental hard to say at what icp people start herniating since it is individualized some places just have protocols in place for sbp control which isnt really evidencebased but is probably not unreasonable keeping sbp < <number> in an undifferentiated neurological emergency especially trauma related until you get imaging is probably not unreasonable there is a difference in perfusion that happens when sbp is <number> vs sbp of <number> maintaining a reasonable map is probably the best you can do ultimately while we harp on bp control if someone has a big subdural or epidural or trauma related parenchymal hemorrhage the definitive lifesaving measure is surgical decompression of some sort evd crani etc long story short from a prehospital standpoint just aim for a reasonable bp and get the patient to the trauma center asap,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVTViNXpUSDg1TEVqRWdyQU1aMG9yRFYzZ0cxajc2dWw5d2V6RUUwdThCa1V3UVJHVS1iQTZxVHRPOUotZW9GNG03V0hfMzkzWTFibFVUNENERjMxUFE9PQ==

yes i understand the principles of human geography and demographic transition however particularly in the united states there are factors at play that havent been studied on large population levels yet this is the first generation that is worse off than prior in general women becoming more educated and autonomous with their choices leads to fewer children than prior especially as medical care improves and infant mortality decreases but the first world is entering new territory that hasnt been seen before where huge segments of the population are chosing to have no children at all this is unprecedented in the history of reproduction and is not just correlated with wealth,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWDBZdmdMZWZ4WGJJU1N2eG1oeFh0QzNiZVUzR2x0RHg2TkFZMkFXNkxWRmlJWk43dHhFTkFvYjQxbWZIcGp3bmVjTWRST0tXNzRRNG91Y2RoNkFySlE9PQ==

so shes taking mg of hydrocodone per day not an insane amount but decent amount some of the concern is pain control afterwards patients have higher narcotic requirements and this can make it difficult to accurately prescribe meds so that pain is tolerable my thought is that there is concern regarding respiratory depression also maybe the surgeon wants the patient off meds so that they have response to a typical post op pain regimen and dont get called afterward for more meds however these patients can be good candidates for regional anesthesia and things such as methadone andor ketamine to help with postop pain,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZWxYdjNrZ0ZQSXdIUjBEWUE5Y183c2U1WEZGNnBIal94T0ZJdk9fSElfYkRWM3dmNFVRdmxScUdNVkRhdEs2clM4T2hpR3VYVmRackZpaVgzUVdnVmc9PQ==

many of my colleagues believe that no amount of arthritic pain is enough to require opiates that amount of opiate for knee arthritis is just simply too high for any individual opiates have not been shown to be effective for this indication if this person has surgery on preop short acting opiate at that level they not tolerate it well at all even with a multimodal regimen these patients are usually people who expect a <number> pain level at all times which makes it more difficult essentially this is a person who is addicted to short acting opiates which makes them a terrible candidate for a painful elective surgery instead of telling the patient the appropriate thing which is i dont feel safe operating on you while you have an opiate addiction he challenges the patient to stop and prove that they can remain opiate free this is the most charitable explanation the reality is that for someone who is busy and does elective surgery they can just say no to patients who arent worth the time and effort this is a patient who is very likely to have a bad experience with this operation who has a high risk of postoperative opiate dependency and poor pain tolerance for many of these patients every visit is a negotiation on the number of pills they need many pain management folks and pcps wont prescribe postoperative either the ever shrinking amount that gets paid for a total joint is just not worth it for some people if the patient ods everyone points to the surgeon and they will <number> get named in the suit that risk is just not worth it to some if they are in a bundle then they are at risk to use emergency services and rehab which will come directly out of the surgeons pocket this is a major problem with alternative payment models like bundle payments they exclude patients from elective operations that they would otherwise be candidates for maybe they just dont like them or just generally dont hate taking care of patients on chronic opiates i dont know the guy ultimately if the patient wants surgery they should just find someone else theres no shortage of surgeons who do arthroplasty at least not yet,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZ3doTDVoM1lSWEJqM2ttclc4MUk5SXA5b3VZZEdyMUNMdlpoVkx2b3VzblE3MnllRWt1ZndhZlpiNGowRDF3Y3FkaU5uQUVoQzI2WXBzbWZOelQ4M3c9PQ==

i watched the entirety of his video with my newfound copious free time the other day and was very curious what others in medicine and specifically nsgy thought personally i thought despite his valid points overall he seemed quite burnt out his apathy toward the value of his day to day work is a classic burnout symptom this kind of stuff comes up on every years acgme survey not to say he is wrong to want a different life or that addressing disease at a risk factor level is wrong either it just seems he lost sight of or became disinterested in the niche sector of health that neurosurgeons like him deal with,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaXRwaFl5VU5jaGdmelYwNi02RWdaQ3RMRkN5TlU5OFB3U1lDWXdVNkJlOHZ2cmdGOURJMmpvSk8zSDk3blJSYUJ4ZnRvVlNQZnVtYnVrMk4zWC1DX3c9PQ==

ultimately all patients on chronic opiates have a higher risk of complications after arthroplasty obviously i know the difference between dependence and addiction but even in patients who are dependent exposing them to higher doses of opiates then rapidly tapering those doses which can spur addiction the article is one is a significant body of literature on the topic <url><url> a quote from the article our results indicate that the shortterm use of opioids eg to deal with an acute pain crisis from arthritis will not increase the risk for future surgical complications whereas continued use significantly increases this risk furthermore it also suggests that once a patient requires the use of opioids to manage an acute crisis of arthritic pain that they would benefit from surgical consultation if only to discuss the option of surgery finally these results also suggest that a harm reduction strategyie encouraging cessation or perhaps even a reduction of opioid use to intermittent levels should be attempted prior to surgery however this will require further study,r/medicine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncVloeHVVcVNQcUdSQ2M5bGRCdVcxLXVEQ3FYRVQ2bGJaT2YwaW5tYVp0RFFsZXJoUGdzNEQteXVaMzFGTG1PVHJ6T1g1Z2RfaE5ycTU5d3VnTi1NRWc9PQ==
