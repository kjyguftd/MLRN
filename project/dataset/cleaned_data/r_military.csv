to answer your title yes it is possible to join directly as an officer to clarify your remarks about what youre cousin told you e<number> is an enlisted rank officer ranks all start with o i believe your cousin was referring to the fact that you would most likely receive e<number> pay while at officer candidate school or your chosen branchs equivalent once you complete said school you receive a commission as an o<number> on active duty either a second lieutenant or an ensign again depending on branch this may differ if you decide to join the medical corps i believe they base your rank on your specialty and your experience but if youre just starting out i imagine theyd still start you at a relatively low officer rank they may or may not care about what degree you have depending on which career path you want to take there are several options where your degree does not matter though your gpa from getting that degree still plays a large role naval aviation is such an example many pilots and flight officers have degrees completely unrelated to their career jokingly referred to as degrees in underwater basket weaving for that pipeline they evaluate your gpa and astbe performance instead of your degree choice there are other requirements involved however such as minimum age what your cousin told you is mostly true but while i cant speak to all branches or professions a common theme ive seen is that while the pay is good its usually better in the civilian field for the equivalent job more so than the tax benefits can account for you can also usually expect to move every couple of years with some exceptions dualmil couple or a dependant that requires exceptional medical care and depending on your branch and career path you may also expect regular deploymentsdetachments from your home station including increased working hours for a relatively small bump in pay its hard to speak to all the downsides because theyre all going to be different based on which branch you pick and which career path within that branch but remember if it sounds too good to be true it usually is,r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT25vMGtpVExDU1Z4X3oyZUVUN1c0aDlSSXBtTEJfVFhkRWxfdTN5OWJqZnQydnY4X2QxRkJGNHZrMVhTNTdGVG9SV0k4aGN0emRNRmFoeENNWlZiWEE9PQ==

they do nothing of tangible value suicide preventionawareness training is not meant to stop people from killing themselves but rather to make people aware of some of the signs that someone is going to kill themselves and how to interrupt the behavior andor inform the right people who are more equipped to intervene the effect of this is that leadership command level through to the secdef is delegating preventing suicides to the bottom rung of the ladder so that when suicide rates dont go down it isnt the dods fault its the fault of the victims friends and colleagues who didnt do the job that was assigned to them i have legit seen a cpo yell at and berate their division for not stopping one of their own from killing themself the dod as an institution only cares as much about troop suicide as much as it cares about troop pregnancy or injury its just another gapped billet that they need to fill it cares about veteran suicide even less this isnt to say individual people in the dod dont care they certainly do but in an org as large as the dod individual feeling and attitudes are lost in the noise,r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhd0pDTU9iUFdJb2hiOFR0a3NvNzhyRzJZVy1JRnYtUkphVGJ6RU14LTR4aEtSUDZsV3FKV3JoZExsOVR3dlp4YTZlbDhXV2Zhal96T016Y0s3OHNYdDVRQ0RwUk1hUDBIeE5xanF5U2RsWnc9

yes if you have a college degree you meet the minimum requirement to apply for an officer program be advised applying for officer isnt anywhere near as quick as enlisting even if youre accepted expect an <number><number> month process from the first interview to shipping to ocs for air force its closer to two years and af heavily favors stem degrees and high gpas other branches are relatively more accepting of other majors and slightly lower gpas my suggestion would be that you read up on officer programs for several branches and make appointments to meet with recruiters note for army and coast guard the same office does enlistment and commissioning however for navy marines air force they have totally separate officer recruiters and there is zero utility to meeting with an enlistment recruiter if your goal is to commission note too army is unique in that you have to enlist to commission and go to enlisted basic training prior to being given your shot at ocs or as noted above you could enlist which is far quicker and easier and gives you direct control over what job you get and with a college degree youd come in at a higher enlisted rank,r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnT1BNS1JsY3VERkJNcE14Uk93NFhWWkMwSENiUThTM2h4c2toN05mZ0podkRYZkVhNEt0bE5iaURtRDVMS1BWMVpLNHBDWm5zMVVmeFo3NUtvM3BGWkhfV3BsRVQyQlAyazk4aml1V21FbGs9

which involves both money and reelection ask yourself why has cutting spending on veterans always been so unpopular if it was only veterans representing themselves at the polls then wed pretty much have nothing its overwhelmingly a matter of public opinion across many different voting brackets given that over the past couple of years its become clear that its stupidly easy and cheap to sway a given person on a subject by simply just gaslighting them with an overwhelming majority of false information rather than clear factual arguments i dont see it as completely out of the realm of possibility that veterans benefits will be attacked one day with public backing it may not and probably wont happen if trump wins but itd potentially be a green light to push the envelope further given him and his partys association with the heritage foundation admittedly the gutting of va benefits falls under a large umbrella of terrible shit project <number> proposes and pretty much everything i just said could apply to those things but think about who may benefit from va benefits being cut with public support which im admittedly still soso on if that bar could really be reached but itd be a win for politicians given that we dont hold a large voting majority and its a spending cut and itd be a win for both public and private entities that want that funding as well actually pretty much everyone except us wins from this its a social benefit with no recourse for the government i mean hell look at what politicians the heritage foundation is associated with theyre the same one that currently run on increasing va benefits why the hell would they be associated with this interest group at all its a huge red flag to put it simply fight like hell to make it clear that these kinds of proposals are unacceptable to you,r/military,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSEJnZzlTeXNSS25hZldIa3h5V29nd1ZONGpiMWNaa2huS1lWMEFOYXpISXllU3lqSDVXb0RrbjN4M214NTlTSUNUMVh2ZUZUcHNQMy1nUzRCNERoS2c9PQ==
