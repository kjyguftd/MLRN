europeans and asians have never understood americans or how things work in the us they come from deep histories of warring empires living under monarchies and autocracies who used the citizenries as conscripted soldiers and support personnel by force the us is the first country to have true freedom for its citizens in the world we are the first country to promote individualism instead of just being forced to be part of the collective they believed americans were hedonists because of our individualism and desire to stay neutral during the world wars instead of just blindly joining the war like they all did europeans and asians have always fought using brute force tactics in open warfare and werent prepared for the level of tactical intelligence america uses they have always believed traditional combat could overwhelm the american military and we would just give up like they do they never took into account just how smart americans are combined with how brutal we can be when we want to be america has always been looked down upon by europeans because of some sort of strange ignorant elitism simply because they have been around longer its their way of not having to come to terms with the fact the youngest kid in the family became the patriarch of the family as a toddler they hate the fact that america beat every major european power in combat and now they have to ask us for help every time they get into it with each other the prussiansgermans especially wrote us off because they had been the biggest warrior culture in europe since the fall of rome that they just couldnt understand how such a young country full of free individuals could willingly come together to create the most powerful country in the history of the world,r/militaryhistory,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXblkyTnlPLWZLTzNSbVgtUWtQbFFVbHcwcGVqQkNXMjVyYm5SYkJaNlVkU0thSVRoa1pWUlpWbGpqaGVhN3dNYWUzQ0NaZXQwQ1BieXVDQzh2bGM0V2c9PQ==

>is the united states a democracy or a republic this is one of those eitheror questions that seems like it should have a straightforward answer after all two such different words must have two different definitions right >the short answer is that democracy and republic are frequently used to mean the same thing a government in which the people vote for their leaders this was the important distinction at the time of the founding of the united states in direct contrast with the rule of a king or monarchy in great britain in part because that context was clear to everyone involved in the american revolution these terms were used interchangeably in the late s both democracy and republic meant that the power to govern was held by the people rather than a monarch >at the same time its true that there is nuance and difference between these words according to their historical use and etymology democracy comes from the greek roots meaning rule by the people and the most basic understanding of the words original meaning refers to the direct democracy of ancient greece >republic comes from the latin roots meaning public good or public affair used in ancient rome to mean simply state or country with reference to the representative democracy of the roman republic the elected representatives in congress are a contemporary example of this kind of government >because democracy is an abstract name for a system and republic is the more concrete result of that system democracy is frequently used when the emphasis is on the system itself we could say that democracy is to republic as monarchy is to kingdom >these terms are not mentioned in the declaration of independence a document that nevertheless expresses clearly that governments should be established deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed this reads like a definition of both democracy and republic in article iv section iv of the constitution the term republican is used as an adjective the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government >in the final analysis what these words share in meaning is much more important than how they differ <url> >you probably hear countries like the united states or france referred to as democracies at the same time you probably also hear both of these countries called republics is that possible are democracies and republics the same thing or different >we dont blame you for confusing these two terms with a major and heated us election underway its the perfect time for some government <number> lets brush up on these two words to see what they have in commonand what sets them apart >what does democracy mean >a democracy is defined as government by the people a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system a nation with this form of government is also referred to as a democracy >a democracy is achieved by conducting free elections in which eligible people <number> vote on issues directly known as a direct democracy or <number> elect representatives to handle the issues for them called a representative democracy >the word democracy dates back in english to around <number> it comes from the greek demokratia meaning popular government ancient greece was home to what most consider to be the oldest form of democracy the citystate of athens in athens the people greek demos held the power greek kratos and made the decisions for their societyforming a demokratia >but its essential to note the people who are able to vote in athens only included certain nonenslaved athenian men making this direct democracy very different from the way we understand democracy today >what is a direct democracy for example if a town only had enough funding to repair either their sewer system or roads it might ask the citizens to vote on which one should get the money its members would vote on their preference and the towns government would follow the will of the people and go with their choice this is a basic example of direct democracy >many referendums are voted on this way such as the scottish independence from the united kingdom referendum in <number> and the united kingdom european union membership referendum popularly referred to as brexit in <number> >what is a representative democracy >in contrast to a direct democracy the people in a representative democracy elect representatives who act then on behalf of them known as their constituents many of the worlds parliaments and the uss congress are an example of representative democracies >today it is inefficient if not impossible to have every eligible citizen vote on every issueto vote on every piece of legislation that it takes to run a city a state a country instead citizens vote for leaders to do the work of governing for them >lets revisit our municipal sewerroad matter a representative democracy would not have each and every citizen of a town directly vote on whether to fund a sewer system or road repairs instead the citizens would elect a mayor and city council to handle these issues in their place the elected officials would then vote on where city funding should go doing their best to reflect and respect the needs of the people who voted for them >what does republic mean >a republic is defined as a state in which the supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen directly or indirectly by them sound familiar it should >you see many of todays democracies are also republics and are even referred to as democratic republics so the us and france are considered both democracies and republicsboth terms point to the fact that the power of governance rests in the people and the exercise of that power is done through some sort of electoral representation >the key concept to the word republic is that the leader of this government or state is not a hereditary monarch but a president whether they are elected or installed >this core idea helps explain in part why autocratic governments like north korea is officially called the democratic peoples republic of korea its citizens vote or vote on a single candidate a historical example of a republic is also instructive the republic of venice a mercantile citystate of the middle ages was led by a doge who was elected by wealthy merchants and served until his death neither of these governments would be considered a democracy >the word republic is first recorded in english <number> it comes from the latin res publica meaning public thing characterizing that a state is ultimately run by its peopleas opposed to monarchy or tyranny for nearly <number> years ancient rome was a republic before it became ruled by emperors <url> >republic form of government in which a state is ruled by representatives of the citizen body modern republics are founded on the idea that sovereignty rests with the people though who is included and excluded from the category of the people has varied across history because citizens do not govern the state themselves but through representatives republics may be distinguished from direct democracy though modern representative democracies are by and large republics the term republic may also be applied to any form of government in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch <url> here you go pure dictionary and encyclopedic definitions all these are academically accepted since they were vaild sources for
