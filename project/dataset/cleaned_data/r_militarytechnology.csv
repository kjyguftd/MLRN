i like that an answer to your question a lot of the time they have a type of honeycomb traingle structures made of rigid rubber inside the wheel thank you for being the first person to ever post here too you have earned the tag og congrats,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSUEVnTnZXUEpPNDJ4dmR5anlYMHBDS2dES0tMQmxwaW94U2I4a3BiRXIzTjVVd2JwWXFSVnE4R2pBNlZ2WW9aRmZLN0dhb0g2MHFJakZncm93YmVGV1E9PQ==
then i assume it is more rational by properties balance than fullsolid wheels i was thinking a filledfullsolid wheel would be the best but nothing confirms this to be the case but i feel like such wheels wouldnt be the best choice for durability after damage because they need to withstand highvelocity force redistribution and light jumps for <number>+ minutes including a possible cost factor can you mention any specific vehicles which use them a guy on canadian forum also said they use runflats rd option some article says that m stryker uses runflats and press publications say matv uses runflat system but idk if they mean the same or just a capability,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSeV9TUXZSZTdnSi1BLVd1ekplMm1JelFfMmxEZVlSa1MtX1QyRzVfSUlVU3Zod2lDWEx2WVMwTHB5am45dWViSDh1Ty1tcHF2NkJNLWxvY0NlS0NGamc9PQ==

ir missles lock on to a heat source that heat source is bounced off programs that they have trained so we can try key word try to not have a false positive on a flare radar guided missiles which only a few countries have lock on to the shape size of the plane as it approaches just like that new bomber was unveiled its stealth to low freq radar and what the world switched to high freq current stealth only does one that thing could drop bombs on moscow and no one would see it coming its a first strike weapon pure and simple current sensors on planes to detect incoming missles have been trained to detect optically now if its real or not we used to use uv based sensors when a missile is going through the sky it gives off alot of uv light but the problem is runaways also give off alot and in the past has resulted in counter measures going off,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSeDFfQWY4RXJkZ013aklNNkpIVm0wRUV0cVV5T0FzeU5VOEZkRjJvdm91QnloV0VvWUFON2hnYThfeGE1OGJUdVE2MlFCY29mTm9fN2s5UnhuT19YQlE9PQ==
none of these things you described are image recognition software which would be able to define the new stealth bomber silhouette from the sky surrounding it unless it has science fiction levels of cloaking technology making it completely translucent the new bomber being touted as viable in modern conflicts was the exact reason i made this post btw because while i can fathom how a stealth bomber might make it over moscow as a first strike vehicle as you said in your example i cant imagine that theyd make it out alive once they gave away their position image recognition in missiles seems like a surefire way to bring it down,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSaW9fZWNyaWFRZjFwU00yU1FkQ2xnM3R3c3BRVkdHWGdaYlpsRWE2R1p0SkU4YUw2WF8tcVZSbkZuMTZma041SVhIRV8yUGd0eXA3WW5mc1YySU8tZElGaXRUazlacWYzS1FtLXF5STVZT2M9

so there not viable because of technology those guns simply cant reach inside the shoreline far enough and it requires close in quarters for ship to ship usas whole concept is to strike you so far away you never see us much can be gained by looking at a aircrafts or ships design take the chinese j cockpit the canopy is huge china built a regional dogfighter take our f the pilot cant see behind him well he can with his special helmet but for usa were taking your ass out dozens of miles away like <number><number> with amraam missles next gen is on the horizon even further look at a ramp assist carrier vs catapult everything you need to know about a countries intent on a carrier is from that ramp assist means on average <number> less fuel less fuel less range usa uses catapult systems for maximum loads and fuel we have no interest in <number> century of you bringing the fight to us well hit you before you even know whats coming but to make them viable they would have to have a rail gun problem with rail guns is when there fired there is a immense plasma burst that happens the cannon itself only lasts <number><number> shots the problem is the coating inside we have not invented one that allows continious firing of a rail cannon makes that idea pretty unviable unless its ground based you would be better off building a ship that can hold like <number> cruise missiles the other question is why would you want this sec of defense gates under bush and obama greatly questioned the marine corps future aav plans chinas surface to sea missiles are greater then the launching range of the new aavs how would a amphibious assault over come that in a machine that is not uparmored going slow with no counter measures,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSZ0lWYkhlQVpueTBpbzgwSy01ZFYyejNrbExEanZ3MTFnZ0F2RnRSeGVTRWJ1Nmp6OXdMcGhPOWJfbGEwZUduQ3E2dGxQZThocm82X21KMThhZUZwSHc9PQ==

how would it make it as a first strike well if northrup is correct that its invisible to all forms of radar you simply fly over it and drop your payload and your out before it even hits the ground true warfare if its unlimited there is no need for precision per say your goal is to kill the enemy and break his things its like usa if china really wanted to make usa suffer they would simply cut off the medications <number> or something of our antibiotics come from them so do most of our chemotherapy meds you can thank your politicians for allowing that to happen cut us off for a month and a good portion of usa would simply die off from lack of treatments,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSVExhSWVzTVpFV0FOY0VxQUJnMmhaeGR5ak5ZeVJaQ2Y0TDQ5VVFwV2ZpSGN3ZkJibUtHT3FYTlVrSVMwY2RENEhtcHUwTHdfWXVpZ01GY016RGRBLWc9PQ==

my followup to this point is that image recognition can alert but doesnt give you any telemetry data to make a firing solution based off of the above commenter mentioned how former sensors used uv to alert for incoming missiles the same could be said for incoming stealth bombers if you had a good enough optical sensor with a wide aperture but you cant tell how fast an object is moving using only optical sensors unless you have a frame of reference and in the sky there is none nor can you predict its vector in theory the most realistic solution would to have a laser with a wide beam illuminate a target to provide guidance data after an optical sensor detects but there is no benefit to this system over just sending an interceptor up to fight,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMk4ybU16eGhIS25CNWtRd3BiZXNQblJ4aU1QeG5WTU54Zm5pZURGcTdGRkg2d216VzFDUE9GaGQ5ZnNsdFhjUzZ4cGwydXBsLTdHUm5WUDJnQWp6VVE9PQ==
really no need the problem is a actual gun that fires traditionally has a very limited range take usmc putting himars chained to the deck of their carriers that has more destructive ability and a range well over <number> miles it makes all the guns of all the battleships ever made look stupid technology has made them obsolete so movies etc like to show rail guns its like fusion always <number> years away the problem is the very act of using a rail gun destroys your barrel the plasma created is over <number> degrees i think and they have yet to find a material to stand up to that abuse so you get half a dozen shots out of your gun and something that weighs in the tons has to be replaced no sailor will be doing that a few years ago the navy had a concept of a arsenal ship a ship outfitted with dozens of cruise missile silos much better alternative to a battleship also bear in mind as well that the whole idea of usa forces is we strike from far go back home to reload and you never encounter usthats in a traditional war usa does not like extended conflicts we desire to hammer you into oblivion with superior weapons and call it a day,r/militarytechnology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSREYyNnpsaUdnVVBlbWZ0RFRoUzdiQk9mR0k2aWZ5ek5sQnQ3VlZNOWwtSmxaekxNMXlLSDRUd2xmN3BDQXYtMTl2cVJKNkZwb2IwdS1sN2V3Q2szQkE9PQ==
