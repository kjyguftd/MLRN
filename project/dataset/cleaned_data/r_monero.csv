getting it out into cash creates a situation where you can be fucjed tax wise and kycd stabling it up into dai or stablevoin makes it to where you can easily get back into it without the tax man raping you or what i like to do is put about a third of my income into stables and invest all the rest for spending i always use monero if its accepted but unfortunately my electric company doesnt take monero or property or bonds or any of that they take usd though so while my investments in crypto may have dropped or increased percentages in a week that stable coin did not and i can use that to sell into fiat and pay the bill may have been fucked if something wild happened like say binance got taken over by feds and delisted my coin and all of my net worth dropped by <number>,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMk1DZXhENmpXMG1YWXNqR0ZWamNUQXVETG1uX3ZTYVF3ZWNrbEtZZjF3QXdSN0swaDJfYWlGMU10RG8xVG85VEdOYmM2VFhGMWV0bnQ1STZ4NkZqanc9PQ==

no in your analogy it would be more like telling people in a peaceful country they should go to war and get comfortable with it they are in peace stable and youre telling them to go to war volatile obviously nobody is going to want to do that unless you provide a meaningful reason a path to get there etc you cant just wish people will want to go to war without any other fact involved,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTckV6S0lWN3JNek1QSmY4NTB4R05rZktjbEprRWdYdjdlVnl4NG9ZQUY0RHNELUlkMXExSnlucEtUWk9jLTJCLXd0akxHYUhxdVI5aXhrZlpSOHJ4Z2c9PQ==

thats my point though the peaceful people are people outside the crypto ecosystem the crypto people are the people at war you can attempt to bring the regular people outside of crypto people with an easy transition to crypto eg stablecoins just telling them to enjoy their value fluctuating on a daily basis is the end goal but theres no path to get there in your solution other than hope your words make them do it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTS2t0VTRWT1FvR0prdGhaUWJidmtxQ1RGUEpKZmlHaEtYV096Z003bVVxbkRPLWw4S252UmN0MElrVm9jZGJXZHA4Q2h6NEpKenl4SW14RzNlblJOU0E9PQ==
therein lies our conflict im only addressing people currently involved in crypto i have no words for those outside of crypto who are hesitant to join due to its volatility <number> of people are riskaverse and inherently illsuited to handle crypto stocks gambling etc they are not my concern my focus is on those who have already shown a tolerance for volatility i want them to stop hoping for the space to become safer and instead develop a thicker skin,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcmkzTk9ydUs0WXEyVVNkSXRPUFpJRDQxWFVoak9uX29tNHBFSUs0TDVIemxqalZYNXlFZE1Mb3RBaFFjUmpFb2hHQkxUOEEtQk9LazFOZFFtUTRkbHRyejVwaTVJNkVZRzBPYW9PejFwRnc9

well as long as moneros tail emission protocol doesnt dramatically change to increase the coin creation rate far beyond the rate coins are lost then stable coins are kinda irrelevant in a circular economy with monero as the primary currency the currency will effectively be backed by the demand for the exchange of products services and fungible nonrenewable nonperishable commodities to be traded with the currency and as long as theres unique utility to use xmr instead of fnrnp commodities as a currency it will be exchanged when needed for that purpose and as long as theres a demand for the exchange of these goods and services there will be a demand for the currency that increases the economic efficiency of the net exchange of these goods and services there will still be market crashes or declines that reduces the value of xmr shortly after a large section of the market becomes dramatically less liquid for an anticipated lengthy period of time if you want an asset that retains value independent of market demand then store a fnrnp commodity that has utility thats independent of market demand preferably assets you desire to utilize independently fnrnp commodity collateral backed stable coins require enforcement which probably is not what the average anarchist wants backing it using an equal value of xmr compared to the commodity without the need for enforcement defeats the purpose of these stable coins because xmr would be relatively less stable than the commodity in the market conditions youd be trying to hedge against,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRlRHT040Z1RYTG1sQ2FDdm1TMmQ5VUNWUUFkTmMwc1M1UmVDb1VJcnhaQ3lHYmRkWm4weUZVWXlYNmRBUVlKSWx4eFNsSGNERENkV1R2YjVtVmhkdDJiUFFfNEk4c3BUTHlpaTdGU1AweGs9

stablecoin have been a pointless idea since its inception people spend endless actual spiritual currency time+attention in running around trying to explain why the stablecoin is necessary cryptos been around for years yall still trying to force this idea every single stable has had numerous news making them worthless op fyi a stable coins real purpose has nothing to do with stability everything to do with adoption of the non crypto people to use crypto and bring their fiat into crypto as much as i like crypto the elite lost power and were unsuccessful into great financial reset thus all this energy on stable coin its overly pointless plus why would i trust nsacoin to be wrapped and stuffed into xmr when monero minded people dont trust anything from the corporationsgovetc or want it if stablecoin actually did what they officially say its supposed to then monero minded type people would be working a project for a private stable coin which nobody is,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeGN6cFRvd0hzMXpEZ2xEMHBaTFE4UHZnTUZRbTd5cllnX2NweE5ScTJDVHdWRVZHR3Q0aVk3LU1ld1J5aHZMS1Y0bndoNW56TlAxUWo4V01KSjV6WHc9PQ==

the whole idea of crypto is about privacy and for a totalitarian dystopia like the one which is being implemented right now privacy is a frontal attack against the state so such an attack was to be expected and the more they attack monero and other privacy options the more people will go into the grey economy like in the ussr and well be one step closer to the circular economy,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVZmR2OHB1UjdmbnowVW82MUtIcVJRaG1rSEFybUFrdklaY04xMjAtTGU4a2NTMVQwa1hfZFJURjZVWWJLaS11UlVWb2w4WEthaWdrVnJzSlIySTRUeEE9PQ==

i think its probably a coincidence or mostly a coincidence in terms of the dollar value of a cryptocurrency an etf does actually matter because of all the dollars that can only be invested in it if there is one same reason binance listing matters the sec seems to have not really wanted to approve it but did so because they would lose the ensuing lawsuit if they didnt they have a special hatred for privacy coins but also hate all crypto dollar value matters for network security but its not the only thing that matters one thing i worry about is that tradfi buyin will contribute to cryptocurrencies becoming less decentralized and more kycd a great thing about the monero community is that it generally cares about the privacy more than the price which i think would tend to become less true for cryptocurrencies with a lot of stakeholders that only care about the price and maybe are ok with losing independence from corporate and nation state control the way things are playing out currently to me does not seem like the ideal circumstances for rendering monero useless for its purpose the attention of institutional investors and typical crypto speculators could be worse than their absence,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVc2Vod3owa2VGT3RZWnRKOWxubFNiV2Z3VFVrOGNlTXRMM2hyNHNSc2RtSGp1SXFNaGNkbjc1NXJkYm1wV3ZuZlBfWVBOQ29uWnRlUHZac09PSHl6ckE9PQ==

he wont do this but if he did it would be a good thing people shouldnt go to jail because of what they put in their bodies or for facilitating people to get products they want if its not harming anyone to my knowledge the whole hiring a hitman stuff that was claimed to have happen was all fabrication that was never actually true the legalization of drugs is conflicting for me on one hand it would be a good and moral thing to do theyre only still illegal to get slaves for private prisons on the other hand it would really cripple monero lets be honest a lot of the demand for monero is these multimillion dollar drug markets the project could unironically be at serious risk of becoming too obscure at this point which is sad but its also just reality people dont really care about privacy of course the positives outweigh the negatives i wouldnt pretend that we should keep drugs illegal for the sake of a cryptocurrency project but it made me do a bit of self reflection on how financial motivations can sway ones moral character the first time i thought about it if you take anything from this though promote privacy principles to others its important that the project branches out from what is likely its main demographic besides speculators,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjSjdlVHVhNnZMSW1ETWpwOUtFWGpKRnJ4NnpYenJHTzQ1aGh2c1o4QVRIV2RHTDdicU1GeF9oMUxfVzJaVzN3ek04a25OVXY3LXJLWVQtcWlYRXp4WXc9PQ==

from a post years ago he hired multiple hit men to kill multiple people and those hitmen fakekilled those people and sent fake evidence of their dead bodies however the government was already on to him at that point so one of the hitmen he hired was a government set up so no one was actually killed i think the other hitman he hired was just a scammer so no one was killed then either he actually did hire them but they dropped the case once he got life in the other case for the silk road,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjMXNuNXEtUGpiTW9WVHduWVJINmlkRlB6Tms2enk3dU52V3NXcGd4Ukd5Wkx2bTQ0MGlFcm1wdkROZWxoSmVXc0xzb29qZkc0eUg1V0NGX0EyYU5OSlE9PQ==
im not convinced that the whole hitman thing is real most of it was popularized by youtubers who are known to lie about what goes on with the darknet not saying hes innocent either but i havent seen concrete evidence he was ever charged for it which is really what matters if he wasnt charged for it then there was probably not much evidence of it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQnhLa2tFNzg2MVVuTlQ5Y3NhR1lOamJTNWdxLW5QZ08xZUd2bzJJaW5LMzB0UldCTWZhY21MM2FqRlpDN3lZOE9fRi1pYWtiOFIxSlJGMUZkcGlrakE9PQ==
thats the funny thing he was never charged for it but he was sentenced for it feds posed as people who knew his personal details knew his address knew his family and threatened to kill them then another fed reached out to help the problem disappear now being a sane empathetic and rational person and fearing for his familys life he ordered the hit of course he was never charged for this if he were he would be able to claim entrapment as a defense however in sentencing a judge can use a separate set of facts that were used to determine guilt and these facts have a lower burden of proof than actual criminal charge so the truth is even more sinister the prosecutors conspired with the judge to get a sentence enhancement on him before he was even arrested obviously with the law intended punish cruel drug lords as usual prosecutors and judges who are mostly former prosecutors themselves have found a way to rape justice,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjeGhUS2JWbm05dkprYWtlNHM4bVFlTU8zQVFoWFpuU0tNY1JBUFVSQVBuM2ZYbzhGTFgxUGxXTWhZVzRVY1MwTk83MHcwbTlPZ196MklBZllhbzNwU1E9PQ==

i am skeptical about when multisig will ever be released i am aware that the new seraphis update is promising that but that is a long ways away at this point <number> that monero while a technical feat of cryptographic and engineering genius is failing still as socially it is not as wellknown or marketed as other cryptos and that also means that it will only viewed for its negative connotations privacy and freedom should be the default however sadly we cannot expect regular people to do their own reserch or market it do we have a monero marketing department <number> i just read another comment here and tried to get haveno working since kraken and other dexs have been delisting it in more and more countries or just outright delisting it globally as binance did is the piecemeal dex infra enough or far along at their stages of development to keep the passionate core of monero users and newcomers afloat how do we ensure also that the price stays stable or verifiably high if more dexs delist it and govts wage economic warfare against the monero project <number> are there any hw wallets that are opensource that monero can run on the monero seedsigner project is to my knowledge still not ready and trezors are opensource but there are exploitable flaws using trezors ledgers while cheaper also have that whole recover vuln and the company has made some very dubious choices in the past <number><number> years to put it kindly <number> i have many suggestions and ideas for a marketing campaign of sorts i am aware that many do not want to much less feel the need to market xmr as it does just work and it stands on our own but market share and visibility is critical to also changing the tide against legislation against it bitcoin was not banned but instead coopted because it was too big to fail after a while xmr cannot be coopted as long as the devs stay secure and true to their ethics the codebase is safe and not watered down by a change in the values or focus on the majority of the devuser base and so as long as it is so strong it can not be coopted however it can definately coopt or transform societies hopefully getting to a point where it is too big to fail and as indispensible in the near future as btc is today,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjRHA1T08zZk1DUGJwdjY4TUlXVENnVHdTR0pfWlNabVRjTERWLU1ILVJnb21ScVczQmtsZlJzMVNFQ0lyV3dabXJlVkZxVjE2RXRGM19MUFNYbE9OdlhON2RqSmdGckdlci1CWXFXQ0Fva0U9

he has pardoned people without institutional backing before so theres no reason to think he wouldnt do it again those who say he wouldnt are not considering his past behavior he likely would deciding who to vote for is complicated and multifaceted so im not suggesting you should vote for him just because he pardoned someone however those who claim he wouldnt are not seeing the bigger picture,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjSENGcUVzbzYxcDJBOHk5N21sd09fQmtUVGZNY01nS2dkOGRLMF80NGV5SV9oREJ6YnVLRTQtSnR6UkxlNUpiUGR0bjczdVZhV0hHTjR0N1VHcVZfcFE9PQ==

grin and similar scalabilityfocused coins cant compete with monero in terms of privacy and come with steep ux drawbacks as well that doesnt mean theyre not interesting or that theyre not more private than say btc but they fill a slightly different niche imho one which has little to no practical application in our current world any coin with optional privacy is dead on arrival the remaining options are either somewhat sketchy or have a vastly smaller userbase than monero or usually both,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjb1c1cUpocmt5dEp4NGptZ1lOa2Zqa0NLU3BROHc2QXpkYTFTMFZYTzVxSFowNTFIa0oyMmRXcV8zRVk4Tlc5NHV6a1NiWnUzclctYVprVENSbmo3Tmc9PQ==

im not convinced by haveno yet as i understand it even firsttime users have to put up security deposit in xmr i can understand that there is a reason why but its not going to make it simple to onboard new people to monero isnt there another way to do it a rating system furthermore it still seems like a bit of a hassle to install it and get it started i guess haveno so far just isnt what i had hoped it would be but i hope that it can still get there,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjVV8wclc5WE45c3VfMWQwX2p5WFB1dWNSQkc5Z19KVHM1WG5NNzh1N0RvWUVFSEsyY1hIMU16YkdlN0RhS09zaWljbHptVEd0dVpaTnlSc2d5MkNwN1E9PQ==

i understand that you cant rate firsttime users but maybe i should have clarified that so how do we solve this issue then it doesnt seem like a very smooth experience that even firsttime users have to put up a security deposit in xmr it would be one thing if it was fiat or some other currency but perhaps ive misunderstood it i was looking forward to start promoting haveno once it was easy to install it even for noobs but this aspect of it does make me have second thoughts,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOVlwUlNmSmVIVEZOSkNVcFUyVEFVX3JqdEtNWUpveVBSV3JxQ2twM3o2d013RXRyWmI0czRKUXdFR1ZuaVZpZU42dmQyS3RNY00yMXZtWldKRlNNQXc9PQ==

im not sure what the point is in using grin monero already exists and is already struggling to get users even if we assume grin is marginally better which i doubt is actually true there is no reason to use it when monero has much more usage even if said usage is low that is there are already very few people interested in monero why would they be interested in what is essentially monero with a few changes and no users it has no real value proposition,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjdExnN3FxbmMwMUtzajBLN0lJRDJEVk16ZXl5WFpFTlZYYjhlTGQ2LTJuU0VKRjJnSUZFOHZIajdWZEVHWXRJRTFrbURiYkRkR0dxMk9FdHU0U2tNZXc9PQ==

>i am skeptical about when multisig will ever be released i am aware that the new seraphis update is promising that but that is a long ways away at this point to be honest there is just not enough demand there is rhino wallet or whatever and some difficult ways to do it but in general most people are just going to wait until seraphis >that monero while a technical feat of cryptographic and engineering genius is failing still as socially it is not as wellknown or marketed as other cryptos and that also means that it will only viewed for its negative connotations privacy and freedom should be the default however sadly we cannot expect regular people to do their own reserch or market it do we have a monero marketing department usually coins with a marketing department had premines or some other way to market themselves the truth is that monero isnt very popular because people dont care about privacy enough to realize its potential it doesnt have promises of x gains like random tokens that technically speaking have no real usage if privacy not just monero became more mainstream then the project would be more successful >is the piecemeal dex infra enough or far along at their stages of development to keep the passionate core of monero users and newcomers afloat how do we ensure also that the price stays stable or verifiably high if more dexs delist it and govts wage economic warfare against the monero project in my opinion atomic swaps between chains would be the best solution long term then you can just get any token and swap preferably with one well designed gui application >are there any hw wallets that are opensource that monero can run on the monero seedsigner project is to my knowledge still not ready i dont believe so that said you can use offline signing instead you dont really need a hardware wallet if you have technical know how or using a tails install is a good option too for people who arent able to understand how to do the above its not perfect but its very unlikely to ever get exploited if all you do is run the tails install to use for sending funds its also simple enough for everyone if drug addicts can do it so can anyone else >i have many suggestions and ideas for a marketing campaign of sorts i am aware that many do not want to much less feel the need to market xmr as it does just work and it stands on our own but market share and visibility is critical to also changing the tide against legislation against it the issue is the lack of care for privacy that people have marketing efforts for this project will probably not do anything without getting people to care about privacy first promote tor in online spaces make people realize that their rights can be removed without the ability to communicate in a free and open manner only when people start caring about privacy would such a marketing campaign work otherwise all you would attract is people who are only interested in making a profit and selling,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjV1M2eVZvMWFLM2pjbVE2SzloLW5ERy04cDdsdjk0S01JUlhPcFA0ckhaS1FrQjUtOGNyUGRpMndsd0V0QzNUTVk3Q0dxcDgtUWVablJiV0ttRjBEVlE9PQ==

makes logical sense if a president can pardon completely absolve an individual of their crimes it also makes sense that they can also make a judgement on a punishment being too severe otherwise youll end up with the executive not being able to make grey area decisions they either have to absolve or not this allows the executive to essentially say what you did was still illegal and cannot be pardoned but your punishment was cruel or unusual so im pulling it back to be reasonable given some judges like to make examples out of some people given them extraordinary sentences outside of the mean it makes sense the executive can step in and go thats not your job the legislature and judicial consensus decides the severity not one judge with an axe to grind thats not to say whether i agree or not with the decision he was found after all to be trying to hire hitman,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTkJldFgzSjY0aVhQLVhQWnJybUJsMEZmeW9HRlB6cE9nMEhvNGoxdzZETXplaXRlV3RRc01mUXFiVzhnTUVpZnJDWExHaGhZa0lNNm1zQnpzQ0F3bUE9PQ==

>tail emission from launch is the best not really it means that it cannot function as a store of value in any meaningful way until a long time passes such that the inflation rate goes down the value of frontloading the emmission for monero is that inflation became low faster that said it doesnt really matter nobody has a reason to use grin because it doesnt offer anything revolutionary its monero except nobody uses it so there is no reason to care about it even if it is slightly better which i am not really convinced on anyways,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSEE2bG9JRzV4RDlJU1N1dTk1M3F5bGlIYjFEaGRnU1liYmlRQ1lDX0FRcVNzSGNWYUxuTkJMM1RoXzJoSk5zbkhWMnNMd0d2X0g4SmdQMFpOUFpuMlE9PQ==

i have mostly done work on the test net for the haveno project a while ago is there anyone that can explain how the arbitration works on reto since i see it mentioned that they have their own arbitrators and if its worth committing any time to the development side or are they flooded opensource can be a pain in the ass sometimes so pulling merging and trying to do things without communication of what others are doing is shitty especially since im not a dev by trade i just have been doing it as a hobby for years as im a physician,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYllTVUtNVHZWb3dUcE9qdjJHdF82SEhTbFFnc2VKRTNHU2FrbVBsbVV2eFlvQVo0dVVreFQzNGR0OFJ4Rjk2Y3lhVGE3LUlNOEFnckdsSU91aG9KN2c9PQ==

this following argument only applies to mass adoption i know that monero wont die no matter the price because there will always be people who require tools to protect their human right to financial privacy digitally delisting of monero is inevitable from many cex however there will always be some that do not fold to regulations or operate in places with strong privacy rights i do agree that a complete delisting from all cex is ideal for monero since dexs like haveno exist but if only a couple cex remain doesnt that give more power to control price to each of the cex as opposed to distributing it across many cex and putting the tinfoil hat on what if governments make deals with these few remaining cex to suppress the price of monero because thats the best they can do to dissuade the common person from using it outright banning it just leads to free press and proves that monero is too good,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlR1dXd2JZWEJ1YTNHblRUZl9nbWhNb0tmZ0NMYU9RMHZGZWR0aXdESjJfeHZzN3ZxRGxPNl9ZejhYUkRZZUFFZTI0VHhLbkxyYTQyWWI3bTNscVM5V0hzUDB4dGxpc3YxTkEzQ2lacVREOHM9

as more cex delists monero its essentially inaccessible to the common people price suppression is an effective method of controlling monero as less people will show interest in it however its true value is derived from its privacy technology ultimately what were looking for is price stability if it becomes too volatile it becomes a speculation game for example btc as long as the price is stable enough over prolonged period people will use it as a currency and storage of value irrespective of the price even assuming the governments underhanded pressure on cex to manipulate price the value and market demand is strong enough that its currently sitting at around <cur><number> thats a pretty good sign imo,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTUM2WDdLbUoxeDdUX2dCemRWbzZIY0Nab0F6UnlHRk5wWEVid01MeVRYZWU2YkJiMEpkbHo5OHAzb3p0SGJudUFDQkphRlJwVG9seDlCelVmZkJ0TUE9PQ==

indeed how does it hide the amount if sender and receiver are not hidden is it like z and t in zcash for amounts,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmM0g4VWQwSi1IdktSaUI3N2paU2I4Y25fc1FNSHF5U1BxZW9GNlFZb0trMzc3MnhtMHkzM01ReGZWbHdETzF5ZUEtTDEyS01oNmhXUE9WendZTXk5Z1E9PQ==
i dont know the details but i guess its like in monero monero has <number> distinct and as far as i know independent mechanisms to hide sender to hide receiver and to hide amount i think technically you could build a monero fork that could apply any combination of these <number> mechanisms to every transaction differently where you could tell your wishes what to hide with the help of <number> checkboxes when you initiate the transaction,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmd0tMZlAweWZJRGlMLUR5aWVONDB4NUcwalh0d2VONHZxSGxJam5tazVCS19PUE9Sa3hGcXAwN1hYQi1fQ2JjYTdOaXhuQV9ELTFDcUF0QkZ4MTdQUEE9PQ==
i looked closer into this it is possible to launch tokens on solana that have this feature enabled with the new token <number> standard but the issue is that currently the most commonly used dex like raydium for example dont allow tokens to be traded that have this feature enabled so you would have to run your own dex if you wanted to use this there is also the option to have an auditor that can decrypt all the amounts but that is optional and the token issuer can choose to not enable it but besides this new confidential transfers token extension there are also other projects that add privacy to solana with v there are new features baked into the solana runtime to compute zero knowledge proofs efficiently so while it is still in is infancy i would not dismiss these efforts entirely we should welcome it and see where we can find synergy with the solana community it is obviously going to play an important role in this cycle,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJma01fT0daNmxKSEtXcjZsTHFCcWdVYmt6UFhETnVBbmp6MkllaFBXbGdSckVWSHhFdndBdm9FVTNsWE9QZDlvV2c5U1pZZnNnb0tBY3ktTkVBQlJzNXc9PQ==
it depends on the issuer the auditor is an optional feature for the compliance vc startup people but anyone can issue a shitter with the auditor disabled and pump it to valhalla still the limitation is the lack of sender and receiver privacy in the current confidential transfers token extension but consider it more as an example repo than a full fledged solution so its just a matter of time until someone uses these new features that came with v to do something interesting,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmMVNZSEtMRW9XX1cweWlBbVpzZmV5UWptcmE5R1YxR0FmYnAxaEpNZVFqVXBKR05fQnVtUEVMUVRRUjhaUnFHU3ZjMXFzV3hCc2FSckZjT3ZPZF84M3c9PQ==
that is true for the ct token program but the ability to efficiently verify zk proofs in a solana program means that much more is possible,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmQlY5c0s3S2N3SGFkQS1nd0dlQ2VaMjNkYk9uVzQzLTVwa0VYV21nbWZLTU1renJ1N1BaX1RmZHM3T0kyY2YtSTJGYWZ5V3Vob2VLUHBXLXQ2dDVIaUE9PQ==

someones been screwing around with monero for a while monero has had a small but strong demand base for many years now the demand base maintains a steady upward pressure on the price but every time the price rises by even a few some scumsucking terdbrain dumps a hundred or so xmr on the market way below market price so it never goes up the way it should first i thought it was a whale maybe a developer with a couple of million xmr trying to keep it affordable to the masses thats kind and noble but also annoying then binance blew a fuse and people started dumping it and that just amplified the problem but only very briefly because those of us smart enough to understand why monero is the best decentralized cryptocurrency in the world werent going to let that fire sale opportunity pass us by recently it crossed my mind that the original dumper could be a miner but why in the world would a miner keep dumping their hardearned xmr at a discount unless its run by a well funded adversary the same entity responsible for the recent spam attack maybe last time i checked the price it was <cur><number> today i was pleasantly surprised to see it at <cur><number> then i find this topic here about the hash rate drop really i hope this means the original dumper shut down their mining operation and xmr is now free to reach escape velocity d,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuYkRvTkp3S1ZIanc3WHBrY3NwQS1VajBJOUZGMi1BUmgzYVVzZVlmVmtKbHVnSnQ3ektkbm9Mc2ZnTl90NEtDdjRQYXpsQjc0V01FcEFoZHg2UzNUZWc9PQ==

hey there are definitely some offers available at this time see here <url> here are a few steps to resolve your issue <number> make sure that youre running the latest version from the master branch as some recent update made offers posted on previous versions not compatible with the newer if youre using the docker version make sure to also update your docker image not just git pull your instance should show bsx v or higher at the bottom of the gui <number> as some mentioned you must have your coin cores fully synced up to see offers and also give it a bit of extra time after reaching <number> for the smsg network the mixnet that broadcasts offers to the rest of the network to also be synced up <number> if that doesnt help there is another issue that can be fixed in that case feel free to join the basicswap matrix room here <url> there are a lot of active contributors there that will be able to assist you in getting basicswap running properly and that will also help in resolving issues for future users as well and finally the more liquidity and the more people in the community post offers the more convenient basicswap becomes note usability and accessibility is a big focus moving forward you may want to take a look at this ccs proposal waiting to be merged <url><url> it aims to address directly a lot of the obstacles that makes adoption and usage of the platform a bit more on the tricky side at this time cheers,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvLTNJb0IwVFhieElLWFV6TExZb1pTNVFhVm1GeTlkT3dwVHpGV2Y0OUJCMjJqc0h3TE10VlYtS1ZNaHJ5QlJRLTRudUlUN01TYzkyTmdKb19WRld2Q3c9PQ==

im actually glad to see this mentioned i also thought it was a ghosttown before but as others have said at least currently i can see there are offers it is usable and there are offers but the offers that have been there recently have been priced pretty badly and also little liquidity per offer this as far as i can tell is due to several things regarding usability and functionality <number> offers expire with a max of <number> hours so either you have to continually repeat the offer manually or you could use a script which i dont know exists i heard of a marketmaker script somewhere idk even then i wouldnt just use some random persons script without looking at it it would be better if it came from the devs and implemented as an actual function in the interface itself to repeat the offer automatically this is why it seems completely dead since if people dont keep renewing their offers they disappear but its a cycle if more people were takers more makers offers would be taken and then the makers wouldnt leave and give up using it <number> at least with btc i had trouble trying to use several utxos in a single swap as a maker i always got errors saying that i didnt have enough bitcoin in my addresses to make the offer and when i made offers that were within individual utxos that was fine idk if thats just my system or what but that makes it much more annoying to offer larger amounts as i would have to spend the funds to consolidate utxos this i think is pretty huge for having bigger offers <number> getting things setup in the first place was fairly annoying and you pretty much have to be the type of person to run your own nodes for the coins youre swapping anyway even though i do like the interface generally and it is actually astounding that the atomic swaps work there are technical barriers that would prevent most users from even getting started although i will say ime bisq and haveno are technically annoying to setup also and they are actually much worse trustwise in terms of relying on an arbitration system which leaves me wondering why people always mention them and never say much about basicswapdex or other atomic swap software havent tried unstoppableswaps myself but i kinda sense its a similar issue w lack of offerstakers if someone has tried it id love to hear about it i will say that i believe this and other atomic swap systems to be some of the most important projects involving monero to me the main use for haveno is fiat to xmr directly but the arbitration system has flaws and really needs to be ironed outthe thing is its possible to completely sidestep those issues with atomic swaps we have the technology all it needs is to fix some not too difficult usability issues see above at least and more people to be talking about atomic swaps lol ps if someone could point out that market maker script and walk through its usage that could be helpful,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvajBsLXh2d21kd2doYUk1N3AxbUVEMDVUS1hLVGY1VnRGV3M5TmFwLUI1WDhLdDl5R1Z4WWF6djZfeDRMNjYzeUZfcGZsVElOaVRVMUE3cUd2OTYzdHc9PQ==

when a miner creates a block all hes concerned about is comparing the transaction inputs to make sure theyre all unique as long as the inputs are unique there are no doublespends so then the only data that needs to be saved in a block are the inputs and outputs from all the transaction messages if each input is signed by the owner the whole block becomes one big super transaction instead of a coinbase transaction the miner would include a coinbase output the elimination of transaction headers would save space or increase transaction capacity but in monero wouldnt this eliminate the need for ring signatures,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvckFRQTBKX2xLT2xSbVlZUUVVYzhTb3hWY3NnRHhQOUQwcVpWLXFobGZLUFVGd3VxbVFlVVlscmxSOEE0d1NRdmcxSFJvUHV1cE80STM2ZzVKV3cxRlE9PQ==

basically yes cake wallet is just that a wallet its a convenient one as it acts as a moderator for exchanges and the like but cake wallet doesnt do the exchanges themselves or anything just kind of mediate it cakewallet looks at your exchange request goes through actual exchange sites and aggregators that are trusted finds usually the best dealservice that can make the exchange at the moment etc crypto funds are removed from cakewallet sent to either something like changenow and exchanges directly on there or it could send it through something like trocador which is supposed to find the best deal from other exchanges like changenow no idea if trocador uses changenow but you get the gist,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cDVSYk5HbTJDSnppM0tSZGhhdWg0NkgyanltclRucDNvUklTcVhyMFlPOTc5VXh4Tm9wNWJzRVFpenRWczJBSEduOHRkQXNlT0ZRWWtvamJDSEJIeWc9PQ==
you would be correct cakewallet basically does the same thing as trocador in finding you the bestish deal or service that is readily available to make your exchange based on mininums and maximums and stuff like that best bet for an amount this high still shouldnt do it all at once is either using cakewallet and picking your service provider yourself instead of automatically or better yet kraken,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UmpHblZYWk9tV1MwZTBXX3A1RG9CMDMwYllWZHQ4cUxDRVpkR05HTWQ5TkFXSDl4ZWVnYXVtcUZfTVctSmpNV0FzQWRoX0RSVnRTcEpXYVZsRFRfVmc9PQ==

in pretty much all forms of ta if price action makes a low with great effort volume and doesnt get accepted with long term value it should be expected to make a new high look at the monthly chart its doing just that if we are to continue on the macro market a retrace to around <number><number> will be the last opportunity for the ride up to <number> + i got a big bag at <number> during the binance delist because all i see is value and if it does down down down i dont care this isnt a real investment so im not balls deep but there isnt any practical reason monero cant be top without institutional investment as ordered by regulators look at what happened to gamespot and shit once the public sees the value the use case and the fear that comes out of the looming demon that is cbdcs a <number> or x isnt even out of the question for me im waiting for new all time highs this year next year next bullrun whatever simultaneously when i want to buy stuff online from new contact lenses to my medical prescriptions that cant be filled due to shortages its nice to have a way to do that im not a criminal but if i could use monero as my daily driver i would i dont want governments having any business in what i do even though i have no shame i mean we all jack off and im no anomaly but theres no reason the government should be looking in our windows to watch us monero just allows us the privacy to close them should we so desire or rather closes them by default but you know what i mean i dont comment here very often but this community is great even when the project goes bearish it was someone here who helped me realize that deregulation is bullish as fuck mad respect to the unsung heroes and long live privacy,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4UXhYMHhELURpbktDYTAxNTFqUDI0R096SUw3cHRBM1BGWUUxUWp5a1VLNHhLSlVVOGQwZUVQY1dzQ3htREY0Rmk4MTBweDZqY3dFaEdQb0xCOTY5VXc9PQ==

a miner removing transaction boundaries doesnt really obfuscate the graph though since the inputs and outputs of each transaction are still visible in the mempool this is the same reason why mimblewimble in which miners already do this inputoutput aggregation still needs a separate mixing protocol like mwixnets to achieve graph obfuscation,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4RDIxamlxS3B1US1YRWx2aktpem9fdkpTSEJFLWNsNmpvS3RWb3RNS1VLOUhJS19FYVc5QjJKd2NQR0Qza2tzQVNaMG5JbTBkbjNSdGZMeTNIdVNPOHc9PQ==
i see what you mean inputs can only be obfuscated before theyre published not after transaction messages need to be encrypted but miners need to be able to read them so miners need to create them miners create new empty transactions each with a coinbase output and a public encryption key then instead of a user publishing their own transaction they add their inputs and outputs to a copy of a miners empty transaction which they then encrypt with the key only the miner can decode the copies combine them into a super transaction they then process it like a regular transaction and then process it like a block,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4LTN0WVJPN2EtcVRvYWEyNFBaWEUyUGpnRWxDYVNhbnFVNHdpNTNHOUpJc1c1YS0yelFuUGtnZnFrQnFOazJzQzlYX1k0VXYtOFJ6UktVMmVzcHVaNFE9PQ==

as of now monero is structured in such a way that new coins are added to the blockchain through mining any block is a combination of coinbase txs onchain txs and nonce that surpasses a certain difficulty threshold a transaction is only confirmed after its used to mine any block lets do a thought experiment hypothetically the transaction and block generation can be separated so that any tx will be accepted as long as it spends a valid input instant tx confirmation better scaling block generation will only be miners competing for mining new coins a bit more mining efficiency achieved assuming smaller blocks are faster to hash ppool will hypothetically be more efficient at mining as the total combination of txs + nonces is significantly higher or less efficient the major issue with this model is tx fee we may ditch tx fee but then its wide open for flood attacks is fcmp effective to prevent flooding in such a nofee setup is tx fee the sole reason that such hypothetical situation wont work what are other weaknesses you can think of,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NDlfYUZ2UE9IRE9TYWlpdWxqQmh3cDUyU3BSUXBCaVpQUXV2aElYTDNHNjdYbHZ5UXNIdHhXWlo3VWpXSEF0R3dOLXIyNVpVcm5IZFRiRzBqcHlYUGc9PQ==

the reason blocks exist in the first place is to create welldefined groups of transactions using them to distribute block rewards is a convenient side effect without blocks nodes would quickly develop slightly different versions of history with slightly different transaction lists which would result in newer transactions being rejected by some nodes due to spending unknown outputs thus resulting in more differences between nodes making the problem worse within minutes the network would dissolve into thousands of tiny incompatible networks with their own ideas of which transactions are valid,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cFpncUVwTXdUT2JPUWdKanlZd3FVRkRXVlNCRjhsSGgwVnEzNjU3bm5vTWtDaW41VVE1SEI3OEJvb1JDMDJvQS1NQk10QXQ5eTY4TWlnNEp4RWRCdGc9PQ==

i did not add any automated logging and my immediate reaction is that doing so would be an unacceptable breach of privacy quick note that anyone can review the changes made to the github repo there are not many of them if users are willing to submit logs from any issues they experience that would be fantastic and i would request that they run monerod with log level <number> to do so there is not a log submission process in place right now but it can certainly be created if there is interest both a large volume of transactions and a significant number of connections are likely required to address the issues at hand the primary goal is to have a sufficient number of connections for developers nodes thereby enabling them to perform effective debugging on their machines the stressnet is intended to offer developers access to a robust network being driven to extremes i have personally tried to reproduce the issues that some people saw during mainnet flooding by running a private testnet with <number> nodes on a single machine flooding that private testnet did not reproduce any issues so the stressnet is the next logical next step in my mind even in the early stages of the stressnet i have already seen excessive memory use and the approach has great promise in my opinion,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2UjVyc2R6eUM1ZWtOc2gxazJvRmlhZXJ2WXhLQkNTeGh0SExhOVEwRElDbTlZMEgyeEktUHRnQzgtN1dKVjZPa1l6X0JhWk42NnU4M2RxTUExcGQtYWc9PQ==

this makes sense to me i know there are remove all tax types that love monero but reality is that this is as likely to work as a communist utopia that people on this site love to fawn over read it will never happen someone has to pay for roads and schools and it isnt going to be out of the kindness of their own hearts i dont know if its entirely a solution though tariffs can help a country grow its native companies i think georgism predates the max influx of international shipping and trade there are costs and benefits to tariffs of course but in the long run it can help a nation grow an industry that is promising well something we can mostly all agree on is that income tax should be abolished the rich dont pay income tax they pay capital gains assuming they pay at all same with taxes on transactions since they would be impossible to track under monero anyways unfortunately well be stuck living with the current system for a long time it seems,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Wnc5SHBPOFJMejNPMzBUcF94YVdJWldJQllTWndwZ0YzOC1qYXlHMlFZSEtVODl1dHRCZVphU0c0a2Y3dHJRUHUxTVQ4UnhLZ3lMUlAxWWRRTmhXb2c9PQ==

true but its also pretty much infeasible to live in a society with no tax if we actually lived in a notax society people would eventually opt out of monero in order to have the goods and services a government can provide watch adam somethings video on anarcho capitalism where he details exactly how this would go down the fact is you cant get rid of tax and people would rather be taxed at least a little the only thing we can really do is tax as fairly as we can think of georgism does that the best and most people wont pay taxes voluntarily especially the people most able to pay them just look at billionaires avoiding taxes now and they have to jump through hoops to do so,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3S3pIMk1SMlhrcWlFVWRheXlOV1BCQWdycnJvUkU5NVRjT3FBTkktTDBHZFF2akdwQ0VZQVpDdjdmckcyR1lPT3pCVlhmV05nakNtZGt6S1FNMDFRVFE9PQ==

that is the point lazy landowners who do nothing productive create no jobs and generate no value for the world will be punished for it this stimulates the economy and creates more jobs and more productive entrepreneurs the people that use their land to generate value and start useful businesses for the community will be rewarded because they actually make money from their land if they cant do anything productive they will just sell the land to a more productive and innovative entrepreneur,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RGlGb2psZWVCdlNNbWktMHMzNU9CNmFYelVuN3hYSUQ0WUpMM29vM2tTTlctVzNVOUV2ZnpKcEh5dWZQQWZaTFc0bkoxVWlMRTNwTWZ6Ymw5T0lKV0E9PQ==
and again if even a relatively small portion of the population uses monero you wont know who is consuming what or how much income they are making so the only viable alternative for most countries is either a property tax or a land value tax a land value tax promotes economic growth and entrepreneurship while property taxes dont so land value taxes are better,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3U25zRmpZV19zcVlZNE53TmFRSGNRWHVqbjVqeUY2N21PS0VtM2trSU5Pelc0Rm5ySk4wcTFRQndaWk5kLTdvNTJMMlBMNWZwUzY3SWtJOVdhd1ZfUnc9PQ==
say you actually had a notax system the roads would go to shit and then rich private organisations would step in and set up road maintainers that only fix the roads which matter to them any roads with no strong profit making prospect would be left neglected and youd end up with a patchwork with bad roads around hospitals and schools and other areas the rich organisations didnt care about then maybe those private organisations would pool their resources into a national road maintainer for efficiency and each have a member on the board of that company to protect their own interests board members would end up fighting about which roads should be maintained and screwing their competition by voting against maintenance that benefits their competitors this is only my interpretation of the most likely outcome but im not sure if this is sounding like a place id want to live,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TmU0VVpOY1Z4UVh0VmZtY0JNbWVhRjI3RGswNVJwSDg5ckQ4czFsYUk2MmtjX1pBMXJmcmZ3SXRoYXk1TlQ0TWFncVcxdEJmYm1iZl9lcFdBSHRQMFE9PQ==
instituting a tax that only affects landowners is not only socialist in nature but also downright idiotic such a tax would discourage land ownership and proper land use while failing to generate sufficient revenue to sustain core government functions moreover a targeted tax like this is exactly what monero aims to evade and lets be clear my <number> flat tax suggestion comes from milton friedman the greatest freemarket economist ever and is backed by solid research unlike this obscure strain of socialism youre pushing,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3VFFJNlhOamFRRjlEbHNpYUYxUGUtbndPdlpvR3Q5SjNhYlFzYmZLSGtQbFFIUC1XMXVzZS1icEtwLUdaNm1VbGwwZ2dkb1I3TkVNVnNGX2NJbTRCblJKZTRneXI5S2NVUXAyUldoVVJMLTg9

haha you just lost the argument milton friedman stated theres a sense in which all taxes are antagonistic to free enterprise and yet we need taxes so the question is which are the least bad taxes in my opinion the least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land the henry george argument of many many years ago have a good night,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3dXlvY18tamdFeXdOdnVZS0pYS1ZwOTdQMmREeGVEZFk2bW9iLWtsbkZJVU1qbi1kei1keFMwZGl4c2NsZ2R0aWx6YVRfM3A4UDRLdHpGcU9rXzB2Nmc9PQ==

milton friedman in a letter to a fan of georgism the reason why i have not allied myself with the georgist movement is very simple while i share some of its views i do not share its basic view the basic fundamental view of the georgist movement as i understand it is not only that insofar as there be property taxes they be levied on land rather than improvements it is not only that property taxes at some levels may be preferable to other kinds of taxes but rather that property taxes should absorb essentially the whole rent of the land leaving the market value of the land itself essentially zero and that the revenue from that source should be the sole source for governmental expenditure i do not share those two views get blown the fuck out on your own thread,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Y29aYnJNVTJnQXkwUC1jMXVaUVJSQ0l1X01QUU9HdVNjZDFpd3l4cnBNNzdhUms0THZDVjFUSXBCVzM0WnM2TkpLbTVoSWZOZG1YZmpUMFZqZXdkWDJmX1MxaFA5aVNUQjYyNi1pVkpFaTQ9
no it isnt collectivism and you are allowed to do anything with your land including nothing you just have to pay for the value of your unimproved land not your property which is probably not that much if you live in a rural or suburban area your taxes would be extremely low under a land value tax,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3ZG82bi1YWnlMNU1hSFNleVJNVUlTc3NKd0hQNTBOVkNocmxVYXdaY0ptUnRtR1NKdXoyWGUteEtCZHhROFJRZmE3a1dXRy1TQjdRT3RLYnl2d2lZTVE9PQ==

bro what nobody is talking about aluminum or saying you have to do anything and it isnt a personal matter where a woke dude barges in and starts saying you have to do the greater good or hes going to tax you harder i hope you know that we are probably pretty ideologically similar being on this subreddit we are probably both libertarians and conservatively inclined we like free markets and entrepreneurship and we both hate taxes we also probably agree on that the government should stay out of our personal affairs this tax is essentially just an impersonal system that determines how valuable the land is based on its location and the population of the area etc it is just as impersonal as an income tax,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aE1lYkI4U3pOcFcxb1VpQngtNkxXS2Q5WDhFbXRUOTZYU25JUERDcEZGc1ZEaDVLbV84eFZHSVhleEhad0VQQTBVZm56cDlkcDFwMXplMkdCemhHRnc9PQ==

first he never said in that quote that it was at its core socialism and the fame level of the quote means that i can go and find the source of the quote easily while yours could have been made up by someone like you who cant see anything other than black and white communism vs capitalism the fact is that a land value tax isnt any more socialist than any other tax in fact it is more capitalist than income taxes and property taxes because it doesnt discourage economic growth imagine you are a wealthy businessman with an average plot of land to house your business you are an innovative entrepreneur who is providing a lot of value to your community your business is scaling and will continue to now imagine that the government knocks on your door saying they have noticed that you have made more money this year and so want to take more of it alternatively they could knock and ask for the same small amount as every year prior as you havent purchased any new land what would you prefer well someone who wasnt an idiot would choose the second option because no matter how much their business grows and no matter how much money they bring in the government will come looking for the same amount of money,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3c0hJcUlWMndtTWN2NVZjeU52dDNCeFJxRjNDc2ZkbDFmZUNRRDNXcWpIaG12bWhxc3o2cDNXQ2wxNnhNTEQwdEtZV2J4U3ZYbmZtbEZnWGVlbG0wQVE9PQ==

you are falling into a statist thought pattern there is no possible way for a government to know everything about all the relevant information to declare that a piece of land is shitty enough or good enough for a particular tax rate this is called the knowledge problem the government cannot ever solve the knowledge problem and instead they will rapidly devolve into a decision making process where they punish or reward people for doing what they want the system will inevitably rearrange itself into central planning,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3UGluRlVBZ2ZfTURpNkJUMlJKZ3V4T3ktUGVvWkd6WUQtSVZOdkczOWxsMmZPQjlDd3doM3M1Y2xGSHFtTDUwNGZpQzhrWHpMaURWZjBhaWxXbnNwQkdvMmtFNktMaUNTLWpwVW1PaTVOZ1k9

so land is an interesting topic as it could boil down to a philosophical question about land ownership in general so for now assuming that land ownership is indeed a right that we all defend then i still would say a society based on theft is not a society its a collective of savages and gangstas people are still in the process of understanding that you can not build anything on top of a rotten foundation humanity tries this for thousands of years over and over again its time to stop this madness and advance individually and collectively to a more advanced societal structure and monero is indeed a necessary prerequiste it seems to get there we will encounter new problems but for the first time in a long period we get the chance to break a vicious cycle,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3ZnNBREo1Ym44eDBSUzhoSUticWlUSm9DSnVQX0RPVDZuRjBMRkZVcU9oMUlfTmdzQm5PbW50clV0WFR2WUxCT3ZHb3hkZzdWSnE3NWdpbWFIdElHR3c9PQ==

i have been thinking a lot about tail emissions i wonder if the amount of tail emissions right now might be too high and i especially worry that the amount of tail emissions should track the price of monero perhaps indirectly and low frequency and therefore the tail emissions limit the value of monero my reasoning is somewhat similar to the stocktoflow argument on bitcoin value the amount of mining needs to scale along with technological advancement but technological advancement is relatively static in relation to money so a computer today might be <number> times more powerful than <number><number> decades ago but the costs of those computers is fairly similar tail emissions are there to reward mining so that the can scale up as technology scales up so from the argument that relative computing power is quite static towards money tail emissions should also be steady relative to money therefore if the price of monero goes up the number of tail emissions should go down otherwise the community is inefficiently paying for more compute than a rational costbenefit analysis would specify it also follows that the converse might be true a too high amount of tail emissions could keep the price of monero down since mining is ultimately a commodity service and dictated by commodity prices for computing power all in all i think for the long term there needs to be a mechanism to adjust the rate of tail emissions i dont yet know what the exact solution should be a simplistic proposal for illustrative purposes could be every <number> years two separate ccs proposals to dictate whether tail emissions should be halved or doubled with the ccs that receives the most xmr winning perhaps others have better ideas,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YVYwdThKQTlGSVRwSzU0UHF4SkMwbDZra2c2aVZ2dW1hYWNwLXlvaXBQQ1BRTlJwT2NZMWx5cHJiM09KaDdBSzgtYjFfYzd3ajhrdEFtMG15aGYxaUE9PQ==
and just to add an afterthought as a mechanism tail emissions are similar to money creation by central banks or stock issuance by private company it dilutes the relative value of existing moneystock in order to achieve desired outcomes such as for central banks price stability and economic growth or for companies company growth and debt management for central banks and companies a panel of experts continuously adjusts the strategy to find the optimal balance in an analogue sense tail emissions are a critical feature to achieve sufficient mining capacity on the long term but there is currently no process with the required knowledge and intelligence to determine the right level of mining that would achieve the desired outcome without unnecessarily diluting the value of the current monero stock dilution of value can also take the form of unnecessarily restricting the natural upwards trend in price final after burner though there are two competing incentives holders of existing monero stock would like tail emissions to be as small as possible to ensure price goes as high as possible miners would like the product of tail emissions price to be as high possible this subtle difference in goals needs to be bridged in an intelligent way when tail emissions are too high and price therefore too low holders lose out most while miners dont really benefit from the extra monero due to the lower price all else equal,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3LVk4V2U4YkMzcEVYanVhNUUzUE5LTEhzMEVVVkw1TktFaUVEcEJ4aUFxNEhZR0xOM2FuaWptQ2JjOHVIbkN5YWJ5cFU0NnhGY2szOUdhLTctekNSaUE9PQ==

monero tail emission is fine as it is monero price is under manipulation for a long time now theres no need to tie tail emission with fiat value and give the big brother government more power with a fixed tail emission you can know exactly how much monero will be in circulation at any point in the future this stability prevents any negative impact against its supposed inflationary nature tail emission is there to incentivize miners to keep mining bitcoin that has tail emission and cant pay their miners so many individual miners are just shutting off their asics this in turn makes bitcoin mining more centralized in that regard even doge is unironically better at decentralization tail emission also ensures that theres enough liquidity in the market it also helps the onchain tx fee remain low the hashrate of monero is already correlated to its price source<url> when the price is high more miners join the network when the price is low miners leave on average the price to hashrate ratio stays almost the same so no miners arent paying more than they make except the hardcore believers and botnet whales the difficulty adjustment takes care of technological advancement finally monero itself is supposed to be the currency tying any part of it to the traditional fiat currency is not desirable,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4NnRuMS1hVGxGYlpQcVpiLUZlaS01ckxsOVFEVjJNeHNRMGtXWVlYc3lfeTFHdmhOdWJscUw2cXFQS2NBT3Jzay1VOFZRaXNoOExad0NSY0RNRFN5aVE9PQ==

i guess you dont see the contradiction with the fifth and sixth point you make versus the other first four points but to me the contradiction is glaringly obvious i am not arguing to tie it to fiat currency you are attacking a straw man i am arguing for a better smarter balance between mining incentives and currency dilution and the need to determine an optimal rate of tail emissions you have presented no argument why the current rate of tail emissions is optimal why would a lower or higher rate not be better the idea is that monero must improve to remain the best crypto currency otherwise monero <number> comes around with a better balance and monero becomes an obsolete currency,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WTVGRmhfTElGeUs5TDA5RExjX1lzVm0yTm9aNTNjc0g2alpnWmhfNWdJd1Uzbmh3NG1HRm85cnVSc1pNMDlsNXNUaFo0NkJHU0pGb3FqQXd3ZGhuWlE9PQ==

im more a s centrist but even i know what this isnt true property ownership is as old a animals and predates the state territorialism is a fundamental property of most animals and they didnt learn it from us that being said the primal rule was if you can defend it or steal it by force its yours these days its government or your group will defend it for you and you might be forced to defend the property of others in your group,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aDNvNEJYQlZmcktudUFPLW1jY1dzdTFKckRmekRaNUNoZDN3aldRQWw5SmZiMXhVRFZmSWk5TlJuWVRUNTExaWlrVDZfQ0w3Tk42QnVtQXZyQmhwcGc9PQ==
actually thats not true back when cash was king businesses were still taxed and sales taxes existed governments just expected a cut of your sales and would occasionally audit you on it this was especially true in feudal times when the serf would have to pay a portion of what they produced to the lord of the land tariffs were also taxed as were manufacturers since they couldnt move there were many creative ways people were taxed in ye olden days that still apply today what distinguished those days from these days is that services were lower so taxes were also lower so we might have to give up a lot of services in order to have a more sustainable tax system in ye olden days charity was a lot more common and expected at least in the abrahamic faiths so if the tax system fails you will have to start taking care of your relatives and strangers since noone else will and you might have to pay doctors more since doctors used to offer their services for free to the poor through the subsidies of the more well off,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aUxfYlRsZDZEQVp4eV96ZzdMTXhNMUl4RTlrVmV1Y0wtLS1zeUg1eW1KRFFfSzNlVXdXdTYyX0VyTkZvY3E5X0s3TmZ5OG5KQ2hQQnBNYVZtdmp1U1E9PQ==

in my opinion the tail emission could be of any amount the market will automatically adjust the price based on its availability and value doge is a great example it has a tail emission of k per block because of its extremely high liquidity far greater than monero will ever be + its value speculative mostly per doge goes for less than <cur><number> despite having more than x the market cap this is the price the market decided there are already many candidates for monero <number> for exmaple zano smart contracts staking and much more zephyr stablecoin etc imo monero will remain the best crypto in the shortmid term there are various privacyenhancing features waiting to be implemented for example fcmp seraphisjamtis etc because of how rigorous the monero development is it ensures that monero will remain the best crypto in the shortmid term,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4UXNNeFk3Nnk1OTQwa1pJckprSXJmQzRJOERjWGNReEJMWktKdVlmdThWMzQ1QXNhcGdDY3NjcnRtTlJKWnptaW9wTDRTWENGN0Zvb3Y1VVJkSjltT2c9PQ==

when i came to know about this stripe miners existence i was paranoid that somehow monero has a nonce bias however from what i learned it seems like nonce pattern emerges as a result of using certain cpus for example check out this post <url><url> here experts can figure out what cpu a mining farm is using based on its nonce pattern as for why this miner is using this nonce pattern no idea it probably is more efficient for his bot farm to handle it could also be the nonce pattern of bitmains antminer x i saw them going on a huge sale some time ago as for banning the miner how do you do so ban certain nonces in a recent monerotopia podcast it was also discussed that mining is probably a less incriminating offense for a cybercriminal so interpol will less likely to act assuming hes even traceable big governments are also incentivized not to take action because this miner is sabotaging monero a major enemy against the surveillance state,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4RGx3VlhENVdOQVBSaV9fOUdCaElBQkZQVmp2bV9KQ1c0a19DOGRHZzVnMExUbkttT0ZQUUFLNjV3eWE2eWkzank4bDNGMDlheDN3NS1WWW0tNFRkQVE9PQ==

well im not disagreeing with you but satoshis original idea before observing the emergent properties of the network was that all nodes participate in mining so he would use node and mining node interchangeably he envisioned that mining nodes would be commercial endeavors in big data centers because he understood that to hash sha you get more bang for your buck with an application specific machine which is true and thats how it turned out but regular nodes i dont think he really thought much one way or another about that he did say that the block size can be raised as needed so definitely would not be a small blocker but he also observed a few years after genesis that bitcoin as a protocol had ossified and was very difficult to change i think all in all he created an interesting experiment and observed where it went after he gave control of it to the world by releasing it foss so i dont think he was overly opinionated on what should happen with it but the title of the white paper a peer to peer electronic cash system clearly tells you want the goal was when creating it and btc as it exists today is most certainly not that,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEYjB6NUFtT05CLUwwYzFYUlF4MmVkcFpzeUhNeGJudWNLbHl5OGxSNjdfOVB3OFJGaFFOemdqcE9KbnlBVC1CT2ZuamZTRm5fOU9xaDh4M1JtTlZab1BjLXpLN3EzVVNfajFRQTJfWkgzRDA9

seraphis as originally proposed is a new way to do output keys and linking tags key images its additionally become a series of new structures and a new wallet implementation with more functionality and efficiency if fcmp++s go well we do not need to undergo the migration as wed have achieved the same functionality without the new output keyslinking tag definition that means the benefit to seraphis the original proposal would be at best a marginal performance increase and maybe some niche commentary on specific security properties of walletsaddresses against a pq adversary i do not personally see that sufficiently worthwhile nor do i see us moving forward with it the transaction structures and wallet functionality would still be usable it implements all of the functionality that fcmp++s will add accordingly the development effort should not be wasted,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEVUlHeVFGMy1UM1pVVTFOdE5VLVVTVmxIbmtBWHdvMjBxbm53ZExhcHlXREstZEotYWh4aDVYMWZCaDljZzBJMXJaYjRmRUNzOWwxcUROaWFxTUxvRUE9PQ==

first on the menu or not once we have the technology the entire chain is now able to be reversed this could happen within our lifetime meaning the privacy risk is a reasonable worry monero is essentially a time bomb,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEN3lHbFNOemwxU2NfMVJleFdEcFg2QU9ibm51QTNIM2ljb1lPR2JweDhfWjlPT0EyenZiWlBLb0F1Z1JkM3M2TDk5MnRkUzNGZVg2aVJvXzRnQU9DWkE9PQ==
i think we will see the th birthday of monero without any fully working quantum computer in sight while that is likely true it is also very reasonable to believe that quantum could affect monero within many of our lifetimes it doesnt seem like an important challenge at first glance but when you consider the implications of every transaction once thought to be private becoming public it is a very scary thought the definition of a time bomb the sooner quantum resistant steps are taken the sooner everyone will have real privacy right now people have a predetermined amount of time before a transaction goes public we just dont know what that amount of time is rather than take steps to rectify the situation many would rather ignore the problem similar to how people will ignore debt collection letters until its too late,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEdWZwMG1QTERpUkY5XzIyRVJESkNOQ2RfREpGR0R3UGxjM1JFTE52NWV0NXg3ckF6bnVzMnZGMlVyYkRwXzlFWE9tcEZEcGJiVzcwOHF3MjdndHlHSlE9PQ==
it is a problem maybe monero wont be the first target but it will be a target right now people treat monero like all transactions are private while that may be true it is not true forever every transaction will be made public we just dont know the date yet if its within our lifetime it will be very problematic why go more years of creating transaction time bombs when we could avoid it all together by rolling out a new implementation,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZEhSRUk3YTYwdG5SbVBXUm1MY1FOa185VEdVb1ZIZHM3SVpaSzlDdHNMT2VqUkg4TU84YjVUd3o3Q1BSN2pIRGVmVlhGd1ExWkNoYzFXa2trXzNSamc9PQ==
it seems you neither used the search function nor gave this any thought if you possess quantum computing capacity the world is at your fingertips youd have control over the entire global banking system access to all encrypted communications medical records and even nuclear weapons why would such an entity even consider monero in this context do you think an entity with this level of capacity and the means to develop it needs justification to attack or retaliate against its perceived foes that would be like robbing a bank and instead of opening the vault to take the gold and silver making the bankers empty their pockets and running off with that,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEenlPS0FxM3I5M0hSNWV6dTZqQ3d2X1U3OE9SNGpfcXhBUzVxeG00SDhQWmhCNkRxSEtpSnY2SkE5eHFqcC1vUnVJLUZjNnQ3S0QyY2NyN24wMWtJN0JIMFg1YmVhYTNRSjZPUGFfYjVXR1U9

my guess is that satoshi didnt think asic resistance was even a possibiliity ill always prefer one cpu one vote over the alternatives i dont believe a fully private entry to the market is possible with only a few big miners on the market even when unprofitable i was mining bitcoin earlydays just because it was possible the gains where made with price increases later at that moment in time i was at a loss as well monero will follow the same path is my guess what if botnets start to use peerpool im actually happy with their presence tbh,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEal9IZDdzWkxDbjR1WWFPby1NaDJEdDlNT0Fvc3hnOEJ5US1VbGZlQzRxTS05V1U2d0g2SW16RWdKQXFKcjVuVVJNcUVsbGVHeHl4RG8wRzBRUUp1NXc9PQ==

you prevent it by randomizing the mining algo so a general purpose processor will always win out from the specific circuits if it would be gpu only it would also be less bad than the current situation with asics gamers would also be very happy if their gpus would get more advanced quicker but i dont think the bitcoin gpu mining period impacted the development speed of gpus very much the issue is that developing a gpu is magnitudes more difficult compared to developing a chip that only needs to run one algorithm really fast,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEcEp0c2xNU3dVeU9KRF9CMEs1SU9RaWVmWkVGdFFNM2s3NXVFSHZjbDY5MHo2WnY2a0poR0hscWl2LW5fY3lxbThJcy1GZEpyb3Q2T3JjNHM2c0M1dmc9PQ==

>asics are why bitcoin is so secure thats hilarious asics are why bitcoin can be seized by governments whenever they want a very few percent of people control the bitcoin network hashrate because asics are a naturally centralizing force >by the way satoshi knew that bitcoin would ultimately be mined by large farms of asics mining with asics was always the end goal satoshi knew that as the network grew beyond a certain point mining would be left more and more to large farms of application specific integrated circuits satoshi literally said this on the rd of november <number> just two months before he launched bitcoin lets give you that satoshi said this so what is your argument that satoshi is omniscient <number> was a long time ago are we really going to pretend that people knew better in <number> when there have been plenty of developments in computer science since then >at first most users would run network nodes but as the network grows beyond a certain point it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware >satoshi nakamoto ok now lets not give you the benefit of the doubt can you at least prove that this is the case why should i believe he said this meanwhile in the bitcoin whitepaper it is stated >proofofwork is essentially onecpuonevote the majority decision is represented by the longest chain which has the greatest proofofwork effort invested in it if a majority of cpu power is controlled by honest nodes the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains contradicting you so which is to be believed the official bitcoin whitepaper or whatever source you got this from >asic resistance is why its not profitable to mine xmr at home yes because asic resistance democratizes mining to anyone with a cpu if the total amount of money available from mining goes up more miners can easily join the network if it goes down people can easily leave the network without losing their hardware investment plus many people mine even though its unprofitable because of ideological reasons meanwhile having asics turns mining into a system where only those with giant farms can produce the monetary supply sounds pretty antithetical to a financial revolution if you ask me bitcoin mining is only profitable because bitcoin is expensive and because people are unable to join the network without investing massive amounts of resources which means the hashrate cannot follow the price upwards as easily but of course can follow downwards if mining conglomerates decide they are not in profit >asic resistance is why most of moneros hashrate comes from mining malware that is illegally installed on peoples servers without their knowledge or permission this does happen but do you have any proof that this accounts for most or even a significant percent of moneros hashrate operation endgame recently took down a bunch of bots so where is the giant crash in hashrate you claim this is why xmr is unprofitable to mine and that hashrate instability is because of this but its simply unsubstantiated,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZ1lLWWNRQ0JILXhHc3QyaGVMcHFVMWtGb0lqTkF6VV9PY3FTbmFCMUNHM2ptOFA2SFpzbVpTR3F0Tm1KeUZIOFQ1SFF1U0s1U21tbHh3Yk0ybUdRSGc9PQ==

id like to see this question<url> answered i really dont see how this service could be semitrusted just based on my observations it appears to be the same level of trust as any other instant exchanger at least if you use the webui i have no doubts that the manual atomic swaps done through the cli are trustless its just the webui that is a bit weird to me,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNES2tTY0J1TWV2dVNlbTgxc0t5ZWxZVllUXzIzSXhUaDZzeHhhdGU4SU9HRG13RDVJUzJUbmVlVF9Lb0pNcjdpelRCd2lqSzhBd25ic214RndKd1Nna0E9PQ==
its like exchcx where you need to put some trust into the operator of the webui but in that case it is better for at least the operator as they never hold the coins themselves and might from a legal perspective not be a money transmitter and more like an aggregator i hope this could develop into a solution where you could run your own webinterface that could be put on umrelos or startos,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQy1QTy05UHo1LUctdl84SVJkX0JCV2JSZFdWaXdlUmlWUHVFbG1lajUwc211b0VlTUxDMjJLUzYyd0wtT2ZmampmWnI0Qndzc21qYktIRXN0alRIdmc9PQ==

>they never hold the coins themselves what ive read about the webui on their site directly contradicts this if the swap is not performed by your browser through something like wasm it means the swap is performed on their server atomic swaps need some level of interaction so they would have to have the spend key for both sides of the atomic swap wallets aka they have direct custody over the coins and any claim that they dont is plain wrong this also means that they definitely can freeze funds from swaps done through the webui id be happy to learn this is not the case but its the only logical conclusion i can make based on the info i have,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZG11YkdHd21sWnBlMmtfUVdRZGF2OVlJZ19VdmVlTEpNQ25OdTJsa0M3MDdfd2RBNkVyWnNCekZGQXlsT19kVUpCUTdNN09sRG5hVm15Tmo5TkJaUnc9PQ==

you are correct there are absolutely holding your coins and i doubt they are even using atomic swaps in the background the swaps are way too fast the full process takes just a few moments longer than the duration of the bitcoin transfer an actual atomic swaps takes at least <number> minutes and their minimum and maximum amounts dont correspond to any of the publicly known swap providers entitites you send your bitcoin in exchange for monero to,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEc0VnNWVRWUhoTWlPWUREaTZSSTFocmF5MVhSWUp5Vkt2Q19iZ3hkQ3hfR0hMM0hEbGU3NDAxV2hqckpFUlRnMVY4cXZKMFhoX21JNmFleUFhQi1hMXc9PQ==

there is a trade off between block frequency and network health if you will the system that runs the network is a bunch of decentralized nodes if you decrease the block time too much it means that there is less time for the nodes to communicate to get to a consensus is <number> minutes really required nowadays well maybe not but there are benefits plus we could always just use zeroconf transactions since there arent the same issues as with bitcoin,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFbkFMSTI5WExIMW1YY183S2ZRNzJHQUxJTWZlU1F1aUNxdVVKS29LRmhyUkhIUGM1ajV6ejg0ZzY0TFBxUFo4LXFrTXRkXzJiS1Bid29pcjlWdkUxT2c9PQ==

the shorter the block time the greater the chance of a fork which means you might think your transaction was confirmed but then suddenly it isnt not much of a problem until the network gets congested but still an annoying side effect of fast blocks if the network isnt well connected it might feel as if you need to wait the extra time for a second confirmation on a regular basis and that means theres no time saved after all there is a happy medium and i think monero and litecoin at <number> and <number> <number><number> minutes are about right definitely fast enough for online payments imo lets not get into the argument about standing in a queue for groceries yeah,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNi0yWGNzVElOSEUySG9yM3o4dnNEZTdWQ3cyZWZhUzZkUmh6cW5ZS29wdW1TN1MtNy05SHBEUURab1RFN2o3UUdfZFlUeUF4eVl1WVc0SkpfTFpVMEE9PQ==

basically the transaction is broadcasted into the memory pool for monero nodes and can be mined for i believe up to <number> hours i do wonder if perhaps there is a way to store the broadcast so that it can be replayed if the mempool got congested but basically as soon as we see the transaction we can consider it as processed before it gets mined since it cant really be revoked the only way this goes bad is if the transaction somehow doesnt get mined for a long time and gets dropped from the mempool though maybe there is a way to replay the transaction as the merchant if that happens not sure,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFcTZhUlNEYlhxRnEybzdKZWNDeGxBT3kyem9oaERyQ2tNNWstSUpfek8xSVQ5ZXpqRFVTVXJmM1FKNVlkUzVNR0ZobmRFTGhjX2JibEJySjdycjMtWmc9PQ==
i think that image is pointless anyways there is no way to objectively measure using letter grades lets put it this way though there is no privacy coin that is taken seriously other than monero the second runner up zcash is a centralized token that doesnt have default anonymity is proof of stake has a preminefee from each block that goes to the company behind the token etc illegal markets only accept monero and sometimes bitcoin i think thats a pretty good indication that the other options arent very good you know considering they will go to jail if they screw up theres lots of other irrelevant monero clones and whatever but any time you look at them you realize how unserious they are either suffering from exploits having devs with no real cs background not being used having a premine etc,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFVHpscWdkVlk2V3ZfSlZFaElZR3prZ1Y4YlpOc3k0MGdqd2t1THhOY21UQWl5WG9QRDVaOTQ4MU4yMzNRRGE3ZnBVVWpTVi1EU3Rnc0lpb2U2ZUc5ZGc9PQ==

>while i partly agree with your points on zcash i think the project is trying to go in a more decentralized direction i think its too little too late the supply distribution is centralized so the staking will always be centralized too its also developed by a company so its not worth looking at in my opinion >about the technology while i dont know the details well enough to be sure it feels like zcash devs are more dynamic in improving the protocol while moneros promised core upgrades for whatever reason feel like they are taking forever the technology behind zcash is indeed newer and i dont really want to shit on it too much because i find it interesting but its also not really trustworthy and easily implemented incorrectly which they admit has been an issue in the past monero has more at risk with each upgrade there are more people actually using monero changes need to be peer reviewed and cannot fail when theyre pushed it also doesnt help that the development is funded through donations to a small number of people who are willing to work on the project its pretty hard for someone to work on a project promising radical privacy without the worry that they will be screwed over like the tornado cash devs >about the consensus pow vs pos and the default anonimity i dont think theres a necessary winner we can discuss on that but you frame it as if theres a stricly better option monero without explaining why proof of stake is definitely worse if the supply is already centralized into a for profit company if were talking strictly about decentralization mining with cpus is more decentralized versus having to run a staking node it makes sense for chains like ethereum though they were getting worried about censorship but it does not make sense for chains such as monero where the goal is to maximize decentralization theres also something to be said about how staking just encourages you to hoard money which is not a positive thing it also means that the richest people control consensus over the network i would be whole heartedly against a conversion towards pos for monero as for default anonymity there is definitely a clear winner since zcash does not have default anonymity it results in most transactions being public nobody uses confidential transactions thats a big issue because even if your obfuscation is mathematically perfect it doesnt matter if youre the only one using it <number> zec goes in <number> zec minus transaction fee comes out its pretty obvious to the human eye whos who nevermind other mathematical methods of correlation there is no real reason to not have default anonymity besides trying to appease regulators to try and artificially boost token prices clearly too little too late though since they often get delisted alongside monero regulators are not our friends they dont want people to have anonymity or privacy or any sense of self sovereignty,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFbTVBRkZwOWpZeWVGQ2F2SzQtOUtDWmxmeUgzbEN6dU15WEptXy1pSThYR1FSeTlIakhucW1CelNoQ1RRc2ppUHp4U1lsZUEtNG9qd1R0SmQyZkk1V2c9PQ==

<number> centralization is a vague concept in network science there are countless different concepts of centralization and as many ways to measure it a foundation isnt a for profit company monero is just not a legal entity while a foundation is this introduces an element of centralization but being the code open nothing prevents users from hard forking monero doesnt even have a dao for you it is a plus but at the same time you notice the drawbacks of a weak management structure who is coding what in monero why should i trust that its going to be shipped at time t and work if things go south codewise or anything else who is responsible who has a stake in the game except the ideological one which is based purely on trust <number> i dont know the intricacies of the tornado cash case but imo theres more than the simple criminalizing code that can be illused that we tell each other in the crypto space if youre just writing code you might be told to stop but you shouldnt go to jail or even pay fines but maybe im just naive <number> mining exclusively with lowend cpus is indeed more decentralized but it also impacts the capacity of the network monero cant scale much neither in tps nor in speed to finality is this advantage in decentralization more relevant than the drawbacks i wouldnt be so sure regarding bitcoin ie being able to use specialized hw pow can lead to centralization <number> regarding default anonimity id agree that default anonimity and the chance to opt out is better but im trusting you on how this works in zcash cause ive never used it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFd2M5a0lJSnJEZzE0a0RzS25xcXBsZnFIcDVROHFxR0FrejB4a2lzem1hT0JBSHRxeHJLWXgyZnlhZDNfUGdic1RkQm1qR0h6MTlFc2toLXRYd3VVR2c9PQ==

theres a difference between wasteful to the network and wasteful to methe user your notes about statistics are water under the bridge not to be hostile but im not a moron and i know all of that statistically there may be an even chance of a block being mined at any time realistically i mined for a month and got payouts on less than <number><number> of the days mining with a pps pool would get me revenue every day this is a very meaningful difference to a casual user who isnt participating over the time curve necessary to bring statistically into line with real life which is precisely why i said that ppool is far better for permanent hashrates than occasional miners statistically i can solo mine and hope to get a block in say y id be stressing expensive hardware and running an ongoing electricity cost for a chance at a block to me this feels a lot like playing the lottery people join mining pools to make mining feel more like earning or investing than lottery thus to me a pool that still functions as a lottery is failing to provide the key element i believe a pool exists for,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFQ0ZiSzRzRTMtbkNUZjdjaFRYY0lKUW5jNDVXNGtQWXFDWHVKVXVKeFhmWHBSRkdsVWY2d2h2Y3lzUG96UUIzaVVhVDBmWVdsRk95eVZMVXZ0b1dCLXc9PQ==

i dont know but here are my thoughts last time it took a huge exchange like binance to announce its delisting monero for the price to go down that low and even then it only stayed that low very briefly perhaps it would require an event of similar magnitude and significance for the price to go down that low again what would that be im not sure it seems like monero including its price is becoming more resilient every day that goes by but again i dont know no one can know the answer,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFd0dsX0VpZko1dnpJcWh4RjlJNmZqX3d4NlJnYkdzZTVFcUdETHBwRm55bVFXd0tTaGx2NFZzWWpXQnlGcFh2RVdmSF9OMy1ONV9WWmYzbHBIVVVjZWc9PQ==

>this introduces an element of centralization but being the code open nothing prevents users from hard forking this is nice in theory but not really true in practice the existence of a centralizing organization means they control much of the consensus so even when the zcash foundation makes bad changes there is nobody to really challenge them if you go against them nobody is going to follow you because the organization both has massive presence in their coins ecosystem and there are very few people interested in the coin with monero generally the devs make good decisions so there are almost no offshoot forks if however the next hard fork introduced changes that went against the general ethos of the project you would see rioting in this subreddit and numerous developers going against the changes >monero doesnt even have a dao for you it is a plus but at the same time you notice the drawbacks of a weak management structure it is a plus for me the idea of a dao simply hides centralizing elements of developing decentralized software it doesnt really achieve anything no the reason that zcash has a strong management structure is because there is a unified organization that employs people with their coins that they basically steal from the consensus mechanism its pretty easy to get dev resources when you can throw around money the fact that the take a cut from the consensus which i thought was <number> but apparently its <number> is enough for me to disregard the project its a scam >who is coding what in monero why should i trust that its going to be shipped at time t and work thats the thing nobody is forced to contribute to monero besides people who were funded by donations the fact that devs for the project are not one entity means that the project is more resistant to hijacking or negative changes this results in work being done at unknown times sure but if thats a problem then you can either fund more dev work or work on stuff yourself its the same model that other foss projects like linux work on >if things go south codewise or anything else who is responsible who has a stake in the game except the ideological one which is based purely on trust you could say the same thing about security vulnerabilities in linux the people who made the mistake are generally responsible the difference is that monero has cryptography audits so the auditors are also at fault obviously some of the devs have money in monero from mining when the project started so they have stake in the success of the project its also pretty hard to commit so much time and get paid to do so just to not care about the success of something >i dont know the intricacies of the tornado cash case but imo theres more than the simple criminalizing code that can be illused that we tell each other in the crypto space if youre just writing code you might be told to stop but you shouldnt go to jail or even pay fines but maybe im just naive i dont think this is true at all they were charged for facilitating money laundering but its not like they control who can use their mixing service the government just came down hard on them to send a message >mining exclusively with lowend cpus is indeed more decentralized but it also impacts the capacity of the network monero cant scale much neither in tps nor in speed to finality this is not really true mining on lowend cpus and highend cpus makes no difference to how much monero can scale it just changes the difficulty for the pow challenge we could change the block time to <number> seconds if we wanted it just means that the reward would need to be cut in <number> putting this too low means that there is more of a chance for the chain to split temporarily but this is more of an issue with getting the new information to all nodes rather than insufficient mining power thats what happens when you try to make a decentralized system if we had one big authoritative server that relayed the transactions then the tps could be really high but thats not cryptocurrency if every node was updated with the next block immediately then this wouldnt be an issue but obviously the internet has latency issues adding more mining power doesnt change this though it has nothing to do with it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNTRlaURPTjJMeWtIVWJZQ19nTmRObkthdHdrdnZ4Vl9VY1U1XzJrYUpGU0ZzRTRaV0ZMem1XRUI4eloxTGp0eDUyTklBdktGZ00wZjFtWk41eER4Vnc9PQ==

this thread contains some wrong information to put this straight please consider this quote from <url> i translate it into english each monero address has a shareable private viewkey by sharing the viewkeys somebody else can see the incoming transactions of this address however outgoing transactions can as of june <number> not be shown reliably therefore one should not rely on the balance shown with a viewkey of a monero address above formulation is in fact even a bit too positive the full truth is even worse lets compare a a viewonly wallet which has all keys except the private spend key with b the corresponding full wallet indeed any outgoing transactions are missing in a but what is more wallet a also shows incoming receive transactions that never actually occurred more precisely wallet a turns outgoing transactions into incoming transactions thereby letting the total balance shown grow instead of shrink for example on one day in <number> the actual transaction acc to b was two outgoing transactions of <number> and <number> xmr respectively but in wallet a these are shown as incoming transactions of <number> xmr and <number> xmr respectively so instead of reducing the balance the balance is even wrongly increased technically this apparently stems from the fact that only the backtransfer the change of an outgoing transaction is shown in a wheras b correctly displays the difference between outgoing amount minus the returning incoming change,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFSDVIZm9tZXhxYzhSSlZIdjB0d0dxY3hRT2w4TkVvTUpSamdnekdYWDF6azdfeEJxSjVxbmNrd1NLVU1GUXB3Y0pmYWlQdi14WkVvV1g3eXZkQmN6bFE9PQ==

while i agree i dont think we got here to early becoming the most widely adopted private coin will probably not happen by random chance monero and other similar projects will have to stand the test of time before that happens developers will have to show the will to keep the project alive and solve potential problems and in this aspect i really think monero stands out slow and steady wins the race,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFd2swMjE1SnNNNTk0cHFSRVNkZXl6LU1pVzZ5elcwYnNIVUFWNWtDdF9NbFhDb3Rob0ZGa2llMkVpUmVvY0ZtWEo4bTJqRFJ0YTJ1WW9hUU9yVlRsdUE9PQ==

fork dev forking doesnt mean you lose your coins in the official version it means that the official version isnt necessarily the good one plus what youre saying sounds like who starts with more moneycontrol inevitably wins in terms of network effect which is clearly false you reinforce my point about the drawbacks of the absence of a mgmt structure there are contextual advantages and disadvantages claiming that one is better in general doesnt make sense the comparison with linux doesnt make sense too because linux has countless forks with possibly lots of undiscovered potential exploits the forks of linux used in production and critical systems are mostly those created or maintained by for profit companies and other reputable entities tornado cash >the government just came down hard on them to send a message while i understand this framing unless theres evidence you could foia the prosecutors to prove your point i guess all that is left is the sentence and the process proceedings which anyone would have a hard time proving they show that the purpose was to send a message and not simply apply the law mining pow vs pos my point is that with pos you have levels of tps and finality provably as high as those required by a credit card service with centralized high end cpu mining you can probably achieve something a tad less perfoming with low end cpus you are very decentralized but your service cant scale much is slow compared to the standards of an internet connected economy again claiming that one is strictly better sounds simplistic,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFLXZPbm9aeXBwQ19wS0xjWG56RFY2Y2lwR1ZPYS1OQllydXA1cGlTMmt3Wlk1N1ViVXZDRktYM05KRWdXRkgtRW0wZl9feG5CMXdDbHRrRWNUYzhEWGc9PQ==

its a good thing if nobody gets rich with it as long as it stays stable monero allows us to lead a life thats rich in privacy and freedom which is more important than monetary units for a cryptocurrency besides theres so many ways to make money in todays world and if you find yourself supporting monero based on its technical merits youre already ahead of a large majority of the crypto space which means you have the potential to become rich if you really wanted and directed your efforts towards it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFV25jdElYR0pQdlRKVk1BeDg3M2laNEVtS29uNHRiZkFaVkdTdTB4VG9pOEtTOXRTMTRNMmhpNEF3Uk9Cei1XWXo1QzQySFdGcWhsTXZhb0dwWDktbmY1cjg3V0REd00yWnNZSHdUeUtHTGc9
i argue this is the golden era to buy youll never see monero this low again and youll look back in such despair and regret knowing you couldve gotten more but instead came up with all this bull in your head to stop you most people i talk to have no fucking idea monero is a thing or that bitcoin is a public bank account i mean fuck everything other than privacy coins are one i was testing this by having people on fb marketplace send me their eth address xrp bitcoin etc and some kids have a lot of money on there its worth noting that as these people get robbed and even murdered for their crypto well see a huge demand and possibly even monero taking the spot as king from daddy bitcoin nothing stays on top forever and to think that bitcoin will be <number> till the end of time is foolish as thats not how this world has ever worked with anything monero has swept the dark web and crypto payments we have all the original cypherpunks and people who actually got in for the tech this community loves this coin and ive never seen anything like it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFSGJXdi1rTG5zbGR6bGNRSGtSWkQ0bjdoT2U1T09DV3ozZkNUT3hFN3laaWVwdmxkY2trR0NVMlVQTmZPYlpmUFR0RldWbFJjQS1HWnV0QVAwZnpac2cyVEVfTGNiWFR4alNfU2RSQkRtRVE9

in my opinion monero will not make you rich sure it can be somewhat deflationary compared to fiat and maybe you will not lose money or even make some profit but it will not make you rich the problem is that many people who missed on btc are trying to get rich now with xmr  thats not how it works money is anonymous cash in my opinion it will never be main stream this argument we are too early is just bs you either use it or dont it doesnt make sense to buy and hold it for <number> years my god if you are here to get rich then you didnt understand it correctly although it would be a nice side effect for sure  fact is that we dont know what will happen in the future sure they might be a very small chance that will lead to monero becoming main stream but i personally dont see it for me it will always be nice although like i said it might go up in value globally,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFazJNZ0JTek9xdFJST2pRMXQwa2NMMWJpR3lkV0k2Z0doR2xMU2VKSjY0LThvUy11T2lXLVpCVWhqT0poR1JOdVZwWmdEWDgzRHlMN0tFWWZwT0taUWc9PQ==

i mean i would have said the main benefit of monero to me is the price is stable it can be used as actual currency and not worry its going to drop a lot etc the original premise of crypto was to replace money because its decentralised if it was to be a genuine contender as useable currency but keeps rising in value it causes major issues like deflation stable price is the pinnacle of what you want people can convert usd to monero keep it as monero not lose actual value of their savings or it rises in line with inflation it acts as money should but decentralised funnily probably nobody in the community here actually wants this though they want profits edit i just checked the price and its up like <number> since i last looked lol i guess my definition of stable is wrong haha,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFWkhYMXdlTUQyNmttMkdsREVYQVhPWDcxR0ZTejdQcE5WNVdBOFY1eXV1b0dYVGxPSHFUb291VHR3WHVabVdiYWdwaFI5MENTQ2E4TURudTdjTjFaZVE9PQ==
good god where do i start this video is bad please take it down and dont bother making any more videos on monero how old are you you sound like a <number> year old kid writing this why dont you stay in school and focus on your academics rather than trying to create youtube videos on a topic thats beyond your comprehension the video overall is extremely primitive and has a stupid ai voice you go straight in for promoting how to break the law tax evasion then you promote exchanges such as havena and then immediatley try to discredit them in a confusing way so overall wtf are you actually saying you then go on about wanting people to post cash to randomers for monero especially with whom they dont know this type of content truly gives the currency a bad reputation no rational person would ship thousands of dollars in an envelope no wonder the us government is trying to clamp down on privacy coins leading to a lack of confidence that potentially devalues the currency due to lack of wider confidence in the coin stay in school kid get some good grades and get a real job,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFSElheHFtZkw4bkxoZGtFRkQ4Z1hHQlBRMlFPSW9HRHF2ZFAyUTBiRXlEV0J2OE1KMkdWVXQ3eFhRTkZTR3lfTnhZUkhHclBLektqeG1SUWFYNkRjbEE9PQ==

nice comment full of facts and i agree with your opinions thinking about the irs a <cur>k bounty actually doesnt sound that serious we are in the early days of adoption and i expect crypto to ramp up a lot in <number> years and that bounty may go up with it more importantly when it comes to them tracking transactions i honestly wonder how the irs is going to do this when certain people make <number> txs or more per day have dozens of wallets and many txs across apps that arent usbased or even on the radar yet in a vast growing ecosystem that even ai would struggle to keep up with not to mention that most of their engagement in defi probably lacks any form of kyc of course irs agents themselves could never sort through every us citizens transactions fully and determine their actual gains but i honestly doubt they could get far leveraging ai even not to mention the fact that nobody owes them anything in the first place because the irs taxes people based upon their citizenship which is a corporate contract that they never agreed to in the first place my guess is that each individual is on their own personal journey of selfrealization and will be handled wherever they are at meaning the irs is a small hand in the big picture and will slap a few people around while others who have outgrown that engagement have other fish to fry,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFT3dpS0FVdC1jLU5uTWdVZDM5UWxyejZ2ZFpSOVhyUzdzVm1zanVjb1FRMFJ0VXNURU9QRWdSc2wxVTVuN0ZtQ3B3M01Bc0F2OFpoaDZTX2JoZmV3Rnc9PQ==

>forking doesnt mean you lose your coins in the official version it means that the official version isnt necessarily the good one well obviously but any chain that isnt the one maintained by the zcash foundation will become a ghost chain the point is that you have really no power in deciding what happens to the coin when they control essentially all of the discourse around it there is zero chance that there would be any momentum against any bad changes they make >plus what youre saying sounds like who starts with more moneycontrol inevitably wins in terms of network effect which is clearly false proof of stake rewards you with respect to how much money you have the devs of zcash get <number> of all staking rewards they will control more of the supply than anyone else the devs literally control a disproportionate share of consensus and share of the rewards there is no real point in considering zcash anymore nobody wants to adopt a currency like this with such terrible economics >you reinforce my point about the drawbacks of the absence of a mgmt structure there are contextual advantages and disadvantages claiming that one is better in general doesnt make sense this is not true at all when it comes to basically anything else its better to have a management structure but when it comes to cryptocurrencies you cannot have a management structure without centralizing the project having a management structure means that there is one entity that does all or almost all development it means that there is basically no push back when this entity makes a bad decision its entirely unacceptable for a decentralized currency project >the comparison with linux doesnt make sense too because linux has countless forks with possibly lots of undiscovered potential exploits the comparison does make sense in that linux is developed by volunteers with no expectation of delivery i wasnt comparing the type of software being developed because that doesnt make sense a fork on linux is inconsequential there is also probably never going to be formal verification for the linux kernel so of course there will be exploits formal verification takes a long time and the linux kernel is giant we were talking about development methods within the context of development methods its a good comparison >the forks of linux used in production and critical systems are mostly those created or maintained by for profit companies and other reputable entities which isnt a contradiction in monero we have projects that work on their own stuff for example cake wallet which contribute back to the project its not really different than what goes on in linux in linux companies make their own forks and then people take the stuff made by these companies and put it back into other linux forks in monero companies make their own projects and then give back code relating to other projects or the main monero core project the existence of companies in the ecosystem doesnt imply some unified centralized management system,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGT2ZRSzNiM0JZVzV5OXBkZXI5cVVjU0YweDlxSGt6enhKaDZLTU5vQVkxdlhEb2pPaGctUnFPM0o2RF9xQWI1Q3pUbzB3YVJIZEZ5alh5MkFycElqdEE9PQ==
tornado cash ill just drop the tornado cash argument if you think the us government works for justice then i cant convince you otherwise its already over with regardless of what we think pos >my point is that with pos you have levels of tps and finality provably as high as those required by a credit card service i dont think you really understand what youre talking about there is no increase in tps that comes from proof of stake if you have a limit on how much data can be stored in each block you have a limit on tps if you have a limit on how many blocks can be created per second you have a limit on tps proof of stake solves neither of these things just making the chain proof of stake doesnt mean you can add terabytes of data to the chain and it doesnt mean you can make it so that you can produce a block every minute nothing particular to proof of stake improves finality either the main issues with finality are whether or not a transaction will be revoked transactions can potentially be revoked on pos just like they can be on pow by an attacker but that isnt really the main concern with finality the idea that someone will try to attack a chain to reverse transactions is silly in either case the real issue is a chain split which has nothing to do with pos or pow and has everything to do with how fast you can update each node with the current chain state i believe dags solve this though but arent unique to any consensus method the point of cryptocurrencies is not to recreate the current financial system if youre trying to do that decentralization has to give so there is no point in doing it in the first place you might as well start a fintech company >with centralized high end cpu mining you can probably achieve something a tad less perfoming with low end cpus you are very decentralized but your service cant scale much is slow compared to the standards of an internet connected economy again claiming that one is strictly better sounds simplistic there is nothing inherently centralizing about high end cpu mining versus low end cpu mining you arent going to be able to make enough money mining on a cpu for it to be worthwhile to create some centralized asic warehouse like people do with bitcoin thats the whole point of avoiding asics it means that more people can mine with their already existing hardware and therefore the difficulty is more fluid and attached to the price someone trying to create a mining warehouse for monero is going to be at a disadvantage now the other part of this that doesnt make sense is why you think less hashrate = cant scale scaling has literally nothing to do with how many cpus high end or not are on the network the only thing that this effects is the difficulty nothing else if we had x as many cpus it would not make the block time change if we had x less cpus or hashing power same thing it would also not make the block time change the block time is hard coded to tend to <number> minutes we could change that to something else but thats a different discussion the reason that cryptocurrency chains do not have <number> second block times is because you need to update the nodes in the network on the current state when a block is found everyone needs to be informed about this if we have short blocks then there can be issues where one node doesnt understand that its behind what does fix this is the advancement of high speed internet nodes need to be connected over the internet with as little delay as possible this isnt unique to pow or pos though,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSFRTY09fempETjNXbjVwbzNac2xRMHZzTWRCVjFnaEdTVjdqNUtmQnZuSXNUbHdZTzltb19BRXRGdDBGOHV0SENnVnpuQ29JbVZUU25EdmJMNGZsV0E9PQ==

cryptocurrencies have a nebulous status in any state the point is that the monopoly on monetary emission is one of the inherent properties of any state therefore cryptocurrencies are not prohibited in the vast majority of countries but they are not allowed either in general cryptocurrencies are not about you and me cryptocurrencies were conceived by the emerging new financial elites as a means of overthrowing the old financial elites simply put there was a war between the silicon valley people and the wall street people so far neither side of the confrontation has succeeded so its not that so few people know about xmr if we were all paid our salaries in xmr we would know a lot about it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGcldMOGF4YTRrNS00bE5idTQ0cExWTWV3UXlsNEZvYWQ3SjYxb3M0bVNKXzRsM0NwQUIzZ2V6eTZnVmJRNUpBanBCdnZCLVQ2TDliWjh2UTFfaGprY2c9PQ==

i dont think there is much action going on there yet unfortunately a big reason why is the lack of promotion and the poor accessibility but its also just the fact that its very new and perhaps there isnt that much trust in it yet however i think it will gradually get better as the developers behind it seem to be quite active hopefully it will soon be made more accessible with a website etc once we have that it should become a lot easier to promote it to a large number of people,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGc0VLNkVwbjdHam9MY1k3NUpBZUYyNjJyazVSWTVIbklua0ZuRHBEN1d2cEdoVjhnbWoyUE44RnF2bDVnb3R0UF9pYlFod1lFOThOMUkwOFBfWXdycmc9PQ==

i installed haveno and took a look at it i really like the idea and the technical realization of it but personally i cant speak for everyone i would prefer a good web application with noncustodial wallet support and pp trading functionality bitpapa for example has a good ui in my opinion would be nice if there was a mix between bitpapa and haveno though,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGbTBjWndnemt5NVVVM0gtTmFmSWhGckxoSXFwaU1lUDFlVk00Y3Y3MzFfUmFqV1BlVHEyLUQ5MXNNOWxLa0NUV3dGTUU0eGp0NEFsa0llOVc0WFlIenc9PQ==
its unfortunate but typical sites provide a single point of failure especially now that le is stepping up their enforcement to bring down unregistered securities thats the beauty of haveno and open source personally i hope more people make an effort to use it because really its the only way an anonymous crypto will be able to thrive long term,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGb2NyNVFmTEtMVENkSlFYTjdDbmU0QnV5OWp4SHNWdlNGTUQ4czQxY3R4VVVQbVJEb0ZIOEN6ZDRPWWNoMGVFR1FWczdoVnVtYXBCeTlkc1BHWG0ydWZpNUhUOFBMaDNGNnJwNFBjbXBad2M9
yeah i agree on this youre right but what if there was a web based onion service for example i have to admit that i would rather use a simple web interface reachable over an onion address but for now i would also prefer haveno over everything that has been published here,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSzcwNUowQ2txOXhZNFdBeEgzOVQxSERkd2FncUxvQ1g1MTNWcjFhRXQ4Qk5uTXUtVEVjUGU2TWF5MWFBdE1ZYnFCRXN0U2RzU1dGV2ZhcUxDZ3lHS2c9PQ==

likely due to haveno being very much in its infancy i completed two trades on there the other day worth <cur>k+ and i like the way the security deposit and tor routing system works point is its a promising decentralised exchange that can only really increase in popularity and use its just waiting thats the hard part,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGaWM1bS1RdHZrT2Z0bUdIZTRxY2E5WDBJanI5VDlEckZSVTA5aE43clZJTXBnNHByZ1ZQQ1k1MjRadFBWWWNOdmRpSWEwNW5HRFdPMVRHNmVFcEhJaFE9PQ==

i think it will be important to establish xusd as a common swap pair with a more common token like eth to make this sustainable if people can just mint <number> xusd and cash it out with your company for real usd then you are basically just offering to buy xmr for usd with some extra steps for privacy reasons im also curious how privacy is preserved when interfacing with real usd surely if i buy xusd with usd and then swap that for xmr onlookers can tell that i bought xmr and similarly theyd be able to tell when i sold also,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHbUxCMnJiQWplNk1vZE9sZHZFTllyZjdxTjJTaDU5ODMzRml1SFdjcmtPcGk3OTl2V29LV3BXbWcwR0NCU2tsZVY5bEZzOUNrd05zLXRVTk96LXg0Q0E9PQ==

the bch tokens carry their history and therefore it is possible to see where they have been bought for fiat money usually in an exchange with kyc on a public transparent blockchain like bitcoin and bitcoin cash surveillance companies can track which amounts went from which addresses to which others addresses even if mixing is used not ideal to preserve our ability to transact freely and privately,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHWUhyRWFhY1I1TzZHd0RWR2h6elJJS1pveEVDNzQxbGpkSXJxNndtcW0wYVp5U3F4cXk4bUpoTFgwcmZ5MDhHV1o1RGtGY3RKaE51dVkwMWFLLWx0T0E9PQ==

kraken may not be fractionally reserved but they are a bank and that means they get to make the rules and just like a lot of other banks they like to close accounts for no apparent reason they share your data with government agencies and are part of a consortium that aims to track illicit transactions are they using their data together with coinbase to feed ai models you can bet its not safe to use cex people should be actively discouraged from using cex even if it means slower adoption,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHSHZGMmZiQjQweXZyQjNrTWNYUHNqQnJFaUdCY1ZyTmhmN3VEQlNwWWduRWRsZHhUNlpCcEVzWkVYU2pwZXJ4NFZIQVVidGVaRUlNYlZfNkJZS05fZnc9PQ==

yeah i didnt actually mean buying directly as i can see that its a swap service however and this is the main most important part ive seen sooo many postscomments about getting xmr from tradeogre can you swap on tradeogre to receive xmr theres even a link at the bottom of the website thats titled how to buy monero and on the subsequent page it says buy xmr on the monero markets with two coin pairs regardless of which i click on it only allows me to sell monero for the other coin xmrbtc or xmrusdt wherein the first coin in the pair is the one being used to purchase the second coin listed i am soo confused ive literally clicked every possible clickable link throughout the website none of which leads me to be able swap a coin or purchase xmr with one of the listed coins,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNdExFWm9IelNOZE1NeGVzeGFuX3FYZG5fS29JOUJpOVB1Ry0zS2VXM0h5TnRDT09mMUdLQnYzZVh0aENJV1Y0YVBOc3B6U1JyTDdrUXlNMVp5ekF4Rmc9PQ==

i can see how it could be attractive to luigi to have an employee type person around see talebs blog post <url><url> more expensive like the <cur>kyear equivalent rehrar is asking for expensive but if you want things done you dont have to wait for someone to volunteer this is sort of what core were doing with rehrar before it cant work now because <number> going through the ccs changes the relationship to more of a contractor <number> rehrar only committing to part time while having other employment and even his own business means its not possible to get the employee effect with him <number> he has already demonstrated that he will just leave when it suits him very bad employee and even took one of moneros prized contractors as his own employee in the process i think the monerobull option is a good one to at least see how it goes its like volunteer plus probably will get the quality of a dedicated volunteer better than most employees with a bit more obligation due to the payment if monerobull cant commit enough and its found that core needs someone to act in a more indentured role then someone else other than rehrar should be found because of the above rehrar is not even a good contractor in <number> rehrar was essentially subletting sarang to the project in an arrangement where sarang was to get the reliable salary he desired from rehrar while rehrars only real purpose was to deal with moneros volatility during contract periods the fact that rehrar then asked for more monero because the price fell during the contract period is just ridiculous because dealing with that volatility was his only job and i cant imagine for a second he would have given any xmr back if the price had risen,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNYXpNX1NQeEpmRk5GUV9DM0cyUWcyajhsV0hQbHk2Vnk4YWFjcHB6SnNJRUdhdWdXc3ozRzZhLXR1UDNwSDRGTWVraThrbkVJWXB2WUs0aFdyREJnSlE9PQ==

my pov is that in a society trending to high surveillance states privacy will increase in value every movement has a counter movement afterwards in art music literature economics politicsetc surveillance states will generate the opposite movement if it will generate a movement against it network grows thus makes it a reasonable store of value well you nailed it way more maneuverable to be in monero too,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORnZaYnZBUmQxNFRfaktJMVNXNlJyeFlEa0dNOHBjSVVYNXFpWG1PN0NXNkxWVGF0VmFnUHRaZ09wOWFRNFZyVlFZRVNTZFNOaEtycjM1MHN1b19jUGc9PQ==
i stated this many times over the past twelve months but i see monero as a relatively poor store of value in comparison to bitcoin the growing lack of exchange options and trading liquidity that comes from that puts monero in a tough space in terms of money flows in atomic swaps are probably the best bull case for drawing more on chain demand in terms of utility monero still has an important and highly functional place in the ecosystem though privacy really is its killer app as opposed to being an sov ill still hold monero for that purpose but i hope to hell that ill never use most of it because if i do i suspect that well be in some kind of world war scenario,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOczZrSTI5S2U2NnZZSmVtS3d5UlhqSllTdHI4T1d0SG9haWwxVUd6Vk5FT0NQQll5ZFV2eVEwdFRpM1c5Q1JIZFhjN05td2twRl9OWUVXR3JZRlJkVGc9PQ==

i disagree because the benefit of the monero network is the essence of what crypto shouldve always been private decentralized and untraceable its has a true value for that alone and as people realize that banks cannot be trusted it will be a great asset to have not just for trading but a solid investment in the future,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORklHVWNiTW9BMlk3ZkNqOUZ3VmJCM3g5dElvVy1ZWWJJdUpSWkpaYjJDTWJ1LXZlQjIwcjZNMXA4OUg2ZWlxN3FFY3RvdkIybXZTZkFqVzhzSWpsa1E9PQ==

i largely agree with the first point although in reality there is no shared essence of what crypto should be to all people if there were it would be a religion and thank fuck its not i disagree with your second point because as stated above i see the liquidity needed to move a market cap of moneros size as insufficient without enough supporting exchanges as i wrote i think atomic swaps may help in this somewhat but i dont think that it will be enough to keep pace with bitcoin over the long term when is what op is suggesting and we have about a decade of data and a <number> loss to this point fwiw,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOdWg0NjhYUWhVbWJOSExteG5aTHlnb2xDTXlSTGFYcnhSNUJwa0hVWkVkSktXOXR3QkpFSzJsS0hTQWYxalRFVzVIbnlsSDExZnYzQmVuUENZeTNLRlE9PQ==

thats a valid point although i guess that depends how long youve heldintend to hold for and who the counterparties are for your transactions if youre transacting a bunch then i think you have a point although you face the same kind of offramp regulation regardless of token and in the case of xmr those offramps may well cease to exist full stop all of my btc are long term holdings circa <number> that dont move other than to send to an exchange to sell every few years so from a personal point of view the point is moot,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOS2tYVmNpTnVaQ1h4bURwbERWZnZoelZLZTd2ZFpNc1JMS2R2YldkbGNoVHVLTWlZeHYtU1EwS2hDNkhVNVZpZnk1N29mZXN2akVIek9jQkFqRWZrc3c9PQ==
i use trocadorapp<url> to swap to another token network to monero or from monero to another token network and since these instant swap exchanges seem to have less regulatory pressure it is possible to end up with tainted tokens but impossible to end up with tainted xmr not much else to say of course if you bought your btc on a good exchange and you only hold your btc on the exchange or on a wallet and you never do anything with it you will most likely not have the tainted tokens problem,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOTmkzclNwX05mOVVwSjVFdTRtSkxTSm5DOE8yY3dRQjN5M1J0S01GTkFuYUp1RXp3U2trOXhTQ0lMVHFzTU5Sc0NMSFpQYTVKcVFZcURHczRNajNjRHc9PQ==
ive read it i wrote a phd on decentralised media i agree with the right to privacy but not all activity should be assumed to be for the common good like most things in life people do not operate with the binary intent described by most manifestos but again this thread is about monero as an effective sov relative to bitcoin,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOd085VFNvMlNIdmdfWksxUE5xemJTSVRRZ2VGbnNfTm5KMjBzOG9ueDVKRFhxSDNDaTlNc3RfUFJmNHhBdkRRUzduU3NHRl9FYTgwMFFrUDBkbVpBNVE9PQ==
of course not everybody has a good intent but it was already the case with physical cash or with silver gold coins the idea of monero is to be an alternative to physical cash in a digital peer to peer version via the internet if governments want to get rid of physical cash or want to push too much restrictions on the use of physical cash the problem with too much surveillance is that even good people become suspicious because the rules of what is good and bad can change according to the whims of the politicians in power and then it becomes difficult to talk about some things or to support some alternatives initiatives people being able to hold a crypto currency privately and to use this crypto currency as you want to send funds to pay for something to donate to a person initiative peer to peer without any surveillance or any restriction is an attribute of a useful store of value imo the weakness of monero at the moment compared to bitcoin is that it is less known and less understood and therefore less used,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOUVl6b3o3UzVtUjFIQTkwNnBkNHQyM2N1eHZQUHRIZnNNN3ZXSF94alpIVEdTNkY2LVI2dGRVYkZvUEVoTFRnV1oybEN2YXB5WjVqbGRZLUNOa1NQbXc9PQ==
again this is somewhat derailing the thread i mined monero when it was released while writing the aforementioned phd and im well versed on its privacy intent im not arguing those points other than to say im a pragmatist and there isnt one protocol that solves all problems even the privacy space i also use railgun which allows transactional privacy within the ethereum network and likewise to get back to the thread bitcoin remains the best sov imo the weakness of monero in that regard isnt thats its less well known its that its privacy focus brings certain market limitations and therefore also market participants meaning that it will never have sufficient trading liquidity to justify a market cap as large as bitcoin and thats completely fine because it fulfils its privacy purposes brilliantly thats a different kind of value,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOLWRyZEgtMkE4VWcwQmNmTzM5dUx0OURXVEE0R1FGVjlIZ0xtZ3FsOVQ5SWR5Z2xGdnl0UzFUNmpvNTZ2R2VhclZRaGtrbzdDMzNNOUlGZjNCYy1ka1E9PQ==
its valuable and more so because privacy will become more important as time goes forward we cannot depend on private companies to hold our assets it has failed many times and it will do again fiat currency is simply not stable for any person if it has an unstable authority,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOWEZBYXI1SUVxTVFoNC1fMDhFQkRLVm8tZE5uT1FIVWZSa25EMnotZUJtRW52VzI5Y1FNRk5yTlZoY1FYNV9KSF9pandGby1tR1A4MXNNZmxXQmtPdEE9PQ==
im not sure if liquidity or ease of exchange really has any impact on how good of a store of value anything is historically the main store of value has been gold and hasnt the liquidity or ease of exchange of gold always been way worse than that of monero is now trading actual gold is really hard because its heavy and costly to securely store and move around there arent that many places in a city where you can actually buy or sell gold and you even likely have to pay huge fees at any such place at some point people started mainly doing the this paper proofs that i own a bunch of gold somewhere and trading that is easier but im talking about before that existed and when trading gold always meant trading physical gold thats in your possession,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOYWF5c3FhMTBlanQtN3cxZTBiV0lhRG9yXzBvQ3A5S3JTMldERWdWaUZaU01JZk4wTEFUZlFWS01teUdwLS1LYWJCOEFXbmU4djh5UUtkS0V2QjRjVFE9PQ==

i think you made your point for you its been a long time since the main trade of gold was via a physical act most gold is traded on futures and commodities markets its literally the most traded financial asset outside of currencies ie it has a ton of liquidity for context daily trading volumes gold billion btc billion xmr million,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOSGtLZ0lRLVc0ZGxfOHVOQjBDZ2UtQ3ZIZnVVV1MxdW5WM0c4SGJ2VXFJODBPalZfdk81LVpNQWdxWWZLSGhRbHNBV1BmSGNPdnpWWllLUHItbnJtd2c9PQ==

a deb file is an executable on linux a zip file is a file to compress other files you need to unzip it to get to a exe file on windows and likely you will need to define an exception in your antivirus software psa if you still use windows you should learn about linux because all the privacy benefits of monero and other endtoend communication tools goes out the window on windows windows is a tool to <number> surveil you even before encrypting your money or your communication in which case you could also use transparent coins other than popular believe linux these days is super easy and straight forward you can even start it from an usb stick and make yourself comfortable with it before installing it as your main driver,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNObzJCUkR2S2puUW8yVjRHWElzZC01a0NOaGpySzBsNFF3OGFYbDA2bFZDOUd4Yi1rUUR0UThUcGtjQ3NfcE9zQWZibmpiekN2bllkbUxzX0JNNkxtV1E9PQ==

a unlikely to happen because monero as a software has been around for a relatively long time and nobody found a way to crack it yet but it would cause a large price drop in the event that it does however no matter what bug is found the worst case is it ends up a cheaper alternative to bitcoin until devs figure out a patch and a hard fork occurs b probably not because most normies dont care about privacy,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOZGxHTGNheG83dUxtQkN1XzlpMFo4ZWVKR0ptZmI3X2liN05pUDd3M3JzWXZxOTZEcERvOElGZmh1dTNQaWRqNERjSldUa3VSWVBsbkJwVXBKdXdCb3UzcjBaNHVFYnVoYVVTaVRPR0wwdUU9

dont fall for the hype an intermediate good which makes an excellent money will also be an excellent store of value the idea of separating out the storage of value function of a money from the transactional function of a money is a crutch for intermediate goods which make for a poor money in the case of fiat this is because the marginal cost of production is essentially zero and in the case of bitcoin this is because the blockstream devs have intentionally crippled its transferability and ignored issues with its fungibility,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOMGpES09Zbmh5cmo0NmZ4UTROREFXRjBrVkxHREZuSHZlWFQtZ3NmUjFnUzZ3QWFKVjExMGlWNW5zWWNvVkdKWHBuVUExRTB6R2RHdGZ1eVYwSDhnb0E9PQ==

unlike what the btc crowd hawks via line goes up i love the fact that monero will inflate against bitcoin in time a good currency needs to inflate overtime to act as a store of value not an investment explained this in a longer reply somewhere above and no a currency should never be an investment if it is to act as a store of value,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPLU1DcmVVa1Y5T3RFUjJDekVOczdlSTB4dkl1YzRPdURIM0lBelpnNGc1VldmaXdPMHFvNXJiRE10Yl9CQW9UYUlQMmVNYzZfTnZ5SmZkOEQtVUdOTkE9PQ==

yes from a game theory perspective hodlers in bitcoin are free riders their wealth is protected and its value stored at no cost to them but theres a cost to maintain the network that is the infrastructure that gives their holdings value they bear none of it the people that bear the cost are users people that spend bitcoin this is why we see the trend being that bitcoin is a hodlers coin and is not used of course the ultimate outcome is that miners wont be profitable and so security will decrease and with it value if people dont use bitcoin it cannot have value for anyone this is of course a consequence of a hard cap and all hard cap coins have this problem a tail emission accomplishes the predictability of supply that a hard cap does while avoiding this free riding problem holders pay the network to secure their wealth in the form of slight debasement of their wealth and they pay it in proportion to the amount of benefit they get from the network because every coin is debased at the same rate every block,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPdDk4UWdSWl81UlBNVkQtb0t1blhGZkstb2FfS29TSVhqbUZMSHY0UVliSnNDLU1QaThaS3VOUnc1bmZhOF9NZXVFZHc1cl91VVVVNDMzNFFMdTBGQl9qODU1d3hZcDJiSnJodmdFcnBQN289

easier to conceal you have to physically store gold and silver somewhere carry it with you and physically give it to someone who then has to hide the fact they have it and conceal it somewhere yes youd have to hide monero too but its a lot easier to hide a single private key whether on a piece of paper or in a password manager a file somewhere on an otherwise innocuous usb stick etc also what about for big payments if i want to bribe a politician or a senior police official for <cur>k or <cur>k youre suddenly carrying a pretty damn big chunk of gold with monero it makes no difference,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPUlRqcXdCNk9GQnFfTXB1Y1c5ZUlhNnJ6bWRXWGFmbHRBMG5Ka1VSTUdZcFVIcjNDNDlSdjdSVVVvSk5YTjJNUkM2NHlPZlpXR3BLWW9nQmVnRXdvOGZfVzUtb3pLY2ROSm5hakFuZXROYlk9

well its certainly fun to make predictions <number> or <number> years ahead but i think the hit rate will be abysmal especially in a fastmoving field like cryptocurrencies i suspect nobody saw bitcoin coming in <number> a stroke of genius and where there was nothing suddenly there was something and it became successful even dominant for a while think it cant happen again especially with a time horizon of <number> or <number> years out think again who knows whether just tomorrow somebody invents a new consensus algorithm that is better than both proof of work and proof of stake and each and every coin that uses one of those immediately becomes a dinosaur bitcoin and monero both flipped out of the way maybe thats impossible maybe such a third brand new class of consensus algorithms does not exist but hey do you think that people in <number> would have deemed proof of work distributed consensus to be possible until it more or less fell from the sky monero has very good privacy but most people have no idea how complex the implementation of that privacy is spoiler the mind almost boggles for that monero works considerably slower than bitcoin and transactions are considerably larger in bytes you cant really forget any transactions on the monero blockchain and prune it either because you dont know what is spent or not how about somebody coming up just tomorrow with a radically different privacy coin technology that is in comparison with monero at least deadsimple with tiny yet still fully private transactions with a small blockchain somehow again maybe such a thing may not exist but can we be sure before the arrival of cryptonote people also may have laughed you out of the room if you suggested an opaque blockchain and i could go on maybe in <number> years people may simply mostly have lost interest in cryptocurrencies they may still exist but be about as interesting as fallenfromgrace nfts are already today who cares monero will or wont flip bitcoin <number> yawn you want to tell me both of them really still exist,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPbFNMcTRKUDdLTDNfa2NGNXZob3YxWWppY2xrN1ZKRG15VXRsa2pjeEJMbnBFM0VwWVo0dHNQNzJNeWhMMk5XUDZ6TkxmVjlqRzZ4Mm43ZG9ramxpSEE9PQ==

to play devils advocate couldnt you spend tainted bitcoin through the lightning network you open a node start opening channels with as many nodes as you can and then once you start transmitting those bitcoin you kind of clean them i have always thought the following i am not technical enough so maybe what i am saying is absurd but if you open two nodes in lightning through tor those nodes are not connected directly if i start sending btc through lightning to my other node using multiple paths and then close channels for both nodes havent i cleaned up those bitcoin wouldnt they be very hard to trace,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPU3d3Q3dLSTRHWXdnazk4Y3F6U2RFUFJRNFNwY2daZVEzc0NLNVhocGNBQnBsd0lnbWo3dUNMRzJjZVNPWHNyRWxob2g4U3FnWjRmX1JfUjY2UkVwNm90c2k1V2ZsOUJFd3FuVkJneUQtbWc9

i think sending messages to companies to get them accept xmr is not really going to work especially if theyre from a template even if you can convince them to accept it there needs to be enough people who actually want to buy their product using xmr it would probably result in a negative result if people spammed a business to accept xmr and then nobody bought anything from them i think the real way that monero becomes popular is if privacy gets popular that means promoting privacy projects in general ie tor as a means to an end to people who dont know better i dont know how any one person can do that though,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPLTc5dXo4cWhIV3B6dEdPQUdVWm5NU2ZWWFVkT01sR2tfQ20yY0lRMU1xa1dDUjdKRVprdTFqdnhUaTlqQ0hVODJrQWhRS21kQ1RERFozMnFpYnVsRWc9PQ==

any atomic swap project that doesnt solve the problem of atomic swaps in both directions will never gain traction from users in my opinion the system has to allow makers and takers in both directions with minimal friction i dont like the extra complexity of liquidity pools but no atomic swap protocol with monero has figured out a way for frictionless bidirectional swaps a liquidity pool solution in competition with serai dex but based off a different technology stack cosmos sdk instead of substrate as an example could be good for monero i wish serai dex huge success but competition from at least one other project might help serai be the best that it can be provide fall back options and make it harder to shut down decentralized exchanges for monero,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQOFdJMk5wRC1mZ3ZKUW9LZElSNkVaYWc0WlhBQjIxeUVPX3BKdl9HY2psMWd6U0RRZUtSM3o3SGR2dUo3eEtIT3QtakcxUDNybkIwQlRlWllqTGNDWWc9PQ==

absolutely bidirectional swaps are an important feature and not being able to swap monero for bitcoin from the users perspective is limiting that being said we dont know of any implementations of xmr<>btc bidirectional swaps that dont require another blockchain since these chains are small and add complexity we dont think this a good approach using a new very small blockchain like thorchain or serai is also a security risk especially when it has only a few dozen nodes and is therefore much less decentralized than the monero blockchain see <url> atomic swaps are the only technology that allow cross blockchain swaps while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain luckily swapping monero for bitcoin will be possible to implement using only those chains when presigning transactions becomes available in the next monero hardfork until then any implementation we could think of would be vulnerable to dos attacks while we think that btc>xmr is more importantuseful than xmr>btc we definitely are excited for presigning and onchain bidirectionalatomicswaps,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRNjVmUkFUdTZlUmhSUXItN1lQTkowaFFpSW0xWG5jQkFSc2dqSTAtV1llWElFNkt5aGNoX3RrbWtWMTR0T3dBSGljRzBFZ0kxNVJqTlp6Wk5leS1OSEE9PQ==

> what would the world be like if americans didnt fight for their independence from britain meh a better example of a just war in america would be the indigenous people resisting ethnic cleansing unfortunately they were outgunned plus very significant usuallyunintentional biowarfare but it was still an actual example of a just and righteous reason to fight >or the allies resisting hitler the allies are currently conducting a genocide of their own so stopping hitler was good but not so good if we just make another one eretz israel is the new lebensraum >even more recent ukrainians defending themselves from russia complex russia shouldnt be expanding but neither should nato be expanding up to russias borders thats the exact same thing with the roles reversed which almost caused nuclear war during the cuban missile crisis and although the us didnt invade cuba with its own soldiers in response it did launch the failed bay of pigs invasion as is standard us foreign policy we do something then declare war proxy or otherwise on another nation when they do the same thing we posture ourselves as the moral authority in the room we arent never were and at least so long as we operate under capitalism never will be most importantly im sure neither side gives a shit about actual ukranian people well fight to the last ukranian and all that so no im not going to deem that a just war either just because its not a baldfaced genocide doesnt make it just or good or virtuous,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRTzc1My1jQ2F2aDdtUGdjU1cyWEVkNEtJZ0FtbklTQ2d5SkdpR2ZHYmZFZUxfNjVBRV9nbExpUTBscW5uMFU4dU5xSHBxazdMTk9XZ1ZZa0NjTWROVGc9PQ==

i started using haveno a few weeks ago and im never going back once more people get signatures it will be amazing just realize if a lot of sellers are capped at <number> xmr per trade at the moment so you have to chat it out if you want to do multiple trades it would be nice if they allowed you to text sellers before initiating a trade for instance to request another payment mode because if your xmr is already locked up you can only have one type of trade set up you can set a sellers name to whatever note you want so thats pretty neat i think the future is in applications like haveno because of this whole kyc thing rather than try to outsmart exchanges we need to get more and more decentralized,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNU9SUE1mWW5rQk5ZTDY5cS1WMFM1U1BXMG9oN3VTeHlzTlB0NzF0WVNWa0V4aXJEdk1XYzJfbndxblVnSWlCQmpWbTEybi1qaUxUVndSYUVObU8yQTJlZmRaUDdqbWItRHRQNDl6aUQ1c009

i think as decentralization gets more popular we could have more vendors all over the world willing to try face to face exchanges this solves the cex issue but brings up a host of other safety issues personally i think the best way if youre into crypto is to buy it regularly so you can withdraw from exchanges to your bank account if you need to but some people dont have an option to do such,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXd2RFa0Jsel9icWhRN2NtZ3FnSTNjb2h6NFVGVm9FY0R2NkIzbjR6TkxXVC11N0xGY2o2YUxranB5UG14RFdVWmhycTNvZFd1N3FvSHdScWdGMXQ0NkRtTkZyUzQ0RnlPQmdRSVRtVEh2Wkk9

well once you play with their money thats when you have to follow their rules you could try buying goldbacks<url> or possibly find someone like minded who will accept the monero for cash but as we know from history thats how they get ya so if you want to keep a savings in monero id suggest having friends who will accept payment in monero now on the other hand if you are willing to play by their rules my suggestion would be you move some of your earnings into an proper investment account that while yes it will require kyc lets be real if you where able to avoid kyc entirely you probably dont have a bank account or much money to start with you can take advantage of capital losses and work either by yourself or with someone who know your governments local tax codes well enough to offset any taxes you might incur by cashing out along with a few losses ie convert your xmr to a memecoin that you lost money on so you can declair it as an overall loss use some of the funds to make tax deductible donations and other tricks the rich class have been using to keep their money in their own pockets for decades basically just take advantage of all the loopholes they have while keeping what you arent actively spending in fiat a secret,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXTlpLV29GWm9hd0hwUU9Qdnk5aEhtTjFmbC1KbTVldkY2bXRyS0oxR2paMzZjeERmY1ZlYmNBM2ItdmxpWGN1T0tPeDVHQnNSaXRNX3pxQ3Q0djNvY0E9PQ==

its the most common questions and i think to say yes it is possible but not without tax implications your coins could get locked on an exchange converting back to cash if there is too suspicious of activity this is why pp is just better here is what i recommend though if you must absolutely and want to raise less red flags buy any major crypto from said exchange first dont withdraw much more than you are buying in legitimate crypto wait at least <number> year to start cylcing out of crypto back to fiat to avoid <number> year gains tax if you cannot wait one year be prepared to pay <number> capital gains when cashing out alternatively you can sign up for an exchange like cryptocom<url> which allows a visa card that can run off of tether there are limits to this as well if youre withdrawing cash directly from an atm and it requires some kyc to get bonus levels you have to stake their cro token hope this helps,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXUHVqM1VQSUN6cVV1M1c4WFlELUVYTkxXdDJuM01VcEJBNTE1Vm5qbnF0TUtjTGNsaTlqUzdObE12NjZwWkFmQy1Uel93NzVDMDRnUjJpdzV4TXZ4NGdmUW5xMDZMX3NEeUZFNnV1R0NkckU9

well the easy way is to just comply with kyc because sad as it is thats the world we live in but if you arent doing anything illegal then there isnt much reason to avoid it your bank and most every other payment method you use besides cash already has kyc on you they know your spending habbits etc so you really arent avoiding that anyway and if youre actually doing shady things then there is no better way to look less suspicious than to cya by keeping a normal stock portfolio with someone like robinhood that you can point to as your main income ifwhen anyone decides you deserve extra attention,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWlM4R096UzZvVXVBSTZ0dEhsOWRzUFVsTi15c0dYZEJCanAyNHVheXBUb3BnajBaS0NRR3JIODRDODlHYm56MTBnTE1jS3RGaTQxV3ZGWUZ3UlhOSmc9PQ==

sure if i can figure it out anyone can i think xmr really needs more laymen who can explain things in retarded mode for the average user though a lot of time when i was trying to learn i feel like i was getting explained things in a different language when i needed someone to explain it to me like i am actually retarded the devs are just way more advanced than the average user so going to git hub for instance for the first time there are <number> files to choose from and a little icon with a green tag for the latest release as an executable ie not very retarded friendly,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX05HTGZfeXlqRmU5RFRhckpRYUFBUVBDOXRyNHVmLVN0NlpXOHc4Qm50ay1EMGF6UHlxRUdYamg4MG4tZTFNSHIzYnFrOWM0VzhnVGdPZHBzcXVpRUJzeGQtVDk1LUlxRGNjSmxPS1ExbTQ9
sure all the information you need for this to work are accessible i agree but a few days ago i met a friend of mine he is not very familiar with computers in general can browse download install things and use office on ms and tbh i dont think that he would even get familiar with the ui at least not on his own also isnt it recommended to set up your own monero node not necessary but recommended in order to use it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUFN4WVQzVFAwUTNVR21rX2I4a0VzWWg2UkQxbHhEaGhENFlERG5hM0FqN19BaWJPU1VoVHhDVFotcEN4dlNEVlBUaDQ5MS00bVhab2J6dmNqSDdJMlE9PQ==
i cant argue with that there are a million reasons why xmr is a great crypto though even compared to the more user friendly ones learning to support the network is actually a benefit and not a burden when you realize it adds value not sure what else i can say here if someone cant navigate and install a basic open source program they would have to learn that very basic task to start using it,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdFlNb29rQnUydzJ4UThuLWNianVES1E4Mjhjc1RDaEJMMUZSVl9DNHJwZkhjc2RuWWY5bDRva0VtZEpDMjVGcGttaE5kVlpmT3ZjcFUzUGhWeU5FeFJBNzI0X2p1ZGo1dzMtbnY5M3VrbWM9

i dont think its indicative of a bear cycle right now all the other historical indicators for the whole market are showing business as usual for this halving it think and call me naively optimistic if you like that it is a sign of wider adoption for monero all other indicators are showing the same as well wider use across dex and other services the noise around xmr outside xmr specific circles is significantly higher than past market cycles its the coin of choice for grey and black markets and with all this kyc and regulation that cryptocurrency was created in large part to abolish monero is very attractive to those who still hold to the importance of that all in all i see a good year for monero,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbFhwVzk5SDI5RUtnRGlITlhtTXZRN2p4LThqMTl1Rlpzb1ZqdVpHUWhCUTkzZHFNWFJYZVo5bUNZd0pUd1N2VmFBaTlEX01WY09CM2lnVWlDeXJuTGhlcXpXT2Zqd0tNU1ByQkw4cnh0WnM9

i think in the very end there can only be one currencymoney the same way i also think we might eventually all speak the same language very far into the future and a currency that doesnt rely on certainties to audit the actual supply cannot be a serious contender and especially one that has a tail emission which will be worth less and less making it virtually useless to incentive miners which will result in monero being x x x the supply of any other fixed supply currency such as wownero,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaW9YdzhFOGFZYzlJdS1ZLWhYMXdFSWY2WnEwTlk2WC1zSGRsNzlYQUVGQkUwZ1ozc2g5dWhyVW1sbDhseW1LS0V3RzRpejFPRkVoUV9lUjJqczBrSERxcEpZLTd6aU96Mm11eUNGb0p5cXc9

if you believe that the fixed <number> xmr tail emission is too low to incentivize miners how can you also believe that a fixed supply coin would be able to do so if anything shouldnt you be advocating for a fixed inflation rate rather than a fixed supply you are correct that the supply of xmr will eventually exceed x the supply of wow but you forget to mention that this will take more than <number> years to happen that figure doesnt even take into account lost coins or forfeit block rewards also whats stopping you from auditing the xmr supply,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOWZwYmtMWEhDSk5ZM3g5R0F4N2VvV24tTXVtWEFaOFF6Y2xtWmVYSVQ2Uml1UHd6bEJ4dU9Ld2hjM0xheTEwNXdDZEtGUWRNRWg2WG5RellNcHM2SkE9PQ==

you can audit the xmr supply but since information is hidden you rely on cryptographic assumptions you assume its true but you cant know for sure instantly like in bitcoin for instance as for the supply you acknowledge that xmr will be x times the supply of fixed supply coins remaining that alone means it will not retain value as well compared to that other currency and if we all use the same currency its definitely a problem monero is in a competition whether it likes it or not i dont know if a fixed supply coin will be able to survive my point is that it has to rely on fees because the value of the tail emission will trend towards zero there is no choice if the currency is adopted it will rely on fees and it will have succeeded,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaREZXMlNpbzVudG9hVENBUnBkNXRWVFJrVEhiUFN4VExTekpFc0k2NWo4bWdmY3BvVjh1anhTdjdjMExuSTFSNFNmRDR4MmZLdGZUYlRCWXhQMUE3alRjd2M1WEY2MzNLOEw1WlcteFRCOVE9

monero supply can be audited but indirectly heres how the block reward is publicly available add all of them and you get the total amount of xmr ever produced each tx in the blockchain must prove that theyre spending a valid input its a mathematical proof thats been thoroughly reviewed all you have to do now is check if every tx in the blockchain is providing a valid proof or not if theres any invalid tx found anywhere in the blockchian then youve successfully proven that monero is broken if no invalid tx found then you can be certain that theres been no hidden amount of xmr floating around as for tail emissions it may be flawed but the alternative is worse for example btc no tail emission vs doge k per block the block reward of btc is getting lower and lower more homeindividual miners are shutting down their rigs only big mining farms are profitable doge is still profitable to mine at an individual level = more decentralized hash power older btc asics are now nothing more than a expensive brick many older doge asics are still competitive in terms of profitability the onchain tx fee on btc is extremely high in a survey it was found that a huge number of onchain wallets cant even move their funds because of it doge onchain tx fee is way lower with a fixed rate of <number> xmr per <number> min at any given point in time you can know exactly how many xmr will be in supply the market will decide on its price based on that for example doge supply is infinitely more than xmr and thus the market decided its value to be around <number> cents,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN0Z0QWYyak1KNUdnSUtYNEFFd1hkTzc5VGZZQnN3ajlTRUdyNHoydWpoaGx2Y1JUeTI0Rkl6V1lnRGFiaHIzYm9qZk5yRWp5OHI0R0lxNmgxeGY0a3c9PQ==
the opening premise above is off the only time you see a complete monopoly on any currency is when a government mandates it given that cryptocurrencies are highly fungible between each other you pick the one thats right for the job just like any other tool if you need smart contracts use a currency with smart contracts if you want digital cash use monero just like you pick between using cash credit cards and checks as for one language the artificial intelligences or augmented humans that replace us will know all languages you may be right on the one language thing because theyll just start speaking to each other in a mashup of all languages if they want to be specific about snow theyll use an eskimo word ,r/monero,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacWdlS2NpTjE5Q2tvZ1ZxUlIycVV5c2hVdXRLTjhPMUNpWmlfMmFmcThrcU1MeWYwa3p1TzFQRHpKTFJEQnNjQzFKalRyUGhNM3lNTkl6ZzBtdWJMMEE9PQ==
