<url> please read this it explains it very well ive spent the last <number> months researching this as ive fallen victim thank goodness i am a scientist traditional smart dust is copper based i sent some samples to a testing centre and they found no indication of metal and was all carbon based initially i was shut down but i have been documenting my experiences and collecting evidence that i continued my research and found newer and more efficient graphene based nano material graphene is <number> carbon i started doing research to see if an mri could detect smart dust the link ive provided explains how smart dust is way too small to be detected that way and because of the nature of its backscatter communication impossible to detect with regular rf detector note smart dust uses rf emf for communication it has to be detected using harmonic or ultra wide radar aka khz ive been victim of sexual harassment with this stuff its real and those that do not agree just dont know how to research or have not experienced it and wouldnt even know where to begin i am a research scientist and have read hundreds of papers and its taken me months to narrow down my searches to find answers if you want to know more about graphene based nanotechnology <url> its a great summary just available on wikipedia as soon as i knew to search graphene based smart dust the research was readily available it speaks to sensors smart dust etc anything youre experiencing theres an explanation for it here use this as a precursor to doing your own peer reviewed research i am so sorry for all those who have gone through this or something similar,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSVc2SGNaUkhJUlBibzNWSUFnalpEdUZCM01OUnBleERXalI3TU1hdjMxUVU2R3NBN2hROUgtMV9ITk1OUDM3TXc1THZXR2F6a1c2S18xLWJENjFlSEE9PQ==

is graphene durable enough to survive prolonged intense contact with a material i wouldve thought it would simply break down quite quickly suffering tears how do you intend to utilise the graphene are you planning to use the edge of a sheet as your cutting blade to utilise the monolayer thickness or are you planning to utilise multiple sheets layered on top of each other the edge of your graphene will not be completely smooth either youll have loose strands of bonded carbon here and there this might affect your cutting quality at the nano scale at least for the first few uses i would guess graphene would bring benefits in heat resistance and if i am wrong about the wear and tear factor could be a valid method of cutting at the nano scale i think using multiple layers stacked would be the best way to start possibly removing one layer after each successful test until you find the sweet spot im just a soon to be fourth year nano student at university so by no means a professional i would just like to know your thoughts on this,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSjJLUkxaWmI5MzNZTHpZbmk1eVhack5ZLWhvaENTVzZUbkFWSDByVWNuaDFFaE1pMUY4QmJVUTBBdDNESWtYNWNsNkhhRWRnOWxxemZ1ekRuanVhZVFsZ0tLRXlxY2xjQ2F0ZDJrYkpTRU09
my initial idea was to use the edge of a single graphene sheet due to its atomic thickness which would theoretically allow for extremely precise cuts i believe that for certain methods a sheet made up of multiple layers of graphene could be ideal for increased durability however a single layer allows for more precise cuts especially in applications such as graphene production where the goal is to cut individual layers of atoms for precision cutting at the nanoscale such as the production of monolayer graphene i believe a single layer sheet would be more suitable this is because a single layer can minimize interference and provide cleaner more defined cuts my idea is based on the fact that a single layer of graphene only has covalent bonds which allows for cutting weaker bonds with precision to solve the problem of loose carbon strands a good approach would be to apply tension which would theoretically act as a very tight line keeping the graphene edge smoother and more efficient,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWUZXSFdLYjVSOG9rcDZ0eGw0Xy00TTU1d0xqbG9mR2JhcElCNkRtYXhBakVFT3Z6Z0ZOa3RIZjlFb29qRFpJYzM4OFgtUlJTbVpNa0ZaSTJFUXdQQWc9PQ==

thankyou for your reply it sounds like a promising experiment are you planning to hold the sheet down between two rapidly spinning plates like a nano scale diamond tipped saw blade or use it as a wire and move it back and forth in a hand saw like motion or something else i wish you good luck whichever way you go with it,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOUxZd0tDaHNQc2IwMVpJZ3hfZHQzM0FDdUJPb05SS096am44ZUR2c1ViLTZZTnJ2VUN2YXRjd2Vlem1SMmlGLWQ3T1lOQ3pMSWxBUVR0bXRuZGtIVlRkb1ZxVzYtM2h6VG1PM2tXUDdwMG89
exactly i still plan to do some testing i dont know exactly what the shape of the blade will be i have the idea of serrulating it using laser pulses on a nanoscale since the serrated tip will have a very small width we can remove it with the same technology as the wear occurs and serrate it again initially i planned to use highspeed movements in horizontal directions to make the cuts i really appreciate your comment i would like you to give me some of your thoughts have you thought of any ideas that could help me,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWGNfTTV2TVZNRUFSdW9VVzZ0Tzk0MEN3WVlURXdnOGt3ZnpBbkhjSGpicTZmaG1pR3ZNVkFvLVNDUDRRaFYyVm9zN01BVUVtcTk3aVNnbE50Umhta2c9PQ==
no problem i was thinking about two possible ways of testing it out one is wedging the monolayer between small blocks of metal with hyper smooth surfaces to promote adhesion between the graphene and the blocks this should help keep the graphene sheet steady between the blocks after which attach a motor to the blocks for the cutting motion like a small scale version of this maybe <url> the other is to take the already established saw blade and replace the edge with the monolayer and see how that goes for testing hell if this works i could even see you taking the concept and applying it to a carbon nanotube drill or something those are my thoughts anyway i hope ive helped in anyway good luck with your project,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcjg2aWtZc1BWT0FkNkRtcktYRWFKOTBUODd6VnljZzdzTHhTMExOSFZUX292eWpKN0MtWXBSSFJXUExWb0pMaVR5U2RfOGtrbmNCTDhoUWZXZmJwRXpJNkVpNmQzdm9hX3NNekpWdmUyUDA9
in my experience with graphene it behaves like a sheet of paper at the nanoscale it might be technically strong but tears very easily and is definitely not something i would describe as being stiff,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ3RQLUdacnhxM0NEQndYdTBKbGRqRmJ6Mk9faVI0eVNOWGVDQk1hdzY3VlR3V0U2ZTl0aDR3TXFNMjZnZ2pHZjB3OUVTODNuZTB2SzZ4SnZabjFqT013NUpEUkpEdy1vVmVEUUtHa2Jiazg9
i understand your concerns about graphenes strength and rigidity here are a few points that may help explain how graphene could be a viable tool for nanoscale cutting <number> atomic thickness graphene is composed of a single layer of carbon atoms which gives it an extremely thin thickness on the order of one atom thick this allows for precise cutting at nanoscales where other tools may be limited by the thickness of their materials <number> high tensile strength despite its fragile appearance graphene is incredibly strong it has a tensile strength much higher than that of steel for example which makes it capable of withstanding considerable forces during cutting without significantly deforming <number> heat conduction graphene has excellent thermal conductivity which means it can dissipate the heat generated during cutting efficiently this is crucial in nanoscale cutting operations where precise temperature control is essential to avoid damage to samples or materials <number> structural flexibility graphenes hexagonal structure gives it a unique flexibility easily adapting to irregular shapes and surfaces during cutting this is advantageous in applications where conformity to complex geometries is required <number> potential for atomic manipulation due to its precise atomic structure and ability to precisely cut covalent bonds graphene can be used for atomic manipulation at the nanoscale enabling extremely precise and controlled cuts these points highlight how graphene not only addresses the challenges of perceived brittleness but also offers unique characteristics that make it a promising tool for nanoscale cutting operations i would like to hear more about your experience and your perspectives on the potential of graphene in this context,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWHROVEZwOV9WWlN0bXRyRi12em5wdF9maHZFcVVuUHVEYTBfVndjaEYzeGltTUZjeko4a2J2cmlkdGtGVnlKeERiNVBQU094d3VNSHlWVXk0SkNrZ0E9PQ==
i also thought about exploring the idea of using graphene as a rotating blade but i dont think its the best approach to achieve my project goals however its an amazing idea that could be applied in other areas as mentioned by casanathaplants graphene can be as delicate and fragile as paper so it would be necessary to consider using multiple layers of graphene on top of each other to deal with wear and tear after all changing the graphene blade every millisecond doesnt seem like an ideal solution kkkkkkkkkk,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUkZmQTdON2NLOHA0ZTFkRE9rTGFWWWhNWlJuQzhlYmFqUmFTRWtGTG9wcW1zRHFfd05Vc2U3ZEJxNGRYN1NIQTh2ZlZDVEk4NjhrckVteENBX2d3T1E9PQ==

its possible you could reinforce the center with a different material thats thicker and more durable perhaps thats what i had in mind with the <number> plates surrounding the graphene you most likely are going to need multiple layers to increase its durability regardless but you arent really sacrificing much in the way of precision given each layer is only an atom thick your serration idea could work here if you separate the graphene into smaller increments around the edge of a premade saw blade with a dulled edge smaller areas of graphene are less prone to wear and tear i would assume anyways ultimately i think multiple layers of graphene sandwiched between two reinforcing plates might be your best bet initially at least in my opinion but i wouldnt be surprised if there is a better method you come up with edit you could possibly attach the stretched out reinforced graphene to a piston or a piston adjacent device for a handsaw like motion,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbzFLbUpzRElVWWFjejJwTXA3Q2ZjNDlHRVlfSWtVTUFERUlCTmR5SUdRcWRfaHJvV1pSOTI5QlJzallsbmhwZVotTFpqajhUQndfelJySzZMcVZvMHgwY2hXWnBseklWd1ZLcllSaWEybEk9

ha i just had to ask im a nanotechnologist and my phd was very graphene heavy a few thousand hours in fabricating manipulating and analyzing graphene and other d materials the flexibility and thermal properties are the only advantages i can endorse from this list not familiar with work on using graphene to cut covalent bonds in a mechanical sense perhaps you can link some papers youve found on the topic its possible i suppose that graphene could be used to cut something like how you could use a sheet of paper to cut a watermelon if only you held it very firmly close to the cutting edge to prevent it from bending but the advantage of doing so as opposed to another material isnt obvious to me yes its atomically thin but we can also make atomically sharp cutting edges as well or use other cutting methods fib or something,r/nanotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYUwzQUN5SmFRY2Exblc0LXlLbEh5S2FJdWphQUtVbVd2eC16YUo5T0dUNWNKakZtTkROWGo1RG96RE5MSGJqU29WWU1TaTlRMFNBV2FkVjBvZTdlZTRwekNrVDJJaWFmQi1iMENkbUF2RVk9
