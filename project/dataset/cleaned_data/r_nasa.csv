the only reason they mentioned a rescue mission is because they were asked about it i think someone from wall street journal asked and brought up sending a dragon to rescue them i wish more people would at least avoid omitting important details this is why i listened and watched the test flight status conference so that i could be a bit more informed for better context and understanding,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZVMtS0NXYjNjdm5MV1UxaDAydWl2c0hjdnFhRVBqTW1hSnJWSmY4Si0zYWtFalp6d2ZmRTA5SnNXUFp6QlQ3ZjQ2NnBIdThpY0R5TG1ja0FHZ3Rkcnc9PQ==

the fact that nasa is even dusting off plans for a rescue mission is the surprising part to me i have been extremely critical of boeing overall and disappointed in their management of starliner but i never thought their extended stay was due to anything other than a desire to get more data now it seems like there are at least some concerns on the viability of starliner to safely return which is completely contradictory to the messaging previously released,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYT29MZ2ZHcXJwWHNhUS00Wjl0dTlEdEFiRlQtYlA1QnB2RE82b0gzcEdNelNZelVyM0piOEhRU0kzRnRpZ1E3ei02VmZ6Y0RsYVY5Mmw0a19CdlpoelYtM0R3WmZOU1RyYVZqa1FoaVVrR2s9

not necessarily these are redundant systems in part for insurance for situations exactly like this consider that were still using hubble even with the majority of its monoprop thrusters being out of fuel also cassini part of its attitude control and flight controllers were able to work around the issues no doubt they really want all of these working reliably which is why they are trying to understand the issue before burning it up in the atmosphere,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTmFTM1BSWElOZ0FGenpxX3p3d1R2N1g5VFh5T0hPd3JnOFo3MlV1eG5ZaGVXT3BuS1ZUUFNqSFVWcWEtUkQxSWU4aldQdmdiOG9Kd1A4ZWItWVZFRWc9PQ==

i mention an authority figure as we have a fundamental disagreement as to whether my and your position is randomly selected a mathematician could come in and say definitely which of us misunderstands and why which is my appeal to an authority my claim is that since we are performing the thought experiment after we have been born and can only perform the thought experiment having already been born at our current time we are not a random sample the lottery winner as example was my attempt to illustrate that having been born at a specific time we can gain no knowledge about the other specific if humanity persists the universe would self segregate the lottery winners into a little box where they cant see the countless other losers those born later than us when humanity was significantly larger due to the nature of not being able to see the future the nature of your claim can be applied to any situation no matter how likely to extinction to humanity <number> or <number> which means we can derive no information on it one of us is wrong i believe its you you believe its me without a specific example to point to as to why and not just using our own reasoning which ones is flawed we are at an impasse and the conversation wont progress,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYnN3QUdReGFsdmV4dDdTT3JyTWZFd3kxVzVLYnJXTU9hYXQ0cXZKeEltdkNZUFQzdkFtb2hKdElRWlhWdFZxdWtFY1ZvR2RrYVBVbjR5MUd5OFA0ZXc9PQ==

im not saying i have the answers but everything i read said we only went once so at the very least we can acknowledge that none of the other missions were related to the moon or at the very least the ones that were related had failed which the latter would be indicative of the impossibility of the original landing like i said i was thoroughly convinced it was real until this thread and a couple of others gave me pause to doubt it and its not the people saying its fake that makes me question the landing because most of the time theyre clearly a bit whacked out its the people saying its real that im finding extremely sketchy all of the information is the exact same which by itself would make me trust the information but then theres just a bunch of things that relies entirely on convenience or suspension of disbelief tldr everyone saying its fake sounds like a whack job but everyone saying its real leave glaring holes in their evidence i went from wholly convinced to suspicious,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMDU3TU1lcllucVZraTdxVlBtSFVCZlgzSjdvVWtFZVZPanRtdVpQaGwxTmRMMGlrbXdyTDdqZHBKZ2JWS0dCT19aZjVVRlhmYUlkUzRMVGQ1MzFQX3c9PQ==

hi this is karen hal lodens daughter and javenbonzs aunt first of all i have to say i am blown away by the kind words said for the man i simply know as dad he is everything that you have described and so much more kind loving giving not presumptuous and most of all humble i grew up thinking that my dad had a job just like all of my friends dads which is partially true since i grew up in the nasa community he went to work in the morning and was home by dinner time every now and then he came home for lunch which was an extra treat i have memories of my mom packing my brothers and me up in the family station wagonin our pajamasto go watch dad at work i remember sitting in a dark room with stadium like seating peering through a window and having to be extra quiet because dad was working looking back on those times i now know that we were in the viewing room during a mission of mission control wow at the time of apollo <number> i was only <number> <number><number> years old i of course didnt realize then the impact my dad had on the history made that july of <number> as i grew older i knew that my dad played a significant part in his job at nasa but i actually didnt fully realize how much until july of <number> in july of <number> the th anniversary of the apollo <number> lunar landing was celebrated my dad was an honored guest of this celebration because of his role in mission control my brothers and i along with our spouses and children were there for the weekend long celebration at our childhood home mom and dad pulled out all of the memorabilia dad had accumulated during his service at nasa for us to look at i was blown away by the things my dad had from his nasa days it was only then that i truly realized the impact my dad and many others like him had made in the advance of space exploration today my parents are living their dream retirement life dad is still very humble and will tell you he was just doing his job back in the late <number>s as his daughter i couldnt be more proud of the man he is not just because of his contributions he made to space exploration but because of the man of integrity that he was and still is to this very day he is and will always be my hero,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabUo0LXNTQWk2cVVlaTRGZklOb3lxYl9xYVVJdXc5eUtWSGQ5WGxvWVN4NDNJTTA3SnFfVEdfb2RVN2VoSjdhNmV3VGx6WV9NNWk0Z2VvZjA5ZEVzS0E9PQ==

spinning at a rate synchronous with the orbital period around its star is exactly right but it actually isnt as rare as it might seem because it isnt a random occurrence orbiting bodies are tidally compressed and deformed by their orbital partners and when the rotation of the body does not match the orbital period this causes the deformations to process around the body the heat generated from this deformation comes from the rotational energy of the body and slows its rotation until they are locked in the case of a body that is rotating more slowly than its orbital period the mismatch will drag it up to speed until they are locked this time taking energy from the orbital system slightly lowering the orbits distance to loan the rotational energy it takes a long time for these changes to occur the earth is very slowly slowing its rotation for this reason and you are likely familiar with our own tidally locked partner luna,r/nasa,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQWNXeHRLNC1fVHhCaHVqZjAxanc5VzdtVEdCZlZEQkhrVjBpa0J3STktLWFwUjZvdzRYd2hKX21acTdzeWhLQUNtemNRLWRtUG5OWlBwbUhLaVRnRXc9PQ==
