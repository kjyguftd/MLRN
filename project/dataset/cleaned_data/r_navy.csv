well you are asking the right questions early like the others said taps will cover many things taps had me set up an appointment with a dav disabled american veterans volunteer organization vso veterans services officer and she was able to mark all the things in my medical record that deemed va disability worthy also if you have trouble sleeping get an appointment with an approved sleep study specialist there will also be a va physical and mental evaluation a <number> or <number> is better than nothing believe me on that as for gi bill you should look into the many gi approved education programs some people go through <number> years of college and have a career that a certification can cover careers that come to mind include several types of technicians computer programmers and several supervisory and managerial positions if you need to get into a career quicker to take care of your family certifications may be the way to go the gi bill will also cover many schools for high end trades i did what taps recommended and got awarded <number> by the va it took <number><number> months to receive it after getting out i did have a rough <number> months in between getting out and starting school i do recommend you save as much as you can so that you have some buffer money i went to college for a couple years but realized it wasnt the career i wanted and quit i took the week long basic maritime safety course and some other short courses gi bill covered and quickly got a job working in the gulf of mexico on offshore supply vessels the pay was pretty good entry level at the time <number> years later i qualified to test for my engine officer rd assistant engineers license i also had to take a couple engineering officer classes that the gi bill will cover around the same time an instructor who was retired navy and i started talking about the va he told me to reapply for an increase i am glad i did because they awarded me <number> pt with this type of rating you can still work i left the gulf of mexico soon after that and now i am working deep sea vessels with a union and living in thailand the va has been a blessing for me the entire way what is your rate if you dont mind me asking,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcDNJLVF4UDlaZWoyZXFBTURiTHppQmxJU0ZQMHpuLXluYnFyMzdKbTFRbFdQSnpBQUJ3dTZPc1Q5Y2tzZmlsWjdSbHZ4WFRRMHdFdTNkU1lTMUlOcjB3anZhWWdCa3M4UVRuYi1JeTR4WTg9
braces need to be periodically adjusted to make sure the teeth are lining up correctly they are also vulnerable to breaking and may need to be repaired the navy does not have orthodontists on ships imagine youre on a six month deployment with braces who is going to adjust them or repair them not just any dental tech can handle it and special equipment is required since braces often need to be worn for years puttting someone on limdu until their braces come off is impractical finally braces are often for cosmetic purposes the navy is not going to pay forauthorize a procedure that renders you nondeployable for years just so your smile is straighter the navy does take dental health seriously which is why they mandate getting check ups and annual cleanings that is separate from orthodontics which makes you more vulnerable to having an issue on deployment not less,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdnBCZF8tLU96cGZlclRGZzRtWnVrc05MNEo5ZjZ4R0dPZE42R0lONUg2MjVwZGdCQkwyM3ZXRkNLOURNeEZuYlhaQW5rdjJORjVnQmNwdnlBQTQteWlCOXRTYXEzb0lSRnctU19ZOHpNVEU9
so theres a lot to unpack here first off not every navy dentist is credentialed to install braces to tack onto this most dentists dont want to fuck with braces anyway thats the job of the orthodontist orthodontists are way too valuable to be sending out and are kept shoreside unless theyre deliberately deployed these are professionals the navy desperately wants to retain which involves not pissing them off because theyre expensive to recruit and replace secondly its not just the dentist or orthodontist youre sending out but their support staff as well dentists have to have x number of dentaltrained hms with them and this isnt something you slapdash train folks on its a c school certification now take into account what your new tiny dental department on board needs to function space for records space for sterilizing equipment xray equipment and a place to bolt down a dental chair what do we need all this junk for stuff goes wrong occasionally with braces like broken teeth personnel + equipment + maintenance for that equipment = more money than the navy wants to spend braces at sea is overly costly at best and illadvised at worst,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV0t0bnNDSVU3ZzBQN3gzNHhQa0RibTlNVGswUEo5RWljVFp5TXNMcUp0dDRrSnBpVGVMTEgtMWxteTBTMEVfVjlEaU5rdk1uSS16RDFRdnVjcUZ3bFE9PQ==

first im sorry that youve been going through all of this im going to take what you wrote at face value however due to the complexity of everything youre explaining please know that there is likely a ton of nuance to your situation and whavetever people respond here maymay not be relevant that said im going to be straightforward > my provider was not helpful she didnt believe that i was raped and said at worse i was just fondled im sorry you were not believed im not sure who would think it was appropriate to make this distinction aside from the er as it pertained to an exam or legal as it pertained to charges regardless supporting you should have been a primary goal >i tried to tell her i was depressed but she said i wasnt and that i need to get over it this is where some technicalities may have arisen i dont know youthe circumstances etc and when it comes to mental health there are criteria that need to be met for a diagnosis if you feel youre not being correctly diagnosed you can request a second opinion > she also said that im not right for the navy if im already depressed finally i had had enough out of context ie for the typical sailor in a school this could be true sounds like given your situation probably not but if as you said prior they didnt believe you met other criteria thats how they could have arrived at that decision im not saying thats the correct decision just what may have been their logic > i startes talking to a civilian doctor on doctors on demand he diagnosed me with depression and ptsd from my rape he also tested me for adhd and autism level <number> autism he prescribed my some antidepressants youve lost me here this is where the clinician you were seeing may make a difference a therapist is almost never able to prescribe medication in a few states with additional training and theyre limited in what they can prescribe a prescriber psychiatrist psych np etc is almost never going to test for anything because that isnt part of their training however they are qualified to diagnose these disorders i would be surprised if the disorders youve listed were all diagnosed a during the sameor very few visits as again face value if you meet criteria for ptsd it can be hard to parse out other diagnosis due to symptom overlap without a longer period of treatment this is partially why military providers are skeptical of civilian diagnosis >so i went back to my provider at medical and she find let me get evaluated i told the doctor about my rape and how i have gone downhill since she diagnosed me with unspecified personality disorder with anti social features she wrote in her notes that i was a liar who lies to get ahead i get recommended for separation what was involved in this diagnosis at this point given everything going on id imagine they did testing with you as well if so they should have gone over the testing report with you >i finally snap and try to kill myself and get sent to a psych ward at the psych ward i was diagnosed with mdd major depressive disorder i was given meds that worked subjectively im sorry you felt like that was the only option i hope youre in a better place and building up supports as it sounds like whatever direction this goes may be challenging objectively again just being straight this can be viewed as further evidence of a personality disorder >im still being separated for a personality disorder that two different doctors dont believe i have was the inpatient stay at a military facility or civilian the doctors on demand diagnosis wont hold much weight but if the inpatient stay was military andor has good notes if those arent in your medical record go get them give them to medical records to scan into your chart you can try getting your records from doctors on demand and doing the same idk what their process is >i was told that they would begin the process monday abd there is no appeal i was told this would be a cnd discharge again face value this is somewhat true if medical starts the cnd that recommendation and your medical record are reviewed by <number> sometimes <number> independent providers so the system has a built in review you could also request a second opinion if you have not yet done that cnd isnt a discharge status if all of the providers agree and the cnd is approved it moves to your co for action they can decline to take action or separate if they separate they decide the discharge status so to review <number> <number> providers review the record provider who met with you <number> <number> and then the co reviews by the end of the <number> + co if they all agree co determines how you get out >i feel like a fool i feel betrayed and i feel like i should have never reported i feel like this is only happening because i reported my rape and sought help for my depression i feel like a loser and i dont want to be separated since being on the antidepressants i feel better my command says im better but im still being separated for a lie hang in there im not sure whats going on but im glad the antidepressants are helping and youre doing alright right now please continue asking forgetting the support you need >i get no benefits with a cnd discharge this is untrue benefits are determined based upon discharge status and service connection veterans always receive mental health care for a sexual trauma and i want to say the va has now extended mental health to everyone point being if this is the most distressing part for you ask someone who is knowledgeable andor look on the vas website for informed info >i also have reached out to my victims advocate and he got me in contact with the vlc who set up a meeting with the co but one of my chiefs said there is no use in speaking to the co this is the direction to go followup with the vlc dont listen to your chief instruction changes often and they maymay not have any clue what the instructions says and is going off of sea stories without context >i also have a lawyer and my family is trying to get me a civilian lawyer too theres a point where having lawyers is overkill id argue <number> would be that point especially if you have to pay out of pocket and find someone who knows the ucmj and adsep processes while i cant advise on that id ask the other <number> lawyers you have what they think no use wasting money and complicating things if you dont have

your vlc should understand the policies of a cnd adsep such as electing gcmca review and the elevated separation authority if youre being separated within a year of your assault they can help you with a statement to the separation authority who is going to review your case the best thing you can do right now is try to take care of yourself and kick ass at your job,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaWdoU3BlZi04dXJCZjNpMHFLaGNBT2ZQeTBzSHBqMXNpeHhTTEpScFdwRGNVbVluNVNraGY0U2daVmVNc2V6Y2wtZHBXR0pfLVRuTkxJaFZ6UGlwSnNhMllIUmNOMk9GUWFPeWt1elR1d0E9

first im so sorry this has happened to you i cant even imagine the stress and anxiety this is putting you through couple thoughts talk to your co whats the worst they can do kick you out youre already being pushed out imo talking with the co will either help things at best or at worst nothing changes i dont see a downside to talking to the co also ask your civilian attorney about talking to a navy jag for advice this is free and possibly reporting it to requesting ncis to investigate the medical situation a navy jag should be a lot more familiar with the way the navy syatem works but since you already have an attorney you need to talk to them first,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQWh5SXhjZ3FzWmFQU1FocnB1VFFOX1M3dXVObU5XOTBaY01fa3pNNzdBUTJwdmVFbGVMX19qdXB0VEJ0Y0R4SDBGOFduel9hSDFfWnlxdDVDb28xcXc9PQ==

so currently recruiting right now on the west coast heres what ill say i was on sea duty for <number> <number><number> years <number> deployments including a covid cruise you have your positives negatives positives when you see your future sailors become better people better leaders it really touches your soul i have enjoyed giving advice to my people and seeing them be better for it finding a community like i have and people that you know are on the fence of going into gangs being into drugs and helping them get their life back on track that is the stuff that makes it worth it i also have at least been able to come home to my wife dog every day yes late days some really late days but at least i get to see them every day so ill take that vs being on deployment also if you stay in it looks fantastic on your record i had a real close friend who got a p eval as a first class over here submit his package and get picked up for chief so if you survive oh baby it will look fantastic even if you are getting out you have a lot of opportunity for networking with people that will set you up nicely when you are out negatives remember when i said if you survive that if is no shit legit if there will be moments where you look up and ask yourself if this is truly real life i have seen situations that have quite literally made me vomit you also deal with leadership that ill say <number><number> times is at the very best questionable i have tried going to online college and i am not giving up but working <number><number> hours per week probably <number><number> of those hours driving coming home playing husband and dog father and then making sure all your future sailors are gtg all while trying to get some sort of sleep is so hard the most difficult part is your first year though i am not from the west coast so i had to establish relationships find what my niche is i for one take a lot of pride in everything i did in my rate be able to pickup on it relatively quickly i didnt pick up my niche until the very end of my first year so the growing pains and the constant push it was very difficult for me in conclusion while recruiting even today has its challenges for me and looking back at everything that happened i will always be of the mindset that everything happens for a reason i have about a year to go and can tell you that i now have the confidence that i can do every job imaginable so if you are up for a challenge and think you can handle it with all that i have said by all means give it a go,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabnV6M3hWcVdzS1J0U3VFMFdZVjRUWWNDUnA5SmY0ckF6a1hER1B5cm1IeEJVc2d1d0E4OW53dWFkaWVtZGJ6SDZYUUZQVmhieHlBV0JkN1F5T0RxeUlYNnotb1JJQXpmeFVDUkdabWFiQTA9

the shopping cart theory source chan the shopping cart is the ultimate litmus test for whether a person is capable of selfgoverning to return the shopping cart is an easy convenient task and one which we all recognize as the correct appropriate thing to do to return the shopping cart is objectively right there are no situations other than dire emergencies in which a person is not able to return their cart simultaneously it is not illegal to abandon your shopping cart therefore the shopping cart presents itself as the apex example of whether a person will do what is right without being forced to do it no one will punish you for not returning the shopping cart no one will fine you or kill you for not returning the shopping cart you gain nothing by returning the shopping cart you must return the shopping cart out of the goodness of your own heart you must return the shopping cart because it is the right thing to do because it is correct a person who is unable to do this is no better than an animal an absolute savage who can only be made to do what is right by threatening them with a law and the force that stands behind it the shopping cart is what determines whether a person is a good or bad member of society,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVDFGb2FZT0NTR1VTQ3FaVFJlUENOMTZrSVlZWC16bEdWWTJFOHdjZktyRmdQZDVSX2MtVzNsXzM5TlgzV19Nb255WDRHRldrLVBSWUxLOFZjN01hRmc9PQ==

well i think you be surprised all the bad shit social workers been through to want to work in such a dark field you got human trafficking victims veterans child youth protective services having to protect children from being exploited and abused working with people incarcerated or mentally unstable people and having to work with all different kinds of people i think sometimes you need someone who is a little tough to have to deal with such dark topic that most people dont have to deal with on a daily basis regular people dont understand what its like to walk around in a world where you seen the darkest parts of human nature and what people are capable of being and i think having that kind of understanding and acceptance that other people arent going to understand where dark humor comes from is what i think can make a difference because we dont always need a shiny person who is always happy and cheerful we need people who are realistic enough to tell their clients there are going to be shitty days where you are going to have ptsd and you arent going to alway feel like youre old self and that its ok if you feel a little fucked up because you been through shit and have someone who knows and understands that concept is what matters because there are many people who feel exactly the same way and they dont have anyone to relate to them i think that why people should be hiring social workers in all kinds of different backgrounds from all walks of life because they have the skills to work in the community and problem solve world problems there just isnt much respect for social workers and what they could be capable of doing if they had better support and back up from the government to help and support people we have a crisis for veterans and we dont need to have a bunch of executive making decisions about veterans when they have never served in the military or done anything to help the veterans,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZUl3Y3B2YVQwa3V3TWs4NDZjbmNub3YzQVg5Uzk4Q1lzTy1xcUpiRUVYQ0I1QmdtWU5FYUQ0clhzWUVKZVJKV2psZ0MwU2JjTVhSd21uMXVDZm5acjVHVW05djl1UGZxV1RqT2NrNHJYb1k9

hot take your sailors arent struggling with motivation youre struggling to connect with them my guess is that youre motivated by the act of service many in my experience most sailors dont even rank that in the top five you have to work with your people to figure out what motivates them sometimes they know what that is sometimes they dont sometimes motivations change sometimes people are motivated by things you just cant wrap your head around ive found that for a wide variety of reasons my sailors arent often motivated by the same things i am finding a way to bridge that gap is the most important task for a leader its cool that you take pride in the service to country aspect of the job but that shouldnt mean everyone else has to share that with you,r/navy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSjFaVXpnWC1vVzN3a2dyOU5RUHoxc19mZWtGX0RFX3l0Z212Y1lHWmdZeFV5b0RfTjlkcTRWSGJmSmRLVzU5OUdIWjR1UGhvLTZyeUNiczJUM3RKZlE9PQ==
