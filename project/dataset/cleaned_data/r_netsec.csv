its not enough for a function to just be reentrant eg using thread local static variables because a signal can interrupt the function while its running eg lets assume syslog was implemented with a kib threadlocal buffer for formatting the string and a signal arrived while syslog is executing unless the signal is masked it will interrupt the thread,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVXZkR0VrVFEwYnRzenpUUjY3OV9RaGhDdl93R0hwZERidkM5ZXBrSlByNzZ4dXNBWVhMOGRrQlNxZVpjLWI3bEVuQ2tCS1FQNmpBT3dXRGVzUGMzS29OcGt6cnlaRzBzeGdXWURkcFdxd0U9

tbh ive always found this technique to be a bit overrated effectively this is exactly the same thing as writing an elf executable into devshm executing itloading it and then unlinking it except this solution is less portable as it can only be used in systems with a libc that supports memfdcreate if you are using this technique to execute a capability via execv a defender or another actor on the system can still easily recover your tool by simply reading the symlink in proc<pid>exe or proc<pid>fd additionally it stands out pretty badly if someone looks into proc,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOZ1o3ZGZoQWZOUW1UakhNLWdtOFozcFZVemVrSkIxVDkxb1NERTQ4eGE3ajZvLXF3ZGN5TXhwb3B1cV9LNEhqdE5fMTgxbUFldmxYU3VnbWhoMFhsMnc9PQ==

my use case was mostly running elfs in embedded devices such as routers which did not have devshm mounted which even then is oftentimes mounted noexec nor any writable mounts > except this solution is less portable as it can only be used in systems with a libc that supports memfdcreate this tool generates code that calls the syscalls directly on target langs where this is possible you can also optionally use libc to not hardcode the syscall number but its not required youre not wrong about reading the elf from proc<pid>exe but as a note that does require root to do,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOVFFUbmk0emZ3NzEyZDQwNHAxeUY1dUpYdWlIanpsQVNwTDZ2azV3U2NERU82eldaR19IbGQyX3BQQkJlYmVncmtxMWFBNWZQdVItRFpMSUVNNEpyV1E9PQ==

sometimes after they use fuzzers to try to find bugs an inexperienced user is able to miss an entire forest because they are busy gazing at a few trees that were found by a fuzzer for example some people see a crash found by a fuzzer and fix the code at exactly the point where it is crashing instead of figuring out if there is some other point where it should be fixed this is wrong a lot of the time as can easily hide conceptual issues in a crashy program obviously the error lies not with the fuzzing in these cases,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNzE0LVg0UUlfMW5lX2ZvcGZHS3cxaHJkOGstM0VRTklKNXdHdUl6OTE4ZzRnd1ZPelFjekx6WDRKX1RWSmttdzUwT1Y3eFZoR09GLXlXaXZDOUdXTlZzS3FuNXJaci0zQlZPS1I3Y19LZUk9

this is not bad but there are a few points i would add accesscontrolalloworigin of prevents cookies from going up it is an unfortunately too common mistake that websites might reflect the origin from the browser host header rather than using the wildcard case which is safer than reflecting the origin there are some unfortunate libraries that have had the reflected origin vulnerability gorillahandlers being one the end section about using custom headers to prevent get requests from changing state the better option is to not allow get requests to change state rather than doing bandaid patches with custom headers get requests are not supposed to be state changing the statement at the beginning is wrong but thankfully this scenario will not happen and its all thanks to cors no its due to the same origin policy cors is not a security feature instead cors is a relaxation of the builtin same origin policy cors reduces security to allow functionality that the same origin policy would otherwise prohibit the trick with cors is to make sure you dont reduce it too much and the most dangerous scenario is reflecting origins with accesscontrolallowcredentials set to true,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXUVBBRVVyU1FQSjhPMkQxeUh0NWJsSHZnSkdGQjExQUlHdGZ0QXNJck5oTzJtczVtenMxanNMMHlsbVFuRUU3Q2lFNU1DUEQySnA1SUFta3VRTWNmdVE9PQ==

im not sure how to feel about this first of all it serves as an exmaple why you should never copy or paste any credentials into your source code never not for testing not for internal projects never if you really have to read them from some ephemeral place like outside credential files env vars stdin or inject them with a http proxy also one of the takeaways seems wrong github decided to only allow new tokens to be scoped to projects but these tokens have to expire you cant set them to never expire im not going to replace <number> tokens every week this is the equivalent of forcing users to change their password every month its not going to happen no one is going to replace their ci tokens every month or so so actually this token could indeed have limited access if github would allow to disable token expiry for new tokens but those are nuances i dont realistically see how this could have been prevented being more restrictive with access tokens doesnt make it impossible to leak them by accident you do have to interface with external apis and there is no way to test these interactions without puttin in real tokens at some point,r/netsec,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRVB5VUUtZ3NEaU5rdHB0OG9yZTRFVFZUcWdlOGliQjREQ3p1bGxKQUxJaU1pV0hoTndOeEt0RTl5UVZzSFF4VUJoLTU2VmZjNm5jQjE3Q0FLd0VUemc9PQ==
