> braingate the nearest competitor used surface electrode grids precisely because they could not find a way to emplace electrodes deep into the brain without damaging the blood vessels and neurons setting aside any argument that braingate is the closest competitor id like to point out that the cerebral cortex has always been the target for this sort of application and that the cortex is only a few millimeter thick utah arrays reach just fine neuralinks an advance its helping get this tech into the market its not a quantum leap the biggest differences are the funding and public acceptance,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZG1pd0FXWk1NTXZ2N0lQZElzclhtNVAyc04tZWIzbENkVElnVkpWZG1CaW9MNFpuZTQ0YWYtSWZZcnRmeXB4Sl9aUUN1NVJDMFpJdnpROGkzX1Z5SUE9PQ==

>sounds like the surgeon does not understand how it works and is guessing based on his prior knowledge and not understanding that this is something entirely new afaik everything neuralink does was already possible using utah arrays the only significant improvement is the implantation method and the materials which are intended to reduce scarringbiofouling utah arrays are literally just a grid of spikes shoved into your brain after all but theyve been around a long time and can get the same quality data until their function degrades from scarring and biofouling idk this guys background but being a neuroscientist doesnt necessarily mean he knows anything about modern bci or the history of bci,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZFJjMEg3S0d6Nnh0M0lJZUY2UXJXc2RadWxFV0FOYVhUTWlpYkZrU2h0UDVIbzVMWmRfbzJycm1DZVB2ajB0dlhWODNYUmN5S1JpcXZUejdsQ191N1lpOGZuT19Qa0RkNnBEY1JTcGwwX2M9
why does his comment set you off hes right that neuralink hasnt pushed the boundaries of what we could do with bci since everything it does and more has already been done with utah arrays the only significant difference between them is that neuralink was designed to be a product and therefore has a more brain friendly construction and better method of implantation if utah arrays didnt cause scarring and stop working wed probably have had something like neuralink awhile ago but as of now the fda only allows them to be implanted in a brain for <number> days or less neuralinks innovation isnt in its abilities and functionality as a bci but in how it circumvents problems that have historically hampered bci like scarring biofouling tissue damage and the costdifficultyrisks in implantation,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaU1hd1FjbTZYVjZWR1FmcUJiNFZsMHFnN0M1MG1GcThuc3Rna1pjMTdoX1MyQXJ6RFl2Q183bWpwbUdmZnUxNFdzSjFFTjBscXVXQ1lSTktmMC16X2JEMzlSMVA0Qi16bjFkRFgwV185WVk9
idk why but fans of neuralink dont seem to like hearing this despite presumably being interested in bci i think theyre thinking anyone who puts neuralink in the context of bci research as a whole is just an elon hater thats obviously wrong,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbk91Q2Yxdm5kMmVPRmNnNGZLUkVFVGwta1p0R040SHJVZ2dTZDYxUmZQLUJxRnN3RzcyMmlmLVkzU2ZPcDNfMUFvOXJJeDZGSUZtRXducHBkdVJyblhuU0J3Y181ZzdhVWduOTNLR1pnQ1E9
theres three aspects of neuralink that are getting conflated here <number> neuralink in its capacity and capabilities as a brain computer interface <number> neuralink the product which encompasses everything from the custom surgical devices and procedures developed for implantation the software they use to interpret brain activity brainfriendly construction and everything else it needs to be safe and reliable enough to be approved for use and sale as a medical implant <number> neuralink as a little gadget that goes in you brain neuralinks functionality is only a subset of what has already been demonstrated using other bci technologies in animal and human tests and its not exactly game changing <number> that said in its aspect as a medical implant product it is innovative <number> as a device though it isnt a particularly complex system compared to a smartphone <number>,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTb0dOVUM1ZnlwZ2s0X1RUTWFHTnRSRWZtQWtsTEY4MHBTeGF3alI1NHFVNXc3c2hock8yVzRLTmJ2RHBGWjJLY05lR1FjYWw1M3ZtZW4tZWphQVFpckl5SThmRlZuV1gzNFNVU09lY3hSb1E9
in my mind synchron is the nokia of my analogy to the iphone that article i linked actually pointed the n as winning the available apps category over the iphone right now synchron and neuralink might both be demonstrating using their devices with a mouse on the computer but i expect that the <number> extra channels and closer proximity the neuralink device has will allow greater functionality that the synchron wont be able to match i should note that i loved my n and never have and never will own an iphone,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRE1SOTRPbm5DSW1MeEVOVUpuTkQyMENGNFR4bFNPb1FkaUdNTjV5RkpUVnkteVA5dFJiMWhoN1dWMG82Nm15R1pjX1MwNXQ3RHZiR2lmeVFaRGN4dnA4bGZWNTIwRWhQdzNRV3pGalFNMXc9
which are fundamental constraints on suitability as a bci whats the point of a bci that can only be implanted for <number> days at a time the theory points to the important thing for bci is that the bulk of the processing of the interfacing is offloaded to the brain by exploiting the neuro plasticity of the brain short time frames severely limit the degree to which the brain can adjust and integrate with the interface its very hard to even develop say teaching methods for speeding along the integration when you dont have long term data you cant ever build up on previous success each patient starts from scratch if it can be successfully embedded for long periods this is absolutely a game changer in a very fundamental sort of way,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMWg4ZjFMZFp3aHNrTUNCbVFNLXUzUzhGZ3lYa1NCbGhtbVNlektKaE5wQU9GbHRJYUQ4N0UwWDBhQ0hEd0ZsSGpBalFzOU1CQlhRR2hpQUdob1o1WkE9PQ==

> getting conflated here did you mean to respond to me fwiw im not at all disputing the innovation at neuralink im just suggesting that it is as it stands now not a quantum leap forward it has a lot of potential but its early in a long process the human implant is a huge step forward for them,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbmNwX2ZlRVVWRDhWN00ta2I4dG94SHBjQ3NCT2h6b3FRRG1OcnRtTmdDY0ZON0VBX1RsbThjbHlJV050MUJpMmtwN1N0SjBmMk1KamRPRWxqRkxZeWc9PQ==
so youre agreeing with me and the above post you ranted at then as it stands its literally just a basic modification to the electrode array intended to improve its lifespan that does not offer any improvements to its capabilities and functionality that is neuralink is a step forward towards better and longer lasting brain implants but its just a shuffle side to side where its ability to interface with the brain is concerned and itd be disingenuous to present it as more than that youd have a point if neuralink could do something that hasnt been done already for years and years ie something like incorporating an optogenetic feedback system by transfecting cells on the surface of the cerebral cortex then layering a flexible led display over them to create a nonscarring highresolution computer>brain interface,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcENkZnlWMDl4NTJ2V3hXVF9BM1Foc0lDVldKZFBPNTNJOHlOX0F0NGVpbUpvaUl6eEs0RjZKS1d3bXZ6c2VWY2xVNHExMUR1RnpYWElFblFqUkFwdWQ2XzgyVEF3MGZ5bTNVM2VGcEVkWlE9
maybe im not understanding you but are saying we should put screen on the inside of the skull and add light sensitivity to the neurons on the outside of the brain,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSnh6OXRiUUxxcEpaeXduOHpBeGdrZl9QNkZLeUx3dzdvVkUxTnk3bVRjYjFjZW12QlViRzRjR3VSZUplSjNEU2pXaFdQZjg2LXZTckt0cTJCV21acUE9PQ==
its called optogenetics and its commonly used to control and observe neural activity it basically involves modifying neurons using an adenoassociated virus these create a sort of fake nucleus containing the virus payload instead of injecting themselves into your dna all willynilly that lets researchers control the excitation and inhibition of neurons very precisely using light and even receiverecord neuron activity through light as well the tech has been around for awhile now at least <number> years while it hasnt been used in humans yet animal testing has validated its potential and there are already some projects that seek to incorporate the methods of optogenetics for creating less invasive higher bandwidthresolution neural interfaces for implants for example creating prosthetic eyes to cure blindness by modifying retinal ganglion cells that normally just transmit signals from photoreceptors to the visual cortex so that they can be activated or inhibited with an implanted led array which thanks to led displays can already be produced with extremely high resolution as though they were photoreceptors using data sent from external cameras there have even been some twoway interfaces that use genetically encoded calcium indicators there are many types and variants of geci but as as an example one technique causes neurons to produce a protein that fluoresces in nearinfrared but gets dimmer when calcium binds to it which allows sensors to measure neural activity in realtime since neural excitation requires activation of voltagegated calcium channels and rapid ion concentration changes that can be detected optogenetic methods allow you to use fiberoptic wires and arrays to record trigger and inhibit neural activity and have achieved single neuron resolutions implantable optogenetic fiber optic wire with single digit micron thickness exists already one unique advantage of this method over electrode arrays is that optogenetic interfaces offload and distribute work that would otherwise be performed by your implant onto the neurons themselves which lets you transmit and receive data through wires that are nothing more than invisibly thin dumb light tubes i think the above demonstrates that despite your earlier comment the neuralink is not actually running up against fundamental limitations of bci and as a bci isnt doing anything new at all its a straightforward implementation of the typical microelectrode array approach with a modified array that cant do anything that hasnt already been done before and fails to do some things that have been done before though again it is innovative as a productimplantable medical device if not in its actual brain interfacing ability,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcEhMV0FsVG9zT2t5YVVDU080SEg0SWk5SkE4NnVfUGk2Y0lhOXhYaVhYTThoUV9IX0VaLWkwWThZLTkxekQ1N0U3MG5jYm1NaVRsN1BHY0dYSzN6ZkczX1EzTlZqbDFjU05JRGlsQkpPUG89

i do want to point out that first human trials have already fallen behind what i thought at the time but on rereading your post i want to add something to my comment that was left unsaid because it already felt like pilingon but it was something i did consider when i gave that <number>++ yr assessment your comment implies that the implants will have stimulation of some sort built in but just stimulating neural tissue in any way is an extremely open area of research particularly when it comes to medical safety providing input to a brain let alone a human brain is not even an open area of research yet beyond massstimulation effects that are designed to excite or suppress a large neural population the only area that has some research behind it very crude and from at least three decades ago is the wellstructured visual cortex thus my remarks about blind people edit and of course the very successful application of cochlear implants but arguably thats nerve stimulation not brain having any sort of structured stimulation in any area of the brain past the point of viability which has not been even approached yet not only resets the regulatory clock but can put it a few decades behind just on its own,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRmlxVm9XX3BtaEpwSk5MT1RITno0bUlSMmQ0TDNtRS1BRWJULTd0a184Vy1xWWFDR3J0SjIxTXA4N09fSkotN1h2Vm9OTUJscnpxLVBxMzNTT2pCbHc9PQ==

youre actually incorrect sorry the system cant hack your brain the thing only interprets signals it does not send signals it interprets them the worst a hacker could actually do is hack the physical app and have access to bank accounts etc in short i have no idea where you heard this but please dont spread false info,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYXM2X0Q1eG9Xd2lZY2tHdm93cnFFalVuMmNMV0JjN1d3MlNhQjBiZEc2NlJadXYzSFJuX2x6OVZrdmJmTm1Zc2JjZ1BCMTdLa2E0LWJJZGFhUUltR1E9PQ==
the worst that can happen is they hack the app it uses neuralink is <number> way the hacker doesnt have access to your brain only the app it uses the worst they can do is tell the app to do things like send money nothing that cant already happen,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTS3NTOVhIOVNCc3NEcDg5NWphSnR0YkRUT1ByQ05yUE9aUFlfcW1uNmZkVi1aeXRrQWM4d0NuTl9UNFd5RVYtN19xSUd5Ung3bUl3Zld4eE1IaUIxNkE9PQ==

not the original model not any model it was only theory they derived we still dont have that kind of technology yet and we arent really close youre confusing that with the computer using metal and computer implants in a person essentially having an artificial back etc,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTODZGcnVETVIyM1p6bFVGVzh6Z0xyd3IzakhGZS12UEJDSnVaeGJtb3cwcE5tcXJpejNfamthUjZYMnI3Mi1rdXFaSk1TYmVFSWQtNm9wUWlLaVY1b0E9PQ==

>its not shown and the woman saw outlines barely visible they just stimulated certain parts of the brain it was seen to be very ineffective and invasive uburitomuncher finally youve recognized that we have the technology for an implant to write some data to the brain and the brain then decodes what the information means so now that youve come to that same conclusion and youve watched the video where a nural link in a pig does exactly that we are done the entire argument you were trying to make was that neural link cant do that and we dont have the technology there is nothing more to be said,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM1pTZEd0ZlBpV28zeS1LZml1VVZmVTY3TVNUb3gxMEg0MnhaR01ScTJVSllWT0pqN3Y1b2hQRDhidXgtMDR0MGxyOWJNdmRyNlFFYmFFTkhmbWJad2c9PQ==

thats what i just said maybe i worded it wrong but the pig was only showing the tracking features similar to a virtual reality head set as well as the pig had a <number> way chip they could not control the pig they monitored its brain activity something humans could do for a very long time,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMVZfSjQ5V1RtRFp1OEpOMkxwZHNxU1FJUTZBUmd0OGdYeFVKMzROSnlCVGk4Y0FIUlNBaERwWHVTSm1FTDc5SW1naElpci00RUlhT2FpUzBGS1VFS1E9PQ==
it seems you dont understand you see neurological science is actually quite complex what they were using was processing image and stimulating the optical nerve in certain ways it required dozens of computer and a lot of money and effort it was not at all feasible you would need a lot more than a brain chip to simply do that it was more just a cool thing they discovered that might be practical in <number>+ years from now and thats even a strong maybe,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWC1QVi1PWXZVVkttR3hDcHp5MUt5Tjg0UThwTkpLMTJITVl4eS1lUHhJUWtkdGcwaWpudG1wS1hrMVlkR1ZQeFVQZTFQV0M2X1AtSEhKeFVaY3Z6WGc9PQ==
>thats what i just said maybe i worded it wrong but the pig was only showing the tracking features similar to a virtual reality head set as well as the pig had a <number> way chip they could not control the pig they monitored its brain activity something humans could do for a very long time uhhh then what the heck is happening at time stamp <number><number> you know the part in the video where they say when the researcher stimulated an electrode on <number> thread of the m chip it caused the pig to bend its leg,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUjFadGV1SEJZRlVfZmZ3ZnVwSlBpNTg2bFZFdl9FU2JFSkxjRUpKS0tlaU1XZExYNGt6ZElabWdPUU93WDdyNGVBU21Mbk5ZdVN6aTA2Q0wzM19tcmc9PQ==
nerve stimulation has been around a long time its simply just not capable of much at all yet it may help with very minor things like eye sight but controlling peoples brains as you supposed which is exactly what you reference is physically almost impossible a hacker would not be able to remotely stimulate someones brain the technology just doesnt necessarily work like that its physical electricity not computer like you think,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMC1HSzhJVC03NmJYVXl0VWh1Z2FSR3l6Z2hoZHY1ZW85OTVMX1p3Z1ZoWWl1eUR3TlNROTZMeVM0V01iVEI1VVlVb2JnaXp0SjhPWWN1V1ZHTU42THc9PQ==
what they are doing in the video is called reenforcement leading where the ground truth is being derived from the retroreflective balls using motion tracking technology they are compiling that with the pigs brain signals until the computer is able to predict actual leg movement based on neuron activity once regions of the brain have been identified as responsible for a specific muscle group they then stimulate those nurons and get movement from the pig,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTejdZZ001TjZEYU1Bd28yZVZYcV9HdlpUNGQtSm9YUHBYd2VlY1ZRYkFrQnlfMWk3OHZQdGljdzZDVkREejF2MlFWYkhKYy1wZFJDRXNwRjU3blg2clE9PQ==
i did not see that part of the video however it is actually the equivalent of electrocuting someone essentially you are physically shocking the nerve ending you are not controlling it from the brain they are electrocuting the pigs leg basically again technology weve had for a while not the same tech in current neuralink,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYXd2cnpHWHI3VzFuMFh4NjhrZ254eTZma3BhYWVOUWJIRUdlcnJPN2h0enVXMElzZ1ItZ2NIWnhLWmZZWm9TVXNwUHpBUmRtbDNFbVIzX2ZocG1tQ3c9PQ==
eye sight is minor  sit down for a second and look out a window do you see how much detail and how much information your brain is processing try to describe exactly what you see to yourself in so much detail that you could recreate exactly what your seeing wow thats a lot of data your brain is handling pretty minor ey why cant a hacker remotely stimulate a persons brain brain > nural link > bluetooth > phone > internet that gives you <number> entry points to get to the neural link assume the nural link is installed in someone like the pig in the video from there the individual who has remote access could send a signal to the device interfaces with the nural link which then tells the nural link to stimulate a thread as happens in the video,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZXJ1cUl6ZkRiQ1Jqd2RjM25sT2xWckl1blI2ZGppU29KQnRKOW84MEk3RjE4STExZ0s1bGxDS1N6VDhkc2U1OVJMZjdWOFF1U3hoM3BORmFmZnZCX1E9PQ==
there is <number> separate stimulates not <number> they only see where its coming from then choose to activate the certain neuron connected to that leg to summarize they find where nerve activity is locate that nerve separately keyword electrocute the leg basically selectively electrocuting body parts,r/neuralink,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbzBKN1o2djkxUmVxWF9ETnFZbHFIVTVLU2VIS1FqenVsQWd3RWdTTU9VcE92NTNlTmdxV0JyWFlURTBjeG9XZ3VqYXZOQm5rN3hERGVNZVFBSzNUS1E9PQ==
