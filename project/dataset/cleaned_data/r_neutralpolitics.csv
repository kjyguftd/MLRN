my understanding is that he could but that whoever would be doing the killing is not immune themselves and is also not protected from following unlawful orders question is is an order from the president still considered unlawful if the president issuing the order is immune from any legal repercussions and for a more absurdist scenario can a sitting president personally commit extrajudicial killings as an official act can biden theoretically invite a bunch of people for dinner and then shoot them all in the face as long as he crosses his ts and dots his is in a classified document explaining how this was not meant as an unofficial act beforehand,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORVZWcm84enBtLThsUGFLNzVsYXEyUlhuVE9DZWhmbE8xUkpnc0JSdUlXN0Z0S1JhQ0tPd3B2V3AtNUVKdWp3Z0hTWFlra2hwU1NjTVEyUVlLX05Odnc9PQ==
my analysis of the project <number> letter as a lifelong democrat and atheist i approached kevin d roberts a promise to america with a critical eye here is my synthesized reading of the foreword letter by the author focusing on his key issues and strategic views on government key issues highlighted by the author <number> family stability and protection issue the crisis of fatherlessness and family breakdown quote the next conservative president must get to work pursuing the true priority of politicsthe wellbeing of the american family <number> reducing government size and bureaucratic overreach issue the expansive and unaccountable administrative state quote the administrative state holds <number> percent of its power at the sufferance of congress and its insulation from presidential discipline is an unconstitutional fairy tale spun by the washington establishment to protect its turf <number> national sovereignty and border security issue open borders and illegal immigration quote the united states belongs to we the people all government authority derives from the consent of the people and our nations success derives from the character of its people <number> economic revival and energy independence issue economic stagnation and dependency on foreign energy quote americas vast reserves of oil and natural gas are not an environmental problem they are the lifeblood of economic growth <number> protecting individual liberties and constitutional rights issue erosion of individual rights and freedoms quote the next conservative president must defend our first amendment rights <number> combatting cultural and ideological threats issue the influence of woke culture and progressive ideologies in institutions quote the noxious tenets of critical race theory and gender ideology should be excised from curricula in every public school in the country geopolitics and taxes geopolitics roberts is highly critical of china viewing it as a totalitarian enemy engaged in a strategic and economic cold war against america he condemns american corporations for their economic engagement with china which he believes undermines us national security and economic independence he advocates for energy independence and a robust national defense to counter global threats taxes roberts calls for tax reforms that support family stability by eliminating marriage penalties and promoting economic freedom through progrowth policies he stresses the importance of protecting the taxexempt status of churches and charities against progressive ideologies x matrices on government views option <number> urgency vs impact of government actions | | immediate | longterm | |||| | high impact | immediate high impact addressing family stability border security and reducing government size | longterm high impact economic revival energy independence and protecting individual liberties | | low impact | immediate low impact quick fixes to bureaucratic inefficiencies | longterm low impact incremental changes in education or minor regulatory adjustments | option <number> area of focus vs degree of government intervention | | high intervention | low intervention | |||| | economic focus | high intervention economic strategic economic policies heavy regulation for energy independence and domestic manufacturing revival | low intervention economic promoting freemarket principles reducing economic regulations | | social focus | high intervention social active policies to protect family stability secure borders and remove woke ideologies from education | low intervention social emphasizing individual liberties and minimal government role in social issues | my take on the separation of church and state while roberts emphasizes protecting the taxexempt status of churches and promoting family values often associated with religious beliefs i did not get the impression that he aims to erode the separation between church and state his focus seems more on safeguarding religious institutions rights rather than pushing for a theocratic government the emphasis is on protecting individual liberties and preventing government overreach which aligns with a broad interpretation of upholding constitutional principles without explicitly merging church and state additional thoughts from what i read so far its not some big evil master plan that redditors are making it out to be the left should write their version of a <number> plan,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORUJPemd0RXpNRlhDT1laUXRKSlhlNmlDREI3WkNsWUp1R0xYLU9HMHZIaWN1YUpzQUgwZmp2WDQxWldITWN5SHFqem9qaGdiRFpQTTI3cUdhanRSUkE9PQ==

a meme just got posted to another subreddit that attributes various extreme positions to mandate for leadership in particular the section on the department of justice is claimed to end civil rights and dei protections in government end marriage equality and eliminate unions and worker protections i was interested to know if these statements are actually made in the section so spent an amount of time reading through it here is my analysis the section on the department of justice opens with a list of complaints about the feds unfairly targeting conservatives half of which involve the fbi pp<number> they then lay out their plan to resolve this alleged political imbalance the first concrete step besides the general calls for institutional review and internal structural reorganization that appears throughout project <number> is > prohibit the fbi from engaging in general in activities related to combating the spread of socalled misinformation and disinformation by americans who are not tied to any plausible criminal activity the united states government and by extension the fbi have absolutely no business policing speech whether in the public square in print or online the first amendment prohibits it project <number> is correct that a fundamental principle of governmentfunded speech has been to avoid any appearance of involvement in political discourse we can see this in how voa was prohibited from operating within the borders of the us from <number> to <number><url> however if were talking about the fbi its actual history has been replete with propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion from the very beginning if project <number> wishes to resolve this possible contradiction they have a lot of work ahead and i wish them luck if this is a hypocritical plan to manipulate public opinion in the other direction i do not wish them luck another project <number> initiative strikes me as strange > rigorously prosecute as much interstate drug activity as possible including simple possession of distributable quantities by this they mean restarting enforcement of federal scheduling laws which have been allowed to lapse in many circumstances this would be extremely unpopular including with conservatives for instance <number> of americans believe marijuana should be legal in some circumstances<url> i doubt this part of project <number> will be enacted and it is telling that this is one of their main suggestions for combating ms<number> several pages deal with the vital national question of baking cakes or creating websites for gay marriages but there is no direct attack on samesex marriage much more space is devoted to abortion rights > announce a campaign to enforce the criminal prohibitions in <number> us code <number> and <number> against providers and distributors of abortion pills that use the mail federal law prohibits mailing every article instrument substance drug medicine or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for producing abortion following the supreme courts decision in dobbs there is now no federal prohibition on the enforcement of this statute the department of justice in the next conservative administration should therefore announce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills this section of the us code has its roots in the infamous comstock act of <number><url> it is indeed within the mandate of the doj to enforce such laws and was famously done so by anthony comstock <number><number> to halt the distribution of womens suffrage newspapers including contraceptive advertisements another section complains that the face act a law signed by clinton in <number> protecting the entrances to abortion clinics should not be enforced > by engaging in disparate and viewpointbased enforcement of an already controversial law like the face act against prolife activists the doj has needlessly undermined its credibility with lawabiding people of faith the doj indeed has the right to stop enforcing this law i did not find that end civil rights and dei protections in government end marriage equality and eliminate unions and worker protections were major parts of this section this section focuses on redmeat religious conservative issues such as the drug war abortion clinics abortion pills christian bakeries and immigration it mainly limits itself to choices the doj could make in order to appeal to religious conservatives while these choices may seem abhorrent and indeed might be unpopular with most americans they are largely not a novel use of doj powers but simply suggest a return to bygone types of enforcement belated edit another part of the meme which is now being widely circulated and repeated is that this section defunds the fbi in fact it states that funds should be redistributed from the fbi head office to local branch offices presumably with the goal of slowing politicaladministrative state activities in dc and speeding up law enforcement in local areas it does not call to decrease fbi funding as a whole,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPcXJnOHVHOWdtSDM5S1lta3NObWhKNXdYdk5ieGxXc2VaLVN5Ykl5Vl9pLWZWc3VwcDlVNm1KbHRkbmhQb1E0allROW85WmlSdjhfdExZM3N5SzUxUGc9PQ==
ive worked in the intelligence community and knew better than to think that anything unclassified would be useful lol regardless youve outlined some broad strokes and seemed to have some interesting questions and contentions > they call out the cia as being essentially autonomous from the odni yeah the dni was originally created as a response to <number><number> in order to streamline interagency communications originally the director of the cia was the head of the intelligence community<url> rumsfeld had a beef with the cia<url> and decided to neuter it to whatever extent he could hence the creation of the dni it would thus make sense there is likely some animosity between the cia and the dni >implement the presidents intelligence priorities i think that something as critical as the nations intelligence community should be a more bureaucratic and meritdriven enterprise it should be tasked with informing the president and other leaders but this quote makes me think that the author is arguing that it should be more at the whim of the president just about all parts of the intelligence community report to cabinet level positions<url> primarily the dod but also state doe treasury etc the cabinet serves at the pleasure of the potus and thus all people reporting to cabinet level officials also serve at the pleasure of the potus the potus wields this enormous power because in this day and age we possess a permanent standing army by far the most powerful standing army in the world as lincoln put it when he exercised the suspension clause<url> now it is insisted that congress and not the executive is vested with this power but the constitution itself is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power and as the provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency it cannot be believed the framers of the instrument intended that in every case the danger should run its course until congress could be called together the very assembling of which might be prevented the idea here is that the very nature of the executive is to make fiat decisions when the situation demands it ie during an emergency in which the deliberative nature of congress becomes impractical that we have a standing army now something the founding fathers explicitly stated would lead to a tyranny by the executive<url> means that such dangers that would require a powerful executive exist every second of every minute of every day this would require subsuming the national security apparatus of which the intelligence community is but a small part to the whims of the potus this makes selecting a good potus one that is well versed in the awesome responsibilities she is called to hold an incredibly important task one that in this day and age may or may not lead to armageddon >preventing the abuse of intelligence for partisan purposes im of the opinion that this is simply not possible that given the arguments ive laid out above the potus is tasked with doing whatever she deems prudent with the intelligence community quoting federalist <number> once the necessity of a standing army became a permanent fixture any semblance of the freedoms and liberties this country was ostensibly founded upon slowly but surely disappear<url> >>> the veteran legions of rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world not the less true is it that the liberties of rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs and that the liberties of europe as far as they ever existed have with few exceptions been the price of her military establishments a standing force therefore is a dangerous at the same time that it may be a necessary provision on the smallest scale it has its inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution the best solution to this particular problem would be to gut the standing army if at all possible im of the opinion that such a move is not prudent and thus in all likelihood our freedoms and liberties will continue to erode this is best seen leading up to jan th that the military was relevant at all<url> is a sign that if the military wanted to it could have picked a sideand who or what could stand up to the us military if it came to a fight all it takes for the us to descend into authoritarianism and some version of martial law at this point is an executive with <number> the will to power and <number> the ability to bend the us military to hisher will someone like trump certainly has the former but clearly does not have the latterat least not yet because the military serves at the pleasure of the potus top officials like mark milley when designing a counter to what he called a reichstag moment believed the only choice the military had at that point to object was mass resignations<url> you can then game this outan executive with this will to power could then just continue to fireforce resignations from top military officials until he got to one loyal to him after all this was one of the first steps trump did after the <number> elections<url> in what is seen now as an attempt at a coup by trump<url> >he also suggests to fire or refer for prosecution employees who are even suspecting of leaking information while i agree that leaks in the intelligence community are a serious matter that seems a bit of an extreme measure as opposed to say putting restrictions on the employee while conducting an investigation people have been executed for violating the espionage act<url> which is more or less akin to treason a simple firing is tame by comparison just think about how vulnerable the us would be if our nuclear submarine capability a closely held secret were exposed<url> we would lose our second strike capability rendering our nuclear deterrent useless an adversary like russia could threaten nuclear annihilation and we would be powerless to protect ourselves from it other than to launch a surprise initial nuclear strike which if russia still possessed its second strike capability would lead to armageddon and mutually assured destruction we would lose the strategic level of warfare ie nukes and in all likelihood would lose our mantle as a superpower such is the power of secrets all of this is within the commander in chiefs purview to shape design and execute with congress left only with the power of the purse to say otherwiseand this assuming a militarized executive would even bother to care about what congress had to say edit just to be clear here whenever i talk about a standing army the intelligence community is assumed to be a small part of it thus all arguments related to a standing army also apply to the intelligence community much of the intelligence community carries out functions once explicit to the military for example reconnaissance most modern reconnaissance is now performed by the nsa the nro provides the hardware<url>,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPVXVqcE5XZjJuRnI2RjRhMDdDaHZMdGpVQnQ2b0hjNXMzWm9iYmxjblhiclVwV3lDdTRXLXhOeUhubjVtWHpSNzNkTXhTc3JJdXBuWVpHMG9MN3Z6VFE9PQ==
> he also suggests to fire or refer for prosecution employees who are even suspecting of leaking information i just wanted to address this one statement in some detail im of the opinion that most people have no idea how strict the rules are when it comes to handling intelligence first some backgroundgonna talk about scifs<url> which typically require a tssci clearance to access<url> scifs are extremely sensitive facilities with strict rules as to what you can bring into it without losing your security clearance keep in mind that losing your clearance is synonymous with losing your job and getting fired in the field of intelligence in the article about scifs they discuss the prohibition on bringing a smart phone into the facility >>>inadvertently bringing a cellphone into a scif is by far the most common violation its a violation because weve long known that foreign intelligence services can remotely turn a targets cell phone into a covert listening device even when the phone is not in use this is more than enough to compromise the facility anyone bringing in a smart phone into a scif is already as you put it suspected of leaking informationthe only thing that is not demonstrated is the intent to do so and when it comes to this level of security intent matters a lot less than determining whether or not you are practicing appropriate operational security opsec which is part of any intelligence agents job description if you are lax in opsec it will be a matter of time before you lose your clearance and are thus fired from your job the intent or lack thereof to leak information becomes wholly irrelevant keep in mind that even a janitor mopping floors in a scif needs the proper level of security clearance to enter the facility a lot of people believe that because it deals with intelligence this particular field shares a lot in common with academia because its also full of smart people people do not understand that unlike academia which is all about revealing information in order to advance understanding intelligence works on a very different set of assumptions and that deceit and obfuscation are the main tools of the trade terms like plausible deniability<url> and compartmentalization<url> are routine in intelligence whereas in academia anyone practicing such tools would be laughed out of the building the methodology is very different and requires a very different way of thinking about the value of information if you want to see an example as to how intelligence and academia can clash sometimes severely you can watch the movie oppenheimer<url>almost the entire movie is a security clearance interview and due to the sensitive nature of the evidence a public trial is simply not an option ie the movie public is more or less kept in the dark about what is going on in the movie even oppenheimer and the counsel he held on retainer are kept in the dark about information pertinent to himself and his clearance the movie depicts a conflict between the military and the academic community they sought out to build the atom bomb and how that conflict centered around compartmentalization,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPWFk3ZmVjSjZsRDJkaU1DNWE5d1JkMHhuZ0p3LWxnNG1YUkJjalplbHJBamNCTmFRTElhNXFHbGtxV25HM21VdF9oSVZ2YXhCNzdDbnE2OS1vWFlDN2c9PQ==

no worries lets go through it what youre getting at in the submission is understandable but per rule a it needs to ask a specific political question right now theres no question so please add at least one heres an example though you are by no means required to use it > whats the general election success rate in the us when a party replaces the incumbent next per rule d please make sure all factual claims and premises are supported by sources such as these > incumbents enjoy a number of advantages from the party and the public > the pinch hitter penalty in baseball and finally a note about this part > the sample size will probably need to include congressional and gubernatorial races i recommend replacing congressional with senate or senatorial house elections are by district where the partisan lean is often so strong that whoever wins the primary from the dominant party is practically guaranteed to win the general so including those results would skew the answers to the question youre asking if you can make those adjustments well be good thanks for engaging in the process,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPSUlnN1FCQkxZMW5ZOW1DSmJRZGwwREtVN3Z0eEp4Ul80YkJSYUQ1bVhOMkw1Y21iV1hfNUxnbFVVWEJTZ1N6RmxHWmNKU3dfdEtydk5md3hEdTU5dFE9PQ==

ok great lets go through it per rules a b we require a specific political question and the post must be framed in a neutral way can someone please explain doesnt quite qualify but something like this would > what are the pros and cons of the current impeachment process in the united states then per rules c d the post itself would need some background and a source explaining the impeachment process and how it works when reading that source youll find that impeachment and conviction are two separate things so the text of the submission could be something like this > the impeachment process in the united states involves the house of representatives impeaching a federal office holder and then the senate deciding whether or not to convict them if convicted the senate also decides whether to remove them from office and separately whether they should be barred from seeking office in the future link to a source that explains this whole process > donald trump was impeached twice but not convicted by the senate either time and is now running for president again link to source > what are the pros and cons of an impeachment process that can present significant facts against a person but where the bar to conviction is high enough that they can retainregain their office is this system working the way the framers of the constitution intended it to under the current system of impeachment are there sufficient checks on individual power to prevent bad actors from taking office something like that would work if you have any comments or questions just reply here and thanks in advance for engaging in the process,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZkF1VDNKU0doTnRpU2h1VFJvTmZ4WVZjalFQMzM0ZlBxeXFZUGtIcnJ4VkZ3TlZOUmp6SXREaXZTQUlTQTN1V1M0Tm9JYTZSQXlWa1gyR3ZKejVhZ1E9PQ==

i look at this issue quite differently for many nations if you want to have good schools infrastructure healthcare and education you need more military spending not less the prime example right now is ukraine whose citizens infrastructure healthcare prosperity and future have all suffered dramatically since <number><url> they have an aggressive neighbor who in <number> threatened ukraine and georgia and with the latter used propaganda techniques to foment dissent and construct a pretext for invasion<url> at the time ukraines military budget was <number> of gdp they should have recognized the threat and increased their military spending but <number> was the height of the financial crisis and it was difficult for governments everywhere to allocate any funds toward anything that didnt have an immediate impact on the welfare of their people so in the years following their military spending actually decreased but by <number> ukraine still hadnt raised their military spending thats the year the country made overtures to the west and in response putin directly threatened to invade two of their provinces still they didnt emphasize military preparedness they overthrew their leader for favoring russia in <number> but apparently thought there would be no military consequences later that year putin invaded crimea and started a civil war in two provinces of eastern ukraine<url> the ukrainians werent properly prepared to fight them off and their people suffered greatly yet still military spending only increased to <number> of gdp by <number> that increase allowed them to hold the russians in place modernize some of their equipment and train new forces but not expel the invaders apparently content with that by <number> ukrainian military spending was at <number> of gdp the russians launched their full scale invasion early in the following year which is what finally caused the ukrainians to go onto a real war footing but in the meantime russia with a much larger population has shifted to a complete wartime economy<url> and look where all this has gotten the ukrainian people all the citizenfocused policy areas highlighted in this post poverty education and healthcare plus many more are markedly worse for ukrainians today theres no guarantee that things would have gone better had they invested more in their military but deterrence is definitely more costeffective than war additionally one of the primary drivers of ukraines economy these days is their arms industry<url> which is putting a lot of food on the table in a lot of households there and will likely be a major sector of their export economy if they survive the war in short the world is a dangerous place countries that dont protect themselves are at risk from bad actors who can take advantage of their vulnerability and dramatically worsen life for their people maintaining a strong military and credible deterrent is an essential component of protecting the citizens from that potential outcome,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQUlgtTk9sQTJNd2duRndFbHpzREI2RGRWbzI0cm1DUkJPM3Y2czJpX21xLUtzWWFGSDA1SnhBa0xzeUg1S0tudVNfeGV1d1A1ZjhmXzJwTU1KV0llaGc9PQ==

imho the best way to look at this issue is structurally and to focus on two words security competition unlike in the corporate setting where competition is encouraged and monopoly discouraged in the realm of security competition equates to people and nations killing each other in order to feel secure the main driver of this state of affairs is whats called the security dilemma<url> ie as nations spend more to defend themselves they actually become less safe as detailed below in the corporate setting a dominant market share makes a company feel safe from bankruptcy and similarly in the security setting a dominant position of power will render a nation safe from annihilation in the corporate setting competition is encouraged because the customer ie all the people actually benefit from lower prices and better products when corporations compete in the security setting however all competition does is destroy cities and forces nations to commit mass murder and so it is highly discouraged this issue sadly is structural ie its less about whether or not you can just devise some strategy to mitigate security competitionrather you need to see how much competition is out there the more competitors leading to more militarization during the unipolar moment<url> military spending was low throughout the world particularly in the united states<url> note military spending actually decreased from <number> to <number> this of course makes senseas no one could challenge the us no one including the us needed to spend as much on security as the newsweek article points out the unipolar moment has ended and security competition between multiple great powers is the norm going forward this equates to increased military expenditure by all great powers as they all fear annihilation by a prepared adversary as they increase spending on the military this alarms their competitors which in turn also increase military spending ie an arms race develops until a clearly dominant party emerges all parties become less safe as a result this is clearest in regions where security competition is acute ie places like the korean peninsula and israel both south korea and israel have a mandatory conscription policy<url> such is their need for military spending so the tldr answer to your op question is that the demilitarization you are looking for now actually occurred <number> years ago during the unipolar moment we are now in the opposite environment and so an arms race is in all likelihood inevitable,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRT092bTJCSHUycHB1MzdoWXZUSWNJNjI3YTBBdU5FVFhlZ3cycWtEejBOcGl6RjFibUdLbWtEVjhac0J4ZEIxY1F0ODhTWG1oRkpjMndFX0hsNW5sY3c9PQ==

this is a great post so i appreciate it from my experience pacs seem to be created exclusively for obscuring individuals and their influence money id be curious to one day read over the legal aspects of pacs too ive been personally building some resource lists but hadnt jumped into pac money flow my focus was on general reliable news sources the problems and their reasons with american politics are many and complex but pacs are a sizeable segment of it i had a few notes on pacs but they were more concerned with investigative reporting generally and not on money sources i hope these spark an idea in you that builds on your current knowledge heres a few things ive learned my background is in investigations intelligence collection military and politics even if you cant see the whole trail every connection you uncover can help you connect the dots board members what other organizations these people workcontribute to pay attention to the messaging these pacs push who benefits from the policies theyre advocating for who tends to lend support dont just rely on the big news outlets look for investigative journalism smaller watchdog groups and even social media with a healthy dose of skepticism of course when it comes to these outlets i can often find valid data and cited references in the more slanted websitesorganizations but it gets quarantined until i corroborate it i know this isnt the most helpful comment as far as resources go but i hope its encouraging,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYb2xxLVVJMm9JdG5xeUZzdFVKc0tJaGliRjVwRWlKeW4zQVRrb2hxZzRuZHljTTRxeFRmR2IwZUFUcnkzOVV1SzRwU1NpOVFNMEJHZ0tJMDYxTHdqTVE9PQ==

thats a great point the supreme courts interpretation of the separation of powers indeed makes it challenging to limit presidential immunity through legislation alone the core issue lies in distinguishing between the president as an individual and the president as an entire branch of government because this has been deemed a constitutional matter changing it would require either the supreme court to overturn its decision or a constitutional amendment to be passed making legislative remedies difficult to implement directly,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYU9BbUxTX256TTNEYkp2STFpLWdjaU1WcTlOYXh1ZzlpaFpNTHlvalYzZGtRVGFjZndrMlRLYWVvU1BRTWw1QUdvYklBMDBiN1ZIWC0xa3d0T0Q4Rnc9PQ==

hi there uroundone im a mod in rneutralpolitics this submission is in the queue awaiting moderator approval normally we allow request for sources type of posts but this particular topic is so volatile and subject to manipulation right now as you note that it would be nearly impossible to moderate our recommendation is to monitor trusted sources like this associated press article<url> and official releases from investigative bodies like the fbi and secret service for the time being ignore any talk about ties to particular groups as that kind of thing has a higher likelihood of being disinformation<url> thanks for understanding edit additionally such a post may violate reddits antidoxxing policy<url> its unclear if a shooter would be exempt from that policy as a public figure but the spirit of the policy is to prevent harassment<url> while the shooter is deceased and thus not susceptible to harassment if the social media is identifying eg not an anonymous reddit account it could lead to harassment of family members,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSVlpdUhDa2lyRXliU2YwckdiSUJTMmxTU0dHMkxCQS1OMXpVV21SdHBHa2tGdDVuQU95bnNORVFZUGxRT3lMd3ZSR1J0Z3NJS3VGYTZhS0lTN0lEQkE9PQ==

thanks for reading the rules and engaging in the process youre not being disrespectful at all theres always a bit of interpretation involved so lets go through the post and ill explain what adjustments need to be made > would you like me to link a citable thirdparty article yes thats part of it per rule d submissions that do not include sources will be rejected even just an article or study describing the test would be fine you dont need to support its accuracy please also provide a source to support the implied premise that such tests are not currently required its difficult to prove a negative but with a quick search i was able to find that the us office of personnel management includes one type of cognitive test in its hiring evaluations<url> its not clear when or for what positions it applies along those lines please tell the users what jurisdiction youre talking about many users will assume its for the us federal government but this is an international forum and it may be that some other jurisdictions already employ such practices either on the state level or in other countries finally per rule bs requirement for neutral framing we dont allow questions that only ask for responses from one side of an issue so an alternative way to frame the title question would be something like > what are the pros and cons of requiring cognitive tests for government positions and in the text > would you prefer a more openended question such as what would be the benefits and drawbacks of providingrequiring a test such as the moca before an individual is elected or given security clearance yes exactly so sources neutrality and a little more detail are whats needed overall its an interesting question and i expect it will generate some good discussion just reply here if you have any questions,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOEI2SjdjQlZIdXp2NzI4TU5kUkdiLVFiUHpxM25JWGZWZnVUMGU5ZVJTT0kwcTVCQ3dERXBGWm1iQ0N3TXRvS1I2YTV5dFcwWE1OdEE1U2t5Y05RNVE9PQ==

what does the dhs report p <number> say about violence this year<url> >some dves domestic violent extremists particularly those motivated by conspiracy theories and antigovernment or partisan grievances may seek to disrupt electoral processes violence or threats could be directed at government officials voters and electionsrelated personnel and infrastructure including polling places ballot drop box locations voter registration sites campaign events political party offices and vote counting sites evaluate those statements from the perspective of one of the <number> million voters sure the large number of polling places ballot drop box locations and voter registration sites mean that one somewhere in the country will most likely experience disruption due to violence this year but it probably isnt going to be the one you use dhs isnt expressing concern about widespread coordinated activity targeting polling stations across the country dhs prediction is just that it could happen somewhere >as nprs domenico montanaro has put it just <number> votes in georgia arizona and wisconsin separated biden and trump from a tie in the electoral college<url> according to the numbers on politicos election tracker arizona was the narrowest with <number> votes for biden and <number> for trump in <number> the average voting precinct had about <number> voters<url> if you assume arizona has voting districts with <number> voters each then you would have needed to completely shut down more than <number> which would mostly have voted for biden to have made a difference in the election you would have had to have disrupted even more in georgia and wisconsin to flip the end result dhs is not predicting such widespread coordinated violence even if it were the link above noted that arizona had <number> electoral precincts in <number> so even a widespread coordinated attack on arizona polling stations sufficient to affect the results would be a fraction of a percent of polling stations the vast majority of voters would not be affected the risk from the individual voters perspective is minimal even if dhs has made a credible prediction,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabjlyc2hDV1ZEN3hTQXl2dm93SG42ci1vdTJEaUl2b1FsMEhkRllWZUR5N1RuOGt1bFBzOE9NYWgzZVFZTUVGMHBOTDhZVHhrUzNreDVVU1lpVkVuelE9PQ==

you can integrate it as long as you have evidentiary support and can keep it neutral the previous version had the tone of how do i talk to those other people who want to take away all the rights i care about that approach not only lacks neutrality but it equates the statements or actions of a few people with the desires of everyone of a particular political persuasion part of the polarization issue youre highlighting is that we allow our own side or our own media silo to define what the opposition stands for it behooves propagandists in those polarized channels to portray the oppostion in the worst possible light and with a very broad brush for example people who are steeped deeply in rightwing media silos may believe liberals as a whole want to abort fetuses up to the day theyre due while people who inhabit the extreme leftwing media environment may believe conservatives as a whole want to ban birth control that makes it hard for those people to have conversations but these are actually really extremist positions on both sides and youll find very few people identifying themselves as liberal or conservative who hold these views the point is if youre going to say everyone on a particular side of the political spectrum is a bigot youd better have really solid evidence to support it,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeVctRXB0eE9Gc2V3UjJmV0FleVZFRm94Nzd3NER1bmVXcUYyNFk1cWxNZGV4aU52dTZoY2R0U3I5NmRLTHZNc2lQcFUyWVJfZ2pRcTJpdU1VSnVqTUE9PQ==

my point is not to say that everyone on a particular side is bigoted but it is hard to prove that as true when bigoted policies are being pushed by the officials of said party without much pushback from the more moderate community it makes alot of people who are a part of marginalized communities fearful of interacting with members of the opposing party because while they may not hold those views there is not enough moderation to correct those extremists and the balance in that dynamic is unequal as in cases such as roe v wade only one side of the discussion would have to face any real consequences while the other will be physically uneffected in either scenario the polarization of politics disproportionately hurts marginalized communities because they are the ones directly affected by policy changes like the ones mentioned,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcTlhUjcwd0dRVDVUekxaLW01QnRSRU1RczVqT2w5azJuX2M3aDVIcF9pMkcxa2dOQ2VOSmdCT3dvNG1YbGRmdDJ1c1F6Sl9QZ2kyUU9YYi1VMjlsd1E9PQ==

well the rules dont prohibit you from adding the bigotry element but it must be introduced in a way thats neutral and supported by a qualified source if you can do that put it in > in cases such as roe v wade only one side of the discussion would have to face any real consequences while the other will be physically uneffected in either scenario just to play devils advocate the other side youre talking about here would argue theyre protecting the most marginalized community unborn children who dont have a voice and cannot stand up for themselves the real consequences they face are certain death im not saying this is my view or should be yours but if we want to look at the issue from a neutral perspective we should at least consider the opposing point of view of all the issues to potentially use as an example i would steer well clear of abortion it is specifically promoted as a wedge issue<url> because it is morally ambiguous,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSlBsT2czdDM0cDJid1A3dTJGbmRFVWxENVhNTkZCNFA1MDVkdnhCZkNRS0tSYU44WkpVVHpmYk1WckFES1hlMGU4cFRuYTNqOHA2VnF2NXBGaENsM0E9PQ==
selective service and the draft are related but separate selective service essentially creates a list of individuals that might be eligible for service should a draft be instated however instituting a draft would require an act of congress right now men between the ages of <number> and <number> are legally required to register for selective service so this change would just make something that is already required automatic this essentially removes the possibility of penalties<url> although im not aware of this ever actually being enforced the draft is very unpopular with the public <url> and also pretty unpopular with think tank types <url> another article with a decent summary of the bills <url> <url>,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUm5zU212TWhHV0NrZ1VYblYzWi05Zm43OWNSWFVmUldpX0RCQV9tTHhOX21Yem95aVFLdlg2N2hPWFFWWGJmQlBQTVFPd0VPLTlaVGphMUhFTmZqSEE9PQ==
alright fine i chose abortion due to its recency but if we have to change topics than the bans to gender affirming care for lgbtq youth would be my example<url> we have concrete scientific evidence that gender affirming care lowers the rate of suicide in trans and gendernoncomforming people and yet people oppose that care for one reason or another even if that argument is made from religious beliefs or nonexplicit discrimination there is truly only positives that can come from lgbtq people being less likely to commit suicide and from the perspective of lgbtq people specifically trans and gendernonconforming people that feels especially targeted and hurtful that people would be silent in light of these bans,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRlVvRDZxdXhxNFRFOFNnM1FSV3ROQTJRYnp6U21PTFR3TGRaWE1hWTJzRTVTdkxSdHRwZGR4bFBOMDY1UzlmTkNUN214bWxDd2F6WDRrbEdMbWxvWHc9PQ==
i mean i could certainly argue the other side of that sorry the state has a longestablished interest in protecting minors we dont allow them to serve in the military drink alcohol or sign contracts conservatives would argue that preventing them from permanently altering their bodies is entirely in line with that tradition and is thereby protecting them i personally think thats a decision that should be left to the individual their family and medical professionals but i dont claim the opposing view is entirely without merit when were truly informed about opposing views its difficult to stake out an unyielding position and also be neutral,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdjc4VjdVRFVGNU05LWNDanNoY3BOck1HMktQYU85SnJoczhUUWdHMmJOVy1xaDJsX2J3TnVtZHl6VTZ0UTMtWk1BTVlNRS11NEJBRkhiblRJSzBJamc9PQ==
but even by that logic gender affirming care is clearly outlined that medical alterations are only given by medical professionals<url> on its basic level gender affirming care is social and emotional for minors such as using preferred pronouns and chosen names if we truly believe in protecting minors and we are looking at this from a researched and neutral perspective than we have to acknowledge the information we have again im not saying everyone against this is bigoted but voting against this without a full comprehention of the information we have is dangerous to real peoples lives and can cause immense distrust from the people affected,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc0xQVnBqM21oUTF0YVRfaldtNWlrUWs0djFKVXlVcEZBNlg3VmVsU05TOFpoNEpMS214SlVyMXJUbFZWMnRaTExoYVFyTjNLNHFaOVpwanJ3aG5TRGc9PQ==
you make strong points on the issue itself all im saying is that we wont consider the submission neutral if the point is to ask how can we reduce tribalism when the other side holds entirely meritless and bigoted positions while my side is unequivocally good just and right yes i understand youre not stating it in this exaggerated way but itll come across as hypocritical demonstrating the same kind of intolerance youre accusing the other side of practicing if you stake out a position that presumes the opposition is acting from a position of bigotry rather than moral conviction it will also completely distract from the question youre really trying to ask about how to reduce political hostility having been doing this for a dozen years now i guarantee our users would report such a post for rule b violations complain that we ever let it through and force us to take it down and if the reworked submission ive posted above actually gets at the core question for you i dont really see a reason to add the bigotry aspect as weve discussed though you could potentially get into that in the comments alternatively you could post it in a subreddit without the neutrality requirement we wouldnt be offended,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYXJWU2NTalNhOUt1eENRWXNWZzk2bWloTXRCb0lhb3h6Y3NCYjFseXZtUzhsdEFZRkJ2TUNUSDZyOUdoUUVXY3ByTlNPNGZZVS1sVXdFcDhOODN0Tmc9PQ==
i understand but im not claiming that my side is completely in the right either but policies and laws like the one i mentioned earlier are divisive and align with conservative viewpoints than progressive ones i would be more than happy to discuss bigotry displayed by leftists progressives and the democratic party but the main issue i want to tackle here is how identity in of itself can drastically affect how people view politics and make it difficult to have productive conversation or view people with opposing viewpoints in a less than hostile manor its much easier to morally justify a law about something that does not directly affect a group you belong to because you yourself will not have to face any consequences but in that same vain being a part of the affected group can lead to irrational support or contempt that disuades conversation we can use the reworked prompt i want to be neutral but its difficult to see time and time again where people who dont truly understand the life i and many people like me live but still decide that they know more about us than we do and that they know how to manage our lives better when they dont even take the time to truly know whats going on,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSm9YUER2RlR5c1FvUGtVRWlRdDFqcXRkX202R2NSVDBDcG1QZnE1UkVlMVdTVlk3RHQzYU1mMGVQdEpnOHB0NHlDS0FBNzJGWkpwRkNUWi0zanZmQkE9PQ==

basically a true democracy creates true diffusion of power where the people together are in power no single person holds any more power than another no allpowerful president or congress peopleparliamentarians etc even though leadership positions may exist they are always at all times subject to the control of the people now in such a system already competition for power is pretty much made useless you dont have elections where you have whole sale packages choosing between two packages party <number> and <number> wholesale you vote for its good and bad because again the goal is competition for power no this time no one comes with a long manifesto and comes as a whole package issues are decided on an individual bases so its now about competition of issues when any issue is tabled before the parliamentary body it can come from anyone any number of people we compare and contrast the solutions proposed on each issue and try to get the best one to rise to the top when that issue is done next one is on its own thats the gist of it i will conclude by defining politics funny i put this at the conclusion this is defined by an independent author fuseini yakubu in his new book the tragedy called democracy in the st century <number> see <url> hence the reason i said you wont find in common literature i use these definitions because much of existing literature on these issues are flawed inconsistent now according to him politics is the way in which relationships with and between members of a community are formed managed or exploited to achieve set goals within or of that community now when the goal of the activities described above is to win power for someone thats power politics when the goal or object of the activities above is to push for an issue that results in issue politics im simplifying it and there may seem like there is an overlap but i guarantee you there isnt its always <number> or the other and i dont mean there are only <number> forms of politics one is always the primary goal and another may feature as a secondary means to the primary and the secondary may thus be manipulated and no identity politics is not among its not a form of politics thats an error in existing literature its classified as something else i really cant do justice to these discussions in a comments section but thats the gist of it,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnenZ6VDJaajhxOFdlU19QYlFzMFpUV0Z6UFVLMXlCUUJMTlpDLWF1YU5UTzZHY19BTFZuRGNDakt0OTZ2ZmlHSFJRb3JoQUxLVTVfT1F3ak1HNERfRFE9PQ==

this would just result in oligarchy if anyone can raise an issue only the richest will be able to promote said issue to gain enough popular awareness and support to get it passed only the richest will be able to afford psychological profiling media targeting mass advertising etc etc both to craft their desired policy in just the right language that is both broadly appealing and accomplishing their goal and then to message that policy to the amenable masses and it would still devolve into political parties theyll just be paid by rich people instead of by tax dollars groups of the rich will find common ground on enough issues to hire permanent groups of consultants to do their message crafting targeting and messaging advertising the consultants will be a combo of lawyers marketers data tech people and psych analysts much like a campaign team different groups of rich people will coalesce around different platforms none of this will be some conspiracy its just efficiency why would a rich person pay to spin up all that data and expertise for just one policy the result would be a dystopian nightmare largely because instead of rich people having to fight for the attention and obedience of the power brokers they just hire them directly,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUDFaQ3FoVjJxLThZU3NnZjBZelBSd1pYNENSa0J0ZG5VdlZhU3ZOWDdaTkxHdkhZRlJFcGF4V1BfbWF0Y3N2UW1FOC1KQnhLMnVjbmFSaS15RGYyZlE9PQ==

thanks for adding that but unfortunately a link to a book without pointspecific excerpts does not suffice the comment in question makes extremely definitive statements about what can only happen in the current system and what the only way to fix it is its an unequivocal diagnosis and prescription which already throws up a lot of red flags for this forum but without sources it simply cannot stand sorry that being said its not overly long so finding sources for those assertions shouldnt be too timeconsuming thanks for understanding,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUU14TjlTcHBHSHNlQkVxZXB2a29sajJvQzNxMHhmZHFkQmNSNk9rX0FWcVFZaXBjUlB6NXZuMGxMOEdIVVBiNG16RWowd3hJbXVvOW80d0RqcDJjdVE9PQ==

those assertions pretty much conclusions are the result of pages of analyses spanning several chapters of the book cited covering and analysing the structure of mass political parties as organisations drawing similarities between such parties and gangs in general the history of parties the structure of the proposed alternatives and how the proposed alternatives avoid devolving into similar party politics through a wide range of institutional electoral and other matters which all lead us to the conclusion stated unfortunately no other author i have studied has explored the question as well as coherently and with as much veracity as the source i have cited which itself cites many sources for varying issues which i cannot use because alone such sources do not repeat same analyses but only back the former with relevant evidence and i do not think i can find any source making the same analyses and thus drawing the same conclusions as the source i have cited i think your rules would thus greatly limit the education that your audience can access for instance if the present body of common literature is flawed or inadequate for any reason it assumes that every problem that will be presented here is a common and exhausted problem and does not make room for uniquechallenging ones with few answers out there i think attention should also be given to the arguments made but if these do not satisfy you then sure i only came to help you may do as you are inclined to do,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnV1B3ekEzV2x0N0FVLWowUFhLcjBweWI0Tklua3F3STlWN0NQTENNeDhGVWJBMzZEX3kxVmttcTZNM1FlNlF6LUcyNEljSjFpRGtSYkpGWlRjdWpHckE9PQ==
respectfully i have my doubts about some of these conclusions there are plenty of countries with more centralized power than the us<url> but less polarization<url> so its difficult to accept that the only meaningful answer to the problem of polarization is decentralization its also not clear that greater federal revenues or expenditures are even correlated with polarization as oecd nations go the us is comparatively low in taxation<url> below average as a share of gdp and about average in per capita revenue but by and large the countries with higher taxation arent suffering the detrimental partisan effects the comment ascribes to this attribute,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbTNQWG92Q0h1TVRuTFFtMVlQcmtTRmxnY2c0blRacV8yNlc0cmpldjFkQ2lEMVNqekdvYm9GSExub2ZOS1dwMFRfc0RrX1ZuYzN4OEVnZjVIY3RxNFE9PQ==
>ways to encourage a polarized population to engage in meaningful polite civil discussions honestly youre not going to be able to do that full stop people who you might want to sway and encourage polite discourse have no want to engage in that sort of conversation they want emotional clickbait rageinducing topics they operate on an emotional level not a mental one most of it typically pulls back to a single source which they will not budge on regardless of well placed ideaswords and factual evidence = ive gone back and forth with a llama<number> model specifically this one<url> on this topic a number of times the best thing weve come up with it dubbed cultural sabotage or a cultural virus working from the inside to slowly subvert stereotypesexpectationspreconceptionsetc granted there isnt a straight forward way of doing this which would make sense given the idea itself the main goal is to plant seeds of doubt in the mental states of people like this breaking them outside of their builtin notions and forcing them to view their ideas objectively but subtly not by directly targetingattacking their beliefs because thats ultimately what they get off on in the first place its tricky on how to go about this = memes are one method but its easy to misinterpret them possibly reinforcing their ideas it suggested echoing as well repeating dominant narratives with a subtle twist to create a sense of familiarity and discomfort cognitive dissonance induction is another suggestion which is backed by a paper<url> oddly enough i do not know enough to speak on it though you could go for the emotional approach as well since thats technically what they want anyways somehow tie your message which is to break preconceptions and old thought patterns to allow for critical thinking to a heavy emotion it would worm its way in their brain and hopefully do the job = at the end of the day youre trying to get someone who has no want to think to objectively view their thoughts and readjust them based on new information you cant do it directly i promise you have to create a brain worm in a sense and let them reprogram themselves i unfortunately dont have the answers but those are my thoughts on it,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbTRqcnRWVGpITWZUTzJGUTBlS0UwMGxyMzFWeGdibGh5d3hWZENfQnMwYmpBQ1FhMEktLWc4N2hNZDBJb0kwVFpqczRMb2RSUkRzcGc1X192aFFVNmpSTUppVlpzZ1JGMVlDc3VmNDZ6dDQ9

lol people assume so much you think by seating i mean where individual membersparties sit i mean no disrespect by the lol dont get me wrong to understand these things there are a complex web of issues you need to understand to have context for instance i would say that the speaker of the house should not be the speaker to understand why we need to go into the history of the speakers position in england you dont need an upper and lower house that is also a poorly copied work from england which had its reason for having those it wasnt due to intelligent design but circumstance now all that said the senators should rather be speakers to understand that i need to explain the grave vocabulary errors that scholars from the time of madison to joseph schumpeter of more recent times have made with the simple word representatives we dont even have the right understanding of that word our representatives dont actually act as representatives but it proposes that they now become speakers what you call the speaker should now be the president as it was in the beginning now when it comes to seating there should be no president or chairperson at the head with everyone facing him that it is also argued is an arrangement from old england which had its seating inspired by the chapel it initially used for house sessions the arrangement should more resemble that of a lecture hall there are reasons for all these that relate to the changed functions of all government officials that is proposed to be able to realize true democracy there are changes to how debates need to be conducted and like i said everything you know about parliamentcongress changes so am not just talking about which side a party sits in fact there can be no political parties as we know it in a true democracy these all raise huge questions attempting to answer them satisfactorily would require pages of analyses history etc my source is the tragedy called democracy in the st century <number> <url><url> the author goes great lengths to explain these details and offer further sources i already added that moderators rejected the first comment i dont know if this comment will be alive but under the circumstance theres little else i can do again if you are looking for solutions in common places youd think if solutions were common or reliable in existing literature wed have fixed these centuries old problem we need to begin to look and think outside the box,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnV1VHZmhpLWsteUxVU3VteVRNUnEzZi1INFZmTFF5cjY4ak5LMFlIUXVsczc0R2ZGeTItMzN6Mk9qemlmcjB4YnNCMDJIZFp6V1A2NFEwNUJhT0xVQVE9PQ==

thank you for restoring my comment the countries that are more centralized but less polarized than the us almost always have lower ethnic linguistic andor religious fractionalization<url> compared to the us the higher degree of cultural homogeneity in these countries allows them to be more centralized without causing as much tension because there are fewer cultural factions vying for power and more agreement on the proper path for their country this actually somewhat supports my point decentralization would allow for various regionsdemographics which have a lower degree of fractionalization to govern themselves in the way that they see fit in many cases this would likely take the form of a high degree of centralization of power within their regiondemographic the higher degree of cultural homogeneity within the regiondemographic would help prevent hostility and polarization edit the population of countries in europe<url> are relatively on par with the population of states in the us<url> with a few exceptions those exceptions are generally still much more culturally homogeneous than the us according to the above source,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMTFHLU5uWjYzeE9ZMVhVUXk4aXRaVzdfSzFRUVRNUEY0TWlYUEhvOVkyZjc0RFZ0NkhhNXdueWJjdE9iS2wtWHFEalRmWm14ZjdnalJHQWNrQTdJU1FUTzhSZDYwRWtHVjltbTB0LV9nVVU9
my source is <url><url> i will try to answer your first comment if anyone can raise an issue only the richest will be able to promote said issue to gain enough popular awareness and support to get it passed only the richest will be able to afford psychological profiling media targeting mass advertising etc etc both to craft their desired policy in just the right language that is both broadly appealing and accomplishing their goal and then to message that policy to the amenable masses the proposed system for true democracy provides that the parliamentary body lets call that the assembly receives motions through various sources citizens can channel them through their representatives and which representatives are bound by law to respond their constituents or individually as groups etc the secretariat of the assembly is responsible to coordinating motions such that the various parties to issues are able to harmonize their arguments where there are similarities etc now the important thing is that when it comes to debates debates are not handled by the representatives in the assembly the issues are debated by the parties to that issue its promoters everyone has a hearing therefore at this assembly and the debates at the assembly are not via long presentations like many such parliaments have today it is in a more structured format much like we see in courts the assembly is where you win votes and argue your case not with ad campaigns your ads can be ripped apart as propaganda if it is at the debates in any case because in this environment the prevailing system would be issue politics it creates difficulties for people to invest in growing mass parties it will invariably become a costly and wasteful expense that is besides the fact that laws will also be used to prevent the development of mass parties as we know it parties may still exist but not the kinds we know today every issue is multifaceted and dealt with on many fronts i simply cannot exhaust entire constitutional matters which comprehensively produce the goals stated,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWGE4N2VtX3VSdmpUY3lHWFRVRjlpWllwYnJtOU5yUFZmUG1yQlRvQzJ5V0VyU1FUWk1DaG15NjBpX1V3a082dlE3Y1FhVFJseVdxNUw4STFDLVVqRWc9PQ==

this persons idea is just separating people in an impossible way without certain states become far right while everyone living there doesnt are we intending some great partition like event forcing people on the left into blue areas and conservatives to red areas its not a real idea its just fascism with more steps theyll control their areas and than expand as they always do why are we even entertaining it as a solution,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVGh4ODk5MFhEV2w3eWtRSUZTTnJzTDZxczhjRTAwbTVPdVZ3TDg2UjMxeEdCT0ZIcnpHaEVBYVMyOUc5UkxzUGR6TzhsNFRkS25PS1BvOTFBSUpBZnc9PQ==

it should be selfevident that a twoparty system would be more polarized than a multiparty system as we are seeing in this current election cycle the democratic pitch for biden as president is partially simply that hes not trump though i would argue hes genuinely better than any republican candidate they could have offered if there were more than two choices such a strategy wouldnt be as useful source for this concept<url> so how does one introduce more parties into the american democracy we have to change the voting and representation systems the voting system must satisfy the sincere favorite criterion<url> so that voters can always give their favorite maximum support i prefer approval voting<url> for many reasons but there are other choices the representation system must use proportional representation<url> wherever possible a natural progression for singlewinner approval is to use sequential proportional approval voting<url> for proportional voting and selection this kind of change is slow but so is all meaningful change the landmark events you see in the headlines were preceded by years of organized work by dedicated people with this kind of change youre taking power away from entrenched parties so there will be opposition you start at the local level and work your way up pushing things through with referendums when necessary fargo and st louis recently switched your city or state could be next if you put on the work,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM1piTXVzbzNacjd2NjdXVlptbC10cThGUk9DRGlCbmxsWTVlZzdiUExRdzFWc3V0cHZ2TzNLVjVDMHE0dUdhNnE2T3FZZmh2YTlWbm04cE9UWUotamc9PQ==

ok im not sure what platform youre on but i know i did not lock this post and its not showing as locked for me ill paste the text below in case you want it ok this is super random but the world is so disjointed and seems to forget about facts if its not in a pretty picture right so my thought was something like this may already exist if so chat feel free to roast and supply link pls thx i just want to get like every single final vote tally like at the end of those super boring hearings and screenshot and caption for rulings that hurt everyday people the most print them out and when anybody asks about my thoughts i can just prove or disprove them without even speaking but i dont know where to find this cataloged i dont care about sides i do care about facts voting records are just factual things to help people know the reality in which their politicians behave and they can vote according to their own beliefs just unfortunately the fairness doctrine was axed and that made it legal for the news to lie to us so things still relevant today like raising the minimum wage im sure there were <number> different times its gone to the floor where its like all <number> r nays and even like ish d nays for all <number> times its gone to vote or like depending on how far the videos go back the ruling that made corporations people the ruling that made money into speech thats like ish right maybe if not on video just finding any reference that can be photoed and all filed together like if someone made that into an instagram page it could be rad ideally records go far enough back that we could show the stark comparison of corruption beforeafter pac money became legalized that could even show when bribery became unrecognized by the government idk would that then mean at that point we would need corresponding data on how much pac money each congress person or even better those could be like individual congress person baseball cards has the persons name then per year and corresponding information on how much dark moneypac money they took in the little stat number recangle graph rookie year retirement years sidenotes can just have scandals like a batting avg but its a corruption avg lol have an avg per year finally an all time avg little  to indicate if there were years the politician didnt take bribes pac money holographic if they never took pac money sorry i lost the plot but yeah basically just looking for hella screenshots so i can show people and be like heres the numbers you think this side did it well heres your guys doing exactly what you dont like or even if you like the side is this an issue they usually side with if not and they randomly voted terriblywas it moneyed influences bc a lot of people will literally never see who blocked it while both sides claim to be good guys or take credit for good things when they vote the opposite like mtayg does but yeah literally just screenshot + the judgement it was about by name preferably with breakdowns of judgement too hopefully this hasnt been asked many times lol,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna09aMldpb0J6Nm0zMllKR2IwM0RqZVRmUFJxTkdxX3ZjMGxqTDZKM1Bjc3NGWlhkSXZ2SVlkcThhV0lqVzRpb3hJeVhyM2p3TV9SMkowbU9Ua0RUeHc9PQ==
blaming the other side without acknowledging any faults from their own side is probably not the best approach to reduce polarization which is what op was asking about as an outside observer european that dont get to vote on any of this im seeing plenty of wrongs being done by people from both sides the rhetoric in american politics is off the rails and you are trying to demonize and label each other even in the neutral politics forum i dont envy your options in this election and i dont know how to fix it but i suppose it could have been better if there were more than two parties then you could have middle ground parties to vote for if the extremes are too far away from what you like,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0tzRnZydkljYm9IVW55VmpKQ2RwbU1COXlLTXJsV0FQLS12X1N2c1JvSXJCSUQ0TnRWYjBqNW43WXBxZU41aXEzbmwwTHZVVC1qc0diY0sxYXhsVGc9PQ==

i mean what they are saying about republicans is not untrue not in the slightest theres no demonizing going on there its just the facts that said and i realize the contradiction here i dont think its constructive to keep making that point the problem is theres hawkdove game theory going on here republicans always make the hawk play there is no way to depolarize solely through being the adult in the room so its both not productive to point out what republicans are doing rhetorically and also not productive to seek common ground because republicans will always exploit any openings democrats are perpetually stuck between taking the high road and letting the right do what it wants and taking the low road and giving the right fodder for their propaganda machine again im not blaming anyone here thats just the power dynamic that has developed thats just how it works,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVVh0a2M4MmtWYnF4RXFWNUFxWlM0S2t6SUJpTUxWZzVCSTlOcW95a3JMSkVTamZrVS1sdWRHY0VvOE04VEhtaWYtTUQ1M2lrcWl4cEdOZDZXZlNfLWc9PQ==
a few quotes from the pew research article<url> that you linked >for decades gender race and ethnicity and religious affiliation have been important dividing lines in politics this continues to be the case today >republicans and democrats do not just hold different beliefs and opinions about major issues they are much more different racially ethnically geographically and in educational attainment than they used to be >as has long been the case white voters are much more likely than those in other racial and ethnic groups to associate with the republican party hispanic and asian voters tilt more democratic black voters remain overwhelmingly democratic >the relationship between partisanship and voters religious affiliation continues to be strong especially when it comes to whether they belong to any organized religion at all >the gap between voters who identify with an organized religion and those who do not has grown much wider in recent years heres an excerpt from a foreign affairs article<url> about polarization in the us >polarization in the united states is especially multifaceted in most cases polarization grows out of one primary identity divisionusually either ethnic religious or ideological in kenya for instance polarization feeds off fierce competition between ethnic groups in india it reflects the divide between secular and hindu nationalist visions of the country but in the united states all three kinds of division are involved >the clash that emerged in the s and s between progressive and conservative worldviews had a strong ideological componentespecially when compared to the era of consensus politics that came immediately before that said race was and continues to be a major fault lineone that cannot and should not be ignored and religion matters too movements in the s and s to legalize abortion to increase access to birth control and to ban statesponsored prayer in public schools brought religion directly into political debates and decisions >this powerful alignment of ideology race and religion with partisanship renders americas divisions unusually encompassing and profound it is hard to find another example of polarization in the world that fuses all three major types of identity divisions in a similar way,r/neutralpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndmxEOXlId2ltMXIzb3U1TU1EZnlaWEZQem5DdVlqVUJhT3RKSmpsck1PY1FITVFES1MzRWxiakxuZTdxbnFOU0l2aVFDQldMVGFKdTAzVTcwYkphU2Z5cnFhbFk3MU9rdVV5cmE3UUYxVlk9
