as opposed to that tourism that aims for unfriendly foreigners that everyone else has s this just felt like a silly thing to make a whole headline about when its the goal of all tourism lol,r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3VmNDI0M0R0UDBUQ2ttdS1EMlpEYnFWR25OY0o0TWk3T1JRY2dsN1FjaFJXTjhyUFlaVzJuVVJzRm9ueE9zWjZxaFZMdF9jLUdpMlJPTHY4ZjJYTHc9PQ==
theyre trying to say that the friendly foreigners line is suggesting that theyll only allow foreigners from friendly countries russia china i feel like they might be reading a bit too deeply into it though because they could just mean that they want foreigners who are friendly which is how you interpreted it,r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNkcxekZuN0NmNzVaa1VOT0FLanoyRS1Sek9JTWNKS0U0OUpDalVRMnRNZm1ocWhyeWxJbEdWWnloVi1nZ0I3cGhBajVRX0w5NlFZQ2g4R0ZLc0sxZHdzT0c2X2Vha1BBbXpQQWY2enZpUWs9
for what seems like a long time ago many people from western countries were allowed in and often people in the us were able to get in who were dual citizens with canada using their canadian passport i remember the vice guide to north korea from long ago talking about how they got in by bribing the consulate in china and then had to attend some sort of dinner where they were told most of the people attending were actually north koreans who were vetting them to see if they were cool or not,r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhbHl5QnlJRmVfWFA0ZWZsQ2p5RUM4YWhkcE9VcnRBOW5ra0gzbU1pSVppSmxZZ1hsWWxMMTBWbE9vd2syY0ZzOXVBUDk3Q3BqUkc3VkFicDZ0YWFOSmc9PQ==
im a us citizen and i was able to visit via a tour operator in china without bribing anyone or being made to attend a special dinner it took the nk consulate in shenyang longer to approve my visa than it did the europeans in my tour group and i had to fly in rather than entering by train like the rest of the group but that was the extent of the extra trouble i had to go to i had a tour guide or minder if you prefer all to myself because they had to have him meet me at the airport but being able to have a bunch of oneonone conversations with him turned out to be the best part of the trip that was in <number> so i cant speak for how things are now but it wasnt too far from the time of the vice video i dont think they lied about anything per se but my sense watching that video was that they were straining really hard to present their packaged group tour like some kind of james bond adventure,r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWTJjY2Nqa1h5a3NhcWRlUlRrdjFyRVpQb2xTS2RxZ1VuZE9POHRjeXliTVdGbTBXU2JkQTlpRGJvWXVqUzlTZGFRMHNiZGZUWjdpUzJOTzRwZUVqZnc9PQ==
very interesting ive heard that basically if you behave yourself and use some common sense you will have no issue its something ive always thought would be interesting to do but then there is the argument that for every dollar you spend as a tourist you are supporting the regime and with the current political climate i think i will watch from afar i think for the vice guys they probably figured out they were up to something and put them through extra scrutiny,r/northkoreanews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYkkxQW9OZ1VOcWhSOW1tUmxuZ205VWQ2VndpVlRlOXlzUU9FR3YyOXlZZGhtc21DUzkxbkhnb0dSY0tmUFFpVks3VVBwVDlQZjJVYlpTNlUzb2xfYmc9PQ==
