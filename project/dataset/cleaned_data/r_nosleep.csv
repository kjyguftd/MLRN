if you dont have enough work credits you get nothing you dont qualify so no benefits for you period they dont care what the reasons are and during the time period your application is under review you cant make more than <cur><number>month and you cant have done so for the previous six months before applying or else its an automatic rejection some case workers automatically reject any case thats working at all and even though its illegal youd have to prove it to sue otherwise you have to go through the appeals process it took me a year and a half to get to where i had the option to appeal but i hadnt officially been rejected yet and the lawyers i had hired told me not to appeal until we had to because it would only further delay a decision that could potentially be an approval it took another nine months to get that approval while my application just sat in limbo and no theres not a damn thing you can do to make things go faster if you have enough work credits your payments still might not make it past poverty level i know because thats where my disability benefits started out you also dont immediately qualify for medicare or medicaid if your state didnt choose to expand medicaid to cover the income gap for obamacare too bad fuck you just dont get sick for the <number><number> years it takes for your newly disabled ass to qualify for government health insurance i only barely am not below poverty level because every year they give everyone a costofliving adjustment its usually a couple percentage points behind retirement benefits so that recordbreaking year when everyone in retirement got a <number> or <number> increase yeah the people on disability got <number> which was twice as much as the <number> we had gotten for the previous decade but it still felt like a pretty direct fuck you for being a useless sickly bastard,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCLWNPaWl6a2FOaDloXzNwc1p0SkxGWE5ZWkNqUlh4WnpraEpUNTJDYXhqUm5hOW9NX3UtMC1oU25XS3ZkVmVjblppY1RyQlNoM0xUS3QwX0MzMENBNER2bV85ZnBFb19aLUFHN2ZSVjlZVXM9
unfortunately it sounds like you got anxious attachement style trust is about not knowing her location and trusting she wont cheat love yourself it would suck but what if she isnt cheating and your behavior is pushing her away what if she doesnt like feeling like being in a prison where all her movement is always watched by a camera perhaps she likes to have her own time a relationship is about <number> individuals living their own lives and sharing it not co depending on each other if she is cheating it hurts but she doesnt deserve you however your current scheme thinking process is scaring me i will not judge but it sounds like you need to know where she is at all times this sounds suffocating have you ever considered that your actions influenced and impacted people around you but also its good to trust yourself however depending on many aspects of your lives yourself sometimes is wrong is it in your case i do not know edit i have anxious attachment style too and i have been told so it hurts but if you have it its not the end of the world it is not your fault reality is not objective it is subjective to whatever we make it be you are in control of yourself your behavior and your emotions have you deeply checked within yourself i understand it is hard at your young age i struggled too perhaps you could have a discussion with her on how you feel and what you are thinking finding a middle ground is usually possible if both parties want and openly discussed about stuff im <number> male btw,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCWTlFOFJCdFZnR1dtcHQzOUs2bDBGdlV1dFJncHY3QUppczZCekJTOU5jS3FvVWZVQlJsVS0yeDE0a19Ocmw0X0tiR2RqQmhDWldlcE1LN1BsTXdvNHc9PQ==

your feeling of protection is valid you love her and want the best for her there are many options you could do people dont change unless they want to what if she still goes drinking in her s and get drunk it might or might not happen but you only have control over yourself you are allowed to put boundaries and dislike her behavior you are welcome to share or not what you think of feel but you arent allowed to control her the question is what will you do today communication and boundaries are healthy example i am happy for you that you are going out and having fun however i do not appreciate to having to pick you up drunk or your untrustworthy behavior of kissing other people i am scared of your drinking problem from past experiences i know you have been kissing other people that is cheating if you do not want to be with me i would understand and accept it if you stay with me but you end up cheating a second time i will have no choice but to move on from our relationship then the decision of keeping her behavior or changing is on her side after that you give her the power but you shared your authentic self to her it is scary as fuck but this probably the most healthy way edit you are also allowed to leave her if you wanted it seems like trust is not there and it is understandable you do you but if you give her a chance it is your decision first and foremost obviously i am not expert in relationships and im not a psychologist professional take my things for granted im a human like you with just a little more time spent on earth,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCeEs4Qy1zNUE0TWRhRDlFUVhlYkxFX0xmb2s4REVMaWRvWHd0UVBURUYxX3kyMHNya2w2STlwRHp5UjNsZmN5Yzk4UlJfd3otYU91Q3FNWGlRZ2ZGb2c9PQ==

of course i used to own a painting by herbert mullin when i was younger but i lost it over the years i also have a copy of the die song a totally awesome book about him every homo sapiens communicates telepathically its just not accepted socially herbert mullin like the zodiac he also believed that killing people would help him in the next life as well as preventing earthquakes the more people he killed the more powerful he would be when reincarnated which is similar to the zodiac quote i like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forest because man is the most dangerous animal of all to kill something gives me the most thrilling experience it is even better than getting your rocks off with a girl the best part of it is that when i die i will be reborn in paradise and all i have killed will become my slaves i will not give you my name because you will try to slow down or stop my collecting of slaves for my afterlife,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCM3FlSWpiaEFTMFVBZjZQZE8tcGdTeVlMVm5fcVUwSXg5X3FKaTZlcUdUcXA0TS12YnRibzZQOW9MWTlvM3RDNFRtY1UyQXFtOV80OW5ER3cxUTlkQ1E9PQ==

medicare is a two year wait i have been on social security disability not supplemental social security disability and yes supplemental social security disabiltiy insurance is available regardless of work credits but very low it also has a family income requirement and if your spousepartner makes too much money your application is denied work credits count for the regular one like i have though i would have been better off if i had been diagnosed and sick enough a few years earlier it would have made a couple hundred dollars a month difference i am baffled what is going on where you havent gotten any ruling yet are you in reconsideration i was in a state that was experimenting with dropping it entirely because it is rarely reversed the original process is kind of fascinating the application is received by the ss office they wait for all documentation requests then send it to a state evaluator i have read that some states use other states evaluators instead of having their own my state has their own the state evaluator goes through the entire application and measures it against certain benchmarks you can have a disabling disease but still be able to work ie you are early in disease process and have a sedentary job that doesnt get messed up by the current symptoms i was diagnosed for a disease i had from childhood in my early s the last several jobs i had had i was always on the edge of dismissal because of so many sick days if the state evaluator says you qualify it goes back to ss who reviews it and either does final approval or rejects it they pull random rejections for audit but not many if you request a review from your first rejection social security pulls your rejected file and reviews to see if youre qualified i helped someone else with my disease get approval with reconsideration with them experimenting with ending it i am not sure if it still exists but yes there are limits on how much you can work because the benefit is supposed to be for those who cannot work enough to support themselves it is the whole reason for it in order to have an application considered you have to have been diagnosed and unable to work at least six months,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCZkdVeTloLWlUNzAzOEZ6MFBYbndUTDJVcFFJaGZtS3phdWtjaDhIZEZjSFBlV3JseHRuVFJaM3p5VDQzek5lMkVwMm9SUXJxZmZHOUhVd3BHLU5VMmc9PQ==

i wasnt able to find anything about there ever being a mining operation on mount everest or any of the people mentioned but i was able to find something that i hope can be of some use if its still ongoing as you say it makes sense its being kept secret as its not legal according to the unesco world heritage convention site the mountain is part of sagarmatha national park and has been protected by unesco since <number> deemed a world heritage site and thus making mining illegal there what that doesnt explain is why the operation wasnt discussed in <number> when it was still legal as for the rubies it is very likely the team actually found some there have been small deposits found in ganesh himal nepal and the area is very close to mount everest according to the source i found it was found in the s but that does mean its possible there could be more rubies out there somewhere in the nearby vicinity that just havent been discovered or in this case publicly reported regarding the thing calling alexis and dragging someone into the tunnels i believe that he was simply seeing and hearing things as a result of delirium from possibly being made to feel isolated by incompetent people anger prolonged exposure to intense weather conditions desperation for the new drill everyone else that had quit probably cracked under the pressure and left hansel that never came back from the tunnels may have met a similar fate to alexis and lost his mind may have even gotten lost in the tunnels especially if he went in alone considering the tunnels were dark and cold it may have been a last straw and its even a possibility he may have committed suicide in there that part of the journal is very much reminiscent of the lost footage from the paris catacombs if youve ever seen it the person wanders into a forbidden area of the catacombs while filming gets lost and at the very end freaks out drops their camera and runs away in a panic where it lay until the battery died no one knows what happened to them afterward in case youre wondering the camera was only found years later and its believed the person may have suffered delirium as a result of being alone in a dark confusing place with nothing but a camera a theory as to why it was never discussed could be that the higher ups knew there were plans to make mount everest a protected area could have happened since it was made protected not too long after the journal entries took place and so decided to keep the whole project a secret knowing they wanted to milk the mountain for its resources for a good while do you know where these documents and journal were obtained someone had to have recovered them for them to be found maybe the journal was even just meant to be a novel made by someone simply trying to pass the time in a difficult environment sources <url> <url>,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRCZG1RMmhSZHRURDFHLVR0RDY2NVlzZndQc0NCUGlSeUxPSmNrLWNsczlsZnV1c2NobVdFRVJqZVg1aDFYamNpTGZsRHJhd0ttQzFDQWEySzhZUC04emlzUV9XdUdJVEIyeERCeFFaeDBNdmM9

so when you say the devil was holding up his fishnets with suspenders are you talking about what the english would call braces or what americans would call garters because both of them are called suspenders and the devil in fishnet thighhighs and a garter belt is a very different image from the devil in fulllength fishnet tights and the other kind of suspenders one might make access to the mystery back pocket rather easier for one thing sorry there is a way to get maria back i dont know what it is but i am confident you can do this and yes its probably gonna require hammering the stake into the tree in the graveyard be a bit too coincidental for the devil to give you that instruction right before this without it being related given his folkloric role and all right,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLTU1Gc1YzVzhzcVZnVlpUS0FqZE1SSWNBUS1aTUc2cGFtdUFOaHdqX2xtOGRkemJFdzBZMTh1UlZyVE5FX2M0cjZCdjhQRTd1ajNhV0NDekEwVGJKa3c9PQ==

ok here is my theory when the pool was first mentioned it was told that a boy jumped into it and then came back out and never had an issue with the inhumane on campus ever again im betting it was james grayson the inhuman im betting used to be the stabbed student so when james reemerged from the pool unharmed and having no more issues with anything on campus its seems to me that grayson then asked the forgetter to take all memories of james away and then introduced himself to everyone as grayson leaving james lost now james is back but in marias body now with the forgetter gone you should address maria as james see what reaction you get,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLRjJwUzFxUmktWlNHS2dZbnNjaEhyNmFLYjNIQlRrYmYyeFA5eGt6ektoT0huMUFvbzhwY3pfU3BadklyQ1k1NHZmZ3BLRE9sNERhTUNaRU5DYXNmWVE9PQ==

hmm hmm a website that lets you date monsters well sure humans have a fear of insects because of how different they are humans are known to suspect the different from their group mostly because of an evolutionary trait whatever was not in the tribe it was against it in a way any monster looking to date a human should look into this aspect of human existence if the human strives to fight their natural instinct to eliminate the unknown then thats to be supported just as it is hard for ceran to hold his instincts to hunt i think honestly both of you should work to fight your instincts im not excusing ceran either jokes about eating op dont support ops subconscious to accept the unknown maybe look to first give care and love so the main idea communicate say what your instincts tell you when you look at each other then look to control them this is also a life lesson too as a kitsune myself ive learnt that holding control over your instincts will get you farther that giving in yeah mocking human traditionalism and overall dumb actions is entertaining but its immature also learn to support one another in your development yes op your life might be short beyond my comprehension type of short but surely you can work on growing right maybe at least to live on as a memory in ceran if you develop up to that point,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRMUFZNWWNIcFRFVHR0NU9NdTI2endVZ0NzSmpFZkJGMldzaXF3Z3dqSTJsUWMxU2czNFdZUUhDRGlid3Vub0FCV2RmeFBzS0ZtcVFfV2FOUWZTOEtEZWc9PQ==

if we assume the videos are in chronological order then the <number> year old would be a different kid since in the video you recognized yourself in you were about <number> so far it appears as though the man abducted op but looks can be deceiving sometimes the video of the couple with the baby only said lucky that could mean that the man was lucky to have found a baby he liked and was planning on abducting or just that the family was lucky because they had a baby the use of masks and makeup is interesting to me it seems like the man in the videos was trying to train the child to love the feminine style makeup for some reason wanted to be a mother instead of a father trying to scare him with the devil mask makes sense since he seems to be a very religious person maybe the woman makeup is meant to look like an angel that would explain the increasing frustration that the boy hated it so much,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRWRWtidmdFeTJPb2gtVWpFRm9kN1ExcWF4Yks4Y1luUk5xUm9JYnV3bVYzZHVOTDVqUWxDREtzbWJMWXMxMHVHR01hTEwxSjVSQ2VYYWEyQ2xxQ2lCdkE9PQ==

haley needs to decide if shes going to fight or flight oddly enough either way she needs to do some detecting obviously if shes going to try to engage and eventually stopdefeat this shadow ash entity she needs to understand not only the why but also the how its doing what its doing otherwise everything shell attempt will simply be a bandaid instead of a cure if shes going to hide then she still needs to figure out this dark creature apparently this thing can get to her wherever she is she moves in with her family and all of a sudden there are power outages so in reality hiding doesnt work but if she knew why this being is doing what its doing and how its doing it shed in my opinion would have more of a chance of avoidance and survival i feel like shed have to somehow find out what happened to jack shadow ash snapped his neck an entity like that who kills doesnt exactly shock me but even after he was dead he dragged him back to wherever shadow ash came from why he obviously still needs jack for some reason i dont think hes afraid of the cops so hes trying to hide the body lol i feel like thats a big key if haley can figure out what shadow ash is doing with jack she could save herself and lastly has this thing attacked others can she go online and search for accounts from people with the samesimilar stories how long has this been going on is there some sort of a pattern of who he attacks does he attack the same way each time does he only take men or women and children too does he always make the one hes taking bound and gag the other heshe is sleeping with has anyone else found out anything about this thing like a weakness of any kind maybe this shadow ash figure is being controlled by something even more evil i hope haley can stay strong she sounds like a strong and resourceful woman,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZRDRnb0dZZ2wtMHVTOGk5WE5SQnRfZ3J5TlRwajVnUTNzRzdXS21TRE9uWHVzLTlrTURkbW9nbHdiT3BwNG5MWEVTWjlGa3NsVkd6bGtPdk9sU2kwbFE9PQ==

as the other comments noted have you shown the notes and played the voicemails for your friends family and the police if you have did you ask them what they read on the notes and heard on the voicemails because them all saying it sounds like stress makes me wonder if they see anything on the notes or hear anything on the voicemails in truth every single one of us live in a world of our own perceptions and sometimes things that one person perceives cannot be perceived by others something you might like to do to ensure safety is voluntarily enter a hospital this will not only put you into an environment which is entirely controlled and therefore out of reach of your stalker but will also allow you to avail yourself of professional people who have a lot of experience with differing perceptions as your entry is voluntary you will have the right to leave at any time assuming youre in the us or canada or several members of the eu just be sure to communicate fully with someone you completely trust so they understand what youre doing and why it might even be wise to give that trusted person temporary and limited to medical decisions power of attorney so they can act on your behalf and advocate for you should there be any unexpected developments at the very least if your stalker is as persistent as they appear to be they might reveal themselves by trying to gain access to continue to surveille you you may be able to flush them out good luck,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmcXZhcHFETEw5VExIM0Z3YW52eEZxaW1BSmgyTElhRHlIVDNPajBGd3hmNVFvNXVOanRZcW5xb0NGZmFBZUh4RmJfQ3JFZS1IVFVZUTE5VVBJd1ZVdUE9PQ==

my understanding of it is that dorothy was a good person but she always sensed the presence of the prisoner whod killed himself in the bathroom <number> years prior she got too curious and went there the spirit possessed her and killed people at the park then killed dorothy all a month before op started working there her spirit came back to make sure the next person could protect the shelter and didnt fall victim to the spirit like she did tim saw this and dipped like a smart person even though she meant no harm she was able to be friendly to the spirits in the park because they all understand that they were killed by the same guy and it wasnt dorothys fault,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRqWXFkSkhEc2pSY0k5akZtdDFJUEJKU2JibUxORHBXellPQkEwNGZYVUxlVm5QMmdqOHFwOUVuemROeGM4b19oaW4tN3I3OFA3aVB1VzdpUFJlZnNzbEE9PQ==

youre oh so worried about someone preying on your child that you wont have them live in a group home but your son hands you a shopping list he never could have written and your reaction is damn this is gonna be expensive what the hell this story is just one example after another of parental failure your son has absolutely no ability to accept no as an answer no emotional regulation no selfsoothing skills and virtually no coping skills whatsoever because anytime he even begins to experience a negative emotion daddy comes along to placate him thats not parenting thats how you create an adult toddler who knows he can get whatever he wants whenever he wants it because all he has to do is flail around hard enough this is seemingly the only thing youve taught him and you better unteach it soon otherwise it really does end in a nightmare,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxZldBWnNKQTIydDVVM000TWM4VjFYRDd4d2hfMC1XN00yY3hVRndkdmdIN1VQeF9EZVNyVzAtYjJjZFFUTzZJcFpnY0o1SjJiaHJ2X1VTak1fZ3B2UVhEbnFqSk8tamxRUkFfUlI1TDlQbzQ9

never get in between a man and his woman you first dig for more information to find out if what you were thinking was right or she is just thin but when you judged her knowing thats his first gf you calling her sick was a bridge too far men leave their parents over a woman and so who are you not the right place or time to talk about her looks before you get to know her she probably knew that you made comments about how she looks and that was the end for you and him it was either you or her next time when a guy introduces you to their woman you go with the flow because everyone has an opinion but never say anything bad at all unless you want to lose a friend people may ask you what you do think about their bfgf just be positive or give your honest opinion and kiss your friendship goodbye they dont need your opinion in <number> of cases they just want confirmation to a decision they already made that opinion is this i like her very much or she is beautiful and end of story remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder not yours,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzY2lwWk9wOFBlV3FoTWIwcmNWeDdZQVc4ejFGbGR0amRhbzk2ekY1UzZ3bG9Hc1F0NHlkYTU2RkY3VVBXVk1PRmpQaGU4QWEyUlJib2hEV3NCd1ZOMGRNVU5ndDdyS3AwOUxGRGxkWEhtYWs9

maybe go to the police and ask them to click the link on a business computer im sure they have enough necessary resources and firepower to stop whatever decides to come to the station even if they dont they would likely put it at the top of their list to figure out whats going on as for links regarding other businesses id just suggest going into the establishments and speaking with someone instead hope these little tips help and good luck,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ0cGF1X21JYzk4SWhTRnVyU2VhZEZjS0VxRUctNDBvRmFTOWtNMUgtYlo5bDdSbkdiTEltUGtncUVMMkVkaG84clVLancwaWpCRG5jTWdZbEpDWVNnZ3c9PQ==

hmm it doesnt seem like james is outwardly hostile to you he seems like he did what he did only out of sheer survival instinct that makes him dangerous in that he may stab you in the back to survive later but it does also mean that hes not malicious maybe you can find a way to make is so that grayson will be powerful enoughfree enough to become his own thing without needing james body if thats the case maybe james will be willing to help you get maria back once he knows he is safe at least id say communicate to him your plans to help and steps you are taking this might prevent him from taking action too hastily he could even help another hand is often a helpful thing just be careful to remember his potential for opportunist betrayal if you also help grayson be free he will be more able and willing to cooperate and could become a very powerful ally he does seem like he cares about you in his own entity type of way but maybe thats just a facade kates stories often gave me the impression that these supernatural entities often do appreciate kindness and will return favors so maybe that pattern is followed here its a though situation neither of them are necessarily wrong for wanting what they do hopefully you can work together to find a solution to help everyone,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ1MU5tMHJXVjhzanRIb0dhTk5OSW0wa0xoY2NSTFZWOG55ZTkwLTFtcy1ISXdiTlpNR1k0RHdOMDN4UXRkNmdKWXpBOFlRSlNrZ3NUejVSc1FHcTZ1LVE9PQ==

awesome story shitty experience it takes time to heal and to learn to trust again but lily moved extremely fast so you can always just watch for those signs when you do decide to date again and your date doesnt actually have to be a date to get to know people if you find someone interesting start off with an afternoon coffeeor a stroll in the park and get to know each other and take things slow if she doesnt respect your boundary of wanting to move slow you dont need to tell her what happened on the first hang out session once again if she doesnt press you for infothan that also shows shes respecting your boundaries good luck its rough out there but theres still some diamonds in the rough especially when your meeting people the good og style in person,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBQ1FuVUNQR2MtZkZHbmNCN3pLWHF1TnJtZFZXaWhpZzVxNU5CRWpqbkEwaU9qX1FIcHZDTjhEV2czSW5jSUp2WFZJc0YyTldSaklOUFN4V2RWN1hGUUE9PQ==

first i just want to extend a big heartfelt hug i can only imagine what this has been like for all involved secondly i was intrigued to read your post because ive thought of doing this same thing to adopt a second child my first pregnancy and second with a miscarriage was horrendous with <number><number> nausea and vomiting my husband would love another baby but i cant do it thirdly my son is now <number> and very extremely highly sensitive and now that hes <number> his testosterone is revving up they say between <number><number> its as high as a mans if thats helpful if your child is a boy anyway ive turned to conscious parenting methods and if youd like to chat <number><number> i could share some resources that might be helpful but i say this because its the only way my son is responsive and learns my husband still has some of his own child upbringing parenting methods that he swears by but they do him and our son no good we are looking at some behavioral therapy because my son will get very sticky and want to repeat things over if they havent gone his way among some other behavioral things when hes mad hitting biting scratching screaming while normal for his age and hopefully growing out of it hard to manage when different parenting methods okay so all that being said i have family trauma that i have been working hard to overcome my whole life almost y and they say trauma is past down generation to generation until you change this could be contributing to your child the stressstate of the mothers nervous system prior to conception + while pregnant plays a huge part in the childs also im going to say this as gently as possible because i also have a heart to adopt and something im trying to come to terms with a childs separation from its mother is the biggest threat on the childs life their very existence to live is taken from them could this earth shattering scream be their deep grief for their mother they might not even know it because you are their mother but its biological for this i dont have any advice as im still trying to figure it out i hope something if anything i shared helps sending you so much love grace and peace,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBazZYYmlnT0Mxb0JyQUxxZWlGckFUbGU1SDJlOUI4SVZnTmV2azFpRnUtQWstOUVqNjYyR0NodDRySXhKVGdWVE1VTjQwQUg5d1pIMkxZYnE3Nl82enc9PQ==

wow so everytime your child gets frustrated they cause fairly severe property damage or physical damages to people that seriously hurts them your seriously going to send them unattended by either of you to possibly extremely frightening confusing surroundings filled w a bunch of little children a ton of private property any and all toys and furniturewindows in the classroom while anytime your child gets frustrated they have the ability to destroyincapacitate and seriously harm others this is a lawsuit or possible jailtime for you guys from the possibility of her causing irrevocable harm to anyone near her or the same area its in what happens if she puts the teacher or a kidkids in the hospital or causes thousands in property damage no offence but this child seems like perfect candidate for possible tutorhomeschooling while trying to socialize with other kids while under your <number> complete supervision for the safety of anyone and everyone near this child,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCQVNETjhSVHVHZ1ZzcDZ6Qm1VNlJJN0hpTDJZUlJnT3RyRzF0REV5OTV2ajExN1lYNUI3anEtMGgxTE0xYmc2Rk9wVDFUMDBXc3NXN2todjM5LUh5aVE9PQ==
given that the screams are causing damage to people things that is unlikely banshees have been done dirty by pop culture a banshees wail while plenty loud is not any more dangerous than a humans scream a banshee is a type of fey who often live in the basements or attics of humans they sustain themselves on the emotional energy of their housemates much in the same way that plants sustain themselves on sunlight they are also able to sense when someone is getting close to death which is why they scream or more accurately keen this is to let others know that someone around them is going to pass away soon letting them emotionally prepare for that moment source an old college buddy had a banshee as a housemate she lived in his basement and was pretty chill everyone called her granny making me think that she was his grandma until i saw old photos of her from the turn of the century looking no different than she does now,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCSy12b2ZJR2E2OFluM0JTdG5XQkFfZVpVTVhLaHdRQS1RWUFESWFEQWUydWpVcE5VQnRVR2lEdjlFQ01XV0JaSUctNnNpUlA2c1BBOEdkZWduUUFJMWc9PQ==
sorry to do a whole um akshully post as for something a bit more constructive does your child like to eat the same things as youd expect for a kid their age do they eat more or less than other kids their age if their bio mom is not human then it is likely that she had different dietary needs which your child might have inherited if we can figure that out that will help identify what either the bio mother or bio father for that matter is which will then lead to determining the best course of action for your child oh and other than the screams and the general quietness does your child do anything that is not typical for a kid their age,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCSG1QV2p5TllrbHF1TFlfUC01bFhoRmhXT19vWHlnTlZlNU5fR2V4SmFaV1ZnMTZOTFFvZUZrbDhuUFc3V0M0MWFlYVg2ei1TTG80VTVGYkJJWFFOcVE9PQ==

oh yea i remember that diplomats case the one who insisted in not believing his unnerving child was the antichrist we know where he and his wife ended up at huh do you think your kid could be a danger to other kids like the qtips jar could be a coincidence but baby cracked a hard plastic of a big toy baby shattered your tooth although i guess the hard plastic is more worrying you should find that girl you and mr your husband preyed upon and learn what the heck is going on if you felt like the kids scream could stop your heart maybe its because they cannot stop an adults heart yet but another childs just they cracked hard plastic,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCNjluaHBXclQ2ekhEaWJYQVcxc0c3TUFUTHNwNzh5Q3MwNGk2TC1jalh3THFEc3RQWjRzVnY2MEY1SEJJNW1qbDllOW1hWmFPZkM1RmNXMURndlFDcGc9PQ==

banshee maybe but have you also considered that your child may be a siren there are many famous sopranos ariana grande and maria callas come to mind that arewere sirens they had to be trained to lowerslow their songs so that they didnt burst eardrums and glass try recording your childs voice then playing it back slower you might be surprised then all you need is a professional voice trainer or maybe a dolphin translator is the child unusually attracted to water,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCM3pEd3Jma3h5UFZCTGwzem96ckRfMUdYQU84MFNjUl9VX0FEYno4Y3dqdmxKMmZVemFmeDd2ZENvYWtnRkhvdGJVamk1MlB3Q1h0Z3ZLMGZXbzZhTlE9PQ==
well it did cross my mind they say the siren has a very alarming sound but alluring and maybe with training it would be something they could hone in and maybe even become a sought after soprano the recording it and slowing it down i like it i wish id thought of that sooner i might see if it can find an app that could analyze it for frequencies and octaves thanks,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCMHhZUmdGOWUta0F4eGZxWGYzOGxYbVAyd0ppMEs4NUt6U3VwQ2hNVWJmVndmM3lLTmJ5LVNOdXV1RXlnczBTWjhwckt6amVORHdhRHpEUVdtWHhHNVlSS0xJOGxRZDZfaE5RaWZmWjJ4ZlE9

the screams differt in each situation like in the one i described kid had to drink something rule was at least one sip before it could eat a bit drinking was a huge issue with them they disliked everything that was too watery like juice tea water soup or even watermelon lead to a few er visits the kid hated that and would scream because they were frustrated another situation was when the wrong music was playing in their room the kid knew exactly what they liked for some reason one of the nurses who was there at night would change the radio station and kiddo hated it the screams would keep everyone in the neighborhood awake that issue was so so stupid walking in in the morning the wrong music was so obvious kid already stopped screaming when i told them wow i would scream too if i had to listen to that for the whole night didnt stop the nurse from changing the radio station as soon as she walked in during those situations the kid seemed to learn that others hated it if they screamed like that and then started using it in an aggressive way usually while eating dinner it was a group home situation so a few children and teenagers with special needs who needed support to eat the kid im writing about was one of them when they felt they finished dinner they wanted to leave the table immediately that was tricky because we had more people who needed help to eat and we felt it was super unfair to stop someone elses meal because one person decided they finished so the kid had to wait until one of the people working there could take them out to kiddos room they started screaming in such situations after a few days because they knew no one would be able to eat with them screaming so for that child it was some sort of defense first more of a showing something is wrong here but they learned to use it to change the environment to something that fitted their needs and wants better but yes with a proper way to communicate everything would have been easier even with just super basic stuff like do you want a hold out one hand or do you want b hold out the other hand it got so much better,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCQnVseFkxUldQZ0ZzZHYtSUUwUHlDVURpLXN4ZHF6bzJKNnd0eF9sTW5jQ3NiemEtV254NWVwdDMwcURYcWhZNkVlNXFBcnJ3OHZxVjRwSEZDeWYzOGc9PQ==

seeing as how the husband didnt inform her of any reason for not coming back home it seems that he knew an imposter would replace him in the first place possibly the husband is a bud to a lonely and single skinwalker and figured that he can strike a deal with his bud he gets to live with his mistress and his bud is lonely no more adeline the bitch homewrecker then caught wind of this brilliant deal and decided to wreck a home once again since that is what she gets off to,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCUlNaMWdHZFNEYlh2YWpfVXBhREEzazNES1N6MXhUbXlFaE05QzgxeG9Ua3daUjNpSjNJWjBGdW14cnRxQ1pFZEs5SV9pR2t0U0w2ZmVNNHIxOF9pZ1E9PQ==

considering english is not your first language you do have a good understanding and have used the correct wording very well you just need to refine some of the detailing eg i was around <number> to <number> when she was murdered that is a <number> year age range honestly a sibling being murdered would be forever embedded in your memory down to age year month day and even time line so to make it more believable you need to make sure the reader can visualise relate to real life scenarios and believe and be drawn in you have to finesse this kind of information eg the police would never send out a rooky officer and tell you he was nervous you as a child would never be interviewed alone you have given no details of sisters murder where who or how she was found why would the police need extra finger prints of a victims room when they have a body please do not be offended by me pointing out these things but if you are open to honest opinions and tips then i totally believe you have the ability to write well again english not being your first language is impressive as you do write well and english is my first language and my comment will be riddled with errors i am sure and you could put some good stories out for readers as you obviously have a passion for writing the story line could actually be very good as it has a promising base line to create on i wish you all the best,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVMTEZNblRudUkyNUNiRjBnU3MxQ2xqOUlQTHFPdVVJVnRQSFl2ZWV3dmJhcnNVaDFKQTFaT3VXZFlTMTRFVkNuYlNrV3c2QWxJYk5HVkZlT1EwSHE3NWc9PQ==

i looked up that lady you mentioned that did all the movie translations what a badass woman she could have been disappeared if the government caught on much of my family lived in czechoslovakia during those times and still obviously and after communism fell some that had been american went back there czech republic was one of the better off in that situation and they still suffered in many ways it was hard for me to imagine the food situation as i was told about it then i was used to having a million choices and whatever i wanted living in the us they had rations and the rations were whatever the government provided food wise a family member was able to visit once and apparently the whole family there had scrimped for months to save up ration cards so they could provide the american family member a decent meal when they were there i believe they said it was some extra rice and sausage they all came to visit when they were finally free to and i remember their clothes seemed kinda old fashioned and plain to me at least it sounds like yall had plenty of alcohol so fun could still be had i would love to visit my family in the czech republic i wonder what ancient monsters reside in the country there im not good at languages and my closer family that could speak czech in usa are mostly dead now my father could understand czech as a child because his whole family spoke it but he never spoke it my moms family could speak the language in fact her grandmother refused to speak english to them but my grandfather was too busy to teach his kids and grandkids though he spoke it to his death that seems like such a waste to me to not teach the kids the language i know many europeans speak english but id be embarrassed to go somewhere and not grasp any of the language,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVWbFdwak1fVERrd0cxZVh3WlktSEJZNzhKS2hodWdBWW4zYjVIeWhjcmVsVUhqbnZ3LURiNVZyTTRIN3AyNmZQYnhNLVZBb2RHX3pnb3V1UWstV1JRaFE9PQ==

yeah i would try to take the realtor aside before the sale and say that you believe there is something dangerous in the woods and does he know the history of the church historylegends of the native people of the area hint that you saw something and the jig is up you can still go through with the sale if he knows of any priests shamans or others who can tackle this sort of thing he definitely knows his modern history but it sounds like there is something old there hopefully its not an every night thing and its a onceinawhile thing you can prepare for but it may not be a good idea to have a boys lodging home by the haunted church foundation that you now know is for boysacrificing,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVZbkZvMlRfY2NuM1VmNEwzcGFyVFRHMHFxUUp6YXpfaHlTdjdheENySkozZGJ4bDZLOGhsLXppX1p3UFhwTDVTcTZSaElBbjM4TDdvSENmZkZscEZQN0E9PQ==

this sounds more like spirits being forced to relive part of their lives possibly the final moments especially in the case of the boy you couldnt interact with anything which is probably for the best or you might not be sharing this story with us it may also mean that theres not as much to worry about as you originally thought however even if these spirits cantwont cause harm to any of the boys who end up at this house that doesnt mean the boys cant dig something up there could be things buried or hidden in the remains of that church waiting for someone stupid or malicious enough to open the door for them my advice would be to talk to the realtor and see if they know anything tell them you saw spirits in the church he said was destroyed he may be able to point you in the right direction to get things resolved since he knows so many locals and presumably the local folklore too if he cantwont help you and you cant find someone that can get rid of the spirits your boss may need to implement a list of rules the boys need to follow if they stay at the house which hopefully wont lead to a new post here in a year or two i just got taken off the streets by a local nonprofit the house they put me in has a list of rules and i should have followed them,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmem5MVXlOWjRESnQ0REZldWNzTV96S191SkkxdXJUVVU0ZkhHTDVTSDYtZVVOVkg3cG9nQlJjWDd2NWFwS2hWLWFURUxjS0pDUk5oeTZVWC04Qkl5YlE9PQ==

yes but the human mind goes funny in much less time than that lack of human interaction for just a few days produces measurable decreases in language processing skills and for extended periods the psyche breaks down there are awful stories in history of people kept locked up in isolation for decades and they all became at best supremely mentally unstable incapable of prolonged logical thought reading a book and understanding it would be impossible you have someone wander a dark labyrinth for centuries or millennia and youll end up with someone who has forgotten how to read cannot communicate and is little more than a machine driven by their basest instincts and thats assuming they even last that long its for the cruel and the malicious after all if they met another person theres a much higherthanaverage chance that it would end in the death of one or both and the story makes it clear that you absolutely can die there unless the god from the machine decided to reverse it later time is not the limiting factor the fragility and perishability of the human mental condition is,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnN1dxbm8tV0VKcm1NNjAyVjZkalVsWGpjTFh4bnhoMTZXSldZQkdPWEdWcnhPajlQX21CVXRnM25qSmZ1QkNIVTRwNzh1dGVYNzFsOEJMWDJVU1p2RWc9PQ==

he claimed to have built the place and he was able to resurrect the dead since this story is somewhat biblical it seems he was god in abrahamic traditions god created hell in order to punish people and only god was able to resurrect people like the story of jesus and lazarus but this is clearly not exactly the god described in the bible that god states clearly that anyone who sees him directly would die our main character sees him and lives although there is clear damagewhether this is from seeing god or from all the other stuff is impossible to know god in the bible also states that he is omnipotent and yet the god in this story is unable to restore the broken minds of the team and unable to stop them entering except by leaving vague clues so it seems that the main character met god but our ideas of god are incorrect possibly distorted over time and through ignorance maybe hes one of many such gods each overseeing a different part of hell and other such places he certainly seems more like some eldritch horror than anything else to have created such a place at all and then abandoned it so indifferently to the souls who remain inside god does appear as an elderly man in robes which is in keeping with common christian depictions and in a perversion of the multiple stories of jesus healing the blind and restoring their sight this god takes away someones eyes entirely as punishment for being unable to endure a terror beyond humans ability to endure im pretty sure the architect was god but god kind of sucks and is part of a system that we know very little about and are better off staying far away from,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVncWVYMHpfeEhuenBOUFl3QUpqUlp6alBodDl3Mzhhc2k4ZzV0REhLbnh2Y2xGV2xqTDJ6RGhTTU1JV2RjN2tGblJ3bi1Kd1lvWXlIUGVHNzktMUlvdHc9PQ==

yeah the knife and pepper spray were really more to give myself some peace of mind and to just have something to defend myself with if i had to although i was thinking more along the lines of using it to god forbid defend against another person like i said i doubt theyd do me any good against a large animal i probably should have got some bear spray instead especially since i just heard recent reports of bears in nh going up to campsites looking for food and not really fearing people there actually was a fireplace poker there to use for the fire which i did but i was considering using it as a weapon if i needed to i didnt keep it though since it wasnt mine,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwdFZ5aDFIUDlJdkVTN0lISUZoY2lYbnFEQmhJZV9IMjh0YkZ4MnVkU3ZZV0IwM1B2aW9KMXFUY3JIWE1WWFdPb3Vjb1hEdnVNakRQRktuQWFfSjBVYmc9PQ==

i wonder if theres others like him i used to go to a local pub in my old town that had a specific waitress who never actually seemed to be serving anyone if a customer seemed to need help they wouldnt call to her they would call to other servers as if she wasnt there she would never stop to take orders or even give a refill shed just be cleaning or doing anything else that didnt require customer interaction never heard her speak but once i did see her stop at a table with just one lone young woman sitting there and offer to refill her soda perfectly normal voice nothing weird woman thanked her waitress took the empty glass and went to the back came back again with a full glass nothing odd about it two days later i went there and found cop cars everywhere place was under investigation closing down from the look of it they waved me off when i tried to ask questions from my car but i managed to gather that a local woman had recently gone missing last seen at the pub two days ago i didnt hear a description dont know if it was the same woman the pub didnt close after all but i stayed away hey maybe the waitress was the weirdo mans offspring like father like daughter you cant call the game it goes on forever your best bet is to just leave the bleachers and walk away,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwSjZHOHNVQnQ0elgwVGJEWEpBR2ZCa2d5TnU1ZWlaU0phSWZvYTFoQWVoMDR0b20yZ3l3UEdTZzJXbWR6M3FHSFhPUHNhMFkweEtrWkFXZHFvRmg5d0E9PQ==

continued caelan caelan where are you its really nice out here tonight come a little further zack a female voice called to my left you cant save him zack you couldnt even save me a more distorted voice called to my left bring me my goddamn dog back it should have been my son an even more distorted voice snarled i couldnt tell where that voice came from this voice was more menacing and echoed even deeper into the waves when the voices ceased something snarled from beneath the water followed by highpitched muffled screams i forced myself down under my eyes didnt adjust to the darkness but there was just enough light to see black sludge permeating the water above and below methe sludge stung my eyes i closed them and forced myself further below the highpitched scream grew more audible my eyes opened in front of caelan who slipped in and out of consciousness as the sludge permeated his body i couldnt see beneath the sludge but i reached out to grab caelan from the rubbery and scaly entity constricting his body surprisingly his body slipped from the entity and i pulled him above the surface he opened his eyes and we both were coughing profusely caelean forced himself out of my arms and hiccupped a mouth full of water are you okay caelan you shouldnt have done that caelan yelled his eyes morphed from blue to a darker shade you were drowning you can try all you want but itll always be the same whatwhat do you mean we have to get back before i could say anything more i heard another snarl from beneath the water the rubbery and scaly entity emerged from the water taking the form of an enormous twisting black tail the tail swept over the waves colliding with my body its ivory scales puncturing my chest my body propelled backward dangling helplessly as it skirted over the now still rapids the speed felt like being on an upside down roller coaster without any straps or supports i couldnt scream i couldnt move as my body blew backward over the shore and onto the grassy knoll upon my bodys impact i slipped into darkness when i awoke from my trancelike state the sun beamed through my eyes for some reason i felt stiff without any excruciating pain my arms and legs moved without peril i rose to my feet and touched my chest surprised to see my shirt back on and my cell phone in my pocket had i dreamt the night before at that moment darius power of suggestion and hallucination explanation seemed more logical even though i couldnt quite make sense of it if a giant serpent actually attacked me and my body impacted the knoll at roller coaster speed i would have been killed upon impact i also hadnt slept well the previous night and probably collapsed upon the knoll dreaming up my nightmarish encounter with caelan and the serpent it was all beginning to make sense or at least i thought it did the three of us came to the river with our deeply buried trauma and after hearing the story of the river serpent we saw and heard what we wanted to people hallucinated ghosts and demons for all sorts of strange reasons i couldnt explain the psychology behind it but figured this was the most satisfying explanation for the previous days events when i checked my phone i found a number of missing calls from jordan with all the chaos from the previous day i almost forgot he was my roommate i texted the guys that i was okay and that i accidentally fell asleep in the park as i finished the texts i looked up to see matty knee deep in the morning tide i rubbed my eyes to make sure i wasnt hallucinating again matty i shouted with glee youre a sight for sore eyes what are you doing out here i expected to hear mattys gleeful voice but upon reaching him he responded with a sense of sorrow i came out here hoping to see my poor macmin or nighean the serpent only lets you see what he wants i didnt realize both of them died matty im so sorry he sighed caelan drowned looking for the serpent irene passed shortly afterprobably of a broken heart my heart was exploding in my chest my entire body felt nauseous i excused myself and rushed up the knoll and projectile vomited black sludge onto the grass another scale floated upward like a submerged shark fin after my body felt empty and lifeless i blinked and there was nothing there but tall grass and in the distance the sound of the cruel morning waves,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUxN0FIdGRZQnRocUlYczc1bC1hajVJNXFqRVI3RWxZRkN2REx1QnVESDBpa3htV2ptbFJ3M0UyVVJOR1hxZmxuRXdxNzlvam1OcVV4NUdBdzI2R25SNXc9PQ==

i think they came in through the window which was why the screen and the window were open the reason they were all the way at the end of the hall and the reason op said they hear the windows rattling from the outside at the end of the story,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5VkFMRU9JVmdJNHBYc3piUmFGVGdKWGdkQmZDTkU2MzlGRXF2MUU0NUNnSDdWTmFvSTdRNkZ6X3REMGVyaTd3d2FMSGQwNnFWTDFpandEbEEyOTFjVXc9PQ==

maybe but they say they make sure to lock all of the windows before it gets dark and that they hear rattling coming from the outside at the end which lead me to believe op thought they came in through the window they also just said the cno told them a draw was needed that doesnt necessarily mean they checked them in when they made a point to mention the details about it being on the camera when op went into the room and came out i was thinking they might say something about the patient and his dad never showing up on camera but they never explained that part so who knows,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5amFjRXZCUEtmSTVnT0lFNFdMNWNvelBoR0JzdzIxUlFyeHllWnIzTDJqOW1XSXp5MFc0M1BQbmRYNFFnZFpNVFhGWDVrSzVnUzFZV1NycFowQ2l3bFE9PQ==

bro this might just sound as insane as what youre experiencing but i think that being thats haunting you might be a fetch fetches are basically doppelgangers that try to replace you they start out with little things like your keychain or your airpods as they grow stronger the objects they duplicate become bigger and they might even start to impersonate humans the fact that you saw your roommates fetch means that its already pretty strong if it continues to get more powerful it will start erasing you slowly starting with your memories thats why you need to write everything down im glad you already left your apartment dont go back there its to dangerous your roommate is probably lost at this point if he wasnt gone already dont go back to your routines switch locations randomly always keep something made of iron with you preferably a knife it might buy you some valuable time if you have to face the fetch most importantly you should look up people that might be able to help you i wish you the best of luck,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHZWRUbW9SM3drYnJYLXdKaFc3U2JsUUZBQzZlaWswZ0I0eC1aVG5qaW9OSGhlLXFuNHVPdjRyZlg0Qm16Wk9SZzJwc1BMcDZieTZNNm1zbGd3OVJqT3c9PQ==

im curious about how heavy that sword is i do historical reenactment and mines only a classc so useable on the battlefield but not the best quality that thing is darn heavy and not got the best balance but it does the job for me atm ive been working at a bar and grill in the netherlands there are some rules here that we need to follow and i might even have to use my sword sometime to protect someone if things get any worse here if you know what i mean i however have an allergy to iron so i need to use gloves a lot even when working the grill or the smoker i get blisters on my hands im curious how lolo was able to check that it was undamaged especially since he is inhuman how did he pick it up edit to add my allergy also extends to steel too but not as bad i get little itchy bumps on my hands if i touch steel but pure iron burns and blisters,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIMXVRdmFhVmxyLWk4VlVDaVR6VE9aUlRuemxXN1dya21VUFhRLVF5bkJ3S3NIcXlfRFRRdllZcEtveWdpcnRLS01VR2VnR1pTckNYTHhWOVRoMnV0ZlE9PQ==

thankfully using that iron poker made me somewhat used to flailing heavy things around theres definitely a huge difference between the two that sword has some weight to it he only touched the hilt not the blade ive hit him with iron before and it gave him a rash so fingers crossed that being in proximity to it gave him another allergic reaction maybe ill get lucky and itll be anaphylaxis this time,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIMW5vYXRhaTlZUGJWWHcweWlDRXdCSk5NaW1BLWdvSnVzbnUzVVl3aXlJN1pNQW94S0V0ZXAyMEVtM0lEQUxnOHJzTFlLQnZyWUR0bTVqSXZidUw5N18zV3BXYlFaeHBqa2lpYWwwUXhKVFk9
thats what im thinking he meant some of the heroes of legend like achilles beowulf fionn man cumhaill etc are extremely difficult to kill which is ironic considering that most of them die young and capable of facing off against pests that most humans would never survive against,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIVkpiVXJ0dTdYbkN1bzZzcEU4d1NjWVRSWEZFZXFtU3FVYVVKOHhkZVRIVGMxSW51dGxpbEE2T0d3eTdfZTl0ZXJaaDJwYjJoa2paNjlUUzY4YkR4RXFJeVdpeTFCQy1xUmZZekxwNzNieTg9
yeah he seems like a total ass looks like he has a similar allergy to me then i need gloves with my steel sword it would be silly not to with how these men fight in reenactment let alone the blistering and allergies from them the hilt itself from mine is pure steel so if my wrist touches it i break out itch for a few days then im ok iron though its like ive touched a hot pan that ive left the handle on the fire for too long wielding a sword takes some skill also muscles if youre not used to it my preferred weapon is the <number>handed spear which consequently mine is made of wrought iron so a nice ash shaft with a lot of training i can wield it nicely and even shorten it for close combat it also helps for leg swiping too it really comes in handy if you have an inhuman barge into your home it happens to me more than i would like to be fair but meh shit happensperhaps ill post my tales of woes and events at some point also look into smoked salt and garlic its been a game changer for me,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIaDN0YUhBUlVzd1BxUXhteWFlQkgxZWd6ZDR0VUlkNEtkZmFWOTRfUTdQa2o5NEI4SG9JMVVTTVN6MFVLRHdmZndENWZvN3ZLWTJkSkdkTmVfM2VEX2c9PQ==

please do post your tales actually i relate to the atypical inserting themselves into my life especially my home and yeah its definitely not like in the movies where the main character picks up a sword and they just know granted i didnt think it would be im realistic when it comes to this stuff its just when some asshole wild huntsman essentially thrusts one into your hands and gleefully holds your freedom over your head you kind of begin to resent all the childhood stories of the heroes just magically being able to slay the dragon first try you know,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIMDVuS3JUVmUyYWxrZ2M2NUZVVmxsT2lldGJsNkdoUkEwdDZFTzNpN2h1WW9MUG1pRHNoZmhtaWx5WThheDdrZ1h3ZmxsOGJ0dWxUWHhZMVBFUE5jRTZQdXpYT1hqcUM2WDZwdUV0ank5Y3c9

i dont know your baby was replaced by a demon but i also dont know about jumping to a postpartum psychosis diagnosis either maybe the freckle was actually something else like a speck of dried fluid you could also have had a terrible nightmare due to the stress of all the changes around do you have any bruising or scabbing around your nipple that was bitten have a doc evaluate the wound take advantage of being at the hospital and speak with the psychologist about postpartum psychosis and the symptoms if you feel like youre truly not having a mental health crisis it also wouldnt hurt to have labs drawn incase youre being drugged treat the baby kindly no matter what you think it is best case scenario is that this is your baby do you know who the donor was theres a chance your baby could have some uniqueparentage thats making her change physical features then again if it is a changeling treating it badly may put your own baby at risk you can look up info on changelings and see if you are able to trade the fae back for your baby i dont know what to think of your wife but she sounds controlling there could be a connection there too so play it safe when you get home i dont like how quick she was to have you committed its best to be safe with ppp ppd but at the same time i feel like there could have been a step in between this,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIMXVhZ2x0VjYyNUU0ZGxfYlo5TjJHWjIwMi12dGNzWmxXMU9ENkNQNVN1ZXNHT1k1TTVZckJJTHVPODBudmE5Znd5VURveVpvZVhDZ1VRQzN4RHh4eWNhUG00WTV6aEh0NVpSX0ZXbTkyY1E9

i actually must concur i know she seems to have an well atypical nature and its more than understandable that the things youve seen and been through with her would leave you doing a bit of a doubletake or moreso and some nervousness of what she might be capable of but really i think if she was planning to cause you any real harm then shes had plenty of ample time and opportunity to do so already yet she hasnt seemed to capitalize on it thus i would would wager that shes probably on the upandup with what she says hopefully considering the majority of folks experiences with the supernatural on this site tend to turn out much more straightforwardsly frightening and lethal and a lot of them dont get the opportunity to make followup posts like you now have id wager youre probably better off trying to accept and get used to her im not entirely sure that what she feels for you can be classified as traditional love as most people know it but it seems to be close enough that you can probably enjoy a pretty good and fulfilling existence with her for the most part so long as you can get used to her and dont try to rock the boat toomuch,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZJZ0djUWJzWUJTMURKOHRrZFM2M0pFMmlYVnFUd2daZVB4Z3E5RTJRa19BM0J5UFlXbGY3b2luWVJfYW5DMkpFV0pVYnhsb2w4MU9wdkxJdVZCOExpb3c9PQ==

hi a simple solution to this would be as follows unless theres some information out there that says otherwise it seems that two conditions have to be met to see the woman <number> it has to be through glass <number> you have to see her with your eyes the person that died on the fourth day by seeing her may have been pure coincidence unless theres been multiple occurrences with people dying on that day the best bet of surviving is blindfolding yourself and reaching authorities or a hospital for help the blindfold will stop you from seeing her through windows and glass but if that doesnt help and she inevitably kills you regardless of whether you see her in the glass or not try everything you can to record the encounter and fight back maybe one thing will work and help the next person searching for answers good luck edit maybe not recording but im sure as long as youre blindfolded and dont look through the lens of the camera youll have a chance or record audio,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZST3hmNml2OVJpYWRLQlJKRkdTSDF2V3RRZG12WkRnTlZUM3R4NTBMcnB0NjlqZFBxV1g1QlFDU2VmcFRUNnlzUDg5cE5pbkpLSnZwYzMxbFhYMzd1S1E9PQ==

hi mental health professional here i want to address the comments regarding mental health and medication i saw the theory that this person could be experiencing psychosis but the writing is easily followed there is some tangential thinking but brought back on track easily thats not to say that these arent hallucinations you can have hallucinations and not be in psychosis for anyone experiencing symptoms its recommended to get a full physical health work up and then see a therapist our bodies are complicated and sometimes our physical health messes with our mental health or vice versa this is not medical advise and is based on years of professional experience please dont recommend people get on medication when youre not their provider hope this provides some insight op i hope youre doing okay it doesnt matter if no one else thinks this is real what matters is that its real to you and causing real psychological pain it may be worth learning realitychecking techniques type of coping skills to help you find what can be seen by others and whats seen by just you listen to your body reach out to people you trust,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZSTURaMkZ4MUVPVGJrTlotYzhlQVhTb0JpcGROX3JFVVRsdHFEMmthUXl1WDFNdmtESEJnMWdxMkVJQkUtdkE1OFFVVGlCc1F1RnMwUTZwMXExOEQyM0E9PQ==

is it bad that this whole time i kept thinking these people shouldnt have pets you shouldnt feed a snake live prey and theyre kinda stupid enough that you shouldnt have to if they dont get the mouserat right away theres a good chance it will come back and try to fight it then you have an injured maybe even killed snake on your hands and rats are social and smart they need companionship and enrichment and it sounds like they arent keeping its cage clean enough too bad even if you bring it up they probably wont care snakes are exotic and too many people get them without reading up on care first and rats are a throwaway pet great story op though i cant wait for the next part,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTOUU3OEFIMEpKZnNkby1vLURPQ0JDQVlaWDg2NGtneFhCQTNxWi1ZN3ZDWnphRnFXMmk5NVpaMkJ6cWowOW9RYXBJdXlQamNYd1FfZE5sVm1pYjkyb3c9PQ==

people who have a strong connection sometimes all die in short timespan we can see that at old people in relationship more often i can imagine that these deaths reason could be simply not being fokused enough because of thinking of someones death my advice for you is stay fokused on what you do and watch your surrounding area remember those who are gone while you relax when you think about daemons they will hunt you this leads to distraction and maybe this causes your death by accident so dont think about such stuff im sorry for your loss,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZjcGgzY3JFeldnbkRIcHhkeVpiZGVxWGNfWm8tcW5uU1pkYVNBcHZicTU3cUI1OEQ1SDZITFREUnpiZWhTTGdwblhEbGs4ZEJCc0Exa3Z5cnRxRFN6V3c9PQ==

i mean the one major issue with your story is that any reasonable person would be calling the police if they heard that much screaming and breaking furniture i do suppose some people let their neighbors murder each other and thats how it makes the headlines but usually the cops are called in such circumstances frankly until you got to the hoodoo that was the biggest piece that was unbelievable fr though i suppose it could make a goose bumps ,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZpSVpqZkhaWVRuUjMxQm9KZVFwQmJTLWhQX0FwQVpHVGNHX3BoeFNXdUNWaWkySjlmRU5zdk5ORXctQ1M0c1dPZWJKeVJ5eVVmMjgyQ3E0eF94eTFjQnc9PQ==

i wouldnt be so hasty to kill toby or firstprimetoby as the case might be like some of the other commenters seem to be advocating i mean dont get me wrong this is all his fault in a technical manner but the way that your family was treating him makes me think that hes being manipulated by these copyentities moreso than being the one doing any of the manipulating if you absolutely need vengeance then you can take it later after youve gotten your family back or at least exhausted every other available option plus while they might be vicious and dangerous they do have a point that theres no <number> guarantee that killing him would actually remove the copytobys from your family toby says that this all started due to astral projection im no expert on the subject myself but i do know that there are experts that exist out there psychics and mystics and the like maybe you could seek out someone knowledgeable on the topic and ask them if they have any idea how to properly exorcise astral entities its worth a shot now that you at least have the knowledge that such being beings seem to be what youre dealing with,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZpTkwteDU0bUVsSG1ERmo5clp4MDlCaWRIWm0tWFdZaklxeVpDbm1sbGtCSEwyMDdONXRXTkxFWmNrazlMTl9aMFNuSU1hUWVJb05HSWQ0TUVjamN4ZkE9PQ==

snapping turtles thats what the creature reminds me of to feed they open their mouth and wiggle their worm like tongue to lure in fish only instead of getting a meal they become the meal themselves sounds like the creature was doing the same thing only letting itself get its tongue attacked to draw more predators in before feeding though i find it strange the lure is humanoid in shape other ocean predators dont prey on humans like fish do worms and while it could lure in humans as well there is no way itd draw enough to be considered a main food source,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZtcTVsM0Y1bll4em9QUjVDREpMeXZ6OGhLTkpOSE9rcHAzV29LeGtsbjRfbkViMjdFUWFYanBzY3l1M1B0R1dxY05ZNGFqRVZjSENqRmltbWJxV2tpNUE9PQ==

so a kickapoo tribesman and youre aunt followed by a fox an owl and a giant hound for lack of a better term as well as what appears to be a bone from a rabbit only two of these are dream manifestations the rest are realworld signs if that makes sense the meaning of the animals as well as the order they appear probably have different meanings to different natives and may even be open to interpretation with the animals representing keywords that are of value just guessing here but you are being encouraged to embrace your heritage the fox usually represents cunning and intellect the owl depicts wisdom and the hound either looking for its pack or lost and trying to find its way home as a reminder i am a westerner and know little of your culture i am simply offering an opinion that may or may not be assistance best of luck on your journey,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZtb1pZUXBBNnM2aFNDclpWY3N0OWJnZmJjNVpjZUVld0VzWGFmUmY3LXZDYVhZaW9yTWtQU0k1bEI4bVpvQ1VLay1DbWZFUjlEM3lQNHBCR1BTakxPWkE9PQ==
well im not very familiar with the astral projection but i think i may have some ideas as to how to fix things and bring your family back <number> eliminate toby in truth i kinda feel bad for the guy and id rather he didnt die sadly this may be the only way it would make sense that these copies which control your family would also die since they should be connected <number> negotiate with the copies this might sound a little crazy but hear me out from what you said so far i dont have the impressions that thee copies are evil just desperate i think they could be reasoned with first of all clearly they dont like taking over people your sister tried to not take over your mother until she couldnt hide anymore your mom then did the same thing with your dad initially tried to avoid the topic by offering sex but when that didnt work she took over him so it seems its not their wish to take control over people they are just desperate second these copies are technically toby this means that these copies may also love you as well it sounds weird but hear me out first we know toby has feeling for you so these copies may harbor some form of feelings for you as well your mom said they didnt take over your body to keep toby from ending himself but what stopped them from taking over you the fake you could have simply pretended to be the real you to toby and thats it maybe they didnt want to take the risk or maybe they didnt do it because they care for you but then why did they threaten you well as i said they are afraid so they will do what them deem necessary one thing is to threaten and another to actually do it when they came that night to your room i believe they did it to put the fear of god in you similar with harming you now in front of toby and even if im wrong they cant get rid of you because you are their trump card if they do then there is nothing stopping toby from ending himself so maybe there is a way for you to negotiate with them and find a way for them to be happy and your family to be brought back you could ask them what exactly happened to your parents and sister granted they could lie here and say that their dead so you would lose hope and abandon any change at getting them back when in reality your family are either stuck in their own bodies unable to take control or they are now in the astral projection with no way to return to their bodies the downside is that i dont see much way for you to agree on you want your family back as we do while the copies want to remain so there doesnt seem to be a way for you to make a deal anyone will be happy with <number> enter the astral projection yourself this might be a bit to fantasy or wishful thinking but it is also the best outcome in my opinion if you and toby enter together then you could find the copies and fight them and maybe end them without harming your family bodies moreover there is a change you will also find your familys souls here hence the <number> of you cand defeat the three copies personally i would try option <number> first and then <number> taking option <number> first may allow you to learn more about these copies and potential weaknesses in this way you could better prepare for option <number> if it will be needed and i suspect it will some people suggested that you seek help from someone else but i disagree while i did say that the copies dont seem to like taking over people they will do it if necessary if you bring another person then said person will be controlled and you will have to deal with more then <number> copies i hope this helps and you will manage to bring your family back,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZtZXFrTVAzSXYtWUZxZ1NBY2FLMDZGZkJuaEg3S3g0NndKRjdCNmZHRE9Wdlc1T0ZtSG0yTHRwS3J0NzVpY0JvSDVZV1ZfY1h6c29WZDEzRUI2TndGdGc9PQ==

got ai to write one about my husband and i title the house on willow lane tom and i have been married for seven years and weve known each other for fifteen our life together has been comfortable predictable even in all the best ways tom has always been devoted to me and while hes not the type to finish projects around the house ive always appreciated his unwavering love ive often joked that he couldnt be more perfect even with his little quirks we recently moved into an old house on willow lane it was the kind of place that people either fall in love with or find unsettling i was in the former category charmed by its creaky floors and ivycovered walls tom on the other hand seemed hesitant he never said anything outright but i could tell he was uneasy especially about the attic the attic had been locked when we bought the house with the previous owner simply saying its best left alone but i was curious i imagined it full of forgotten treasures dusty antiques and old family heirlooms tom though seemed to have an unspoken aversion to it hed always change the subject when i brought it up one night after tom had gone to bed i decided to explore the attic on my own i found the key hidden in a drawer in the studya large oldfashioned thing heavy in my hand the door creaked ominously as i unlocked it and a chill ran down my spine as i pushed it open the attic was surprisingly bare with just a few pieces of old furniture covered in white sheets the air was thick with dust and the single bulb hanging from the ceiling cast long eerie shadows on the walls i was about to turn back when i noticed something strangea small door in the far corner barely noticeable in the dim light curiosity got the better of me and i made my way over my footsteps echoing in the empty space the door was tiny almost childsized with no handle or lock i hesitated for a moment then pushed it open with a creak inside was a small dark room the only thing in it was a mirror an old ornate thing with a heavy wooden frame it seemed out of place almost too grand for such a small hidden room as i approached i saw my reflection but there was something off about it the image was distorted as if the glass were warped i reached out to touch the mirror and as my fingers brushed the cold surface i heard a voice behind metoms voice meghan what are you doing up here i spun around my heart leaping into my throat tom was standing in the doorway his face pale and drawn ii wanted to see the attic i stammered trying to steady my breathing his eyes flicked to the mirror and a strange expression crossed his facefear anger and something else i couldnt quite place you shouldnt be here he said quietly its not safe what do you mean i asked confused its just an old mirror tom shook his head his eyes never leaving the mirror we need to go downstairs now he took my hand and led me out of the attic closing the door firmly behind us that night i couldnt shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong tom wouldnt talk about what had happened but i could see the fear in his eyes the way he avoided the subject over the next few days tom grew increasingly distant he was always distracted his mind elsewhere hed wake up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat his eyes wild and unfocused id try to comfort him but hed just shake his head telling me everything was fine then one night i woke up to find tom wasnt beside me the house was silent the kind of silence that presses in on you heavy and oppressive i called his name but there was no answer panic gripped me as i searched the house finally i made my way to the attic dreading what i might find the door was ajar and i could see a faint light coming from inside i found tom standing in front of the mirror staring into it with a look of utter terror on his face tom i whispered my voice shaking he didnt respond his reflection in the mirror was differentdarker twisted it was smiling a cold cruel smile that didnt belong to my tom i stepped closer and thats when i saw itthe reflection wasnt just different it was moving on its own i screamed grabbing tom and pulling him away from the mirror the image in the glass seemed to ripple as if something was trying to push through meghan we have to leave tom gasped his voice hoarse its not safe here the mirror its trying to take me we fled the house that night leaving everything behind tom was never the same after that he was quieter more withdrawn and no matter how much i asked he refused to talk about what hed seen in the mirror ive often wondered what would have happened if i hadnt found him in time if that twisted reflection had succeeded in taking him but deep down i know one thing for certain the house on willow lane wasnt just old it was hungry and it almost took the one person i loved most,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ1a3RpVC1aVld1LTZQMExNanl1Ym1GU1JvUEVQcDJnVUhCRGgtSXp4RmsxdmhsTWw5dW1FSU9tRjU3NTR3U2duYV9Kak9CUkRfdE9SMnF5QkRQTFkwSE05cEtabmUwWGhNZzdNSEptazNDQTA9

hi regarding your tinnitus for years i also had it aand ended up seeing a traditional chinese medicine practitioner i discovered that my tinnitus was actually caused by blocked eustachian tubesbasically nasal drainage tubes running down the back of your neck when your tinnitus is present push your head as far back as you can if the levelvolume momentarily increases or decreases it probably means blocked tubes also if you push with your fingers on the back of your neck on either side of the spine and feel mild pain then thats another indicator finally if you breathe int through your nose forcefully like your clearing it a couple of times and the volume decreases for awhile then youre in luck hot showers focusing the water on the back of your neck while massaging it can help also eucalyptus and other nasal clearing medicines best to see your doctor though and get their advice on cleaning your eustachian tubes hope this helps somebody alot of people have this and have no idea that its whats causing their tinnitus and that its an easy fix,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSd1FXYmI3aFM2VWlmQmJnM3o4RUNpUUpRckRzdXZiQzVKeEZ4NjZrWVE5NHFJYk0yVE9fZHVTVDZtSU9XSVBjaWwwMUFDWFYtLWcxRW1Ibnc1VzJwc3RkQnlkSGlDN3diMkY5YlJHNmRqUFk9

ive been thinking about the life debt thing what are the terms exactly iirc without back pedaling he saved you from the white stag and thus has a claim to your life right and has decided that his payment will be adding you to the wild hunt solid repipe so the terms are clearly stated you cant offer up something else to appease him because he wants you so how do you give up yourself without actually giving up yourself off the top of my head i can think of a couple semi plausible scenarios the first and least likely would be to savespare his life in return which would in theory cancel out the debt the devil is in the details here and while this one is definitely <number><number> on the difficulty scale an opportunity may present itself keep it in mind as a hail mary to maybe build off the second and more murky would be to somehow make someone or something else you how youd go about this i would really have to do a deep dive into but i cant imagine any way to do it that wouldnt condemn someone to the same fate youre facing maybe find a child predator in prison and convince them trading identities could commute their sentence im just spitballing here this could solve your immediate problem but would absolutely piss off the mechanic and co ill keep researching based on your writing i have an idea of their origin but anything you could narrow down would help,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdoeGZRcGVJclc5MTJxYlE5VXdYdzcyb2Y2dUMxTkJxUTh2WG5kOGIyTllhNkJ0c3Q0aTJqOHFkSDM0TnpkNlQ3NnpPMk1xTWV1ZVd2a2lzZWtfQi1hQlE9PQ==

you shouldnt be alone with this especially today you need a hug or a hand to hold you should go see sams parents today they probably also wonder if it was their fault if they could have somehow discouraged her reckless streak in childhood so this never happened all of your minds are going to be in the same place and they could probably use a hug too it wasnt your fault or theirs someone as smart as sam should have seen that it was a bad idea to behave so recklessly <number> days out of the year by the time we make it to college we are all aware that there are things worse than death and that many of them are caused by reckless behavior the only one responsible for what happened is sam and its okay to say that and have feelings about it it doesnt make you a bad person or change how much you love her and i think sam would probably feel better if she knew that the people who most loved her were mourning her together and helping each other through it go see her parents,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PUjNzRVkxQUdibnoxRjQ2bC1KbWduc3BjWHBLcm0zN1R4NXRtcTRGZVFNZWFhREo4bkZLQnFwaWV4T0xEa0NVcDhhQTR1SlJXLXg3XzlyMXMtWklWX2c9PQ==

i was in aokigahara this past june i took a <number> mile hike starting at the ice cave and going counterclockwise in a rough circle im an experienced hiker had a trail planned and was using a good gps it should have taken roughly <number>h max i started around noon and the first two hours were beautiful the trail was a bit overgrown occasionally little more than a deer path but was easy to follow there was the occasional ambush from a joro spider to spook me but that was offset by hundreds of butterflies countless birds and a few badgers i was happy peaceful and enjoying the day in the third hour the trail veered off sharply and got sparse there were pink ribbons around trees marking the path but they started getting more spread out and the woods got more dense the ground was craggy with an abundance of small rootbound mossy caves more like holes really and was increasingly difficult to traverse then the path was gone i was traveling ribbon to ribbon always keeping the next in sight my foot slipped and i took a minute to sit when i stood back up there was no ribbon and no trail i could see the tree where im certain the ribbon was and could see my path through the brush back to where im certain the last marker had been there were no ribbons to be found i checked my garmin gps it showed my dot on the map and the blue line than followed by path both ended where i veered into the woods i checked my compass and used it to backtrack used chalk to mark trees my compass led me in circles checked my phone no signal i was deeply deeply lost i checked the time i had been lost for over two hours it didnt feel like it had been that long the strangest part is that the birdsong was gone admittedly that was likely because i was crashing through the underbrush it was still eerie to have the forest be totality silent the sun was starting to set so i kept it at my back and walked what i hoped was generally east two more hours i walked it was pushing twilight and i didnt bring a headlamp i was fighting panic fearing i would be lost in the dark with no way to call for help just as the night fell i stumbled on a deer trail literally stumbled i tripped scraped my hand on the ground and looked up to find it right in front of me i set myself on it and it widened eventually it met up with a large road the path from the wind cave to the ice cave across the junction was a chain and a giant sign saying danger do not enter in english and japanese warning against the trail i had just come from thats when i noticed that the birds were singing again i checked my gps my dot was there and the blue line picked up where id found the trail i had phone signal i had missed the last bus so i had to call for a taxi to get me back to my ryoken i had lost almost <number> hours on a stretch of woods that should have taken less than min to cross ive never experienced anything like it i fell out of the world that day and whatever old things that live in the deeps of aokigahara chose to let me go <url>,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9QLThEeFdnNDg1SXVsamZqdUpaLUh6NUdjclBDODFpS2lmSFQzTWdpNi0xaVRYMjBlTmFLSnZBVGx5a3FTeWdGMjAyQ2kxZjZYZi1tQzYzZ2s5ZDZxLXc9PQ==

you havent actually reached the black chakra as its not a place that can be reached none of the chakras are the places you saw were metaphysical loci for the chakras think of them as tests you go to the locus and if you reach the proper mental state you tap into that locuss corresponding chakra otherwise you fail the test to varying consequences thats why the <number> chakra system is the most commonly practiceed those chakras are safe the black chakra is decidedly not safe it represents the positive side of nihilism nothing you do think possess or achieve will ever matter all that makes you yourself will be forgotten by an uncaring universe thatreduces all to nothing in the wake of its cosmic shrug tapping into the black chakra means accepting this fact but not falling victim to it if nothing has intrinsic value or permanency you can assert for yourself the importance and value of your self your actions and the people and things within your own sphere of experience you can in effect become master of your world and act according to that which brings you happiness contentment and sense of what is right those who have failed in this endeavor fall to the nnegative aspect of this nihilism becoming spiritually dead they lose all sense of hope purpose and self seeking only to fill the bleak void that they have unwittingly imposed upon themselves becoming the husklike entities you saw driven by nothing but the basest instinct to consume as for how these husks may have entered the physical plane i cant really say its entirely possible that they are merely your own traumatic delusions,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9QbGo4YmFiUUJKdy1jS2ZYZUlFSEl5ODNJMnpFLXZaOUFaWjdpM2h1R3RjUkxnZ3hzbG1TWjRwbENQbGw5Z1hYQ2dBZUFtcmRiT3BEWmJEdWxhdllJWUE9PQ==

sometimes our minds fill in the blanks when we experience things that we are unable to make sense of otherwise we are predisposed to patterns and connections perhaps you witnessed his murder when you were a child but your traumatised mind was not able to cope and thats why everything there is so unlived in now the events took place years earlier,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9TckdGYjNyVjBIZUVlaW9tU1lCVFhvSHRkekxicm9hWjhGd3hobmRxUm1Vem9aUkl4OG1Yc2VtT1VYdm1UQ1pvSjlOWHNfRUhfVFFKSmV1bktKQnRSLVE9PQ==

its totally understandable im someone who struggles to move past and heal from things when i still have unanswered questions swirling in my brain too i can only think of two options though <number> this is trauma it happened when you were younger and perhaps was a cult and a murder of a younger friend or sibling that your mind attempted to protect you from you talked about feeling frozen in place that your friend was in a trance people often forget that the fight or flight response isnt a binary its fight flight freeze and fawn its possible both your brains felt freeze held the best prospects for survival if this were the case it would make sense as to why he has no social media presence he didnt make it past child or young adulthood etc alternatively <number> there was something supernatural in play the events were in real time and more recent the aging and change in the house and grounds similar to a glamour to deceive any law enforcement when the occupants realised you had escaped and would likely report them edit if you have any analogue stuff of mark like print or polaroid pictures they might be unaffected by whatever the cult did to erase him from the internet,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9XSGhTSFZDejJSbzB0MWx5bVdBMU95RjJxVzVhZFp0QUpIUmNPV20ySmoyZUlFUVV5b2xxMTY3Sm5TM0dJc0VORUVjNWx5Zl95MzVEaFkxOENTZ3FHTUE9PQ==

soooooooo what are the odds that your new power to control the moving river would extend to dragging grayson into it and riding it straight through grey world into the campground i mean tyler did make the questionable decision to buy that damn lake which means theres a water source on the property and if beau and the lady of stories cant talk andor slap some sense into a fellow inhuman being on ancient land that belongs to someone else and a good distance from his damn gateway should take grayson down a few pegs and buy cassie josh and james time to come up with a plan before you get back to campus might not be a great plan and will likely involve making another deal with a certain trickster who is entirely too fond of suspenders if they can pin him down and far less likely to hitch a ride to the campground with you than he was over summer break but its something,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZT0ZfX0pkRC0tOGRkVDMxNm9VOG5xeGRldFpVQmVsQnhLVEJ3RmVMNENieGhzbHhLZVU1SWJHY3h4NTY5LVBqOTJabTNnUFJ1RHhJcUptQkJsLWpHZHc9PQ==

one of the evidences of alien and ghost encounters is that feeling of dread even when the being is not seen worst casinario it kills you it has happened ask any physicist whos looked at the documentation two best casinarios it never does anything for some arbitrary reason or it starts to talk to you you might hear things you and i thought only schizophrenics heard you know those crazy people who imagine entities telling them theyre jesus and that they need to kill themselves for the sin of the world these things will be persuasive they have been persuasive dont you wonder why people always do the crazy things they say they were told to do by ghosts kill john lennon etc if demons werent persuasive by unimaginable degree they wouldnt have been able to convince the other monstrous angels to betray their own creator humans dont stand a sliver of chance ive only ever heard about people like you its interesting to just randomly find someone like this on reddit theres an obvious solution if you care to solve it most dont youve discovered the being that claims to the western world to be an extra terrestrial and that claimed to the egyptians to be horus to the hindus shiva and others to the native americans skin walkers dont believe the tv that all these are different phenomenon they invented the tv john logie baird who first pioneered tv got the idea from a seance where he believes he met thomas edisons ghost or maybe youre just paranoid its a possibility as for the solution to all possibilities utter submission to the creator youve been avoiding your whole life but just dont realize it when people hear this they think temporary submission just to get what i want out of god dont be a fool like the rest,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZNHdXRDdSWHdINGpXS2NfSEFJUXZkOE8ybkc0dWZIb3V4N1NNd21fTlZpOHV0R3dnelFYaEdyZE5SNF9kc2pzSU1tYnVDbE1kN1hHSWZoZDEzdGtXREdtVlhRV3pyZDJtWm9Va0FjQjFBcWs9

hmm all you need is a laptop with a built in camera it would be better to get multiple cameras but thats too complicated if you dont have a laptop with a camera you can find hps at your local target or electronics store and some are as cheap as <number> dollars then all you need to do is find a place to set it where your living room is in full view of the camera and keep it plugged in go to kickcom and set up an account start streaming and set a timer on your phone or watch for <number> hours once your timer rings go to the laptop end the broadcast and start a new one additionally if thats too much you could buy cheap handheld recorder and just always keep it in your pocket the problem with this though is people wont find it until after you die or if you manage to get away i wish you the best op and hope you can stop this guy and save those kids,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZM0U5amJGMnRHV1ZTWGY1TEdrWWpuTkY4dnBRTzJqeTc1YVE2djlyT1k4ZnpSVW5aQllUcEpRVlNMdmJHbGVBYWxlREljS19fbE9HLUswMkk1ZzRuSWc9PQ==

so theres obviously someone monitoring the wailers maybe even the people who interfere the red lights and alarm would be set off by the people who set the wailers loose and we could suppose that the van is either them picking up the wailer and the person that interferes or maybe the van is from someone else set out to catch the wailers or the people that interfere all we can know is that she was right you are being watched i think it safe to say that all the wailers are people related to at least one person in the building also must be determined if the rest of the age group buildings are also involved and set off as bait to catch more people for some reason other than to be used as wailers for the next victims i understand that you want to move back with your parents but youve been made a part of something that youll never forget and you just like the rest of us are gonna want answers if you dont stay try to keep contact with mey or mateo and ask them to talk to other residents try to find out if anyone has ever recognised a wailer and successfully ignored it or if there have been any strange happenings where things didnt follow through as expected good luck and please update soon edit grammar,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0WUF3Q1phZVM1UXJWMEJGYlBGelBoUnR1Skp2VWdhRjZ5UXpGRnBYOUhkdFJzNEY5R2pnVFBUTjhrZ1RLOTVVNENRQWlPZVFCZjlPWDhodTdKNDYxaEVmV2lhZWhMekUxOTZrd2VQN0o5LTQ9

thank you for your stories thirty plus years ago was my first introduction to anime and manga i am an old widowed grandma and this was before internet i was introduced by a guy who would be labeled an incel these days and all of it was practically pornographic i developed a quick lack of interest in anime except for that there was sailor moon over the years and my ex and sons all were obsessed with dragonball then my wise son rolled his eyes about a year ago and said mom you dont understand there is a lot of different kinds i think the first thing he had me watch was demon slayer by later last yearearly this year i got my own crunchyroll account as i watched a lot of his favorite shows though i began seeing repeated characters and i said these are completely based on japanese mythology and are the various spirits monsters etc developed in their culture and i went out and bought a book on yokai i agree that there can be real evil but as you have also learned sometimes a little knowledge and some empathy can get you through a lot of encounters i look forward to hearing more thank you so much this makes me very happy,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0MFJuNFh6YzBRdWRPcUhzMHowbkFOTVVORUd0cUxhQVUzdEZNaWpnZHNVOXVwbWNBS0p5ZEpWajVGOV8wMGxYUGlKM3F3X1NuV3c0bGVaUTc3cmRXNVE9PQ==
ill cop to a lot of anime inspired writing lol its something that was big for me as a kid who didnt really fit in first getting into the early series on toonami like dragonball and naruto hitting the us as i got into middle school it was great seeing so many stories about overcoming through sheer force of will and getting to see how the various spirits are interpreted and im jealous you have so much awesome to discover over the past few decades of animemanga its definitely diverse yokai are just fascinating to me as well even with all the terror theyve brought me some are so benevolent and just want to bring mischief but many are just misunderstood lost souls that are in search of belonging its often tragic especially when it comes to those like the teke teke,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0N1Jpa1h5eTROOEdYM0xXampiei0wYmFQTF9GUVZRR1dqZmFEaE40TF90dUgyeTlTN0lDNUFxQV9ybnlkdVN5NjJoY1l2SmJpWjFrREd4X29wbGVOclE9PQ==

i find myself agreeing theres a tragic solemn beauty to all of this for all of the horror the questions of agency and consent and boundaries are so very real and significant and yet expecting a consciousness as alien as the rain itself something that outside of his meat element experiences no such reality of boundary imagine how maddening to consider the sense of violence of violation of having your puddles splashed drops parted if such a concept were allowed to you ashley is right in her conflict and empathy here and her terror his overreaching is profound how do you teach the rain about healthy boundaries it starts with honesty i guess and in that sense grayson is exultant in finally showing his cards although he claims its too late to follow any other path but the inhuman notably arent very clear on the nuances of choice being denied the luxury i think its too early for ash and co to give up on him but grayson if you want to be a real boy you need to meet humanity on their terms and be upfront when your sense of understanding simply isnt grappling beau was an interesting contrast here,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1NVlhV0hwV3ZtY0txR1NSSEpRRzFUTTR1cDN5MlYxSmNhVHhYRUZBZW5WZ3JHZnhLUERQLTN4S2xIbUJVSlFoY1JidXJTcmRyZUU4Y0xCM3pYc3d5Nnc9PQ==

yeesh thats an uncomfortable position to be in a few pieces of advice first and foremost you should call your aunt becky play it off as a casual call just to check in after seeing her facebook post see if she mentions the fact that jeremy is living with you if she mentions it without you prompting it thats a good sign if not you can mention it and gauge her reaction dont install secret cameras in jeremys room this is very illegal and can likely get you expelled if not arrested but you should definitely check out his room some time when hes not home if only just to see if you notice anything unusual get a clear photo of one of these centipedes im sure there are apps that allow you to upload a photo of a bug to have it identified free trials are your friend but dont forget to cancel but otherwise you can get it identified on a buggy subreddit,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAyS1pIcGU1cDlkLUVtdnpxOGRzTnoxbzRyQW9PZUlIaTk0U3lMdjN4NDU4V216ck9YYWRJbWhwRU1TZmZaZ2M4aUZtcFdSNllQY1prQWxmck0tdXgtdVE9PQ==

iolo likes kissing you i know i said he doesnt see you as more than a pet but honestly im starting to wonder if he actually feels more for you than hes letting on and the hotcold treatment is because he doesnt know how to deal with it i wonder what his reaction would be if you kissed him first well either way he really messed up those poor winchesterwannabes i mean they did make a few situations worse but i dont think they deserved that at least they wont get involved with the cookie hag because if theyd been alive you know they wouldve found a way to get involved man youve had a rough few days and whod have thought youd ever get a neighbor girlfriend no you apparently lol you two are pretty cute together,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAyTjhtQlhBV1RNTmx1SmgyeXVDU25KbkRvbWlkdlBjMjViSExMQjhqQ2x6dEQ4RnZPZXI0U2xMTVFWUFhVNWQ1RGZVeEh1cVo3M3pSZnBHMld4VGV5OVE9PQ==

oh my gosh the fanfic would go so hard can you imagine if to distract him in a crucial moment nessa just kisses him on the mouth and hes so distracted that she manages to get away with whatever shes trying to do also why do i feel like hed actually sacrifice himself for her at some point i think he talks a very big game about tolerating her like when he threatened to rip her tongue out but he wouldnt actually do anything truly terrible to her i mean especially when you consider what hes been known to do to people who actually piss him off i feel like she could get him to that point where he wants to but i think hed stop himself at the last second youre so right he really shot himself in the foot there hes got no one to blame but his own self he couldve won so many points if he helped her with her grandpa that was tragic and for anyone who calls us crazy they need to remember its not obsession its dedication for her smh,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAycFV4T01JY3hMUjlxaEJBTG9XU2N5ZTYxOHlQUjNhTFVsQnMtYnZqVXhSTUkzaV9IS3BGS190QmlCMmRwNV93ZHQyOW9kTWlNckNZOVJhMXduc0lVamc9PQ==

so horrible  i walked into a chicken house and found a black snake stuck at the base of the hens neck it couldnt swallow any farther her feet were drumming like crazy i prayed it was because she was suffocating not past it and grabbed snake behind head and pulled my hen out of it she had chicks and probably struck at the snake as it attempted to take them then i was in a bit of a conundrum almost suffocated hen in one hand probably slightly upset <number>ftlong constrictor in the other lucky for me grandkids were visiting and had alerted me to the rope in the chicken house and followed me to see what they found my guess was it managed to get to the chicken when they came to the house for me one was handed the hen told to keep her still and warm and let me know if she didnt start breathing other was dispatched to retrieve grandpa so i had another set of adult hands to deal with the five foot long constrictor good times i know more now than i do now unfortunately it doesnt include perfectly keeping black snakes out of chicken houses sooner or later they figure out where they are,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjczJfb01wWWVaUXZVQkE4Q3ItNUdnU2R4RHZuaE0zWGJFbUcycDBRc1NMZENJUzg5Ny1zTExVRDI1cTkweWZNS1RfVUZFRlV2Y3M0LXlxN1k5RjFPVUE9PQ==

reddit recommended me here i didnt know there was a short horror story sub which is a ton of fun great writing i enjoyed how you started lighthumored and got darker as the story progressed it was only a bit but you got a sense of the family as a whole which makes the rest heartbreaking my only critique is snakes generally dont leave behind bones not unless they regurgitate prey before full digestion the python would leave behind massives poo tho and anything indigestible would persumably pass through maybe plastics their stomachs are impressive weird to say but i do appreciate you having the snake eat the small son a lot of people dont realize snakes cant eat most humans even these massive ones their jaws just cant get around the clavicles anacondas are the only ones that really break bones and even they dont go for it children andpetite adults arethe only ones at risk your massive python would need a lot of energy to move and to not waste that energy would definitely want to target children on purpose whelp that probably wasnt comforting sorry about the snake facts thank you for the fun read,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjM2xnajkzY0JlLV91UENuSUJBSW91TVdSRWFRRHd4bm9aMUJUeXdxX3lvbUdjbjNwSjI3U2VyTmtpb1F5NnpvelRaMUVYRV9YbzZzYlliYXUzVFhGOXc9PQ==

yes and she defended all of her chicks successfully my granddaughter was very good at holding her and keeping her warm while she got her breath back those snakes love eggs and since you dont close the chickens out of their chicken house or coop they can come and go as they please the frustrating thing about that adventure is my husband blew me off i finally had to walk to the house to get him none of the kids would hold an empty feed sack open for me to put the snake into he drove it to the top of the hill and it escaped out of the bag already when he went to set it free so he just walked back our state department of conservation states that they only grow six feet i know that is inaccurate because one we caught looked huge so he held it up as high as he could reach he was a hair under six foot and what was left on the ground still curled in a circle  we were guessing closer to eight feet or so must have eaten well,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjSE9LN0l6TUtPNF9HcEJBTmtjd2p6XzF2R1dQZ0FHSkZZblNIbkFaY0l5VlM5T25RYmFmYlFoNEhRN0I1VldJQzhSaGw5TXVQb2dQcGNFMm42ckRVRkE9PQ==

masterfully written god i love this its incredible awful of course but magnificent theres the obvious link to do not pray to the god in the desert<url> which also lives in a wall rather the wall happens to stand where the portal to the god is and needs to be covered up lest the god have more impact on our world but just being near the wall let alone seeing it is enough to cause ones mind to crack and its a red queens race anyway that we will ultimately lose were just buying time also reminded me of the borderlands a <number> foundfootage horror also about a church built on top of an underground labyrinth containing something deeply wrong a deity or demon or something we can neither comprehend nor ever hope to destroy especially this part > i am trapped suffocating in total darkness as some invisible fluid burns my skin but no matter how much i scream or cry i cant claw my way to freedom instead the more i thrash the more those ribbed mucus covered walls seem to compress around me until i can hardly breathe but most of all it reminded me of lovecraft the cosmic horror the minds being stretched like slinkies until they are hopelessly distorted the most we can hope for is to seal it up and try to forget about it lovecraft had a lot of great ideas especially cosmicism<url> but his writing was bogged down by his preoccupation with dreams disgusting racism and so on its hard to write a good story where a dream is a key plot point that improves the work rather than detracts from it it can be done but not often the entity in this story seems very similar to azathoth<url> the blind mad god at the centre of the universe it is both omnipotent and omniscient but also insane and sleeping our entire universe is merely its dream our reality is not real at all beyond azathoth itself > the boundless daemon sultan azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time and space amidst the muffled maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes lovecraft azathoth lives at the centre of absolute chaos a kind of primordial darkness deeper than the mere absence of lightit is the absence of reality altogether when the characters complained of darkness i dont think they were talking about the darkness in the church > with each step the darkness felt heavier mike > its so dark in here alec > its so dark in here marie > it sounded like he was saying its so dark in here mike of alec > slowly a kind of darkness seeped into my thoughts mike azathoth is surrounded by formless thralls dancing to strange music throbbing in time with his madness a discordant beat this story has no drums nor flutes but a piano however very much tracks > someone pressed a key on the piano and everything inside me came to a screeching halt it was dull and offkey a dreadful song a strange discordant tone weak and offkey mike > ancient legends of ultimate chaos at whose center sprawls the blind idiot god azathoth lord of all things encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers lovecraft i think the artist saw this he saw close enough to the centre to glimpse its domain and the dancers before desperately covering it all up in an act of both selfpreservation and selfsacrifice i think he painted the dancers tortured flayed suffering mindless and misshapen i think this is how the entity azathoth or whoever collects its dancers whether on purpose or without conscious intention when people see it they become enslaved by the madness of their broken minds the entity is unaware or doesnt care one way or another is that the fate of humanity to gradually be collected by this thing and all end up circling it dancing and writhing in agony until all of us are there and noone else remains and then when it wakes up and we all finally cease to be oblivion being far sweeter than the madness bestowed by azathoth > even the slightest glimpse of it would result in the utter and complete destruction to the beholder lovecraft > or maybe im just going mad mike reality is the dream of azathoth nothing is actually real beyond the terrible being itself at the centre of it all its all literally a dream not our dream but a dream nonetheless > i think i might be dreaming alec > am i dreaming marie > everything that had happened was just some kind of sick dream mike > slowly it came to me as a powerful truth that all the time id spent outside that room was a lie just a kind of dream all the daylight id since seen the mornings waking in my own bed the sight of londons skyline and the sound of a world made of bright and colourful things those memories were just thin plastic over a far deeper truth that room alecs collapse maries disappearance they were the only real things id experienced and the cold and damp and dark were all that remained to me there was no outside world all of that was a dream his dream

im extremely skeptical this story sounds so farfetched that if it did actually happen someone was most likely screwing around with you because the directions were way too specific to follow they were hazing you or playing with your mind or this is just one hell of a story made up i dont think in anyway that this grocery store is haunted i cant imagine why they would say stay away from the specific aisle or warn you that you might see a woman then telling you to put carts away and suddenly having carts piled on top of each other seems like some sort of antics whatever the case if you decide to go back there dont feed into the games theyre playing with you just know that youre being played with and asked for a raise,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FmLTBIMU5nc082OXhNWnZZQU85ekxFaVpTdnd2QjdPVGxFQ2NkeXZJam9qaGlheDZoRm1qTkxXd1JDVDhvLUlpODlLbmFibmdiNC1mOEhHVnB0SzVYSkE9PQ==

let me speculate pauline is definitely feeding this thing that comes out of the drain or sacrificing tenants to it the issue that both hinders you and saves you is the sleep paralysis the creature that the ritualistic sacrifice is connected to mentioned itself it can only consume people who are awake thus when it pushes you in an attempt to wake you up youre paralysis prevents it your inability to move also makes it question if youre dead the creature also uses your name in that final night potentially because pauline told it who is this cycles sacrifice the final night is its whatever deadline for a feast and screamed hard to wake you up no effect you either kept your cool perfectly or really was paralysed pauline failed to give it its due and it came back for revenge not under the effects of sleep paralysis she probably was way too obvious when awake and that creature took whatever it needed her lucky break noe you have a decision it seems keep up whatever demented stuff pauline is doing or move on and never look back,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FqNHFuVmNDMHB6LXlXZTFLR1owU09hMGdIb3dBMXVIdTIyaEJhMHR5bTNnakc3cFBmQzhpQlhUUGU3N2FoazNnUl9pRmNtYi1JdXlSTVVNTjNzZkE3dVE9PQ==

yeah it sounds like this revenant might have been dead for a while before getting back up again if the general condition of the hiker and their signature sun bleached jacket is anything to go by maybe their death anniversary happened recently my current theory is that the revenant was a victim of a hiking accident which is why it is attacking hikers fitting a particular physical profile i might have to if this is a revenant that cant be reasoned with the weathered hiker has already sent two thruhikers to the er and i cant bring kieran for backup as even with the bottle of river water trick he seems to have a fairly short leash regarding how far he can go from his river before the collar starts digging into his neck i foresee negations in my future,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FrQlNNak9LdG9NM1djYjcxVkFxRlpCeWd6THRVT3dUVHNNZGd3VERQbWk5UFBCTjR6RDhuU2FqUjZFdU5oUHFvaXJGS2xWd0R0aHBGa3JqSUw0VW91Ync9PQ==

my dad also had a camera he was obsessed with after he died none of us could ever get it to work right all of the pictures we took were dark or so blurry and distorted you couldnt even make out what they were we joked that maybe it had somehow imprinted on him like a baby animal with its parent maybe it was grieving his death just like we were now you have me wondering if we were more right than we realized and if we were maybe your dads camera was stuck in the anger phase of the grieving process,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3Fsd2l1QlhCUVZWdklCMzdPbVVVLVl0NUZtcVRGcWpBb2F4NU0xem1kWThNUTFVa09qbUJYMVBtQlAwVHNwMFZaamJXMi1DME1EZGZzOGo0akFCdzV2LWc9PQ==
maybe the camera worked in reverse as well like if you took a photo of a house fire with it it would undo the event maybe your dad found that out and thats why he took it everywhere so he could stop car accidents and explosions and other catastrophes you dont remember any happening when you were growing up because your dad undid them all just a thought,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FsakI0V2tpY290XzNBZVZuRWJuYVYtNHE4eU5TWGxicHJ0MV9zbnhZNzJrS24yVVI0ck5qZFpOQnBrNnoxMk1Rb3dvbTZuMGhOakdqYkc2RmhTWllQM2xYYjQ1Y2FXYzZvM2U0QU1jd0ZITmM9

yeah i was pretty upset too to find out that i would eventually reach a point where id have to spend sleep points just to continue existing i had really hoped i could eventually find a way to live a normal life like this but unfortunately even when you do everything right its still a race against the clock and i do end up discussing the prospect of moving my bed with my dad after making an effort to do it myself it seems a bit strange to him but nowhere near as weird as i had psyched myself out about it being though im guessing annie didnt suggest this seeing as how see she probably wouldve wanted me to take the initiative of doing it myself instead of making excuses she probably wouldve preferred it if i had taken a more selfsufficient route but i think at the end of the day she was just mainly concerned with whether or not it had gotten done and shes obviously not gonna complain about me having spent some time with my dad since she never really seemed to appreciate my habit of holing myself up in my room away from my parents,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpOEtWZjNyazJWMFo5dEJmTldCS0w4Umd1ckhWenRadDRsbm9tQzBQUTF5aVF4d2JrcmFQMm95dHI2TGs1aGt2aWNpQWJ4ODZoclkzdzFiRFJnVHNhNmc9PQ==

as of now from outside the box youre both alive and dead clearly the evil man doesnt understand quantum mechanics to be both alive and dead their lives should depend on a quantum phenomenon not on something that happens in the future ie finding the key from the outside of the box the state of the victims is simply unknown to an outside observer whilst in the schrodingers cat the state of the rather unlucky cat is fundamentally undefined it is simply unknown what happened in the box it is not undefined glad youve made it out tho as someone whos an amateur about quantum mechanics i couldnt help but point that out,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqVXowWHJpZ0lSaUozUTZWMnpjRmFvU2NvWkFydUxZeGh5bjZPejVZZ3RYVldIdDMxai1IR29wanJHV1htdkVsQkFWNi1DZ1VoaXJlM2d0NU1Nekdqenc9PQ==

the state of the cat inside the box is undefined until observed the schrodingers cat is a paradox that something is both dead and alive imageing the concept of particle duality or in most cases a superposition case as an example that is the particle can be both a wave or a particle until observed as soon as it is observed it takes a state schrodingers cat is meant for criticism to the copenhagen interpretation that when the cat is not observed it can be both dead and alive until the box is opened but you are completly right about the key when the quantum state the persons depend on finding the key then it doesnt image the paradox anymore to make it right it should depend upon when the outside observer decides to unlock the door and observers our statesd,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqbkpoaUhTY01jc1RjWjVIRHlkMGVkdUZqTlJQclZIZ2cwa3R5ZnN2c0dkWDlSS1kwS2VpRkxmNWJpdXpCSWpZNl9YMjFDV3NLOVpYcURzc2NlYThuUmc9PQ==

so i have chronic migraines like confirmed by neurologists and a boatload of tests ct scans mris mrvs lumbar punctures and a couple of rounds of occipital nerve blocks i dont know whats going on with you but they dont even sound like migraine other than the headache part migraine doesnt cause confusion or memory loss if painkillers or high doses of an antihistamine are administered they can cause the memory loss but not a migraine on their own vestibular migraine could cause the dizziness but its recommended to seek emergency medical treatment with those because theyre so closely related to strokes and as far as counting to ten to will yourself calm and meditating the migraine away thats not a thing once a brain becomes trapped in the pattern of activity congruent with migraine scientists are still exploring but it seems the brain wave pattern is related tando seizure activity the only way to free it from that cycle is several hours of deltawave sleep delta wave sleep cannot be triggered or induced by drugs it can only be brought on through the natural progression of sleep cycles not to mention all the other health issues you seem to have interconnected to one another so i dunno whats going on with you but it isnt migraines somebody is lying to you telling you that a symptom is the disease,r/nosleep,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0d09jRXBFVklXMGd2T0ljQlloR0Rubi1hUWM1X212YkFrOXVCVXh6ekFNcW1BX1pSemM4dHFvb2swcXBfVHNobzhpcHphWXU0OFEzRFpaNzZTUGlVcm03SnhjM2QzdVh0eElna3lyQjlpU2M9
