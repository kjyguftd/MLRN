i did my masters on rtgs not only are they completely different from nuclear reactors other than using nuclear fuel and to add to that they use plutonium <number> which is not used in nuclear reactors but a byproduct of producing plutonium <number> theyre are also far from efficient rtgs were not designed with efficiency in mind their strengths are very long life and stable output in terms of power to weight ratio theyre pretty bad also most energy is radiated away a very low percentage is converted to electricity,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc0F6bFFjUFc4cDhIU0V6Z00yTGo4MUNFLU9FUF9qc3hybXUycjFpYllTX0Z4TVQwS2JmVjUtWlJ1VGpYZGNIVURIMWppbi1IQ0Q1cUIwS0JsWGwwckE9PQ==

i will remind you that france is the model for decarbonization and its power generation is what germany should emulate france has had a per capita carbon footprint that is a fraction of germanys for decades it has been about <number> years since the news emerged so my memory is a little bit weaker the garzweiler coal mine was expanded there was a hilarious story about germany destroying wind turbines to expand its coal mining<url> there was also the much more somber story about the village of lutzeranth being demolished<url> to extract more coal that was done to provide fuel for the coal fired power plants that were being restarted<url> the incredible stupidity of this was that a supposedly green party that supposedly cares about climate change did this while continuing to shut down its non polluting and non carbon emitting nuclear power plants nuclear power plants which also release far less radioactive material per gwh of power produced than coal power now for a little common sense when coal fired power plants are restarted in germany that means german coal use increases the only way that coal use wouldnt increase is due to highly energy demanding industries like steel ammonia cement etc shutting down and leaving germany that de industrialization is also a bad thing when germanys strong industries were the reason for germanys economy being so much stronger than the rest of the eu countries a lot of the german chemical industry ended up moving to louisianas cancer alley the fact that germany also burns so much fossil gas is only marginally better than burning coal gas isnt so great the supposed hydrogen economy uses equipment that will also work for gas and i suspect that the plans for a hydrogen economy are merely a front to continue burning so much gas i guess it is great for the qatari royal family and the texas fossil fuel companies that i despise france is the model to emulate when trying to decarbonize a power grid france has been outperforming germany in decarbonization for decades,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZnBrUzdhSWZzWUNFeWNPSVdlYmY1SGhXWXFFaXlsVXR6aEhBOGdkR0dUOFhaRG12bDh1VFdJQ3hoNVFRaWVUTEtDWUJzU2QwcGQ1aWhGa0ZCZ2MwTEE9PQ==

most of the plutonium <number> was basically a byproduct of producing plutonium <number> for bombs after the initiative to reduce the stockpiles was taken up by the ussr and usa plutonium <number> production was stopped and as a result production of pu as well russia sold most if not all its pu to the us and since then the us supply is dwindling thats why theres been research into more efficient devices but aside from improvement to the basic rtg design no other concepts caught on its true that heat is a huge part of the energy we use but in most parts of the world the issue is theres no infrastructure for it one thing the communists got right in my opinion is they invested heavily into chp plants and district heating systems many cities in countries like poland czech republic slovakia ukraine lithuania latvia estonia have district heating systems which could be supplied with nuclear rather than coal and im pretty sure poland is aiming to do the same,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYT0YwTVhXT1lBOV9lOXN2ZmRwNjdWUVZjU2RvUkJ4RXZyTkpfQXRuQmlOREpZX0d0TjlIVzUtR29BWFN2WXlYVDRnN0xnb2xWX3k0ZkI1UkVsd09HRFE9PQ==

not great overturning the chevron deference opens up challenges to pretty much every standard in the industry where there isnt an explicit standard or number in the law the courts will be sorting out lots and lots of cases corporations will be very skittish because now nrc or epa standards are not shields against claims of negligence the supreme court also overturned cabin post which now allows a complainant to sue within six years of when a law started impacting them negatively not the old standard of within six years of the laws passage this creates another administrative mess where new businesses can rediscover some decades old law is impacting them and pursue a legal rulingwhich may be an administrative standard under chevron and is now open to relitigation decades later unless congress gets really technically savvy by bringing hundreds of nrctype folks into permanent legislative committee staffing and starts passing lots of very detailed laws the whole nuclear administrative state will begin unraveling probably slowly and then all of a sudden,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMFgwd09Pc1BIdDlkakJRVWVjOUxKWnc1ckFjYTVDZnFsZGpiSmJKMWFDVGllZDRZWnlTOXhNcURheU50WlpiUFRSZXlWUTdrdk04alhucy1YQVhpS2lCZlpoU2IyeFE4YWRXRnFfUDAtUEE9

do you feel the chevron defense significantly affected nuclear power in the s in general removing arbitrary powers from a regulatory body would tend to be good for the industry that is being overseen but i dont think nuclear power stalled because the nrc was unreasonable or overly heavyhanded but primary for economic issues outside the control of nuclear power itself growth of electricity demand was much lower for a couple reasons than previously expected and cheaper sources of power natural gas for instance were available ng was cheaper because of the significant costs of the large upfront capital costs of a nuclear plant especially in a high cost of capital period so since the nrc wasnt the primary organization keeping plants from being built i dont think chevron being passed in the s is what crushed nuclear power and i dont think removing it will lead to some huge rebound there could be a rebound we hope but it wont be because of the end of chevron,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYXhyTUEyalVwS2JoWl9wTmMwTWZDcEJJdVQwMm80LWcwWHV1ZF9LSkowd1ozdWhFNGhvVkdBamUyRkpZSWN3VTRPT2pfcjdHS05STF9UMmNhYVhkbmc9PQ==

the crux of the chevron deference is that congress makes vague laws or delegates its constitutional authority to executive agencies when congress wants to fix a technical issue this makes practical sense congress isnt super knowledgeable about how much heat a plant should be able to reject to the environment which species of eagles are endangered or how much cadmium is an acceptable amount in flour the scotus has said this is wrong congress needs to make their wishes explicitly known or the courts get to rule on a casebycase basis as the designated branch in charge of interpreting law or the individual states should set their own limits this is a mess for everything from liability interstate commerce future business planning and just having government work on any topic that is the tiniest bit technical,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQmxoNTgyMUttNmozejV5bUh4SUNQYmUtV1FYVVk3VURPeXRyZTJfbS1TRXlYTnpnX3lXTGVZcGpTRkpWaTNFVVZVQVFQbWNTYTFqRno0ZUpzV3JQZ2pvT0phOUczeEVCTHJYLVNsazdkeG89

it gives courts a lot more power to decide what is within and against regulations in theory this could bypass much of the redtape making new construction slow and expensive but in practice it will probably open up the way for a many many lawsuits even in cases where all regulations were followed and where no harm was done just have a look at how any technical topic is handled in count to see how well those will go there are people willing to sue over literally anything and quite a lot of judges that wont honor accepted standards when given a convincing sob story we very might well see lawsuits along the line of an alpha particle came within <number> feet of me now you guys have to pay my hospital bill its hard to find a more controversial industry with a less informed populace then nuclear power so even though other industries hurt far more people nuclear will probably get a disproportionate amount of lawsuits the only real way to avoid this is if extremely specific and detailed laws get passed that leave almost no room for interpretation removing language like as low as reasonably achievable,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQVVfRFVld1F4N21VVE45Z0JoaU5iU0E4WjNnVzVXMVBTVVJ2R1p1Rm92aTZ1Vi03dFRpQmU3YkVyREtNV0VURzFvajNJalJ2ZmV2a0VfQ1JUV0ItZnc9PQ==

im not disagreeing with you if im remembering my legal eagle video correctly i believe the chevron defrence was only for ambiguity in law i could be wrong though but i think the other person might be correct the point im making is that if thats the case the regulations can still be rather ambiguous and easily brought into question if a regulation says you need x amount of y thats pretty clear and unambiguous any regulation that doesnt have a number associated with it can be questioned as being ambiguous,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaEQyNmlRdEMxSU93Y2t0bUp5RElwNHJuQ1Q2S3BqMFJ2eWlodUp0LXJuZXpLSURZSUF5TjFUakoxVHJqU1h0cXA1ZGVjcWh3SHpxS1lfdkRZelZTR1E9PQ==

i am not a lawyer im fairly sure that it applies to regulation the laws are written to be broad so that regulators being the experts can write the appropriate regulations this goes over the chevron defrence test the first part of the test is a challenge to an executive agencys intepretation of federal law so it definitely applied to federal regulators like thats where the rubber met the road when it came to busting out chevron defrence <url><url> my understanding is that now if there is any challenge to a regulators interpetation of a statue you can no longer use this chevron deference now its up to the courts to decide i think potentially pushing it back to congress to pass a law to remove ambiguity,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU1BhZFlBTkd0aGRrQW5NT243TEdUUEctRjRlUU5CTldYSXR5UDl0MGNFck1RV1dzQ0xFcEpUR2Rnem9GRmpMTGRVa1N4RXhHNmFySUpUd2ZBMHJGZ1E9PQ==

speaking from outside the usa some industries need specialist regulation the whole point of setting up specialist regulators is that the task requires deep skills in a niche which national legislators dont have and it usually requires a rulebased system which doesnt perfectly fit the existing system of national legislatures and courts so the government delegates some authority to a group of specialists to draw up detailed rules and some monitoring enforcement mechanisms its good to have a separate regulator which deeply understands the nuclear industry or food hygiene or vehicle safety or banking or drug testing and which is granted the ability within some boundaries to write rules interpret them and enforce them in a way that fits how the industry works outcomes for industries and the public would be worse if this was done by the average politician and policeofficer ending chevron deference undermines that just a little bit it doesnt abolish the whole system but definitely weakens it in situations where a regulated entity has the time money for a big court case i wont pretend that all these regulators are <number> perfectly competent but where they make mistakes they should be corrected worst case scenario abolish the regulator and give its duties to somebody else instead of undermining the whole system,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYV0o3aUtJVHNsam10d3FZSkNsREJzOGNnTVBxZDZ6MWZlek56a3NZS3pHblM0WlpaTUx5bWZLeHpnRnZMTTVGODFVMVdPbGs1ZGhMcFhnN3paUnFhWkl6VFh0WGxFM09EWldxcjlfMjJKcWs9
that is blatantly not the majority opinion lauren boebert got laughed at in a congressional hearing the other day for spouting that exact nonsense the majority opinion overturns chevron and returns statutory review to the justice system over the ambiguity in statutes it does not change deference of mattersoffact and it doesnt change the power of legislative delegation delegation to the executive branch is how literally every aspect of the government works not just regulation that would be a constitutional crisis this is not congress must be explicit in the scope of authority given to agencies now or else the courts will decide that scope for them for many federal agencies this is not a big problem their scope is already welldefined in statute most federal agencies do have some grey areas but they affect only small portions of their focus the nrc has explicit delegation of authority over radiation special nuclear material and byproduct materials among a few other categories it will be largely unaffected,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY2U5UFdKbk5TTFBUQl9rTlQ5bGV3S1N5MDJWZXJJVS1iQ3gzNTlGYXFTSHpfR3BoVXFJSWxpaDkwTFdRd0RUcDVKX3ZCcDhmX3VjVEVNYVNzeW5pT0E9PQ==

this is still wrong congress does not have to be explicit in its rulings this is a misinterpretation of chevron and loper bright congress may still delegate authority but courts may decide when a federal agency has overstepped its authority where the law is ambiguous courts still have to defer to federal agencies on matter of fact and regulations can be made within delegated authority but if a law is unclear on whether a federal agency can legally make a rule pertaining to something then the courts can judge that issue,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWnFjZV9CcnhKRkVKWlgzcGRodTUxU1NRV0dEQ3FpZDlwcXVaMnJ0RVpKUElIeEd1RUVsT0lVOFUxVk80NExYUldWMnNlUThGdVVGS0daSHJaQlE5Rnc9PQ==

really the objective would be to have reactors in the us that can burn spent fuel as soon as possible but from your comment and others it seems its not feasible as well as overall more productive to keep the reactors we have but start building ones that can burn spent fuel,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRUtmQTZjcEFOcUMzcVV3TG9LRnJiNmQwdjBUalFYU0RiZUV2S3FxQmh1VlR4M2JHT0k1RGdjdENTWWg0RXVhYlM3LW55eDBZRVd2ZzJIVGpJUUh3UXc9PQ==

theres methods of processing used fuel to make new fuel the french do it and iirc about <number> of their fuel comes from reprocessing its illegal in the us for proliferation reasons as it means plutonium handling by civilians it doesnt require changing the reactors at all because its the same straight through uu mix as for running off of spent fuel its much more challenging yes you want fast reactors for this as the cross section of u favours fast neutrons it turns into neptunium and then decays to plutonium then another neutron hit and you get fission i dont know enough to comment as an expert im an armchair who has simply read copious amounts unless i stand to be corrected this doesnt really help much as its still inefficient in a solid fueled reactor you run it without a moderator i dont know if the presence of cesium and strontium thats produced as standard waste gums up the works there are radically different designs built specifically for this instead of zirconium clad rods of fuel you use salt to chemically bind to the heavy elements in a liquid chloride or fluoride chemistry lets all these heavy elements flow so arent encumbered by the limiting physics of solids you can then burn down a lot more of the material to your original question the answer is no i believe any change to fuel cycles requires different reactor characteristics fuel shape different neutron economy moderation coolant etc too much to modify existing reactors,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3p4YksyMjdsT25CZDZHWUxrcUh5VnVJd0NYZHhsYUVrZlhydzNDOHAwRk5HZk02Z2JCbnFXcU9DZzBLQ0FjU1ptMGpYYzc3MTVGd3dtRVphYTBRb3c9PQ==

oh its not as though current power reactors cant recycle spent fuel they dont use it very efficiently is all recycled uranium needs reenrichment and because lwrs are undermoderated the uranium<number> that formed the first time around by nonfission capture unavoidable in a thermalneutron reactor acts as a neutron poison so you have to enrich to for instance <number> to get the effect of <number> enrichment from mined uranium on the other hand a candu reactor fed with uranium recovered from spent lwr fuel containing about <number> u<number> will achieve something like <number> mwdkg as against roughly <number> mwdkg with normal uranium because of the softer neutron spectrum the effect of u<number> is about <number> smaller and a very small increase in initial fissile content leads to a big increase in burnup and fissions per initial fissile atom atucha <number> a pressurevessel hwr went from <number> mwdkg with normal uranium to <number> with <number> enrichment the argument can still be made that newlyenriched uranium is cheaper than reprocessed u but to my mind doubling the amount of energy you get from the reprocessed material makes the economics of reprocessing better plutonium can also be used in lwrs or in candu of course and bwrs in particular can use pubased fuel more efficiently in the upper lessmoderated portion of the core which is why japan settled on lwrmox rather than continuing with the fugen type of hwr nevertheless proceeding to build at least a demonstration sprism makes a huge amount of sense we shouldnt expect to build economical fbrs right away but we need to start building them anyway in order to get the experience needed for building economical ones now how do you fund that,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeVdIYWZ0QjdXMkc3eExRTU1PYmN6S0oyOVdtZ0JxT2I3OGg5aTIxSU5KajNVS1lvbklwT2xiWnZMR1l4UGR3dWJ0UjB6VnBXVXlWT2ZZV3NmVktCU1p5MWk0azZJOTl5NGxUUHB6Q1dUT289

in north texas there is a district that has only one federal judge this judge is known to have a very clear agenda that is not in line with the rest of the nation groups seeking to push that agenda actively work to bring legal matters to that particular district in order to get a judge who will always rule in their favor now that the courts get to make decisions on regulations it seems like it is not impossible for an environmental antinuclear organization to find or manufacture a similar district where there is only one or two federal judges who are on their side and start bringing antinuclear cases before that court in theory they could use this to shut down the entire nuclear industry in the us not saying that is likely to happen but it isnt impossible now big oil and coal certainly have a lot more lobbyists and legal departments trained to accomplish underhanded things like this and i dont know that nuclear has nearly that kind of legal budget,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTkxoaVhXSUxmbTdmYWYzakEwcGpqX053aWpVQmZsc3A5ZU5jemtobTlvSkQ3MkV1WXVjd3gyN1RtMkZTUmZYTkVsTEZhZEVUMTU0blBOcnh4R3VfMUE9PQ==

there is no evidence of linear no threshold having any validity people who live at high altitudes do not have higher cancer rates than people who live at low altitudes despite a higher exposure to radiation from having less atmosphere blocking solar and cosmic radiation their exposure levels are safe there are already radioisotopes in your body and you cant live without them all potassium is radioactive because it contains a radioisotope potassium<number> all water is radioactive because it contains the radioisotope tritium also called hydrogen<number> all carbon is radioactive because it contains the radioisotope carbon<number> you breathe and are constantly exposed to the radioisotope radon<number> because it simply emerges out of the earth there is no validity for being scared of words like radiation radioactive radioisotope etc we live on a radioactive planet and are exposed to safe levels of radiation all life is built to be able to handle it the radiation doses that all life received on earth would have been higher billions of years ago than it is today people even expose themselves to higher than average levels of radiation as healthy practices like soaking in water from volcanic hot springs that are more radioactive than the wastewater from nuclear power plants going outside in bright sunlight so that the ionizing uv radiation stimulates vitamin d production in their body immersing their bodies in radioactive monazite sand to stimulate healing etc dose matters and it takes a lot to clearly cause harm<url> there are also far greater unaddressed chemical threats that should be a far greater concern than radiation pfas are a clear example like the ones used in solar panels and wind turbines for weather proofing weather proofing is a clear necessity when equipment is exposed to the weather then there are the emissions from fossil fuels which have been horrible here is a good reason to support nuclear power<url> so little waste gets produced for the power generated that it is possible to shield and isolate it which is what has been done if youre concerned about safety then nuclear power is the safest power source available especially if rbmk reactors are omitted with the <number><number> deaths caused by chernobyl accident pwr bwr and candu reactors have an unprecedented safety record linear no threshold has been tremendously damaging in blocking nuclear powers adoption through over regulation and driving up costs people have become so unreasonably scared of it that they will instead support more environmentally harmful and unreliable methods of power generation like solar panels and wind turbines,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLThJVlI5VEY0NHZDTzh2WFdKeVNiZGM0YUJwQ2xNUGlqczdPWmNlWFdsbWRuVS1PZDlwVjdXY1Jod3ZEemVEcHZvaFlMLTFZZW1Pckp1cXRxN1lpdVE9PQ==

spent nuclear fuel contains large amounts of neutron poisons that are removed to mantain good neutron economy generally fuel remains in the reactor until burnup and neutron poison build up requires most of the control rods to be withdrawn or soluble poisons removed from reactorin the case of pwr this can cause problematic power fluctuations if i recall correctly iirc candu reactors typically use natural uranium however they can use spent low enriched lwr fuel that is repurposed mechanically not chemically into the correct fuel using breeder reactors to produce fuel for a burner reactor would be counter intuitive as it would lose the main advantage of breeding a selfsustaining amount of fissile material blanket regions from a fast reactor could conceivably be used directly in a thermal reactor however the fuel would still probably need to be mechanically reprocessed,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhb25ISGx2X2ZkVkhkdE1lNEpsdjBjNzJpdXZUTlc1NVdtX0UxMldTRC1oX2tZN3RCd3B4a1pHdmdCb3N0a1FUaDM1MWtzcU9aSDlYNWxXVG5aSEltOEE9PQ==

probably the only thing that gets close to it is going to be molten salt reactors which sort of eliminate the issues with neutron poisons if you can remove them during reactor operations ie venting gaseous poisons however youre somewhat still left with chemical processing at some stage important to note that the us has never really had much of a reprocessing program and its few ventures eg hanford were for specific purposes but not for civil plutonium reprocessing at least to my knowledge im fairly certain on this a more apt example would be either magnox reprocessing plant or thorp i dont know much about marcoule or la hague im not quite sure what youre inferring about the mess that goes with reprocessing certainly there have been issues but particularly with the us a lot of those issues were due to legacy mistakes in fact a lot of nuclear decommissioning and remediation is fixing legacy issues which does a hell of a lot more remediation than conventional toxic companies do the other issue is that having an open nuclear fuel cycle means you need to do something with the plutonium youre generating the option most if not all nuclear states pick is mixed oxide mox fuel if you decide you dont want to make mox fuel anymore then you end up sitting on a lot of plutonium which suddenly doesnt really have much of a purpose except for some niche uses and rd feeds i think its a bit silly really to take a resource you have and chuck it into the ground when it can be used for new fuel but what do i know,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhT3dKZW5xTERjRzhEak1OQ3F0UGJvZGNWTFZ2cGlGQXg5SnZrQUFVN1BDdXBTYThMUTJrLUZvMkxOZkRBN2w4M3lMZ1VoTnhrczhSUktBNUhIbXNNd1E9PQ==

chemical reprocessing is necessary but not always at every step already in the s it was suggested that the outer breeding blanket for fbrs could be in the form of fuel assemblies suitable for use in converter reactors fabricated from plain thorium oxide in zirconiumalloy tubes these assemblies would accumulate a considerable fraction of uranium<number> but very little fission products while in the fbr then be pulled from the reactor washed and inserted directly into converter reactors they would be too hot to handle without special apparatus but this is arguably an advantage from safeguards considerations the main problem with this is bad behaviour of zr alloys in sodium above <number> c but the outer blanket could be kept in cold sodium below this temperature if no other solution can be found personally i suspect that some combination of alloy selection steam preoxidation of the cladding used on some lwr fuel in the s possibly plating with niobium or something similar and hottrapping of the sodium with zirconium foils could solve the problem an alternative which i have considered is using spent converter fuel assemblies in the breeding blanket to increase the proportion of plutonium before reprocessing this is particularly interesting in the case of candu fuel a second benefit is the second chance nn reaction on uranium<number> which has the fascinating result that the depleted uranium in the discharged bundles ends up containing more <number> than before you put it into the breeder making its recovery value greater and of course the ifr concept includes a small nonaqueous reprocessing facility for driver fuel at the plant site although reprocessing of blanket fuel might need to be handled some other way,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQ0t3a3FQWHdpYWdHMTVuZjRWaC01aEZNQ0xmLVJCVGctYkQ1SHc2QmJuZkV2TFZ4YzQyYThQU0dkVkVScnl2UENPU3BvMWlLaWxDVXNGOThOdEtWSHVBY0FoMDVzMTAybHNPajVrNGdIS1E9

there was some work in the s on a mixed economy of converters and breeders it makes sense in some circumstances in particular when the converters are very neutronefficient and use very dilute fuel as is feasible with candu this can allow for lower overall fuelcycle costs than a pure breeder economy in part because of the greater fissions per initial fissile atom value in candu as compared to either lwr or fbr it also makes safeguarding the nuclear fuel cycle easier by consolidating all breeder reactors and fuelcycle operations on a small number of sites i have illustrated this in my publication blast <number><url> and gone into some detail in the online notes,r/nuclear,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZUJ6X3kybjhHcnJQbVBDalJubWlUTWgtVTBWQkJwTXdkQnBkd3cxM2N4T1BTOE1JMHZCYjE5clJ6ZF9TREhsRmFsSndMLTdsQ01CSUVDb1VweldNZDR3cjBxZFRCUFhCTXo5dXlWUE5MZWs9
