france is leading the way in nuclear waste segregation and mid term storage which is a big part of nuclear power they also have a mature infrastructure for producing and disturbing the fuel i didnt know theyd fallen behind on reactor site development though that makes me sad i had doped at least france wasnt so short sited as to brain drain the skills for reactor site development as for frances eventual grid collapse i was under the impression they were pretty extreme electricity exporters couldnt they throttle that back if needed edit this got me thinking if france isnt building more reactors how is their power consumption changing over the last few decades i found the ieaorg site i only did light vetting please let me know if theyre a known bad source first something goofy happened in <number> frances electricity consumption dropped a lot and their imports jumped past their exports for the first time ever so ignoring the oddity of <number> france exports about <number> of their nuclear power generation they seem to be replacing nuclear dependence primarily with nat gas but recently they started with wind at their current rate france has another <number> years before wind generation could replace nuclear so yeah france had better get on the ball and build some new <number> yr reactors,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYXzR4dERMeHlGTEZkSHZ5Ql8tZERGM01DNDVEbzk2djNQQTlIZzBYQnhfeVVlbnY0VVdtZFkwRzJXZmFIVTNxZ2xKMVFmY09hUzhNYkFzeUZqZW1wd0E9PQ==

the real issue is relative cost and not cost today but relative costs <number> years from now for example if you started work on a nuclear reactor today between regulatory requirements and construction times it wont be operational for ten years if it is being compared to say solar andor wind feeding a utility scale battery then the nuclear plant needs to be economically competitive with the cost of the solarwind plus batteries ten years from now since these costs have been dropping over the last ten years it is tricky to predict what the costs will be ten years from now when a utility is looking at a multi billion dollar investment that wont pay off for a decade it doesnt want to be in the position of trying to sell power against a competitor that has a significantly lower cost of construction and operation that uncertainty is a significant problem,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc3cwUVJmWXZPNlFrTm02bTVjWVVvWXF0QXF1Y0V5QnFOUG1fZ3A4dWdJSnladWdrc2Q0bUlFZjNyWFFueGxOdXdPOEFUNFUtUjk3eHhRMnlNc1dYUHc9PQ==

any militarygvmt is going to find a way to create weapons grade uraniumplutonium with or without a commercial plant as a counterexample being a canadian in canada there is a robust industry that is focused purely on power production and improving healthcare with nuclear science canada will never have a nuclear weapon it may be true in some or many cases that military ambitions will influence the building of commercial power reactors but that doesnt need to be true if it is true and it amounts to a net social benefit as a low carbon energy source then whats the issue if military was going to find a way to enrich fuel anyways climate change is the real and most present issue are we losing the plot the argument goes both ways the social media nukebros and renewabros is very polarized and many probably havent even stepped foot in either industry the viewpoints seem to be all nuclear or no nuclear renewables either very good or very bad there is little room for rationale and moderate conversation dont get me wrong i would prefer to see a fully renewable solution but there are situations where nuclear might be best and the polarization and lack of proper discourse betrays the best possible outcome you arent contributing positively to this btw,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWl8yMGZzc0prbUpUSDRTc0dmczJ0YzhDUVlsMEpseThmOFRzX1VJMnY1MTZ1c3lMZ1VOMVFsNnhRR2QxelY0LW0yN1JhOVIwM1JiVVdwREFPMDJBZ0E9PQ==

i guess you missed the second paragraph half the military side is nuclear weapons the other half is naval reactors powering mainly submarines those require the same industry like the one canada has the problem is that renewables and nuclear does not match as renewable penetration increases simply by virtue of being the cheapest energy source around nuclear power is pushed out of the grid given current cost structures and outcomes of nuclear projects there is no investing in both investing in renewables will make any nuclear power plant projects started today dead on arrival which is what the climate change denying right wants better invest in nuclear delaying solutions to fix climate change than having to face a green world,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWkJsLTZrd2pwZDBmLS1KYmk0UXJDLUhXbzFPMHZrR1FCZlNDWmxvV0R3V29MbUxBeVl4d19Ha25PdXpJOU5XVF9lbW1LMTliS1BaaUFmOGk2R1FIWnc9PQ==
well i was working for a canadian telecoms company at the time so my experience is unlikely to be very useful other than generalities but for grid operators theres only eirgrid so you might want to peruse their job listings too esb is the largest plant operator and i suspect theyll have jobs very similar to an ro but those plants will be deemphasized as they shift to renewables the existing grid is mostly coal and peat and since i was there a lot of new gas as well theres got to be jobs at these plants that will be supersimilar to an ro role these are spread across the country so geography is not really limiting you you can have a look at this list which is pretty complete<url> but the real story is their wind buildout theyre adding about <number> to <number> of their total capacity every year in new wind they have not even really begun to tap their offshore capacity and there are huge resources around sligo galway bay dingle bay and the shannon estuary that can plug right into the existing coalfired transmission network from locations like tarbert moneypoint and tawnaghmore my feeling is that will be mostly west coast although even dublin bay is pretty shallow and theyll likely be studying that too so my question back what are you looking for in a new location i absolutely loved the west coast but im a bit of an introvert and the slower pace really fit me well any town above k is more like what you would see in a small city here so i was in ennis which is like k people and found it fun and lively downtown while still being a quiet town at night but if youre looking for more action dublin is <number> of the entire county and thus eye wateringly expensive so that has to be an option but you can also look to cork k and especially galway which had an absolutely fantastic nightlife for a population of k here in canada a town of k has a couple of eateries trying to be fancy and some totally cookiecutter pubs trying to pretend theyre british so whats your speed,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMkU4MlBmR0NkTmx5aFExSm9vZFI0SG45bHVCanZuLThZaFJhMV9YN2VPNERoZTN0cUhzeVNwMk5zMWNQaFpkR0RRMjN3bXh2TmwzS1FyZHRxRlI0emc9PQ==

in a western pwr design when water is replaced by steam in the primary circuit for example in the case of a breach the core is no longer cooled and the neutrons are no longer moderated because steam is a worse coolant and moderator than liquid water because the neutrons are no longer moderated slowed down reactivity is reduced without intervention also higher fuel temperature due to coolant loss has an adverse effect on reactivity this is called the doppler effect thats why a pwr design is safer than a rbmk because if for any reason liquid water stops being fed to the core the reactor stops by itself very quickly you still have to deal with radioactive decay heat in your fuel though so you have to find a way to resume cooling the core after some time,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMEZVUlk0OGVFM3lSUENzVEJfQ3JRVmhZNHVpdDgxeGVPMEtKNW5YRVNBMlItTjA0SU9YTDFFN2o4T3dxdDVyR3NKR3Uzb2pCMml3RjF0T2NVd3NiZnc9PQ==

>wait so in the absence of a moderator the reactor goes subcritical exactly moderating the neutrons slowing them down is in fact what allows the fission reaction to be possible u which is the most commonly used fuel in reactor designs will only capture and fission with slow neutrons neutrons that have encountered a moderator water graphite you moderate the speed of the neutrons to make the fission chain reaction possible even a higher temperature of the water in pwrs without it becoming steam is enough to reduce reactivity because higher temperature > lower density > less moderation by the way fast neutron reactors are another type of reactor designs that dont rely on moderation because they do not use u,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacUp0RTlwaHowd1h2WTNwdVhXQmpKdEJRbDRpRzhXVUpCMEszcXoxbm9GeGl6ak1JOGh6YlhOclY3V3IzNWpYamVlMHpoZG1Gcm5jWjZUX2NONy1oTkE9PQ==
this is making more sense in pwr reactors is the effect of the moderator greater than the effect of the coolant since greater core temperatures > more steam voids in coolant > less cooling > even greater core temperature > more fission reactions and at the same time greater core temperatures > more steam voids in moderator > less slowing down of neutrons > less probability of fission > fewer fission reactions in other words does the effect of the moderator overshadow the effect of the coolant in this case,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaREpRY0c3RVZVYVg2YWdJZ1NyNmZPQVB1Nk5tbnFQajg1V1ZDSVBpNHRvMnhfdFM5dmhIYUI3cVBGZ2hQNko0TUdmaHBvRTJSNi1ZS1dTYnk3eXRKWnc9PQ==
the coolant is the moderator in pwrs and bwrs more moderation generally means more reactivity so the more energy the fuel adds to the coolant the hotter it gets the less dense it gets either via sub cooled heating or boiling the less moderation there is the less reactivity there is it is a self correcting system so if you want to raise power you can withdraw control rods which removes a little bit of the neutron absorber from the core which overall adds reactivity to the core which causes more fissions which adds heat which raises the temperature of the fuel which raises the temperature of the coolant which lowers in density due to hotter water or steam which reduces moderation of the coolantmoderator which lowers reactivity which lowers fissions which reduces heat which lowers the temp of the fuel which lowers the temp of the coolantmoderator which raises in density due to cooler water or less steam etc on the whole it is still a net power addition but the design of the system is self regulating,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeTVNWTdqaXEtanhiaGg5U1NZazZRbjQ2YjdKNEItRERVaVhpSmJEa2wyR0RqUndLbkxnWUlFMWE4aGROVE9mX0xob0xLOFVtNlNhZWRrRm5MMkFUNmc9PQ==
>since greater core temperatures > more steam voids in coolant > less cooling > even greater core temperature > more fission reactions > >and at the same time greater core temperatures > more steam voids in moderator > less slowing down of neutrons > less probability of fission > fewer fission reactions no these two are contradictory because in a pwr water is both the coolant and the moderator first of all fuel temperature and coolantmoderator assuming pwr temperature must be considered separately fuel temperature coefficient is always negative ie hotter fuel > lower fuel density > less fission as i have explained in a pwr lower moderator density > less moderation > less fission and because water is both moderator and coolant higher coolant temp > lower moderator density > less moderation > less fission so the temperature coefficients of core materials tend to be negative also higher fuel temperature increases the probability of the neutron being absorbed by nonfissile u decreasing reactivity edit oops i see you posted the same at rchernobyl this reply was supposed to go there,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX1hQRmprZjh4X1BUYTVTekVQTFUxWGVCSmpIUTlleDFiVGlCUkpyNTlBdzlOTGZkSzA0MzJoeEt6VS1TMXFzNm15dnZka2x1MkpOTTBpbG01dkxySXc9PQ==
>less cooling > even greater core temperature > more fission reactions not quite because higher fuel temperature also has an adverse effect on reactivity with standard u fuel this is called the doppler effect it is less significant than the effect of moderator temperature but still helps you in an accident in a classic reactivity accident not taking safety measures like control rods into account you will have the following for whatever reason the reactor goes supercritical > the temperature of the water rises so its density gets lower and the moderation of neutrons is reduced + the fuel temperature rises so less neutrons are captured by u for fission > the reactivity is reduced ending the criticality event all of this happening in a few ms faster than any human operator can react this is why a pwr is a good design the reactor will exit supercritical events by itself without external interventions,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLW0tOXpTTUhMOWZKVXRpSUN0d0ZpaXh1d0MwTXdOMHo1M2t4TF8yd1FmdjJmeldyT3ZfZVhWYW9LUUN1U1d3dExiVkVHNzQ0RVhiVzRCWlYxMUFpX3c9PQ==

youre using the term supercritical incorrectly any time you raise reactor power once the reactor is brought to critical its supercritical a reactor being critical just means that net losses of neutrons are exactly made up for by the gains from fissions in a western pwr the moderator and coolant are both water as water heats up the water molecules get further from each other this causes a neutron to have to travel further before it is thermalized or moderated so more neutrons escape the core and power goes down for a short time following a refueling outage western pwrs can have a zero or positive temperature coefficient the rbmk design is much different the coolant in the channels does perform some moderation but the graphite surrounding the fuel assemblies is responsible for performing that task so as the water in the coolant channels heats up more neurons make it to the moderator and get thermalized this causes power to rise reactor power is driven by the amount of thermal neutrons available to be absorbed by the fuel,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUDduczZ0NmdiSklURGZ3N2xhRTNFbURyQld1ektLc0tyeGFnTUF5TlBseUtLUFZXcGFaV0hLSXd4NFNFNnBuVzUxMktYa2t6N0I1Tlp6YUtzZzZfemc9PQ==

you have a pretty decent understanding of the basic concepts but i think are slightly off in a few concepts to simplify im sure you dont need it but its easier to explain increased moderation increases the amount of thermalized neutrons in the core thus increasing the probably that a neutron will interact with a u atom and cause a fission so as moderation goes up so does power when a pwr begins to boil you are replacing the water good moderator with steam bad moderator this is why pwrs have a negative void coefficient because voids cause power to go down this same phenomenon also occurred at chernobyl in their water but thats had minimal effect as the graphite is their primary moderator and is unaffected by the increase in voids if anything this means more water molecules made it to the graphite rather than just getting absorbed by water also leading to an increase in power wait till you start getting into moderator temperature and fuel temperature coefficients,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSmVqQ01iUWVTaldsSlF3YjF4OHVfQlNsb216RUt6Y01mVG45X2tyZTJ6b2lnODdVajhEaWprcHYwZDNCVFRPV1VEbkVPNTFvOWxmZGs3ZHFzSmtTOWc9PQ==

you seem to be confusing the purpose of the moderator moderators slow neutrons to increase the likelihood that they interact with the core this process is what turns fast neutrons into thermal neutrons which have a larger neutron absorption cross section as youve pointed out in an rbmk the graphite moderator is unaffected by heat while the effect of the coolant water is reduced thus as heat increases so does reactivity giving you a positive void coefficient in a pwrbwr voids in the water would theoretically reduce the reactors cooling ability but voids also reduce its moderating effects this means fewer neutrons are being slowed down which means the neutrons being created spend less time in the core this reduces the probability that they interact with the core and leads to a decrease in reactor power thus pwrbwrs have a negative void coefficient of reactivity,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRFJMZ1BkeGJRa2dYT05BSzNoWUhfVnFXUHFjNG14bkFWX0pDZm5BendFY0pVclRqc0ozNUhhQkc5RFFjdHBidU9yV3ZlWlZKUmYwMU1FdWRENnlNb3c9PQ==
a better way to think about void coefficient impact on reactivity in pwrs vs the old vvers is a difference in fuel pin pitch each neutron requires an average amount of collisions ~<number><number> with the hydrogen in water to slow down to thermal speeds for reabsorption to propagate more chain reactions the pitch spacing in all us designs was tuned so that the necessary collisions on average would not happen and the neutron population naturally decreases breaking keff to <<number> and naturally lowering power levels russian fuel lattice pitch did not take advantage of this spacing orientation as the moderator escaped the voids provided enough moderator left to slow neutrons to thermal range which in turn increased neutron capture and overall reactor activity boom,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZndEZHM3WmZjQzJ0c2NwRHlVVUw3Slc4TGZUOFdJVjdzODZteDZMano5VzlzTGp3dGhCS0ZtSHZqczh6blRob0lZZEg2YUpfWEIwcl9YLWpLLU1zVkZIVV9RVm1HTXllUkFCVGxyQTRPdms9
neutrons are born with too much energy moving too fast to cause fission the purpose of the moderator is to give them something to help them bounce around in and slow down to lose that excess energy a moderator is a material that has a low neutron absorption rate without the moderator the neutrons are moving too fast they will either leak out of the core in higher amounts or they will get absorbed in other ways and not cause fission if a neutron gets absorbed by fuel and is moving too fast it likely will not cause a fission for our light water reactors the water is both a coolant and a moderator in a bwr we actually control reactor power by changing the void fraction if i raise the cooling flow rate in the core power goes up if i lower it power goes down if a reactor coolant pump trips power rapidly drops because the core voids out and it will stabilize at a lower power level where the nautral cooling of the core is equal to the power production during scram failure scenarios there are situations where we may actually uncover the core intentionally to lower power as much as possible reducing cooling down to the minimum safe level which in turn reduces power which buys time other mechanisms to scram the core or inject boron,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRzAzMW5pVl9IYVROUTNlQ1oxRTdubE5YVFJITjhQcDBZOEIyam42WS0wTnpkZnV0WkQ0LURSWGtrLWdkRDJEYzVxQlFRNG9UWEpld0JxT1lNZkFSZmc9PQ==

two important parts to consider a bwr uses water as both moderator and cooling voids are steam bubbles forming and growing the energy heat removed from waters transition from liquid to steam is significantly larger than a simple degree change so cooling is actually increased by the formation of these voids water is the moderator in a bwr moderation is the collision of neutrons fast with the water transferring kinetic energy into thermal energy heat and slowing down to a lower energy that is more likely to interact with fuel as water heats up it becomes less dense less dense moderator is less effective at moderating since there is more space between the water molecules once voids begin to form into steam bubbles a significant large increase occurs in the spacing of the water molecules reducing the likelihood of neutrons interacting and thus slowing the reaction recirculating pumps flow water through the core at a controlled rate sweeping the voids along and providing control in the rbmk design the graphite continues to moderate just as effectively regardless of the cooling water condition so the void formation doesnt slow down the reactor negative feedback the design actually has a positive feedback requiring operator action for control this positive feedback means the reactor is unstable and an increase in power causes an increase in temperature which causes an increase in power in a loop uncontrolled the coolant flash boils into a steam explosion this steam is not nuclear itself the steam explosion blew the lid off the core and ejected nuclear material from the core the overheating caused melting of materials which obviously was nuclear contamination,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOEx4RnlFT0stR2xrc2hzRjNHZ09BcmtFZjFISkVYcHZIbmVsTHNqQVpQNlJuVGVaZUVnSmhHTWJGTjVQMzJiSU9kY2p2YVp1cDlZZkRjdUNraVNnalE9PQ==

i think the magic piece of the puzzle you might be missing has to do with whats called nuclear cross sections it turns out that u doesnt like to fission with just any old neutron in fact the overall result when a neutron loves a uranium atom isnt random its determined by a number of competing phenomena like fission resonance capture absorption etc all of which can be studied by way of analyzing the cross sections ultimately what this means for u is that the uranium is much more likely to fission when the neutrons colliding with it are thermal neutrons fast neutrons can technically cause fission but its significantly rarer so if we use this knowledge to think about how we actually control reactors we can understand what is happening in a light water reactor when voids rise the most direct way to curtail a nuclear reaction is to shove some control rods usually boron or hafnium or some other poison right into the middle of things and let them soak up all the neutrons if the rods soak up the neutrons they arent around to cause fission and negative reactivity is added that part is easy but what if i dont exactly soak up the neutrons and instead i just prevent them from slowing down unlike the control rods the neutrons are still out and about but if they arent thermalizing then they arent likely to cause fission and therefore like control rods negative reactivity has been added so if i turn the water to steam and make a void theres significantly less water molecules near the fuel and therefore significantly less moderating and therefore significant negative reactivity thats basically all there is to it,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNHFtOC03NnRsWUlVeEJTR25YSFhJTDNQRURQRHFnN0pVX25yQjdnLUFqVWJMU1Bva1B6N2t2OXo0elNBaGhuN0RuTHlxeGJsbEM5SlZBcHN5OVBSTHc9PQ==

thats not really how it works though nasa does the initial researchplanning then contracts it out to us aerospace companies they are a transparent agency which means when they have problems or delays we hear about them meanwhile cnsa and roscomos are not transparent and do not ever have delays or failures unless they leak or cant be denied in this case its actually a darpa project that nasa is now a part of and the prototype may then be developed by lockheed into a spacecraft for nasa and likely a twin skunkworks project for darpa and space force,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNGxTTjAwRGRocWhXQXdfRkM3SGRPR29pU1RORmtkU2xPeVhBMF81dkZqOHNiNDBXT0RoRlhwWUVHUmx3aW44YUo1bFJLenNtY3g2TzZxZjh0QUtFN2dXRmRVMFR6TnlBaTFud0VGenloQTA9

cynical you do realize that millions of people have willingfully died in the past to make lives of next generation better so is that cynical or inspiring they way it is supposed to be nuclear is not there to kill people as you believe it is there to get cheaper energy leading to better lives of hundreds of thousands of their peers and children liquidators in chernobyl were there not because kgb had guns up their back as you see in hbo adaptation <number> of them genuinely wanted to help their country many purposefully overstay dangerous area to help just a little more they were heroes not coward bureaucrats or politics hiding behind value of single life while condemning thousands they continue to pump in fukushima not because they have to simply because they were told to mistakenly everything in fukushima is buried not in radioactive debris but in loads of politicians crap a lot of things happen to and in our minds a lot more should happen in and a lot less to it its everybody own choice rosatom continue to process is not the same as karachay lakes keep multipliyng yes they do take nuclear waste from elsewhere but it does not mean they just dumping them into random lakes that part is western media invention your opposition to nuclear power is a result of fud operations on your mind for decades most of it is just plain lie like many other things that has nothing to do with nuclear there is no quick cure but this might help <url> i like your words was seen it is pretty indicative who exactly had seen to it was their motives pure who watches the watchers nobody i am sad that you lack the thinking capacity to ponder what exactly you have been told not only by me by anyone pavlovs reflexes take over instantly good dog,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncWRoTHNRcDdJZUVEaUlYR0tPNFpaSGFVbE9QaVBKX25WMXB4VTQ2WWpjUC1kdjBqQUVyWEVOUDhtMktKZlAwa0xCOG8zQmZzNV9OcFJFbTZTZmRyMlE9PQ==

ultimately yes my station shut down in <number> most of us are still here because it takes a surprisingly long time to get the fuel out and then decommission all the nonnuclear stuff pumps and what have you then an even longer time to decommission things like ponds and reactors were looking at the first big downsizing a couple of years from now so ~<number> years after shutdown and then probably another big round ten years after that most people are looking to keep jobs in nuclear so theyre moving to other plants but some will just move to other heavy industry or aerospace or something totally different everyone over <number> is talking about early retirement many people over <number> are trying to stick it out as long as they can younger than that including me were looking to move so really only about half of the staff will move elsewhere that helps stop us from totally overwhelming other stations,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbDVhdWY2UlNyTTNwY0x6TU12MkxIMjFWNk5VOUdTMDFKTjJDc2ZWaGdlYXB5dmVxcTRDMnJFaXJOZ3k0clpsOW8wVXhqVkNkZzdaZl82TV9FdlB3aVNBWV9CU3FuTzdZYXNIekZ3b0VqZG89
the question is pretty much when can this ant reach australia with this just walking technology answer is traveling across galaxies is not possible with any current tech nor any that we consider remotely possible today much more tech tree unlocks is necessary first we do not even see what those might look like so instead of bruteforcing oceans with spoons and space with nuclear propulsion we should worry about kardashev scale first and foremost,r/nuclearpower,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZ3hVMmozbllFTnhFdUpRZ0QtWUNNVTktYTlSZTR6R3hkb3FGSkx1dUMtQ0lMTE5XZzRNNkdaY3ZVMTg5VXFwTVptcUxuNXBsb2tlZ2NNdnhTbnEzM1E9PQ==
