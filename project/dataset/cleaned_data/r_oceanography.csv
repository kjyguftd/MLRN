i work for an environmental consulting company where we have people who do marine biology work as well as gis work depending on what the workload requires in the past i worked as a marine data analyst for a marine spatial planning project where i was using gis to map ecosystembased indicators maybe marine spatial planning could be something to look into what do you mean by the physical side of marine science do you mean physical oceanography or more things like ocean floor mapping in my experience in canada ive seen more biology related positions than physical oceanography,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEeHpJRU5MZ19UMVl2cldmS1VNLXpnd1M0TXpQbW96VG40VTNaZ0RYWDJjdU50NXl0OEp2dkU1NUk2ajVhMjZfMjdzdXk2Y2QxSzJKUVkyQnNqbEVzQkE9PQ==

> if it is advanced i might not understand some things i understand that discomfort is well uncomfortable but if you listen to a video and understand everything the first time youre probably not learning very much id encourage you to switch your mindset to get used to challenging yourself whenever youre learning a new topic whether in undergrad grad school or professional life its common to encounter new and unknown things and to need to step away from your bookvideo and look up definitions or new concepts getting comfortable with that process will make you far more effective in the long run the other comment here has already mentioned scripps i would try other oceanographic centres too the uks national oceanography centre also has a podcast series<url> for example,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNESEIwVVVzRHdWTEx6YndMNkthd1BRT0RjVHJ3VmJnOWQtLWtUTDdfMElKRmlucXR0aFY0Nk9rRktiaVhHcHNjV0h4WEJOclhLaV90c1hUdzl0S1VhUXc9PQ==

so i took a geosciences data analysis class where we were introduced to python and did a group project that was helpful for an intro and since then i have been using youtube tutorials stack overflow etc to learn on my own i have found that the best way for me to learn is to come up with a project idea and then figure out how to do it in python that way the concepts stick better because youve applied them i recommend using jupyter lab for simplicity when starting out,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFN2p2aXJUVXBXRnRFaGlpeGFQeE92Zml0WjJ0MmRmR2U4MG5VTXRyWVZ3VzJackJRNmdidXlBSWZJaXZxTjJMS2FwSkItSXJxOEcwdkZGbUs4QzhDc3c9PQ==
well the user manual for the mapping toolbox is <number> pages long so you might need a more specific question personally most of the time i just make a pseudocolor plot of the gridded data it looks just like a map and is computationally cheaper if you have two properties you can do one as pcolor and one as contour and see the interaction after that id have to read the <number>page manual,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFUVJmOU11QVM3YzBRNE9MRU9pQUMtdVlWSjFqdkhnSW0wSE5HbEVjYXVOUXk0QWs3eDlxQXU2VUl5a0xISTRBUndMMW5YZGpzeDQ1MGFEU3ZjdXdhalBTSEJucWRXcnlzOUdha2d5YjFmbEk9

when youre starting to learn something like matlab or python the initial learning curve is very steep the way i learnt was by having to do things and googling to look for examples i also had the benefit of being able to ask more expert users in the <number> years since the internet has got much better examples and i still search for them when im learning to do things the things that you struggle with now will become easier with practise unfortunately that means youll find other things to be stuck on but your proficiency will rise to the point where you know you can always find the answer with a quick google,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFU2M0UW9ZWTNyS0k3QUs4Y0xwTV9jOHR6Z3RQazFZdW5Gd3BLdHdkd2VCNGl5ZXRpbW5KeWlVLVQ5TFN4TUk2WHo5OHB3b0I3RFVHRjRqMS1LNlRCaWc9PQ==

hello sorry for taking so long to get back i did not know about eddy pumping i went over the mechanism and thats most likely the reason for the profile above which is from the brazilian coast i shouldve mentioned that my bad as the paper mentions that theres a cyclonic eddy at the location that enhances upwelling i had no idea the presence of the eddy would change the way upwelling occurs so cool this really helped thank you so much i went through the stuff i was reading because i remembered a paper where stratification was given as the reason for a profile like that one such coldcore vortex is situated at the center of the cyclone track before the cyclone figure<number><url>a which is also evident through the vertical sections observation along the path figure<number><url>b shows the upwelling of isotherms at the center of the coldcore eddy and the subsidence of isotherms at the eddys peripheral but this upwelling could not reach the surface and it has been suppressed below <number> m this is due to the strong stratification in the top layers which strongly inhibits the subsurface waters to mix with surface layers from the following paper <url><url> what do they mean by upwelling cant reach the surface because of high stratification i dont really understand what stratification has got to do with the upwelling process other than changing the vertical gradients of substances is this related to the eddy please feel free to ignore this i know i ask a ton of questions,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNZWg5b1p5UVFuNzdsdlR1b3I5bE05RDJuZVQwb0RtZURkQmx3eTRVYWhQZTk1TG5HS1FEVGpscGxHQ0prcmRNYkhVUGF5TXZPTHFtbTRCMUdJdl9Ha0E9PQ==
although ive yet to read a paper based on your description my thought on this will be density if i recall this correctly stratification on the ocean occurs because of water density due to the effects of temperature and salinity in this case the theres a strong separation from the top and bottom layer as the upwelling event occurs the movement of cold water to the top side isnt able to break this layering and rather just a relatively slow diffusion process starts i usually think of internal waves when thinking about density like this example <url>,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNaldqWjJGRmlLQ1BZVkpSTVNHTnotelp0azNxMzhmZW16UEp0WVdZRkRuOFp2aWRkQXlOektueUhIMlVTbTl6S1pabFRyWFAtd0JUck1WNW4xVXRzTHc9PQ==
would that satisfy the continuity equation though you essentially have water building up with significant vertical velocities then diffusing i feel like my mental picture of upwelling is too simplistic lol ill check out the source you sent thank you,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNMnNwVXUySVgtUjFwbTNmTWJSdXNoeEtDM2pnb0wtazZkZ1NoQ3JpcjhzSlhTbjZ0WEl3amI0TTNxRXdWMHNmUDlMa0ZWTXdBWWtrQ2MweGg5bXFmYnc9PQ==

one thing ive learned since starting my phd is that every mental picture we have is too simplistic in some way that doesnt mean theyre not useful just that we should be aware of the limitations in the case of a highly stratified layer preventing further upwelling continuity is just fine in typical upwelling eventually the water reaches the surface and has to convert a vertical velocity into a horizontal one such that u = <number> theres no reason this cant happen below a layer of water instead of below a layer of air it should also be noted that while we often make the boussinesq approximation for simplicity there is a ddt term in the continuity equation as well so if an upwelled water parcel is significantly changing its density could be due to surface heating or mixing then continuity can be satisfied even if u = <number>,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNdGg0NnpEeXhodDczNTB2MExFcWpWUUc2cUtZWXIzNllVUXBoM0tUVmRDeklsNWtBMXI4aC1faFB3NS1PV2MxQ1VHVFRNUGcwLXZVWVgxRTJINkRIb2c9PQ==
my first guess would be that there is a time lag between the coast and the river further upstream and maybe the tidal bore needs so many hours of travel to trenton that it is enough for a <number> phase shift but to be honest i dont know anything substantial about the local tide on the delaware river,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNVE9GQ0k0UW9kQkZScUZGTnpGcFl2aW1reERJY3dRZGozclZPc2xVdlNrMU91Ym9aRC1hZjJPUmE3RGhZcXRBWk9wV1FybnBtVWpjcjRiTk82c005SVE9PQ==
ahh so in that case you have both the original wind driven surface divergence and subsurface divergence what transfers the signal of the surface divergence to the depths if stratification is that high once again thank you so much for helping out i really appreciate it,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNbEhNaXIxaFFpV0dvd2d6bUF3TWoyQUVQMy1mbnR4SmttOS1ZS0RwQzRfNGJqX29zbElHX2hkbGJacFZnNFhEWml0SFRRT2IyNTJFQTBtMEMwQWgwbHc9PQ==
eddies can exist entirely in the subsurface they need not reach the surface or be connected to the wind driven circulation in any way eg cuddies which spin off the california undercurrent<url> so the answer might be that there is no surface divergence signal and it doesnt reach through the surface layer,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNbG9VdjB0cXZCaXpWcnE0Y0Ztdzd2SEV3T0VzcnA2cDNCaEtDS3ZxeFRDcXItSnp1Q09COE5ubzJOdlUyeGxnenZDRzhQbk1iYTVnZUxJSDFlQWp5R1E9PQ==

yes there are tides and the signal propagates up the river at the shallow water wave speed = the square root of gravity times the average water depth so the time lag is the distance between these two points divided by this speed,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNVGJWUFZ6by1hMXFVaUR0R2ZEOF9jVUFEcWJIVHBnM08zYkpidUxaRW8wTjZ0MHVSMFM2bW1IZlptZkdzNjhmZmNQdjRsd1FfNVBRSzhkNTdING5ZX1E9PQ==

yesi think thats definitely the answer id separate it for each dataset deployment day and report a range or average mld thermocline depths i dont know your data but im a little bit surprised by the negative temperatures below the thermocline i thought that generally below the thermocline were looking at temperatures around c in the deep ocean,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOZ1VfV2ZIX3pqZ2JGOXlzSWRxdW5PZk5UbXI0NFozODZOS3luZ1Jnd0NYTF9hTlRVTmd1RXpaUlFKdnVLakFIVG9MRV9CdGdMcXppX05qbjM3emtDYlE9PQ==
oh ok that makes sense thanks for mentioning that i just used the filter function to create new datasets for each bruv deployment but im still not seeing much of a difference in terms of the output ive also tried other r codes i found online but the results im getting from those also dont make sense when i compare them to my plots while ive noticed that not many have calculated the mixed layer halocline thermocline using r is there a reliable line of code thats been brought up in literaturercommunity,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORV9NeURBNU5LVll6ZkVLMWFEZlJBaWo2N01PRUN6T25uR1FPU2pnNmd2RFBfaEtnZXpsNWwycW5hX2NtdWM0WHUxblM1WE9iSHoxMzlUdHJZWmVXYlE9PQ==
what do you mean by not much of a difference so you separated the data by day then ran the script for each day right what did the results look like then,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORjlYekpFdW5XRUJYb0hyVFAzSmViMDEyenNnY3FfengxanVLY0NZeTFOQU9naEJISVFHZVozWXFYNzBVbmZTbGlRSGxCUUhqczIxVnNvQVZzUi13TGc9PQ==
yes the data was separated by day and then the script was used to assess the depth of these layers on each day on most days though im still getting mixed layerthermoclinehalocline below m,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOM2VYaXlzSEUwMXZrOEstLWtnbTRDOG9sRW91a1FxMGFUZkJzVHladXg3aDJXSDFRSEdGYjd5SzFKZ3FOb3dPRzJPSjd0cEp2Uk1KcTJ4SDlBdklkcUE9PQ==
wait what are you trying to do overall applying the offset and scale factor could work or depending on your goal export to spss or a gis application and use outlierexclusion code to smooth the dataset just a few clicks like a delineation of the overall info etc etc,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOamhFM0FzS1EwQnh4aDRnMjNfbVlpLTJOV01BUTNKSERvbHg3dVo0MjNtRUNMVEFuU1dtSGxyYklWRmhnZFJFaEpDR3FYUngzaXA5clRmNlZPTGJQekE9PQ==
for me calculating the mld and thermocline is one of those things that seems simple until you start thinking about it most codes use a reference depth not usually the surface to get the threshold from thermocline can be trickier as there are a lot of methods theres a paper by romero et al <number> thats worth looking at,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOTnktSENQdFotVkxRNVU3bXJoc2tVZ0Qwd3p2OXo3SEFTZjdPYVNWMG9XSmNERzhKQnMtYk1aWjZBMXBmdHF4T1FjMXpYSjBPNS1mTFdtb2UzckxjNUE9PQ==
also i think one issue with your code is that you might need to sort your data by depths to make sure its in the right order for the thermoclinehalocline try using the absolute values of your gradient if your gradients are negative as would be the case if your data is arranged with increasing order with respect to depth whichmax is going to give you the wrong indexvalue i was checking the package rlakeanalyser that has a function for calculating the depth of thermocline maybe that can be useful for you,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORGlSd0MxakxjSDJ2TVhOYjkycF9lMG5zR1M1MzlHYk13R1hSemR6a1dRREJGSHVWNFNLanVYczB6TjBWRTdWQWc3eWNTOGpJWFRYZm04Vnl0T2x3T1E9PQ==

this is a great question as a poster mentioned the harmonics of tide and how phasing and the math works eventually dictate which not only includes the temporal aspect ie the note going up the river but also the harmonics and shape of the path this is a great question though and im sure there are some tools to help figure it out tide in local areas can always change though from the predominant diurnal semifinal or other setup,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPMTJWSkFIVkd3Z3Y4RWtBM3prSDJ0bXIwUFhLMHdtMmZtYloyNk04NVdpN2dvc0lyOENsRTBwNDZSdHdOSGJaTzB1UFlUWXZ4emx4RnlwaHdZNEZWMGE5YjFLeF9ycHlBWWRqcGQzdll3ajg9

for earthlike conditions fast currents would be near the western boundaries of each of the ocean basins and these would be red arrows flowing poleward in each hemisphere in the center of your map the tropics the flow would be to west left due to the trade winds your southernmost current is good,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQNVhLU3QzWWI4QUJvYXE1ejJ0TnBkS01pWE9ZUldmVnd4d1hBenF4UVBaWEpvOVQtNzZQWld1VV9KTEFOSW51UVNFTi1Bc0pKUmo5TDZQRzI3ZUdqOWc9PQ==
a thing to think about with currents is that they arent linear like the lap suggests there are shallow surface currents and there are deeper ones too in general you would see something like this superficial surface currents mostly driven by winds and tides these dont have a major role in the movement of water on the ocean scale but are super important for shipping from a fantasy world view you might want to look up trade winds and doldrums as this would affect where coastal trade cities are and how dragons migrate then you have your shallower currents generally this is warm water moving towards the poles or cool water from the poles moving towards the equator in shallower seas this might be important for shallow water kingdoms like merfolk eg in south africa where i livethe difference in a warm current on our east and cool one to the west has major impact on biodiversity so i could imagine this influencing the kinds of underwater kingdoms one might encounter lastly you have the deep currents this is when cooler saltier water sinks its usually because salt becomes concentrated in the water when ice forms so you tend to get this forming at the poles and moving outwards i think you could do something cool here eg treat the polar currents like gateways into deeper aybssal ocean kingdoms overall i think your map seems reasonable the only major change i would add is to remember that the word is round so your currents needs to extent out the sides of the map id use my advice above to rather not points of interest rather than make the map overcomplicated,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcDB0VUYxWmZsa3BTU1daQWs1dXN3SHFpazNWVHFnYWFXLXJMekpxSGZfMFZHQWZwQ25kbFRwdm5ORHVsQU1oRGNVUzhDMm40U2hZeUZfYnRzTm5Camc9PQ==
one thing in my mind is that earth has strong western boundary currents gulf stream agulhas current kuroshio current ultimately caused by the location and wind direction of the westerlies and easterlies a planet of roughly the same size and rotation would show the same behaviour to some extent independent of the continent shapes ocean currents in palaeoclimatological scenarios are probably quite close examples for what you want see this question at askscience<url> for how the currents might have looked like during the supercontinent pangaea,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQWHFtSm4wVFlUb0FlX21jcFBuYkNRbHd6dC0zdHRlMFZLSk5KVjQwN3JRZ2RMSi1xS0lfSl9ZS01sWHZBMmlVNmVTOTRUNzFxWUhKOU9TTTNuZEMtelE9PQ==
im assuming this is a cylindrical like projection so the left and right side of your map are connected right another question all your currents are surface currents right well what i would say is that in general if you have a rotating planet you will get large scale gyres basically in the ocean basins you get circular currents with the strongest currents along the western boundary this is called western intensification although this depends a bit on the depth of the ocean in the southern and northern polar oceans youd probably get a strong current going all the way around the planet from west to east like the antarctic circumpolar current,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcmNIYkJzT2o2V2NmZnluay1fMFJmdzB4RHNBcTdGZWFsR1ZCdlFKclhtS0t3WFhxeEpVaUpOQzdDSlVuX3hfajZYT3piNVhpWFJaZHBfNWtQMV83U2c9PQ==

first of all thank you for all the ideas you gave me for new civilizations and dragon migrations im probably gonna make different map layers for surface shallow deep currents also thanks for pointing out the mistake of not connecting the currents at either sides of the map major oversight,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQUVJaakxIRkZWVG16UkxqSVFKM0ZoODlmR1hRSTE1eHFYdHhxdWFETWxPZ2dlVlRraFFDOEIwOHhLVV9adUVscXdLQXFpSkR4Q3I5SEJRNlkzU0E3NEE9PQ==

yes the world itself is supposed to be a globe also for the map i posted the currents are more about the general movement of the water but since others users also pointed it out ill probably end up making different maps for deeper currents the idea of a current going all around the world is interesting storywise so thank you for that,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcUUtTVg1SkZjWktIenRZZmVtZ1VqNTMxVTdXOHl0QVBJcjUycmFOY0xOUXNDWnB2LVZxYW8zdGt0SnJpcG9oa0J4blBROTFtYWlPekhqY1o2QTZOd1E9PQ==
all good we have that same issue in the real world with a lot of the maps in school posters while were chatting ideas though also look up brine pools they are basically underwater lakes of water so salty that they dont mix with the rest of the ocean there are creepy videos of fish that accidently swim into them and are almost immediately killed by the salt difference might be a nice bit of ambiance inspiration for any deep sea settings and other really cool realworld thing to look up are the scars on sperm whales basically battle scars from their fights with giant squids in the deep ocean yes its as epic as it sounds something like that might be a nice way for information a out deep sea civilisations tod reach the surface world edit sorry im way too excited about this setting now,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQb1FMemdxWWZlLVJJM2V4X05VUTJGRS1BMU1ONEhYTEZVcTlJaHQtelU5R2JyeUlsUFlkeWhWeFc0d2tKbUEzNF9KUng0T2NwUEpyeXI5cW9WY2thckE9PQ==
the general movement is given by geostrophy the balance of wind stress and the coriolis force in basins that are restricted zonally east west this will lead to gyres unrestricted it will form a continuous current circling the planet at a fixed latitude similar to the jetstream in the atmosphere this is what i mean <url> edit maybe you can then try to connect the gyres with each other to get a more complete picture i dont think you need to map the deep currents since it wont have an impact stuff on stuff like sailing also deep water formation is complicated,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQRXJ0QUF6WnNXdHdBU2pEc3RibktMYmNRUVlrSkw0a0hwX2hOeXlJbG1GM0dLbHdnb0p2SzdUTXFhdWl4LVB1Um1veld2a00yR01VaURtMXBtT1dDX1E9PQ==
yep all i was gonna add is the idea of gyres maybe keep in mind that if the planet rotates slowly like earth there will be right hand twist to sea and air currents in the northern hemisphere and lh twist in the s hemisphere if the planet rotates more quickly that effect coriolis will be more pronounced it is why jupiter has many complex bands in its atmosphere compared to venus which really only has <number> in each hemisphere jupiter is huge and has like a <number>hr day whereas venus has a day that is almost as long as its year finally and this is useless info but a pet peeve of mine whenever i see marine snow animated in a video game or movie the flocs of stuff are going all over in every direction in reality it flows with the current and pretty much all moves uniformly,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQS0FQaklxTU4wMXFHZHI3cFE0Y1VpRTVINERjRGo0aUc1QmNtLUlJUVZJNS1FcjRVbGVac3REOWNZS052eGtkbGFaQWU2VEtmbWNOa2gtSWVfQThTeXc9PQ==

oceanography would be a great place for you you could do something related to programming autonomous oceanographic instruments that float around ocean currents and measure different oceanographic properties theres also programming related to computer simulations that we run to model what the oceans were like in the past and what they will be like in the future as the climate changes theres also stuff you could do related to satellite measurements of oceanographic properties oceanography is such a big and multidisciplinary field that people come into with all kinds of different backgrounds id start by checking out things related to physical oceanography that tends to be a very computer heavy part of the field,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR1RWUTNScDRsaV9SM0lxRFF5LUhacUFqWEhJcFJYek5ZZm5tc0JBMVp3NHk5bnU2SC1oaGlOZTEtRDFVSFFHd081MFhLdnhfZGlyRUVFSHpzeWJJLVE9PQ==

ive worked for a couple different oceanography organizationslabs and one thing everyone is looking for right now are good engineers i have a bachelors and masters in mechanical engineering but i built my masters thesis around my interests in oceanography and mainly worked with oceanography professors if you want to do oceanography and also make a liveable wage engineering is the way to go i do data analysis and publish papers so i get to do the research part as well as all the field work and sensor integration which i personally find fun if youre in the us uc san diego has a great engineering department and also scripps oceanography university of washington is also a great school that does great oceanography and has ties to noaa theres also tons of oceanography work in the great lakes region so university of michigan michigan tech university of wisconsin etc university of michigan is one of the best engineering schools in the us and has a specific degree focused on marine engineering and they also have ties to noaa,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabU96YUI2cGdGdVdiVnp2Z0dzcXB0Si03NFR3aWdMX3BJRVNST1REZGpvckVJZGxBeEhRc0kxUXVZN211M3NrTHUwUjU3MHUyOTBkWGhhNm9iUDdOT3c9PQ==

i work as a programmer for noaa that helps process ocean remote sensing data that comes from satellites like sst ssa sss etc i would recommend the same languages that umswoop said along with cc++ and some arcgis also look into handling netcdf and geotiff type files there are also some noaa utilities that are free to access that you can play around with to get familiar with geospatial data,r/oceanography,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3E5WUdhUTlBVjhpZ2FoZU81ZC1OSFJDZ3dCS0ZtTFc2TmFGTXI3SU5KdFlSMm9GZ3d4RDR4NVkzZzJqSFlFdGpaUksxTmNYenBvUEMyOU9XYU9jemc9PQ==
