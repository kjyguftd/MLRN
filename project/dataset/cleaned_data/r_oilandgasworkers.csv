out of topic but i would advise against looking forward to those companies in sg first of all shell is moving out of singapore second of all its likely the same for exxon you can read more on the layoff about sg employee reviews third rural means that youll have to travel across to jurong island where its just industrial complexs left and right you have to get into your facility by bus with the rest of the foreign workers not a bad thing just a statement the whole thing is like jail so if youre already worried about the location being rural you wont like the experience to get to work already and besides the health risk its the hours environment and working culture thats already shyte the refinery is opposite an stp and the office smells like shit the only better looking facility is their chemical plant but even then do you really want to work where its hot and humid under thick layers of ppe and consistently at risk of benzene leaks just look at their turnover rate and you can already tell its a maajor red flag,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRHI2MDgtVkY3bFg5OUt0TDRSVXBmS1MyMEJFZG5MLVYtdXM3aTNUc1I3OTNSZnlucFBLYUtSZEpseS02eGpSMFlEUUFiY1dvajk2Z2RnVUt3ald2WHZ6cTEyYUNsc195dU90SzRVTUlpQ3M9

thats good yes i would also advise to do more research on the career path youre keen on the working environments what youre good at what would make you fulfilled and the degree you have to obtain if youre going into the pharmacist route that will be a different degree which isnt related to engineering you have to get a doctorate or medical degree if im not mistaken i think you might have chemist and chemical engineering mixed up as theyre both completely different things but to fully be immersed as a fresh chem engineer being physically at site is critical for your experience regardless of industry just need alot of mental and physical grit you wont have to go out every single day to the field and turn valves so youre less likely to be exposed to benzene compared to the operators this could be relative to different companies but to be in exxon theres always something every single day and note that when anything happens at site at am on saturday morning you have to be there because you have to answer to your business team on the process unit you monitor the fb semicon textile could be a more relaxed industry but im not too sure thats the vibe im getting from my ex colleagues and batch mates,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad3puck5nZzJUcFFLUTI5bmQ4aUNCbVNLaG9LdmI1S3B0VkY5bHAzQ1NxOUFqZUtXUGZqSVh4VExtZ2duQnBmV004aU1kLTJCSDE3MHI2N280R1BTdjVkbTRKOU9pR0VacU8tUFpzX19VYzg9

theres a longterm fight between citizens and local administration in my area due to the pollution brought by the many refineries we have but the cancer rate in the area isnt much bigher than the average rate in the whole country for sure years back they used to release everything in the atmosphere all remaining cargo during ship operations was drained into the sea and there was completely no control about the pullution meaning that for sure a lot of people could get cancer especially if they used to bath in the products while working each country has its own regulations to control the pollution but more or less all of us are on the safe side of the job if we compare to the previous decades even <number> years ago it was far worse than now you can consider that almost all oil movements are closed in the pipelines for both safety and economical reasons therefore your exposure is limited to really small quantities of dangerous chemicals as somebody said in the replies it depends a lot on the plant youll work in for sure working in the laboratory for chemical analysis is far worse than working at the jetty its obvious to say that not working at all with refined products and chemicals is better than working with them each of us has a body which may respond in different ways to the exposure but right now working in the field is pretty much safe,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUE14SUl2bVJMV3ZNRER4QnlEUDlvejZITWhLLUVwTVJaZ3N3b1g2ZVBtRjNycDdGbFQzQ01LMi1rMHFnYVpieTlmYkVZczVjLWg5b3JGWTJRemlldnc9PQ==

while drilling into an oil sand or area of interest you may see an increase in gas entrained in the drilling fluid but theres no geyser of crude oil raining down like in the movies the gas is controlled as it reaches the surface its fairly anticlimatic when the well is drilled to depth you typically dont really know if the well drilled is a good well until logging is completed when the logging has determined they hit a reservoir its a good feeling to know the work was beneficial and not in vain its particularly good when its a new field or a major discovery for me a good well means the company and their partners can leverage the discovery into drilling for more discoveries more discoveries means more contracts and more work if all they drill is dry holes eventually theyll slow down or stop drilling,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV2UyaS0xdjdQc1RyOWRfR2s1VDktMHVaZnl0ZUM1N3lMYWgxMzhIMV80WGtkM3VOWGt6a1I1amdCVlM5WjZnX0xhOTA4MDF2bEFLaHRDdjVnUGdfOTFMWDBZbWZaS0NhazBQZ3NqUXcxZWs9

they do they get to keep their jobs im assuming youre not in the industry due to the types of questions youve asked in this thread and thats okay were happy to share information i think the biggest thing you dont know is that a driller is not responsible for finding oil or gas they are following directions somewhere up the chain a reservoir engineer a geologist and a completions engineer have gotten to gather and looked at all kinds of scans old data surveys and logs and decided that there is a pocket of oil in a certain place at a certain depth then they decide where to drill what direction what depth and how far and that information is given to a driller and he follows those directions and even then theres not necessarily oil flowing out of the ground we dont want that so its not like in an old movie where they are drilling and oil is blowing out the top of some wooden drilling apparatus,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZnhUR0NfUjh2Zldsc185MEVlMDRreVZHRERHUlJLQkRoOWlySUNfT2dycmx1eWtqOXBja0ZEZy1uSW9lclYzR0FoUUx1eE40aWJNZGNhemp6SWdkM0E9PQ==

ive been on rigs drilling wildcat exploration wells and it gets pretty exciting everyone is trying to play it cool but there is a real buzz that grows and grows and the well goes deeper the wirle samples come up etc its not an ah ha moment but there is real thrill to it you can feel it on the rig,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZHRxUzEtVW9JRUg1T3JpUk5EWk12YTVxd0VKRXBBaEhoU2ItT0dLSW8yNWFVdmVuRWk3c3RkRWJOR2xqTWNnZEEwYTlBZl9EYjRGQm83WU13M1E0OHc9PQ==
depends what you mean by find oil in the context of exploration its pretty rare for a new well to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and go on to be developed like <number><number> to <number><number> for true wildcat exploration drilling with you working directly on the well for the operating company its only happened to me once in my <number>+ year career corrib gas field west of ireland and ive been involved in a lot of exploration well drilling outside of that many wildcat wells find oil or gas or both but turn out non commercial basically the producible volumes ended up too small to be profitable to produce thus they were never developed ive been involved in a bunch of those exciting at the time but ultimately frustrating ive drilled a lot of appraisal and development wells but there the oil has already been found and we are delineating or producing the oil which while exciting is not quite the same thing some people get lucky though the guys at exxon working guyana stabroek block have racked up <number>+ deepwater commercial discoveries totalling over billion barrels recoverablr in the last <number> years easily the most prolific deepwater wildcat play of the last decade or so my company is non op partners with them and weve basked in that success also but its still not quite the same as when you as the operator drilling or subsurface team are responsible for the prospect and well that makes the discovery,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYnR3aHFvSnU0Y3hpU2Q2YjlIWllNdldLaE1adTY3azZHc01NQVYzX1M0YTFiTUxEekhkWmRObnZvNjk3aTJMbHZGdi1zbXVSRk9kQ0ViTFJMLWlFMTBqQmxFVzByRExhLWlrSVJJOEpkTGM9

ummm no oil and gas exploration and production is full of technical and commercial risk and uncertainty and ehs risk if were not careful our picture of what lies thousands of feet below ground and what can be extracted to surface processed and sold is incredibly fuzzy heres one highly uncertain parameter from a commercial point of view its probably the most important parameter in assessing the profitability of an oil development future oil prices do you know what the brent or wti oil price is out to <number><number> years in the future if you do never mind e p go and play the commodity markets youll be the richest man the world has ever known,r/oilandgasworkers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTHo0cnE2cGZYNnpVMUpPUFZsWkNQSzN5aDV0Um9aaUktUmJDYXdmbV9xNGxPUFZ4MEVYSWVtdFpDcnZ5WFliU1pUNWhIeThwMUhBVkpoeXQybHQyRzd2Ml8zeEtUWW84NGZOX3JPVW4zeXc9
