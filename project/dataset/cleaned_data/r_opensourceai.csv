from my perspective as someone who doesnt code the current learning curve for using aws to train a custom llm on new data is too steep for me to bother with right now formatting the data isnt an issue its trying to figure out what the training steps are after that and trying not to get dinged for accidentally using compute after one has given up on it and getting a bill any open source project which made the process more like using a word processor or spreadsheet with non technical instructions would be <number> opening up a huge pandoras box which perhaps should remain locked for now <number> inundated with new users with ideas and a lack of coding expertise,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSRmlFa2syWnhzc3J3Ri1hMk5PWkpRLWJwMEV3a0hwWjE2eEVHT0JURU14VmNPd0xTTUxsandMS2FtQlBqaGNISkJsX2lEblJ2bFQ1RldLamRja0dCUWc9PQ==

its been awhile since i skimmed the info on this llm if i recall correctly there wasnt enough arabic language text for full training so they substituted code to make up for that lack so any fine tuning would likely be done with english i suspect,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQVZEV2hWTzNTQlBDOWwzd1VnUmVHVXVDbjZXT2hpTFV2cXNqdll6U1d2eG1faU5zMFhydXY3QzNBSjJ0YUJjVDBoZFlZQldxMHZfa0NkRjB2Um5EOFE9PQ==
i tried the latest version publised a month ago i think its super cool with arabic text so i think they modified it but i want to finetune it on arabic tasks like extracting answers from texts do you think if i finetuned it using english dataset it will be able to do it as well in arabic,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSM1l4cWcxcmh0eEREUERtZXdnOTVBakFOSHJ1czRlSENhSnVKNlhadmZySE1MVksyZDByS2E2UmRmV2pmMV9vLTJJOG95bjBtWkRsaHp2bXlmTHpLRlE9PQ==
im just making a guess here but if you are able to give it at least some high quality new training examples of the type of answer extraction youre looking for in arabic as well as fine tuning with an english data set that may be your best bet fine tuning just with english might improve it somewhat but a combination would likely give it more nuance,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMUVZV000ZlhrUUFtYTdsVF8yQ09PcGpzMGMxeHU0SGk1UzVhbGZHY1hTdUozZE9ad0NGTWFxUmFtMGpBM2NOS1ZrRmtJNnI1TzQ0V0QtdldrMnBTVGc9PQ==
id say reaching out to the inceptionai team with feedback or ideas to collaborate with them on might be the best bet the model seems to have been well thought out so it might not be particularly easy to improve without working with them to get specific ideas on fine tuning for your use case a long blog post about the model is here and they do seem interested in collaborating <url>,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSa2tQZzhQNXZCenY1Z3VJQUtzSlpRN252a3dBWGlKclczSEVHTkwyMEk3SmNSNVJ3eC1KVXNRUXY3c1RiSjVTRDRNLUVxSkJkV25ZSkw0cnl4VlpnQnc9PQ==

most tools like pictory invideo zebracat etc rely often on many rd party services and apis which are still quite costly at this point in that sense its not just video but also audio script generation voice over i think thats why there is not one open source solution available yet as far as i know,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTamdKSGIxREk3OEtrWWV5TTJIS3pvTXU3LXRVMXUxTmpaeXIwNTFOVmNxM0x0WC15U2lqOGQzNVZWR0Z0eVVXel9mb0MwN3BBSWsxemFOWFBUczQtdlE9PQ==

kialo<url> is a a site for open debate with argument trees rather than long linear unstructured comment threads repetitive hard to oversee not suited for complex subjects not including functionality for rating argument weight etc i just find it interesting and am a user of the site where theres many ongoing airelated debates they go on for years in contrast to what i call fast social media join the public debate or read up on arguments in the debate which is also useful for closing knowledgedata gaps etc if you have an argument and dont find it there but dont want to add it you could also make it here and ill see if i add some claim about it,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWDhGUWlWNWdnaFpFVWJqWV83eGYzVG5QTjZKWEJSLW1XS3oxcnpKZml0RkN1cm1sMk13cUlyenJXb3hDMy0wLUlPQjlFUVdtTjQ1eldiQ2RQTHJfb28zdDVzb29MeHBtLUtCQThGMnFlTlU9

i have done this using stable diffusion with control net there are a number of tutorials how trying looking on rstablediffusion let me know if you have trouble maybe i can point you in the right direction but theres maybe <number><number> minutes of initial setup work and the rest is getting the prompting and control net to work correctly together,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNWQtVVFlU05UbWFYRGtSZ2NaMEpHUVRyRWlYLUdybkQ2T1JVMnVhWm5wMnNpb3JrdjQ3bEJvNXNUcXRnRHMtcTFqOGVQcks2YUd6ZEtnTEs0dHJfNHc9PQ==
i personally say no keeping ai closed source only fuels speculation that it is manipulated and biased based upon a political agenda before someone starts preaching one side or the other it doesnt matter any derivative political agenda is bad no matter what software should always be free of politics im a firm believer that open source paves the way to ensure that software is indeed free and nonpolitical in every way possible because it can be inspected and analyzed at any given point i also firmly believe that open source offers the best opportunities for innovation i have been a programmer for <number> years and equally involved in open source for just as long and am an avid supporter of open source software,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWGJWUDRqRWttX3pBcUM1NktrUTI2MnFxXzBXaUVDb0pKV08xWWRvTmJvVjMzRTVlOW1FNWplSnFuclhVNUJleXZkR3BmQXBUNG5jTXFuQWJyeElSemc9PQ==

interesting thanks for your input mind adding these three arguments to the structured debate i think the first one could be a pro underneath a broader argument about this being useful to mitigate bias manipulation political distortions i think the other two are already included but maybe you could add to them,r/opensourceai,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTanFoakFYc3c1TDFHWU9NLTczX1dJZmhSWDFJN3ZuTGpSczdjdjdWblA1TGE1bmxCeHZpOEdLejRtcTRUTDBJbjZ2djFIcG9vckFMV0ZHVFRJLVVyRnBpdi01N3B4MDlVY1FJLVc5QUludmc9
