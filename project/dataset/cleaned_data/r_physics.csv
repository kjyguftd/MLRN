yeah if you can follow this video series by frederic schuller <url> basically mathematics for graduate level physics you should be good for the more advanced topics i am guessing this will be too difficult so recommend mastering the foundations and work your way up to understanding,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNngxbFpiZmJtMDZnZFZZckRzRzFjQ1Nua2d6WkE3U0lmck0zYjdubEhVeUJpd1NJNHFjNkZNdl91ZXlITEJDTWxZNFdjbmlUVmx5WmMtdmZQQWlBTnc9PQ==

if my post came off differently than it was advertised i apologize you are completely right i am unqualified i even said it in my post that i know i dont know please dont take it too seriously i am talking about the bee movie to try and get my point across i dont expect to discover the undiscovered but i would like to learn more than i do about it and the first step to learning is admitting you dont know everything i only wanted to share something i was thinking of and by giving my perspectiveunderstanding of what was going on i was excited to learn where i my thoughts were flawed i said propose but thats just me saying here is what i think i even said it in the post i know i dont know and i want to learn i think its dumb that you are trying to limit the message in my post because i am asking a question that being where am i wrong and i have learned its been proven that this space matter aether isnt a thing i dont mean any offense to the community i am simply here to potentially gain help understanding why i am wrong so i can understand better,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYczJBWXdsVDYtVDQyNFRuZjhrbWdHTFpNV3FkakZXWlNIWTVsMDEwakRGZ0IzeGhtV3JVZm1TekNPcFBfT3ItQl9xWDJKMS1GNnZhaEtmZnBlaXRUTV9xWUhoVmNrLXRsSnc3ajBqU1dJeU09

hey my field the multivaluedness of the polarization has direct implications when trying to predict the properties of materials like ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics ie materials which are valued for their electric polarization to make a long story short if you do a single shot calculation of the polarization what you find is that you can actually get different values for its magnitude depending on your definition of the unit cell if polarization is an intrinsic property of the system this should not be the case this was resolved via the modern theory of polarization which basically says we must consider changes in polarization as such when we compute the polarization of a ferroelectric material such as with dft we must actually compute the polarization of the structure of interest as well as the polarization of a reference phase that is connected to it and the polarization of each structure along the path connecting the two structures by taking the difference we can then ensure we have the correct value for the polarization if you do not do this you can dramatically overestimate the polarization of your material see figure <number> of a beginners guide to the modern theory of polarization by nicola spaldin for an example although the whole thing is worth reading a full treatment as stated by uzerozeroa is given in the papers by resta,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSVNuamhyRFZONmZ4dGdSUHY2YUQ4bFR3WVRoUXBtRENxa3JCUnZqVTFReUFDWFFTT0FsTm1zei1SaWVGRy1NcFRXSkFZUFQyNy15UU1mVFVhRnlVSXc9PQ==
the problem is its not really possible to explain where youre wrong youre pretty much wrong everywhere the whole thing is wrong this isnt going to be an effective learning procedure i want to repeat this because youre making a common mistake so common that this is the second time ive had this conversation with someone on this sub in two days dont try proposing new ideas your proposals are going to be so far off the mark that it will be impossible to guide you from them to a solid understanding of things thats not the way to learn ask questions about things that confuse you,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYN0N2NlNlc1pEcFNNVW5RNmlIaGxvSzRhM2hKVHBrMERPMXd0NmppeFZ1MWhPYjZ5aUtmQ1Z2RTlYSFV0Q3FhalQxcWxMeHJpYllvOURxSHJTSHpjclE9PQ==
i understand what youre saying i am really glad you said what you did you are right there is a lot wrong here and its broad its just that i really didnt know any other way to express my question what do you do when you have a question that really important to you that you can even find a way to correctly ask,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYnNkSllkUFczYkdpWlhoYmcxcGZtaWVSTnVBTHB0R0x6OGdXLU52QkcydzY5Zng2ZjRPa1AweHo0NVhqejhJTnlzWFFORGNzTW5xb0YxMjMwN2VLZk9RNUpYaXozcWtvSjhLNlJCNWIxNkE9

learning to ask good questions is a powerful and useful skill the thing i would suggest as a starting place is to you know try whats wrong with something like i have heard people talk about the fabric of spacetime what does that really mean what is it made out of how does it behave,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdXl2Z1M4Z0xubFZSSWk3VmJWSGR3RzlBTnF4OHA3RWlob21IY0ZBQlVPLXVWMnFwSFZnNnhXRFdRSnpBUFFtNHJzdE5XZ3R4d1RJbnNDVGJhczNqS0E9PQ==
im not sure what exist means in this context space exists in the same sense that the distance between paris and london exists note that that distance isnt very well defined right i might have meant the distance along the surface of the earth or i might be asking for a straight line that goes through the earth space in a physics theory exists in the same sense we have an agreed upon definition of what the distance between two points is and if we use that definition other physicists will understand what we mean notably that definition has evolved over time as it became necessary to incorporate things like inflation and specialgeneral relativity but in the end its just a way of describing where things are in relation to each other,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQkdXZ1VEaEhpN2RNZFFKLXVUR0dFV2pJRWF3NG1SeFZWTUxIOXNWNjB4NUNNSlkzQ19IdHZMMGRfOFJUcHh3ZTZ4ZzJUNm82SnJBaGVyOExhQ3JyNWdhNHBER05HemJjRU5Ha0I4V0RTakk9

wonderful to see enthusiasm of this scale but he would have been better served by reading up on what we currently know about light and time and why we know that frenchs special relativity might be findable as a pdf but certainly is a great introduction to relativity which would correct many of his false ideas,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ0x3b1J5c2M1X002cGVEdzloYjNVTjBGNkJZQWxtV0JKWXNGdlY0UC1uUjlyMXR4UEFKcmlrbEtJbG42YjB3Z3A5TGpZZWFnelRwVzFPQjBlTnYzaVE9PQ==
i think its dope that your old man has taken an interest in physics im a lifelong lover of space myself i think the kindest thing i can say is that i think he would benefit greatly from a literature review many smart people have thought about this stuff for a long time and all good hypotheses are improved through testing their explanatory power in contrast to other frameworks towards the end he expressed a desire for nonmathematical critique unfortunately to really plumb the depths of other frameworks at least some mathematical reasoning is extremely useful if not required he seems to brush up against the theory of relativity which is wonderful to see in a layperson much ink has been spilled on special and general relativity so it shouldnt be hard to find a book at a library that can meet him where hes at do keep us updated i applaud his passion and the guts it takes to put your own ideas out there cheers,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTlFnR3BCRHdnaGx4WTl0WktmN0xLdkozczQ1akxtX2J6UnNpZDRmdmF3WndLb0JKc2phajJqMHVwQzdQTWROZ0xkWWZhT1hWVlgzeXhFNXFGUWxxYVE9PQ==

as others have said unfortunately it will be difficult to get all but a very superficial understanding of string theory without math the way we typically interact with physical theories is through mathematical structures in practice the mathematical structure is the theory this is obviously a somewhat unfortunately high bar,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcS12MXpwUmIwdlpIZFF4MEtqbGZfRDZpa2FSSWQ3R0JPdTdJdHdSQU1za0o5T0lxUzVwejZlSUt2dzM2UmdIaTRiRW14cG1idm1ObDZnOHR5a2tweEE9PQ==

youre pretty close >a time crystal is a crystal whose structure naturally oscillates over time for the definition used by these authors that is basically correct it is some system that has spontaneous and selfsustaining oscillations the oscillations dont have to be in the physical structure though they could be any macroscopic observable such as a density or a magnetization or a charge dipole note that with this definition there is not necessarily anything that exotic or quantum about it there are classical nonlinear systems that can show various kinds of selforganizing and spontaneous oscillatory behavior,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNU05NFp5aTJ6bHdaM3RkN251UExhNG93OXhhSXpWTFdibnBCV2NVdjdDTnBFZ3p6TnhIZXlvMko2UmxiUzFNRTBiTnlKbk9GcXRlUndubzJzME5BNlE9PQ==

sorry of this is imprecise i dont think i completly get what you mean the model of partial pressures basically comes into play when you have mixtures when a vapour is mixed in an atmosphere it will have less interactions with itself and other compenents and you can model this by considering its partial pressure the liquid can be considered uniform and to not dissolve gasses so it behaves like a unique separate bodysystem which is subject to the total pressure if you had a closed system containing only the liquid and its vapour partial pressure would be equal to total pressure,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVGduNzlKUzlpSGVGTXFITXNMLXRUNDhSZGNMRDlVRk1aWTIyd0ZldHBfY21QQ0NlNWRFb2wyeWpZWlIwN2I3SE9rZWtKX09GMTkxeG53UjBqNmVKOHc9PQ==

ok i got that this clump of small balls still loosely connected to their nuclei are synchronously moved up and down i can accept that those small balls have an aura that we call electromagnetic field this sort of halo around them has an inertia so when this bunch of balls moves up and down it follows them lagging a bit behind and so forming some wrinkles waves now since those balls are ultramicro i expect this halo to barely exit the diameter of the antenna but i can be generous and imagine that this antenna has a resulting halo like half a meter around it but then thats it though instead it seems that this wrinkable halo is not a sphere around those electrons but a jelly omnipresent in the universe so the wrinkles propagate through this jelly until reaching the voyager it still baffles me that waves created agitating a <number> meters antenna can reach that far without being dispersed in the fabric of this jelly itself,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU3h6YkZRODJIZEE2bm9odEJOSDI1VGlTeDZrU2VGVVRKbzFoUWdhci1MRlRhVV9xejVDelFqX0hKeEZFV0dsUDd1Q3NNNVBWZGpUR0hCVXh1UWtoc3c9PQ==
if i understand you correctly you essentially want a dynamo on the wheels of the rollerblades to generate electricity any dynamo will add resistance so the base situation is the humanoid robot without the energy generation that is your minimum energy expenditure then you add a dynamo which adds resistance and increases the power needed to keep the movement at a constant speed the dynamo will be able to recuperate a large part of that extra energy spent but youre not getting the base energy back the only tiny advantage that you could have is through regenerative braking when you come to a standstill you usually just lose the kinetic energy to friction a part of that could be recovered through the dynamo however it seems unlikely the added weight and friction of the dynamo would cost more energy than you can get out of the system electric cars get around that by using the electric motor they need for propulsion anyways as a generator when braking otherwise it might not be worth it either,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVmJ3X3dWWjdKV3ZNYnJqd1ZGa1FBdTY5YkdDX2xfTTdVNGtYM1Rrd1Vic3B5dU1WZFJ1US10QWltY2dYcHJkakprWks4eHFGWF80b1Q0b0tFQWtOMnc9PQ==

yes but why does the atmospheric pressure not influence the pressure of vapor can it move freely in the space and when the vapor condenses it has immediately <number> bar pressure why does this not work against the principle of least compulsion,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYazVGMG1yOXBKOUZEZGpiRTFFcUlPWlBxLWpSdmJRMDlrb1BkVU15MUNKUDA1Ty12U3FwUkZDR2FTV1d6cEc1bHBWWHZ4UmpiZVFQVVd6eU8zcTRhUWc9PQ==
the atmospheric pressure does influence the partial pressure of vapour the sum of all partial pressures is the total pressure the atmosphere is considered as one homogenous gasvapour its all just a model to understand how the mixture that is the atmosphere behaves by splitting it in its components and studying the behaviour of the singular component when the vapour condenses it separates from the atmosphere and becomes a single component bodysystem which is subject to the total pressure of the system in thermodinamics you consider fluid as continuos not formed by discrete particles but again this is all a model in reality all particles are subjected to total pressure but studying such problems particle by particle is impractical lets say if you want to model gasvapour behaviour for inhomogenous fluid you can but you need complex differential equations i either dont understand what the principle of least compulsion is or i dont see how it applies,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYa3ctREpWN01ZWmJ0QzlRRmVjdnFUREJuQlNjcW81UXBmdDNFTnlkVUJuaS13LVo2VjZLMlJsaDR6QW5hWkVvSE5CMzFGLTFOdVVxRkFpS3RYRGJjeGc9PQ==

for how i understand it you have to think about this also on the particle level for this the difference between a liquid and a gas is the kind of bonds the molecules can form with eachother bonds are broken by reciving energy thats why if you heat up a liquid it can evaporate and does so gradually thogh its not like each particle detaches from the liquid and then is forever gas at the interface there is a continous back and forth of particles latching and detatching but if the total energy of the system is fixed the total number of particled as vapour and as liquid will be rougly constant since the number of particles is enormous its very unlikely that fluctuations would be perceptible what happens is that the gas starts interacting with the liquid and starts to knock out bonds but at a certain point there will be particles of the fluid in vapour form that start interacting with the liquid and reforming some bonds the situation moves until equilibrium is reached and you have the same number of molecules forming bonds and breaking bonds pressure in general acts like a force pushing all the particles closer together making creating bonds easier thats why evaporation point changes with temperature but also decreases the amount of vapour in the air because it pushes the back and forth at interface towards creating more bonds in all of this partial pressure is just a concise way of expressing concentration and pressure in a single term since those are the factors at a certain temperature that influence the equilibrium point edit pressure ov vapour is the pressure for which there is equilibrium at a certain temperature i incorauge you to finde more answers though as i am not exactly an expert and i might be qrong on some points,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZczIxV2ZRT3JySjJpNVRqSkN2SHVJSGR2bGxzVi03OGFDVHgtLURXT1BxRC1zVFhWanFBSVpyT1JRQXNOOUpPcFA4QkdRT05ySlZUM0pCZ0FOdFVCcmc9PQ==

ok thank you to summarize increasing vapor content in the air increases pressure which is obvious equilibrium of vapor content is reached at <number> mbar in our example however the vapor also has approx <number> bar pressure the ideal gas model just describes that the amount of vapor in the air can be estimated from daltons law and no partial pressure shifts due to influences of other gases have to be considered to go one step further if there is a watersalt mixture in an evacuated enclosure with <number> air in it the mixture will boil at <number> c assumption to allow for an easier discussion of pressure in the system then the final pressure will be <number> bar vle for water + <number> for the remaining air content so the mass fraction of the remaining water resembles the vle of the mixture at one bar but the pressure measurement is wrong am i right in this assumption moreover there is no boiling when water evaporates below its vapor pressure as density changes occur at the surface only when the pressure of the liquid is the same as in the gas above the liquid it starts to boil as density changes in all of the liquid,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM0oyY19IV19rRnBlQ2h5VEY3bGU0cEJxUFVYc0hmS1lJVjVkM3huTFF6ZWlRZUM5UE16YmtFSGxwdGhvQW5EbzBlaWloT1JQeVVEWGluODdVamtkNEE9PQ==

i think what makes this hard to visualize is that we cant sense the electric field in daily life yes the electric field is omnipresent and represents the sum of all the electrically charged particles in the universe in terms of the power and how those waves propagate so far there are a few points to consider <number> theres no energy loss due to the medium if a travelling wave goes down a rope the energy dissipates the further it goes due to losses in the material however the electric field doesnt resist change in any way so theres nothing to stop a wave getting from one end of the universe to the other <number> em waves are a far field effect where the wave is far enough from other sources of reflection absorption and interference that it can be described in a simple way the near field effects are much more complex as the changes in the electric field interact with even the radio electronic components local pieces of metal etc its like how the sound at a concert can be a mess due to all the echoes but if youre hearing it from across town the sound is a simple waveform travelling through the air <number> because the changes in the electric field propagate in all spatial directions you can imagine a spherical surface increasing in radius outward at the speed of light the boundary of how far those changes to the field have travelled energy was put in initially to accelerate the particles at the source and the field propagates electrical energy from that to go potentially affect other particles the total initial energy is contained within the surface of a sphere if youre far away you can only interact with a small portion of that sphere so you can only receive a fraction of the initial energy this is the inverse square law where the available power decreases in proportion to the square of the distance from the source all in all the answer is that you need a very large amount of power to create a signal that can be received from far away eg a broadcasting station and the signal received is amplified by the electronics of the receiver,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRC1VR21yOGE3aUd4SE1HVkhKWElWSDNYT1lZblVWaFc1X0pjWEY3Z1VYaW5wU25ramhXREpLVDE0bGlEUnQ5MnVlTWJ5MkY0QWI5b3pydTJGdm1BTXc9PQ==

oh absolutely i agree with what youre saying and therein also lies the controversy on the surface it seems like a simple problem with the treadmill going fast enough so the plane cant move is a very large series of assumptions and conveniences and if treated at this surface level then the answer is an obvious no the problem lies in constructing a scenario where this happens and whether youre moving from the hypothetical into the real world some people treat the problem in the hypothetical others in the real the two different scenarios have vastly differing outcomes depending on which reality youre working with,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQm1YSXk5SktnZ2ZPUW10YTMyVFh0ellKN0lXWFNTTTVlZVlybzh3dDdBWmsxTjJ5RlNqc095dzctYWpHcG9wX2FpZnYxOXllenNpbVlpMHk4a3hhcFE9PQ==

quantum mechanics is the best theory we have to understand the fundamental workings of the component objects of our universe if you ask any question about matter and then ask enough followup questions it will eventually lead back to quantum mechanics for practical purposes many humanscale engineering questions do not need to resort to quantum mechanics to be sufficiently accurate to work well enough and it is often not possible to use quantum mechanics directly to do calculations about human scale physics along with the applications that other have mentioned quantum computing is a fascinating active area of research and nanotechnology is fundamentally quantum and potentially revolutionary we need quantum mechanics to understand star formation neutron star composition the cosmic microwave background radiation black hole evaporation possibly worm holes possibly black hole singularities and many other large scale phenomena we see when we look out into space,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaTZEdmZEcG5WdE1BR2xwY1otRmdIOWhjNzdEMGIxR2QwdlJ6eXp1dzcxMkFHV0d2ekw5Q0hZa1RIY0xQVThQb2YtTmVMVkRPNUtudFpwRlVHblhYeVE9PQ==

it is a interesting question and can be answered several different ways and point out a lot of things like atomic clocks rydberg radios there are lots of semiconductor devices examples where quantum mechanics is helpful or needed to understand them in terms of manufacturing semiconductor devices many transitors hemts leds and lasers use quantum wells quantum wells are thin layer of materials can be manufactured across a <number> mm or even larger diameter wafers but if you are thinking about where can quantum mechanics be important for large man made objects you might consider the ligo interferometer one of the reasons it is so sensitive is that a technique know as quantum squeezing is used to reduce the noise that system is very large kilometers in scale if that is considered cheating one can look around and find examples where mechanical resonators are cooled down to very low temperatures and they are limited by quantum noise and you have small but bulk objects that behave quantum mechanically in the area of sensors i think there is a lot of interest in improving magnetometers and gravity measuring instruments using quantum mechanics as well some people will talk about quantum <number> where the first generation of quantum was for things like lasers and the second generation is for devices like quantum computers where entanglement is needed,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV3FoNmd6d0pyUVkycFBBS2dtdmRJMkx0bDJkc2RMbFZFUUhxWExyZ1RjNW1acWFTTXhrX2ZaREFTQ1FiN1ZMVVU5bDYtaGduM1N1Nzc5OEJYVlNnWm0tdVV0c1ZMVTZYQTlzYVZWNXdfNUk9

in most everyday situations if youre dealing with macroscopic objects you can get away with classical physics for example for modelling the air in your room at k the classical and quantum ideal gas model are virtually indistinguishable so you could say that you dont need qm however there are some interesting exceptions to this <number> the two classical examples that lead to the development of qm blackbody radiation it results in the uv catastrophe if treated classically and the photoelectric effect for which einstein won his nobel prize <number> all macroscopic forms of magnetism can only be explained with qm there is a theorem<url> that proves that matter at finite temperature cannot be magnetized at a macroscopic scale in a purely classical model <number> charge carriers in metals behave like an ideal quantum fermi gas rather than a classical ideal gas this means that there are macroscopic properties of metals like heat and electrical conductance that are measurably different from what a classical model would predict you can read more about this here<url> <number> related the theory of electronic band structures<url> which is our current understanding for why some materials are conductors insulators semiconductors etc is based on qm <number> superconductivity and superfluidity can both only be explained using qm although you probably dont encounter them in normal conditions at least yet they are still quantum phenomena manifesting on a macroscopic scale <number> of course our modern understanding of nuclear physics is quantum which is important for some macroscopic phenomena like nuclear reactors and weapons and how stars burn im sure there are more but those are the ones i can think of off the top of my head a rule of thumb is that its fine to treat things classically if the thermal energy kt where k is the boltzmann constant and t is temperature in kelvin is much larger than some natural unit of energy in the system for example for blackbody radiation the classical model breaks down for very energetic em waves which is in the uv range similarly for charge carriers in metals the ideal fermi gas has a natural energy scale called the fermi energy for metals one can estimate the fermi energy and it turns out to be much higher than the thermal energy at room temperature in fact it is higher than the melting point of most metals which is why one must use qm to describe them,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeHBjQUdIYVZCS2N4SnNvR0UtUkZsUXI3dGtXbTdnb1luSGpiOFdiTVVocVFrTWxlS0VHb0pGd2F1NGJXTmF4eXRjallKX1Rid3c1NnBscE4tMm9ZRnE0TXJOYmlHMWdMNW03aldYd2dsWlU9

heres one that i remember from undergrad that most of the class got wrong you have a box filled with an electron gas now you remove a wall of the box to allow the gas to expand to twice its initial volume ie it undergoes a free expansion given that the box is perfectly thermally isolated does the temperature of the gas increase decrease or stay the same >the temperature goes up since electrons repel each other their potential energy is higher if they are closer together when the gas expands the typical distance between electrons increases so their average potential energy goes down as the system is isolated total energy is fixed so their kinetic energy must go up so temperature increases<,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbm1GbEMzS1R1MXJhWUpJLUtfQXJJUGRMV1BHV3F1eU1Ea2tIS3paVjU2emdFY2JYTmlmdVg3TXBDcG1TTjE2NnZWdVdiWnlXbjFDMElBOUNMVVN4TUZNX3BRc1FRZVdhWHJaSlpqNjBrTkk9

well this may get deleted here but i have a masters degree in high energy physics from the university of chicago ive studied physics for many years including general relativity and quantum field theory but i got very disillusioned by string theory mainly because although physicists have been studying it now for about <number> years it still isnt science in my opinion because it fails to make any testable predictions right now i think physicists are better off studying areas of physics that are currently testable like coming up with new theories to explain experimentally verified deviations from the standard model or coming up with new models for the universe or multiverse based on cmb data or quantum entanglement results,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUG1ZWUt1eWhFeHVDVVUyVDliRGFtWjc2WWw1TWtNdFpHZ28ybFAtcE5TU1MzZmhUWnRVMHJVU3pabVc4aXdRLUMxR3BaaXZkY0tHdXhBX2Z0TVNvNXc9PQ==

even biology is fundamentally quantum mechanical if you want to get an accurate model of photosynthesis you need to consider electronic transfer at the quantum level single ligand binding is also quantum mechanical in nature and you would ideally use quantum mechanics to model that we just often dont talk about this because biology is at much bigger scale and quantum processes become negligible and not a useful description at that level,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWHlBeUxidUVoRk1jUktabGJyYUlfd0lkbUlTUndkNTJuSjBrN2xoekpBcjk4UnBSOUZkbVlLa3BKQTVIZ0hkUG1GN1Q4X2dwcW80bkttOHJFUmcyQWc9PQ==

kind of two fold with my limited knowledge also this is going to sound weird due to that lack if knowledge i often stumble into real things without knowing their name so bare with me <number> energy radiates outward from a natural point in a straight path away from its origin it can be redirected but typically this is at angles not curves because <number> gravity only affects objects with enough mass the less mass an object or creature has the less effect it has though this varies based on the force of gravity case in point is the description of what happens when you drop an elephant human small animal and an ant off the empire state building horrifying but the elephant explodes everywhere making the biggest mess a human has every bone broken and their organs crushed the small animal isnt much better but just as dead the ant the ant might float off a distance away but be perfectly fine a particle simply doesnt have enough mass to be affected by gravity michio kaku had said in a video a while back that the equations to figure out the necessary force of gravity was infinite x this was in relation to the break down between quantum mechanics and relativity how they dont work together now then the issue is that the accretion disk in the movie doesnt match up with the image that they managed to capture granted its not very clear due to the distance,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWXlxbnI0RXlXSzVUWVFudmlHd282dEN1VUNESTQ3LXpKa0x4NnVRM3d6TGlhcnRrem12LTVPVm9kMFBtU0NJY2I4N012YWNseWQ1MEZGdFdqZWZxa0E9PQ==

so applications of chernsimmons theory and adscft correspondance in condensed matter mean nothing from the evolution of the physicists picture of nature by paul dirac >schrodinger worked from a more mathematical point of view trying to find a beautiful theory for describing atomic events andw as helped by de broglies ideas of waves associated with particles he was able to extend de broglies ideas and to get a very beautiful equation known as schrodingers wave equation for describing atomic processes schrodinger got this equation by pure thought looking for some beautiful generalization of de broglies ideas and not by keeping close to the experimental development of the subject in the way heisenberg did >i might tell you the story i heard from schrodinger of how when he first got the idea for this equation he immediate ly applied it to the behavior of the elec tron in the hydrogen atom and then he got results that did not agree with ex periment the disagreement arose be cause at that t ime it was not known that the electron has a spin that of course was a great disappointment to schro dinger and it caused him to abandon the work for some months then he noticed that if he applied the theory in a more approximate way not taking into ac count the refinements required by rela tivity to this rough approximation his work was in agreement with observa tion he published his first paper with only this rough approximation and in that way schrodingers wave equation was presented to the world afterward of course when people found out how to take into account correctly the spin of the electron the discrepancy between the results of applying schrodingers rel ativistic eel uation and the experiments was completelv cleared up >i think there is a moral to this story namely that it is more important to have beauty in ones equations than to have them fit experiment if schrodinger had been more confident of his work he could have published it some months earlier and he could have published a more accurate equation that equation is now known as the kleingordon equation although it was really discovered by schrodinger and in fact was discovered by schrodinger before he discovered hi snonrelativistic treatment of the hydrogen atom it seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in ones equations and if one has really a sound insight one is on a sure line of progress if there is not complete agreement between the results of ones work and experiment one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly taken into account and that will get cleared up with further developments of the theory >that is how quantum mechanics was discovered dirac goes on to discuss general relativity another theory we have thanks to mathematical not experimental insights,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSkoyZEl6dzVoQ1FIRjhRWnVfYXptRjRERGVKNGtZcnFkOURlN3VWSjFlY1ZGMkZhY184Q1JLOUdVV21GN3BLYlZZVDhRWlMwTnNIaXRDbThWNHNxVGdaOU9EWnZsZW45T2tRdmk3RnhlMFU9

i understand that youre excited about the new concepts in physics youre hearing about but given that you dont yet know what you dont know assuming that your thought is original or that its meaningful is mighty bold or stupid but im giving you the benefit of doubt by merely calling you bold you may absolutely have a wonderful idea but to test it start by understanding how science works <number> a new idea in science is called a hypothesis a hypothesis must make testable predictions if your hypothesis involves alternate universes theres no way to test it so itll go to the crack pot ideas bin^tm <number> the test must be independently repeatable and verifiable no point having scenarios that will occur only once or randomly or never <number> the burden of proof lies on the claimant if you propose a hypothesis you should come up with the theoretical or experimental evidence for it theoretical evidence is a mathematical proof that is consistent and built on existing theories or can morph to existing theories under appropriate parameters for example einsteins relativity theory predicts how matter and energy behaves at near light speeds but it turns into newtons laws of motion at real world speeds which we already know to work start with newtonian physics and basic math promote yourself to special and general relativity since youre interested in the very big learn classical quantum mechanics qed and qcd to understand the very small all these theories already work under specific conditions and only break down at specific points by this point your physics and math will be at a level where you can validate your own hypothesis and refine it as required,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZc2RDWU9oRDN3MGxjOXR4TkNINVJoQm1hUENuRUVoOExfRUxHNGFiNVBlSDQtbWxaMXVzZjFXSW9oSjZsQ0pBNVpXOGlObkNSelc4aHl5MGlTZTN3amc9PQ==

a propeller is in front of a wing or wings and sends some air over the wing a jet generally sends air behind and from under the wing or they are mounted even further to the rear so apparently the thrust must propel the plane forward fast enough to create enough wind at enough speed and volume overunder the wings to create lift either a long treadmill and exceeding the treadmill speed or moving forward off the treadmill too we arent talking about jato or rato thrust here,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdTd6SVJLSHJZLVBycXdZb1Z5VDR2cGlfaWt6Y0tQVUhXTmIwdWVmU2V3OWN1RXZvTmZCeFdqZE1DdG5lSVphRGRWd1VtbUNVcTdxZ2k5bGVhSlRJQWc9PQ==

ill repost my comment addressing the whole its not physics argument which you were making from the evolution of the physicists picture of nature by paul dirac >schrodinger worked from a more mathematical point of view trying to find a beautiful theory for describing atomic events andw as helped by de broglies ideas of waves associated with particles he was able to extend de broglies ideas and to get a very beautiful equation known as schrodingers wave equation for describing atomic processes schrodinger got this equation by pure thought looking for some beautiful generalization of de broglies ideas and not by keeping close to the experimental development of the subject in the way heisenberg did >i might tell you the story i heard from schrodinger of how when he first got the idea for this equation he immediate ly applied it to the behavior of the elec tron in the hydrogen atom and then he got results that did not agree with ex periment the disagreement arose be cause at that t ime it was not known that the electron has a spin that of course was a great disappointment to schro dinger and it caused him to abandon the work for some months then he noticed that if he applied the theory in a more approximate way not taking into ac count the refinements required by rela tivity to this rough approximation his work was in agreement with observa tion he published his first paper with only this rough approximation and in that way schrodingers wave equation was presented to the world afterward of course when people found out how to take into account correctly the spin of the electron the discrepancy between the results of applying schrodingers rel ativistic eel uation and the experiments was completelv cleared up >i think there is a moral to this story namely that it is more important to have beauty in ones equations than to have them fit experiment if schrodinger had been more confident of his work he could have published it some months earlier and he could have published a more accurate equation that equation is now known as the kleingordon equation although it was really discovered by schrodinger and in fact was discovered by schrodinger before he discovered hi snonrelativistic treatment of the hydrogen atom it seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in ones equations and if one has really a sound insight one is on a sure line of progress if there is not complete agreement between the results of ones work and experiment one should not allow oneself to be too discouraged because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features that are not properly taken into account and that will get cleared up with further developments of the theory >that is how quantum mechanics was discovered i really dont get whats with people like you going on about how we need new physics but then strawmanning the physicist doing just that in what essentially amounts to wah no one is stopping you or anyone else from coming up with a better idea but if youre going to act like the likes of dirac witten susskind seinberg maldacena have somehow wronged physics i think youre going to need to back it up a bit better then id say im a physics virtuoso whos studied it for around <number> years and knows a heck of a lot about it including how to compute feynman path integrals and derive the schwarzschild metric of general relativity hence why the mods dont want to leave these low quality post up,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSXIxNGdWVjNpT1FpeVJQXzJqNzlWbDlSbW4wdlgtQVRXa0kwTldBUmFOR2lidDRWV3F5V2hiVHc0R05PaEZPa3ZJVGloWW0yY05aMnUxOU5INUJ4ajRETTFoVlBITTFkTC1jaU01WTNDbDQ9

im not sure if this is a helpful comment but i really liked some videos on the subject by pbs spacetime vsauce and veritasium they dont necessarily go into the math but they do a great job at explaining a frame of reference the bending and dilation of spacetime the speed of causality and the consistency of light from all frames of reference trouble is there are a lot of videos on the subject and even within those three channels they tend to break it apart into smaller sections or combine even smaller parts into related topics like black holes and the possibility of other universes so if you have the time and the interest itll be a rabbit hole worth going down i recommend getting a grasp on the concept before attempting to study the math,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcVJYal93QUtCZnV5RFhpQ1NTakVjODVJdE8xZlV5b3h1cUgxY21qRzYxT3lXcVUxMDZENVlaS1c5RW1Xd0lmMTBMeWYyTlA4bTVRLXJJUmdDc2I3VHc9PQ==
the casimir force is one that always gets to me intuitively the concept is straightforward you have two conductive plates that are parallel to each other lets assume they are in a large vacuum like an empty universe they will attract this is because vacuum fluctuations will be subject to boundary conditions imposed by the plates and the number of em modes that can exist outside the plates is greater than the number that can exist between the plates this difference in energy density leads to an overall force that pushes the plates together the thing that i consider mindbending is that calculating the force between the plates involves computing the sum of n from n=<number> to infinity there are multiple ways to analytically continue the solution of this divergent series where instead of getting infinity you get <number><number> mathematicians will tell you that this is an erroneous answer and one of the pitfalls of analytic continuation but the curious thing is that the <number><number> works out for the solution of the casimir force even if you sidestep the analytic continuation and the result agrees with experiment all the fierce critics on this sub will inevitably downvote me for not mentioning regularizationrenormalization or not pointing out the fact that there can only be a finite number of energy modes because of having a finitesized universe or limits in the upper frequency bound by the planck length or that this kind of thing shows up all the time in other problems in qft or string theory or changes to the form of the sum and resulting force if not doing a d approximation or a dozen other things but theres no denying the physical confirmation of whats considered a mathematically erroneous result,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRWpsTVlfY24yYXRoVjlTMk1xbHJQRWlaV0lvYnNucHktZTd5NlpWb0RoTWJmcVhhT3NzdjZnSlcyQW9aY21KTjU0aXJZMldtWUR4RUtGT2U1RVVteFE9PQ==

im a mathematical physicist but i minored in philosophy in my undergrad so i might be able to explain it in a way that makes sense to you einstein first came out with his special relativity it is a combination of newtoniangallilean relativity and maxwells equations special relativity is derived from mainly two postulates a postulate is like a premise but it it always true the two premises are <number> the laws of physics are the same for all inertialnonaccelerating observers <number> it is a law of physics that light always propagates at the speed c from these two postulates we can logically infer that the faster you travel with respect to some set of coordinates the slower your time appears to pass from that coordinate since the speed of light must be constant in all reference frames something has to give since speed has the dimensions m t^<number> then these two must change for the observer in order for the speed of light to remain the same lets imagine our favourite experimental physicists alice and bob alice is sitting on a bench at a train station suddenly a train passes with an incredible speed c<number> or half of the speed of light bob is sitting inside the train and is looking out the window alice sees herself as stationary and bob sees himself as stationary now we imagine that its dark and theres a light in the front of the train since light has to travel with the same speed for everyone both bob and alice sees the light travel at c but this appears contradictory since bob should see it travel at c since the light is emitted from the trains reference but since the train is moving at <number>c we would think alice observes the light travel at <number>c but this is where we remember the second postulate both have to observe the light traveling at c so that implies that time must slow down for bob from alices perspective and vice versa this also applies to lengths both time and distance seems to contract due to relative motion but this formulation of relativity was derived ignoring the effects of gravity einstein eventually realized that gravity is locally equivalent to acceleration and from this he formulated the general theory it took einstein roughly <number> years to properly incorporate gravity into his theory of relativity and along the way he discovered the importance of the geometric formulation and the merging of space and time into a <number> dimensional spacetime of his special relativity done by minkowski and that lead to the general theory of relativity where gravity is the curvature of spacetime itself it is extremely hard to properly explain the significance of this curvature in spacetime without delving into some more abstract mathematical concepts the best way to get an intuitive understanding of how a curved spacetime results in massive bodies apparently attracting each other is to again imagine our experimental physicists alice and bob alice and bob are standing on the equator with their back turned against each other looking in the direction parallel to the equator now they both walk km straight ahead parallel to the equator and then both turn exactly <number> north and then keep walking in that trajectory eventually alice and bob will bump into each other when they reach the north pole to them it might seem as if some force has pushed them together they were walking in parallel lines north but they still somehow bumped into each other the key insight here is that the surface of the earth is positively curved any two lines that are locally parallel will eventually cross you can try it out self try drawing two parallel straight lines on a globe they will eventually cross this is the same concept of spacetime if two people are moving in parallel lines in a curved spacetime they will eventually bump into each other even if you arent moving in soace you are always moving in time an apple floating above the surface of the earth is moving parallel to the earth through time even if the apple is stationary relative to the earth but the time will curve towards the earth and therefore bring the apple with it physically as said this is hard to explain without the proper terminology and mathematics im also very tired today so i might not be the best at explaining right now but if you want clarification on anything let me know and ill try to improve my explanation,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaTdGRDV2RFYzZjFHRURzQTJOS3ktekppOTVleXZOVTJQc2VKUnQ1ZlpRNjJfcDBBejFVZEFmYUdNNUhRZzlWZU5jdzZab3ozWVp1UXE0cG4zVjJreWc9PQ==

you studied special relativity you know about the twin paradox it doesnt impress you anymore but what about the twin paradox on a torus a torus also known by its tastier name doughnut is a d square whose sides are wrapped around first you roll the square into a cylinder then you bend the cylinder so the two openings meet on a torus if you travel in a straight line you always go back to where you started because of the wraparound now there are two twins one stays on earth the other leaves in a rocket the traveling twin travels in a straight line without ever accelerating yet still manages to return to earth because the universe is a torus each twin believes the other underwent time dilation and is older neither underwent acceleration so nothing breaks the symmetry between them who is older > actually the symmetry is broken by the universe itself the definition of a torus breaks the symmetries between space and time of special relativity because we wrap around only space not time any local smallscale experiment will observe special relativity to work without any problem but any global largeexperiment that can realize the universe is toroidal will run into weird issues like inability to synchronize clocks separated by large distances ultimately the earthbound twin will be older <,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVzc4a3ljVmRVSHdudGhqQ1o0VG92em1aTjBXdzRscERfSG9TcmpNRnpad2Qxb0ZNeUhPRTJBRkVMUTlBYWZrNGJUdmozQTltTW45RG5uMUtlU0FTWVE9PQ==

when i was doing my ma i had an acoustics professor who was the person who first described how the resonant frequency of a glass shifts once you start going towards the maximum stress the deformation due to the mechanical stress of the sound itself makes it so that the resonant frequency goes higher ie you cant break a glass with sound by keeping the frequency constant the change in density and shape is the cause so personally id suspect that you could engineer extreme conditions probably easier in an enclosed system where you would have some non linear effect due to densitytemperature changes that are due to the amount of energy carried by the mechanicalsound wave itself,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ3ppQWctQ1dWckNpSlg5Y3V1VnBfaTdoZndIa01HTzA3YnFBcHB5VVVRVEpHN0Rqbk1qS1ZtMExLcFBCNDl5Vkhrc2FBQVRRMll1WF8zWEdUZmxxYXc9PQ==

ah good question so were currently in whats known as the nisq noisy intermediatescale quantum era what this means is yes we have quantum computers but at this point and time they dont work very well this is because the qubits we have are too noisy and prone to errors we have proven the conceptstheoryefficacy of quantum computing with single qubits and multiqubit devices but as we scale the count of qubits up in a system our results are so prone to errors that we cant reliably implement all of the quantum algorithms that make quantum computing so special the nisq era is characterized by having systems with <number><number> qubits which most advanced qc research facilities have but we need something in the order of <number>+ reliable qubits to really start seeing something special this is currently a major problem in engineering experimental physics and materials there really isnt a lot of theory work going on now because its pretty much all been laid out for us in the past two or three decades and now were just dealing with the actual application of scaling up these machines you may hear in the news stuff like google or ibm or some other startup making breakthroughs in qc with their <number>+ qubits machines but the fact remains is that no one can reliably compute with actually using over <number> qubits right now many companies want to jump the gun and offer mature solutions for what is a very immature problem right now and its a major criticism in research vs industry at the moment,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTmVYcEF2WGU5M09PUXJobFNlQTM2NnFBdmhZem9OaGNYaktEaGVZVHd1MUtmT0tTNGN0dWdMa2x0cGRjTXg5TjBKX1hwQUI0TDZLRlBxc0Z2OFdJQ2c9PQ==

i was a theoretical physicist for <number> years researching nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for me it meant a lot of stochastic processes combinatorics probability theory and we modeled complex systems things like population dynamics network models granular systems traffic flow interacting particle systems biological processes and we looked for phase transitions and interesting emergent behaviour or particular types of behaviour like glassy dynamics or the effects of disorder most of our work was mathematical but wed use computer simulations to supplement our analytical results in general its ubiquitous as a calculational tool in all sorts of theoretical physics its one of the three pillars theorists turn to along with quantum mechanics and general relativity you need it whether youre looking at fundamental particles and their interactions phase transitions in the early universe condensed matter physics or multidisciplinary physics applications if you look at the preprint archive at archivorg youll see all sorts of papers with the statistical mechanics keyword that should give you a fuller flavour of its applications,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMVE5WVJlb3ZsNlhWc1E5RUZhM29BeUlOTURUNTVoZGNqWG1aTHFWOFlVVHFPeXRlaXBKd2haVkxqSWZjNXQyUmFXQmdZTVBqLXhIUFowaEE5aFMxQmc9PQ==

this probably depends a little bit on how you define it and call it for example my university has a dedicated condensed matter theory chair that does mostly conductivity models and dft and a bigger statistical physics chair that does soft matter quantum phases and topological phases and such and is in my opinion less applied than the condensed matter chair a friend of mine wrote his bachelors thesis about some approximations for a soft shell gas which is pretty much an application of what you do in a statistical mechanics course,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQU1yaTdVSlhqVy03dFQ4eDBMbWVibFRPaUxjTUswa2FjXzJvbjVWT3Q0WDRQR2ZUSllnZDBKY3FqRExnMkk5emMzZWZaOWg1eG93TDk3b2MzTDFfMWc9PQ==

the same relativistic effect that makes mercury liquid also explains why gold is yellow while silver is white mercury is liquid because its filled s orbital is artificially contracted the same splitting of orbitals and the lower s energy results in gold absorbing blue light and emitting yellow and red since the s level is higher in silver the energy required to excite an electron corresponds to the uv region instead of the visible region consequently silver appears devoid of colors from the visible region of the spectrum,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaejNHcy1UUm9ORHlUVUZsOTZHaHduS0MyaUZzX2R6a3VIdzRXM1h1Qmx5WHdaR0tMY25WZlhDejNRbkw1R3hYem1RT3BrcHZoX1c3bUNNLU40c09yUEE9PQ==

so the only difference between a program and a desire is the degree of complexity then again my point is relevant since there is no real ontological difference between the two >sure but thats not an issue with my definition it doesnt mean my definition doesnt make sense it does though since it show that what is considered free will can then apply to robot or any mechanised device even cars i dont think smuggling drugs is that big of a threat to society to begin with,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYWxlVjc1ZUlPaERvZGt4RU04RjBNNml1Z1ZMRG5Uc3hIVDFXRTFFNF94QUxENDBBdGQ4U3FTNVlaaEh5QUVGR3FWSE5YTkJiNjFQdlp5b1JzMXBQdUE9PQ==

i dont think this is a problem related to physics although i have witnessed it often in physicists the adage that we all die alone that only you have access to the full richness of your internal experience came from philosophy not physics after all i dont think anyone in any context is ever going to fully appreciate the experiences of another human being you can find people who seem to get bits and pieces if youre lucky and hopefully find a community of people around you that together build up to a bigger whole but thats not specific to physics either in academia the drive to move around a lot and never put down roots until quite late really hurts our ability to build that community and so does the implicit pressure to socialize with people in your silo that is something that upsets me about academia but its all of academia not just physics my partner is a professor of public health and im a professor of physics i hope that i understand the jist of her work and i really try to but i dont have the training to get the details and the nuance but lots of stuff we share the stress of the tenure process and the politics of department life she gets and lives and id say thats even the same of previous partners ive had who worked outside of the academy in law of medicine or even routine engineering work likewise my phd supervisor has become a good friend after graduation and i really look forward to catching up at conferences where he gets a lot of the field specific minutia that my partner doesnt hes obviously not the same type of support i find from my partner but hes important to me for the place he holds just the same this community can come in surprising places a good friend of mine is a clown we met at the gym apparently clowning is hard work and believe it or not a lot of the struggles of the creative process translate really well to art and its made us very close as your career progresses the time between each subsequent discovery slows because youre not reading about discoveries of the past and absorbing them but waiting for them to happen through your own or your peers work that can be disheartening but teaching and mentorship allows you to keep a hold of a big portion of it supervising my phd students is by far the most rewarding part of my career and undergraduate teaching is second service is also very high and research has honestly fallen quite low on that list though still something i enjoy finding meaning and satisfaction from our career is one of the most difficult things we face in life not as physicists but as people i would challenge you to find a single professionalrelated subreddit where you cant find a post like yours i dont say that to minimize your feelings quite the opposite it emphasizes how big they are but i cant help but think that your choice of field isnt the biggest issue here unless there is something really fundamentally spiritually incompatible between you and the field which it doesnt sound like from your writing about undergrad or grad school it sounds a little to me from the little that you wrote that youre trying to gain too much of your lifes satisfaction from your career its a big part of your life but its not the whole thing if this isnt something youve talked to your wife about that is absolutely the place id start and not to put too fine a point on it but therapy is helpful not just for acute crises and suffering but for situations like this as well,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmFKRHFfcC03YTVQa2d5LWxtQjRkVS1nTnNWN3ZvaTVSZFBJN0FreEZGWG5YRHRrQkgxM29hNEJGa1lwODB4bGF3TjNnRld5WGNuY1FIY1prZHJfY2c9PQ==

in no science field will you ever find people that want to hear about your work unless you can discuss it in an interesting way i gained the nickname picoliters from some skating buddies that i spoke to about a big project i hd just finished before arriving at a party which is to say that they did not appreciate the science but more the word picoliter i thought being the best scientist would be so cool to women too but surprisingly no its not about what you do its about who you are and how you make people feel open up and allow yourself to be humble because many people will have profound wisdom outside of science some wont and thats fine again its about how you make people feel around you vice versa not everyone is gifted with intellect imagine the vanity of someone beautiful saying i cant find anyone that cares about how pretty i am you know its not an attempt to label you as vain in any way just thought experiment live in the present and enjoy it,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQVJVSk5ZWUw1cnVTd0pnaUNmVGdya09iT1dDaGxrNHFKQXdXUFNfVmJueExGQ01FZjJDWWZwV0xLT0lRNUlwMDgyMlZ4RE44U191SjBhV1I3cFFlWEE9PQ==

they can work out but i think on average a good research university will be better youll be applying to research universities for grad school and the faculty there know other research universities they know how to assess the curriculum and your grades youll have access to more specialized courses your research experience will be with faculty members that are better known at lacs the faculty dont have research as their main focus and are usually less known to others and so your letters will be stronger the main pro at an lac is that youll get lots of attention and will more likely be given the resources to succeed its just that the resources are probably going to be less than what you would get if you do well at a research university there are many examples of lac students who do well for grad apps though,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTFI1TVZ1d0g0anZLWkhMMTllX1FlUWxLUmpGRU9WSVBIYkQ2eUNvOEhyMUxVWDViRDdvMS1QY2QwSDdmdUtiVHJKN3FIaW5RSl9TV1hUWEdkLUVGV1E9PQ==

there is no parallel universemultiverse theory a theory is an explanatory hypothesis that has been rigorously tested and is congruent with the available data multiverse hypotheses on the other hand are not well tested it may or may not be true that our reality is composed of multiple perhaps infinite universes but there is currently no way to test this kind of hypothesis and therefore it is just speculation not a scientific theory >does that mean that there is a parallel universe where the parallel universe theory does not apply im not sure this question makes sense are you asking whether there could be a universe within our multiverse that is somehow disconnected from the rest of the multiverse in a way that makes it functionally as though there were no multiverse from the perspective of someone living within that universe if so then you could argue that that is the state of our universe our lives are unaffected by whether or not the multiverse exists and we have no means of testing for its existence in any case this is probably best asked in an actual philosophy sub this sub is more for serious discussion of physics not philosophy,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSHJMZmhpaFA1MXlqT1REUEhLYXczSGdOM3QtVDNWT2o2MEY2REowNHl6YUNBWi0tR05rNjROajFPTjJreC1zMDF3LVN1Z2d2N3dLeXdpUVNCQWpITFE9PQ==

we observe the things we describe as chairs and tables we dont observe counterfactual realities i dont observe the concept chair or table just like i dont observe any counterfactual evaluations of a casual model that dont instantiate in reality realism following from phenomonelogical experience is a pretty silly concept to me to begin with since its essentially a rehash of the isought problem but for metaphycics but at least with most questions surrounding physical realism we actually observe the things in question as bundles of sensory experience we commonly define as belonging to categories of chairness or tableness in varying degrees for example the purpose of the analogy to geometry was to emphasize that to claim the realism of something free will that has no instantiable as opposed to potential access to a constituent part worlds in which alternate choices were made makes no sense similarly it makes no sense to talk about the quadrangleness of an observed three sided object even if that object could be made quadrangle by cutting off a corner at least at the macro scale obviously the number of sides we assign to the description of an object is dependent on the scale at and method with which that object is measured modal logics admit a sort of implied metric to evaluate similarity among different possible worlds which could be interpreted as a sort of way to observe counterfactuals if we take the instantiated reality as a sort of weighted superposition over nearby worlds unfortunately that seems a bit forced to me especially since it just kind of kicks the can down the road by necessitating the realism of those modal superpositions,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZGFyeS03Z29VcC05WG52YkpmOWVFTDlYTHhwZEJ0aUZNb2VmdFBYdV9EUjcyNHUwbmZpWVNPT014UEp2UnNDczhPTXRyN1R5bnJDNHU4ZGt1QVloaFE9PQ==

to be clear the <number>sigma number is known to be almost certainly much too large the rratio dispersion method is probably not using correct data the babarkloe situation has been known and ignored for some years thanks to the socalled pdg approach to statistics which drives me nuts and new data from cmd seems to suggest a number closer to the bnlfnal experimental numbers meanwhile the lattice hybrid approach used an overly optimistic extrapolation technique to seemingly validate the rratio number and the pure lattice calculations are also coming in closer to the experimental number so the theory prediction is clear much worse than before while the experimental number remains the same although it is also shifting slightly towards the various theory predictions,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhMTl3VFA5U2pqR28xbmt5QmhRVnlnbmVkdmJCeURLWWlKVVU2U21naG1wTkpaSGM1UEc4MVN5cDBkcGptUF9EaXdXczhfU0owWDhEWk8ydDBTQXFGMFE9PQ==

ive never solved such problems but it looks quite interesting im guessing one way to solve this would be to model the contraption with corresponding electrical components capacitor inductor resistor and battery and then use control theory to derive an impulse response formula for the system in the laplace domain then apply convolution with the input signal to get the output a physics way of solving the problem would be as you mentioned to analytically ascertain what the equilibrium of the system would be under a constant force and whether the system will even have time to reach the equilibrium based on my understanding the equilibrium under the given constant force would be when the either sides of the damper has a relative velocity of <number><number> ms the block m would be moving with a constant velocity and the block m would be experiencing the entirety of kn of the force since neither the spring constant nor the mass m is enough to sustain the block m in equilibrium state the block m will be suspended at <number> with the tension bearing the brunt of the force and without even calculating i suspect <number> second of the input force is enough to reach that equilibrium i doubt your professor meant to give you such a problem,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZ2NXYl9KU3hIN0FFWjMzSVVJSW1VbkRKWEtpbUk3LS1NaldOVS1DXzlzNExGS19wM2pfN2QzMjFaY2N6cE1kSHRWSDdhWWdDNkZxaGlRTUJRN2RLQnc9PQ==

small angles is the way to go here if you see a pendulum this will likely always be the case i havent looked deeper into this problem but instead of trying to find the equilibrium state try to find the equations of motion so differential equations once you have those you start at t=<number> with zero deflection and zero velocity put in your force and see what the equations of motion return in the first second my guess would be since you have a dampener in there you will never actually get close to your equilibrium state in the first second after the first second the force of course is not applied anymore so you assume continuity of position and velocity at t=<number> sec and then apply your equations of motion with no force the system will then return back into the resting position with zero deflection,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhTDZiWmFrQlZ0M2NtQTJNeWpnR2lJSzVNUzFWVUFJbGZpS3p5UnFXb2hwZXdnUHplanBzZjlTNmRpelpTZUVtczUxbDJpdmlWdjFsMHdLR2Z4SGEwOUE9PQ==

i thought of a new way to explain one of the problems a damper is a component whose force is proportionate to the speed at which it moves at equilibrium the speed of everything is either constant or <number> looking at the system assuming constant speed doesnt make sense because of what it implies physically the other option is the speed is <number> meaning no force is transferred through the damper the third option is pretending the damper is only transferring the force directly to the pendulum but if thats the case and assuming the cart cant be lifted other wise there is no solution i have no idea how to calculate the angles since both the spring and damper pivot and no lengths are given if you think im mistaken or can help me with calculating the new assumed state that would be great,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhU0thZTZ0R3VZVENRUmlkWHA5ZXdSUzZJX2xURktvWXRkVllqdVhPVGQ2U05xYnBieFJSaDh1RWFqZDFBaXluaC1zU3c0bzBZR2xvM29kMGZCakFYR1E9PQ==

>you have to keep learning because theres so much you need to know to be helpful and productive yet now it feels like youre getting diminishing returns on your investment problem solving in real life is much more difficult than solving the last page of questions in your statistical mechanics book i would agree that solving industryfacing problems is more difficult and less glamorous but i would argue it offers a much higher return on investment academic learning eg solving stat mech text book questions is valuable and a necessary foundation but its a flight simulator an approximation to a real world problem with simplifications so that you can learn solving a problem in industry ie flying an actual plane is a much better return on investment even if its messier more difficult and even more routine because your contribution is much closer to its real world impact i think most academic work has a minuscule or no direct contribution to society although some indirect value often exists because inconsequential research can still effectively serve to train good scientists,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRXV6eHJwWFpLLWstX1VCMV9YT0dMYlpNTlA1Z0RBaUNPcTB5Z0szbnV6TDhsWUZmZFhNbzg5TFoyRDFCd3NwdUNSM3JFMG1ZdnJmZ0xKR3BzVWlkRkE9PQ==
but note that the streak is about a foot long that implies with your speed which i think might be a touch high probably closer to <number>fps that the shutter speed was <number><number> this is a totally feasible shutter speed but im not sure why anyone photographing a speech would use a shutter speed that high it also would imply a high iso otherwise even in daylight the photo would be underexposed again i dont see a justification for using high iso in this situation but still possible editng to add that with a more typical iso and shutter speed you could still theoretically catch the bullet but it would be so washed out youd need computer analysis to notice it and also to add that if we had the original raw photo itd have the camera settings embedded in the metadata is it out there,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNGs0LU1LOHZvS2dMOGpELWlKMHY1NjBRV1ZBM0hXR2U4SGQ0dWZZZC1HVDBaZlZQM2p6ZVA5Tk9FSkZId2RTNzFScS1HbGFOQ3N3STNjb1M2RGFKWnc9PQ==

the size of the streak is going to be directly related to the shutter speed and bullet speed and this streak is about a foot long which lets us estimate shutter speed by estimating bullet speed and if a very slow shutter was used the streak would be much longer but incredibly washed out and hard to see so why is a pro photographer using such a high shutter speed to photograph a public speaker its not a car race or a tennis game,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheVFEYjFFZ2ZGTUd6RUxYTlV3X2Q5TEgyN0tIREc2Y0NsQldKMEd0Tm9NR0RYTDNqN3gwU0VaUkdpQ04tcHRNTE92OGp6eEJPTkFlQWtqWVlCUldyMnc9PQ==

i understand that effect but thats not what im talking about the advertised salaries in spain to me other physicists i know who actually did move there and profs there told me this is how they do it include the employer tax so spain like the us and many places has basically two kinds of income tax one the employee pays which as you point out depends on a bunch of other stuff but there is also another one which the employer pays in the us and many other countries the advertised salary is the amount spent after the employer tax is paid in spain some people advertise the total hit of the job to the employer which is before the employer tax is paid so for example suppose a persons income tax is <number> and the payroll tax is another <number> in spain if they advertise a job for kmonth then the person actually only actually takes home <number>kmonth but for the same tax rates in other countries a job that is advertised for kmonth the take home would be <number>kmonth but would cost the employer more the point is that employers in spain intentionally mislead to seem more competitive with jobs from other countries it may well be that other countries do this too,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUXc4TGp4Z2QwTnJkNEZnbjBfdzk4elN4eXFqanQwZ05NclZ0WUZ1UnBGekpYLWFrVnpfT2RkUFNfeXFwOVQwNFhPV1o1cHhrTW5ZSmVTeWhzU2FlWWc9PQ==

listen man i know youre feeling bad but you need to realize that no matter how much time has passed you are the old you if youre not happy doing what youre doing its never going to spontaneously get better it mainly seems like you feel isolated in your life and career have you tried joining some sort of group for a hobby that is entirely new to you having a defining passion in physics is beautiful but you can bond with people and find a place to belong doing all sorts of things you may have never even thought of before something active like biking or hiking is a great place to meet new people while also being active which is always good for mentalphysical health hearing the way you talk about your career sounds like you feel as though youve sacrificed your life and career in something you arent enjoying anymore or that has not had a payoff you feel is worth what youve put in its easy to get distracted and turned for a loop listening to other peoples opinions and expectations for you but you need to consciously internalize the fact that the literal only thing at all that matters at the end of the day is whether or not youre happy where you are and who youre with this is a lot easier said than done and is guaranteed to create interpersonal conflict even so who cares ive had to break out of a situation similar to yours before and it takes guts and balls of steel to be honest with the people around you not to mention the feeling youre jumping into the unknown it is never like that though and these things can be massively dramatized in our heads something that stands out a lot to me is your idea that the more of a physicist you become the less human you become this is a train of thought headed for certain doom you are human you have needs that arent being met the fact you feel the way you do proves this if you are exhausted and unhappy devoting every waking second to this career that makes you feel not even human actually and seriously consider leaving yea yea yea its hard for everyone but have some perspective and never fall for the sunken cost fallacy <number> years from now will you have worked another <number> years doing something that makes you unhappy or will you have built something entirely new that brings you joy you are never going to think on your deathbed man i wish i hadnt stopped busting my ass doing that thing i hate i care about what youre saying because its something thats so easy to fall into and i genuinely hope you find your way out at the absolute very least dont push yourself so hard if your job really requires constant learning and blahblahblah it sounds like a horrible and screwed up place to work that shouldnt be expecting you to do what youre doing for them no matter what theyre having you do theres not a chance its as important as you feeling like youre happy i know all these things might sound corny im just a behavioral neuroscientist talking to a bunch of physicists so i feel like im basically speaking japanese right now but if you read this i think you should consider what im saying with an open mind everything you just expressed is the equation for chronic depression and suicidal ideation,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0NJa3E2N2ZoYko1QVJxNUlySExnX1pUZ0J3VEVlSUtPTDB4THJObVRjQVN0emppVTlrdWM3NTNaUGh6d1FOMXBmb1c1RjVUYTRaaGt4LU5OSmNXdHVkdk1fV3JWa005bm5YMndCM2dHUG89
as someone who taught th grade physics for <number> years the best thing you can do to prepare yourself is brush up on your algebra skills basic order of operations solve for the missing variable finding the slope on a graph depending on your school you may be learning some of this in your th grade math class at the same time either way my strongest students were always the ones who knew how to do the math,r/physics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZGtpZ3F0Y2VkaG5XT3JEdlVKV1BYQWxHaWpaOWFlODZZNElJbmwyYjRMVFBQZHpFNk01MUNnU21aVlpyd3R3NWw5Sl9hbkFyOFFtdkxIUERKNmxBOHc9PQ==
