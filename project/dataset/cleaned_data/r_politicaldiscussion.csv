personally i think it is because of zionism the perception of zionism and the hatred of zionism with respect to the palestinianisraeli conflict the world sees this as jews oppressingattacking muslims whereas when the powerful kingdom of saudi arabia attacks the houthis in yemen or yemeni civilians theres less of a kneejerk emotional story because muslims are attacking muslims the same for the syrian civil war which has claimed some <number> lives if our western society removed the perception of raceheritage and just saw these as atrocities equal in horror then the media would certainly give more coverage to the syrian civil war perception is everything in the worldwideweb facts can be obfuscated by the silver tongued i think it is atheism and a general distrust of all global religions and governments both abroad and domestic that allows someone like me to have the perspective and worldview that i have,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV01xdlNFaXhEV01LX25TTzJuRkNxa1AxSmRfa2hxWndZR3NiZTI4WTlHQU1oTXZTeWRvclZOVTY3NnhGZ1RKNWN2czNYZGluMGpGczUtOE04cVByZUE9PQ==

most of democratic leadership isnt stupid the public is the problem is that democrats in leadership positions do not want to give up power within the party by pushing potential candidates not beholden to them newsom buttiegeg whitmer are not winning national elections for a variety of reasons kamala harris would be fine if the biden administration hadnt kept her from picking up bidens slack and progressives hadnt sabotaged her and then there is the problem with the country still being racist and sexist as fuck democratic leadership would need to promote a political unknown a moderate to conservative democrat from the house whos name hasnt been trashed by the media they would need to reverse any strong position on unpopular wedge issues like gun control and just run on reducing cost of living and issues that have broad support not bullshit that democrats pretend have broad support but actual policy that in fact does have broad support this next budget there are no spending increases for anything except defense spending while we have had population increases and rising inflation and consumer prices its going to be an absolute cluster fuck any potential candidate who brings policy to the table to counter act the impending shitstorm is going to be strongly welcomed the majority of the democratic voter base is moderate to conservative democrat they are not progressives the demographics needed to win over are rural and younger votersso unbanning tiktok ending weapon sales to israel and shutting up about gun bans the path forward is telling all those voices to shut the fuck up that they are the cause for this mess in the first place it was sanders who caused trump to get elected in the first his campaign gained unauthorized access to clintons dnc server right before its contents were leaked his campaign was spreading negative messaging in rural communities suppressing the democratic vote he was the one who was a routine guest on russian state media like russia today appearing regularly for interviews and the ed shultz show there is a large pool of potential candidates to choose from who are not controversial pick a moderate to conservative female democrat or a more moderate left leaning male candidate thats half bidens age that most of the country has no fucking clue who they are tell them to shut up about gun control and push policies to stop the consolidation of business and the manipulation of the markets by investment firms and private equity and democrats win you could pull joseph kennedy iii hes a white redheaded left leaning whatever get him to never talk about guns again and say some shit about reducing consumer prices and ending climate change abigail spanberger again have her shut up about gun control and israel then have her focus on the economy as it relates to lower income americans democrats suck at strategy there just needs to be a strong voice in congress calling out these fuckheads who are blocking progress,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTG9wVFROeFo3c04wTVhtZ1RDSUZ6NzMtbWw0T0hLNEZZRXdzNzdtZi0xVVdqSi00czdCTHlzVDdTd0V3TW5JMGI5VGRDclBwLU9DbmhTS3E2WG0tSUFLVHJiNGtlbjcyalBHemYxdEpoMzQ9

i think these are good ideas some perverse effects will happen see comments for details but i think bookend rules are helpful the minimum wage was supposed to cover housing +food+bare necessities but because it didnt keep pace with inflation in time it became a joke remember if an employer pays an employee minimum wage they actually pay the minimum they can to avoid being sent to jail for exploitation i think the democrats failure to vigorously defend indexing the minimum wage is a betrayal of the working class president biden often makes the case that when unions do better everybody does better i thinka case can be made that a well paid workforce will lead to a faster growing economy,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR2syNkNGZ0ZPUjh0VXlma0JEakhZS21UZU1YUWp4MGFWS2MyLVF1emxIRmRMVWRSbEROUHV4UW9JUGJUUkdvSFhfUHRRMEs3c3FZZldzdnYxTi0tYlE9PQ==

both your arguments are based on false premises and tired ineffectual arguments <number> wouldnt happen in reality because the company isnt making more money it is just limiting ceo pay the company would not be able to pay the janitor k because it would mean paying every janitor k in the whole company what it would do is lower the ceo pay by millions and probably raise the janitor pay by a little bit sadly the reality is that the ceo is greedy and would probably find other ways to cheat the system anyways so fuck the ceo <number> is not an argument in good faith either because the reality of the situation is that teenagers are rarely working a full time job for any extended period of time and op said nothing about anyone needing to be on salary if they are then most likely they are supporting their family and would need those kinds of wages by your metric who is somebody that actually should be on minimum wage do they not deserve to make enough money to live in an area if they are working a full work week i think we could maybe agree that minimum wage should be set by the cost of living in an area and not an arbitrary number that tries to be a one size fits all nobodys saying that a fast food worker needs to be able to afford a luxury one bedroom apartment but every place in america has data on how much it costs at a minimum to live there paying someone <cur><number>hr might work great in a nonurban college town that has housing affordable to that wage lets say <cur><number>month per person where up the highway an hour north in the bigger city <cur><number>hr might be poverty wages and completely livable because even <cur><number>month gets you a <number> year old slum house on the flip side and hour east in nowhere ass rural shit holes <cur><number>hr might be too much that it puts local businesses under but its also unnecessary because rent is like <cur><number>mo for a <number> bedroom house that can be shared i know this because ive lived in all three of those types of places in the last <number> years,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVlVEeW8tWW42U1FTMVhFc1dmXzdELVZuVllJajNsaElSS2t1N20tcVA3SUNCYW91dG1VRk5hblloXzBKRDBLM1I4RzFiMXRwc2lBdlBhQy1nc0lWWGM4eDNHRFdLZVJ2UTEwQVh6Nk9PelU9
stock options are incredibly variable and are a large part of executive compensation do you measure its value at grant as it vests when its exercised or when its sold and turned to cash how are you valuing deferred compensation as well if the stock price increases by a large margin over a decade or so and the executives show a much larger compensation number as a result which doesnt change a companies available cash does this really mean you need to drastically raise everyone elses salary even if theres not enough cash to cover it do you cut their salary when the stock price falls regulations like this would be incredibly complicated to work through and could create bad and unfair results,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaWtHRWVNV2VKSDZHSTljWmZmRk1zR1c1NUx0cHpOeWxfTUJYWk1uMkl3TW5udG9CeGhFR1lCdHAzVV9CQTlSWUNTT1JIQWpjMUhEdHNHOUhpcmV3NnA2TGo4bnk5RmJVMmE1ZkVRV29YRWc9

i agree that things need to change for low wage earners i dont think that going after the ceos is necessarily the way to do it lets say the law passed today big companies contact out a lot of low paying jobs so those smaller companies would be on the hook for dealing with the new salary formula that this law is meant to help going back to big companies i am betting that the current executives would be grandfathered into their current contract otherwise they would likely quit if they are grandfathered theres no salary savings to pay for the lower end salaries to be boosted and a lot of folks say health insurance shouldnt be tied to a job thats a paid benefit our state has expanded medicare and while its not perfect i think that might be a solution to look at and retirement i had a government job with a retirement plan its great having seen the numbers they are two expensive for a guaranteed benefit guaranteed amount each month for life k is portable,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcXd2TW5MaU1YaFF1cm94S3pFb1g1bmxQVVRZcTNEeVRPWmFZOGZ6dkhGNXpWXzlJN0Ytc3ROcmZjLWpSMDF0RkJkdXE0NmZVdGZCWDBvTTBLdnhpb2o0cEhhS1o5TG9zYUhpS0cwbFJzdW89

you definitely need a way to include several other elements first the creation of those things tied to the minimum wage we dont have enough housing in the places people want to live and housing will keep spiraling upwards until thats fixed second you need to redefine what counts as a separate company and somehow address outsourcing otherwise the janitor doesnt count because theyre not employed by the same corporate entity and third you need to either bar compensation in the form of equity or have a way of counting that all the highest paid executives get a large portion of their pay through stock and stock options and often raise spending money through loans against that equity,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMG81WmlyeXE0UTdwN2U2enRwZUhEZzN5cTBlRmZ6OGtlSk13dDRETXNzc0c2ejlGWlpmLW1WVWJ3dGt4QVlyOUFsUGg5NXNhbllYWTlTeTd6RlM4VlE9PQ==

theres no way of knowing for sure until the shooters identity and motives are known if they were a leftist this will be fuel on the fire of the qanon conspiracy train and will convince many more republican and maga voters that the left is a violent despotic tyrant group that wants to silence and kill them or white people in general as some white supremacist supporters of trump posit trumps base and his campaign will benefit strongly from the imagery and they may even get religious about it saying he was saved by god if they were altright it could push the infighting that republicans are already dealing with over the edge certain notable white supremacist and christian nationalist factions have felt burned by trump recently including people like nick fuentes its also possible that it was someone whose money he stole under the guise of support for his campaign or the stupid trumpcoinstyle scams etc if they were neither theres a good chance this is over the recent epsteinrelated testimony about trump raping two thirteen year old girls in which case this will be a disaster for trump because the one thing that will still at least superficially enrage pretty much anyone to the point of violence is child abuse and his supporters might turn on him with enough attention drawn to that information,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcDc2Wnk5enlJdmo0REs2VlJCYmFWNzc0N3l5WV9uaERSdU9GeHdMZ1plXy1SbUFIMWllb2MyeDhMbTlpMEJxU2FaNndDSFlKX1JuTjdxdDJKTS1vY2c9PQ==

i dont just think trump has actively added to the increase in political violence i think hes also actively encouraged people to have less faith in democracy and fair elections and hes also encouraged people to have less faith in the fbi our government and the justice system i think its horrific that anyone would ever engage in political violence so its clearly a bad thing when its used against trump im also not surprised that it happened given all of the above this isnt just the democrats rhetoric being taken at face value its also a result of the desperation and hopelessness that trumps rhetoric has helped elicit that things have come to this fever pitch is definitely not solely on the shoulders of democrats at every possible turn maga have sought to turn up the temperature in this country there was never any attempt whatsoever by trump to turn it down it excites him does that mean he deserves to get shot of course not but lets not pretend that this extreme bullshit is purely a democrat problem its been building up to this this isnt a sudden singular event a dude came at pelosi with a hammer and got her husband instead the floodgates on political violence have been opened for a while now you dont get to wash your hands of this and pretend this is purely a liberal phenomenon were probably going to see a lot more violence coming from multiple unhinged camps now would be an amazing time for trump to denounce political violence of every flavor and to beg americans to turn down the temperature i guess we will have to see what he does with this unique opportunity,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeEYtLVZIMDFpaFBTNWNrMll1YzJ0ajA0UDVxMndiRUtaTW9OTkxIVzlMN0dvajNLTzdnNXBxYjh3VXFvRmdvQ21lbG9OeTNIVWhHcWJta0xvb3BsSHN0R2dFMXFpTTNLLUpObjIxTlUyUjA9

this seems like a curse at first greatest propaganda piece ever to be point yes its good imagery though the more i think of it the more this is gonna be forgotten by the general public what i mean is that its going to be a anecdote in a long list of events jan th the guilty verdict bidens debate performance only in select circles is this gonna be a shift and aa much as people are concerned with radical violence in the election with trump it wouldve been a natural descent into that as we got to november what has occurred is that the intensity of the election arrived today july th and with that i am intrigued by what occurs the rallies are not gonna really matter whether he comes intensely or not the general public has gotten a decade of a caricature by the media this will matter to the base of the conservative liberal and the extremist sides the only true question is ultimately by the time we get to election day which base will be motivated more by unfortunately there might be an attempt on biden how much of a rallying cry does that become for the left what if biden steps down and we get a new candidate is simply being new enough to actually win the election there is a part of me that because the parties have become such a part of the candidates persona that should either of them not make it then the new candidate is not gonna matter as much as how much personality and energy of the old candidate they can bring and whoever fails loses the election <number> trump and <number> biden as reference sorry for the terrible writing if something doesnt make sense let me know to correct my thoughts,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcjdjZmdRcUJkMEx1dTktSWhuQkgzWTlLbWtfNzN5OFRZSHBXM1JZblgzWjBwVWl3eTBNWHNKbkFtdHcxVTVQN3Zpc2RwVGhBdXR4VDh5aVFseVlsc2c9PQ==

from what im seeing of polling debates the question is less if trump can get his people in and more of whether biden can get democrats to the polls as they more regularly dont show up there are also questions about black men specifically swapping to trump in enough matters in swing states neither are his base and neither will probably be moved to do what they didnt already plan to from this event voting wise this is probably going to be a net neutral with a small help to biden just to get the debate talk off the media long as its treated respectfully which is why biden is going on a pause so we are for once safe to look at this objectively a horrible possible assassination attempt,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTnVaT2pMNndnSGVNZFRxV3lsT3RVeGJUbEFMSDdZcUpyTFBfUFZJQ1VGVWFvU1lPSUJlQThLNnZKNTQtRUY1aWpGQ3MxT0pNeXM4QXQ4Wm1xV3I1YlE9PQ==

i suggest waiting to quote changes in the uk and the nhs system as blocking access to gender affirming care something that was done by political conservatives the same groups behind the push for brexit and likely was a contributing factor to the conservatives loss of the recent elections the first time in <number> years they lost such elections they are the only country that has done so and did it as a result of a government inquiry lead by conservatives they also didnt ban their use just the prescription to new recipients as they can still be prescribed and covered by the nhs for people that were previously taking them the move was in response to a clinic that wasnt following the standard process of care for minors a single clinic was not following the proper diagnosis criteria or process i suspect that ban is going to be reversed very quickly given they had a bump in teen suicide right after the change to the rules,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZLXhfZXp3b2tMaXY5TXRxc1hpNW1xMWR0T1puZTlCZ0FKT1BCS2R5bHl0NzlseVczUmtfMWlFTm4zN2tsQ2szTzl3S0ktRk9MekZLbENzMHc5YUlNTEZfWVJKZ2U3X3BqY0pBanRmWG1KNVk9

to your point number one because im not even going to try to reply to the person who initially replied to me to whom you were replying presidential policy can impact fuel prices and in fact biden sold off a part of our strategic petroleum reserve as a force effort to lower petroleum prices because opec was forcing prices up by lowering production because they think that they are owed for revenue they did not make in <number><number> when the world was at a standstill by selling that oil on the open market oil prices were lowered which translated to lower gas prices not just in the us and all its knock on impacts it was a really smart economic move for which the president has not been given credit due,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN2VSNkFqeHV6ZlQwbl9RdFlLNzRYX0R0R2pHMVdUU1hMMUdkWHJMYnVaMWJzbDZIMjJpTXFZZXkwQlJkMVRkQjVWTlFXT2lnM0ZhNHhsMnpPNW9YeHc9PQ==

lets flip this question on its head how likely is it that the democrats will pass a federal bill restrict the sale of assault rifles if they get elected to the presidency you might see puberty blockers get banned for off label usage aka trans kids but thats about as far as it would get this isnt the worst thing the study would take <number><number> years to do and likely get approved however the warning label is likely not going to match the current rhetoric however we would be back to mostly where we are now candidly this is the slippery slope of government involved in medicine if we want trans people to have autonomy then parental autonomy needs to be taken into account thats a spectrum from vaccines to transfusions and personal autonomy abortion smoking drug use in our current political climate thats going to be an almost impossible conversation to have lastly lets say the republicans win everything come this election this is a group of people that turned getting a new speaker into a pissing match and threatened their new speaker silver times since im more worried about them watching shit fall apart while they piss on each other long before they do anything so organized,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYWhZeDJuYzdncHUtY0VyZmh3TmpWMkFNaEV5MVZrN01jOHlQQXVkY2lGNW5fTjdTdWVLb0tzWUhjZFhLbEJUXzVtVE51OXYwaTFkcWt0enVKYzJMMGc9PQ==

theres several issues here that ill try to articulate please let me know if anything i say here is confusing as im just trying to impart factual information and my own opinion first the practical right now no medicine or practice save hrt and genderaffirming interventions alleviates symptoms of gender dysphoria thats why its the standard of care the brain is largely a black box we dont know enough about how it works to target medication for specific areas or effects its all trialanderror that makes creating new drugs very expensive and because trans folks make up less than half a percent of the us population nobodys going to bother spending that money theres no profit to be made from successfully making it due to a low patient population next the ethical if we somehow gained the ability to cure gender dysphoria in the sense that we could remove all desire to be of a gender other than the one attributed to you by your birth sex should we it sounds obvious but i will explain the dilemma using another mental health disorder autism if we could cure autism i am speaking of mildtomoderate autism where people can live and function independently should we it is considered a disorder to be sure but that is because autistic individuals are different from nonautistic individuals for many autistic folks the way their brain works is a core part of their identity to remove that from them to fundamentally change how their brain thinks is in a philosophical sense turning them into a different person is that right to do would it be better to structure society so that autistic folks are better catered to that social skills are explicitly taught rather than just heavily implied and left for kids to figure out i know someone whos autistic and is amazing with money the place she works for depends upon her head for numbers that company would be worse off if she was not autistic to speak more personally i am a trans person myself if you offered me a pill that would remove my gender dysphoria and leave my body the way it is i would not take it my transness is a core part of myself and to remove that is to erase a part of who i am why would i do that just because its easy because i make some people uncomfortable thats regretable but im not giving that up any more than i would give up my love for trains or video games or chocolate for me the real cure to gender dysphoria is better manipulation of the body not the brain if surgery were such that we could sculpt the body like clay more than simple augmentations and reductions im talking growing or removing any body part you can think of changing your height and face and hair etc etc there would be no issues but were not there just yet,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWW1TSFRIVUNIVHQxQzV6Vk8xbXJxY0Z4UXd4M3VkVHBBMUdKbG01S0VmSlgxQVdNeURXSnBIUTFYSmJ5a0xTR2ZFc296bnVBMnRCSGlDel81RW1odzJDV1FmSllFRTh6ZFdoQWVNS2RobGs9

>democrats will say we dont need firearms to prevent a fascist dictatorship with the knowledge we might soon have a fascist dictator to be fair im not american but if i was i wouldnt think me personally owning an assault rifle would prevent an american dictatorship when the government can roll tanks down my street or use a drone to drop nerve gas on me my ability to bear arms isnt going to make a difference unless those arms include highly advanced million dollar weapons the true check on an american dictatorship has always been the states and their control of the national guard today and militias of the past in my opinion there will be a huge civil war before there is an american dictator as the military will be split the states will all call up their national guard and the military will side with the various states the various commanders side with it would be just like the english civil war on one side youd have the single figure of authority who likely has to flee the capital and raise their banner elsewhere charles fled london and raised his banner in nottingham which was a fatal mistake as london is where the money was but he didnt have much of a choice on the other youd have a legislature who would expel everyone siding with the opposition and use their powers money and legitimacy to raise armies if the legislature wins they will claim they acted based on the will of the people using the legitimate laws of the land which the opposition broke if the dictator wins they will claim the legislature broke all the laws and was corrupt and needed to be removed in that scenario i guess technically maybe everyone owning a gun helps but probably not it would be long and bloody and whoever controls the nations wealth is far more important than if you can save some money by having a byog militia,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSV9aZFVNUGJSa01veGJldTl3czZDWG44S0VOcDNuZm9jeFhXd21WbjlXaU1kY19SaXRCOXpqNmlEbTRDNmdvWTFYaVdWUnlfOFRYckhYdE16T2FydFE9PQ==

>the us lost the war in afghanistan to people using weapons and firearms from the ww to the sa lot of time even older did they you must have been watching a different war to me then you see the war i saw was that the us steamrolled through afghanistan and took complete control of the instiutions of the country for what they were afghanistan has always been very decentralised very quickly whats more the us while deployed there controlled all major infrastructure installed a new government some would even say a puppet government that did what it want and then kept it in place until the us military withdrew the us lost the war in the sense that the goal of the war in afghanistan was clearly lasting regieme change and it was in fact only temporay because the us military propped up the regieme until it went away and then it collapsed this in fact proves my point and in fact aligns with every dictatorship on the planet military force is what is used to maintain dictatoships when the us military has deployed they have not been beaten by militias of guys with aks they have won the conflict quickly and taken control of the government and de facto controlled the country the last time the american military lost to people using civilians with guns was vietnam but even then the vietnamese were armed by china and russia throughout the conflict if the american military is ever deployed against the citizens of the us all the assault rifles in the world wont let the civilians win >democrats should have been pro gun for the simple fact that it would have helped them keep the house and gain a larger margin in the senate thats just politics though and while i dont neccessarily disagree with that statement it doesnt change the fact that the original position was democrats should be pro gun because we may have a fascist elected my point is even if you do elect a fascist gun ownership wont make a tangible difference because warfare is so far beyond what a militia can muster these days,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTkZhWmtRNFBVclJWOElLTjZodkN6ZkJHTnVzQ2NIbFRzUUROSkE5NWo2Qk5CUnBMWEQtelF1TVdveXh4N1N5eFJIM1ZyUU10WmpTTnJGTG1aSkxOa2c9PQ==

the only reason anyone even knows the name merrick garland is because obama tried to nominate him to replace scalia the only reason obama chose him to begin with was because before scalias body was even cold mitch mcconnell who was at that point the senate majority leader slithered into the oval office just to tell obama that they werent going to hold a vote to nominate anyone he picked and so obama remembering the words of his wife michelle who said they go low we go high decided that the high road was to just continue on and choose someone who was utterly bland milquetoast uncontroversial and unassuming the kind of nomination that a functioning senate should have no problem confirming merrick garland and he went and put garland out in front of the media thinking ive got em now now they have to have a confirmation hearing and vote otherwise theyll have to admit their actions had everything to do with dicking over liberals as hard as possible unfortunately they werent bluffing they said with their full chest that their decision to not hold a confirmation vote was all about dicking over liberals as hard as possible they even took it a step further and said that should a democrat win the presidency and they didnt even know who the democratic nominee was going to be at that point that they would keep scalias seat empty for as long as it took to get a republican president now what should obama have done well he had a couple options for starters he could have chosen anyone he wanted it didnt matter the republicans were going to block his appointment regardless then what he should have done was put that appointment on the bench without senate confirmation there is a legal precedent for this and while its a little bit extraconstitutional if republicans were going to break the rules he was well within his rights to bend them but coming back to the present what should biden do well if he should win another term he should fire garland hell the man probably wants to go home anyway he seems like he didnt really want the job to begin with and he didnt seem like he wanted to be on the supreme court back when obama was still in office then pick the most leftwing person he can find and put them in charge of the doj then stack the everloving fuck out of the scotus put so many democrats on the bench that it looks like the democratic national convention in there,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaXBWYWsyLWpsckc2VHE0M1dNbk00N1V5bnB0ODA1QjUySk9IV3cxUlg3bU1hNDQwRTdEYk5IZzVRNmJmTm1odjcyVVd5Ym0xYi1mcF93ZDBYUUV0cXc9PQ==

blaming a poor secret service response on biden is some of the most senselessly inane politicking ive seen today trailing only behind the biden ordered it conspiracies the idea that the president has or should have any say into how the secret service agents on the ground protect his political adversary is absurd and deranged there is and should be a disconnect between him and their operations imagine if in your scenario of accountability a president decided to limit or withdraw protection its nonsense to argue accountability in saying they should make it stronger without given them the power to make it weaker the fbi director is also under the executive yet is given autonomy to do their job as they see fit without presidential interference which would enable corruption if the president did have control over their opponents protection that would enable corruption its a shameful argument and i dont care what word salad arguments you try to throw back because you are fundamentally wrong the president is not responsible for actions of the secret service on the day in the moment and making such an argument is preposterous and politically motivated my opinion is apolitical i had the same opinion that trump should have had no power over protection of other former presidents during his term either blaming the shooting on the president is a stupid political talking point,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN1BBSnhONU9fa3ZWa2c2azBMZW9XZEZwdkRjZEN6ZVhsQmF4VUl6UVY3QkJGRzRDdElTOXltSGphenh1VXFFTWQxY0FaNjNtbGNXUGVKUTVzVUlVcnc9PQ==

the news media has an integrity problem what you have to realize that there used to be a fairly clear distinction between the news desk part of media and oped part of media while in theory there is still that separation its pretty glaringly obvious that the oped side of things is in the drivers seat when it comes to news media these days and sadly consumers eat up that shit the other issue is that the fcc abandoned its fairness doctrine in the mid <number>s which essentially legally required news media outlets to present both sides on any issues deemed politically controversial finally the news media is a reeling industry the clickbait nature of news has incentivized journalists to be partisan in simple terms journalists are far more successful getting eyeballs on their stories if they lean heavily into the preconceptions and biases of their respective audiences,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbzdyX2N6UmEyMVVNX3JtTzRUWFVpakp1OVM1c0c1TXJYWTI4MFNMTUMzeWJWQUJUamFkM0c4WFQ2eUNhNTd2cnRRN3QwX29Nc3VsODNIMnloY2hBazNsa0FPTEk4YkdFNVFYZUQtU0FyYWM9

im surprised a post calling out the medias role in the current political climate was allowed to be posted here but im glad it was short answer yes long answer the emotionally charged polarisation in us political discourse is precisely because the actual policy difference between the two main parties is so narrow instead of the media calling politicians out on this the help foster this environment fox news is notorious for it but even prior to russiagate fever pitch hysteria yrs worth mainstream us news outlets had zero credibility outside of the us they are all known for being mouth pieces for the establishment narratives not questioning or information presented to them they were even leading the charge against wikileaks assange when he was exposing us govt war crimes so yes when you deliberately exclude policy questioning elites from your coverage of politics then all you have left to talk about is mean girls hyperbolic nonsense,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYUQ5TlVFbXdBUXlRS0F3cjl4SjVDQ3lwRkpUOGstLVd0RjBtZU92NThvb3FhcUE4Wld2cEhyeTE0aTI0MV9rWW82S1lLeENPdWdDYUxQVzF6U3VqRTV4MjV2T21wbGVCRGM1UkpoY25WeUU9

tariffs are intentionally inflationary personally im not a fan of tariffs but the idea is that by raising taxes and therefore prices on foreign goods domestic production will eventually step in at a lower price no matter how you slice it or what the actual end result is tariffs are specifically intended to increase prices in the short term ideally only briefly but i have my doubts about that >protective tariffs are a means whereby nations attempt to prevent their own people from trading what protection teaches us is to do to ourselves in time of peace what enemies seek to do to us in time of war henry george circa <number> edit typos,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbU03RkxwYWtlaEM2QzN4aGlxeW1GbEdLNGNldjRaYzI1SWNtWldvTWNFVl9iZTRtQmx6eU1LUGhJSm5rQ2V4ZktBMGNMcmQwUXB6OUJMaHZKdUYyZVE9PQ==

tariffs almost always increase the costs of goods as they are a barrier of entry to the market that is passed onto the consumer tariffs sometimes can be used for companies to bring production inside the tarriff border and costs may reduce if it can be done efficiently but instead usually results in reduced competition and thus higher prices tax cuts do reduce the overall cost of doing business and can indirectly affect the price of goods but tax cuts are directly inflationary by increasing the amount of money available to spend and thus the demand for goods more entities competing for a good raises prices due to the inherent scarcity of the good to conclude trumps plans here will almost certainly increase the cost of goods through inflation and tariff cost pass through to consumers,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaWR3b2RxSGRQN0ozbGRkeFR2dDlFcWRnSXBYRjRFbHNPX3dPaFlwQldJeXVSTERTeWhaTHVreW5QR1ktNmluMl9seHRrOVdxTEFIWGpwcHd4N2prWkE9PQ==

not even close to an economist but i think trumps goal with the tariff is not simply draining money from other countries generally trump is in favor of keeping goods from america the ones who want to buy and forcing companies to base in america because it saves money if you tariff everything coming into america then american companies that try to make cars for example in other parts of the world then transport them because its cheaper will take a hit so they will make stuff in america to save money this in turn creates jobs and ideally would make american made goods the cheapest while also being the same quality helps the economy and should help the little guy in the long run we will see if it plays out that way but generally trump knows what hes doing when it comes to the economy,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSUg4cHIySDZ5RnhCODFoOVJXV0lJQ3ZzTUU4Y0tNckxVLWU4UHE2dzFzcjV5Wks4bEZjM3dCbEFSdndmcF9BLXd0bC1qcUFENExWZTkwZUFzTW9iX1E9PQ==

unless that american company outsources production to cheaper labor in another country so now to make the cheapest cars and retain quality they have to make their cars in america this alone doesnt force them to lower costs yes but what does is that to remain competetive the japanese made cars will take a lower profit margin to ensure the car sells because otherwise the american car company will take all the business now the american cars are encouraged to lower their own prices in response since they can go lower because they are american all ideals of course but its not as simple as more expensive here more expensive there,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYjVJV0ptZFdXU0piaFFaRHo1emR1Y3lCT05IQUkzbmRnWHFWa1JoUDdXczlIbS1CeHBDcXZqNHRyZlNNc25RMEVXOHpiOFFSdmhTdTZFV2V4MF9pS3c9PQ==

yes but this is just what america has historically done to minority groups within living memory you have had apartheid and segregation against nonwhites and in the s reagen quite literally let people from the gay community die on purpose of aids these are things that had pretty broad cross party support structural racism is embedded into the country and the political class has recently been engaging in mass dehumanisation of muslims to support its actions in the middle east again with cross party support this is all symptomatic of how authoritarian and anti democratic both parties are and always have been in fact if you had a proper voting system for the presidency and not the electoral college you probably wouldnt even have to worry about project <number> as republicans rarely win the popular vote even hilary won most notably wade vs roe was repealed under a biden administration that did pretty much nothing to stop it he couldve worked to codify abortion rights in the obama years or reformed the supreme court to be more democraticthe things that are scary about a trump administration like the racism christian nationalism and direct oppression and dehumanisation of minority groups and the poor are not things ideologically opposed by those in the democrat party because they have been proven to also engage in these behaviours when they feel like it and they dont ever make a decent attempt at removing these values from society if there was a true and sincere difference between these two parties you would see the democrats defending freedom of religion and making politics more secular with democratic reform to reflect that you certainly would not see them engaging in dehumanisation of muslims which is itself an extension of a christian white nationalist world view there is far more that unites these parties than divides them and though the republicans are presenting white christian nationalism as a policy platform the system of values underpinning that school of thought is not opposed by the democrats which makes them a very poor opposition to it trump may be a fascist but biden is not an anti fascist and the democratic party places itself closer to the policy platform of the republican party than it does to a theoretical opposite republican party would just look at political donations many of which are split between both parties by vested interests both parties are absolutely committed to an antidemocratic system of governance where policy is made for and by the rich and they do much more to unite on this than they do to divide themselves on cultural issues even with project <number> while saying they are both the same is a bit reductive of me the underpinning ideology of both parties is authoritarian and does not care for the plights of minority groups the lgbtq community the poor and women you do not have a left and right wing party you have a far right party in the democrats and an even further right wing party in the republicans but they both support the same economic model and have antidemocratic ideals at the heart of their party,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneV9OY3VRTy1Rb191M2xVVFlJbHJ2eDNjUmNoQy1FYXM0TWhoUzRDMUhrTVZhbG1uQk1VaEIyZWJVbTZOWnRNTlJGMVFubVFFNERjM0tveUJRVEFySUFVUUk1SDRESEd1YThCeHptTmxrYlE9

you are so wrong american inflation is simply the swings and whims of the federal reserve which trump has been threatened to remove of its independence during trump s term he criticized the fed all the time and literally bullied them into low rates that s how inflation was under control plus energy policies that favored all of the above and sucking up to putin and mbs kept the opec gas production in line which compared to biden favoring green energy and denouncing these <number> dictatorships has resulted in gas production cuts and higher gas prices which means higher everything now what trump is responsible for the inflation is printing a fuck ton of money during the covid pandemic which biden continued anyway inflation is still high because of the increase of m supply on a smaller scale the trade war with china also had a cost on prices but biden isnt backing down on tariffs either so this is a moot point in summary trump will control the inflation rate the cost is debatable should we keep bending the knee to such countries as saudi arabia and russia just so that we can make our money last longer well thats up to you >the average voter is not a trained economist who understands how this works they are going to go with who gives them better vibes on solving the issue this is a fair assessment but you fail to apply it to whatever you wrote,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnY1VEdVJHX0ZKbk9RSkY1VFhTOVh6ZzF4UC1SVDhucG9kczI1VUc3MW5TMGRkTVkyYzN2bjgtYlIwYVpSQ1hUY01aZTU0bmFOSDlIT1AxanE1OXVValE9PQ==

if you think that trump will ever behave in a reasonable or ethical manner about anything at all you havent been paying attention he is corrupt to the core and indebted to very powerful people who have a visceral interest in seeing him reelected he will say and do anything if he thinks it will give him an advantage and keep his handlers happy,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZ2tYSXI0ZlpzeUVQUm84dFBqYVA2ek1pbnVyRmVXa21ocnNnRGhDQWJzZ21pbW5BYWVzRV9vSkt6My1jUDllVVhKZmJmVjBYMGllVmZ5eHptYVFxSEE9PQ==

i would absolutely say its both sides trumps rhetoric has been very inflammatory especially his run in <number> in <number> and <number> it has toned down although still inflammatory but if you listen to adverts approved by bidens campaigns and what biden has said they are equally strong and inflammatory now of course if you believe what biden is saying is true then you will believe what he is saying is justified which is the same for trumps supporters and that is the crux of the problem biden voters believe that trump is a fascist they dont want to be police to fascists for the sake of being polite trump voters believe there are violent criminals coming across the border they dont want to downplay it for the sake of being polite you have two voting bases that belive quite extreme things and even most people in the middle have strong sympathies with either side,r/politicaldiscussion,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR3VHMVJ1NHlKRmxNMl9Xa3JXc3U3NG1NeDlaQldRUmRxY3BCNjhEbmZaM1VVNmI5REdTbVlpSC1oZ2UzMktZQmxSTWdEVHFhdXNNVnJrQWFCY0JVSWc9PQ==
