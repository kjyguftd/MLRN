not necessarily a critique here but just wanted to point out that in the primaries it is mostly the republicans and the possibly compromised republican party voting for their candidate so trump winning against his challengers just means an intensification of support for him within the party though his of winning votes is much lower with haley thrown in but does not mean the numbers of general election voters are for him also many of trump congressional candidates lost in their primaries which then throws his voters support into deeper mystery,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWFhfWGlLMkpXMjlUdU1CT3VBQU5VTmtza3pXeFhFSmJlSnZEdkVPc2dxa0VjRGtpdkw5OXhWalRmVnNBdHVzZktxeDkzOC1MeE9GWjJpRnBJdlV4ZHc9PQ==

i think we can go even farther pass a code of ethics and create a system for judging violations maybe a majority vote in the house judiciary committee which gets it an automatic vote on the house floor but the house can also move forward without the committee if it can meet the usual hurdles for bypassing committees i believe that impeachment is mentioned but youre correct that the constitution doesnt specifically say that they can only be removed by impeachment and good behavior is obviously subject to congressional definition,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcGZMQXlOTW5fM0xMSWJJaldyVVpXeGpGaDRvMl8wQVpWcUZUTllvVlJlUkdoelZ4amw1QjBCU1BpSml6ZG02dXJFdE1TejdQNlVlN3p2eEV6SFNOMkE9PQ==

interesting but irrelevant the president has to project a sense of health power and vitality hes lost that and the doubters have the media hes unlikely to recover from this its far more serious than the gaffes that have doomed presidential campaigns in the recent past this is looking more and more like ego vs common sense and hes hurting the chances for his replacement the longer it takes for him to quit,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMEs5VVd2MU5ZSXlCYjJLUG82cnJaRFd0S21wRWhTa3RVZVZDUjlOQlJnQm1kUDNfbEVnM1AtdjN3SjdUWEljZzJUMnM1LTZjUkNFWUFEc1FyWTRNUUE9PQ==

the potus is not all powerful currently and hopefully forever they dont control the economy only influence it and even then require a working congress not to mention a lot of economic policy is determined by statecounty officials the issues you are facing are real and demoralizing we all suffer similar issues currently the issues are a result of individuals making decisions that benefit themselves this isnt going to change anytime soon as mentioned by another trumps proposal will increase costs including his immigration stance the same individuals wanting to employee immigrants would raise prices on consumers if they couldnt further increasing prices i would advise looking into trades plumbing or elevator repairman for example once your economic situation is better look into local politics to see how local policy is affecting you,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmRESThfRWZxblJxZ3pUbHV1WUxyOXhYUmxaZlltcU5GbUtEYzhlckVoYkdrUGlpTUI2aFdUOU4wTHBsUmoyaTJoand0VFFtWWljX2VlQ1NrYll5YWc9PQ==

if you think trump was good for the economy then heres a little history and economics for you first off yes we had a great economy prior to covid what economists call a sugar high economy what do i mean take the historically low interest rates for example yes they were good short term buying new homes and selling went up fast people sold refinanced or bought new homes to capitalize on the low interest rates this increased demand certainly caused housing prices to start going up and in the long run was only going to cause prices to skyrocket as demand diminished the biggest cause is that more people than ever could afford a home because of the low interest in reality there is not enough housing and supply cannot meet demand causing inflated prices the other reality is the trade war which may be good for the us in the long run once we reestablish our supply lines and manufacturing capacity but in the short term the cost of goods we rely on and are completely dependent on from china immediately goes up drastically the cost of tariffs placed on chinese imports is passed on to you the customer the trade war also escalated during covid causing major problems and supply chain issues again causing inflation trump handled covid as bad as anyone could imagine during covid the middle class in america lost something like <number> trillion dollars trump signed those executive orders which allowed for the greatest violation of our rights in history businesses shut down without due process of law small businesses killed told by trumps government you are not essential you cannot operate safely you must die and only buy from your monopoly china supplied competition another fact to consider with high fuel prices is that this year the eia forecasts that crude oil production in the united states will average <number> million barrels per day bd in <number> surpassing the previous record of <number> million bd set in <number> we are producing more oil than at any other time and prices are high why the us has a globalized economy which is affected by world events and not everything is in our control since the ukraine war oil imports were cut for example in <number> the us imported an average of <number> barrels per day of crude oil and <number> bpd of other petroleum products from russia russias invasion was a red line of fuel price increases another factor is opec which has a monopoly on oil opec members control almost <number> of the worlds proven oil supplies opec accounts for nearly <number> of the worlds total crude oil production opec cuts oil production to drive up prices especially when they dont like the american president opec member saudi arabia actually owns the largest oil refinery in the us in texas and during political campaigns has shut it down for maintenance driving up prices to put gas prices into perspective the us imported <number> billion barrels of crude oil and petroleum products in <number> which is <number> of the countrys consumption so as you can see global oil supply and prices heavily affect the cost of fuel today even while we produce record amounts of oil in fact the us is still importing vast sums of oil from russia through countries like india so as you can see things are tough for everyone and the effects are not bidens fault saudi arabia announced an additional <number> million barrels per day cut in crude oil production while opec+ extended its production cuts through <number> this is to squeeze the us and influence our democracy and the election trump approved arms sales to saudi arabia that were banned by congress and trumps family made fortunes from deals with foreign governments while trump was in office including saudi arabia its easy to point the finger and blame biden but in reality why would the sitting president want prices to be high and the effects and harms this would inevitably cause politically president biden released a total of <number> million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve spr on november <number> <number> to lower prices for americans and address the mismatch between demand exiting the pandemic and supply additionally on october <number> <number> president biden announced the release of <number> million barrels of oil from the us strategic reserve its worth noting that the biden administration also sold off more than <number> percent of the strategic petroleum reserve to help limit rising fuel prices after russia invaded ukraine,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOXIzZUdFWHo4c19aR3B3b1hWelRMNXV4cVJNVHJWbE4tc1FtZjR1VnI3Y2NJS3c0S0ZHN2hEdmI4V3dfVVFOU19NcXJweE9pNUhhcThDaTlrWWNEalE9PQ==
also corporations are using various tactics to increase prices including dynamic pricing companies are using advanced data collection and algorithms to charge customers different prices based on their individual characteristics such as location purchase history and behavior price fixing corporations are colluding to reduce oil production and increase prices for americans at the pump profiteering companies are enjoying profit increases even as they pass on costs to customers many of whom are struggling to afford basic necessities corporations are using the guise of disruptions to raise prices beyond what their costs would suggest is necessary or what economic theory would suggest is prudent squeezing higher profits out of cashstrapped customers a significant portion of the american economy is controlled by a handful of companies that face little competition today they use their monopolies to artificially manipulate the markets and milk the population for every penny while were all struggling they are recording record profits guess what trump loved giving those corporations tax cuts and subsidizing them with your tax dollars even though they are out of control and raping the nation,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaGVfbHdJRWdnZVVJOVJ5VWhiZ2hYZTdqdHZxb3NwOUhzM25hdjJMV2ZPR2pzRl9CSG9HRzJ3UVlXaGc5aFdERmI2aHZZTUhzTVFUMWR3ZXRyd2RsZkE9PQ==
esperanto i think there are far more useful things you could spend your time learning the president does not have a dial on gas prices we are producing more oil now than at any time in history but taking russian oil off the legal market is the major driver of oil price right now the inflation was a result of a bungled response to the pandemic and too many giveaways to stave off a depressionbut likely you enjoyed those payments yes after most of the supply chain issues sorted out what is left is just corporate greed you think trump will go after his buddies over you your states economy is in the shitter because you have an idiot governor who is driving business teachers and doctors away thats not bidens problem either go read the nyt opinion piece published today and then tell me how trump will be good for you or the country,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYb2NIOXFNYjdOLXByVHEyeEN5UFFsbTBZcmtCRUJuUVl3NldaVTVLTnJpWjFib3VJZlg1RS1yTDBnRWxFTWdJSTd2SG1TUzFQbnBxRG9SdFJ3a1R6dHc9PQ==
> project <number> is worry some for me as a bisexual person but the reason why i vote for trump is how hard its been for me when biden is president and was checks profile hethey honeyyou know they hate the theys the most right > so when biden was president looking for jobs was hard they would kick me out from jobs no matter what i live in florida lots of immigrants and all they want here are working people from other countries than a high school diploma and college student who knows both spanish and english and im learning esperanto and nothing they push me away like nothing ive been without a job for <number> years and now i work as an uber eats driver earning low okay heres some tough love you need to work on your writing i dont know what your circumstances are but i had trouble understanding what you were trying to say here many of the jobs that you might be interested in are going to require written communication skills this includes decent paying jobs that dont require a college degree lets also put this in perspective according to your profile you are <number> i remember being <number> god i was both insufferable and an idiot im willing to be the same is true for you not super pertinent but i just want to level with you and say ive been there but its worth keeping in mind that you do not know everything but if this is true the last time trump was in office you were still in high school now there are of course teens who work but i presume you were still mostly doing school stuff now you sound like you arent doing college or any other training so you are just working wellwhat you are running into is just being a grown ass adult if you were not in the working world before how can you really say it was better under trump lastly esperanto is a party trick im not saying not to learn it but dont expect that its going to open up doors for you professionally > the economy here is trash even my family is having trouble to pay things and its expensive gas prices are too high and a <number><cur> candy will cost you <number><cur> ive seen lots and lots of poor people asking for money i cant even keep a dollar because of them im guessing you live with your parents or family i get that these are easy ways to measure how things are going but i think you need to understand a few things about florida before ultimately coming down on the side of this is all joe bidens fault i will get into these in the next section but i think you need to make sure the things you want to blame joe biden for are actually his fault > im fighting with my family to earn good money and considering im a citizen we dont get enough and we dont get any help im curious what kind of help you are looking for money social services i hate to tell you but most of our social safety net programs are run and administered by the states each state gets to choose a lot about who is eligible what benefits you receive and how these programs work yes federal funding and support is important and there are some aspects which are controlled or regulated by the federal government but a lot of what you actually experience is something that youre going to need to take up with the state of florida and ron desantis you should know that florida is one of <number> states that still has not expand medicaid under the aca essentially the federal government under this law offers money to states to expand these programs to help more people qualify for medicaid but in part because of how difficult republicans made this it had to be enacted on a state by state basis and some states still refuse the money florida is one of them i dont know if you or your family would qualify but i can guarantee it would help some people for sure next one of the things thats really killing florida is the rising cost of housing florida is of course a state which has a variety of challenges but floridas estate has not really been very proactive about trying to get ahead of problems and make sure that they are investing in the future we could talk about climate change but i think in terms of things like how theyve regulated or failed to regulate the insurance market is huge example this is one of the big reasons why florida is becoming so expensive because housing prices are not only going through the roof due to high demand for housing but you also have things which now cant be insured or cost an astronomical amount to insure lastly as it comes to immigrants and jobs i do hope you will remember that florida republicans had to beg for migrant farm workers to stay after some of the legislation they passed<url> dont get mad at the people who come here to work get mad at the people who hire them many of whom are republican donors who benefit from riling people up and from cheap exploitable labor anyway immigrants disappearing from our society simply would not help you and your family because they are so foundational to how our system runs that even if you had a job it may not be a job that you really want and many things would be way more expensive due to a lack of people to fill those jobs and the higher wages that would need to be paid in order to attract and retain workers heres the thing republicans dont really care if you were citizen or not they dont really think its their job to help they think you need to sink or swim no matter how rough the waters are yes project <number> is bad when it comes to lgbtq issues but if you think that its going to help you and your familys financial situation and also provide anything like a social safety net then you are sorely mistaken continued

> so thats why im voting for trump so he can save me from the financial crisis im going through i dont care if my rights are gone my body makes the choices but being poor and living on the streets is my greatest fear again <number> and dumb ill be honest your vote matters <number> in florida florida will go to trump but as a symbolic gesture i would still encourage you not to vote for him i really want to ask yourself just on a basic big picture level what exactly does trump plan to do fix your specific problems like what basic things is he actually going to do to accomplish his stated goals im sure that youve heard all kinds of constructed arguments from the people around you about how trump will make things better but really can you actually explain to us how that works can you explain to yourself how that works or are you just taking his word for it and do you think we should run a country on just trust me bro yes joe biden and democrats are not perfect i have plenty of criticisms of them myself but that being said i do think that democrats try and are sincere about their beliefs and as much shit as we tend to give them democrats do a lot of good things it would be great to have a second party that is reasonable and which operates in good faith but that is not currently the republican party > so yeah i wanted to know if anyone had the same experience or are voting for trump and are from the lgbt community so look i get it you feel trapped and are willing to try basically anything to see change happen but this is almost certainly something you will regret especially as a queer person the reality is that most queer people who are republicans tend to be very rich and are simply looking for a tax cut and think that their money and power will buy them protection from whatever affects republicans might have in store but thats not going to apply to you also i would just note that a lot of people who fall into this camp are people who tend to have a lot of unresolved issues and a harbor quite a lot of self hatred dave rubin is a perfect example of this again having also been a young gay with a big ego and sense of self importance and a flair for the dramatic i get that you want to differentiate yourself but you do need to be aware that this instinct can lead you to make bad decisions it takes honesty and effort to reflect on why you were doing things and whether or not your initial intuition is even correct like i mentioned its probably the case that your vote for president isnt going to matter much but i do hope youll think about some of the issues that republicans create for not only your state but the entire country lastly i do think that you need to understand what this means for your dating prospects moving forward there will be a good number of women and certainly many gay men who simply will refuse to associate with you and maybe youre ok with that in theory im not sure you are prepared in practice,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX1BZUWJCTDZBLUFCMXI1eVA4MnhnNnRqZFFwMzdweEkwVkFMdkxCRUF5bkxYdGw5bjczS3NPOEVhTGF4aE80Ym02SG9jcUpjemRKVlJyUDZQanpVU0xiYm9Xb3V1REFVd3MtZ2E0OVNZYm89

biden may not be the best choice but right now he is the only choice if we were a year or more out yeah we could weigh options but this close to the election no one has the time or money to get a good presidential campaign going would i like biden to step down and someone else run yes if that a good option now no the democrats are stuck best thing they can do is all back biden <number> because i dont see someone else replacing him and winning unless something crazy happens that no one can predict or expect,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMTRvT2VkYXNpVzZqVnFJbjN2YkJKMWliSzdocl96RXAyalBmUVJTeHlnakl1SGRtRVZMRnE3VFF5dHR1OF8yVXNXT2IyanBLeFp1TDJZY185bEJFNlE9PQ==
yeah i have many criticisms of biden as nobody is ever <number> great but he is way above and beyond what i expected and i just dont get even if someone loathes him how they see a fractured party as something good besides the republicans who have been hoping for it for the dems since the beginning of bidens term biden even if one loathes him is better than the devastation trump and the republicans are threatening to bring to this country and its founding principles,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaUw0OFVGZUJSaEdYb0lCRVlrVDdYTENaUm1qcWJVVHI3WlFtR2RKUnlvZk1tUHB0bGd1U21ZZUtKRGpRWk1nWUpfUWhpTkREQkpOVlFWV25zV3hkT2c9PQ==

really just curious what bothers you about him in <number> i thought he was the worst choice for candidate figured he was just another corporate democrat i was for elizabeth warren but couldnt vote in the primaries obviously or even pete b but the way he has fought domestically for the working and middle classes and for internationally democracy and getting our alliances back in shape despite his handling of israelhamas ive been impressed hes done things none of the corp demos would do anyway again out of curiosity why was he worse for you i wont pick at your opinion just wondering,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUU1zVl9LakNDZGxWckpyNmdpWHRMdlZCblNCOTVKOWl1WFE4ZXJ0OXd1bkx6cjdGMjRVcjluQ3ZILVRybTk4VTZ6cTRSaXRqYUhjdkd3WE1yMVJNUFE9PQ==

ive got two immediate problems with your opinion the first is that you like many others ive seen are still characterizing the focus on biden as being part of some media narrative as someone who was already concerned about him watching that debate performance and how hes responded to it has been a jarring experience not jarring as in i cant vote for him over trump now of course i still can jarring as in holy were going to lose the election its not the media who time and time again comes to sow division within the ranks about the guy its vote blue no matter who voters the ones who start shouting it before we even reach the general election that cause the problem what is it exactly that youre asking of the media that they simply gloss over that the sitting president appears to be suffering from cognitive decline just admit that you dont want them to report on what theyre seeing you want them to be team biden the second issue i have is this the candidate youre hanging onto isnt winning youre asking the media and the online community to be quiet but to protect what exactly hes been losing in the polls since even before this fiasco and now were supposed to ignore the fiasco so that he can win how does that make sense youre asking people to be quiet so we can win im asking people to get louder about him so we can win we both want democrats this year at least i know youre an independent to win but i dont understand why you think protecting president biden is the path to that the media coverage is mirroring what people saw people arent mirroring the media coverage,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZ2VjbkIxQ1RITE9OaFMzZ3R6N2xtaUY5ekJKQVJWVngwOWtiampRaFBaQ0NpMHBGSmlQd1BEalg2aWZWNzdxVEhjU2RCeW1PYXpHTEJKdWcybDAzTm1QUEFqd0EteTdUcU5aT3ZHYkdfQkE9

um no thats not what i was saying at all but first yes the media has been all in against biden since the afghanistan pull out which was the end of the honeymoon the constant reposting of the pics of a helicopter reminiscent of the fall of saigon in viet nam and saying this is just like viet nam was editorializing not reporting and not the reality and i still remember them saying with utter assurance how there was no way wed be able to get x number of people out then it happened then not x number of people out then it happened then not x number of people out and then not only did it happen but it was the largest evacuation of a country in history and crickets no acknowledgement they were wrong all of them onto the next scare gas prices out of control next scare were heading for a recession next scare which was true but not really in bidens control inflation and always always in the background dating from years ago biden is too old hes senile hes about to die always this has been ongoing they have been highlighting every gaffe and misstep omitting or lighttouching good news when it comes by contrast ignoring heavily trumps everything rotten about trump but treating him like he was always the presumptive nominee like a rapist an indicted and now convicted felon a man who abused his presidential power and tried to overturn an election is a normal choice for a candidate as if everything is equal this is not the media playing for democracy or the truth this is the media doing what it always does gin things up so they get clicks from all sides the horse race the moolah the well now were back to how i was saying what you are saying about what i was saying is not what i was saying at all i dont want the media to be team biden i want them to report accurately not constantly put on he saidshe said pundits and well have to leave it there both sides do it journalism i hate trump obviously but that doesnt mean they have to be mean to him its just if they are reporting constantly about bidens mixing up names why is there absolutely no coverage of trump doing that and he is doing that constantly if they are going to report about a debate or a press conference instead of focusing solely on how one person performed they report on the accuracy of the entire facts not just name flubs and in the case of politicians what exactly their policies are bidens age and his performance might be unpopular talking about hannibal lector and sharks and electric boats ad nauseum is not a kitchen sink issue to anyone and ending roe spurning american allies and talking up dictators planning to subvert democracy is not popular but all that is passed over by the msm but more about biden mixing up names please one last thing about that when trump was president even on npr when something bad would happen there would be a lilting uplifting appraisal and how that was just going to be a glitch and it could be a good sign including covid when biden became president every little last thing was harped on gas prices go up literally verbatim youve all seen the gas prices theyre going up again gas prices go down either crickets or but that could be a bad sign you telling me the media hasnt been harder on biden is going to fall on deaf ears here you are not telling the truth and also i am only asking for a level playing field not what you said for them to be team biden and now the greater point i am not telling anyone not to talk about biden or to not talk about him poorly i dont want people to be quiet about him or whatever i also want people to get louder what i am talking about is people the people at the top and redditors i guess just throwing in the towel after a bad performance at a debate demanding he step down or aside for someone else especially when they claim it is because independents wont vote for him they and you are wrong if they those dem leaders and pundits can see how he performs at a debate no matter how scary and go wow that was a bad debate and is he okay then that is logically what they should do acknowledge the truth but dont go flying into fits of unrestrained hysteria if the man feels he can do a good job and those in his administration feel he can continue to do a good job then whatever any top democrat or george clooney feel about how he needs to get out because it doesnt look good and he isnt electable as if they know can fuck the fuck off that is pure opinion and trepidatious gazing into a crystal ball not reality it is fear you say hes polling poorly hey guess who polled poorly in the last number of elections democrats and yet they have performed very well dems we all need to get behind the guy with a great record a great plan going forward has the chops for doing the chief executive job if not the spry stage performer and feels he can keep doing the job if he stepped aside on his own volition i wouldnt bat an eye to support whoever is there but democrats and celebrities lining up to bash on him to get their faces on the camera is doing nobody any good and they could be using their power to say yeah the guy had a bad night hes older but he can still function in the role he has been doing for the past three years and is campaigning for and hes vastly better than what is being offered on the other side right now we are not talking about the achievements of his administration which have been landing recently which would propel any other candidate but whether he mixed up someones name despite everything else in the speech being fine and logical and accurate and how that makes him unfit for office for this election i am blue no matter who but what the elites in the party are projecting is its blue no matter who but if biden is in hes going to lose because hes totally out of it thats not projecting positives or strength that is projecting weakness and it is simply not the truth that is their fear anyway that was my point not what you were saying was my

listen if i mischaracterized your point i apologize it was a huge post with lots of details i wont claim that i didnt miss specific nuance that changes the character of your point that being said i think we still disagree on the broad strokes i think youll acknowledge that arguing over media treatment is a black hole because so much of this comes down to who youre watching there is so much media even just on the major networks so your experience of what the media has been doing could be quite different from mine im still of the opinion that that the media has not been antibiden as a whole and i dont know what people mean when they say trump hasnt been getting the negative attention he deserves coverage of his civil trials and criminal trials have been all over the news for quite some time eyepopping headlines about how many lies he told in insert any trump public speech have been published by almost all news sources but the most right leaning like fox for years and thats the despite the fact that he really shouldnt be getting as much coverage and scrutiny hes not the sitting president biden is again its a difficult point to argue because it depends on what youre listening to i just dont agree with your philosophy on how to handle president bidens current situation and i think its coming down to the fact that you just dont think his current situation is a big deal you say you dont want people to be quiet and you dont want the media to be on bidens team but you characterize much of whats being said right now negatively you think much of it is hysteria because you dont think his current state is a big problem if you did you wouldnt think its hysteria as far as your point on the polling i dont think the polls should be disregarded because there are instances of them being wrong in fact havent they been wrong in trumps favor the past two presidential elections hillary was up lost biden was up pretty significantly in <number> if i recall correctly and it ended up being a nail biter how does that bode for us when were actually down this time anyway i apologize again for any mischaracterization,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTmZiUmtjZ3JHbnBMaWQ4TVpTY3lxWnIyTFI0MzRvd3RPRHFTWHBsbVJ2R1hfdW1TS2hsREo1aDY4NVFGNFo4V2szdTRHb2dLMHZQZmgxaTJ6cW1md2phNGZhY2cwWVItMVQ1QkVkeDV6cVE9
no prob yeah i tend to write a lot it does look like we are differing on our perception of him also maybe the perception of the job i very much feel this modernday change to the presidency that the president also has to perform for the audience is a terrible addition it does not accurately reflect what the actual job is just one side aspect of it ironically it was probably fdr who hid his crippling illness that helped bring that about with his fireside chats on top of the kennedynixon debate to make things shortish in another post i related how i have someone in my family who is older who worked as a nurse for most of her professional life she has always had trouble remembering names even and especially those of her children when she is bobbling for a name she just throws in a made up name that nobody has and laughs and we know who shes talking about by context or she points to the person as she has gotten older that has gotten worse but that doesnt change the fact that she still knows about an encyclopedias worth of medical facts and other things and we still turn to her for medical advice and would trust her more in that capacity than someone in the family who can toss out peoples names correctly at the drop of a hat so that is part of my experience and why i dont see biden mixing up names or getting a little fumbly when speaking which he has done for decades as a problem even if it is happening more often he still know what is going on and can do the actual job this is my opinion i dont know polling is getting kind of nebulous and a little off one way or another people are a little more savvy right now and for some reason with the meaningup of our culture enjoy trolling and fucking with other people so im not trusting the polling necessarily and can only be moved from pessimistic to cautiously optimistic although tbh that this race is close against trump of all people and not a complete blowout already is disheartening he is not for america nearly a million deaths under that callous oaf didnt prove that,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMFRQTTdIYlBBZmxuejVaZ0J6UDJDbWI3UDdlRS02V1pVVGQ2Wm5ZX0dCTlhib3RmM1pQMWMteWNYSGhVVHhQU3E4WGtmVEFmLVBIVk9tTzFEUkhSX2c9PQ==
first a minor thing you are not an independent you are a dedicated democrat this year i cant blame you for wanting to say youre an independent because the claim gives you more credibility but it just isnt so i cant blame you for being a strong biden supporter either trump is worse than biden for that matter trump is worse than reagan with alzheimers looking back reagan wasnt that bad i was particularly charmed when he had a private conversation with the russian premier and agreed to nuclear disarmament then his handlers told him he just couldnt do that he was sad about it so was i if only hed had enough clout to do it anyway at this point it looks like trump will win biden looks feeble and anybody they try to replace him with at this point looks worse all that dedicated democrats can do is soldier on do their best to win anyway or mayve put their efforts on the congressional races senators and representatives make sure the gop doesnt get a filibusterproof majority in the senate or any majority at all in the house disapprove anybody trump suggests for the supreme court we can go a few years with <number> or <number> supreme court judges like ajax fight intensely while on the defensive the democratic party has dealt us a bad hand it isnt that easy to get a candidate who can lose to trump but it looks like theyve done it a second time we need a good housecleaning throw the bums out reform the party but then thats really a job for dedicated democrats and not for independents like us,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLTExTFJZajgtUFNBcUlsVkJ6X2VxQnN3VkxwXzVRV0JjNExMOFdYOGszd1g0QmJDT0EwWEc1ZXJxbEtPdFNJRTJ3Q3BGT2lLU0hUcGU0MWFmbkpBTmc9PQ==

quite simply i dont think our democracy can withstand another trump presidency i would vote for a grainy vhs tape of a pile of excrement drying in the sun if it meant keeping trump out of the white house with that said biden has been a pretty decent president and is heads and shoulders better than some pedophilic felon with a bad hairstyle i dont understand why were even having this discussion and it scares the hell out of me that it has gone on this long,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUTFrZUpWdHNjTC1tUVFLbGgzLS1Ed2Z6Tzd6Sm5BYWc5STZxSHdvaXFaR2xTT3VRaDg3RnFrQWYzbndjc3V1X2lqejg2NHM5WTNyZlFKZjhhU0xyd1E9PQ==

too long didnt read i might have had more agreement with you before that debate it was truly frightening and for the first time i began to think that he cant do the job well enough now let alone a couple of years from now dont get me wrong hes been a great president maybe the best in my lifetime but i have worked in the aging industry for a long time i watched my father suffer serious mental decline i know what i saw because ive seen it many times before id vote for biden on his death bed dont get me wrong on that either but now im leaning towards finding another candidate as disruptive as that would be another candidate could bring the fight to trump and drive a pointed and disciplined campaign message im sorry that being good at running for president doesnt necessarily make you good at presidenting but that is the world we live in im there now if he can be replaced he should be what that would look like frightens me but im willing to roll that dice because i believe now that joe is very likely to lose,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbGpZVWZSd0FQSE1XLTVTeGFqc0w1dVYwa3hFM3BmNVhRcVJVNnFzbnJqVVkwd2VyQnNpVnhNT3BQaVY3Z1g4RVNsYlNKY3VSNHg4Y1hhWmFuMEktVnc9PQ==

problem is that we ignored that technology determines practically everything from rights to even how governments function were also in a time that outstrips the bronze age in terms of complexity and after the bronze age collapse civilization hasnt gotten that complex until recently so well going to have to take a step and reevaluate the interactions between technology and everything else i mean were almost to the point where a small gaggle of people with more ideology than sense can grab biotech capability and unleash sythplagues for said ideology and thats just the beginning,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOHRELUhoMkdlS0NYdHRCTlowdS1WcUJQQmNFSUFoMHpKQnpFd1AtdVMzbnQ4aWxEdnVXS185cjB1MHhnVHpWdUlIYnJ6dXJ2ZTJfRHVZcVU4SEdnNWc9PQ==
okay well thats your opinion i have family members in their <number>s who are sharp as a tack ive had family members who had a hard mental declines dementia and alzheimers biden is not showing any of those things i also have a family member who cant remember names worth shit even her own children and its been that way forever and only getting worse as she gets older but is a fully qualified though retired nurse who has an encyclopedic knowledge of healthcare and can administer it and give advice like a whiz even if she isnt the best at speaking sometimes or gets names confused she can still do her job this is what i see in biden so i guess our experiences differ and thats where our outlooks come from contested elections for an incumbent has always meant they lose this is what the republicans have been after since he was elected mcconnell had said they needed to make biden carter and it has been that way ever since anyone new they put up will immediately have all the unelectable problems that one half of the dems worry about or the other and will be amplified by the republicans and the media but if you and the other dems decide to roll them dice just understand this was based on your belief that he is very likely to lose which is based on fear polling data which hasnt really budged actually and the msm pushing and pushing and pushing that narrative,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS1M4RnVqb2h0cXVURjZpNEVJSEYxWjlHQUlFMUV2MlQwbG42Nm1Dc0pyTjQ2dXg5SHpZUzZJNnRQSVpia2JYU0RZeTU4eG1UUVhad2JoR2JoLTVFZ3c9PQ==

people in their s who are still mentally sharp doesnt disprove a thing i said but if you and the other dems decide to roll them dice just understand this was based on your belief if joe runs and loses we wont know if candidate switch would have given us a better outcome if another candidate runs and loses we wont know if things would have been better with joe you gotta make a call and live with it by the way prior to the debate i was the guy defending joe and his age to other dems new information has changed my opinion,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQXo4d0c3TVItbEZITUpXZ3VMeF8tS3l4cWo3TDhTRzFBRHJQYmFmY0ExdDlVYUlpV2RJU3B4M1hNUVhtakw5OWpvQ3FNNjAyRUVSMFc2Ul9KdHR6d2c9PQ==

i know people in their <number>s who are still mentally sharp doesnt disprove what you said clumsily i was trying to make a contrast and show there are many grades to things more to the point were the people i mentioned who i knew who were in hard decline also the people who have the same characteristics as biden stumbly trouble mixing up names which has always been long term who are still fully functional that was my point anyway you are right we will never know new information can always sway me but we are obviously processing this current new information dramatically differently i just see a guy who is goof prone and stumbly and can dryup at times when trying to express stuff not a loss of what is going on or losing his grasp on reality but we differ on how we see it ill be voting blue whatever the case so lets see what happens i guess,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS0YyVWRoeExua0Q4ZzhWUEhQS0pvcEtqdGoyVmhXMEVkQ3Y0cXNfdnh3Q3NfckhTSXZCRDAyc3AzOTdRVFhuOWkxUURFaTQ3UWJkQ1RVUDE0REFPSUE9PQ==

so theres no real problem but democrats could create a problem by dithering and angsting about bidens brain issues it mostly doesnt make much difference the president has a lot of advisors who tell him what to think for example every day the intelligence services give him a <number>page report about the world it will have a few sentences about various developing problem one place terrorists are fostering public discontent and arranging for mass riots and the usa is providided nonviolent technology for riot dispersal another place freedom fighters are organizing the public against an oppressive government and china is selling them weapons that are primarily useful against their own people every few days the president gets a little more information about who the enemies are and what they want and what the usa can do to oppose them so when some sudden crisis reaches the news the president already has the background that he absorbed with no effort early in trumps first term he announced that he wasnt going to read that report and it caused various shock waves if it had been some other president i would have liked him not getting brainwashed that way with trump i didnt know what he believed already and it bothered me that he wasnt getting the background so anyway it doesnt really matter how well biden is thinking because he has a whole deep state ready to tell him what to believe and he doesnt have to think at all,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYR3JmYnRlSWhBZ1hhdUVhSGF3S0QzLWlJa3dtcXE2V1RaUXpHQU1mb0xiVWlDYjVBNm1hMi1CSFNfX1FMS1o5cEl6dTN3RDljNE52Q1czNkhvQ2s3U3c9PQ==

i see the op listing problems but not suggesting solutions i dont have any solutions either i see the underlying problem as a particular corner of modern technology each of us can live in an information bubble where the only facts we see are those that support our prior beliefs not only can but is pushed to because algorithms see what we like and feed us more of that we may each have different values and different priorities but govt policy requires that we reach some sort of agreement the founders thought that in the long run rational discussion would win the day but rational discussion requires that we start with some common facts because we cant prove everything why are republicans according to the op so intent on getting their way that they are willing to throw democracy aside it isnt personal profit it is fear of the alternative crime waves immigrant waves attacks on religious freedom attacks on white males all based on facts they see in their media feeds why are democrats so scared of rs in power another list of fears coming from a different set of sources we literally cant agree on the basic question of whether there was massive felony level fraud in the <number> election people get their facts from different sources we can try to chip away at the problems that these information bubbles create but i dont see how we are successful in the long run,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTnA4dkoxMW95cVFBWFFablRFcmFEQXJZWjFmZWlXTU1Cak1BUDJXWnZQUmtKTGZldVQ4Q2E0bWtFNGE3Tmgtc01aTE4yV3hHTndjcFRjak8yaWVXRWc9PQ==
you ask where do we go from here we desperately need great big reforms which we cannot make happen the legislature is deadlocked we cannot get prosperity without some adequate alternative to oil but at the moment our giant corporations will not create that alternative and the government cant make them we had something vaguely similar in the <number>s rich people could get whatever they wanted cheap it wasnt bad for them to have a lot of people out of work and a lot of people living cheap when they could have whatever they wanted lots of great big mansions were built then with cheap lumber and cheap workmen etc is that where were headed now theres plenty of oil to keep the superrich having whatever they want just not enough for the former middle class to have air conditioning and beef and things like that maybe the solution is a great big conventional war like wwii but different maybe for example we get into a war with iran and they damage <number> aircraft carriers and sink <number> of their escort vessels and damage many more suddenly we arent ready to fight wars all over the world and many of our allies desert us or try to go neutral considering russia and china china stops exporting to us and many nations that do export to us raise their prices so high we cant really afford it we desperately need to refurbish our military but we depend on those imports we depend on imported fossil fuel so we have to make great big reforms and we have to make great big sacrifices food rationing gasoline rationing etc very little consumer air conditioning limits to home heating we wrap up in blankets we get new recipes for our beans etc the legislature doesnt prevent reforms because there is no alternative tina how does the war end i dont know its often hard to predict before a war starts how it will end but for the duration all of the old obstacles that prevented us from being ready to win a real war will be out of the way the profit motive banking profits environmental regulations medical costs for civilian medical care anything that interferes with the war effort will be pushed aside and if the war doesnt end in defeat we will have an economy thats capable of prosperity afterward for the survivors who got through with minimal medical care and a limited diet etc,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUDVCNnc5Wlp0VGhBc19sS0JiTUhaa1hoRU8tTndLWEp2Z2RRYnF1RGEtZGxKUmNuLWZJb3NCaDQxbTZVbHhFRER3eXJPREhDVFI5bkdhZ2l1UXMwQ0E9PQ==

thank you sir for your diligence vigilance and concern for the future and freedom of the united states you are exactly right that the republicans have turned their backs on the fundamental inherent natural rights and liberties of the american revolution and western civilization they are coming from a place of hate politics christian church and state ideology and principles antithetical to americanism republicans are attacking immigrants and desensitizing their base to immigrants pointing the finger at immigrants blaming immigrants like the nazis did the jews donald trump has repeatedly expressed his intention to end birthright citizenship which grants us citizenship to children born in the country to immigrant parents in may <number> trump renewed his pledge to end birthright citizenship for children of immigrants in the country illegally on his first day in office if reelected in <number> the constitution states all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside the republicans have waged a war on the constitution and our freedoms and this is one of many attacks on fundamental freedoms this country embodies in fact trump is preaching communist racial theory and nazi hate politics when he says that immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country you addressed clearly many of the other freedoms and principles the republicans are waging war on i shall not address them further foreign policy however is something which effects the united states of america greatly and must be addressed foreign policy is the area of greatest concern and consequence to the nation right now more then ever and republicans pose a threat to the future of this nation never seen before freedom is declining globally closed autocracies have increased from <number> to <number> countries globally with <number> billion people or <number> of the worlds population living in dictatorships nine countries have become pure dictatorships including afghanistan chad guinea haiti iran mali myanmar turkmenistan and uzbekistan the number of dictatorships has surpassed the number of democracies with authoritarian approaches to governance becoming more prevalent aggression is increasing with russias invasion of ukraine chinas threats and aggression near taiwan and in the south china sea irans attacks on israel and aggression by other proxy terrorist groups in the region north korea is becoming belligerent and is exchanging support to russias war in exchange for long range missile and nuclear technology the good news is that america is standing strong supporting ukraine the united states is rebuilding alliances and working to preserve the peace right now the us is winning and the prospects although challenging are bright america needs to be strong right now more then ever weakness appeasement isolationism will only lead to war i will not predict the hypotheticals of how things will go moving forward but i will say what i think the only way forward is first propaganda is everywhere and must be confronted with real information people need to learn to think and check information instead of believing what they hear the information war must be won because right now propaganda is effectively demoralizing polarizing and dividing our society we need to take this seriously and launch government programs to address this challenge programs like radio free europe the big picture etc secondly we need to educate americans with our actual history and the basis of our principles and their importance to humanity thirdly america must address the economic crisis in this nation we need to confront the monopolies and predatory crony corporatists and banksters and their influence in our politics and government we need to address the centralization of power and wealth and bring equal opportunity and fairness back to our economic system the feudalist system is perhaps our greatest weakness fourth we need to address the health crisis in america fifth we need vibrant leaders which represent the interests of the nation and the people to step up willing to pay the price and bring integrity back to government we the people need americans determined to restore principles integrity and freedom to the nation to step up and recognize the responsibility they have to the nation and take action,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWlBGYTU2b0tRX0VHc3VYQ1BXRkNvNDRlOTdZNXo1WGVGMmh1Um9fcnRKSVFzbWZsajJiWEpzekFudFFNcTV3aVlWcEViNDFGSnBiQnVmanRJelItZFE9PQ==
i understand the reasoning that the us coming out victorious in wwii led to prosperity and a strengthening of american values but if we went full authoritarian then got into a war and won wouldnt that just strengthen and enable the already inplace authoritarian establishment i cant see how that timeline would possibly be a good outcome and lead to mass prodemocracy reform,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLV81WWhwZ1RfcVlqQzRrblNEX2tRTC1aV0VFUWdqUEZ4WEhPN1VMQXVtUk05TFl6YzB5Wk5Db2dGb0pYUllCSkVVY1BybzVNN05zLUhVM040Y3VLOHc9PQ==
the right is not the problem it is the solution the problem is that authoritarianism isnt right or left but everchanging it goes where it thinks itll win if we simply continue to vote left permanently those in control of the right will simply switch back to the democrats especially as those on the left continue to swing further left to oppose evil on the right on the bright side this can be not solved but temporarily fixed for a few decades through the one thing authoritarians hate unity through democracy and freedom but that involves bringing the centerleft and centerright together not pushing the right further away leftists will need to compromise and step further right to pull rightwing and conservatives back into sanity bear in mind all of these are negotiable not all the options and dont need to be to the letter depending on the person youre reaching for accept limits on abortion and lgbtqia+ rights allow christian principles to take more prominence in the country abandon ideas like reparations and crt especially the demand that they be mandatory protect gun rights and speech rights instead of putting more limits on them limit illegal immigration especially from central americamiddle east cool it with the antiwhiteantimale rhetoric stop encouraging crime and start promoting more nuclear families theres room for concessions for the left too but if you want to pull conservatives from the brink you have to make a genuine effort and make serious short and longterm changes to the platform politicians and way we see the world one of the best beliefs the right have is the belief in opportunity we still have the opportunity to make things right its not easy and it wont be popular to most leftists but the right way is not always the popular or easy way,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmhVdU41a3daNmQ0eUpwdEtRNHZrQUl0NWpsN2xvNDBNUkl0RXF0M28zOUpnTmVTUHZ6MzhlRW9jbm5nSUFJdE1jVTdlNHdJWUY3SFNHQzFKdXBjWEtNUmI4X1J1ZGNBZlhrQm40RzdKTTA9

thanks for your input i wholeheartedly agree with every one of your statements things would drastically improve countrywide if everyone became more educated and we started to regrow the middle class however and forgive me if this comes off as negative or pessimistic but i just cant see any of those things actually realistically happening the corporations that control politics and media in the us have too much to gain by keeping the general population poor uneducated and acting against their own best interests the only way i could possibly see things start to move in the right direction is through something like an unprecedented <number>+ year run of political wins for dems and things going well shifting the overton window back towards the left i dont know i could very well also be part of the problem in not really believing significant change can actually happen at this point i am pretty naturally pessimistic but just my thoughts,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQllwSzk5cnY5LVFWWkg2UGpaMkNhN3p0Z2dfODF2Vko0RDdiM2NTdmEzZW05TGFRMkpIMHRhTzYzTC1QVDlkbkh5azNTRXlYU0g4Q05hLXJFR20xM2c9PQ==

while yes i totally agree that information bubbles and echo chambers exist and have detrimental effects on compromise and reaching across the table i think the effects are way more amplified on the side of rightwing extremism where the fears that motivate republican voters are substantially more irrational inaccurate or just blatantly false i think better education in rural areas would certainly be a good first step in remedying this but republicans typically act against increasing educational resources for the public presumably on purpose to keep critical thinking skills low,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYdndyRnFMcF9acmRvVWNRZGgwcG5ONVlRN2MxZUllNjkwdUozTzFkdUNVSjQtQm8wSGo5M0E0b3NuUHhjNGdCY3I3WGg4ZmxET1Zrc3k0TGUybkZPN0E9PQ==

i hear you but in reality their are some very good actions being taken but well see how it plays out its just that people dont really hear about this stuff in recent yearsthere have been renewed efforts to enforce antitrust laws in the united states the antitrust division of the department of justice and the federal trade commission have taken steps to address concerns about market concentration and competition in <number> the doj filed a lawsuit against google alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the online search and advertising market in <number> the ftc filed a lawsuit against facebook alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the social media market in <number> the doj filed a lawsuit against meta platforms inc formerly facebook inc alleging that the company had engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the social media market there has been increased scrutiny of large tech companies such as google facebook and amazon due to concerns about their market power and potential anticompetitive behavior the government has taken steps to investigate and potentially regulate these companies to ensure that they are not using their market power to harm competition there have been legislative efforts to strengthen antitrust laws and provide more resources to the antitrust division and the ftc to enforce these laws for example the american innovation and choice online act which was introduced in <number> aims to promote competition in the digital marketplace by prohibiting large tech companies from engaging in anticompetitive behavior while there have been some challenges and controversies in the enforcement of antitrust laws in the united statesthere are ongoing efforts to strengthen these laws and ensure that they are effectively enforced the government is taking steps to address concerns about market concentration and competition and there is increased scrutiny of large tech companies while i dont think this is nearly enough it is a start likewise its important to educate the public about the real causes of inflation instead of the mindless flinger pointing when in reality their are many cause not least of which was covid and the war in ukraine i am somewhat pessimistic but i also see reason to hope for the future in reality this nation has been through far worse as bad as things are they are much better then people realize when you take the global situation into context the united states has had the strongest recovery among the g economies as measured by gdp following the pandemicinduced recession other g economies such as the united kingdom and germany are still performing below trend overallthe us is taking steps to reinvest in manufacturing and supply lines with a focus on building resilience strengthening the middle class and making things in america again the us government and defense industry are taking steps to rebuild the industrial defense base investing in research and development to improve domestic production capabilities encouraging businesses to enter the defense space or expand their capabilities strengthening the domestic supply base through initiatives like title iii of the defense production act developing a force structure that mitigates risk and a budget that pays for it all in all their are major changes and investments that are going to be felt over the next decades as america modernizes and advances its just that right now we face challenges and global concerns its also true that whenever things get tough people tend to listen to anyone promising change and that is the danger,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS0F6dll3WlZ5N3NWUXB0bGV5al8xbGZUM213WmFMUWdFaE5tamxjR0NRS2VNWTlSVy1XNjRVWDl4OVcwbkxMelN0MzQzN0ktNGNFRGkwbmZCUllmUWc9PQ==
you could easily likely be right if something happens that turns the society upside down and shakes it some i sure cant guarantee wed get a demcracy out ofr it something about this reminds me of a nasrudin joke it goes nasrudin went to the mosque to pray but he saw right behind him there was somebody he thought was a thief so he didnt take off his shoes the suspect saw he was wearing his shoes in the mosque and said prayers with shoes on just disappear into nothing but nasrudin ignored him the thief repeated louder prayers with shoes on just disappear after the third time nasrudin replied yes you are right but i hope at least the shoes do not disappear if we can go from what we have now to an actual working economy that allows some actual prosperity thats at least something even if we stay stuck with an authoritarian government,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUmlRMVJMeVI5QnRwT3lIVVVhRmd5MHU5eHdrYlp6MW1LOFktLUlIMTlWVTkwRmtYanpGZFB1UTlHaFpaN21mQ0FQeHJCdk9IVDgyc1pBMlN6eGl6d1E9PQ==

one thing is certainly true the conservative messaging media is very effective when a strong majority of republicans still believe that trump had some sort of massive vote fraud against him when none of these claims have upheld any close scrutiny i dont believe republicans are stupid people but i just dont understand anyone falling for his clear lies yet again,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY1M5NXgtSlVMMjJCbUZJeW9BYmZYY1ZOWUtJRU5mWGZCM1VCUEFwWjc1anhqb1pqNkxTN2RfM25PTnByUmdQQjlHYklvam45V250SVZmdEdZMmM0WFE9PQ==
that is absolutely true imho but right here in this election there is one side that is still democratic enough so that we continue to have elections have to start small but find a way to work some viable nonfptp election system that allows third parties to be viable and get it into action not forgiving but the dems are suing to keep third party off because they believe credibly that those votes could pull votes away from dems as a third party voter until we have a new system that makes third parties actually viable in elections all third party votes basically pull away votes from one of the two viable options unfortunately,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeENZR0E2bDZ2NmdBZ2JSeHRhRzVjZm9uZnQybHc0ZFdyWWpzY1NqYXNnX2RKUlUyNmplTEdxSU9DUlRDb2QtbnY1OW9OMHllSlltazhUNFl1MDJuakE9PQ==

um while i agree with not loving dems for their antidemocratic cynicism they have been doing much better this go around than to say they are failing to govern though hamstrung by a republican house scotus and defiant state governors now is rather impossible but i think your thinking about a military coup to spur people into action is a little utopian thinking and unrealistic susan sarandon and others had the same idea in <number> have the republicans take over and do their damage and people will look around and change things for the better the damage was done we are barely recovered from it there was no sweeping change,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaDg3US14OUYwNmRuQ0JkUVFUSFp0VnpyVm9BRFkyb1M0ZXVwalA2di14VlFyRVV5aG1JOFNDaGg1YXdWUlhaS1IyTi1lU3BrUWFoSWJXTF9vcmRXZmc9PQ==

i appreciate the thoughts i dont agree biden had the luck of sucking at that debate he was everything during those <number> minutes that people worried trump was everything they feared it was bad but it was an anomaly it forced people to assess what they were voting for and yes there was a pile on of people saying he should go based on those <number> minutes so the pile on forced a slap back from voters and from a base that recognized that a biden is still a very intelligent guy who achieved a whole bunch in very tough waters and b people like the media and george clooney are not going to tell them who to vote for in the end it is going to be biden vs a very damaged donald trump with his project <number> anchor i am sure that people will vote for biden i think its unlikely that the dems have the stomach to push him out harris is already on the ticket if biden is as feeble as some people think then shell be president soon enough as for any other replacement its going to be a shit show i cant think of anybody who can step in and not have a dozen arrows hitting them in the ass out the gate im sticking with grandpa and know hes filled with piss and vinegar,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcy1VZW5UQWpRUjJlWmZDTWtOR1U1TjRUSEduekt0QUtUcE14X1Qxb085ZXc4Mi1aVjhBX3BiTnViX3haa2NBR2dWbllYZjdUZVZJQzczcTl1YVRPRXc9PQ==
the one thing i have learned is you never know who would win until all the electoral college votes are counted you can win the popular votes and still not become president think about that nightmare trump wins the popular vote but loses in the electoral college we would never hear the end of it regardless the best thing anyone can do is go vote nothing is set in stone until it actually happens,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZclB2c1RBakpNbEpwVE0tQlkwcUFSOFpEUWJOamp5c2RDUERYd005MlZlbWxweUhXOW9qYTNuLU1LdEVmeGItZ1dkQlpNUGlrMHN2YXVxNXBVTERWX3c9PQ==

so i just meant doing much better as in legislative and substantive accomplishments for america the middle class and carrying through with campaign promises etc etc what is happening here in this election is not what i was referring to if you read my original post you will see that i agree with you though i will say just like all the other pseudodems that reply to me im an independent i really dont believe that trump is ahead he might be looking neckandneck for the electoral college which is what matters most of course and doomed hillary but he is not this raging populist like he was last time sucking in dopey dems and suggestible or disgruntled bernie supporters i was a bernie supporter but didnt fall for trumps lies and bullshit and voted for hillary,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa3pneHRsM2s5T21idjFiY3RPTEg0S1BlOFdlcjA3NG1ITEtxSm9YVG9Kc2YzU2ljUGhzT1NZUjVJenZmcXRsRGtkR05uWEd5NTItamNaVFN5bFA0UFE9PQ==
> they have been doing much better this go around than to say they are failing to govern though hamstrung by a republican house scotus and defiant state governors now is rather impossible so you are not disagreeing > the damage was done we are barely recovered from it there was no sweeping change we have not recovered at all and we havent hit bottom yet but were close to bottom biden announced an economic and ecological recovery program which wasnt <number> of what was necessary and recent events in ukraine and israel show that to keep our existing international goals we need to at least double our military budget again were approaching <number> of gdp for healthcare the obvious solution is to cut off more people from healthcare so they die and stop affecting the statistics but thats no good we need to find cheaper ways to get good results but he argument is focused on keeping benefits or cutting them fire finance insurance and real estate is about <number> of gdp and rising how can we possibly afford that but who are the campaign donors i dont see a coup as any solution it just looks increasingly inevitable more and more people recognize that we dont have a government that can function not something we can fix by incrementally voting for more democrats in red states increasingly its turned into people like you saying we have to vote for democrats so we can have democracy and voters look around and say what democracy and we have to vote democrat to protect the constitution and we look around and say what constitution and we have to vote democrat to protect our robust economy and well say what economy and we have to vote democrat to protect the middle class and it will be what middle class,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX3JzbTNKa0FPRTA3X2tpWGFJV2FnVlF6d1owX3piXy1NY1RmN2VPcllMYVo1dEVqSXZKVmtHT2VWSEdhdnpkUmg3TER2cXVYNzBjTU9jc3h0R0MzMlE9PQ==
id really like to see your sources of this i understand the nazi regime and its rise to power and what they did id like to know what you find similar and what is factually similar im not being sarcastic im actually interested bc so far a google search is doing nothing but showing he uses similar rhetoric by no means do i believe trump is the answer nor the best option in fact both our options suck both of them are divisive for our country people are too focused on who is president rather than making actual changes,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZENsUF9wZEw3N0FScjhNR0Q5WWZWUVNYLTNRS2hkWmFETkJhNUZneGJGaU9NYzUtU2I0M2tQYWVJN1VOTWFPaTc2bnBzd3VLTTZtN2kxSnFpT1hGT00tTEhfcmg0V29JMGdNTEZ4dXREOTA9

i am not disagreeing that without democrats in actual power by having a majority in the house and the senate and the presidency at least they cannot get things passed now by not voting them into power their agenda which is better than the republicans cannot go through okay so did you not see the legislation that helped bring down pharma costs brought down child poverty improved the infrastructure brought manufacturing jobs back to america that the unions which are the bluecollar middle class jobs have been championed by biden where he was actually walking their picket lines and helping in their negotiations that people not making <cur><number> or above has dropped from ~<number> to ~<number> have you really missed all that those were actually good things the states and scotus aided by trumps rightwing supreme court additions who wouldnt have been there if people had voted for hillary in the swing states worked together to knock down the roe vs wade ruling and are chipping away at womens rights voting for a democratic majority they would be able to put roe into law that isnt good i dont know about the statistics you listed but look allowing republicans power the situation all over the place will get way way worse getting democrats in failing having a decent progressive party that is electable will at least get what good can be done hey the democracy is us voting i cant stand all the times ive heard idiots say obama want giving them what they want after they stayed home when voting time came and the republicans took over both chambers of congress you need a solid democratic majority and in this case if republicans get in there might truly not be a real democracy where people vote for their representatives im not sure what you arent seeing here maybe you are a burnitall down guy im not im a get what can be done then move forward always forward burning it all down and expecting a utopia afterward is magical thinking people will just be stuck in a worse situation positive man or maam positive,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYnJUTFU2RHpBM1lTRnFMZjRTUzJvcW91SE1vZHFCMlhXb2w4WnFMNGNibDJxNzBLb0dnZDBydU5pdDZyNXJfUEJHcDVWMElaRk1MbmtuS1hfdi1IeWc9PQ==

im hoping i can bring some clarity to where we are and how we got here by simply saying racism misogyny and homophobia the modern republican party reagan onward is nothing but a huge backlash against the social progress made in the s and s by blacks women and more recently the lgbtq+ community that is around the time that black people were suddenly allowed in white spaces including schools women were suddenly allowed their own credit cards the birth control pill and nofault divorce please remember that right after these changes the following things occurred the republican party turned against government government is the problem ronald reagan even democrats had to get in on the trend the era of big government is over bill clinton they have since that time been against virtually every policy that might materially benefit average americans in any way evangelicals suddenly developed strong feelings about abortion no really they didnt used to care at all the nra went from a gun safety club to a crazy gun rights lobbying group <number> look it up and weve been living with that backlash for the last forty plus years then more recently a black family lived in the white house for eight years and gay people can get married now the time is right for someone like trump whose only differentiator was his open racism and obvious misogyny that was his appeal and it still is finally sopmeone is going to defend our precious way of life read white supremacy and patriarchy and now the current chapter seemingly is this movement is enthusiastically embracing authoritarianism and minority rule if its the only way they can get what they want when someone says trump supporters are forgotten middle americans who have been left behind economically tune them out thats a cover for racist sexist white people who have been watching their preferred social order erode over the last few decades and are at a breaking point,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcVZZampWT1h1OTFVRm9wQjlmY1U1dTV0eThqXzVXckpTZXBkZmV2aTlCSXIzcEVxalZBVWljaFNzWjIxY2pLNUhFRkxOTURWbEpab21LS3l5RGNzRHc9PQ==

when a person fears for their life or the lives of those they care about do you honestly think theyll wait for their opponents to make the first move that makes sense to you you mean to tell me that you would actually sit around and wait for armed gunmen to not only surround your house but to start shooting at your house before you start shooting back are you familiar with the concept of preemptive strikes do you understand when and why those are employed in matters of war i ask these questions in a rhetorical sense really just to highlight how blurry the line between defense and aggression actually is you want to look at this issue on a microscale likening it to a situation of two armed individuals facing each other the law dictates that in situations like that one person must reasonably fear for their life before taking lethal action only then can the first shooter claim selfdefense otherwise its aggression that same concept does not apply to the political stage it doesnt apply to assassinations i promise you if you metaphorically dissected the minds of every assassin and wouldbe assassin throughout human history you will find that just about every single one of them believed that they were defending something or someone the senators who stabbed caesar believed they were defending the roman republic from the tyranny of caesars growing power john wilkes booth believed he was defending southern culture from the tyranny of northern abolitionists gavrilo princip thought he could defend the balkans from the tyranny of austrohungarian rule in their minds meaning on a psychological level they were all acting in selfdefense andor defense of others your inability to understand this notwithstanding when the nra tells people that their guns can also be used to protect the american people from tyranny people will connect the dots on their own they will start to believe that they can defend themselves by assassinating political potstirrers before they get a chance to become oppressive its simple human psychology why wait until that person is holding a gun to my head if theyre saying thats what theyre going to do ill just shoot them before they get the chance why take the risk so as i stated in my post regardless of whether he was right or wrong thomas m crooks deemed trump a tyrant and sought to defend america from a hypothetical trump tyranny you trying to split hairs between defense and aggression in matters of political assassination seems to woefully misrepresent and misunderstand how people think and behave shame,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnY0xsRmZYYXdTMG9lOFpmOUd2TWdzRnJhRllra2FIckhFY0Y2LU1tRkJYSHhqUi01a0l1MnAxRVNqdmlqa0lubXp2WmptWnZqcDNyNW45MXVkS3JuWlE9PQ==
yes yes good guys who are acting in defense resist the urge to attack premptively the line is not blurry if you really struggle with the concept go take a concealed carry course it will help you to understand so that you dont look silly despite your claims most normal people do understand this concept even nra members thats why though there are hundreds of thousands of gun owners in the united states and a large percentage of them feel that our government is trending tyrannical they arent attacking their government,r/politicalopinions,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZnc3dXBoelBjeGJjcTRtZU83SEV3MVBjRHBvX1B5RWdSZjdhUHpaVDdEQU5TWm5FYUZzTUVVVnc5S21LOTFpVHZ0U2VTaDAzQUd6ZENURHFhcnpSY0E9PQ==
