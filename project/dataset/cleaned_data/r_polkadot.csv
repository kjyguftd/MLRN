staking is per year instead of giving to you one bulk price they give it to you throughout the year since price is volatile so from my understanding <number> divided by <number> which is helpful in the long run for example you have <number> bucks in there next day you have <number> so youll get <number><number> of that,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTV2ZfWFN6WjJzazdiZWw3M2N2RzZ6ZVdhVG1VdkNBWUN6c3pnQTRDeEtMU1I5dmR5dkJ3N1ZqLVJTdDNDc2h1S3ZiRTZYTk5OSHJqUDhxNWZwZG16WEE9PQ==

giotto is not a person with a different view hes a greedy manipulator who uses ways to defraud a system for his own personal gain the only positive from giotto is that he has shown open gov to be too open for exploitation at present its shown that if youre not paying attention to the continuous proposals in governance then it can get manipulated and theres no retrospective action for slimey sheisters aforementioned i dont have the knowledge of how they can protect against this but this is far more than differing points of view chain analysis a multimillion pound companyasking for <number> million dot to pay <number> staff a ludicrous amount of money a month it not passing its ref vote and then being proposed exactly the same again through root tracker im sorry thats more than worrying for one of the core principals of dot governance,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaFlmaXp5dmczamdINEYyS0dyUzBKTC12TmxxeU5XR2RyczE1MHYySGxjM1ZUR2dfZmEtN0dmaC1HWjVnb2hiTms3SVlRMzlXeDBQNDdfQ2FjZks3ZWc9PQ==
to be honest i think the drama on opengov is one of the unique selling points of polkadot polkadot is the only blockchain infrastructure capable of having a fully onchain governance system that can produce this level of political drama we should emphasize and encourage more political drama as it could be a good method to attract attention in a world where content is abundant good reputation or bad reputation in the end the only thing that matters is whether people are thinking and talking about you and your product,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNnp6VlRHd1BpVnFIZ3lYVC1PdE1WclNFYWVlWFpsTnkxTUowRzBsWC1wdkkxZVh2MHRNYmEzUjFNVXp2Q1c4LTlCY0NWSzhKSmxQcWxMeHROVFBTdXc9PQ==

thank you for your answer usubstrxte  to what extent do network fees reduce the rewards if you always have them paid out or if you stake them again why didnt you mention fearless i read that the former fearless dev team is the current one from nova fearless now have a new team what is the qualitative difference between fearless and nova today,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUURsLTlXa3FfWmd1TnJON0J0WEw5UDQzOGZ0NWNIbzkxZmR3c2RMTVdNZFV4b1dSeUFLbmFtTEJtWHFDOE1TTjI1WjhEWVczV2hmak1rRnFJNVVxNHc9PQ==
nova ui is just hands down the best in my opinion this is no fees on rewards only if you trigger the payout action yourself which you shouldnt do let somebody staking k+ dot pay the fee for you no fee whether restaking or paying to account i was the one that made the post with the fearless information basically anton and nova team built fearless wallet and then left to develop nova and other projects because of disagreements,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbkxzbFVzNzQyVHpmeFNMLVVYU21leXJSWVFJOVctbVF3NFF0ajBFVVl1Q1F1Q0x3bmNleEtEVUYtZ0lyTXgybEZvSGxkb1RlMHdmNHoweXdmMTVGQ2c9PQ==

polkagold the premier digital reserve asset for polkadot in a visionary interview on <number><number><number> dr gavin wood the cofounder of polkadot expressed his desire to see the polkadot treasury hold assets beyond the polkadot ecosystem diversifying its portfolio this sparked the idea of creating a digital commodity akin to gold a reserve asset that the polkadot treasury could own yet hosted on an entirely different blockchain polkagold aims to become the premier reserve digital commodity for polkadot filling the gap left by the absence of a true digital gold that underpins the economy as a reserve asset for the treasury to acquire the polkagold advantage while polkadot already boasts native stablecoins like usdt and usdc on assethub for stable currency transfers and the dot utility token for transaction fees governance staking and network security polkagold offers a unique proposition as a noninflationary digital asset polkagold will have a fixed supply of <number> coins produced at genesis ensuring its scarcity and value preservation this novel concept seeks to mimic the fair launch of bitcoin where even early adopters had to acquire their coins through mining a fair and transparent launch polkagolds launch is designed to be the most fair and transparent in the crypto space since bitcoin with <number> allocated to the team <number> allocated to founders <number> allocated for marketing <number> of the supply dedicated to exchange liquidity polkagold launched on exchanges during the early bootstrap phase with the entire supply immediately put into circulation as part of the liquidity pool this innovative proof of purchase pop concept ensures that every single polkagold in existence had to be purchased just like the early bitcoin adopters had to mine their coins the synergy of algorand and polkadot polkagolds security is provided by the algorand blockchain chosen for its exceptional security track record exhibiting zero downtime zero failed transactions and zero onchain hacks since its inception algorand was created by turing award winner silvio micali widely regarded as the father of modern cryptography while algorand boasts a large community and focuses on enterprisegrade usage it has yet to find widespread adoption among mainstream cryptocurrency users polkagold aims to bridge this gap by driving strong usage for the algorand coin bolstering usage on algorand dexes total value locked tvl and <number>hour trading volume mutual benefits for algorand and polkadot the appeal of a fairly launched noninflationary commodity like polkagold in the current global landscape is undeniable by bootstrapping and locking the entire genesis wallet liquidity exclusively on algorand dexes and algopgold trading pairs polkagold creates a virtuous cycle <number> to acquire pgold users must first acquire algo coins <number> if not already an algorand user they must open an algorand wallet likely pera wallet <number> users then trade their algo for pgold increasing tvl transaction volume on algorand dexes and demand for pgold <number> increased demand from more users drives further acquisition of algo coins perpetuating the cycle this flow perpetually drives demand for pgold bringing new users to the algorand blockchain and creating a snowballing demand for algos native coin as well as increasing tvl and transaction volume across the algorand defi landscape for the polkadot community polkagold controls two wallets <number> a wallet on algorand that holds the genesis wallet for the <number> hardcapped supply lp locked for <number> years and <number> years respectively <number> a wallet on polkadot that has locked out the ticker pgold the name polkagold and the asset id<number> the elementary number for gold ensuring no copycat token can be created on polkadot this whitepaper grants ownership of the algorand genesis wallet to the polkadot treasury which can be claimed by the web foundation official twitter account or gavin woods official twitter account by sending a dm to the polkagold official twitter account upon contact the private keys and seed phrase of the genesis polkagold wallet on algorand will be handed over securely and free of charge to the polkadot treasury as the algorand and polkadot communities acquire pgold it becomes a more distributed commodity and any value accrual will benefit the polkadot treasury which acquired the genesis wallet at no cost however the polkadot treasury wont be able to sell or access the pgold until the lockup periods expire a winwin for algorand and polkadot polkagold aims to bring together the combined liquidity communities and market caps of two major bluechip projects synergizing to create the hardest and most fairly distributed asset in crypto pgold its a winwin for both algorand and polkadot as it synergizes their communities bringing together their combined users and trading volume for mutual benefits the polkadot community benefits from the value accrual of pgold while the algorand community benefits from increased transaction volume algorand coin demand and dex usage both communities end up with a communal digital gold that can open up new defi opportunities and pgold may be used in clever ways by other projects within algorand and polkadot that have yet to be conceived there are far more applications for digital gold to be explored,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRkxud1Q0VFFVSFJMLXR5SHNMWkNKTi03RXpXRWtFeXhkZkdrX0xjVUpWVVhkaWtjY0ZDcHhFd3ZTcnZpaTRzNGV6X3d3bllGbGxpR1FKeGJncGRwTGc9PQ==

a similar idea is being tested in kusama our team created kreivo<url> a chain for daoscollectivescommunities as it was treasury funded its a native ksm chain it has opengov but instead of using the regular token voting its governed by its daos that form a ranked collective each dao has its own governance and can participate in the general governance of the network where voting power is determined by rank the more commitment it has with the protocol eg the more infrastructure it provides to the public or the bigger it is the higher the rank we believe this can become a fairer way to distribute power benefiting those who remain active builders with the best interest of the network at heart instead of giving tremendous power to a few just because they happened to be early to the game so who knows maybe in the future if a big enough number of diverse communities join and this form of governance proves successful this system could be proposed to be expanded to the entire network,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVk93ZzczaDdSTXVSNUVYS25KMG1nUXBkak5zc09uX01rRUJsMVFCRGNuOTVBLWloTmlWN2RfUVMzUlI5V2FjOTZLYjlnbWRScDFEcHFrUTNHM19BOEE9PQ==

i agree it shouldnt be a complete linear mapping of dot to votes there should be some sort of power curve quadratic for example and i also think that staked dot should have more power than unstaked dot might start getting a bit complex though but it just maths so it could easily be boiled down to wallets having a voting power metric which could displayed pretty easily,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMzhhbnZ2YUhnX2pwUVNveWFmeGhzeXNZQ19CVTJCTzlZcm1WSXd4ZUNreGREdElaUF9TNC0zY3Itek5mYXRCbzRZLWRyNVlWWFBuQ2Q3eDFrSHVTNXc9PQ==

not too long ago i considered doing something similar by building a website specifically for us potential holders and showing ads about the polkadot wallets on youtube and their staking rewards to noncrypto users in the us the preproposal was not very well received by the community so i am not going forward with it i think what you are considering is a great idea good luck,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTU1lUnY2Z1hnQ056a2FSVGpYckhLa2twTU00MVRYTDNSSTBRS2F4M2M5VGxOWGVUOXRGRVNsd0ZIN1BOdUtuOGtFTmhHb2RMRk9keC15OUVkTEFjbF9seHBpYWFJeEptUmxGN19HTjFMNzg9

iopengove is working very well what would you like to see the papal model with a congregation that defers to a dear leader reality is that if you get <number> humans together they will find things they dont agree on we just need to reach consensus an agreement on the path we are taking forward for polkadot no matter what happens some people will always be unhappy with it opengov is allowing us to reach consensus an agreement but it will never be able to please everybody all of the time,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcWpzMjVoNUxUSGJGblJWVVBmcDVabHdLbUZsOVlfZzdWZ3hGTGNQamNFdVNkd19ud2gxTV9maWpZRi1oSlM1Q0hMZ2lLcEVhSjJmODRoczZESXZfclE9PQ==
tldr the author brenzi argues that opengov on polkadot is plutocratic and unsuitable for web governance they propose quadratic voting as a better middle ground between plutocracy and onepersononevote democracy quadratic voting balances the influence of capital and personhood but requires sybilresistance to prevent manipulation opengov will fail because few individuals decide referenda making most votes irrelevant and leading to resignation and lack of representation possible solutions for sybilresistance include stateissued ids for kyc biometric identities social graphbased systems eg brightid and pseudonym parties inperson or virtual,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQXFQVEFpb2xZYksya2lsdVZzRzA2QmpiWl9YQTlGSEZ6NXNIUHJnbzRQcEU4VzFiTEVsdnh6aEFrc0wzUUdqR0I4N2ItWUxIZGRMMUZHamRkRFBybGMxcVVWNEVSWkJud1lhZlJoaFlUQkU9
the only way to fix it would be to make everyones identity public on chain and have a voting system similar to real life and your social security number however this destroys the idea of anonymity it might be possible to have some kind of process that is able to talk with exchanges that have our data can verify we are who we are send back a verified tag directly from coinbase for example and attach that tag to our wallet make it where only verified wallets can vote but not sure anyone would really want that,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSlBVQk9Rc3VQYmh1YTF3WVVpSE9zeHByWlN4bkVtc3VHQUJGbkxXeVUxNXU3RkJHUkFlUEJ3WWllaktMdnNjZWZIYm5OYnIwTWEzdmRqRmRDV3AwSlE9PQ==

so in a nutshell there was an interview with the kusamarian in it dr gavin wood said the polkadot treasury should have a diverse set of assets that are not in the form of dot or kus and would like to see commodities such as traditional gold etc from there the concept of polkagold came about built on algorand because of low transaction fees and speed the coin came out as a fair launch everyone had to purchase <number> for the team just like everyone else meritocratic the premise of this project is that the genesis wallet will be gifted to the polkadot web <number> foundation or dr gavin wood himself for  so polkadot can have the diverse set of assets in its treasury now if and when they choose to reach out and receive their pgold the genesis wallet will have lockups ranging from <number> and <number> years in the vaults that i listed for you to check out on vestige this is it in a nutshell i hope grandma enjoys,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcW54NDRibWtUNFJPdlB3akp4b0xfVDAxZEVUZWMwd1cySk1FMVlrNlZtSkJTV0RLczdMN0pMck1UTW9hWU9iUk5uYkh2WWMtV3BBeEIxLVRJMlQzdUE9PQ==

by enough dot being voted on nay in the last <number> of the decision period time which would then make the whole thing rejected i think youre overthinking the text there keep it simple its very intuitive if you dont overthink things and read the words for what they say not sure why you even say is not intuitive to be honest theres text there to explain for you if the proposal will get approved it will need to be approved by voters during the decision period which lasts for <number> eras aka days otherwise the proposal will fail the decision period is how long may take to get this proposal approved and moved into the confirmation phase it is very difficult to fit the two sentences above into the ui especially via a tooltip iconography so the text there does it just fine in my opinion what would you change about it to make it more clear,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVNy1iMDZGOWU5UmpabHlfMXYwU2FPR2pPSlUwdnFHQWZoQ1RzLURsejlQbFhXYXhhMzhLMlE1cUgtNy1tdXUzUnRJOXVqSHMzdk9OWEtORW80b09zeWR4ZkQ4NG5NWmVyNGRvQ2EwTWlfcFk9

assuming that you have your pink in an evm wallet like metamask or talisman evm you can go to beamswap <url><url> and swap the xcpink for xcdot then go to moonbeam <url><url> make sure you are under crosschainparachain bridges tab then connect sender your evm wallet and select the dot moonbeam chain connect recipient your substrate wallet polkadot make sure you have enough for the network fee and click send it should bridgeconvert the xcdot into dot and store it in your polkadot wallet this only works with talisman subwallet and polkadotjs,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjcklKN3g3NVc0UkkxSmNHNURWMk84SjdaQkxNZG0xNHJGdTRlSkc5VkpzazZpakJDeUQ0MkVxaFplNWpPamZSZXJDWmNySGxkMHEtdE5VdWl1Y2NtYWJkejJGM21hR1ZzRWlBRWw3VFhEZnM9

i hear you the thing is pink was originally released on moonbeam which is more evm and less substrate this means its more ethereum than it is polkadot i mean he can skip the second link if he has no problem holding dot in an ethereum wallet <number> dot is <number> dot regardless of which wallet it is in hopefully the polkadot snowbridge will make things easier when it comes out because it will bridge polkadot with ethereum without an intermediary like moonbeam,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjRXd5YXdiaUpQSHhXVEYzRlRoRmZRUXBJZ0dxTmFCd0pkNUZ0aVlEM3RTVmJNTWtsUHJ4YndhbmRBMk9DZmpiZFpxYXB4RGNyTG02c1BYNVJUamVBbUVuZElXM200YnZiaGhxOHdYVkxjWlU9
the issue is the bridging xcassets between chains in my opinion having to move your xcdot to the relay chain is unbearable even for someone whos been in crypto and big into all defi since <number> assets need to work on any chain without bridging this means the bridging needs be done on the back end when a contract is executed the analogy is like saying i need to swap the money on my debit card to a specific debit card for every store i go to its not realistic for retail or institutional adoption while this isnt a perfect example the analogy fits in the context of effort needed to interact inside of anything polkadot,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNUxhbUIzSFBldUdpaFVVeE5GYUVSamJpc2d3X0YzWHFDbzJUUlBpUTJ0NHRvdlJhTnJOUzV6UWxXY0NyOFQzSU9wMjFHM0lmVVplSFZOZVFUbnQ5YkE9PQ==

its really not that complicated the actual answer is on moonbeam via stellaswap dex or on hydradx or on base via beamswap or on polkadex all these <number> locations support swapping pink to dot which is what ops question is everything else is just how to get your dot from whatever location you swapped it on to polkadot relay chain but that was not the question which op might not even want maybe they want the dot to be transferred to bifrost ps you seem to describe sum up the issue with multichain networks rather than the issue with polkadot the same issue of transferring assets is present in any other ll systems the ux issue in polkadot doesnt actually exist using a noobfriendly ui like talisman for example is easier than using metamask i understand your concern even if i dont fully agree with it but painting this as a polkadot problem tells me that you either dont use the easy uis or you dont use other multichain networks,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjVE9Oc2pRTnoxRnVzVHZFODNDeDBMUlNWblprZU02YUYzbG1TQVJLellwcS1ibUpOaUpUSHEySHc3T3FyTG5pN05qcDJpS2xORE10SV9sbzJZUWlhMmd0b2hlbXA1RXpvZlNEemg0U05aMTg9
the issue is the bridging xcassets between chains in my opinion xcassets are just native polkadot assets bro transferred via xcm its the same token but called differently on moonbeam this is a moonbeam specific denomination made in order to differentiate from assets bridged from other networks since moonbeam is an evm enabled chain and the expectation was that assets will fly in from other evm chains imagine in your head each time you see an xcasset that you cant read xc theres no swap occurring its the same asset maybe that will help you in some way transferring xcassets is the same as transferring assets via ibc in cosmos and more secure than transferring eth from l to ls or transferring sol from solana to ethereum via wormhole or etc etc etc is your problem just bridging in general do you want just monolithic chains and lastly your analogy is completely weird on top of being inaccurate when you transfer an asset from chain a to chain b is like transferring usd from bank a to bank b in scenario in which bank a is not supported for your transaction for whatever reason the solution to the problem of unnecessary transfers for endusers is the same in web as it was with banks = increase interoperability either directlynatively or via middlemen enter visa and mastercard the ability to transfer assets via backend when contract is executed to quote you exactly already exists on polkadot and it is in use on some parachains projects just need to use the tech lol not all of them do for example you can perform defi actions on acala by using dot on moonbeam with all bridging occurring in the background all in <number> click this fact alone kills your entire argument and narrative of a problem of polkadot,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjU1o3VE5PaHNEaG1tQjR1cWc3cHFxa25OYWE0emt5MUhENGxQT0xKTnJZSHhJTjRGT0ZoQjltRkNCRHBWSVozNVA5enlPYkdMSDFPX0pGZmhKeVNzaFZRT3lsWkVFXzhTV0h0dXZQV3VHTUU9

yes i have been reading about this event when i said importing the funds in another wallet i mean import the <number> seedphrase of the respective signners in a new software wallet to move the funds all that i find is it was a parity bug just after i saw that this is not a common adress but a smart contract wallet with a bug such a great ideia mainly without audit or testing before receveing +k eth so basically is burned eth linking another question its impossible to recover the funds without forking the chain i found a gavin wood interview in the internet cant confirm if is real and he was asked for this but refuses to give a anwser just getting of the topic,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlc1lsVWNKVzZWUHBheU9jUTZXRC01NkdUMUtsSTI5ZlFkRXRpeVhibUdWelY4V1kySzg5cEtsMVZVYXRWa1M2bmZDUF9UYzBqX1VKSWd2V1o3VmZZb09uM3hsS1IxclF5bmlWWnBsY1BvbGs9
when i said importing the funds in another wallet i mean import the <number> seedphrase of the respective signners in a new software wallet to move the fund this would not change anything onchain the problem is with the smart contract code which cannot be modified accessing it with other wallet is like you having the wrong key for your car and then making a copy of the key to get it to work its impossible to recover the funds without forking the chain i found a gavin wood interview in the internet cant confirm if is real and he was asked for this but refuses to give a anwser just getting of the topic correct a fork is necessary this is what eip<number> was all about which was rejected by the ethereum community see <url><url> i dont know what interview you readwatched but web foundation was very upfront about what needed to happen to recover funds see <url><url> such a great ideia mainly without audit or testing before receveing +k eth comments like these do not make you come across as a neutral observer just trying to gather information especially when people are going out of their way to explain the problem to you when you are asking very fundamental questions about how blockchains work,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVldlQU0tLVNQOGU2TmZjRmJqTy01TVR4Z2NlNXpTWGpqNVg0VzJKc3ViUXVxMldSUW01eGNMWHFGbWZIWUluVVg4NVpGRDJlRl9FbFFGX3JOQ1oxQUE9PQ==

despite ledgers recent controversies theyre still one of the safer and easier staking options if you have a large amount of dot you could take an approach of splitting them up between different wallets to mitigate risks around storing them all on one wallet if youre comfortable with storing decently large amounts on hot wallets then nova or talisman are likely the best options at the moment i still use ledger for a large of my staking despite their multiple shit shows since i trust them more than cexs + hot wallets and its easy enough to use with <url> for hot wallets i use nova when doing swaps and using dapps on other parachains etc i also used to stake on nova and my experience was great back then edit it seems nova has gone fully open source so thats also a huge plus much of their team came from fearless which used to be a good wallet after i experienced multiple glitches and unstaking issues on fearless i switched to nova and the experience with them has been much better,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQ0N2d3VJTG1yT3QzSnF2MlhldXEwTG5OOGYyNmZXWUxpX2dJRERBekQxWkpyTThIQXREcUlSa3pJZzBFR1EyTGFGYjQ0WUNwR01OdnUtcUh3NTJ3cWc9PQ==

cool thanks for correcting me you or someone else can correct me again if im wrong but i think their transition to open source was more of a recent thing sometime over the past <number> years i think they had a treasury grant in order to fully transition in any case its good that theyre now open source either way theyre a really good hot wallet from my experience i still wouldnt store a huge amount of crypto on it but im really impressed by nova,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtS2VGeG5pLXlmb2tobnZ6U0tUYnRmcXgwSlludU1OZFkwTnpJNUxuUWREUVJ4TGRFZWRZbGRHMHFJLWl2cEpfOEZQcl80WHZQMmp6cVRiSFJzZVlyUnc9PQ==
its a bad idea because you get fewer staking rewards since coinbase takes a percentage you dont get airdrops free new crypto that is sometimes given out to dot holders and the biggest reason if coinbase shuts down you can lose all of your crypto holdings with them that happened to people who held their crypto on voyager so selfcustody is always the safest,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtUm1jMW5FRTFCaUtQYzJtRW5mUWdUODFBQmVuZ3BwQk5DR1FsclZJNkxMT2JSbXowRzlSNmE0UG5wd2VVMlg4aWhYeDNMS3lvRW1VWUJjcGVmWWl6REE9PQ==

just so you know most of these questions are already answered on the polkadot wiki <url><url> that is always the best place to go when you need a question answered the governance treasury is a lot of dot locked and the proposals are the only way to spend it yes its a special account on the network governance opengov is actually the only way to spend it but in practice this is generally done via treasury proposals a subset of opengov referenda you can see the account here <url><url> any token holder is able to submit a proposal even with <number> dot slightly more than <number> dot for transaction fees and a submission deposit but yes see <url><url> for instructions the voters receive some reward for doing this no reward is given by the network for voting on proposals some proposals or other referenda include people rewarding people with nfts or other rewards but this is not necessary the resources from treasury are for maintening the project alive like funding new projects its for whatever the dot holders think is useful for the network this includes things like marketing block explorers wallets events etc you can take a look at the previous treasury proposals here to get an idea <url><url> where does the dot in treasury come from mostly transaction fees and staking efficiencies but theres a detailed description on the wiki here <url><url>,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuN194elFFRUh1MlltRkFvQktKbTB4UmVzMHQzeW1CX2Y4WDViMmpuRkNxQ05rWTFMNzVHRWxJOFBuck5wT2p2VTc2S3NJVjlhQXFGc01JbnJ2dXM5cmc9PQ==

techwise theres only a few other protocols attempting to accomplish interoperability with the security that dot offers i get the sense that near is trying to become a underlying os layer that bridges web <number> and web <number> as well and they seem to do a better job of generating value on the price side they have the advantage of aligning with the ai narrative this probably wont be a popular opinion here since most people in crypto are tribal but i hold all of dot near atom and many other cryptos anyway my main concern with dot is on the financial side since i agree that the tokenomics and demand drivers are still a huge question mark atom suffers from a similar issue and theyve struggled with generating value for atom while having arguably worse security than dot i will say that i much prefer interacting with the atom ecosystem though i agree with folks that the ui ux is severely lacking in the dot ecosystem but some hot wallets like nova talisman do appear to remedy that a little another big question mark for me is the lovehate relationship i have with open gov conceptually i like the idea and i have been participating in most of the votes however it pisses me off when influencers get a large amount of dot from the treasury im sure a lot of this stuff goes on behind the scenes for other cryptos and its just more in the open with dot since you can see the proposals and what amount of dot theyre asking for i know that some shitty proposals have been shut down successfully by the community but we still have a long ways to go anyway despite my concerns dot is still one of my largest positions i dont plan on selling until the next altseason heats up assuming it comes,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVkFDd0JDYmNaWTVvdkRBa2NfZGc2Qms4aGpQek9RbHNxVzBoeEtIUHhaZE1XU09yb1RvdXQwdkpCZF9CMWZZWWJKVEh4Z2VkbUQyZDVRVTltVGtPUFE9PQ==

polkaswap is not created by paritypolkadot its a separate project built on top of a polkadot l parachain more specifically sora network polkaswap and sora are created by the same team called soramitsu with the ceo and cofounder being makoto takemiya you didnt really describe what the issue is but sounds like you lost coins while bridging how exactly it doesnt seem to me like you even know who you want to sue and why ps polkadot is a public blockchain which means that if someone knows your public address they can see the activity of that address and if someone more knowledgeable in crypto than you looks at that data it might look like they know more about what happened hence appearing incriminating even though you both have the same amount of information available to look at fyi some food for thought,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvQzNNbzFkTFlPSFBsclhrb0FYblFoVmEzeGQ0cmNXRVJhaWhCRjlpRVE0N3hqX1gxZzAyRV9RMGpzWlFaUkZhOXNGZzhHT0s4am5uVlpzMFE4WXNHLWw2cDZwRnotamZWZ0tsaHBNelZsRlE9
unfortunately composable is going the wrong direction more and more centralized coming from someone thats been a crowdloan participant and been following them up until i participated in their mantis restaking for sol bridge launch what was supposed to be trustless bridging turned into trustminimized which is just marketing jargon for not trustless bridging much like their main website changing from trustlesszone<url> to apppicassonetwork<url> they chose to start building on substrate because they admit its the better tech then pivot to pushing ibc since it was easier to create a marketing narrative around it instead of xcm and slowly moving to cosmos ecosystem from polkadot then changed narratives <number> times while in cosmos ecosystem and then now jumped on the sol restaking hype after missing the eth one due to internal restructuresdelaysetc i no longer believe in their vision which changed and rebranded way too many times already these guys pivot more than an nba player or what theyre trying to sell their initial pitch and vision even if they chose to go with ibc as the messaging protocol was what was attractive instead now they have a tech stack thats a combination of trustless and centralized customizable bridges which makes the entire thing semicentralized at best and that really doesnt differentiate them from other products out there eg axelar completely taking their whole usecase being the main reason why they switched narratives to restaking oh and to answer your question yeah i tried it it didnt improve my life at all even though im in dot eth and sol ecosystems lol,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYllyX0ZPLXc5MEFSYld0c25tRHVIeGphLTJ0NmJUMm1wWnIwTXEzX29vWXNLY1FFMDN6YmFobnFEUnlrek5Ua0xyS1hEZ2djUUtSa1pDSjVwd3FmSm5RUGducGc1THNrME5FTnRmeHRta009

im sorry to hear that youve had a negative experience it can be disappointing when a project doesnt align with its initial vision or when changes in direction are frequent however its great to see the insights youve shared based on your firsthand experience and observations change and evolution in the blockchain space are not uncommon and projects often need to adapt to market conditions and technological advancements while its understandable that these shifts can be unsettling they can also present new opportunities for growth and innovation its important for projects to listen to community feedback especially from contributors like yourself in order to continuously improve and refine their offerings i guess the blockchain ecosystem is vast and diverse so there may be other projects out there that better suit your preferences and align with your expectations exploring different options and finding the ones that resonate with you can lead to a more fulfilling and enriching experience in the crypto space thank you for sharing your perspective and i hope you find the projects that truly enhance your journey in the ecosystem,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bUpMREVUT2NBNWFQeFg2eG5XTWlJeFcwbjZKOV94cW1ycjFVV2dqb0ZCMUdpT09hRGlaSTJjNHRtZmNuU2xqUkFYcklOUHpCWUdmRUotTGw5T2xxN1E9PQ==

loved polkadot then started listening to robert breedloves what is money videos now i simply see inflation as a non consensual tax inflation just debases the value of something over time the only way to not get debased in any pos blockchain is to keep <number> of your asset staking and if <number> of it is staked what utility are you really gaining from using it the obvious alternative is liquid staking but then thats no better than our current fiat you simply use an iou of your asset and getting away from that setup was the whole reason i fell in love with blockchain,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4U3Y1MFVNbHJlbDJ2dzZVR2FpalhWMTZiX3NCSjllUU9JUU9Fc005enFLekVlQ2huTjRlU0lnTkYxQmxWeURHRUNLZF8yTVR1cWktTS16LWxEZkJGbFE9PQ==

yes dot debases by ~<number> a year yes cash one person takes out is cash another person puts in value is subjective if you believe the narrative that the future internet must be decentralized and that polkadot is foundational infrastructure for that then you probably conclude that dot has a very high net present value that you are willing to pay for because the price will go up and you will be receiving a high yield on top of that if you believe crypto is fundamentally a ponzi scheme intended to hoodwink morons then you would probably arrive at a different valuation,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bWpQZElyUjdhaXZHeXhPU2UwZDFPRHVxVzZ4cVBTWkJBUDJ3WFdFZ2Z3QmJJZDhwa3hxUUZuTlI5TUVGdDlkV3BDTXN1QU9VMEx4eER5LThvTS1HR2c9PQ==

doesnt matter at all if the inflation is happening for valsnoms to get rewarded i think its a pretty fair tradeoff unlike irl where inflation happens because muh banker has decided to print cash for you to get in debt the productive purpose of inflation is pretty necessary and worrying about it is pretty irrelevant its not like polkadot has much varying price action or liquidity variables anyway,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4RUstOXByYmZ3dTd2S3RQSUlaSzZHMjIxeTFrbnVnZHVWd0pDSldPT01pZTd1RjVOZ3Y3X0xPcXc1SXk3TzI0clJKZlpldllGTDV3M1ZaZklVR1VES3c9PQ==

i gave up on polkadot a long time ago staking was and probably still is too complicated to understand for many in polkadots defence most crypto projects have failed to deliver any kind of useful utility despite the endless development and partnership announcements if this bull run fails to lift even a handful of alts out of their depressed state its likely to set crypto back by a generation or destroy most of it forever even bitcoin has hit a wall and despite the continuing inflows enough people dont believe it can go much higher and are selling in equal volumes,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4REtwelItUk9pempGdkZmYXNCX2hPNWxXNFFiWFlJNDVQdlZTYmpGZXZlTDVvV29EOXlyOUMyZ1BhaHduT2JkLVdSbWRnNzVwVVBLUkh0RzhnRkVubHc9PQ==

i am not a expert on the economics of crypto including <cur>dot but what i have gathered is the less there is of it and the more utility it has the more its exchange value is <cur>dot is <number> down from its all time high for almost <number> years now and while from a conventional investment point of view its appreciation in its price sucks but i will argue the value of <cur>dot is much higher and is extremely undervalued polkadot has been off the sec radar making a claim that <cur>dot is not a security it is a utility corejam will create more value when it matures because now <cur>dot is required to fuel the cores of polkavm occasional burning of <cur>dot tokens keep the price in check and staking is the only real way to earn cash positive yields i guess <number> is ok but it is like robbing peter to pay paul i would like to see the inflation to adjust to <number> or <number> so yields would produce move value when staking but i am still unclear on inflation and deflation and how it works or doesnt work in the crypto economy,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4dzN6ZWlEUlVKbWFnWFZJNnZIRlBJNC1XSjJUQVQzVjRhdV9oUkptLXltZXpuV3hWQW41U0l5S1NTWkdBSDlwSUZ1Q0Z2emtleGkwN184bGJVWTFuZlE9PQ==

as somebody that is moderately computersavvy and pays attention enough to manage most things via internet it is absurd to try to move money between the absurd number of networks safely it is no wonder money disappears from peoples accounts many times its probably their own oops but it also leaves them hugely vulnerable to slimy thieves it is a tricky thing to just move money from an ethereum or bitcoin network over to avalanche or cosmos or polkadot if mass adoption is the goal then there needs to be diligent work from the upper powers of blockchain technology to police the scammers and the fake promotions of coin releases so many of these supposed experts of the industry seem to be bought and paid for by these scammers and fraudsters there are no real repercussions either it is very difficult to find actual indepth investigative news about the different companies you have to rely on their honesty and nobody seems to be thoroughly checking into them these are only my opinions i am a firm believer in what polkadot is offering and where they are headed will continue to support with my money and my voice,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5M2JicTlnSDZJS24zZWxsYXJwc203TERZTHQ0NldSajFkTjFrNEFNNWZ5ekV1UVNranJJWjVhaWZUOGllRmlQTnp1blRqdXFLcXJsS1VvZExOWU1NUVE9PQ==
more polkadot people should be on reddit thats one feedback lol honestly i think twitter x is pretty bad for indepth discussions first the whole tweet layout is terrible for lengthy convos and twitter blocks nonaccount holders from seeing whats up anyway plus people are usually highlighted there based on their following not necessarily the quality of the points that they make and its a pain to get a following which makes the use of personal twitters sometimes necessary which i think stifles the diversity of convo since not everyones into being notanonymous in a crypto community on reddit some total rando can comment and it can be upvoted or downvoted to sht doesnt matter if theyre wellknown or not and people wont know the person just the idea sure reddit has its downsides too but its pretty good overall and definitely should be focused on a bit more polkadot forum is ok but not really good for starting a big community conversation imo and way more techfocused than anything else aside from that we seriously need a polkadot defi hub where every polkadot defi app is listed on one website with total metrics being tracked like tvl daily trading volume etc defillama is not good for this due to their interests the rule structure etc itd be great if we had a website someone could easily load up and bam they perfectly see everything thats goin on in polkadot defi defillama is literally missing hundreds of millions of polkadot ecosystem tvl which is just totally unlisted atm making polkadot appear less competitive than it actually is this desperately needs to be fixed in order to attract more people into the ecosystem its like the most basic marketing thing we can do that doesnt even require a huge activation ^ edited cause i got my comment removed for bad words lol idk how but whatever,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VUZPLWF2TVJjNjA3eW9CSEt1YnoxTHptcEJoY0pYTTAzNkZZQ3hfdVFCN0l5UTVUbzA5NEZKNW9VZV8zY0tUcjJWbXBya0Q5cVF3NktqLVgxanVTRFE9PQ==

i left polkadot in september for solana i really liked polkadot the problem with it is the tokenomics they suck so bad the inflation rate increases the more people stake which makes any reason to hold it less attractive on top of that the token is useless and cant be used to buy anything on the network <number> days to unstake a token is also stupid everything on the network also feels harder to use than other chains solana is faster cheaper and easier to use why would i ever move back to polkadot the honest response,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MHZMdzZ3cnp0Tm44N0gzb2VyT1hJclU2aUN0VVg1c0Z3ZklVb1g1RzZCRW9FY3VBSmpVNXUtS2tVTTB4Wm9zSTdhd1RDOHJuYkxabUxRZlh5Q0YyNlE9PQ==

to each their own however the inflation rate is set at <number> it doesnt go up the more people that stake not sure where you heard that not sure what you mean by buy anything on the network but dot is a utility token which is used for staking governance and purchasing block space a <number> day unbonding period is there for a reason that is to give time to slash a bad actor before they act nefariously and just unbond and get away with it this gives us time to spot a bad actor and slash their stake it actually makes the network more secure and secure block space is the best block space everything feels harder because polkadot is a security layer its not a l like solana which is more akin to moonbeam or another l secured by polkadot this will also completely change with jam comparing polkadot to solana is comparing squirrels to apples completely different things compare ls to ls nor security layers to ls but again this will completely change with jam solana may be faster now | think multiple cores processing concurrently but can it handle the traffic of the entire internet like polkadot will be able to do is it absolutely unequivocally decentralized does it have <number> open decentralized governance can it be stopped there are many reasons to go back to polkadot if you understand the direction polkadot is heading and what it is looking to accomplish i would rather be a part of securing the decentralized internet of the future compared to trading memecoins and nfts for a quick profit there will come a time that you will be using polkadot without even realizing that you are using polkadot and you will be happy but like i already said to each their own ill also leave this here <url>,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5WFZpOTduWUFTLXhYeXQ4d05IMzU0UzAxbW5NeDd4eUFhNXp0aTBONlM1QkU4Yko2eXZkdDJZMUVLdjJVUGJpbVN1WGVJaEhvMkhScGNlY2dBdE9rSFE9PQ==

heres my basic ass understanding of it you know how third parties like coinbase allow you to swap your crypto well parachains like polkadot strive to remove the need for a third party like coinbase the technology allows you to swap directly between blockchains,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aEt2MEYtcTZsaDRieTFzNENwR01Qa1lFOTd4b0RkQnVhUXFjVmlvbzVDMEVPRW1kWXZTT0VqU3F2ZWROcmVHS09oSGJBak41VEQ1MWlhSjRyS1VvOGc9PQ==
okay i will explain polkadot is a blockchain for developers developers use the polkadot blockchain to host their own blockchains users then use those l chains and they function just like any other blockchain but they have various benefits due to being hosted on polkadot for example they are backed by much greater security than if they were independent and they are able to better communicate with other blockchains on polkadot the reason why polkadot isnt simpler is because it wasnt made primarily for retail investors it was made for blockchain developers first and foremost yes polkadot can benefit from being easier to use however someone actually needs to spend the time and resources in order to do that and that just simply isnt a priority because the priority will always be the developer experience and realistically developers are going to have a higher base level of technical knowledge than some clueless retail investor in the crypto space so what is the logical reason why we should dedicate valuable resources to cater to the needs of retail investors so that they can throw in a few thousand dollars hold and do nothing else and thats assuming they would even put in a few thousand dollars ive seen people throwing like <cur><number> and then calling it a day but what does that actually do for the ecosystem the buying pressure is miniscule compared to rich people and wealthy people presumably are going to know a little bit more about what theyre investing in and are going to take the time to do the research rather than expecting people to spell everything out for them and if we dedicate resources towards simplifying everything we are then going to sacrifice the other resources we could have developed like making a better developer experience which is supposed to be the number one priority i would take one star developer over a hundred meaningless retail investors devs are just inherently more valuable to the ecosystem besides its totally possible for people to learn about polkadot on their own thousands of people have already done it,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3OTVxZFhaUnhDR255MDdJLXBYYkttcmZWMVctUkg3RDVKM2VlTkVqZENZWWJTMjl3ZVhKSWNiVzRfS0ppenNOblpDTHJjbTJHSkJnYzAyTGVDZHdwWGc9PQ==

you are of course all welcome to discuss this topic and be critical of polkadot but a reminder that price discussion is not allowed in this subreddit personally i think governance is anything but unconscious at the moment with how much attention is paid to it im not sure what the op means by bureaucratism all you have to do is convince <number> + <number> of dot to use the treasury for something and there have been a lot of different referenda passed in different ways when i think bureaucratism i think kafkaesque rules and restrictions almost the opposite of what we have now but perhaps something different was meant by the word all that said i think nobody can disagree that treasury spending is currently quite high with outflows about x inflows,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aU5STXEyUmRVdkVVXzNMNVU0Nms0U1VHTl9EQkZKQWdVZmJWZ0J2QnJ4aU1Bcm4tYS1NcHVxVGtCbjlEV283QmljeDNHcVpkbElxSXdyVUU0TlFnU0E9PQ==

let me state unequivocally as literally the founder of the polkadot support team that these emails are not saying that you were scammed they state <number> polkadot support is not polkaswap support and they request that you reach out to polkaswap support for details <number> furthermore it notes that you have not shared enough information for polkaswap support to help you and lets you know what information you need to share the support agent asks if he can have permission to share this information with polkaswap support <number> the onchain data shows that your account sent some tokens and received some other tokens in the emails provided it does not say anything else about those tokens or what they represent additionally you did not post any links or transaction hashes in your message or any description of what you expected to happen vs what actually happened,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4ckJXN2c2eHZHaVJiRjltb18zcko4bHlTczhrczZkVmpkeEFVdlktQzRyaU5BcEZlNHI4b2VPdXJ6MkRzZURqQjExZlFFTmtSZjdwZy0zaEo3VWJYOXc9PQ==

liquid staking doesnt work for a lot of reasons for a lot of people here in the us you cant really do it because a tax purposes so all you can really do is on chain staking but liquid staking also has a ton of risk behind it in general if a project was to go under then so doesnt everybodys dot remember parallel finance this is a great change thats not going to jeopardize the security of the network while still allowing people to withdraw early if they need to as long as the network is in a healthy state there really is no downside to this change coming,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEdkZLVlJaNjlSZXJLd1o4NVh4VXgydjhLakNQSWlMZTNGenRpbkFLZ3BQb0RJbUVSc0dXLWp2RURVVmdjUFNGQlhNbVhCcmV6N3BjaHBPdkVXYnF1ZlE9PQ==

>here in the us you cant really do it because a tax purposes so all you can really do is on chain staking not sure why youre saying this but you got something wrong along the way in us liquid staking is just treated as another token so its a swaptransfer since the ldotsdotvdot is just understood as another property due to being just an iou token remember crypto in us is still treated as property asset in regards to the risk of depeg counterparty etc i agree with you >this is a great change thats not going to jeopardize the security of the network no blanket setting the unbonding period at <number><number> days as the op suggest will absolutely jeopardize security and pretty much ensure system instability after the increase of the active validator set to <number> which is coming up on relay chain the only way to reduce the unbond period is to make it dynamic and adaptive on a weighted queuing system which seems to be the direction that jonas from wf is going for this will not result in a <number><number> day unbond period for almost anyone sans edge cases it will simply reduce the unbond period when nobody else is unbonding and it will increase it when a lot of ppl are unbonding aka relative to whats in the queue >there really is no downside to this change coming read again above your analysis is inaccurate also to reiterate if the only reason to make this change is because people think the price will go up which is what op is preaching then i disagree with the change because the endresult obviously it wont result in a price increase ppl thatve been long enough in crypto have seen this play out before might have a worse effect on retail users than simply keeping the statusquo,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNET3A2OFB4a2ZRRzZXcTlncU5uWlRvS0tqdklkb05VcWFNdWpMc1FtUEZaeE00dDJWaEdsMlRwS2dYTjVnVFJPdHNxSTJVTFN2QUNkVkMtdDAzdVpfUjZ4V0tpYXI1QUpmZldTUzFWSmllQTQ9
first of all you need to learn the difference between how longterm and shortterm gains are factored in to us taxes when you swap a liquid staking token even being an iou for actual dot that is then considered taxable event and it resets the clock for capital gains taxes i work with many accounts on this exact topic so now youll be on the hook for <number> in capital gains versus <number> in capital gains depending on the amount of profit unless you then hold that dot for a year also you clearly have not read what the rfc proposes there is absolutely no risk to security whatsoever what happens is there is a queue of people that want to unbond if the queue is small then you can withdraw within <number> days in the event that the queue is filling up with a lot of people that want to unbond the time to unbond then increases all the way up to <number> days as we have now i can tell youre not very privy to how taxes work in the us so i highly suggest you partner up with some accountants because i can already tell with what you posted above you could have some serious tax liability issues,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERDROMkVHMnBNZkMwVkVYczRITEdkeFN3WXo2SGdRRS1keWtiUWFqWWtVSWZuVHZQbUFuWTZucnVfdFc2VUhxRjN5Z25OcGwtZkt6bmFHdV9qdW9rMnc9PQ==

this has to be some of the dumbest tax advice ive ever heard in a long time you obviously have a comprehension issue once you transfer from an lst to dot you reset the capital gains clock and have to wait a year to sell it in order for it to be considered longterm gains what part do you not understand about that so going by what you said youre never going to sell any assets that you ever i cant believe the amount of stupid on this platform sometimes you cant understand why somebody would ever want to unstake their assets and sell them at the peak of a market top or would want to sell rewards you also dont understand what the rfc is proposing clearly if the network is slow to unbond then you can withdraw within <number> days is the network is busy to withdraw then it will take longer all the way up until <number> days right now for example theres a lot more dot being state daily then there is trying to be withdrawn hence why were back at almost the <number> ideal staking rate ive been in crypto a lot longer than you kid this isnt my first rodeo sounds like you just dont actually understand anything youre talking about,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZUlzbkxucWxWTUNMOGdxT2V1dTk2VVFKQk02LVRZOXQ0Q2gtWjBXOW9zZk5DaExOUFJEdnZpR0NqcmFlTWgzWjhkWTItRUhtdUdScGdxWjJjYzhFWUE9PQ==

tbh ive always thought cardano manages staking quite well in a general sense from a user perspective the unbonding period is frontloaded so it takes a month before rewards begin to be received but unstaking is then effectively immediate once you decide to sharing in case of interest anyway,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEcHFTd3NfSE1vZ3B2NElEbzZaN3lGWWI5TFc1TkRDb2lySHVRWXVCRm9lMHFFaUh1UFFreHlieHV2WGpiQmRxcDZUTHlzbnVxOWdNRy1iZUxyNXNYdHc9PQ==
i dont think bifrost support ledger yet but i might be wrong on that the only risk is if bifrost were to fail but that is highly unlikely as it is one of the best platforms on polkadot there is usually a small fee for pulling out liquidity in any liquid stake pool it is usually a small amount but if a bunch of people left at the same time that could lead to a large fee ive never had an issue with it separate wallets with limited to no use is the perfect way to keep it safe without a ledger my recommendation take a few dot send it over to bifrost and play with the platform my current favorites places on polkadot are moonbeam stellaswap bifrost and hydra is growing on me,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQlByd25jdmtKMGtUeG5ONkc2enIySVBwaHFVUWNIWXpQSUpFcGFHVjdhcnVHOHYzWFN0UU1TX2g3NlQ5bXZpanFFMnVNM21KVUozTmhyS2d0dlFZS3c9PQ==

the reason youre not finding much information on these is that theres not much need for them as polkadot has better alternatives from an end user perspective both of these are useful for swapping tokens and there are better alternatives available since all of the polkadot parachains operate within the same consensus mechanism ie the relay chain theres not really a need for atomic swaps from the perspective of consensus sending dot from the asset hub parachain to the hydration parachain for instance is similar to sending dot from one account to another on the same chain there are technical differences of course but i mean in the ways that would matter to having an atomic swap you dont need the extra overhead of an as that comes with interacting between consensus mechanisms since you only need to trust one consensus mechanism htlcs in general are generally used in utxobased systems not accountbased systems like polkadot and most if not all parachains also use accountbased systems although have been some attempts at utxobased parachains such as tuxedo<url> if you really want to use a htlc you could write one in solidity example<url> and deploy to moonbeam or another parachain which supports evm interlay a parachain which interacts with the bitcoin network allowing you to trustlessly lock up bitcoin and use it on polkadot as interlaybitcoin or ibtc for instance uses xclaim paper describing xclaim<url> in this paper they note we compare performance and costs to htlc atomic swaps and show xclaim is <number> faster and <number> cheaper for <number> swaps,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEOHViUlBxeGJZMlA5NllaOXRtWGIzcDE0a2Z1YldWSWM5OC1NWmpHRXNxZ0tLMnR5Rl9HSDBzRUFaM0Y0bWlud244VWVBNEkxSlZ0WXV5ekZWMThFMGc9PQ==

currently polkadot and parachain use substrate which is a very flexible and extensible blockchain sdk it should be quite easy to disable cryptographic primitives vulnerable to quantum attacks and introduce those which are resistant afaik quantum resistant crypto is expensive to execute which is why it is not the default choice today there are many ways we could program ownership claims of old accounts this would be pretty dependent on the specific situation we have already done things like this before allowing eth accounts to claim their presale tokens directly to polkadot accounts i think overall the impact of quantum on polkadot is similar or the same as any blockchain today however polkadot stands out from the rest because it is designed to be upgradable and nimble with features like forkless upgrades so it is in my eyes a chain that would have a better chance of surviving post quantum,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGSnhTNGloZFZnNXgtZTY3NW1aSFJieXZBXzEwX0dCV3lJNUM5TVA1aVpXdU1iN3lJOFhPbXJiUE9BX0pCLVpWODR2cmlhdF8xckZzRFZPNFBVOGM4U1E9PQ==

because the app only supported the relay chain and then kusama had an app astar had an app etc everything was fragmented and some parachains werent supported at all so you would be forced to use a hot wallet now there is one single app ecosystem wide that works with polkadot kusama their parachains and chains built on substrate now no matter what chain you are using you can secure your tokens on the ledger hardware wallet this adds a huge amount of security and makes everything far easier to use you shouldnt need <number> applications on your ledger for polkadot and <number> other parachains most parachains dont even have a dedicated ledger app now there is no more switching between apps just one app to control them all the only thing you need the migration app for is to migrate your parachain balances to the new app if all you are using is polkadot the relay chain you can simply upgrade the application,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVmdEbXZZRWM1TGRRY3o1WHVtVnJxeUxVWjFBQXlGbExXc3FEX2FpdmN3YzRSaVhKWkRSZ3NDd0g3aVFWbWRoaWEyakI4SERDWTRSeXJtNHRCRkNpVGc9PQ==

i agree with this x is a shit hole of communication these days yes there is a large crypto community there but its a pretty vapid one most people are there to either professionally shill or scam and more importantly its advertising to an insular group of people youre not reaching new larger addressable markets by focusing comms and advertising there same reason they plaster taxis with print ads in berlin its for the crypto bros living in the city circle jerking your product isnt the way forward and heck i dont even think that polkadot should be focused on retail adoption if youre actually a layer <number> youre not the primary product youre the platform for products money should be spent getting quality projects to build rather than growing the direct userbase for dot building brand equity is fine but part of that is building trust with the ecosystem where are jewels in the ecosystem that build that i see none for dot as yet and thats disappointing when so much money went to projects like moonbeam,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHNDduV0JkcGNRWGFPQXd4WlA0NVBXTERKRWlLd2o4N0hDOGJWUGFvTDUtLThBNzBFbWRYbTZIODAxdjIyaFdCeHBEZm9ydDk5QzRSTVZDSm1LME5lb1E9PQ==
yeah im an active user but i hate opengov as a system of governance we need individual oracles that have future intent and guide the network forward ethereum works because vitalik and his dev team are exactly that there is trust and consensus around governance and decisions crypto is decentralised but that doesnt mean its disconnected from people people clearly see the dot treasury as something that they can take advantage of and they can and they will,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHZDROSHBHNTVZMEpSYWVZd1VCLUJYU01JVFp5NlVOM0k0bVRuVmt3aHpqR0tDMmthbERKUnVmSUhkOWJkSnN5bzZVSF9oUzJtRE05TnF0LXRab2xGX2c9PQ==

at first glance the size of the payments wasted on ineffective marketing and influencer payouts suggest incompetence however i think the true state of affairs is much worse this has all the hallmarks of a softrug meaning insiders are taking money out of the project via the treasury which they are either pocketing for themselves or yolo spending on personal itemspersonal expenses like cars watches holidays and the latest drip to flex on socials and are logging these payments as marketing expenses this slow financial attrition is how dot becomes the next eos furthermore the fact that dot paid <cur>k to put the logo on private jets in europe suggests that the project insiders are looking for exit liquidity from high net worth individuals some of these marketing expenses probably also included money gavin took for himself to cover the costs of his hair transplant lol ladies and gentlemen the dotbtc chart doesnt lie polkaflop is doing all the right things for an epic short in the bear market of <number><number> we just need it to pump with the rest of the market to come into a premium so that shorts can be built at higher prices this is how bag holders can get their money back and give the middle finger to the dot insiderslarge whales who in combination with poor tokenomic design have kept you all under water get out of this at break even if you can this isnt taking out its ath <url>,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHUjNrcmttRXdiUEdlMmVwNjd4Vzk0UkpJeFVzMndwY2RGZm5zcUNFZUE1WjlYRFQ5NU5rNVYxekVhNXFJN2pRZHlqcS1ydVdCU2puWER1Vk5xdDJTejlIVHpTVUlGUV9CXzdxVWhlbU5HSW89

i dont think that there is necessarily bad intent from most of the main dev team the issue is the amount of financial success too early relative to what is being built imo that inherently makes people lazy and takes away some of the hustle culture thats really important for early stage projects ego can also take hold and people lose sight of the bigger picture or get caught in it theres definitely too much spending on conference junkets etc although those are things that should still take priority over <number> of the consumer facing promotion which is redundant for dot in this stage of its lifecycle and if im ultra critical things like the jam release videography etc smell a little bit like vanity projects to me although id rather that than shitty youtube influencers where the bulk of things are seemingly going ultimately the hour on stage with vitalik the other week talking about jam to a larger dev audience was more meaningful than a year of promo and that pretty cinematic black and white video with a beer in hand anyway the rest of the wastage that you point out is inexcusable tons of bad actors amongst large token holders too it makes for an environment of extraction as opposed to building dot isnt dead but it needs to trim down and get development focused,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHVWtEMk12bkdGWmt4RE5RVmhXV29IRXBDa0liWjQ1bmNXWE9ZU0QwWWxGSFlhTHZ0eHJCc0g1eklueGNORWl3QlJFYi1VM292aGJNMS1LSzF2WHZjUEE9PQ==

it lets me choose from dot moon pacific atlantic etc and i choose to swap from dot to atlantic when i choose dot it shows my dot balance as long as i have it connected to my sub wallet instead of my manta wallet i bought the dot from coinbase through sub wallet even when i do this though however it doesnt give me a place to enter a destination wallet for the atlantic nor any way to complete the transaction i managed to swap some of my dot from sub wallet to manta pacific via change now and sent the pacific to my manta pacific wallet in manta wallet however when i connect to my manta wallet instead of sub wallet on the manta network bridgeswap page and then choose to swap pacific for atlantic it gives me a place to enter a destination atlantic wallet address but it says i have zero balance in my manta pacific which is obviously incorrect making me still unable to complete the transaction so as you see im at a loss here im so close yet so far i have both dot in sub wallet and manta pacific in manta wallet but i cant get either of them to successfully swap for manta atlantic im pulling my hair out lol anyways i greatly appreciate the help so far thanks again,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHMVFKaTduN0lVZndzTWNKYUtESmk0NEZ1U2wwUXR6WXFXaS1CYUlGTkhWTFNYUnNka2NsZ1pPYllTUF80cFFMZzAzeUtwLVNGSWJidmR6VUY2bXVzZFE9PQ==
tbh ive never really cared about short term charts i bought at ico c sold <number> at <number><number> peak when it was completely overvalued imo and the rest ill hold for another <number> years or so at this point its basically a binary bet and fwiw i hold magnitudes more btc and eth so dot is really just pure capital risk and in terms of this cycle i have a different opinion to most i dont believe that most altcoins will ever see aths again and i dont think that this cycle will see much more growth outside of btc and eth i think were at a different point in the lifecycle of crypto as a whole its completely saturated with too many large market caps and not enough liquidity and its very much prove it or lose it time but i also dont think its a sprint theres probably a <number> year window now where people either develop or die dot is one of the few with a large kitty to keep going so im not counting it out but if it doesnt succeed thats fine too whatever the case they need to completely overhaul their governance structure and expenditure imo,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHM2pGSEtkLVU3YlNORWJoMUdGWnBuellFb1d6YnJDQjA3QkpuM1hDTHNwdk4zNDd3YjM0NzhpVTZ0T1dqMmpCMEJVM3Z3djFocGpQU2NHNmdaZXlZbUE9PQ==

i think that i am tracking what you are saying you dont need to enter an atlantic wallet because your dot wallet and manta wallet share the same generic polkadot address this may be a shocker but this is the beauty of polkadot and its interoperability i would test out sending a small amount of dot i dont use sub wallet but talisman will show you all of your holdings on all of the chains like if i click on my polkadot holdings it breaks out my dot on astr manta hdx etc edit as for the pacific to atlantic portion where you are not seeing a balance im not sure about that portion ive swapped manta pacific to atlantic with no issues i dont think you can swap dot using that ui i would transfer it back to your normal dot wallet then transfer it via the crosschain polkadot>atlantic method,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHOW1mTHJJTFRWX2hDNTZaSU1VZ0FyWkFUODYzVDMyVnM4dzRrZlFCZkxJR2hIc3hDOGxTVUw5U3p3cWFoTU9uOVRmNmMtUU9JWldNTHplWWVqNFIySUE9PQ==

that is good to know thanks one part thats still a problem though is when i try to swap dot for atlantic it shows my dot balance and it allows me to manually enter an amount of dot that i want to swap but it doesnt do anything when i type in the amount like it doesnt load up and tell me how much manta ill get for the swap or anything like that and the button at the bottom that you would click to submitfinalize the transaction is not lit up and not clickable like ive done something invalid im sorry for all messages lol i cant believe how difficult this has become if you dont mind ill take a few photos of my computer screen tomorrow with my phone to show what im experiencing if thats cool either way i appreciate your time thus far,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHZk1UNGdIXzR1Ty1KX3dxc2ZXV2x5OTdtNGRJbXIwVzNWbGRNb19BVDJfYmtGekRrRWt5S0w3dmxBUE1kbnh4dTdTV3lhd0VLTmZsLUFURlNpRk82ZEE9PQ==

so in your argument it worked without the substance ignas couldnt generate that content gud job by him these are growing pains of polkadots governance and managing decentralized marketing as it has never tried before but at least it is transparent why do you think these influencers are asking for such high costs and why projects are feeling dependent on them i hope you werent naive to think that any other chain does nothing no you just dont see and know about it we learn through vianegativa unfortunately for progress projects like polkadot have to pay the high cost today until competition and better options arrive and that part has just begun but without the worst parts today wouldnt come as for the fud ride with it being talked about is still better than being irrelevant and with its fud there is a silver lining that shows the power of opengov and its uniqueness now expect some better marketers and business development approaches to polkadot good input by the cofounder of polkadot <url>,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNNDRyczhsWXJlbVBZZF9mbV93VGNWb2YxV05ITEV3WGVrN290ZEt4emtBRkQ4dUNiMzRxb0UtX0tPLUNfUlZyV1lxZ1NMczRiNnlSeEhxS3c4WEtsY1E9PQ==

think of polkadot as a solar system with a bunch of different planets chains each planet can utilize most of the other planets assets in order to send them to another planet you need to use crosschain messaging <number> the manta on stellaswap is moonbeam manta on the moonbeam chain after swapping for manta there you can use the bridge function to transfer from moonbeam to manta chain atlantic <url><url> <number> you can use the xcm function on stellaswap as well but i just tried it and for some reason it was being buggy the manta dapp bridge is working great <number> i would use the manta dapp bridge to send pacific to atlantic as well i use talisman wallet for this and havent branched out to any others but subwallet should be fine just know that moonbeam and pacific use the evm side of the wallet ethereum based address while atlantic uses the polkadot side also i was having issues getting my dot onto stellaswap using the bridge native xcm function it may be because talisman wallet just had a large upgrade just wanted to give you a heads up so you didnt get frustrated trying to get dot onto there,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNQ0VtMWRNeHhWU04xVDN5T2lhYkFDME5QUFREenpRc0RuRlgwTXczR0RZQ1dBSXdHSnc4UG5BNVZza24xaTdkLWl4N3d5SE5kRkJxT1pPeUxIbTVBR0E9PQ==

not gonna lie this whole migration update for dot app is confusing as hell and looks to be counterproductive simply using ledger in polkadotjs was fine for ksm and dot all this new migration is bringing a new complexity and not giving me the vibes things are getting more straightforward i would of simply preferred ksm to have a ledger live app and for the devs at ledger to actually keep ontop of the polkadot app which they never did it was always falling out of date and so on,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOdHY3WWx6YWNnOWE3UXJqN3pHNms4NGxNdGZRRjBVWmVqdUduUzFpZVl3eV9ibW43SkZPOUI4cm9fTlIxeHk4dE5Jdl9NSHo5cWo0aXVCTk5acFBPYmc9PQ==

it was discussed as nauseam in the other thread a couple of days ago the argument would be as echoed by at least one of the main devs and something that i agree wholeheartedly with is because dot is a layer <number> and its primarily purpose at this early stage of development isnt as a consumer facing product spending money on sports teamsinfluencerstaxis is just poor use of advertising money relative to the addressable market that youre trying to reach real value is investment in the development of the protocols that are being built on top of dot and actually bringing to fruition the kinds of interoperable killer products as dot so loudly promised that are actually going to bring consumers on board furthermore you have large token holders like giotto who are bad actors in the ecosystem and whom are using their power via opengov to extract more and more money from the foundation under the guise of such advertising ie memecoins,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOWmZHcUhaeUwtTG1icHk2bHpUY05STll2MnRBZU1rTmluVUF0Q3RleVd0WXY3ZkU1V1VFYmwxejZwWWZmLXRsUEVEbFJwbGxaM1N6VUdaQlZSMHJaN0E9PQ==

from what i understand though dot has a lot of developers working on stuff already no its like top <number> or <number> in number of developers im sure theyre not starved for funding to the point they cant do their jobs so whats wrong with a little marketing to generate retail interest into buying some dot potentially if they were dropping <cur>mil every couple months id be very worried but <cur>mil to me isnt all that lavish of spending in any case well have to see how they continue spending over the next few months,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOU05BTzNxekFWdXpoMW5NUjNVWVp0YjBLb0JXSV9LYUFjcHM0UkhQZXJ0elNEY0JCMWR1U2VuS1dhRFh2aGlsZmN6Ui1LTDludmpBLUxIWlB1eUlmN0E9PQ==

thanks a ton ok so im on stellaswap now i went to the regular swap page and put in swap from dot native dotdotxc and swap to the only manta they had mantaxc is this correct and also a bigger issue im having is that i have connected my sub wallet to stella swap and my sub wallet has several dot in it but when i type in the swap on the swap page it says i have zero balance of dot and tells me i have insufficient funds when i try to submit the swap i clicked on the wallet address in the upper right hand corner and it doesnt match my sub wallet dot address is that a receiving wallet address instead in the upper right corner do i need to send dot from sub wallet to stella swap first before i can do the swap on change now i always send the coin im swapping after i submit the swap also if thats the case then whats the point of connecting my sub wallet beforehand if i have to manually send the dot anyway plus the wallet address in the upper right corner on stella swap starts with ox and my dot wallet address in sub wallet starts with x so is the wallet address on stella swap even a dot wallet at all it starts differently i dont want to send my funds to an invalid wallet also where do i sent the mantaxc when i do get it does it automatically go to my connected wallet in this case sub wallet does sub wallet support the mantaxc moonbeam manta version of manta im sorry for all these questions i think were almost there and can this done today finally lol its just these things i like to triple check because they kinda confuse me and ive heard the horror stories of peoples money disappearing because of one wrong step it actually happened to me personally once already trying to get this mantra atlantic coin as always much appreciated thanks again,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNORGR2dDVFVTI5c2RyRUtuNzF0UTFkTnZqcmZHMFRxSU9faHJ3cW1zcEhzRnJIQXluQ2N4cDdNeG8yamNoN1lFQ0NRZ19iQ1lmcWNlUU9BcGFnZUxza2c9PQ==

the wallet that connects to stellaswap is an evm ethereum based wallet but is automatically tied to your polkadot address as well to get your dot in there you need to use the bridge function to xcm the dot onto moonbeam yeah all assets on moonbeam start with xc so youll end up swapping xcdot for xcmanta once you swap for xcmanta you can then go to the manta dapp bridge i posted above select moonbeam to atlantic,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOX2ZuQUgwekY2ZWpfMU0zMktCbXZfSVRfd24yZ1RoYkdBRFNEeG5WdXhfTDdVWFNXZHpIVE9JNWd0dFNDMFV6al9HaXBUMW80RTVpZHIzemowOTVMM3c9PQ==
thanks im gonna go try right now i used the bridge function on the manta network to swap dot for manta atlantic using my sub wallet i swapped a few dot and it worked but instead of taking dot and giving me manta atlantic it added the amount of dot i swapped to my dot balance and when i click on it it shows my original dot balance in full and then below that it shows the amount of dot i swapped in something called dotmanta atlantic not the regular manta atlantic any idea what happened and how i can get it to regular atlantic so i can send it to my nova wallet anyways thanks and im gonna try right now on stella,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOZlVmeGNZT0UwSi1CZEcydC1iUVVDTVJiYlpIYVN2b1M5MmFPY2tuQTA1bFJFRFRUYktwU1lOS3BDd1o2NXRSVVIzeDNrZ0dEWVVOU2NQcV9NWkxMcnc9PQ==

awesome thanks ok so ive got two issues going on now i know it never ends but i have gotten further than ive gotten before though so thats something first i swapped some dot for manta pacific through change now and sent it to my evm sub wallet and i also used the link you sent me to swap some more dot for dotxc and sent that to my evm sub wallet as well so now ive got a balance of both of those manta pacific and dotxc in my evm sub wallet so i should be able to swap them both for manta atlantic manta pacific through manta bridge and dotxc by swapping for mantaxc on stellaswap and then swapping that as moonbeam for atlantic through the manta bridge correct now heres my problems first when i try to swap the manta pacific in my evm sub wallet for manta atlantic in the manta bridge i click get address and my polkadot sub wallets manta atlantic address comes up and it shows my manta pacific balance so i enter an amount and the button on the bottom approve manta lights up so i click it and it gives that loading wheel for a second and then just stops everything looks right and it even lets me click the submit button but it doesnt go through it just loads for a second and then stops second issue when i try to swap dotxc for mantaxc on stellaswap again i connect my subwallet evm and my dotxc balance shows up but no matter how much or how little dotxc i enter for the amount when i click the submit button at the bottom it always tells me insufficient funds even though i have plenty of dotxc and its showing up in my available balance as well any idea whats going on with these <number> issues i think once i get past these i might be home free because i think both of those swapped for atlantic on the manta bridge will put all of the manta atlantic in my manta atlantic section of the polkadot side of my sub wallet and then i can send it from there to my manta atlantic section of my nova wallet where i want to stake it i appreciate you sticking with me this long thanks again,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOaTRuakJfT2g5aTJoNC00bXRSX1ZXdUF2aXQteEhvUzlEU1RueGxYRzItXzgzODJNN0l5Q09OZjNLV2RaTzQ2bWlDcFB4ZmNKM0NUc3JDaXJEVlNEdUE9PQ==

thanks ok so i swapped some for glmr and got the swap completed from dotxc to mantaxc so now i got a balance of both manta pacific and mantaxc in my evm sub wallet finally lol the only issues now are the other issue i was having before its now happening for both coins manta pacific as well as mantaxc as moonbeam when i attempt to swap manta pacific from my evm subwallet to manta atlantic going to my polkadot side of subwallet it allows me to enter everything properly and it allows me to click the submit button at the bottom but then all that happens is the cursor does this like loading image for a few seconds actually it turns into a spinning circle with a red line through it like a no smoking sign and then just stops and nothing more happens the transaction never happens even though everything looks correct second when i attempt to swap moonbeam it allows me to choose glmr or manta under moonbeam so i choose manta for my mantaxc something similar happens it allows me to enter everything properly and everything looks correct and legit but this time the submit button at the bottom is dimnot lit up and its not clickable as if ive done something invalid even though everything looks perfect so those <number> issues are the only <number> blocking me right now from getting this done and i think once i get past these issues ill finally have the atlantic in my subwallet and will be able to send it where i need it as always i appreciate your sticking this out with me i think youve almost got me there this has been a good learning opportunity for me too as far as crypto goes so thank you for that as well,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOc0dzWGM4dV9CSVFLX1BiUThfVnNoZ0U1SEgyNmJOV0VPbk5EeHVyVzY4VS1ZLUpsVnRuVTF1bF9XTjNOd1RVWmxDUEVjR3Z5MENabzAyaGZNV2RYdXc9PQ==

if youre going to go mobile i would highly recommend going with nova wallet as im sure almost everyone else here would obviously a hardware wallet is safer than a hot wallet but mobile wallets tend to be pretty safe you could even use a ledger nano x with nova but obviously youd have to carry around your ledger to make transactions on the go which i dont recommend <url>,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPaEZ1NlpLSG16b0w5RnJobU1oVFdZMDJMY2hxYjBBR3BvWnh6UFZfMUM3VWdnQk1FbURxV282VDlHbXNGWlhmUnhwV2JLNzVDUzBaQjcwODdDbFdLM0E9PQ==

nothing changes with staking on polkadot <number> staking only will change through governance if any referendums come up that will change the nature of staking i will certainly post here about it at some point we will probably offload staking to a parachain like asset hub plaza,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPS2JSWnRSUjY1dWJZVWRZUkhfT1hYQUdhdzd1VXhMZ1NCQ3laZ3dOdERsWWh6cHE1VGM0aENEMjBkTUl2RHFWNjJ1emRrdjhMa190bllQdmItVUYxYUE9PQ==
the problem isnt polkadot itself dot <number> is actually really good tech the problem is that there isnt a single parachain in the top <number> by tvl volume or dau moonbeam is the most used polkadot chain and it ranks ~th by most metrics for dot to succeed there need to be parachains that people actually use and it just hasnt happened <number> of the networks on polkadot are ghost chains,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPekYtWC1tWUlaLURsbGpKQjNLMDZLMHAtUGpiMGhGR1VzTEQ4VW5SVHZ4dEt2X28wWVMwdmFNWkxKQTBnN1VZd3VrNlV2MHRQSnNfT3d2dXFYVUdNZUE9PQ==
polkadot is a decentralized system influencers are putting up proposals in opengov and if the voters holders of dot vote aye to fund them then they get funded sentiment is changing with all of these marketing bounties however and people are starting to wake up i highly suggest listening to this x space on the matter <url> you can read some notes from the space for a general overview here <url> ded doesnt represent polkadot its just a single project built on an open system it would be like calling a gaming pc terrible because somebody created a game for the pc that you didnt like how many scams or rugs have gone on on ethereum or solana every open project is going to have these problems the sentiment ive been seeing in the community is mostly positive we have a lot rolling out with polkadot <number> the community is looking forward to plaza <url> and we have a massive upgraded system coming with jam,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZTZHSkF2Z3NYVHRjUDJNaE91c3FQMEMwcW9jNk9UWUlEMkZ2Ujc4UW85cXlMbGNkcGEzMjRyaWRzZElWUERhYVQzaFU4bGNua0dqRUlkbVZVSXhKR1E9PQ==

bots and hype have crowded the space is my opinion ai and memes dominated mostly and youtubers like ellio trades alex becker alt coin daily distorted markets by shilling memes shitty gaming narratives based on jpgs and or ada i think whats important is that polkadots gaming narrative is making headway quietly in the background i think these businesses are actually interested in generating revenues not hype,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPa3dXUlFJSGJkQ29zOTRNMlNhM3Blb0dURHdvNWxvZm40clRSZDZXWUpRMDJDRnRyNXE2YXlZeWxodjdEbXlZZ2Q1akZBUlMyZjZaTnlOT1V1cnFTcUE9PQ==
i cant disagree that whales can cause issues i also see this as the absolute infancy of onchain decentralized governance however you have to start somewhere and there are guaranteed to be problems mistakes and growing pains along the way but i have faith that we will get there even if it takes a long time a lot of bright people are discussing this it really is a tough cookie to crack though should people with more skin in the game and therefore more to lose and more incentive to drive the ship in the right direction have more say should one walletone vote be the way but what stops a whale from spreading their bags around should kyc be mandatory for all voting there is certainly a lot that goes into this issue i think delegations are a great step forward almost like a representative democracy decentralized voices is also a good step forward but there is most certainly a lot more that needs to happen and will happen,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPRUZ2TklKTzhwZllfa1NHVUdVRElLSzhoVndDTmhZSEVLVTlLRzYtc2dYNUhNbjVrQ3duZnc3RjFfTi1ReExqdmxzclAwUmYxN3ZmbkdlUXpVQlRrYnc9PQ==

you cant just import your ledger mnemonic seed phrase into polkadotjs you would need to find the correct derivation path it would be pretty complicated plus you should never ever import your hardware wallet seed into a hot wallet unless you are ready to lose the security of that account polkadotjs uses a <number> words seed phrase as well,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPQzVzcENxS2FNM1pwUnh3SnVQSF9rMnNDbDdkVmtJX1hEbmpjM09SdFR2Q2RXVm9sZ0c2LTB3SkJPQWtWMXBUWmc2RlY1elZVSHdJNGRoZmxkQVpVYmc9PQ==

you can try it out if you want ive never done it personally but i dont think you can just import your ledger seed and your balance will be visible the derivation paths are almost certainly different youd have to find which derivation path ledger is using for polkadot definitely ask in the requesthelp channel on discord because this gets way out of my league on a technical level you are certainly welcome to try it out first and see if it works however,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPMkZJMi1sVmNXaXk0akxXZTJaZnQ0SGdJbWhiY1F2ejlOX3NFTGRhUUVoUzhnOXN6RzdRZlp0R0Q1bW1vWkdyOVVqVEwtTGVUZU1sRUoyQ19ORkM5c1E9PQ==

it might sound trite but you can pick and choose what you listen to its actually worth the effort to tune out some of the dross because polkadot is a relatively self contained and slightly inwards facing ecosystem there tends to be overamplication of noisier voices and personality drama people get stuck in that bubble but when you dig into the related specific detail nine times out of <number> it turns out that the drama is mostly manufactured posturing and the evidence is edge case type stuff puffed up and presented as ubiquitous ie a lot of bollocks being talked and of course the usual social media bad faith ad hominem attacks and so forth happens around the edges too tldr find a couple of info sources you can trust and glean factual updates from kusamarian fits the bull on that front and ignore the social posturing when truism type accusations are made its usually worth finding out the detail for yourself start by presuming that the majority of opinions being expressed are rooted in repetition without much substance ive found that a useful approach anyway off to one side heres a social sentiment tool <url> seems like sentiment is actually relatively positive,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPTHNTOVl0VTRTNjk4UFJmd2tTcFljZy1JR0Q4UG1MSVliaktleUh3bjdxS1ljcFVudHJjR0VDYUc3Z1g1TjQzcUtoaldpbGMzWm1vTkVTVzRyVllTZnc9PQ==

the reason why polkadot treasury proposal submitters hold minimal dot amounts in their linked accounts may be related to the concept of the existential deposit ed the ed is the minimum amount of dot that an account must hold to be active on the blockchain the current ed is set at <number> dot when a user submits a proposal they are required to make a deposit the deposit is returned if the proposal is approved if the proposal is rejected the deposit is burned therefore to minimize potential losses users might choose to hold only the minimal required amount in their accounts when submitting proposals,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQaW5pdldvUzRURS01bVJHaUc3MWNtdEJsQmRxX0QzQTJENm9VelhjNm5KMzNDRkxGX09zQUdQakZXNkJZNnB2YjdqdzNmTzMxRHBueFdQRjktWDRHNmc9PQ==

there a few reasons why someone might choose to use a new or empty wallet when submitting a treasury proposal <number> security using a new or separate wallet can help to isolate the funds at risk if the proposal is rejected and the deposit is burned only the funds in the new wallet are affected <number> privacy some users might prefer to keep their main wallet private and use a separate wallet for public activities like submitting proposals,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQdDNkVnVITExhTnN3NGhKWURPTS03dkZtWjBnY1U5VGg5OTIzb2lWUGJsYWlNQnhiemRtcHFEVE1OYVkyZ29IamppVm5ZMHIxSFdjMmprbXpvd3pJc1E9PQ==

the real polkadot origin story is probably only truly known by the people that were in the room at the time but the story goes like this in late <number> ethereum foundation was thinking of multiple ways in which to become more efficient including its switch to pos and gavin was proposing a sharded model approach in order to scale horizontally something that the ethereum dev community at the time was not for seeing that he was the one that implemented the first version of ethereum and created the first version of evm and solidity language gavin said to himself if i implemented someones else idea aka vitaliks why not try to do that with my own idea via parity note parity was an already existing company that created one of the og ethereum alternative clients in rust before moving to create substrate also known as polkadot sdk and then polkadot and kusama in that order anyway thats how the story goes or some shit like that again nobody really knows except the people behind it but youre asking this question on reddit and thats all i got for u later edit as far as i know the dao hack has nothing to do with it,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRWURrWml5MUVIdnI4MEl4ZGhWZ1dnbHA2TFFYaTRnZGpNU2RfYmVpNFh2Q2VlejdSMXBEaGZjTU5vVDYyTk0yb2dMN2pzNnlHWTVNV1hUbnB0NTY0ZkJjWlZ0YXpqZzBmSEkyX1VzWFZwRkE9

the biggest scam so far is equilibrium finance in january i transferred a significant amount of dot to the equilibrium finance chain during that time i had read quite a bit about the project and wanted to give it a try unfortunately i made the mistake of not checking the leasing period so i send my dot to the chain and a popup appears stating that their inhouse eq token can be exchanged for the new q token i browse the site a bit more and get myself some eq and q tokens then i go to bed the next day i want to continue and try some transactions nothing goes onto the chain or off of it i go to the eq finance discord channel and ask around there i find out that the lease period ended today this means the chain has been halted i ask why it is possible to implement a popup on the site informing about a token swap but a popup with a warning about an impending chain halt is not placed no answer to this question i get the feeling they dont care about user funds here for the first time the responses ive been getting for months are always the same please be patient all funds are safu dont worry we are still working on the project how am i supposed to stay calm it has now been half a year and in the past few months eq finance hasnt even applied for a slot as a parachain other chains have swapped slots with other parachains to remain functional during this time eq finance doesnt even consider it necessary to provide any updates please help us many are desperate and just want to get their dot back to the scammers out there feel free to dm me and you will receive an appropriate response,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYjNuN3E3QmI0RHZNRjhjR2ZKSmJCT2h5c184S1pFSk40UXNQTktubWJtVXh0STJuM0RfNEZORU9VVDl4MFo0SHRzanRYTmhHLUwwR1lkZHZFeEhqMmc9PQ==

i will test both but until they are actually released i will have to wait and see which one works out better polkadot pay seems a better option at first glance since it seems to be working through a gift card approach with a <number> cash back option and no kyc the nova debit card is harder to assess as it is unclear to me if this would mandate kyc to obtain i am hoping a did decentralized id would be an option to obtain a nova debit card which is tolerable for my use case instead of kyc which is always a deal breaker for me with any chain or appchain in any event these are great additions to the polkadot dao mothership and i cant wait to read the fine print,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSWIwc283aEE2OFVCYWFkYzNYNHh5MFdmSGpDWFkxNmJlMGlxMDEwLU9ibzJQdjk1UWxrY1FNb2l6a0h4MEpzeVJRNjFtM2JBczRIcGFPUW1sMlV0bHc9PQ==

granted the tech is great imagine how it will be in <number> years time and not even with that in mind what about now for me its electricity bills = pad monthly paid with dot gas bills = paid monthly paid with dot university degree paid with dot luxury fun stuff splashing out on nice clothes iphone apple watch = paid by dot and not a dent in my actually savings dot principal holdings salary or emergency funds it just keeps on replenishing consistently every single day even though i restake compound and reinvest i still manage to cream off a few dot here and there just for the luxury so the project is good as a living investment now as well as the future it always feels good to take a little profit and unlike eth when you do want to cash out <cur><number> or something its peanuts in fees try doing that in eth or bitcoin a fourth of that will come out in fees so if this projects like this now when market adoption is low wait until polkadot <number> arrives with mass adoption not to mention polkadot etf around the corner institutional money institutions invest because theres a tried and tested and profitable asset if youre thinking selling now do so dont bat an eyelid bit if youre serious try to look at polkadot from a longterm perspective invest steadily with the same longterm timeframe and effort as you do investing in your pension it will pay for itself when you retire and if you keep steadily investing a small amount in this asset class along with your normal fiat stocks and shares investments you could probably live off this alone in the future you wont even need to touch your pension k or savings,r/polkadot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMTRsdWI0ZE02TE9Gc29PYm9ZM1Z5eE5YbEktRFBaUmdIZWh3ZV9fT3hJWXNRRDRVSVlYVEtLTkUxcVRvd0RrY3kzTWY2QUYxc0I0UkxhX0oxckZ5TVE9PQ==
