depends on what you mean by collapse but in the us theres a combination of factors that means anything so widespread that it affects the whole us at once leads to horrific outcomes<url> but thats a worstcase scenario and i dont think it will happen if it did the essay points out why i think survival wont depend so much on long term storage of beans or even ammo people planning for that kind of thing need a more radical prep moving out of the country before it falls the irony is im one of the few preppers who did indeed move out of the us and i live somewhere that is very insulated from a western civ crash i didnt do it because i didnt trust or even didnt like the us but its an interesting benefit that if im wrong and the us does get empd back to the bronze age im going to be fine,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeU45RGx4Vk1qUXppR3dDaGVxdGlKT0pEcGpsa3R6cmkyYlZOMjhjSjc4RGxJd0NNbmYxR1JCYXlxdjVJQk1sOUdUdWNnaUVrVmwyQmxkVnU5ckdSd3EtWGJFYXM4MGE1WS1sNEhtSm1CdWs9

sewers for the most part depend on gravity and natural slope so they just keep working that said some parts of your town may require additional lift pumps due to unfavorable geography these pumps almost always have backup power but that power only lasts a couple of days if you spend some time on your municipalitys website you can probably find out my city has sewer systems plans posted somewhere anyway if youre behind a lift station then yeah if the pump fails your section might slowly fill up when that happens homes in the lower sections might see sewer backing up if youre the guy on top of the hill this is probably not a concern but if youre in a lower spot near the lift pump it might suck there are backflow prevention devices that can be installed on your sewer line and mitigate the risk some municipalities actually require them for new construction or you can have it installed its probably less than a grand or so mostly labor im not sure if the emp sewer concern is particularly interesting but there are other reasons why sewer systems can fail or be overwhelmed for example unusually heavy rains or partial flooding,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRUNnTTVfX19DbFdXVFo3TkRxcDd4MjktTTRwNThFY3RZZS1ZRE13NEZoTlJWOXhCWVNEenpocmRUZFREWkUwdUpqVEZSUmVUdDlCdkloU3RhMzhYbkxpcWxBbXZTMGtGT1pDdnpzT2huTjg9

just some context for some of these recommendations most regular water filters are only good for filtering bacteria and physical debris they wont help with chemical contamination eg heavy metals like lead or things like fuel or fertiliser or viruses whether this matters or not depends on your water source and one of these filters is still a worthwhile filtration step even if you have to follow it with a purification tablet boiling or a uv steriliser as it will enhance the effectiveness of those methods,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM0FtWUN3cEZhcDJIWGloU0dmNGpobXh6c01rLVVaNDF5Rm16MnVaMkhpNnp1TWRyVngtTUtxNG5sOEVRbzRqLThSS0dWMmstSWl0eEV2LXh2N2oyNmc9PQ==

obviously people make different decisions on how closely they follow indoor and outdoor stove recommendations having prepped in a small apartment for a long time i felt fire risk and carbon monoxide were significant threats especially in an emergency so i made pretty conservative ie safe decisions i bought a butane stove rated for indoor use and stored <number> butane canisters they let you use high and low heat somewhat like a regular stove the camping stoves are not generally rated for indoor use the primary fuel i stored were the sternotype jelled alcohol and a bottle of denatured alcohol these have a very long shelf life and are not under pressure so much safer to store inside i also had an alcohol burner for camping id experimented with the best set up for cooking and providing heat there is now a cookerheater called the vesta that is pretty clever and can be used as a stove or a heater that blows the hot air toward you without additional power ive never tried this personally since i now live in a house w a wood stove if i had stayed in my apartment i probably would have bought one many people recommend the big buddy which uses propane canisters or a larger tank some states rate it for indoor use some dont i was never comfortable storing propane inside my home whatever you decide its important to have airflow with any flame a fire extinguisher and carbon monoxide alarm get a battery operated digital one so you can see the level of co not just once it goes over the safe limit i also kept a fire blanket handy in my kitchen if you catch a fire quickly it can be smothered without spraying foam etc all over the place,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbUtQbnhGai1mRlBSRl9kblRSaVl6UURjM0FhR2Fhc0lwcjh0TkZBUHBaTDNpQUxnTGg1LUk5MG42YWx2QjdtSk4wM2pHcVFka180MElCOXVUdHZ2RHppTk1yZDhZYzRNWlM3RWprR2RwNDQ9

if they are talking about a hilift im sure there are a billion videos theyre also really damn dangerous even if youre careful anyway the main things are jacking up the vehicle and they can lift a lot higher than any other jack which is why off road guys use em they can also be used as a mechanical winch if you jack up the front or back and you push your vehicle sideways while it is up the jack will tip over and move the lifted end of the vehicle over slightly which is dangerous as hell but useful if you plan and are lucky theyre super unstable so it is easy to push the vehicle in any direction causing the jack to tip if youre not careful it can tip into the body causing damage i have had too many accidents happen fortunately no serious injury death or destruction so i hope i never have to use one again,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaGRmMWRTUmxrVDhmanNjSWpiU2ViTVp4eV95QVhDcWVUVWxWalFrTGsyeWdBZVQyQUxvSUhsT2VTSXJoWVFlRXgxaV9VTUpPcFdCQXFMMDAxWE1YWkE9PQ==

i found out something else too since i wrote this morning happy goose bay area is also on fire so one of the solutions to this is to get away by boat nl has thousands of lakes and a maze of water ways most people have boats there and skidoos for winter cycling would not be realistic in that situation and you would be better off if you were trapped to move out of the way in a boat the smoke would still be a problem but you would have a better chance of surviving on water than on shore if you had only one road in and out and fire coming at you from both directions its not a fun situation and our prayers are with those people that are dealing with this the other thing to consider is the distance and the amount of fuel it takes i think there are one or two service stations open during the summer they use the skidoos and i would assume cats in winter to travel so they would have to have fuel for those vehicles but can those stations supply all of labrador city i dont know how that situation would be it was a problem with the ft mac evacuation a couple years ago the other way is by air which would probably go to st john nl evac by air would mean taking very few things with you and would be extremely expensive since you would have to rely on store bought food instead of locally foraged or fished i think a gallon of milk is something like <cur><number> there not sure since the prices went up over <number> this year we are watching this very carefully this is the third time in the past few years that people fairly near to us have had to evacuate without warning,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcXpicERZenFhY1ZHWF94aGd2TWtvc1FrM1phTU9WamxiVDRaeDZMSnFQWWNXbkNxWFJ5bnRrdWMxOWNWR0lieUVEZ2M5MjZCWU9EYU9HNjl0NnYtb0hVaVkxQmlwRm1aMlJ5WHF0aUJMSm89

yeah i second this i really dont understand what you are trying to accomplish here i mean it kind of looks like you were trying to make a bug out kit but it doesnt make sense i mean as nice as they are who want to walk around carrying a mm ammo box vs a backpack also its missing most of the basics like clothing youve got a half dozen means to make fire but what would to do with a fire your not cooking you have no cookware your not boiling water you have no cup i hope its not for heat because you have no cold weather gear shelter or means to process large amounts of wood needed for heating plus i mean if your worried about a radiological event hence the potassium iodide tablets you would never want to go outside those tablets dont make you radiation proof they just protect your thyroid which is maybe more at risk from radiation but its not your only vulnerability of course if it was a bug in kit then why would it be stocked with things you have in your house i honestly dont get it,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZajhSbFQzQzhZeTZzVS1LY04tc3BhOUhYNTM5RGhXb3NMUzQ5RThWaUp2YTJVTHA4dUtyQUE5TWY1UFlHeVlzbEJaNllTUFY4NXRRczB0RTgyaE9POFE9PQ==

i just look for things to make general comments on when i see my neighbors outside i spend a lot of time talking about the weather i guess the best way to foster shtf trust is starting with general trust such as offering to keep an eye out for your neighbor my neighbor had gutter issues so we gave them something we already had to help them they used their drone to check out the roof tiles we lost during a storm they asked us to keep an eye on their house when they went on vacation it just went back and forth like that we also became parents at the same time and had trouble with the same neighbors we have the same education level for a few hours a year of friendly chatting and some exchange of favors i feel like i could trust my neighbors in a shtf scenario i think we care about each other enough to look out for each other i do similar stuff with other neighbors but i feel like the neighbors i mentioned are the real mvps i also want to add to just be careful of what info you share with people about prepping obviously what we do could deter people from interacting with us because we are focused on something considered taboo to some also disclosing resources of any kind can be a liability in shtf scenarios,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb1hNUGFhcV9ocVdoSjVEUHMzMFlXQjJyZXgxVzN4c3YyQUNiaE4zdzBuQ2k3THFqZUYxNFY4US1fc3FrMVBYNFRjOE9SVlYwRGpnWUNRWXRYMGRqSEE9PQ==

i meant sanitation and hygiene more in the sense what if i cant flush and need to poop in a trash bag what if i cant take a shower for a week or two antiperspirant wet wipes etc you know everyday stuff in general the most useful way to bootstrap a preparedness plan is to think about these everyday scenarios what if i cant do the usual stuff in the usual way versus how do i fend off tigers in the wilderness anchoring to everyday scenarios also helps you avoid buying random stuff just for the sake of it another poster is talking about fire you have fire starting tools but what do you plan to do with this cooking heating do you have a pile of firewood in the backyard do you have a camping stove etc etc cash again depends on the scenario youre worried about probably good to have enough cash to get you through normal living expenses groceries etc for two weeks or so <cur><number> may be aiming low but then maybe you have it for some other reason,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcWJ5RG5lTEZsdE5GcDEwQ3VzUE4xbGJNbFRLMWhrcWVIQWxYRXZNOXZ3bTJ1eHBmQWJUd3dnWllFM1QxM3FuR1ZZRzl6V0cySUpESi01STJFTlYyTmNybDVjbnlWeF9IZFZYbDRYd1lra289
so i think this is more of a problem of how to be more sociable than it is about finding a mag if your sociable the rest is easyish i mean youre objective is not to make converts you want to find likeminded people you dont need to start a conversation about prepping with these people that is the lens they view the world through and it seeps into everyday conversations what do they talk about and how do they talk is their hobby raising chickens when they talk about politics do they express concerns about the future will impact them do they have a small armory at home one brush stroke at a time it starts to paint a picture of who your dealing with and youll know if they are they kind of person you might want to associate with in terms of prepping even beyond that just because someone is not a prepper does not mean they may not be a good resource i mean lots of people have skills they can share that you might need people disseminate news and information about things they might have an inside view of many people are connected with jobs via networking having a vast social network is a big plus to you,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZclRrSGFsQjIzSHZ1NkRVLW0yX0w4V0lwd3I1eVdaYTFxTjNhd3dnZ1oycDJJMTBoRXNoWEdCOWppMGRIdmN4TExJblFGVkIwVnBuQ0hOUlhtWjZlMmc9PQ==

have an emergency fund dreaming of going into the woods and living off the land can be fun but is entirely impractical the most common problems you are going to run into involve unexpected bills car breaks down medical expense etc losing your job unexpectedly or other issue where having a reserve fund makes a catastrophe into a mere inconvenience it also comes in handy in some of the realistic cases where you might have to bug out wildfire or simple house fire tornado hurricane flood etc in that case youd be bugging out to the nearest hotel and living off the buffet instead of the land a reserve fund comes in handy in so many case that actually are likely to occur in your life,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdHV2ZEdfNzlObmJlZldlMDk4dktfWnhDVEtFOGpteUFaX0RTWlhLV0lxZm5wRmVFUVE0ZU1KZzhQMnN3UXFuNFF1QU1XUEN0VW9DVVJLYU1VbEFJQ0pUNmNYbVJLNlNnaGxBNUVpZUwwekE9

thoughts if you can get an rv or a traitor out there you can often buy them used for a good price especially rvs or buses with blown engines that you just want to tow out there to stay in one place there are ways to seal the roof so they can provide shelter for a long time ive seen great some shed conversions but mostly from wooden sheds like tuff sheds and they can be quite expensive for the larger ones there are several youtube videos on shed conversions you can put up a shed to its specs and then make it more hardy but its harder to do with plastic or aluminum than a wood build instead of something like you describe you might want to look into a wooden shed kit it would be a little more stable and easier to add insulation and drywall you may want to look into something like a yurt or the type of heavyduty tent and stove that is made for winter camping cement is cheap id dig down <number><number> feet and do cement floor then build cement walls and a ceiling it has heating and cooling advantages and is bullet and fire resistant but it takes some specific skills to do cement wallsroofs not to mention labor and time its much easier to do if youve got a good water source although this would be my preferred building type id personally go with a used trailer or a yurt due to labor required to build a cement shelter in an area you have to haul in cement bags and didnt hs e a garden hose if youre willing to haul it out there cement blocks are easier to build with but youve still got the roof to construct finally you might want to look into earthbag homes they are pretty awesome and you can use the dirt and materials around you for these you can dig a foot or two or more down and use that dirt to fill your bags its one of the least expensive and most insulated ways to go if you do this know that they can last a really long time as long as you put the right coating on them sandbags break down in the sun pretty quickly if you dont coat them right but there are several options if youre really adventurous and motivated you can build a great lasting and insulated shelter out of brickstones or mud brickswaddle sounds like fun if you have the time and energy,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRmdIRF9JZmRfOG9mWHVGVnRxUHVJSDBpbVJlMmJicXJTVFhDTmtlWEg4ZElZWm1QZ1J3NEFkRDgtaUNNMzVWV3NWVzY1RTRCLVRVNUptRHc3dkE5Y3c9PQ==
extreme introvert <> autistic and lots more introverts than autistics not saying your not autistic just so far your description leans more towards introvert similar topic already posted today <url><url> and a few other posts recently around how to meet other preppers how to find like minded people how to form prepper groups are posted here frequently can go back and look at some of those its unlikely that the shared interest in prepping will help you meet people mostly because there arent really that many preppers and many arent open actively try to hide it i agree with others that prepper adjacent hobbies can help you meet people a local gun club near me has social events a few times a year so yes you can meet preppers but i wouldnt look to that as a way to be most of your social network if that makes sense like those are two separate issues a how to meet preppers and b how to meet people and form relationships in general,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTVlTZFlVTGJaQzF3WndJUXFmdE9yNmZRcmU0LThnMUl3R3pMVHNSWjVUZl9LUFk0Slk5b3dGOVRKTWNLTmVUZmFydHNuNDFUWTVsT1dWbGNBcWplOW1IeUttRnl6Rnh3LWJ3Y1ZCZUxaWW89

depends on your area flood tsnami power outages lack of imports and fresh water mudlsides half the part of prepping is knowing what your areas are vulnerable to and deciding a good bug in location not necessarily bug out preparations access to solar power and g drum of water can last you a long time in a disaster and having a stockpile of preserved food for at least a month and you will be fine most everyone i know on islands have a power generator but then access to fuel becomes an issue so that is another prep to think of a few jerry cans you rotate out you could live like a king with the right preps,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYlQ0NzlmQTFmdklHV0V1eTRQYVh1Y0RzU2JzajRWUXdQcWFMMU4td0dYU3cxM1RRekR6OUpoWF9GMnNHZEUxUVBydjdJSU1Zd0RaUEpGa0RZWjlzcFE9PQ==

to expand on my earlier comment in addition to macronutrients protein fats and carbohydrates you will need micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals the first part of the word vitamin vita means life dark leafy greens carrots radishes redyelloworange peppers tomatoes onions garlic etc are very nutritious and promote health over the long haul brightly colored veggies and to a lesser extent fruits are packed with vitamins try to get a mix of colors every day as an easy way of covering all the vitamins this is why seeds are an essential part of a long term plan if you have seeds youve got a shot at a future no seeds means that these foods carefully bred for literally thousands of years in many cases are lost to your family so buy seeds buy a lot of extra seed since you can expect garden failures and will need extra seed to try again in different locations seeds are living things so purchase new packets every year or two to ensure good germination rates it varies by plant for example onion seeds have a very short life but beans have a long life i buy fresh packets every year and save all the old packets to have extras even if they only have <number> germination thats still better than nothing you cant have too many seeds since any extra packets can be given to friendsneighbors or be used for trade while waiting for your garden to grow you can try gathering wild greens like dandelions for a while but these are often too high in bitter compounds and oxalates for longterm use domesticated garden veggies have been bred for nutrition with fewer troublesome compounds tldr buy seeds buy way more than you think youll need,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaW9OSllvMUpmRlNES296U1g4RU02aGpWUXNjUGU3dTZqdDNEOEVjYmNRQkpqM3lITElIMFh3ZFc0MnhXQk4xZ3o0VmdxWVIyTjdRM0d5U29meGpHcHc9PQ==

for fun doesnt sound right but factually and materially i guess i am not as serious about this as i could be i am poor disabled and currently unable to work because i am having so many surgeries and so much recovery time i have to keep living in a big city because i often times need emergency medical care or even emergency surgery so what i can prepare is very minimal most of it is gaining knowledge about skills tools and my surroundings due to living alone and often times being stuck here for a long time during recovery i have plenty of food here and could go at least two months with it currently but my most likely scenario wouldnt be to bug in i prep for a house fire power outages and most importantly financial hardship i know how to mend clothes i know a few things about repairing household things i know how to make a lot of food from very little etc i also try to be as physically fit as i can not necessarily for a big shtf scenario but mainly so i wont be knocked down by the first fall in my s or s women have a bigger risk to not recover from that because our muscle mass deteriorates after the menopause so building muscle is key in case of a big shtf scenario like a war id have to make my way to my family who live more rural i have a plan for that a bag and i know several ways by foot to get there but all that is pretty useless when i am just out of surgery id probably just die people say war is unrealistic but i live in germany the upcoming election in the us will determine a lot if there will be war here or not the us will deploy weapons here either way which makes our big cities a target of russia unrealistic maybe but not as unlikely as a war in the us itself i am this paranoid because the signs of the last war are still here the people in my life who lived through that war and still remember the one before that could still tell me about it first hand i dont want to panic and over react but i dont feel like having a plan in place is useless i cant really prep by buying things i have a list of what id need to buy to survive in a war scenario but thats all not affordable right now namely my ostomy supplies so why am i here for window shopping honestly prepping makes me feel secure i have a lot of shit going on in my life and not a lot of control over things so i might as well take control over whats possible my medical issues scare me being poor scares me i am scared of whats happening in the world and where we are heading even without a big shtf event i am not ashamed to say that i am just scared and i really love this life i dont want it to be threatened by something i could have been prepared for in an ideal world id get healthy and be able to work again id prepare by saving money for my future and that would be it but i dont see that ideal world,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY05FQzRpVk5fdUhiVUxtR013bjlyQ1dwWDNzZ3ZZUlk4U2NVMlM2QVNVLWh0bzZCbW1xSjBpNkxtQlR1REs4NnR1c0NRckpLQ0JzeXhYNk96cW1pNUE9PQ==

in high school i had a science of survival class they taught orienteering skills mostly map reading how to find edible plants fish and insects how to make a shelter in the woods and some first aid i started my senior year as i pointed out earlier there are many situations where your house or flat may be destroyed it takes less than an hour for a forest fire to start and get out of control if its spruce woods and dry a tornado can blow a house apart in seconds hurricanes drop trees and wash houses out to sea if you live on the coast an earthquake can make a house dangerous to enter or flatten it in a few seconds you cannot rely on storing food and water to get you through a disaster there is no guarantee you will have a place to store it or be able to access it during and after the disaster ive lived through several and ive seen economic collapse in mexico volunteer working as a student its not just theory ive been through it what you might want to learn right now are skills related to camping and backpacking if something happens shelters and refugee camps quickly deteriorate and become havens for disease hunger and crime it is best to avoid them can you set out on foot in a manually powered boat or bicycle and stay out for a couple weeks til things cool down probably not right now yet being able to bug out is the best option for most scenarios you will encounter could we have a war yes its possible but not super likely and even if we do its not going to affect all of north america its just too big and most of it is sparsely populated still compared to england and europe i would learn backpacking and bike packing first just doing overnights with a few friends learn what you need what works and what doesnt learn to forage and fish you have to develop a taste for wild vegetables theyre more bitter than the kind you get in the store but also better for you seeds are also important learn to garden guerrilla gardening how to process a rabbit or chicken to eat it learn to cook over an open fire or with a jet boiler how to can and dry food learning stealth camping is a good idea as well you cannot depend on a supply it will run out and you cannot depend on the place you are storing it to be available or intact plus that kind of meal ready to eat food is astronomically expensive for the benefit you have to be self sustaining developing the ability to live on your own without help keeping a low profile are very important to surviving in a bad situation,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSGJuWmhzUVc1d3ZsTm9IV2laREpiVUVNdk1pTlZoQVdaOVJDV3ZZbzh3aXp0M2RJcW5JaGMtekJFeU4wbUNvTmR4cGZyNXVxeHI0Sm83TnBsSWpiUXppMzU3ZFR6V3liNXlJY0tRN1Bla1E9

i am in a situation where we are experiencing frequent problems with fires storms and economic inflation im having to improve our ability to deal with unpredictability and possibility of losing power frequently and for longer periods of time its more of a matter of skill building for me this is going to be a long term problem that probably will not get better in my lifetime we might lose utility services at some point which will shut down the supply completely no power cant pump fuel trucks and boats cant run so i want to make sure we can get through it without government aid because you cannot depend on that resource to be there for you i live where i can grow raise and forage as needed but i think skills are more important yes i preserve food but its mostly to help with expenses rapid evacuation and stealth camping is what i work on,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZ3htY0tLOWlMWUEtOXVVNVdnZWtGRkdmYld0a0t0ZUhXT0JaandwT1BYMzFMRkhrZUt3bEZkNGRlN0VKeFhGcFlTYk0yTFpVQW1kWXhrd3dtWjMxeG56alpFalZvUnU0YTNnZW5xR21TN0E9

i like your mindset i too want to preserve society what is left and what did not cause what happens to need my expertise but the idea of durability in the tools used to continue a gun to me is an equalizer the use of which has negative repercussions but usually positive outcomes a smaller person with a gun can end a problem with a larger person who has only physical size but is trying to exert force basically rape defence positive defensive outcome using the gun will have repercussions if done wrongly someone is shot and now there is trouble negative repercussions but i would rather have it than not now i have this tool i need to use maybe best if i know how to those that dont know shooting a target can be difficult short barrels allow for errant shots due to short sight alignment bad for long range good for cqb long barrels are an issue of mobility great for hunting bad for cqb shotguns are a middle range solution all that prep talk has me tinglingbut what about the user the person using this tool are you planning for usage just for immediate defence pocket revolver or liberator are you planning for forage and hunting ol <number> are you looking for hold out defence shotguns in your hallway maze but the best option you have is figuring out what you want then the shtf happens and see where you are did you prep are you ready well that depends on if you prepped right do you know all the shit i just wrote am i wrong in what i wrote how do you know to know you need to train to train that takes time and effort that means using that gun at a range or while hunting to learn and that means rounds through the barrel so that dude saying he wants to fire <number> rounds before he has to find a new barrel and trust it for his prep is justified,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUDJYcTF5eGVuQXFPV0RfbWVEcEVSWmVDbEx3eHdaV2h5d0VUS3BEMEJLcDZxcXhzXzUxOVhNY0xUU1dndl9PUnBlaE5qZHBKTWhQclNrQTZlLWhqaUE9PQ==

the psychological importance of good food is nearly as important as nutrition most people could not eat pasta and beans for a week without psychological suffering being in a shitty hopeless sad mood for short or for long can be deadly in a high stakes scenario where youd need that much stored food years of eating pasta and beans would feel like unbearable torture and many would curse themselves for not preparing variety and flavor optimal way to do it is a deep pantry most of your favorite pantry foods last <number>+ years so when something you already normally buy is on sale buy a dozen eat what you buy for example last time i was at sams club <number> oz quick oats was on sale for <cur><number> i know <number> oz is ~<number> meals so at the rate we eat it will take <number>~<number> months i check the expiration date is in <number> months and i know it will still be good at least <number> months after then so i buy <number> containers thats <number> meals <number> calories for only <cur><number> and we will eat it,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMDZCV0FaSXBJS1FLWm5HNW9LTHhZdGFfWVZrSDg3RXpXMjlGcElTekFscUx3amRPUW9zWEtLMU5TdnhJMi0xaDJmUkk2TENhOERZYkRYQldxYmh6a3c9PQ==

your biggest issue for the long term is lack of vitamin c it is water soluble so your body doesnt store it b vitamins are water soluble too while vitamin a and d are fat soluble not enough vitamin c and scurvy sets in which can be typically very nasty in its later stages leading to death problem with vitamin c storage is it does lose its potency rather quickly,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbXMyMktnQ2FDbFFJQzRxTlczRWNPcnA3Z1hTaDl5ODctdE1NSUw1OXFuZXJQSUVHbGNnWWdFeU0ybUJ6N0JNR2ZjRUYwMzhJZ3BuZ3I5aGp1VzVRX1E9PQ==

realize scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin c sailors may have had plenty of calories but without vitamin c they fell ill regardless i also want to be clear nutritional deficiencies can be quite severe again scurvy for example was no laughing matter not only does it cause things like teeth falling out and fatigue which could be bad news if you are in an emergency situation and need to work hard but also much more serious symptoms like scar tissue breaking down and old wounds reopening and the inability to heal new injuries scurvy literally kills as result from complications like bleeding or from infections from open sores all from a prolonged lack of just <number> vitamin vitamin c it is important to make sure you are getting the right vitamins and nutrients and not just calories but calories from the right sources sugar has lots of calories but dont think you will make it far on mountain dew alone,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVEZLd19Sb1dVSTdrbWFsZUxNLVp0aHU1UlpUVGk0dVRaRUt0Z3pFSGkxY0E1YXU5RDVMMWdoQkhjb3VkQng0SnBqc0w0NmxPb0dzcm04WXlFTVViUFE9PQ==

nutrition and calories are both critical in the long term variety of foods can help emotionally and psychologically but since each food has a somewhat different nutritional profile it can also help you avoid vitaminmineral deficiencies for example black beans have more iron and potassium but chickpeas have more calcium that may be the reverse but you get the point i keep a deep pantry and separate long term food storage and try to think thru the balance of calories macronutrients proteins carbs fats and micronutrients vitamins minerals etc if you are planning on continually eating out of your food storage and replacing it you have a lot of flexibility for what you buy since you dont need the extra long shelf life the core of my long term storage is wheat berries rolled oats white rice and a variety of beans these all have <number>+ yr shelf life if properly packaged and stored and provide the calories protein and carbs that i need they provide a range of micronutrients but need to be supplemented with items from my pantry garden or foraging to avoid deficiencies vitamin a c b calcium are some of the nutrients they dont provide enough of in case my garden or foraging isnt possible i keep some specific supplements and foods i dont keep multivitamins because i dont take them regularly and they need to be rotated ascorbic acid powder has a very long shelf life since it doesnt have the fillers and binders etc of tablets dehydrated carrots <number>+ yr shelflife and canned pumpkin provide beta carotene for vitamin a i also keep sugar salt not iodized it has long shelf life vinegar dried sea vegetables ie seaweed for the iodine not added to my salt and instant coffee in my long term food storage fats are critical to health and not good candidates for long term storage you can stretch their shelf life but not like dry foods i make sure i have a year or two of fats oils nuts seeds canned fish etc in my pantry and chest freezer and rotate thru them,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaW1NYmFsRTM1eHl4NmZUNWhVTWtrT2duOWczbnd4VEVTYWUzSXZnSVhTOV9aVk1VdjNmWVVOc2R3OHZBRHI3dUZJeU1CTjdaVklQVGdMaVg0RmJlcTlpRHVSd3VQdFJXZ1hXVzBwRmxqZUE9

yeah all that talk about larp as a guy get a dog or have valuable skills make me chuckle only people which have never had any experiences with actual harsh reality can post shit like that a useless guy or a dog preventing you from something will just get shot straight away all your skills will be simply expected from you on top of that or else something worse than you piv will happen lets say op is a medical professional well she doesnt need her toes for that or good knees making her too mobile if she thinks she can talk back and not help her owners and if she puts up too much of an resistance or is not usefull enought to botter well you can imagine best a woman can do is pick her poison a strong male in a group of strong males able and willing to protect her but if anything happens like it happened uncountable times in human history everyone will quickly learn those things no amount of being able to cook or clean makes you worth to keep alive per se worse than rape would probably be giving birth without medical help so imho knowing your options to prevent them even something like family planning and herbs would be much more usefull,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadlNuNjBHMlp2T3FrbWhRbEpPTHR3dEl1Yzl5b3REUjYzeDBuOC1QYjYzSGFWWEgtdUZ6aHJnSTdGT19OeUJzWDVZcHpfRklRSVRHMWN2N084SGFjZXc9PQ==

look at ancient societies in history to see which cultures promoted women in power and for what reason eg the norse germanic tribes had volvas ie seeresses they were women who facilitated important business in the tribe eg herbal medicine legal disputes of inner village matters like divorces nursery and being responsible for birth deliveries education craftsmanship especially related to textiles farming etc in short volvas held such power of importance becos they were integral in the cohesion of their society and vital to the survival people always only think of warriors weapons but <number> of survival is about a working community economy volvas and the importance of women rights waned and disappeared only after christianity rolled over europe and cut down the rights of women so they had no way to be important anymore other than breeding so the lesson is learn useful skills that not many others have and that make you a vital valuable member of society avoid becoming reliant on others at every cost or men will trade you as cattle,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacVV4N3JSQkNETUlRSWdhTEhvTWdES0oxcl9QVmNoM19rbVd2WXdnZG5Hd3hPVUNDakF2LWxTVkw4RjRtX3FyR1prRzBKc1V5cGlRVHZhLUw3NXlxWnc9PQ==

>concerns are discussed at the rate they occur >less than <number> of rapes committed and thus only gets <number> of the conversation were getting rather sidetracked here but i felt it was important to note that the statistics are only going to include the instances that are talked about on at least some level as in reported and given that men appear to be less inclined to report rape and abuse in general its likely safe to assume that the actual rate is higher than reported and potentially much higher bringing it back around to the women collecting firewood because theyll only be raped whereas the men would be killed its safe to assume that at least some of the men would be raped before being killed how often that would be the case is something of an unknown but we can assume it wouldnt be <number> so the overall risk for men in that situation is in some ways higher and bringing that back around to the original topic of how women can prepare its good for us to have the awarenessreminder that a shtf scenario that reaches the level of yugoslavias situation could include the potential sacrifice of self for the sake of loved ones women who might otherwise be safe from rape or other unlovely things could find themselves choosing to accept greater risk if it means they can keep someone they love safer and that applies to men as well but the topic of this post is how women can prepare so ,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWE9SVW5CdnVRTXRRaUNEMmtyMXNEc2E2NjFwbzJpckRCelREZXA3cW1WWTV0NVp6WDI2cVh2VjhPZlpiSmYtVHFfRHh3T0tsWG95S0JzdXV0bEVRb3c9PQ==

you have raised a question that is not only very important but which i have been wanting to talk about for some time owing to changes i have made in my own diet and things i have learned lets start at the beginning america is perhaps the leading western nation in which a great many people are simultaneously overweight and malnourished partly this is due to a lack of proper education about nutrients and the bodys needs as far as diet in our schools mainly though lets face it people love to eat crap from fast food to pork rinds to everything made from white flour like white bread and pasta to cheese cheese and more cheese i am a major cheese lover myself but heres the point that kind of diet consists of what we call empty calories yes youre getting the number of calories you need per day or more but they are of little use to your body as they contain little of the way nutrients your body needs which is one of the reason you feel hungry all the timeits not that you need more calories those constant cravings for more food are your bodys way of attempting to get the nutrients it needs salads steamed vegetables whole grains homemade juices plus supplements you have thoroughly researched so you know youre not getting ripped off and each given supplement actually does something important for your healththis is the way to go i have land i can build a substantial garden on so that i can grow an array of veggies now and during hard times i do take a variety of supplements,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacTlrV0hJWE1ESVBGSDVISXNFZTlWNWFITXBnaTI3bnpkTTRidFpRb0xFemJqX0ZSSFQ5bDd1Q0pfdjJ3cUcyczgxcXV0Mk5QRXNRMW4tR3RSd19ZeldBSnAzQVJSYmdJbEtiS0pQbnluUXM9

definitive statements can come back to bite people i think youre right in principle but emps which is just one component of a nuclear war but arguably the worst is very unlikely all the players involved have too much to lose mad still works that said the us did once nuke another nation and people are justifiably concerned that someone could try it again concentration camps in the us happened in my parents lifetime not in mine and i like to think the us has learned a lesson here but weve had families forcibly split up at our borders to discourage immigration some were never reunited weve had dangerous medical experiments tested on uninformed and unwilling subjects tuskegee experiments mkultra and predecessors weve had ordinary citizens spied on without oversight for decades and by various organizations in short we have a long history of rights violations and even deaths that dont make us look any better than concentration camps civil war in the us is wildly unlikely in any formal sense states are far too interdependent to allow it and most people by far simply arent that politically motivated but its not at all impossible that small groups would engage in acts of mayhem and call it civil war even though it wouldnt have the scope weve had a violent attempt to disrupt an election within the last decade and some groups have been openly targeted night club shootings harassment campaigns violence against leaders riots to make it obvious that while full on war isnt in the cards continued and escalating violence could be we dont have clean hands and were drowning in rhetoric and disinformation that has and will cause more trouble the only question is how many dominoes will fall youre right that these are all maybes and climate change is a certainty and already affecting the us problems with the grid are predicted to increase preventable though and the us has a clear problem with health care and infrastructure there are things way more important to prepare for than civil war and emps like retirement which is increasingly out of peoples reach and health crisises which drive a lot of bankruptcy in the us so while im not into the talk of doomsday its really obvious why people have grave concerns about the future i would not put money on a bet claiming that the us will suffer no major disruption in the next ten years crash no misery possible covid taught us that our social systems are poorly designed and the us could face far worse than covid supply chain issues someday i used to tell people that prepping for a week would get them though almost anything theyd ever face im up to a month now maybe in a few months id be recommending <number> months which would put prepping out of reach of most of the country i think that says something,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmtjZ0hLOFE5T1V3Zkh5ZGVoQUJwMm1PTFM3MmZzT3dSUkVsVTdETzN4X251emd1cjE5X05JVkVxSVY2bkp3cFpGMDlQTEJXa2Q0aEZFemkyakRJNllHMm1VZlhtZjlIMEJkQ21GdHdkX1U9

in canada it is illegal to carry anything for the intended purpose of selfdefence the exact same bogstandard folding knife carried by two different people could have one charged while the other walks away without a care depending on how each answers the question thats why both folding knives that i have as edcs are liberally contaminated with dried fruit juices while i wash them just before the fruiting season starts so they are appropriately sanitary i make sure to use them with the last of the apples that i eat straight from the tree and to not wash them afterwards to ensure that it is bleedingly obvious i use them for cutting apart fruit in particular someone carrying bear spray or dog spray is going to be very intensely interrogated by the rcmp because anyone carrying these products on the regular is likely carrying them to use them against another person,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzNJZm1VV3NXS1ZKTW96S2J1V2Rpa2tJR1MxMG1iYUJoYzYwMTJ1Z2prbEpOUl9aTXlEc2x5ZTRXQWl5TFotT29mSmxETkF3bU1rclM4alVtNzh6bnc9PQ==

the article is basically bullshit the author first suggests that some societies do not gender people as men with penises women with vaginas and that that means that rape doesnt occurs which is wrong because however a society genders or does not gender does not change whether a person with a penis can force it into a person with a vagina she also spends pages and pages saying that a society the gerai that she lived with values men and women equally despite admitting that that same society considers men as higher then women and accords a womans word only <number>s that of a mans in a court setting she then claims that despite that same society telling her that they had a history as headhunters that they are nonviolent and that they were more likely prey for headhunters than headhunters themselves she goes on to claim that the tribe sees each others sexual organs male and female as exactly the same and argues that rape could not happen between people whose sexual organs are the same yet also admits that so far as she saw they only had heterosexual sex odd that if they considered all their sexual organs exactly the same they never not once to her knowledge ever had homosexual sex huh kinda suggests they could tell the difference in the end she shows one thing that what we call rape the gerai would not recognize as rape but would instead see as basically in inappropriate misstep in a courting ritual an expression of need that was not responded to with nurture she also suggests that in her view people with penises never forcibly insert them into people with vaginas among the gerai because she never heard of such a thing happening and no one would admit to her that such a thing had happened out of the community of <number> that she lived with well we all know how small communities work and when you have a community full of women who have been trained to not even know of the concept of rape then its no surprise that when men force themselves on them rape them that they interpret that as nothing but an inappropriate misstep in a courting ritual or a nonreturned expression of need but that doesnt change the fact that from the very first page there is strong evidence that gerai men do sometimes force their penis into vaginas owned by women who do not wan them and that whether or not they call it rape it is most obviously by our definitions rape,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRTVBUEVTemRfS3p3d0dYWTU1WTk1OGxvMUNlVW1HWS1PWVk0VHZDaHY0a2dYQ2pjdmVod0dyZFhSRUZrV3lLcUxVMlloRGRXdEFwdktRQ1A2bmRaWXc9PQ==

japanese blades are trash tier the reason japanese swords were folded so many times is because they had shit metal so they had to fold it to beat out all the impurities its also a blade that you have to train with to cut the shape of the blade means you have to hit in just the right spot at just the right angle to cut effectively with it theyre also very weak blades and will break from any kind of abuse stupid idea aside if you absolutely had to have some kind of blade then just get a decent quality machete you can pry open doorswindows with it chop fire wood smash windows etc and failing that you could take a chunk out of someone if you were that way inclined its also small enough to swing inside a building a decent machete will do things that will make a japanese sword cry without even losing its edge,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN19YU2R3MkcwUm1RTmk0VUtyMWRjTUFRSC04VGNGczVoT3lybHNHVjg1ZXF0SFV3SGQtNDcyNWtCX1N3ZDdfME5ubEc4TlZ2M0dzRE9vNVloRzNxSkE9PQ==

fundamentally i can see the sentiment but i dont think swords make sense personally i means swords are close ranged weapons and i would hate to bring a sword to a gun fight you could say but what about indoors or confined spaces where ranged weapons dont have an advantage swords are not great here either they are too awkward also since its kind of a single purpose item i doubt you would even carry it and actually have it when you actually needed it i think a large knife or a hatchetshort axe would be more practical and durable if i had literally no other option,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY1RrbEdpTUpiSFZQSkExV21Db0J4VGdGYUFwNEdEWnRpZXllUGhpZ2xaQU14UE1Oc056V3lwTWZiM0xYd0pFTU9IRWJFaTg5Z1dPSHItZlMybVgzT1E9PQ==

it really depends on what youve got prepped and how many you are cooking for ive seen and gotten multiple different cookbooks over the years a lot of it is not particularly useful for this dont get me wrong its good to have misc recipes amounts times but its rare that i actually have all the items in those recipes and i usually dont and wouldnt eat those recipes anyway the vast majority are for full kitchenbest case scenarios and not low powercamping stoveetc i think its better to actually take cooking courses for the basics can watch youtube videos as well search for cooking basics from culinary schools ton of stuff there once you have the basics you can usually figure out what to do with what you have with more confidence that said if you want to prep in advance there are youtube channels where they go over one bagboxjar meal preps you can plan out a few days in advance and have all your components in one bag in advance some examples ive seen before check their channels for more these are not <number><number>+ year solutions btw wicked prepared<url> pantry meal kits for budget recession proof meals<url>,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMEpZVU5BYWJJaFN5aUFDY25pbVhqQlBWM19yQ20xV2pqTUM5M1Jfb3I3V1ZxSGszN2lKcktwRTk2bjBZVWNhaV9hRWFzV1lPVVM5a1oxRGQ5WE5YOHc9PQ==

i think they would serve an important role like everyone else i am not too familiar with the scope of training or skillset of an emt to be completely honest i can speak much better to the role of a cna cna training is very basic and focuses on assisting patients with activities of daily living toiletingchanging bathing feeding ambulating taking vital signs blood sugars measuring urine output etc they also assist nurses with certain tasks like basic wound care changing iv dressings and some places allow them to do phlemobotomy a nurse medic or doctor would be fully capable of performing the role of a cna but there is probably a better use of a paramedic nurse or doctors time and knowledge in a shtf scenario so i would say that the cna skillset would be valuable in the same way they are valuable now to provide direct care to people in need and to free up nursesmedicsdoctors to provide the more advanced care many cnas and i would guess emts could be taught the knowledge and skills to do more advanced care over time also that isnt to say that anyone is above assisting people with activities of daily living as a nurse i still regularly help people with toileting changing etc but i if i spent all of my time doing that as its a neverending job providing basic care to those who cant do it for themselves i wouldnt be able to effectively perform my duties as an rn,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUnBLblZxbjN5czdpaUdRYWxPMUJaendyVG9IT0RiM0FQcFBMQmd0QkpvYkZJWE9TVUViSERrTzFNTERsdUlUcFI0eFN0RTdFYUZDT3Y2NjdZX3FoUFE9PQ==

radiation is energy or charged particles ejected from a nucleus at high speed you dont filter the radiation you filter the materials that emit it chemically those materials behave exactly the same as their nonradioactive counterparts some materials like gross fallout particulates can be filtered via very simple filters like sand other materials like radium might need a carbon filter still other radioactive materials like iodine and cesium require more sophisticated removal methods like ionexchange which is how a water softener works finally some materials like radon kenon and krypton cannot be filtered out because theyre inert part of the noble gasses they are removed through agitation and offgassing so you see its not as simple as hey buy our radiation water filter it really depends on what it is in the case of this filter it looks like theyre talking primarily about radium radon uranium etc in water you cant really filter gross alpha or gross beta you can filter the materials emitting them so if youre thinking about buying this to use after a radiological emergency nuclear war etc im not sure its going to do exactly what youre thinking it will its hard to say because id have to see more information on the filter because the information they provide is pretty vague if you had high radon or radium content in your drinking water which some wells do it might work fine for that might it be better than nothing i dunno maybe the general rule with water consumption after a nuclear event like a war is that if you need water drink water even if its contaminated because dehydration will kill you far faster than the radioactive materials will so even if it doesnt remove all of the contaminants maybe it will get some or most of them as i said before fallout is fairly easy to filter but its a complex mix of hundreds of different materials fused with soil sand seabed ocean minerals etc depending on where it was formed so because of that some of the materials may dissolve off in the water and may not be captured by the filter also the likelihood of you developing acute radiation sickness because youre drinking contaminated water is virtually nil if the water is that contaminated its likely youre receiving a substantial external dose because youre out of shelter in heavy fallout conditions and will die anyway hopefully some of that info helps,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhN0ZoZkg2bExXWG1WcDAteDFReEFsZ3k1aW9YWkFfT1dhRmx1VlBsYXJPeWpBdGpFUjltZWQxN2Y4QlItWHg2cUpZdFN4Z3VUQXpxNmVwcVVlTkNpLVE9PQ==

one thing i hear a lot is a small motorcycle or bicycle to get around stranded cars on one prepper show i saw of a business that set people up for their version of shtf some guys in an apartment got an inflatable boat to get out of the city as that was the fastest way and it fit in their apartment they sold them baseball bats to fight to the river if they had to lol because no guns in that city i know it was just a show but im brain storming you want money for a motel after you get far enough away maybe cash and a hidden card in case you get robbed for the cash some water maybe a food brick or something so you dont get too lightheaded a water filter would be good if you will have water to filter on the way first aid kit for bigger problems like gauze stop bleed stuff and like an israeli bandage not just a bunch of bandaids there might not be help available for a bit not a whole camping set up but like a waterproof blanket or bag and tarp maybe if it might take more than a day to get somewhere else i got this foam blanket with silver on one side thats pretty warm for its size and weight that might be good for that if all you have to do is get a couple days away from it its way different than running off to live in the woods i wouldnt want to be in one of the buildings they torched in the summer of protests i saw one they were stopping emergency response from getting to the building as protest also,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUDFWT3JZLTJESlI5TXhONzdvRzYwSEljY1JBVElSREN0dmZhcy01dmhqU01KcVEtUzczUktJdWtlVzlZMzc4UVdmcEFTX3FKd0k4ejRPSm9rZmFKQmc9PQ==

i live in a rural area but some of these concepts are the same i have a bug out bag and plan on having to do a fair amount of running through the woods so i keep a couple of energy bars in my bag and i can even eat those while running youre going to burn a lot of calories all at once so youre going to be very hungry within hours and this is such a simple way to solve that later i can deal with how i feed myself the next day in your bag should also be a good flashlight with new batteries you may be running at night which is hard to do if you cant see the ground you might even prefer a headlight i also suggest an easy to reach can of bear spray just to get people away from you not in your bag you may need to get that while running i can actually swap my bag around so its on my chest and in that position its easy for me to draw my gun which is hidden on the side facing my chest its a holster on the outside of the bag the rest of the bag that i can think of should be location related i have a map and a compass to navigate through the woods where there is no cell reception if its still working at all but you probably dont need that,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheUVXaEpWNWVQZHNuVmdOd2h1WjRrYUpVM1ZBMHplNko3OFZrbHk1dElib09YN1RHTnFzZURKcUFFQmphWUxEVE9lMEFOaU45YzNjbGdsZEprc0RYVFE9PQ==

list of various ideas i have collected over the years so what you choose of this list is of course dependent on your actual living situationi wet wipesbabywipes for washing no showering collect rain water or get water from the nearest river in buckets for flushing your toilet or get a bag of catsand and park a plastic bag in the toilet throw some catsand over the stool after use tie a knot when full and throw in the trash or bury the contents far away from food producing areas gross but dying of thirst is no comparison try to use paper plates and plastic cutlery to avoid washing up when you have to wash up reuse the water as many times as possible collect it and then use it to flush the toilet use a cylindrical thingypipe to lead the water from washing your hands into a bucket for flushing the toilet you can cut up a plastic bottle and shape it as you ned for this job air out clothes instead of washing them good luck,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRWxTNW8zMjF6bHRuNmIwaVBGSkpYNjhMSi1pakZPQk9tcmI3aTVsSHplUFZfOElRT284aWhuUnlla2M3cjYwdXhXS3lqM2Vja1ZPV2ljNHM0LWNPM1E9PQ==

i think the first signs will be economic and political if you look through history economic issues become political issues which escalate into much worse issues as pandering and corrupt politicians propose simple solutions to complex problems that actually make things worse when these solutions dont work they typically double down or blame corrupt and evil elements within that society to deflect away from their own ineptitude look for things like a declining standard of living growing wealth inequality corruption inflation government debt and money printing political polarization and political unrest increased use of propaganda and lies from government sources populous leaders promising simple solutions implementing laws aimed at cutting cost via brute force ignoring economic realities like rent caps or subsidies retoriric singling out classes of people or foreign governments to blame for internal problems declining infrastructure which is put off to fund more visible and people pleasing initiatives,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNFJieHg1d2xrc2Y3dUhTanRGYmx6cThHLWh6azQ1R1NsZ0RNRjR6SHpYRWhTR2sxSUM3S21ERVFIdTN0QWkzaEJfLWtHNU5LWVprdnViOFhXSzhFTnc9PQ==

from this post of mine <url><url> do you need a global needle simple answer not unless you plan to travel near the poles and even then you can just hold your compass at an angle and verify the needle is freely balanced due to the shape of earths magnetic field the pull sotospeak on your compass needle is not always evenly pitched and changes as you approach the poles to counter this global needles relocate the ferrous part nearer the fulcrum and have plastic north and south pointers instead with a standard compass the ends of the needle are interacting with earths field so where the earths field is pulling at too steep an angle it can unbalance a standard needle in a global compass its near the center to reduce that effect normal compasses work perfectly fine in either hemisphere the only thing you ever have to do is adjust for declination as i explained here <url><url> and heres a video explaining what a global compassneedle is <url><url>,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSGpsWk15ME9wdnBTaGFsWUNJZ3ozQmNydWxybkprT3d2NGxRSWpWTW9fX0ZfS2N1U1A0czRxN3F6S2pfX1p2cFBTM0s3emZGYnpSaTNzcXd5NXdrcGc9PQ==

re emps and faraday cages copied and pasted from another forum although emp can be produced by several different methods the only manmade kind that is capable of causing widespread damage is produced by detonating a nuclear weapon at a very high altitude typically referred to as hemp every other form of emp weapon is either a mere laboratory curiosity or has a range too small to be useful against anything other than small specific military targets some examples of these other nonnuclear emp missiles and ebombs are described here<url> and here<url> so unless you happen to live next door to an extremely highvalue military target hemp is the only kind of emp weapon youre ever likely to be within range of hemp does its damage by inducing a very brief highvoltage spike in electrical devices this spike can be strong enough to burn out wiring punch through the thin semiconductor layers in transistors diodes and computer chips or cause the software in computercontrolled devices to go haywire hemp energy is mostly concentrated at the low end of the radio frequency spectrum ie well below <number> mhz<url> because of this trait only fairly long electrical conductors ie ac power lines phonecableinternet lines big antennas etc are capable of receiving a hemp pulse in any significant strength physically short conductors make very inefficient antennas for receiving the low frequencies produced by the hemp pulse so they do not generate much of a voltage spike in devices that arent connected to any long conductors little or no voltage spike is generated due to hemp and so the device is unlikely to be damaged most small electronic devices ie cell phones portable radios pdas laptop computers digital wristwatches flashlights electronic combination locks on safesred dot sights etc would fall into this category the few inches or fractions of an inch of conductors present in these devices is simply too short to intercept any significant amount of the hemp pulse which means that no spike is generated within them that is sufficient to cause damage this also means that faraday cages arent of much use against hemp because just about any device that is small enough to fit inside a practical faraday cage is too small to be affected by hemp anyway the other naturallyoccurring kind of emp is produced by solar flares or geomagnetic storms and is even lowerfrequency than hemp which means that a conductor needs to be many miles long<url> to be affected by it some examples hightension power transmission lines gas pipelines undersea cables copper not fiber and back in the old days telegraph lines other shorter conductors are mostly unaffected solar flares do not produce any of the fastrising highvoltage e or e spikes that hemp produces in electrical conductors<url> so personal electronics are not affected by it note that satellites can be damaged by solar flares since theyre outside the part of the earths atmosphere that provides some shielding from solar radiation radio signals can also be affected particularly in parts of the radio frequency spectrum that normally rely on bouncing signals off some layer in the earths atmosphere to make them travel long distances once again faraday cages are useless against solar flares because any device small enough to fit inside a practical faraday cage is too small to be affected by solar flares anyway,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLThfZzZkeWF4eks2UkFWZTQ0YlF4ZEhOWHRFUVNWVEQ3YUtKZTF4SU9rR09mbWZacUpGazgtVDYwNl9FcnI2TGpkOUZwZDg3YWRDeW9UNEFIa3lmOFI4cUhvc3VKeXhOZTFsa1BwZExuMnM9

well the possibility of a military invasion is close to <number> it sounds like you live in a rural area so the residual effects of civil unrest will probably hit you last unless people are fighting in the streets you might be jeopardizing your employment early it sounds like you hate your job so go get a different one dont wait for a scenario that will probably never happen in our lifetime we dont live in a red dawn movie,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaGpXNUtYVXI2MEN6dTN0TkdhVG9FV0lkWk9mMl9NS1oyTHprc3NRNkRIcm96MGVtRkM3SjVzUlgycWRUQ0RSMFVOWHJPUUVYYk9KSXJBOVYxVnhoNzZYSmpqbUc0OWxJYm1hNTM0dTFEYUk9

id say for your question the best source is the news im not from the us so i dont know about the weather part but i would guess major anticipated events get at least some coverage so on that front if you pay attention you should be aware if thats not the case there are also weather alerts apps that you can install on your phone and probably some that can cover multiple locations so that you could also be aware of how things are going for your relatives the second one in my opinion is civil unrest and overall people being dumb idiots for that second one i think the media is even more important some stories blow up and some dont why did george floyd create such a massive reaction while there has been many stories like this one overall its simply because many people get aware of a specific story and react to it by watching the news youll be able to know at the same time as whoever might react to it to do dumb shit its true for riots and looting but its also true for big fires for example empty stores and gas stations or things like this if you can anticipate the news will drive many people to do the same thing and youre prepared and dont need to do that same thing then you can just figure out if you need to pack and leave or stay and wait for it to calm down,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndHBFQ1pkd2JHN3ZPTEFOR3lIaTlhQkE1MW9JcVlsZ0FYaHB0TlBSUGZYa0JDQ0M5XzlpeV9tMmVSblZmLUd1R05iNU9nZFRIcmFUbmtxcDBnYk96QVE9PQ==

in addition to all the other great suggestions i would ensure that i had respirators or at a very bare minimum n masks for each of my family respirators with decent vocrated filters will allow you to manage smoke or teargas situations find them or ns in the paint section of hardware stores eye protection like swim goggles or ski goggles are important for those scenarios too,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTEk3dUd2eUNCSWlURUNDNFpEcC1zTXdSNm1YYnRLRU9NWGV3X2Z5WHhXekhucU5ENmpnd1BTQ0Z6TmtJOHNQN1NZMDdhQVRKdWhqeFY3MWw2b0Nmc3c9PQ==
depends if you have access to antibiotics infection is what causes the excruciating pain it inflames and creates pressure on the root of the tooth as someone who has had tooth problems before i would suggest investing in a water pick its very good for flushing out an infection in a tooth but can take days of repeated use using it <number> to <number> times a day on the infected tooth but it will eventually get rid of the infection,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndXZjTE5KVVllMXJ1QVB2bmtOTGMxWkZreC1QOV9rMEdKV2hUd0RRUGo1OXZ6NWkxVXdidldCc0l3QnVmRjRlWlY2clRDVVFBZElRRUxwVzFtTWxYUkE9PQ==

it sounds like the author was it an ai got confused between emp and cme halfway through specifically cmes generate low frequency energy but hemps have been described as dc to daylight and other sites talk about hundreds of mhz at that point a quarter wave antenna is a few inches well within the range of copper traces on circuit boards and depending on the circuit you dont need to induce much voltage to do damage modern processors have been known to lose their minds at overvoltages of v the faster the processor generally more fragile the electronics this isnt to say that commercial faraday cages are any good most dont tell you what frequencies they were tested at with so many unknowns the right answer is a faraday shield not a cage a proper shield means you dont have to worry about what the actual frequency range is and it can be built with a metal trash can tight metal lid and conductive tape to seal it up or if youre really careful wrap your items in multiple layers of metal foil leaving no tears holes or gaps ill point out as i always do that shielding your electronics really isnt all that relevant a series of emp attacks on the us means the grid is coming down hard substation transformers exploding even power lines melting irrespective of what other electronics die this is a long term death for the grid because without the grid you cant manufacture replacement parts youre also it needs to be pointed out at the start of a nuclear war about the only electronic device i can think of of any use is a standalone solar powered computer with your reading material on it anything using radio wifi cell system ham is probably gone because it was hooked to antennas and power lines when the emp hit so put whatever you want in your trash can faraday shield but it may not have much to talk to after the war also dont open the trash can until the war is definitely over you dont know the emps have stopped until then,r/preppers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnck1LNXB5eHduRWNpMlRTaXFBTDhBczZrakZtM09XSDZoX3NMLXZNSWtkVHRibjJRYnNlTVFLLUlQdDB4aXJySlY4MGlYa3diYnJWQXJpXzJLT2Q3cFE2eUwzamMyemVIa1JBTTZWZFBQYnc9
