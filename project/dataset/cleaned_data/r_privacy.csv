are you sure that you are looking for privacy or more of anonymity or for security if you are looking for only privacy then you probably should use any distro that you like then opt out of their automated data collection what remains is your part you should not expect any distro to guard you from being identified when you use chrome while googling a product that would expose you unless you use a lot of stuff to anonymize yourself a simple thing to do to avoid being exposed is to use librewolf and containerize search sessions thats for only browsing next if you install any proprietary software like zoom that would also expose you but you cant really avoid using zoom when your company is enforcing it there are a lot of other stuff but i think browsing would be <number>+ of what would allow them to identify you,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZS3pHN2FyY0ItcDZVSGxmQTQyRjliMk80ZlM4bWxhVHBsaWxuZGlLaTUzaGhIUTBIUFRRMXFfamY0RnBqdjI5QkJ1QURjc1ZWOUdWUDh6VGxENEw4WXJ0RG1hZ05mN3lEQjQyUEZ6N09PVHM9

some people advocate using super anonymous stuff without good understanding which actually backfires as very few people use their special method and would lead to them being identified anonymizing is a hard subject after the degree you have reached linux plus a privacy enhanced browser anymore than that would force you to have deeper understanding on what happens under the hood and the common problems people faces while trying to maintain privacy such as how the great chinese wall blocks most vpn and how some of them suddenly works for a limited period or what is manifest v and why it is a bad idea i think those are some fun subjects that i think would benefit you,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRnZYMzRPel8yTGhNbHZrNkJBZkhMYmJGX3NqWWpHMEtDSkRrUGVqMC1md2E2d2htMzhDbzFmZVNXZkhyZ1JMckZnbFVYY3BsSVZfekN6V3FvSlBuaGNHdDVYakU3WWxTWGt3YkQtd3pjNnM9

i am eternally grateful for having been paranoid enough from the start to never post face photos to any online service i mean the fuckers have managed to link everything i do together anyway and a portion of my social network major platforms at least mainly social media and common email addresses and contacts etc then there is every arsehole ive ever known who has uploaded my contact details to big data companies through invasive app permissions without my consent and everyone who has posted photos of me to social media without my consent i have to my utter disappointment uploaded face photos to dating app companies for verification and recently fucking seaworld to buy an online yearly pass waste of money i hate the place and i dont trust them simply having a drivers licence in my country means facial biometrics have been added to a govt database and i dont trust their data security at all haha i know people who work for govt departments responsible for citizen data and yeah no and now they want to force everyone to use a digital national id and centralise all medical records etc also cctv everywhere recording me services requiring voice print verification wtf guys i even found myself in some serious legal trouble when i was much younger and the company responsible for data storage and security accidentally posted my full name and details on their public website in an advertisement for their services massively breaching privacy laws unfortunately a family member discovered it and threatened them and didnt get any evidence otherwise i would own a house fml there is no escape from this shit and what is already out there despite my best efforts is out of my control not that its worth giving up im holding on to every last piece of privacy i have they will have to claw my consent out of my cold dead hands but its increasingly already totally full blown state level adversary spy level opsec just to keep anything private with all of the inconvenience and social exclusion that comes with it thats been the main downfall for me i held out as long as i could but i ended up sacrificing personal opsec for social inclusion and much desired convenience and connection and paid a price im not happy with a price that seems wholly unimportant to most which ill never understand im currently assessing where im at and the work that will be required to completely abandon anything that links to my current footprint within my capacity which i will do just building up the spoons to map out a schema of contextual identities and start thinning out whats already on the playing field to the best of my ability but have to maintain all of the life shit which takes up most of my bandwidth like everyone else trying to keep themselves from drowning but as ive alluded to can have all the personal opsec in the world but cant control other people my current housematelandlord has a ring doorbell security cameras out the back and everything connected to fucking wifi shes going full on smart home like i need to use an app to turn the fucking lights on and off anyway thats my rant for the morning haha ditch the competition they are farming you like cattle tell them to go fuck themselves and move on best we can do is choose the few companies that do respect their users and take measures to protect ourselves from companies that are user hostile probably makes little difference in the end but its still worth fighting back,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeGNzeFdZWEJEVVdvdDUzQ2lPdTJkOThqM3dFWWVCdEJoWDdSX1p4c0ZoRExqSDhGXzAyRlMtSWM3Z2hoTGFJR2VUOEd6Q2dzWDBwREx6alpQRnczUE1lU2VmYW12bGtVMHQ2NFg2aGpSZmc9

if you were actually unknowingly unintentionally running even just teamsviewer anydesk and ammyadmin simultaneously you would be very very hacked pretty sure even an av that hasnt been updated since <number> would flag some evidence of intrusion somewhere and like i said stp ulv and lit arent widely known acronyms they could refer to variants of specific malware but it would be pointless to disclose those tags without the rest of name detection is always either too sensitive leading to more false positives or too insensitive leading to more false negatives the more risk adverse approach that banks prefer is to tune it to be too sensitive and then manually sort legitimate findings from fp but that is a lot more time consuming and skill demanding and can lead to alert fatigue where detections get ignored its an overall worse user experience just occasionally preferable since a single false negative can destroy a system while many false positives can be managed unless a false positive causes someone to throw their device out a window then it has led to a full compromise of the system anyway the shared responsibility model here is a bit illdefined tbh the bank cant validate their detection without access to your system you cant validate it either without access to their alert,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNG1yRTZJcUFMbE1zOHlsRUhfOENiSnNKOGk5Z1RlNHloVE4xRm5WR2UzMGI0dW91Y2psekVUNzVHM1ZMMktJZUlwVnZqLUQ5RDRndVQ0Ti02MnZSclE9PQ==

when people ask for privacy focused something they usually mean avoiding mass data collection on them the sad news though is that one can only minimize it to a certain extent but its impossible to completely avoid tldr you use your computer to consume online services and its impossible to consume a service without exposing your usage historypatterns to a service provider that may share your data with whomever os is only one of many things that may leak your data outwards others are for example isp vpn provider apps like your browser or zoom websites your phone its os apps and mobile operator your smart tv with all the streaming services subscriptions other peoples devices in your household and office were lucky to have linux and its many distros that dont spy on us which we can reasonably be sure of but all the other things above are impossible to foolproof against apart from simply not using them at all which ironically enough would render your computer and its os practically useless,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWHpseENhYWJjVWM3OEVJc1ZoYXMtS2xWeWpuRWttUkV5VWRNYzFKT0NFQTNfdDJzZXpmYXJiankwU21aNWVpNTJFYkVEM1JIOGJrTHoyVjVSaUpJWHdTUXU0MGtJY1RNZE9wclZlT2J0dFU9

the purpose is not a single purpose password + totp even if totp is in the same password manager as the totp improves against some threats thats what matters what threat models are mitigated by measures password + totp makes it so that if the password is compromised the totp still protects the account that means if someone steals the password phishes the password or the sites password database is compromised etc the account stays secure because of the existence of totp also a lot more people are likely to start using their crappy password + totp even if they dont switch to a password manager fully there was a solid number of years where i was using my basic password + totp in an app authy at the time you are correct that some scenarios are not mitigated by having totp if totp is not stored securely a compromise of my password manager is still bad since it leaks my password and my totp but i think the distinction between something you know something you have and something you are is a bit arbitrary at the end everything translates into <number>s and <number>s so everything is at the end of the day something you know or something that is knowable fido passkeys are used to sign challenges the passkey itself is just a very very very long something you know locking something you know into a tpm and using hardware safety measures to prevent access without biometrics doesnt make a private encryption key something you have instead of something you know its something you know but that you dont have personally memorized which is saved somewhere that protected by biometrics biometrics also arent something you are they are something you are which is transformed by sensors into zeros and ones which is something that is knowable lets say my face scan done with apple equipment results in <number> as the scan result so then the scan result of <number> is used as a password to access the passkey which is also something you know that being said its less about things being something you know or something you are but rather having ways of storing credentials that are not likely to be compromised at the same time for better security something like a yubikey is great its a separate hardware module that is intentionally difficult to copy clone and while it is still something you know private encryption keys stored on something that is difficult to extract from making it much more like something you have than a lot of other options out there at the end of the day computers cant interact with something you have or something you are they only interact with information bits so what you have and what you are needs to be converted to data somehow since that process is not exact ie it wont read the same exact values every time on fingerprints or face scans there needs to be some probability matching in the validation and that means that the credentials need to be protected by the hardware and software of the thing that is storing them and it is still possible to brute force biometrics since at the end its data it isnt something you are <url> but by hardening the storage of these things it reduces the threat surface and thats what matters,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNackRjZEVrcVVwaDhkcDNMVzh4eWk3S1BIUnNKS2Jkc2tMWG9ZOTlIaUVpaF8xcEVralVrdlVsdElzYTBQb01ITVpWSHJVVmNVZ21YRGNBZHdiVlZ2T3c9PQ==

look into the snowden leaks if you want to learn about things the government uses on everyone the one positive about things like pegasus is that its in horrible monster companies like nsos best interest to keep their exploits as closely guarded secrets as possible so they can continue to profit off of them if an exploit becomes too widespread it is far more likely to be patched out this is why you will often hear privacy advocates talking about building a threat model if you are say a journalist with information that might be sensitive to a nation or multi national business same thing am i right s but not really then pegasus or similar things are definitely near the top of your threat model if you are a more average person without an specific reason to be targeted your threat model is more wide net type surveillance things like online tracking large scale data leaks simple and reused passwords etc,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadWJvVU1qRnhjOWhEcnIxMzB5aEQ1VEZBQmNmWWZJVUNOQ011bFF3VEl6Rnh3TUR5MmN1c1psN2dJU3FlaVVlb2JwY1ZOZ2lGUzZ1VmZXMzNjdmh6bWxJdjZvN296TXFwQ00zc1F4cVVwM0k9

it depends firefox has cookie isolation in that cookies and trackers from different sites are unable to interact with eachother however google cookies and trackers are on pretty much every site out there if you are logged into youtube and navigate to a site which uses google analytics your browsing is correlated to your account best practice is to clear cookies and login information on browser exit you can make use of firefoxs container feature so that youtube and reddit are isolated in a container this will allow you to stay logged in for ease of use but sandbox your usage of them from the rest of your browsing activity,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNGczaHEzUHhobkxrRktITkRjVFlMNnZXOWQ5SEMwQzNlNFd3SjZnbHp0NF9JRWxoOXVtUFVESXR6TnFKV1M5N1RjLTgwNWJKY3NzT3ItRkpXZDZQOGc9PQ==
the strangest thing just happened i was using chatgpt for some coding help it gave a bunch of code and used it then i made some modifications to the code at the same time i kept going back to chatgpt to tell it to make improvement on the code there were a few lines of code that i changed to make it easier to test the code for my self i made a very small change basically i changed a line from using some variable to use just a set number <number> in this case and i changed another value to be just the word hello i was using the chatgpt code in tinkercad for arduino i asked chatgpt to make some modifications to the code but never told it that i used these specific values and never asked it to change the way the code was tested yet it gave me the same exact values that i used in tinkercad it might be my conspiracy hat on but it is one hell of a coincidence that it used these exact values when i never told it about it so can chatgpt access some of the cookies that are in our browsers or something cahtgpt u looking mad sus right now,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelJjU2Y0TE9Bb3ppWkktNzVfc2RxVU1FNUpmbUF5OUdraExMTy03REp6VVc2bUNlSU1haFE3enNiRFQ0aXYzajNqdTdXS2x4LXNWR09ucEozLUFNQ1E9PQ==

first thing to remember is you are uninteresting no one is bruteforcing or otherwise progressively attacking your accounts to gain access your most likely attack vesctor is a databreach of a website you use the key here is to use a unique password for eaxh website such that a databreach doesnt give someone your password to another service best approach make up a word i like to combine multiple swearwords into one then create a nickname for the website you use made up word followed by your nickname is the password for that site boom you now only need to remwmber one password and you have a trivial way to remember a a unique password example made up word spunt password for facebook spuntbluebook password for twitter spunttweetz,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYTVLQ0FaMGFISUZlZ3lKMUo1bm0tbmx1Y0VNY0U4b3FtZ1V0b1NZM0oyMGRRSGJmTC05OEwwcG5Celc0V3VvbkprdGMtN0xsb1I4SEstQmdDZUNSYUE9PQ==

for someone new to linux proton or dual booting is going to be way less of a headache gaming vms need access to your physical gpu usb ports audio devices etc the setup process uses pcie passthrough requiring being comfortable with cli and a fair amount of libvirt configuration linux is able to support most modern games using the proton tool made by steam the main compatibility issue nowadays is with multiplayer anticheat rather than games inherently not working the only real risk with dual booting is windows overwriting your linux bootloader but this only happens if both oses are on the same drive and it was more common on older storage formats if you want to be cautious throw in a separate secondary drive for linux and itll be fine,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRll3VVFUTnNTb0k2RHhLUTVBdHBBeUo5QmxoVEE1ZGprU00zQ3BmV1p4dzBIdHFOdTVWaEZKaC1CR1RpbjhXbFoxcGVQZ0pPdUppZTd6RTh5anZ6VE45ZTByZ29jVVRYcWF4a01BaHJENlk9

it doesnt have to be your siblings it could be anyone in your extended family i believe they caught the killer by testing the dna they found on the crime scene from the cold case files on an ancestry site like andme then the site came up with some distant relatives who also used the service from there law enforcement were able to build out an extensive family tree and through deductive reasoning determine that only one person in the family was living in califonia during the time of the murders they then tracked him going about his everyday business and when he finished drink a soda and threw it away in the trash they retrieved the cup and straw and swabbed for dna the dna indeed ended up matching the cold case dna and thats how they caught him so there was actually a lot of detective work involved but certainly testing the dna on ancestry was what broke the case open if you have any member of your extended family who has used a service like this than your dna or at least part of it has already been recorded and databased,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ1NHb1NDaUp4SHR5UnEwR3hBdW9HNDMxNE9STnJQR0RTYV9VSkotN3pQNmpEZ2l0SXo3UXZUOGI3SHNVWWs3NTV4dENIX250ZVk3ZlhfTklQVEdkM1E9PQ==

although this claim was a bit too extreme to be believable there are occasional instances where businesses do things like this in misguided attempts to correct other problems so i can kind of understand where someone might not think to question it in the past year google did something like this with their imagegenerating ai secretly injecting words into peoples prompts on the backend in order to encourage their model to produce more people of color they did this because their model was heavily biased toward disproportionately portraying white people when prompts didnt otherwise specify ethnicity but their ham fisted fix led to the ai changing the ethnicity of historical figures which resulted in even more bad press for them its good that they wanted to correct a bias especially since people on their ai ethics team before they scrapped said team had already publicly identified this specific example of bias a decade prior but they went about solving it in the laziest way instead of trying to address the underlying problems,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhOV9fbmF0SXNsRDhfd21YbU1GTXhWTFhpRFAxdUktdldwNy1VVFNtU2ptVjV4d0JiZWZUazJMZEJ2VEhEazdKemZvQ3BrTnRKYWFjcEFRRmI0TFRRREE9PQ==

i am listing things in no particular order of priority you will need to determine this for yourself but i would start with making sure you have all of your important documents before they find out hs diploma birth certificate social security card edit others also said vaccine records and voter info remove your parentsany family from all medical consent to speak with the cliniciansoffices and remove them as emergency contacts alert your medical providers that your mom may call pretending to be you to get your information etc so they can put a password and any other security measures in place consider getting your social security number changed and put a freeze on your credit once you move you will need to file a police report and this is important because it makes a paper trail for if they try to stalk or physically harm you and you will need to ask for a restraining order if they attempt to escalate and abuse further if organized and able and willing enough consider leaving the temptation to stalk you open so that you have legal recourse and evidence so they will let you do a restraining order but that may mean they will know your place of residence also you will need to get your information removed from publicly available sites if you need to go as far as changing your name you should consider it even if just last name alert your school if in college and your work as well and tell them whats happening so if anyone calls asking if you work there when you worketc or ask info in any way about you they have a plan and answer in place to protect you also set up a new email for all of these changes leave the old email as a dummy email get your license plate and drivers license number changed if possible remove your face and palms from any social media and detag yourself or ask people to remove pictures of you they will eventually try to image search for your face if they are persistent enough talk to a lawyer also to help you do this process in the right order keep in mind if they have the resources and desperation to try and find you you dont want a private detective looking for you either make sure they dont record you saying yes or anything even remotely angry or violent sounding at all idk how manipulative controlling and abusive they are but some people are legit this sneaky and scary i need to do similar but my issue is my parents have local state fed and mafia and gang connections at their disposal and friends w county judge so i have to grey rock instead its extremely scary i hope safety and a better life for you stay strong and stay smarter than them so sorry this is happening to you,r/privacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnT3A4X0RNT3Fmbmt4TkUybm1DU0dRNXlwOFNZM1NjdWhycmVrWHcxWWVJYU9XZnlSc1BZRG4yQks2blZiR3hEX1FxbXBjd09zdmVJTWx1WXNfWGpmdGc9PQ==
