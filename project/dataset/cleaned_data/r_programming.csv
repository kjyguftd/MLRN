yeah beyond the what every programmer should know about unicode<url> posts lurk the actual languages that are expressed in these strings to give an additional example norwegian and danish share the a letters but we sort them differently you should also sort the expansions as if there were the letter so in norwegian words starting with aa would be at the end of the list but preferably only in the cases where its actually a replacement for a so if the foreign word aardvark jordsvin earth swine has entered the list somehow it shouldnt be treated as a variant spelling of the fictitious word ardvark but aas absolutely should be treated as a variant of as people are accustomed to some incorrect sorting these days though and thankfully usually have access to some search rather than having to manually scan a list because sorting words is likely no easier than figuring out datetime<url>,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYelN1R3M1YVljYWdmX1A1WnA3TWxvRFE3bFo0UmdEdENCTUF4bHZvUldIaWZjenhxUENza0NhRFJ0QXVQemU4Q1ZtbFNpd3NGY1BJRGFOWlNtcGJBWXc9PQ==
thanks im going to ignore all the bits about how popular react is since thats not in question when i talk to clients about frameworks one of the first things i say is that its easiest to find developers and resources for react which is an important consideration for the longevity of any project so the advantages of alternative frameworks have to be strong enough to outweigh that > theres a lot of talk about react not being optimized and having performance problems but mostly this just boils down to inexperience with and misuse of the framework this is simply not true react is slow because it bypasses the web the rationale for doing so was comprehensible once upon a time but this became unnecessary a while ago > its capable of both simple and complex clientside applications spas and you can get started extremely quickly with tools like vite im not sure what about react specifically makes you feel this way apart from your familiarity with it > however isomorphic apps are not foolproof and have an enormous set of footguns sveltekit in particular has an enormous amount of issues ive evaluated it for several startups that and every time there are problems with its tooling or with the framework itself while nothing is perfect and ive had my struggles with sveltekit in the past twoway binding is still a major issue that cant be ignored i dont really know what to tell you except that i have used it and continue to use it today for many kinds of projects worked on by many kinds of developers with a couple of exceptions the problems ive encountered have been limited and fairly quick to deal with in contrast reacts limitations are by design > additionally it doesnt help that the svelte community is as defensive as the rust community sometimes pointing out sveltes failings on github ends up with well achkually moments which just turns people off i havent seen this but then i also rarely argue with people online about whose is bigger so ill defer to your experience in that department > in re to lit the web components ship has sailed web components are mostly a failed experiment and while there is somewhat good native browser support for them they have their own problems alright ill take a moment to address popularity here since that seems to be a recurring theme just as react is being used every day by multibillion dollar companies so are web components i dont know why you consider them a failed experiment when theyre a perfectly functional widelysupported and widelyimplemented means of encapsulating behaviour even with their shortcomings thats trivial to use in a much wider variety of scenarios than react is and can fit right in alongside any number of alternative approaches it seems like theyre a victim of their own success > the reactivity and data binding model for web components is not straightforward and css can be a massive pain that requires its own tooling ultimately most teams end up removing the css boundary and opt to use tools like tailwind with a singular stylesheet to compensate as a result the learning curve is super high with lit and web components its odd that you say the learning curve is high for lit and web components in the context of react i need to point out that if you think react is easy to learn and understand thats both because youre already familiar with it and because a lot of people have put a lot of effort into explaining it which i cant say for sveltekit or lit theres nothing inherently easy or straightforward about it in contrast to something like web components which build on html css and jstechnologies which are still easier to learn even taken together let alone individually and have much wider applications than just one framework and are ultimately unavoidable even with react it always puzzles me to see developers run to tailwind to avoid all the supposed complexity of css while gleefully embracing the likes of react the bottom line is that without intending to attack you personally given that youre hardly alone this sort of contempt for the fundamentals of the web and love for reinventthewheel frameworks like react are a big part of why the online experience is mostly bad today brittle slow unreliable inaccessible and hostile to the user i prefer the approaches of sveltekit and lit but im not suggesting theyre the ultimate solution just the best weve got right now,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbGszVWJ1VXEwRUY1OTgyZjJ6ZHpVTWJWRUxxREdoejhlY3lXZE9FQy1pdHM1S3YwUmFvaWE2Z3RXRUNoLUl1YkdyTGFSS2FDczgxT3NZcEc1VTE2TUE9PQ==

the way i look at it is that redis is your cache layer so that most of the backend is stateless if you have state in your backend and multiple instances you have to figure out a way to refresh the localperbackendinstance state one way would be to put a version on that state like schema version and keep that in redis this would work well it just feels like a massive overkill,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOWtjOExBNEZGbW81WU8zSE9VY0ZiQTFTS3FVYUtTbjNXUklfWDAtS0o2SFZHQkR3RmJZemhCZHlvWmpxeTFjam9ocXp3NDdORDJUSVpORVloSnZNSkE9PQ==

not at all but id recommend going through the napkin math resource i link at the end you can get basically all of the questions right by linking whats in the source code to the right latency number in the napkin math repo for example with the first python question you can break it down like this this is the simplest for loop possible in assembly code this loop would be only a few instructions a modern cpu can execute around <number> billion instructions per second actually more because of instruction pipelining but we dont need that detail here this is the napkin math number you need python is an interpreted language so the actual assembly for this python for loop would be a lot more than a few instructions lets say that python is at least x slower than a compiled language because of the interpreter vm overhead the overhead will be a lot higher actually in cases where the code is not as simple as this so that means <number> million loops per second not <number> billion the answer is <number> million so were close enough to get the question correct d,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTXczak1ySWR5X19mckRXbnhGUXFLZkVDN21OMXRhY3plNHFTWE9BNTVpYllPNGMtUzJrLTM2UGtxR3hvNUpNOWg4OU1WOTctWnIxLTRDanZPV0JVR3c9PQ==

hard disagree this is a super common need and is a particular weakness of graphql for example any ecommerce website lets take etsy for example its a product requirement that users can browse the shops without being logged in so they need to have access to basically all inventory and pricing unauthenticated this sort of setup tends to force graphql to put authentication around every field as the front end client largely controls the access patterns and the shapeamount of data coming back from the backend super painful and easy to screw up,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR2tqYzE5MFI4eDF2MVczeXFTN0hRQXA0S2haOUdzcjdubjdFeHQ0WDlxMkdSSTZkSmF0aHA0d1Qzc01Nak9WeFEzd1MxdWk2aGZxSUNMSFdfNm5YSEE9PQ==

the overall functionality looks sharp well done im not sure you really need to be so aggressive with the font colors in the tables see my comments below for the actual color values i love the use of shift to recursively expandcontract nice to have but not critical would be to change the chevron under the mouse cursor to bold style when the shift key is down to just confirm youre holding the right key down it would also be nice to drag the divider between the views so i could see more of one pane vs the other whats the purpose of the tree view in the right pane it appears exactly the same as formatted view with the addition of copy icons could you just put the copy icons in the format pane on the left and just remove the tree view im sure you have a good reason just saying it isnt clear in the formattree view the use of rgb for the font colors feels odd and too much something more subtle like having the labels be dark gray and the values be something else say dark red eg aa would be a bit calmer its not clear to me you need to show intnumbers in a different color but if you do a more subtle <number> would look better as well,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWktCYXk3S011dDE0OWhuUThFZE1KR1pZLWV3M3FWbEtDallHN2p4LTBUT0RnUjN0M243Wl9Rd0VBWEppZVozNVhkemtNNHVMaWdMaUI4TU9FNU1OY3c9PQ==

i personally worked at a multibillion dollar ecommerce company that had a graphql api for its shop of course we had caching but our main product api was definitely graphql it was a pain we sold digital assets think images for example so our catalogue was over half a billion items edit now was it smart you could definitely argue against it but lots of people who are moving to graphql dont want to keep around a separate rest api as a lot of the goal in moving to graphql is to move faster sorta defeats the point if you need to duplicate your backend endpoints the tendency of it all since authentication had to happen on a field by field basis is for business logic to move into the schema level which is probably not ideal,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcW9KR0ZWbElNaVMyQ3M0MmxXekZtM19WYXF1RUI4b2ZNN2x0ODJJdWN4V3RhQUYybU05YjUycklKeUNsWFBwUkpBZWNmNUtCRzNzVUVxTTYyalB2QVE9PQ==

multithreading introduces a whole lot of complexity especially regarding thread safety and data races whereas coroutines you decide howwhen to schedule them you can run coroutines in a thread pool like c does with async tasks or once every frame like unity does and like i demonstrate in this article or only when you receive some events in a queue or whatever pattern you can imagine since you are in control of the coroutines scheduling each tool has a purpose and multithreadings purpose is not to spread a task across multiple frames in a game loop coroutines fullfil that job quite elegantly,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVBPZW40OTItWTdvX3FYejhPNnZXSW5HaU5ZRW84OU1qZGJ3Qk5obzBueVFnSndRZE1jOF9GTEJSNGoweXhBeFcydTdzNk1FQzRDdzZqa1lCd21Da0E9PQ==

you realize that two out of those three steps are exactly what a rest api does right and the first step is the part of the iceberg that you happen to see above water the rest of the iceberg is someone having to write a crapton of resolvers to give you the open schema with all the nodes that you might possibly need heres the alternative im suggesting write your frontend to query for exactly the data it needs set up a dummy backend to give it that data so you can test it easily write a real backend api that gives exactly the needed data no graphql security concerns needed,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZc1NCRmY5Y05lakM2QkxqZENWY25JUEZHanRoLTZQMzlPQVR6SHZSWFpPZzBsQWMxaU8yZ1NCNzBHbEpBaHBkWEJJQmVSSnpQeTFhQjBXUjB6Zm1LUFE9PQ==

you have a point with such a big write size it shouldnt be such an issue i just checked and rust also uses kib by default when buffering so im surprised its so slow here it certainly can hit the ssd write limit just like python but thats at most one oom higher so its acceptable i guess tmp in memory has been the default on multiple of my machines so im a little surprised by that anyway cool quiz,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWHdLVk5ZWEs4d1gzT1hCMERrTjVlT3RSMDJ2Vy1NemRndm1vclR2dE5pQm9SZ19uZFdPX1VZSVdqZ2gybWkweHRrLXdTSGl0QTdBM202MFdZSU1wdUE9PQ==

rescheduling doesnt require a trip through the kernel blocking interactions are verboten or pushed to the very edge of the process where they belong you can implement exception and resume semantics without longjmpy nuttery etc i did up an async coroutinebased runtime for supercomputing a while back and we were able to beat throughput records with just a tcp networking layer obviously updated to infiniband but for a prototype it worked surprisingly well part of the fun is that you could work out onthefly where capacities were and how much load any operation would impose and either push data to wherever the metathread is or route the metathread to where the data is just need serdes info to be filled in and because functions were abstracted around the runtime could integrate gpus into it and flip between cpu and gpu execution as availability dictated it required conscious management of state but we were working towards something that could handle hardware threads being knocked out entirely which most threading runtimes treat as catastrophic and of course async coroutines is how threads actually work under the hood somebody has to implement threading runtimes either in user mode or kernel mode and until you set a bunch of stuff on top of the basic registerswapping mechanisms used by the kernel you dont get threading so you definitely need a layer on top of coroutines if implemented in c but beyond that theyre perfectly reasonable also multithreading is optional in c,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVzh2UnA0MVZHRGlycl9rOXhtZE00WDNlZlBDazVlcXowSnpxRTlBelpuVUJHSWJtdFk4RExnUjMzSGNrRmV3UzNWa2tNWUhsOFNiYnBNdXhUdzBhWEE9PQ==

why are you leaving introspection queries open to the public its trivial to disable and only sensible to do so and yes you are back at rest because you dont need dynamic querying after deployment and yes rest is simpler technically but graphql is simpler organizationally i very rarely talk with the backend teams the backend teams only talk with each other when they need a new entity type exposed caching is more complex because its moved to resolver level but it gives you uniquely identifiable objects in exchange which is a godsend for keeping client state in sync are you know what sometimes its desirable to have caching at entitylevel doing it with any rest architecture is challenging but i digress from a public pov rest and graphql are near identical if theyre not youre doing something wrong the whole sell is about development time and iteration speed,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX0tyTGlRY2lTd2hITlNSV2ljQ3VZYlRFWDBjOHpubkRGRjNrZXVzSm9XenJNM0gtSWZjYzI2X3V1VnhhaWJMcnp1TklsT3hMV3lmdkFFNV95ek5oaFE9PQ==
for a less longwinded reply if you dont see value in the tradeoff youre probably right for your case my case is <number> frontend teams working with a common api that is built by a dozen backend teams graphql absolutely makes sense as a tradeoff for us,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWDdqZGxJcjZXWGRDS2xpU0tHclFpbW5GMmdMMVpVODRZQW8tUWlkSmwxd1BIeDlQdmRzcDMxMGdBYVEzbXpMZktsNEEzd1B5a2hVVEJ4Ukt3UlFNVlE9PQ==

ok cool now you have just centralized the bottleneck to the one team that is responsible for the graphql server everybody else depends on them to add nodes write resolvers properly take care of auth caching etc now imagine instead of a graphql api this team was making a normal rest api what really changes nothing much a few queries have to be slightly redesigned organizationally everything else is the same,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWDNUNzJ2MVlDcjdRRjk5a3FFRnFPaU9CZTJFdk5vc0FmTGYyUkppY1dNeXV2RVdTUC1jeHVEdFpVMGNzNGxtTEN6M2NJZW9PLTVNS3RBYUpHb3QzMWc9PQ==

the ultimate destination for a graphql server is a service mesh each team owns a group of resolvers within their domain their interoperation is entirely schemabased nobody needs to write integration code or even talk to each to build integrated services so no the development of the graphql server is decentralized you can have <number> or <number> teams working on it in parallel airbnb is built on this idea impossible to tame all this distribution within rest absolutely not the same,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU0RPQS1xQ3R6RUxycmFQTkJaSjhKb0hiQlVWcjljQjg0NWRISFdhOWxBSTdubWV5TUVNTDRGaElEVnlKZFQ4RG1VV0I2ZnZNZHRFbkZrU3RQNk1FOUE9PQ==

i wonder why they decided to write everything from scratch in c++ instead of rust dont down vote me im serious im not trying to be a language snob but a browser is a tremendous amount of code and you can bet it will be riddled with security issues related to memory safety whether they are senior c++ veterans or not im not even worried about the founders im worried for people that contribute to these code bases who dont know everything about it im worried for the founders years down the road when they forget about some weird consideration that made sense at the time code reviews and unit tests dont catch as many bugs as people think they do and this code base is going to be complicated imo using rust for open source projects is awesome because the compiler will almost completely prevent any contributor from creating thread or memory safety issues regardless of their seniority the mutabilityborrowing system keeps code readable from toptobottom and prevents people from getting clever with holding onto references to things beyond their intended scope you can prevent things from being mutated without the infectious consts of c++ the potential for null reference exceptions ala options is obvious in code reviews when somebody uses unwrap error handling with discriminated unions is great compared to exceptions refactoring code in rust is such a breeze compared to other languages because of the mutability guarantees it has seamless interop with c if they still need to dip their toes into unmanaged code rust has a good standard library personal preference but i much prefer that rust has unit tests and documentation built into the language it has an enforced code style fewer ways of writing things and everybodys code looks the same it has great iterators for functional programming styles it has a package manager and i dont need somebody versed in the dark mysteries of cmake i dont have to periodically re evaluate includes to make sure i am getting the best compile times i could go on i just know that if i was starting this project today i would not be choosing c++,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ2l2cnVzekJGVkF0aEtDU2pncUwtVVZKQWw4bFBpY3NtZHp1ZjVOQnZwLU5xTGxNYzBvLU1DVlF6ck1MLWJHeWpwV29tRXNsTlR1N01CdlA3UmNTdVE9PQ==

to answer your question no decimal support wouldnt matter youre right that you shouldnt use floating point variables for money but most languages support integers and that is likely the most common solution you multiply all of the values by one hundred and store the numbers in cents or by one thousand and get another decimal place of accuracy some call the latter millicents though it seems inaccurate calculations might be performed with an additional decimal place for rounding an alternative is that some languages have specific number types or you use strings with a lot of fiddling instead in many cases youre using a special currency library that has specific math operations built in,r/programming,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNldYeHhldUxhclF4NThoMGRwTnRZWVVaRzByQXo5aUMwNXFCRGZLYUtFSU1sZE5wYzBvNjZwZjlCT1ljdTlxR2FOeUY1WVBxc0gzN2o4NVJGSEtVbFE9PQ==
