we dont know so do bio labs exist inside ukraine and is the us supporting them yes and yes ukraine does operate biological laboratories that receive us funding the us undersecretary of state victoria nuland affirmed those facts in a senate foreign relations committee hearing this week in which the republican senator marco rubio asked directly if ukraine had biological weapons nuland did not answer the question head on saddam def has wmds though and the russians blew up their own pipeline too  <url>,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTV0FUUWUwZXN4X1prWUY1X21nRXRfYWNGdGRHWVRTQjk5MUpaRm5wZUl1d2JROVRlRUhYRnRqNXhnTDhKSU1YRlVEMzZjTW9abHU0ekZSZ3JaWGdESlplTmNYck9keFlXeTg5UURteXZ1R3c9
i mean every single oecd nation has biolabs but that doesnt indicate anything nefarious or that they have biological weapons and ukraine has been one of the most surveilled nations over the last decade if ukraine had biological weapons it would have been developed with the united states or a comparable nation its hard to imagine that ukraine would be pursuing a biological weapon program considering the difficulties theyve been facing over the last decade,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUk1sUHU1Zl8xNHFKYlpDNllOeFZpeENHS2N2TEV1ckJvVTE0WERvREVUcVdxY0lIby03a2dGM2dReUdSR04yYjRjUW1qdERHWlFtc2IyREF6Y2hXOHc9PQ==

>the right thing for the wrong reason remains the right thing no no it indicates a wild goose chase democrats also hate biological weapons so if there were a situation where there was concern that democrats were uninterested in pursuing the existence of a biological weapon program in ukraine the ramifications of a dynamic like that would have significant spillover in militaristic and counterintelligence strategies that would be extremely harmful and reveal significant vulnerabilities its an example where contingent analysis can be applied to determine the likelihood of an actual concern about whether or not its a politically motivated inquiry,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOFVJRDBNV3FBOGtRZ09JdDRNaVMxQVp0amtTZWZGMHpyeWV6MFFmcVlnRnZQUFdrU09jNnRpRzdkZFY3VVE2VThFSk14UnJHM0lqcXlGT2NNWVhhMmc9PQ==

these arguments are ignorant first of all things like foreign aid and military aid are worth every penny every time on top of everything else it buys you a lot of influence secondly the us isnt giving money to ukraine the us government gives money to american weapons manufacturers so they give ukraine weapons its just corporate welfare ultimately what difference does it make to you if the us spends money to do covert ops in whichever country or uses it for ukraine its not money that you or any other citizen would have ever gotten its not like they decide to not fund ukraine and do something different with the money to benefit the people,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbmMyNmFFZ2pKUFNQY2J4ZzNZM1liX1JvYm5xMFB4aWdOYnF1UWRZT1lOeC02RzJlbDFrTmVuU2h2WFZ6VVRmbGI1UWdQZS1XMl9YNGpSbDN5a2JpdFE9PQ==
i personally dont think foreign aid is always worth it and it makes a big difference for one its adding billions to our national debt in a time where less and less countries are buying up our debt our economy is teetering on an edge right now sending billions to other countries seems like a terrible idea and why do you think its either spend billions on foreign militaries or do nothing with our money there are other things besides the military industrial complex that would benefit from financial aid,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZlM1cG5oQ2t5RkFYa0kxRUxfdUVvcXdjeXdiNmxObXRDSlV6cmdYclFscVh0VUg1NDE0NlNnSUc1WVRRSlJGYVN1U3JZVjRnTDhfeERDWHNuTDJaWFE9PQ==
> our economy is teetering on an edge right now sending billions to other countries seems like a terrible idea that is exactly the point the us isnt sending money to other countries passing a ukraine aid bill doesnt actually give them dollar bills its money that the government invests in the american economy were not giving them a check and telling them to buy whatever you want were forcing them to buy our stuff of course you could say we shouldnt invest so much into the militaryindustrial complex we need to invest more in education healthcare services or other sectors that benefit the average joe and thats a totally valid point but its not an economical argument > its adding billions to our national debt so what debt doesnt mean anything if the economy is growing at the same rate but on top of that the word debt doesnt mean anything to the us because the dollar is the global reserve currency if the us runs out of money they can just print more like theyve done many times already its also important to note that the biggest creditors of the us debt are domestic investors not foreign countries one sectors spending is another sectors income so if the us government doesnt take debt that means that the private sector is taking debt because it must all zero out if the government reduces their debt it means that the private sector has accumulated more debt in return,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRFJIZ253azBIdnc2UnBjR1owTEhlLXlkY1VJNk9fSm04TzRDeUVWcHpTaXBlOHNnaWVtVEdtSnJBTERzb2JBeDVtV3NCV2pZdVhzMHc3WjBaX1UyMkE9PQ==
thats pretty much all it does by way of the military industrial complex i do not see how in any way it benefits ukrainians at large ukraine has now placed the private firm blackrock in charge of its recovery fund meaning any monetary aid sent to ukraine is going straight to blackrock a us private firm unless the us becomes a wartime economy it cannot even come close to russin shell production and this war is being won with artillery so even if the aid is being recieved in a way that can be directly beneficial to the war effort which is already a big if then theres no way it could allow them to win anyway ukraines average age has risen massively its youth wiped our or left it is engaging in conscripting people by kidnapping them off the street and blocking the accounts of those who have left there is no way i can see how this money benefits ukraine unless you mean ukrainian elites its only really beneficial the us mic which is a big reason the us is doing it if youd asked me a few months ago if we should be sending military aid and if it was doing good i would have said yes probably but the facts on the ground have changed,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM1laSHpOM1A1dkJSMGNvMnZLeWQ1VXV2eVRoUDVheEdIVmd1SlVrdjZTaEFJZUx0REUxdjhzR2dGV2VoaExWbEdnV2dYVFJzd0t4Y25mcHJSaFowMGcxelNmX000Z3FtRnN4VHJFeGxZZFU9
> were not giving them a check and telling them to buy whatever you want were forcing them to buy our stuff however the exact same aid bill includes billions for israel and with israel we have a special deal where a percentage of the aid we send them is basically just a paycheck that theyre allowed to use to support their own military industry instead of our own > so if the us government doesnt take debt that means that the private sector is taking debt because it must all zero out i will say i dont know a lot about economics but this sounds like a system that will inevitably collapse one day will it not youre saying that someone needs to always be taking on debt,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdDEwU3VCNXN4S045ZjFqYUhjNXBYNXI5emJ5STZtNkJqb2F2SmxwMkItM2IybFozMTdMUXdDNUExa0JIRzBWay1iSHFIRkNxallBRTkwTGRia2w1Mnc9PQ==

> however the exact same aid bill includes billions for israel yes unfortunately thats a problem israel policy doesnt necessarily follow logic and reasoning mostly due to religious reasons > i will say i dont know a lot about economics but this sounds like a system that will inevitably collapse one day will it not youre saying that someone needs to always be taking on debt your interpretation of the economy is called austrian economics this ideology believes that the economy is like a household budget you have money inflow and money outflow and you need to make more money than you spend otherwise youll get into a debt spiral but most of todays economists dont believe this anymore according to them the entire economy is just made up everybody makes up money to represent the value of their country so its not like a household budget you dont need to earn more than you spend because except for money that flows outside of the country everything remains part of the system its a circular flow people provide labor to earn money they spend money to buy things from companies companies pay taxes and the government uses those taxes for things that the economy cannot create by itself like schools police military health care generally things that dont make or shouldnt make a profit at least in theory so the us dollar has value because it represents the united states people believe that the us economy will continue to grow and that their military will protect them from unforeseen events like wars creditors believe that the us will definitely pay back their debts to them in the future and thats why they lend them money and there is no reason to believe that this will change in the future of course they might be unforeseen events but you cant plan for those anyway obviously thats what all the politicians already know even the ones who constantly fearmonger about debt but theyre disingenuous if they were sincere they wouldnt hold any stakes in the us economy but all of them hold stocks and bonds generally its an argument that is always used to explain why its a bad thing to use government money to help the people,r/propaganda,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdHpZaHZYRTFDQkpHX2psUmRMbWpaaVFRcUZydWZoTDM1RXI0dlpxVWRWUjVMWjJ4SFFkbWVBbGFBend4aWQxRHR1bDd2RExkTFJKYURlQlFPaW5OSmc9PQ==
