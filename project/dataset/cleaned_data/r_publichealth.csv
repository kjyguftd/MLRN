to get a good study in this you would probably need either a massively multiplex pcr or ngs set up and a lot of people willing to be nasal swabbed every time they have symptoms if you got enough people to tell you their exact symptoms exact start of the symptoms known exposures you could probably slowly delineate a little better however i also hypothesize you would have a lot of viruses detected during allergies that we dont think have effects convoluting the results for context i have had moderate allergies since about middle school yet despite knowing myself fairly well i still miss the early symptoms of colds far more than i care to admit only realizing its a cold <number> or <number> days in and i get the thick phlegm starting or deeper chest symptoms conversely as a provider i used to see young military members who move to a new area and are convinced they are sick with something terrible because they have had a cold for <number> weeks but you put them on allergy meds and they are magically healed because they really had an allergy trigger or new allergy they didnt know about essentially even the suffering dont know what they have a lot of the time,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSDVXRktFNW9hMHlyMkxuYnZWTDlfWWgtNjFkZzVVS0VEUHd2U2xBYWkzMnhTR2RYT3RSQnBDTnlGcGo3RWxLaTBydU9vaVpqeFNCV0UxNnBkaExzQUE9PQ==

so grateful i came across your post i had no idea this creative type of format for resume was even acceptable and i completely and totally agree with you about putting the skills assuming you have some for said job post at the very top instead the very bottom and the education after the work experience with credentials listed with your name i think this is so absolutely genius and far better than the other common format its like the employer assumes you have the qualifying education in order to even apply for the job at hand and that education qualifier is like the exact same as hundreds of other applicants so why not immediately make yourself standout by putting your unique job experience first makes so much sense i love this way better my only apprehension is that it doesnt look or isnt perceived as or at all professional as the other hundreds of cookie cuttersame format style resumes ill conclude by repeating that i had no idea we could even do this ie switch up the formatorder of a resume have you ever received negative feedback about it specifically,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQWJXSTd6MThHTE5nNVFUZUdja1hlZFg4dnFLN3NfX2lpNF9STjBvMWpKV2Y3ZXNwQnE0Qk4zRG1VTXpCNEoxZWN0X0NyMm90a2s5V0NqbTN6YU1NV1E9PQ==

glad it helped i cant take total credit as im sure i picked it up from someone else along the way there are many different formats for resumes as you get more work experience your education becomes less important than your experience so it makes sense to lead with the most relevant info first remember you want to stand out in a positive way make it easy for the hiring manager to pick you personally i have never been told that this format is not professional ive had multiple colleagues adjust their format in line with mine while i havent gotten every job that ive applied to with it ive had a pretty good hit rate but as always good to check with your local career serviceslocal industry for their <number> cents good luck,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYR3I4bFZhOVd5OTlaQ0N6NHRXY2FET1VLcG1RUkllNndUT0hZY3ZYNkFTNkc1RzV2ZnhYUDRWZVZ3aGVwb1VfRWM5ajFrNG1DeEtuN1JOUlhuSHdRM1E9PQ==

thanks for the kind words sure wes is a service that assesses your international academic qualificationstranscripts essentially adjusts your gpa to make sure it aligns with the country you are applying to eg canadaus for better or worse a bit of a quality check adjustments of your gpa to make sure that you are on a level playing field with local applicants so unless you have any international education you wont need it for example in the uk at my school it was incredibly rare to receive a grade ><number> in fact a distinction was awarded with an average of <number> it was not uncommon for most of the class to have grades in the <number>s <number>s wes then evaluated my transcript assigned what those grades would have been in the uscanada on a gpa scale which were much higher s on paper than if i just converted a <number> to a gpa hope that helps,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRkllNUZFOEdHWDR4SGUyRXZvbEJfXzkwb1BId0pXU2U2OXJrTi1BSFZEeExHTnc3VG44YnVJbDhsM2h1aVJJSG1SYzBGQUh5SzVoV3RHWklEQk1fU2c9PQ==
yes <number> this i have a background in patient care would argue that it is incredibly valuable as a ph person to understand the frontline context daytoday challenges of frontline workers to then develop tailored solutions to those issues eg related to infection control data quality quality of care etc in my experience some in ph like to analyze clinical data report on it criticize clinicians for issues without understanding and trying to address other root causes of those problems im not saying clinicians arent part of the problem but it is often much more complex than just person a diddid not do x working in admin you will likely identify data quality issues clinicians generally receive training on their charting from a legal standpoint not from a how this could be used for population health why freetexting every cell in a chart is problematic for data analysis etc if youre engaged intellectually curious i am sure you will identify gaps that you could propose addressing and just by working in the healthcare space there will be more opportunities to network that might lead to something down the line if research is of interest suggest coapplying for grants with the surgeons to address some of the identified gaps good luck,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU09VRTZ5NUduZ2V3YUJMZTVaVVVOS0I0dG5MQmdQcE9EOElGVUhnUWNuN0V3NjB0TVhXTVFTMnRWUXZlN3BScFJlaDIyZVhlR25remhyeExFTFJja1E9PQ==

so i am in the consultant world working for state programsclients and not many public sector employees can keep up skills or pace wise for private sector thats not to say there arent any but in my experience multiple states now those usually already had an analyst background from somewhere else besides public health the data science folks at these locations usually dont understand the need for flexible analysis data sets andor dont understand the database or data sources themselves for example i have worked on projects that shouldnt take more than a week to get a minimal mockup using actual data for review or feedback i was given months so imagine the contrast between their in house teams and my work at our early project meetings as someone who gets dropped into environments and have to pick up data nuances and legacy processes quickly so when people in public sector say x amount of time of experience it really doesnt mean much unless you have productsend points to demonstrate your capabilities i will say that you should be more self motivated in learning new things or more specifically different ways to do things most health departments i have found need a lot of hand holding just to articulate what analytics products they actually want so your technical ability is nice but when someone says i want to know about this or understand that you should have or be working on a framework in your head thats at or near your capabilities and suitable for the given project,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN0hubnA0TWh5WkxZMXU1aFhEVkcwdThOSzJGaWxJWkNLbFRPekFDMk5SRWV1eEZRTDZuUkNLR0JjdFNJYzRQZXJ5eUdwejQ3VG5FWmpxdVhaSi01eGc9PQ==

basically someone or group wants to know some aspect of the data they have collected but dont really communicate specifically what theyre looking for so i have hopefully the technical skills needed they have the institutional knowledge with a better subject area expertise i should be close unless its completely a novel area for me in public health and we need to mix the two together to produce an end product that we are both happy with which can also go through approval in that sense i have to know what kind of questions to ask to move us to that end goal however i am drawing up a work process in my head as someone is describing it hope that helps,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbUVfWEMxaVFhNk9CZlRtZy1KcTZDdkc3WFVjaGUzdDVTdnJVOUdzZDJFcEoxQkx1NlN5WkpkR1VyWkNqeUpiSktKOS05bU1NYjIwTTV0VXB0dUpaa0E9PQ==

work experience is pretty big the mph is valuable for someone like me who got a biology degree and never touched epi or biostats in undergrad youre a little better off than that for teaching you almost certainly need a terminal degree to teach public health in any reputable program an mph alone wont cut it unless youre planning to go to medical or nursing school get a drph or edd maybe there are more options like mswdpt im not sure then you wont be teaching something to consider since none of those degrees are particularly cheap or easy to obtain drph and edd are attainable online but some are sketchy,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUEZPem40SFlodzlqXy0zR29ZUF9WZWpPYmpOVF90UnlpejU3WDlCcXFnLTh5VXhDbGtUenV1eHJ3cF9iYm1xU1kwU3VLbEpXcTZRUTQtX0F5Q0dIRVlIZHlFUy1NSzNfS0U4dE1HS2lHYTQ9

as it happens i work in the medical laboratory field ive worked as a phlebotomist lab assistant and as a tech for <number> years i just finished up my bsph a few years ago and am trying to figure out what im gonna be when i grow up l you could potentially try and get on with a state lab with just the micro degree but more often than not most labs want the medical lab science degreecertification someone else had suggested getting on as a lab assistant and seeing if you could get trained up depending on the area you live in this could be a good option but you wont make very good money to start just to be brutally honest and depending on where you live you might be required to get additional training or certification ie california new york and i think florida have certification requirements for phlebotomistslab assistants however the laboratory field is an older field there are a lot of techs that are reaching retirement age so there are a lot of facilities that are willing to train on the job or pay for tuition to get the degreecertification since you already have a bachelors in a science field you could probably do the mltmls cert program in a year and take the exam i know there are online programs like ucinn weber state and und that could be options as well if you can get a job at a local lab i recommend you look at the following websites to learn about mltmls certifications and trainings the ascp is the gold standard for certification but i have yet to work at a lab that didnt also accept the amt certification as well <url> <url> if you or anyone else have more questions im happy to answer them otherwise good luck,r/publichealth,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNF9MTXRvRU9IMHIxRFZSN2pZVDRLdFNYalMxUjlSZnl5czVUb1RBZFpVc2NzQTlvVllTczdjZWtmYkVnVUxHbGZmd2ZUaWpGazV0andRdWZDM2xiSlozVXV2ZGVKMG9mTWVrVTBHRlRnV0k9
