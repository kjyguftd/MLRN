in australian i would recommend honours over a masters i would also recommend applying to programs outside of australia uk europe and usa are ahead of australia in my view i did my undergrad and honours at uq for quantum computing their program is good by australian standards but not worldclass with the recent psiquantum news it may be worldclass in a couple years though also i disagree with the other commenters view on unsw it may be the best for certain areas of quantum technologies but certainly not for all wherever you go see what you like about quantum technologies and go to whatever university has people working in that area,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTNWtoY1dEUkxBNWhWR1ZGUTdUQWpqZlRJd2lwdjVyZ2FrbEU3aEk4d2QxY0hPc2pldFU3bU50cG1CT1hyb0ttZU9WdHlwQTRJNXk2Nl92MzYtdUNfZ1liSW1iSW1jRFFPOTNTNDNkRTJ5bUE9

ok a masters makes sense then alternatively if you have some quantum knowledge or can find a quantum project related to your cs background there is a lot of interest in ai at the moment for instance you may be able to skip straight to a phd i believe some australian universities also make you take classes as part of your phd now see sqa usyd and others probably so you could fill in any gaps in your knowledge along the way as for overseas studies you could apply for funding i think its worth a shot i did my masters and phd overseas and cant recommend it enough,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYnpRTkdkMjlFNTgtejFqRzFhVVV1VnlnZDdGTXhWdC1aWDFxUjYtVzU1VVlmNWE2QTRHcjM2cGZfbHhSTGhVLWxwQ0FBX2ZObm1zdk5xemVua0RySG9JR1FsRldGQlZIQXhyREVGc3FTLUU9

i did my masters at cambridge and my phd in the us i will keep the specific school private to remain anonymous us phds are funded so that was easy uk masters funding is a little more difficult for this there is external funding like ramsay postgraduate scholarships for instance they service countries beyond the uk too and also internal funding offered by your school it takes a bit of looking around to find funding opportunities but perhaps there is someone at your university that is up to date with this information and could help from my year at uq some people went to switzerland germany and japan too i think your wam would be competitive,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTWmNneDUtNk8yVGFYNURsdksydmMwdFNvYWtNNExjSE4zMldZM0hJWXJrdnAtZEM5Ml9kSHNoSGJHdU11Wll0N25ZVU9Qa1lBWWpka0lQUjNEVm1JSGdBS3JFVHVMaFVTS0ZzZjFnZzNvb289

also going back to potentially finding a quantum project with a cs background tyson jones comes to mind he has a cs background is australian and found a quantumcomputingfocused phd position that utilises his cs background also preskills group has a project on predicting properties of quantum systems using ai these are but two examples i have spoken to so many quantum groups looking for cs people,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTb2NlVmU2a2pIQ2NvVXRueUhwb3M2THpDVzBnaXlQb3dvRnpOUllZTGl2TndfZFpWRnpwVGpBdDZUSEpGNFE3X0JmUWxIWWthX21uOHdLNW1RUjQtczVtNVhyeVdYVnV1Tm8zbTZ0Y0w0Skk9
actually op my phd research involves a bunch of applied maths that is similar to that used in ai to help make better quantum waveform sensors my lab collaborates with my cosupervisor who is an applied mathematician who works in the engineering department on optimisation theory i doubt my lab or uni would accept a postgraduate student who doesnt already know basic quantum mechanics though eg the honoursmasters course assumes youve done undergrad quantum and that entirely defeats the purpose of you wanting to do a masters in the first place is this also true with the quantum tech masters at anu or uq its worth contacting someone there to find out preprint under review for anyone interested <url>,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZ0hCT2JrMGYyM3drb0Q1ZHZBaDl2R1F3YlM3OVVSekNDVlFYeFFZWGVqa3RmdWlkZjJQa1o3Yk0zbC0tT3Vic3FjQ0tkZ29WUjdiMmJHQm1KcGNiV2c9PQ==

most of the examples of a quantum advantage are purely theoretical for example some prominent examples of quantum advantage include grovers algorithm shors algorithm deutschjozsa algorithm and more these algorithms have been proposed mathematically but practically building a quantum computer to implement one of them is difficult there are some experimental examples that have claimed quantum advantage as well though much of this work is still controversial for instance ibm claims to have demonstrated quantum advantage<url> in their noisy quantum computers compared to a classical algorithm others have disputed this arguing that there might exist classical algorithms that can do this problem more effectively in addition there have been experimental examples of quantum advantage for solving problems that dont really matter in any practical sense researchers will concoct a problem for the purpose of demonstrating quantum advantage and then implement it on a quantum computer one of the first examples of this is work done by google demonstrating a quantum advantage using superconducting qubits this<url> blog writeup by scott aaronson provides a great explanation of this work that would be accessible to a nonexpert,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUTlMSi1uU2k1YXctRXNOZm5ndld0Qnl3Mk5vVjhVTnVZOExFYXNZTk1MeDh3R3lmNUN4d1R3VUhuZ21CblNoZmhuOUpNRFBGTVFlN3gtTU5MekladlkwbHlQQmNIQTRPckE2dmRPNjd3Rnc9

if you simply want to access a quantum computer remotely and dont care if your computation information is learned by someone else such as an untrusted server then a quantum cloud computation service is enough eg provided by ibm quantum platform blind quantum computation is a kind of secure delegated quantum computation that allows you to access a remote quantum computer securely more specifically blind quantum computation allows you to delegate your quantum computation task to an untrusted quantum server meanwhile the server can learn nothing about your computation except the size of your computation here a quantum server means has a server who provides quantum computing as a service in some sense you can also think blind quantum computation is one of quantum versions of full homomorphic encryption,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTc1JBS0VlSUh0SDZyY3k0NWdpcjh2Q0hXWDl4dVJEMllCLWZBM1JCYVlxTUhYUGFLWWdmMndNOThWV3AweEpBd3FSaEVVSk9PSnpzX1BzYWlPUEJsOFE9PQ==

a good drinking game for anyone interested is to look up the latest articles on quantum breakthroughs and see how many use the phrase highly scalable in every situation ive seen this used including in this article it has barely been demonstrated in a tinyscale form and there is no evidence on how they would scale this is significant because there is no way that quantum computers could be usable if these schemes cant be scaled this study in this article demonstrated a process with a onequbit system and concluded that it could be scaled arbitrarily i dont think we need to dig back into our physics textbooks to say that whilst that is great marketing its terrible science the article makes this point for me they say that approaches researchers currently use to connect to quantum computers for example ibm and amazon web services aws are not scalable however they would also have us believe that the unproven system that the scientists are proposing would be scalable the usefulness of the proposal hinges on the idea that it is not acceptable for the company hosting the quantum computer eg ibm or aws to be able to snoop on the quantum algorithms being run however people accept this with cloud computing and remote access to supercomputers which are used widely in almost every industry to store proprietary information and this is not viewed as a problem there to round it off in classic fashion the article states quantum computers are poised to outperform the worlds most powerful supercomputers this unproven statement might be a good one to add to your <number> quantum computing bullshit bingo card your boy schrodingers rat,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTTW5mLWhtVktVVHRmQnZyQXVBdDAxeHdGYXJSQjdJQ2ZvTGlaRXJRMEE2eGU1dmgwWTl0eklmZ203UW1pZEFaMTRxZy1tbVNpZVRCR2J1RUdaT0NtQXlTckhUektyNFF2NS12c2t5aERYSzA9

what problem are you actually trying to solve your question is confusing its like asking for an academic paper comparing the lubrication performance of motor oil versus ice cream published research on such a question is going to be scarce because its not a question that comes up in practical situations current quantum computers are a long way from being able to run even a small support vector machine even in a fictional future world where the hardware constraints disappear its deeply unclear that svms would be a useful quantum algorithm because theyre specifically designed to help classical computers deal with classification problems theres almost certainly a better quantum algorithm again assuming away hardware constraints to solve the same problem set on current quantum simulators running nontrivial svms would probably take millions of times longer than just running its classical version because theyre doing a bunch of work to take a classical algorithm into quantum land and back again quantum computers arent magical accelerators to classical workloads they work very differently as far as current science tells us there is no useful comparison between running the same algorithm on both classical and quantum they require different algorithms,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTcFEyMFNGNXlhYjBuQ05kaFJjNzZMY2lzc1JRN0luSVM2TDZPLTAxSnRUemtWZUNLcjdjTkN0V0ZGVjlCNEhCVGNrc0tmUXNDRVo0SEJaYWNnOTF4Mnc9PQ==

hello everyone im searching for a project that i can build out in qiskit this summer to further my understanding of quantum computing im an undergrad in cs and recently took a quantum computing class aimed at computer scientists it covered the basics of quantum systems as well as a few important algorithms deutsch josza grovers shors ending with basic fault tolerance and error correction the two main projects for the class were a grovers algorithm implementation and a library that performed error correction and fault tolerant gates using the steane encoding i plan to take a further course in error correction but i havent found any good projects in that sector the ideas dont need to be strictly error correction though my current idea is finding the ground state energy of a molecule and i think working with pulses could also be very interesting so any help is welcome thanks for the pointers,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSmJBM1JaX056aWNOOUtqZVhEZTZiV1lONmJ6TWF6NXRJNEZmaEVCUUtpemNoelByV25Sd0dmM2F5OFo3cE50Skp5dFNhdnBHdGJXMzBMYjUyeWktZlE9PQ==

i think its different we already can have high level abstractions and an actually a lot of qc programming is done in high level languages like python but to understand what is happening i do think the circuit representation is better you can have different gates on different qbits and with entanglement it can be a mess to keep in mind whats going on by just looking at sequential code and as an added point the circuit representation is actually hardware agnostic it does not care if your computer is photonbased or is made of coldatoms every type of qc implements gates differently and some only approximate quantum universality the ability to implant any unitary operations i do also think that when qc will be mature since they are useful for only a handful of problems we will just refer to what algorithm the computer is running like we just call groversalgorithmx and forget whats underneath,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVeENYbjBfSnd4ZGF2WEdOaWR0bTNOeHRoYm5FTTdnRW1nSEl5Snh5dkpGakpMdlp1Yl9zcWw1VDJzdGZ4OV8xeGRyaFB5RjhWSHFpa2VkOWJ5aElsRnc9PQ==

so first the quantum computing unit of information called a qubit is not multiple states existing simultaneously what is happening is more nuanced than that but i wont get into it next the butterfly effect is a different phenomenon more related to chaos theory that is if you have a dynamical system it could be extremely sensitive to initial conditions as well as impossible to numerically predict its future state these things are related your last question is interesting though because an advantage of a quantum machine is that it would be able to naturally simulate a quantum mechanical system in fact you can simulate a quantum system classically its just that it becomes intractable pretty quickly and so the whole simulation could require absurd amounts of memory or time a quantum machine would be able to simulate a quantum mechanical system without such a huge overhead as you would see in a classical system,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWOUxFODVRVkVwaVoySzNLV2pkQ1dpZXlZdkI4Z1I2Z1JUOV9xbEFSbWRBSGluWjZZMVJrRDQ0eml6c2FnZ2ZuZVozblRpZ1F6VW9ER2hYelN4SkRGZzVJY0FpaWNkcjJ5VlpiTmpKMk5obmM9

using the roughest estimates possible as a teaching tool it is hard to use classical computers to simulate quantum matter because every time you add an electron proton photon etc the amount of memory you need to store all the data doubles eg simulating <number> electrons needs about <number> numbers to be kept in your computers memory using a quantum computer the hardware components are also quantum so it is kind of like the available memory doubles every time you add a qubit to your processor eg <number> electrons can be simulated with <number> qubits of memory which hide the <number> classical computer numbers to simulate the entire universe you would still need a computer the size of the universe even worse when you try to read the state of your memory you can only learn a tiny fraction of the data at a time so you would need to run the simulation many times,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWSDY3YnBOYWZyQjZmbG14Zm85M0FlWlQtVVNfN1R0ZTBscHNtQzc5ZEp2THExN3FWS05CMDFnVVZFU2pfWUZMb1V5RVJjcjg3dm5zQWQ3eEZ3Mkh1UVE9PQ==

nice i only knew comp sci before getting into quantum and i soon realized with no formal physics or quantum mechanics background i can do fun projects and map classical to quantum theories and get a decent grasp of qc but actual career prospects are limited without knowing the fundamental physics besides im out of hs and college now so not much i can do in taking physics and quantum mech classes but if you do wanna bolster your qc resume thats gonna help most qc professionals researchers since research is where virtually all qc jobs are at the moment come from physics or mech e backgrounds and yeah knowing linear algebra probability and comp sci is a good starting point but having physics is great,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbzVBcUVsU2pkRzdTY1NjUk1IbzNiYzU5WklMSHVXMzQwenVYYTBiVlBYOWRvbDc5aEJhV2JGSzN0ZE1hUkUta3ZsNnJOWENLaWlVOWlQOU5CQXFSM3c9PQ==

given your background in cs one path would be to position yourself on the programming side you could consider doing a masters or phd in computer science with an emphasis on quantum information science some schools will offer a quantum informationquantum technology certificate along with a cs masters degree id probably recommend this over starting over in physics as it will be a more more straightforward path for you and there are still plenty of jobs that require that skill set you could also consider starting with some non academic certifications to get a feel for the field its a bit hard to give advice right now because things are changing quickly the field is getting more competitive but also teams are getting bigger and do hire some people without phd i know <number> person who broke in with a masters and another with a ba only though of course neither of these positions is high level or anything it might be helpful to look at companies national labs with quantum computing efforts and see what qualifications they are asking for on the cs side,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdVVRYUhRc050VlFLc2o0ZWo3WXkyM3FlZkZaRC1WRTc0VFgxOGh6bExBTDlYSXpGM2txZnlwQVZMMjl6dzRxWmVoWjlUWmRBWmNYRzYzTE9IUUJwQVE9PQ==

i need an advice i am studying electronics engineering bachelor right now and i love studying normal computers algorithms physics and deviceselectronics photonics etc so i thought why wouldnt i do my phd in quantum algorithms as it is the one that gathers all of that now i should choose a field because of some circumstances and opportunities my question is is quantum algorithms a promising field and if not would it be a good choice to choose quantum hardware,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldnRvcHVlWWhySVNuUjh5MEUwVlFXam5fazZ2clFsZ3NySDVmYnV5Mm1SQnc1bjVfY1hDNnNiR1NBYW9xLUl0aHB4S25GOEpadTU2VGNBQ2xrWFVhakRXT3g3N2x5WVEzZ2N0Q3ZJQkF6SWM9
truth is we have very little idea if quantum computers would be useful for ai there are some primitive quantum algorithms for machine learning but none of them would be competitive with atscale classical computers running stateoftheart machine learning architectures contrast this with other things like factoring or grovers algorithm where we know for sure as soon as we get a large enough quantum computer they are going to have a huge advantage people will naturally want to hype something like this because it is two exciting buzz words put together ai plus quantum computing that must be something but it really isnt yet maybe not ever,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlV1NNUHpqZXhWRkpXZHhuWjU3Z3JJSEZPUm9Sb1RnMVBvdkpoNXk3UnhqMHZTNEVBMTNib2xMYk5CaFV3ZDB2RDlIR3ZjSnVZYmRrZ1kycXA3QmZiVEE9PQ==

its good at approximating and or performing large scale linear transformations and or calculations and those tend to be very heavy computationally and in that sense quantum computing is better but this all requires large scale working quantum computers and calculations or rather large matrices normal computers now are better and may be for a few years that being said if ai is more refined ai could again find a cool way to speed up matrix calculations improving them quantum computing is not necessarily in its infancy but due to its different logic its hard to get dep into how it will benefit humanity much less robots without an expert its also good at encryption,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlN3NmUzlnU0FxdTZhTzFhWkZaVEhvSWVJdDBHRmFLdTBDeGUwUUtEUmpmamV1c0pxbzQ0R09ic0hISEgtaWNoNDJ3MTFsa2ZsRkZTODdZdUlTeVhFZ2FzMWpWOWhvR29SSHRYRjhtUVdVc3c9

if i had to guess this wont happen for a long time if qubits are like nodes in a neural network then youll need millions of qubits for rudimentary algorithms with all the error correction i also dont see why we would do this when classical computers do it so well already just too many unknowns to expect it to be so soon in the future,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVnpXMUtKWUZVMm1nVFhpemNVYjMyYWdRN0J2eW1TaUU0SGdIZ3JBVFJhLUd0RFc3Y1J0NE02dWh5UGhWMURmdXY4N3BNOGt4dV9qbVVUX2lKSmZwZXc9PQ==
i might have a more pessimistic view of things coming from a background in complexity theory but the universe doesnt owe us efficient quantum algorithms to solve things there is a lot we dont know about the effectiveness of quantum computers but it is pretty clear that they arent good at everything in fact its more like they seem to only be good at some very specific things and so far the evidence is leaning toward it not really being ai in my opinion there are only like <number> algorithms that we know to a high degree of certainty are faster on quantum computers than classical computers right now everything else is just hype,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmV3RaZUppU2NJMWtrMW5uYkJkUHM5TTdRM2t5TUtLTUk4U0w4RFU5bVJRWDN6Y2t0OV9oYlF2eTVpZ0toX1VSbGxBeVM0LTk4V1R2R0tJeWFDMTBKWUE9PQ==

you are not missing sth e^iat is one of the caveats of many quantum algorithms that is not emphasized enough you can either use block encoding a in that case you can directly map matrix elements to quantum gates or you can write matrix as a sum of orthogonal matrices which can be mapped into quantum gates or you can use trottersuzuki to get exponentiation by using terms in the summation a=sumi hi for the resulting circuit complexity there are many more methods and suggestions but i do not think the overall complexity can go down from omegan^<number> because if you have matrix with n^<number> independent elements then you have to have n^<number> independent gates to represent that matrix of course when you are working with quantum data or using data sampling methods it is different,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtc19lWXlSVElxRjZzajRrX2dVa2RaMmRwR0VCRWFTZGx6TG1RU0drZDN2NTRxMHhfblBJd2JhVzNzZ2NVOFZ0dUhqMkQxM3RpSm53dmo0T2ZhN2NDRFE9PQ==

its definitely possible to do this type of pivot i used to study swe within cs before pivoting to more theoretical cs and then subsequently qc but it is certainly a pivot depending on your interests theres lots of traditional swe work that is needed to support companies doing quantum research take for example qiskit its a python library and its written by a teamcommunity of primarily software engineers knowing quantum stuff helps but ultimately the knowing how to make good software is just as important that being said that type of work isnt really the same as quantum algorithms quantum algorithms is a lot more indepth and youd likely have to spend a bit more time getting familiar with both theoretical computer science and quantum computing as a whole if you havent studied some of the famous existing quantum algorithms eg grovers shors any of the early supremacy algos such as deutschjozsa id start there its quite different from how you have to think about classical algorithms since quantum information brings about a whole new set of restrictions no cloning measurement alters state need to take advantage of interference to see a speedup,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuY3Y5dks2SzNqdDJab0FSRGVSdnZvR0xvT3JmZDYtNGxJcWxBQllOSUk4UFg1Q2ZVV0RKZGpzbjdWanl5aThWV185X0xGVnBsVWVxcGplUmNsVlJIRTJBRFZ0Y1BBb21QZ2FIc1g4VEZoTEU9

the wording suggests that you find more authentic value in your art if you truly took the time to understand what an algorithm is before trying to randomly refer to some simply because of the word quantum thats not gatekeeping but pushing you to be true and honest in your work its truly meaningless to randomly refer to qaoa or shors and have a vague connection to pixels or paint or dance moves having said that if you google search google quantum team artwork you will see exactly who you should talk to the team have been expressive in embracing art as a cultural element of their work and you should reach out to them directly,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNWtiSWpnVzMzcjYtWHZRQy1wTlRvN1FVWmdBVVBEb2Z4WjJjdGExTEhSSzVtSGNwSkk2MGkzWW54cHM2My1CaFBKa2VXSVpDR1o4dlVOYTlSSUtzWWc9PQ==

hi everyone im studying eletronic engineering in my first semester but ive already have experience in a lot of the math and physics in the basic course because ive done a lot of olympiads in high school besides other university i have joined but left it after some time im saying this only because im really interested in this research area about quantum computing but im not sure where i should start not even sure if as an eletronic engineer i could work in this area so im thinking of change my course to computer eng i already have grades for this but i need some advices so if you were a student in some university and wanted to explore this area of quantum computing which course would you do and where would you start knowing the fact that you already know the basics of quantum mechanis since now thanks for the answers d,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvX1hNbl9jV0xJWFdRNGhFd3pkQzg4UnMzQ1A5UWZtQWR2eHBiSzVtNVJoa0dQNU9kWno5N0hSMW0tOGRyX3RGMjBzSXI2a3RVX0xZVFYxQjBmSzI1cGc9PQ==
admittance of my lack of knowledge is not a suggestion of my dismissal or laziness towards the subject i am a physicist as well as an artist and i understand if you think im using quantum as a pop science term to leverage my art i have worked with quantum computers in terms of hardware and am expanding to more computational aspects of quantum computing my post itself was made to speak to others who could provide their own genuine passions for the field so that my project can highlight both the human and scientific aspects of being involved in a field where the advantage is yet to be fully realized theres a reason why many collectives are creating artist in residence programs and trying to onboard creatives to work with quantum computing its to reconcile the perceived gap between science and art and why my project began perhaps the lack of concrete information due to privacy with my org is what made this suggestion to you but i hope my message reads as a push for you to be true and honest about how you perceive newcomers to the field regardless of their background or identity,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdDU5RjRnVkc0ZWRmVVZjUmJXejdNZkc2cmJzenFjVk4wWmxNcmNxdTJWQzAyZXVKd2hXWGVjN1oxVHVlY1BJWllwaUpJazFWLXZidGczUjU4UVFtTHc9PQ==

the problem is that classical algorithms for machine learning are already very very efficient they are either linear in the input parameters which is optimal and cannot be improved by quantum algorithms or quadratic at worst which might be improved but i dont see how it would be significant enough to justify all the fragility and expensive of a quantum computer over throwing absolutely massive amounts of cheap gpus at the problem quantum computers even when they are at usable scale will only be cost efficient for solving problems where the qc has a significant speed up over classical computers shors algorithm being the clearest example of this,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvM1lGZEp6ZkcxQ3F6TmxuWEVndlU1SElYUldkSGFhM05aWVhUM1dqTld4WVBqYTk4c2V4Y3pSZnkxZnk0V3I2MWp6YUNJY0JyV29UVlh2SUUtR25JR0E9PQ==

vqe suffers from a huge a number of theoretical issues see barren plateaux and there is a growing consensus that it will not be useful as a nisq application photonic quantum computers are certainly not cheaper by default it is difficult to get individual photons to interact with each other the level required for information processing cooling is not necessarily the hard part about building quantum chips and while may present a challenge long term for scaling up has mostly been solved in the short term photonic chips will still required a great deal of cooling as certain highly precise components require a great deal of cooling i know this doesnt answer your question but i hope ive provided some perspective,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RnA2SXlMYWx1bGJKN2VLa0djUVBJS1RlV0hOT0lRRkhKNHo3V1ZESXRlMHhNNXFBTFJRdXhaRU1NQ1Q2WDk1N3htTEhEQ1JGZXh0WktlM0thRm1UQVE9PQ==

sure you can operate waveguides fibers and beam splitters at room temperature you can even fabricate on chip gates even nonlocal <number> qubit gates can be done theres good recent work out of prof chee wei wongs group andrew wieners group and maria spiropulus group about some of this stuff done experimentally theres also good work from a lot of chinese groups like jianwei pans group at ustc christine silberhorns group also has a lot of good photonics people but the issue arises when you want to do measurement you at least need ln temperatures for stuff involving apds which have way too many dark counts for people to enjoy and k temperatures for most low jitter low dark counts high quantum efficiency snspds but then for some nonlinear waveguides like batio there are may be some unfun phase changes at lower temperatures lithium niobate is all the rage right now but its not compatible with foundry processes you have to build a dirty fab or a fab facility dedicated to doing lithium+semiconductor processing as li is a very very reactive element li battery fires used to be a concern for single photon sources that arent stuff like attenuating a laser into ppln or ppktp waveguides and the like they need to be operated at cryo temps and integrating them onto a photonic chip also has its challenges for example lots of quantum dots love to have photonic crystal cavities for purcell enhancement then you would need a photonic crystal waveguide to collect the light somehow etc also what basis there are a lot of basis you can pick for photonic qc each have their own advantages and disadvantages also on chip photonics can be hard to adjust the gatecircuit level stuff depending on the basis you pick like its not really trivial how to spacially shift optical components on a silicon chip anyways this is probably overkill on detail but everything has its issues right now photonic qcs can get real expensive real fast tape outs are expensive on chip optics arent trivial to make sorption fridges and snspds cost a lot dont get me started on the cost of really high quality lasers sometimes you want some erbium doped fiber amps etc compare it to superconducting stuff like dolan bridge or manhattan process to make jj isnt trivial but i would say this is easier than the much larger scale integration and careful fabrication needed for some photonics chips but what i will say about photons is that no matter what platform you use for computation you always will need to rely on the photon for communication,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UHN2MEh1ZmRkMG5ZeVhmTW5uSlRlaXEzRm9wWWFJc21yanNXdXEyekhtZEEwSjJtR3BUQ3hySHhPMjU2ZFo4N1dYR3ViVTRtN1JxeFBXMC1wVHE4WFE9PQ==

yes is the easy answer it depends is closer to a useful answer i work on a team doing something like this and we were assembled specifically based on our skill sets and prior project exposure weve got an even mix but various depth of expertise of physics and computer science on one axis and research to commercial on the other this is increasingly becoming the norm as the quantum utility era drives the funding that drives the research intentions that drive the papers published every member of the team is expecting to have a conversational understanding of every other though which isnt hard in this day and age an ai researcher joining the team wont be sitting writing ket notation by hand but should spend a weekend or two doing some coursera or edx to understand what thats all about which imho is the best bit of these teams and these opportunities getting to learn outside of a sphere of expertise hopefully thats a useful insight into one team example although this applies to a few different roles in this domain ive had,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eDlubjZWYnVGYm5NSklTZWJLWEkyYlpNblJMT01tTEFzSFY0dGtwS2RZOHotR3VMSGJtZkRHeFQzVFdOeXZiSjVqTWVxMS1XaEdlaGlvNUJUeTFqY1E9PQ==

the idea is that superposition the ability of a quantum object to be in multiple states at once allows us to explore multiple different solutions to a problem at once quantum computers have the unique property of exponential state space growth with the addition of more qubits and when we entangle more than one qubit to another we can better manipulate that <number>^n search space where n is the number of qubits algorithms like shors algorithm combine a few of these techniques to effectively search for a solution in a wide range of possibilities simultaneously in a way that a classical computer could never do if you have time you should look up that algorithm and try to understand how it works many different possible answers to a sub problem are put into a superposition and a qft quantum fourier transform is used to find the most frequent solutions in that search space in parallel classical computers would take millennia to factor the numbers we believe shors algorithm can do,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4bDV3M3RJU1d6RE01dDljbXdDcFMzWHRoenJvQ2l5TTV6MHpHZ3dDaFNROGR0REwwNzZ4dGlXcjFkclFLQTRKc1RFYll4RTVtMmp1djQ5SFdFWnUzS3BkZXJhejFXbUxuNE9RZnNBcTNSSDQ9

the idea of parallelism in quantum computing is generally widely misused and misunderstood not helped by press releases pop science and lots of oversimplification it is usually well intentioned but is prolific enough that lots of conversations to people outside of the field start with explaining why quantum computing is not just trying every possible solution at the same time what they often mean is something like i have a function a unitary operation that can operate on quantum states eg send |x>|<number>> to |x> |fx> this also works in superposition eg send |x>|<number>> + |y>|<number>> to |x> |fx> + |y> |fy> with a single application of my function wow my operation is operating in parallel these superposition states are easy to build consider the hadamard gate can be used as h|<number>> = <number>sqrt<number> |<number>> + |<number>> this creates a uniform superposition over the binary strings of length <number> <number> and <number> if i used a hadamard gate on every single one of my originally |<number>> n states i can create a uniform superposition over all binary strings of length n then just apply my function and ive explored every possible value of my function in parallel wow an incredible speed up it would have taken me <number>^n applications of my function to do this classically except i havent really the crucial concept thats missed is how i get information out of my quantum state when i measure my state i collapse my superposition and project the quantum state accordingly in the case of the above id get to read out x and fx as values but just for one value of x as my state was in a uniform superposition the x i get here is a completely random binary string in fact it is well known and proven that for a single measurement of my quantum state i can only get at most n bits of information out of my n bit state the quantum state contains vastly more information than that but were limited by our ability to read it to get more information out i need to repeat my entire algorithm again and measure in the example above i now have to start hoping i dont read out things ive already measured the way ive set up this problem it would currently be better to run it on a classical computer the difficulty in quantum computing is that were working with probabilities and to get useful information out eg which x minimises fx youre going to need to find a way to maximise the probability of reading out that specific x broadly there are three parts of a quantum algorithm initial state preparation state evolution and measurement to get theoretical advantage you need to consider all of these parts and ensure that none of them are going to cost you the advantage in the parallel explanations nearly all of them neglect measurement there are some problems where weve managed to create theoretical advantage usually by exploiting some kind of structure or pattern in the problem itself eg shors algorithm hhl quantum amplitude estimation quantum signal processing but these are not without their own problems hhl for example solves ax=b faster than classical but all advantage is lost in having to measure and readout the solution the standard resource to recommend for qc is nielsen and chuangs quantum computation and quantum information which is a fantastic textbook requiring some mathematics background if you want something with less mathematics then thomas wongs introduction to classical and quantum computing is another excellent resource,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4UjRyX1o1R3EyZHBxa3FCUDBFYnBtRzZ0RU5VR1Y0NjRIakpOVGhURXg1ZC16dUJZSlpnMHd3cHNoYU9zbUNKN2FNUTlzc3NLRkdraEFNcVdTNWszZXc9PQ==

the exciting part of a new computing paradigm is that we dont yet know what it can do classical computing has been around long enough that weve figured out very useful ways to harness its power which has changed the world now that quantum computing is on its way we have to figure out what kind of things we can do with it we know its great at optimization and simulating nature so we can optimize supply chains and simulate drugs or new materials but we have barely even scratched the surface of what is possible the race now is to find algorithms that are practical and possible to run on nearterm devices the problem today isnt how many qubits you can have we could make a chip with a million qubits tomorrow with the semiconductor tech we already have but its error correction just like classical computing went from using faulty vacuum tubes to the fault tolerant transistors quantum computing needs to have fault tolerant architecture its own transistor moment once you can trust that there will be negligible error the sky becomes the limit if i were you i would totally be hyped its like we discovered an alien cube and are just trying to figure out what its useful for the answer could be literally anything as of now though its going to be research and deep tech companies racing to find fault tolerant architecture i would say that a bonafide chatgpt moment is probably a decade ahead though but its best to get in now and ride the wave up but i know that people rarely have the patience for something that takes that long i think the saying goes people overestimate in the short term and underestimate in the long term,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1M1NQRUlaRWhUb05EYnRVV1ZsYnU0ZnBHSzB4NHdmR1BrVjFUTkZIWDdOc0UtMFk5dE5pVFB0cEhfSUhBSnFpS1F2TDMyMEF1VHo4aXJIeFh5NmFMajNEak9XSDJjWEpuOGJWbEJzLUdaVUE9

no they are completely different technologies ibm is working on what is usually meant by quantum computers together with a lot of other companies and universities and whatnot that is indeed with applying gates to qubits it can give you exact answers depending on the algorithm btw but that is not entirely relevant quantum annealing relies on mapping a problem to a hamiltonian sorry for the jargon think of it as an energy landscape in which a ball can roll around and find a minimum and changing that hamiltonian so that the minimum you find corresponds to the answer you are looking for i am not sure they might be equivalent in some computational sense which problems they can solve they also might not be i dont know if that question has been answered but the difference is not between error correction or which can give exact answers,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ZUpZZERfWVdFTzhKM0NLYXByN1dkOWpqQWs0ZS11Wm5ITkdjenlDQ3gxczE1OFU3NXQ4WnJzWU5pTTBnVEVGM2hjblZ5TVpFWEVNSHllbjJrVl80X2thZGI2YUNRRWFEWnpOYUtPT0U5WGM9

the hardware and more specifically for noise the superconducting hardware the winner of this early era of hardware in my opinion is going to be those using the universal elements themselves trapped ions and neutral atoms ionq quantinuum quera there is significantly less overhead in their systems than a superconducting system both in terms of error correction needs and the actual physical manufacturing and footprint of the system im all in on ionq as an investment i think their alltoall connectivity of the ion chain their high coherence times low error rates and product roadmap puts them in a strong position to win lots of contracts over the next few years as quantum hardware with high fidelity grows in demand then my hope is there is a synergistic effect more available hardware makes more applications and uses of the hardware increasing demand for their hardware and a feedback loop of application + algorithm development on increasing hardware demands and were in the early stages,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2b0JuRUNRR3o2MWhXak5PQm9OR21GaElseC1VcS00UFVQWTV5a1FibmdJUURSZHVEajBYN3ZPRDBuTTlVVmhxYmZSeXV5Q29mOUl6UHpSSG9SZ1ljM2c9PQ==

first and i say this with kindness please use paragraphs the impact of what you are writing is far less given most people will skip such a wall of text as someone who works in the industry building these systems i have to pull you up on the claims that its only noise holding us back from having largescale qubit systems thats not true a big issue right now is the connectivity of the qubits the nature of the control systems attempting to do interconnects and the difficulty in maintaining optimised settings in the generation of the starting state the operations and especially the measurements as things scale up we have to keep solving these problems in new and challenging ways ive been talking with a chip designing in the classical space who showed me how they are essentially gluing stacks of transistors on top of each other to get around previously impossible to solve limits in quantum tunnelling effects and its so inspiring to see such cleverness being possible but for us on quantum systems its extremely hard at every level of the stack and noise is just one of many many problems to solve over time and were not even sure how effective these theoretical algorithmic advantages really prove to be just this month were seeing debates between specific vendors about whether certain algos work better on their system or the others its important to understand these realworld performances be excited but be informed and be patient its going to be a long time yet and were doing the best we can,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2dDNYejlyVE53TzRGRE05ZEc4bXp3TWJ0Q251VjNTOTY2Ukd2ckxib0VSQ21YQkt6b0NGMFNvblhYSGFJNGMxVEtjWmgzRlVidXp2WmM2R0syQVFDTVE9PQ==

so actually just knowing the qubits are entangled is not enough for that first statement to be true there are lots of ways for qubits to be entangled in general if measuring one can tell you any information about the other they are entangled but that will not exhibit this exact property the type of entanglement that satisfies what youve described here sounds like the bell state<url> phi+ for your nd question since the x and y basis are orthogonal you will get a completely random result for the nd qubit assuming the bell pair <number>sqrt<number>|<number>> + |<number>> measuring the st qubit in the x basis will collapse the state actually the idea of collapse depends on your interpretation but either way the math works out such that measuring the nd qubit in the y basis will project to |i+> or |i> with equal probability to see this observe that <number>sqrt<number>|<number>> + |<number>> = <number>sqrt<number>|++> + |> proving the prior is left as an exercise if we measure the first qubit in the x basis we get either |+> or |> as an outcome that leaves the remaining qubit in exactly the same state as the first either |+> or |> depending on measurement outcome but since |i+> and |i> have the property that |<i+|+>|^<number> = |<i|+>|^<number> = <number><number> and similar for the ket |> you are left with random noise see the wikipedia article on the born rule<url> for more info about how to compute these probabilities based on quantum state,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2N1I3LXJlYzFxbWVtd3VjT1hKMDZBUzhsdkx5Mm9EY3Vma0o5V3ZhZnA1TDQtX1lIZ0hBQnU3NU9OVnlJVnNqZlg1ZER5em9nVEN0S2Y0ckZESlVWTURMSHd6UmowcTY1Rnp0bWxZTmh3Wkk9

yes there is a metric where we could call this efficient its polynomial in the dimension we are taking a <number>^n dimensional operator and reducing it to <number> and <number> dimensional operators which requires an exponential number of gates but thats because we are stating this problem in terms of number of qubits if instead we stated this in terms of dimension d we would say that decomposition requires od gates ie its linear in the dimension its a technicality but i think its important to realize that the input of this hypothetical algorithm is exponential in size and arbitrary eg perhaps stated as a <number>^n x <number>^n matrix and as per usual if our input is exponential in some variable most likely the running time or memory complexity will be at least that as well moreover if our operator is exponential in dimension but is expressed say as a product of smaller operators decomposition can be done linear in the length of operator product which is logarithmic in the dimension thats also much more efficient,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3dmMxUEJHT0hGTTlTcXppSEt6X1VZVTc0N0M1R0FDV3ljYTFsWE5YQVNFc3h1V0FOelFIc2duNlZHNUFTVlBrVVdtZVNfN0JWZVcxbjV4OWJoTHN2dWc9PQ==

one thing i can say is that if you try to design a quantum circuit with some unitaries that apply to <number> or more qubits such as kfold multi controlled rotations they are never implemented at once on real hardware and neither they are in quantum simulation environment like qiskit etc actually maybe with the exception of the ccx toffoli they are always decomposed into an exponential number of su<number>s and cxs with the number of qubits this might seems ineffective well in fact multi qubit controlled operations that rotate a target qubits state depending on all possible states of all other controlled qubits in the register see uniformly controlled rotations would be much harder and challenging to implement experimentaly since for one thing gates are applied to qubits via microwave pulse sequences and to generate the precise pulse sequence which would be more complex as more more qubits are implied in the operation that would have the effect of the multi controlled rotation long coherence time for states resulting of the complex interaction between matter qubits and light mw signals must be achieved this is because we dont want our state to decohere as we are performing the multi controlled operation evidently nisq devices are not expected to support long and complex operation rather ppl in the labs have implement pretty performing su<number>s and cxs while cx are yet more demanding due to the entanglement property of the gate which has to be traduce in pulse sequence with quite low errors rate so all this to say we decompose the kfold multi controlled operations into an exponential of su<number> and cx because it is still more efficient in term of pulse design the sequences to apply etc and less prone to decoherence errors to do so,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SFVkQ0xIbHhUVy1LbU03TzhEUkxpOTg3dk1qLWNzZ1o4eElmMHNVbm5ENVRqYTFzZUZVQnJOR01uTVpjQzdhMXktR2lzTzlvZVpwUkhpYk1JaVpuVThvSzY0azdJRzBndVF0TDhkS0t6ckE9

the point is that you need the signal to be strong enough to measure at room temperature where you have a background noise because well you are at room temperature this is reddit so ill not go through all the math but a good rule of thumb is that you need <number><number> db of amplification to detect signal in the few photon regime now the challenge is to do this without adding more noise if you just added <number> db of amplification at room temperature you will amplify both signal and noise + the noise coming from the amplifier so you want to amplify with as low noise temperature as possible a jpa is lowest noise allowed by quantum mechanics a hemt at k is also good together thats typically <number> db then you need a lna at room temperature with at least <number> db of amplification if you dont have a jpa then more amp at room temperature is needed,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3OGdnTjhYUkhpNVFiblZTMnhwdkQyVVhMRW1GeHIycHFyTUFJSHJ6OXQ2TjNzMkIxLWtQSVBaNlhNNTlndjc2R3FmNFpab29LM1p5bGNDZnotbV91VXc9PQ==
the brown stuff is not a lna low noise amplifiers but they are attenuators cryostat is like a fridge meaning it as a specific cooling power so you cannot pump in large amounts of signal into the qubit because the released heat would damage the cryostat but at the same time you cannot generate the really small signals required for qubits at room temperature without any noise so you include attenuators but attenuators not only attenuate signal but also add thermal noise photons from the level they attenuate this means having all the attenuators at the baseplate will be best from noise perspective but it would mean that a large amount of heat is produced at baseplate as a compromise it is distributed about the different cooling levels similarly amplifiers also add noise when they amplify signal so its better to do it at the coldest temperature but twpa parametric amplifier actually functions at the single photon limit so minimal pump signal reaches itas far as i know the twpa pump signal is not attenuated as much as control and measurement signals this pump signals also produce some heat this means that all the amplification like twpa hemt cannot be done at baseplate level so the second stage amplification is moved to k where there is higher cooling power but once you do that you again amplify at room temperature,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Y2Z3VkIzWXJ3VXFQNlJ4SENhaDZIWmRoVkFDa0hRaTk0OV80RHlrNjdQNGVXLUdUOW04V0RZcjRtTXBGNmx3MHMwNVlpYk45VDJoUnZRandWZk95NWc9PQ==
hi thanks for answering so if i understand correctly the noise at room temp or the other stages would just overwhelm the output response so if we only amplified at the end our signal would have been lost would similar logic be applied to the attenueators of the rf signal going in,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3VmpZYjUxNUV3b0R1bkszNGgtRW1Cbzl4Z2VsdFNrTG00VmNlUXhxZDlDeDAtRWM2UkpxWC1KNkZLOEJMY0ZDT2FQR09SVldHQkpnbFJDcFNnNHFqaTROQndSUHVzMFNmY3VYYTJLWTQ3RnM9
like the other commentor mentioned those brown things in your diagram are not amplifiers ill answer the case for both devices since were all not sure what youre asking about we have attenuators at different stages to suppress thermal photons going down however these attenuators work by dissipating the photons to heat which means more thermal photons at a different frequency for the next rf component on the line as well as a higher thermal load for the cryogenic system at aby particular cooling stage thats why its distributed for lnas it can be shown that any amplifier must necessarily add thermal noise at minimum halfphoton in order to amplify a signal this noise corresponds to the temperature of the amplifier however we cannot dump too much energy into the jpa as it will start heating up the other components as well as other engineering and practical reasons hence we use a cascaded amplification scheme,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3aUlpX2ZVWDNKc1BsTEx0MlM5R3M0dmVQWGtLNnhmZ3BrR0gwcmQ3aVNXaWRFc09KZE5yMW1nSWtTaGxpTDVBR3V4azFMM2Y3Q0FVdkxxaVBHY1V2YVFzZUxEdGRmM0N4Z1hONG5BVzBOYms9
> so if we only amplified at the end our signal would have been lost yes > would similar logic be applied to the attenueators of the rf signal going in yes but with slightly different point on the input lines you need to make sure that thermal noise at room temperature does not cause noise at your device so again you need something like <number> to <number> db of attenuation on the input lines and things like eccosorb filters to filter infrared light but thats a different story,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3eXJQblNqSFlQZEFFb1Q2eWNJVlU5dWJmX3oyVTg4ZHE2ZmloV0hRbk03LXNkNWpRR2hCZGduZDMyQkQ2NWVKdE9oUUxVd05pVHFiNDZQS3p2RWxzQ2c9PQ==

these answers are super on point haha but you can model the signal going to a different state as a beam splittercombiner with the signal at one port and thermal noise at the other port and the combined signal at the output amplificationattenuation at each stage allows you to amplify the most signal compared to noise attenuation going down helps you attenuate the thermal noise more than the signal since the thermal noise is higher at higher stages thats the intuition at least for why the attenuationamp is at every stage,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4OVhKdFUxV3ROMHVBaEd1cGNxdW5HeDhfRDVhUV9zM2xKRktWXzlpbXpHbXk4V2RaYXFBd0JaWEJSSngtbFZlNXVnVVkzdEhJMWVQLTJMNklEMEdCNmc9PQ==
i think you need to look at stuff like outgassing from solder and soldered components as well as whether the s parameters hold at cryo as well as room temp resistors and materials can go through phase changes at low temps and resistance also changes at lower temps due to stuff like thermal expansion and other effects from things like the drude model as electron or carrier mobility can be a function of temperature,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aWZVVFhwWFl3R0xnOWl4VkxJV3JJQ1RYTlJBRVVjbEI5X1hVUy1KSjlLd2pCcWgweEVZV0lEYVNPZlliNllkRzRFZkhWMGprd1RwWTVuN2FnWXZiZFE9PQ==

yes i agree theres a squid magnetometer at osu ive used a similar mpms machine many times before theyre pretty common but the squid itself the magnetic sensor device not the instrument which is confusingly sometimes called a squid is not at room temperature it is at liquid helium temperature because it needs to be kept cold to be superconducting anytime youre working with squids they need to be kept at cryogenic temperatures which will drive up costs,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXZUl5cHQzTzhFUElvX25Rdzc1WE8yRGxSbGF0c3pFUk10cUxxY1hac25CSEJHMGh5WWI2VUdQRDhLVHJLZVowR2NMRUt5cjlEXzhiUWI5SlFsaktrQlg1WU5JQTAtbkpBS2dCcVpVWDczTDg9

matrix multiplication by unitary matrices are trivial in quantum mechanics any standard operation on a quantum system is in effect a unitary transformation im not sure about general classes of matrix products though there are quantum algorithms to do basic scalar multiplication but the suffer from scalability due to the high overhead of logical ancilla qubits needed i suppose a simple extension to matrix multiplication would involve extending the logical qubits to dbits bigger hilbert spaces but dont quote me on this im just thinking off the top of my head very high dimension matrix multiplication can also be done in multiplexed photonic systems which is kind of quantum and way more scalable so you might be interested in that <url> anyway the bottom line the same reason as every other quantum algorithm not enough good qubits yet and our algorithms need wayyyy too many good qubits,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXMEF3Q1FOdkpwdVZNRk9TZzRlR2dKa3pKQ3psTnVGTHFINEQ5QWRiWmpKaEtZNVNuRVMyUjA5SkRrUzB3MTRfazMzbGFocTQ5MXRObGRGbUxJMFhCTE1Cb3BFcy1aT09SeUZ1QkZuQWFTMzA9

no i mean the code for basic multiplication and addition of real numbers like an abelian group this is just a bitwise classical replacement for an and gate ie in order to do so you must use quite a bit of width as you want your qubit readout say <number> byte of them to read of a functional number you need a qft some qram etc this makes it into quite a beefy code,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmlSWmlEXzJ5TFFpNUxEMXFreUgtVklhRVJlb2ZSZ1FxZVFqZFdZVzJ5YUw3NW9aV1g3cXFNdU5wZFNjNkVIemNsb2NpTjdSdEJfam12WWljTUE1YWc9PQ==
i can easily take the example that someone else made with the classical and gate as a counter example first off that toffoli gate as nice and universal as it may seem is not the gate run in the hardware in reality this code is not <number> operations deep but probably <number> or more swaps and <number> rotations or so because that is what has the best resulting gate fidelities so lets assume that a real compiled code is <number> gate operations deep ibm boasts a circuit speed of <number> clops so that means this code runs in <number> milliseconds this will never be all that much faster as that is not how the physics on the chip work the traditional and gate requires <number> transistors sequentially the mosfet switching speed is about <number> nanoseconds meaning the classical and gate <number> nanoseconds this makes this example gate which i did not choose myself about <number> times slower you can code anything from a classical computer on a quantum computer but it is not without extra cost it is not universally better,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeXhMRElNb25YSktuUEpQZkpvWXMxY21sUFlib0lBWGlrRDBBamNMZXd4ZE02cTRheHFqTVNxdzAtUU1EbmY2Zk1UOWVnN1drQXNTaE5NSHpCeHcwS3c9PQ==
if you measure a qubit then you collapse the state into the measurement outcome <number> ns is abysmally short great science to get anything to work at room temperature however this is a qubit at ghz frequencies if you need qubit fidelities that are respectable operation times most be subnanoseconds which are impossible for initialization your feedback loop should also be on the order of a nanosecond practically impossible the biggest issue though is that they did not have individual qubit control everytime is done over an ensemble of qubits similar to nmr experiments in the s for any feedback to work you need individual access to individual qubits with hard fidelity they are nowhere near that,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMlhyYXM2S09zMHluRGN5bEcyUVVfbm1JWTZtLUZaS1ZsRUlNSkFsS0NJbjNDRF9tUHN5MzJBTlVYdUh2eWJwUUdvYlprbWZXSVNqUC14dFRsOU1NZ2c9PQ==

i think the confusion comes from the fact that many learning literature propose grover as an algorithm for searching in an unordered database and refer to the database as a blackbox even if the definition is not incorrect imho its counterintuitive in explaining what grover does the definition i like most from my computer scientist perspective is grover is an algorithm for searching a values x | fx = y where y and f are our inputs to the algorithm f could be anything a function checking for the solution of a sat problem an hash function or whatever when explaining it i always like to share this example i created myself where i use grover to search for a sudoku puzzle solution <url><url> it uses the qlasskit library so also the oracle is written using python code and then translated to a quantum circuit,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZODhSVlRDOUVBdUh1Zlh1QUJ1cVd1S1N2Vll6LWMyQXJZLTRyQkpDWFBRU3lYRlh4OEx4bDlrZ01BZEQwTlhLZTlhVHVmQS1DdlJOVXlIYlhER3FmRHc9PQ==

superposition is a mathematical term wherein two solutions of a linear differential equation can be added here its kinda the same so its purely a mathematical artefact but for physical intuition you can imagine it to be a new state that can be interpreted as <number> and <number> at the same time and the coefficients accompanying the terms are related to the probability in your case when hadamard acts on <number> or <number> it creates a superposition of <number> and <number> one with the same phase and another with the opposite phase,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhaGxhNzZVVlRYMXEtQlZBRUhUbW53aU5yb2FHdkIwTWxzTTJHSXJ1SmVuX3RGY2t2TFRmUXdpeDhtdS1aZDBTYWViOW1hNHR4NUt2NEd4T0JmYXI0WWc9PQ==

both are sort of true there is a little bit of both states in there but the state is neither |<number>> nor is it |<number>> there are infinitely many superposition states but all of them have some overlap with |<number>> or |<number>> as an analogy if you travel at a <number> degree heading towards the northeast are you going north or east or both are you traveling exactly north or exactly east or neither there is a direction in this analogy a state which is not exactly the same as the directions north and east |<number>> and |<number>> and yet is a little bit of both superposition,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc0tPQ3dsX0dxSkgzZzg3TWFhYm94REMySlFSX3prLVRXMXB4TnlNMk81ZU5JbEZlNjV3MjlWNHBwejl3X0VWUzJyeGdaMGZsS0o4THo5X0hJTmtXR0E9PQ==
microwave pulses are applied to the qubit in such a way that it has a <number> chance of being measured as either <number> or <number> it either absorbs the discrete amount of energy or it doesnt and you find out which happened afterwards when observing the state before you measure is a superposition which doesnt have a good physical interpretation it can only be understood probabilistically so what is called the energy of the superposition state is really just the average value of the two energy states,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQ0U1bHVaRlZUSTJSbmtLd0xtVmtLLUJiYTMtQlBJN2pncmtMOGN3ZFJlSG9qcHlLaFBGSTh1T05WU05lLTAwZVFyWkhhaHYyaGRPSHRxTG5BU2FQQ2c9PQ==

a very easy to read article illustrating these techniques <url><url>,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUEwzWVJfVGl3eDBHU3dFU0cydzFHYUFsYnpSRzRoMWF1dzJtV0ZFQVBpanpuWnBZS3ZJN0lTdTQ3aVFMUnlPTmRRcWlWR0FiLVZjanpzeW94dGVhT1NMVW5MV1BHWjBYcW1icEp2VlVuWkE9
do you have any benchmarks to compare with existing simulators theres a lot of people working on these and the state of the art at the moment is a fairly decent if youre looking for contributors you could probably start by reaching out to maintainers of other projects,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhb2JyTzIxRV8xUjRvSF9RRXY0Vnl4YmEtZzZERHlzbzVzbWV3X1dGYkp4VlZSTkhyVkxaWUhVSEFHb0lpWW5RTEF3NThXZ19qb3F3YlpOdVp6YjNHcUE9PQ==
your post is something like just a link or title with not enough text to have a meaningful conversation about it on the subreddit posts cannot just be a link or vague question please put more effort into the post,r/quantumcomputing,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMTJ2cGstWmcyUUllSVdyNFhBd0JIMy1EWTZmU2t0S2VwdEVPajI0QXFSVFpKcVAzU3pQeURwN25GN2VQQ0ZoOWlNM19Fc09JS1VjX29RYU9UU2dMZDhBakdBYzJsUWdCUnppTlhxQkk1MTg9
