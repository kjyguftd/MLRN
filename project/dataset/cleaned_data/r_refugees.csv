hi everyone im posting this for a friend who doesnt have reddit shed like your opinions on the piece linked above heres the context i wrote this story for an online publication about motherhood and that its been hard to write because of the womans refugee status in the story i dont want to write anything that would harm the refugee community but leaving out the womans status also felt white washed and fraudulent after writing it doing edits and having in depth discussions with fellow writers about it i gave it to my editor she decided its best not to include the womans refugee status at all but i feel uncomfortable that this choice was made my a bunch of white people who may just be reacting based on issues with white fragility id like input from the actual refugee community,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQXNscC1RakY5ajlhUTRxZm5yaFktTXRmdER0dUpTZHZjc19YMUNDNk9kX1ZyMTd1N0pRbGhwLWZoeW12YnBkdnE2YXd5NWtaa1NWNjJ4Qk5rZVdQcGc9PQ==

how would you know somebodys citizenship status just by looking at them this woman could be a refugee an immigrant on a fiancee visa a skilled tech worker on an h visa or someone with temporary protected status if this is a true story you had no way of knowing if its fiction your narrator is leaping to weird conclusions in this story you are perpetuating some of the worst possible stereotypes about refugeesthat all of them are muslim that they are mentally ill or violent none of those things are true the only thing we learn from this story is that the author is a privileged white woman with some deeply engrained prejudices also the trauma plot is super super tired,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSSjNGOGxqbEhHTVhXREE2dDFzQWRsSS1OcFJTcE5xeGZxd1VYbDhncldtWnlXSXFCdkUxeGF1c0RFMF8tUE9lT0U0RUJqeXFyTGNMMmJSWFJEWERlMUE9PQ==
honestly as someone who is neither a refugee nor white nor muslim i felt extremely uncomfortable reading your story i cannot begin to fathom how difficult nearly losing your child is but your characterization of the refugee woman rings extremely hollow <number> you included her refugee status off the bat meaning that is her primary identifier based on your internal biases and yes your gut linked her behavior to refugee if it had been a white person who happened to be a refugee would you have made that assumption <number> you pontificate on her possible trauma your act of sympathy is using a refugee stereotype of traumainduced violent mental health issues its an attempt on your part to pardon her actions but its analogous to a hard boiled detective in the <number>s noir film going the dame went hysterical its the nature of women to be emotional bless her poor soul but she really cant do that honestly unless you go and interview her if she is willing and able to consent you arent in a qualified position to tell this story in a way that wouldnt harm refugees you simply dont have the general knowledge or specific awareness of the refugee person involved as a result youre filling in the holes with stereotypes harmful ones at that it is still your story to tell you lived it but be aware that you can and will cause damage to another vulnerable group imagine the <number>s hard oiled detective telling the hysterical dames side of the story as well i appreciate your intention to seek guidance but sometimes the guidance is to defer writing it until you overcome your own prejudices through actively educating yourself alternatively rewrite anonymizing the woman refer to her as a woman since you cant in good conscience provide full characterization from the refugee identity last of all im sorry that you were subject to having you and your son threatened with harm,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSWHNDemhEV3ZYM1JjMThpZkNqS2xJWC1OR0M0VjVzU1B4MElwUnpkQ2FENVhvUFgxbU1nQVhQNmh3OTVTYW5WZld3VVRaemhXTjJVaDlOeS1MbUs0aUE9PQ==
i really appreciate the fact that youre reaching out i completely understand wanting to tell the story but i feel that when published publicly the storyteller has a responsibility to understand the impact which is what you are doing possibly this may be a story to publicly revisit after growth and to privately seek meaning on now as you are doing i also get the whitewashing but it comes down to what is the main message you want to convey your subjective experience of dealing with a potentialattempted kidnapping if so then the other details are irrelevant,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSd3Z6UFZVbWRRUW9QZGlPVmtoZEt3VVprMUxqN2xGdzNWZmVySmRlS1d4WFdqLUZRSVlfUUZETlFiZ1lwbVNXaHpwNVQxbXdVMlM4NVlDNWw2ckdJWVE9PQ==
the problem here is <number> context or not you have no way of knowing anyones citizenship status and <number> you have used this woman to center yourself and your own feelings the story feels incredibly manipulative to the readerit makes gestures at sympathy for someone elses situation but in in the end its the middle class white woman whose feelings matter please dont publish this it makes you look selfindulgent and selfabsorbed and whether or not you use somebodys citizenship status which you do not know you perpetuate harmful stereotypes about refugees and muslims this piece of writing is unworthy of you,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSU01aWFM1YmRHSUhHQ0txTjVWLVAydnhCZ3lFYnRsZ29fc1RpSFZvaV9xb19qaTkwRmVzTWthWTFWSHZPUVk1bWdYaC11MmhLSVFBWEdFUHMxVTR0Qmc9PQ==

thanks for sharing ive talked to a few people that have negative feelings towards their birth country so much that they have tried to erase parts of their culture like clothing food language did you have any experiences like that also if you have family still in your birth country how has that impacted you if anything is too personal you can ignore as far as refugees go i feel like people only have an image that is portrayed in the media they dont understand all the things that go with evacuating a country,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMXBfdEVtangzMmxzMFo0bTVGelJSU3pYa3d4ZE5qMU1JSklQbmp2TGQyNzJSRmdaNlJncWp4RzBZa1hHUllKRUZGZlNYYV9GdlgwTWhfNHRkS0Q2VHc9PQ==

i just moved from ukraine to the us one of the biggest issues im having is places in the us assume we are fraudulent and blocking new accounts we open paypal is now accepted in ukraine so weve just kept using our ukrainian banks we have an account in hyrvnia and one on dollar so its easy to transfer money to ourselves also opening an account depends on type of visa as well so it really depends on the bank different ones want different ids i opened a us bank account with lili its online and easy works for me maybe a prepaid account might work but in our case its been easiest to keep our ukrainian bank privatbank edit i just rememberedright now ukraine is blocking swift transfers to personal accounts due to russias invasion we inquired and are unable to transfer money from ukraine,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSZVNLVEhRYmRsZGsydlVQaE5UOVpyTEhiSGoySW5BZGhURlJrY3NxT3ZLb1JFTTRPTzhwZTFSdk1ObGhhRmRmRXpTdUFEcjZXXzVMNTh4ZldqemtnUlE9PQ==

in one way im happy to see this story being reported in western media in another way it saddens me that its reported most likely because she is a beauty queen there are so many countries suffering right now and its not being reported in western media because they arent white christian nations my family left ukraine at the start of the invasion and i am thankful for the coverage now we are in the us and the media is terrible it feels like it is only ads and propaganda being reported yemen and ukraine both started a war in <number> and yemen has lost more than <number> times the amount of civilians than ukraine somalia afghanistan and so many other countries are suffering even more because of the food shortage not to mention a lot of humanitarian aid has been redirected to ukraine sorry for the rant i dont want to minimise this persons story in any way this person is more than a beauty queen i want more diversity and common stories about refugees western media needs to change,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSa1ByUXZLeEx1OHRVUExDbkdMbXVrekN3aFdVZTB2UmRXREFuYkpLNjZJa1c2TVRxTEl1c2RReC1wWnRKbDctNF9tVnlEczdiUkpKN3ExaWd1NkVULVE9PQ==

no need to apologize im not an expert but here are some of my thoughts the us is huge ukraine is one of the largest countries in europe and ukraine is the size of texas if that gives perspective i think because of the size lack of public transportation and affordabilityrefugees and immigrants often end up in major cities larger cities tend to have more resources yet more people there could be a select amount of resources available and depending the amount of displaced personsit may be more or less easy to access those resources depending the situation ive noticed that red tape could also be an issue sometimes if resources require a lot of time energy documents required from the person needing assistanceit might seem impossible and they look elsewhere i also think freedom of speech has advantages and disadvantages people publicly voice their opinions and that can be intimidating and overwhelming for people that need assistance maybe a person would not ask for help because they fear of becoming a meme or publicly humiliated with that id say the us is far from united there are so many groups of people in the united states and it seems that a lot of them are relying on each other to feel safe makes sense at the same time it also means that a lot of people are more likely to help people that look like them capitalism seems to have taken a turn for the worse as well nothing is for free or given out of kindness the government charities and even religions have become more like businesses when we arrived in the usa the amount of ads was overwhelming it feels like they scare you into buying things you dont need like insurance imo im not going to pay a company to possibly pay me for something that may never happen it makes more sense to me to put my money in a savings account anyway i got sidetracked its like the us tries to keep people usually poc or low income in debt so i feel like displaced persons that truly need help arent sure who to trust or dont know how they can access the resources available to them some other things that come to mind racism language culture again im not a professional or have no real data supporting my thoughts im just assuming and basing off of my experiences so far,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSejNTX0FjaVBhSFFGUVNILTZ4dXZhekN0X0t2Q2l1alY2UXRUNDB0QU9UdmhWeVJjWE5meUtRbVExQ1F0ZHNqbXM4ZzdWVWRzdnBlRGViTnJjR1VXakE9PQ==

the primary reason its not a priority for the people who would give the aid for some they are struggling to put food on the table themselves so their priority isnt other people others the priority is to the people already here others it is a priority for those they consider need the help the most for others it is a priority to give to those who will also keep our citizens safe for some they are struggling to put food on the table themselves so their priority isnt other people others the priority is to the people already here others it is a priority for those they consider to need the most help for others it is a priority to give to those who will also keep our citizens safe i am big on helping displaced people and i think that we as a nation can help a whole lot more and still help our own citizens but like it or not we are not a bottomless pit of money and <number> million people including children and people all on welfare are going to have a difficult time taking care of <number> million displaced people if we had to do it all on our own so i think it is ok to validate some of those fears of making displaced people the top on the priority list but still help others to understand what is going on and encourage them to help despite those fears i am big on helping displaced people and i think that we as a nation can help a whole lot more and still help our own citizens but like it or not we are not a bottomless pit of money and <number> million people including children and people all on welfare are going to have a difficult time taking care of <number> million displaced people if we had to do it all on our own so i think it is ok to validate some of those fears of making displaced people the top on the priority list but still help others to understand what is going on and encourage them to help despite those fears i think the second reason is a lack of knowledge you dont have to spend much time with government leaders to find out that even those who are liberal often dont have a clue as to what happens with displaced people or dont understand the differences in refugees versus asylum seekers versus parolees versus illegal aliens versus sponsored etc or dont understand the security processes and that lack of knowledge can sometimes create great fear what i have found is that when i validate fears and really listen to people then they start to listen to me about displaced people,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSTURmNmtwd3I0Z2ZNVVlBV2dGalVURUFlR3QzRFFScjVaUE5DYi1HN1hSMG95UXliQkVYNzk3S0tvSzVJbG05VDlCeGJJN3AydnlhR3B5eXhEWlJLQnc9PQ==

i dont know what interview you mean but its probably about gaining refugee status am i right it also sounds like you are asking whether or not you should request somebody to interpret your documentation rather than whether or not you should request somebody to interpret for you so that you can be sure you understand questions that are being asked of you well this is a pure guess not based on experience i will bet you that they would not be willing to accept your interpretation of your documentation they probably will however accept the documentation itself they just would want to provide their own interpreter to make sure that the documentation is exactly what you say it is,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSSk42dG5SUDRkV2lwQ2pZaDhySG5idko5bHFwYjRBY1djM0NQdUsyMHJINDcwMGJhLVhHaC1lWGVvbjNhUV9SX3lVSjJsTnBUTDdHb0NsNFgyeU40MkE9PQ==
i have two thoughts <number> have someone else review and verify the translation of your supporting documents even my wife did that and she was the vicechair of her linguistics department at the college in her native country where she was employed to teach english she also served as professional translator and interpreter still she had one of her subordinates verify the document translation <number> i would absolutely ask for a translator for any interview unless you are completely bilingual let someone else that is more bilingual than you worry about getting the translationinterpretation correct so you can completely focus on formulating the most truthful and accurate answers in the language you are most comfortable in,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJST0Zwd0VyUEpheG8yOFFjS05ZLWtTdUljN2c5QXNzRDFBYVJDRS1TMnJSVGdfb21BdDhxWVlsUzVoeXliZENXQlpUSUxicE9rZ0RtMDlURFItWnNpeGFDMkI0Sjlzcm9uWHVnZjlackFEcXM9

you have a better reason than most asylum seekers right now more than likely youll be let in but you wont have a court date for like <number> years you also wont be able to work for a year but youll be safe which is your main priority our asylum process is designed to protect you not help you get a job which is why most migrants come here if you want safety then we have what you need well feed you and shelter you until youre able to work it is very difficult to get deported from the us even if your asylum application is rejected as an alternative mexico is underrated for asylum you can begin working much quicker in mexico than in the us but you need to stay in the safe areas of mexico jobs in mexico pay less but the cost of living is cheaper americans are actually migrating to mexico to escape our cost of living its at crisis levels ideally you want a remote job in the us while living in mexico so that you have the american income with the mexican cost of living canada is an option too but they are stricter than us and mexico if you decide to come then god be with you on your journey ,r/refugees,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSVktyVUhZazczSE1XUG9vaFN5YXJWeF80bTc5YnUwZkl2WlZWNGtVYmJ6bE9pM2FBbmwwcU5UTWQxR1hqTDdFekhfN1ZqcXdKMnZoWmRIdUpOV3lCOEE9PQ==
