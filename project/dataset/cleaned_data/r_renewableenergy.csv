expect natural gas to decline as storage grows intermittent renewables replace baseload generation as the cheapest source of power coal is dropping off because even at very high utilization it is not cost competitive with wind or solar which causes the utilization to drop which drives up the cost which causes the demand to drop gas is expensive and is only competitive when it is the only game in town which in an intermittent economy is only when intermittents followers demand hydro and storage collectively cant keep up,r/renewableenergy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQRDkyUFRsYmhHeEZudVhyY2VXTmRWc25odjlxSEh1VTRDRlNrTzJ2SGlCSkJRS2Y5XzVRTjV1Z2VhdTNWbmwycEF6eTlRQkhnUklFaENCTEZwYjltM0E9PQ==

i agree that ppas have been crucial to the exponential growth weve seen in renewables deployment but when amazon adds a datacenter to the grid its still adding energy demand that wasnt there to begin with even if all that energy is offset with solar power lets say amazon builds a <number> mw datacenter in california that consumes <number> mw at all times throughout the year they also build a <number> mw solar plant in california for simplicity lets assume the annual mwh consumed by the datacenter equals the annual mwh produced by the solar plant so all of the electricity of the datacenter is offset by the solar plant when the sun is out the solar plant sends <number> mw to the datacenter covering its load and send the remaining <number> mw to the grid when the sun is out the <number> mw being sent to the grid isnt replacing power that wouldve been created by fossil fuels because california already has enough solar during the day then at night theres <number> additional mw that have to be produced by fossil fuels because of the demand of the datacenter when fossil fuels are the main source of energy for the grid adding marginal load results in dirtier less efficient power plants producing more energy adding additional flat load to the grid results in increased emissions even though all the electricity is offset,r/renewableenergy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNnlvYXo1VWhjek5kcVNoNTRuQktOR0ZGckh1SHZpT1EyYXhRTnZaYnhxdEx1cm5FakNiZ1MzbWk0VnRBMUZCelBMcFF4alc2VmRjVm8tWExmM2ZHZWU0SkNpemc2RDk1RzF6UkhhMDllVWc9
