depends entirely on what you want to do with it off the top of my head id say a closed loop controller featuring an oscillatory modulation algorithm for walking which would require some reworking of the physical architecture or feedbackdriven algorithm for balance forwardinverse kinematics based logic for custom motions the simplest option would be to target that last option and use something like the copelliasim instructional materials to get you going with it the math is a little intense at first but its not bad once you get used to it the other two strategies are pretty specialized and may require an undue amount of learning,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaGRKWHd3SHp5M3lYMjYzUVBscGV4S1NSZXJGcmY0ZUtudWRyLS02REp4cXRWVGhnczhLT0JXc0NCcGo5U0c0elNRdUNiakdIRzZjVWxIeGNNZWx4dVE9PQ==

not sure if this is a troll post based on the dodge background also not sure if you mean control like how to wire and code or what is the best conceptual approach if its wirecode youll need at least one other component to drive the servos its not recommended to power servos straight from the arduino board as it cant provide enough amps you can either buy an ic servo controller or a servo hat or something similar as for coding just ask chat gpt to do it for you i use it all the time if its a conceptual control question you could try accelerometers sounds complicated or a bunch of potentiometers that read angle of your joints an esp is probably better for this project as they all have bluetoothwifi and can use esp home to talk to each other lastly i dont think that thing is mechanically capable of actually walking good luck,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZM3g2c05kTkxpVmJqNmFoQmpSMFhxQUZyNTh2X3ZfUDZRbWx6RlRSUFBjU2N4c1M2Wi1tMXFBaHNyb3RCUG1rbU4tbk1qSDkzY3RuRFgyaERZUk42cFE9PQ==

yes you can buy a simple wall wart <number>volt dc adapter power supply a <number>volt one is fine too but the motors will move a little slower a switching supply is more compact than a transformerbased one you just need to figure out how much current you need the best way to do that is to hook it up to the battery and measure it with a multimeter while operating probably around <number><number> amps will be good if the servos dont stall alternatively you might be able to use a <number> a usb adapter,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMDVqWTNBemZxNEg4VW9rU1lUUWZxNnZkakhxdjQtZG1IRG9PT2lvaGswekFSS1R6THVpOTVVcmx1ZXR5TndZMVdzS0xVZFpRLS03Q01kdHI2ZTRxLVE9PQ==

interesting so it sounds like i could use the wall wart and connect it to a dc barrel jack and use some wires to connect it to my power pins on the controller i believe last year u was able to consolidate the wiring to use one power supply for both the servos and the controller but will need to look up the schematics to verify if i misinterpreted what you recommended please feel free to let me know where im wrong i appreciate the input greatly,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYnVTc0JpSkZjNS1SQ1FpUENybHNYcS03STh2YlphLS1PcHlYNXVSWklQZlRucFE1dVNhVUNuV2ZOU2U0Q19zMWsxaUVmSFhGaWxSeHFYcEZqQU5zVHc9PQ==

what you will actually be working on will determine which things are gaps or unnecessary there are lots of topics within robotics and calculuskinematicsdynamics only apply to some of them that said the kinematics course that i took in my undergrad as an me was a biomed engineering graduate course the dynamics exposure i got was simple planar or rotational rbd which was not terribly useful since it gets way more complex when things become d vector calculus odes and pdes have been very useful although pdes came up more for computer vision which are now being replaced by neural nets so even if you were taught those things you might need to relearn them in a new context anyway,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRmFrTU9XQ0hMX2pEb3Jxd2V2RTdMZEtEVUdia2NPV2tWMzJJMV9PRXRmT0NNMkFTNnhoXzc1SEZDTm1pUkIyUGtPYVpGZXJYSjZIdTFSRUJkRHZoRFE9PQ==

i think the best advice is dont rush into a program because its hype build your own roadmap that outlines the theoretical foundations and applications you want to master you dont need an ee degree to connect and use modules from sparkfun but if you are trying to build fancy powerbattery systems you probably wont end up doing much actual robotics motion planning perception and control there are separate degrees that focus more on the specifics of building hardware robotics is more about the high level algorithms and systems theory despite a lot of companiesprograms marketing it as a fully inclusive engineering field,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeFJ4eVRRZWhUd0h5NGkwNmlsRVpFdDhoaHl1b0U3R3FfOTUwckwxTUhjMHQ1ZjlldGswYUpwQmdEd19BdVBlQXJ1ZjJhRm1ZRk03OTBuakJRNlFnc1hJNFFfLXN2LUdBOWlKTXlDVFhHMXM9

what im getting at is that youre unlikely to learn much at the undergraduate level that will be directly useful to graduate level work in robotics if you have the prerequisites to get into the program you will learn the other stuff you need while in the program either through coursework reading papers or with handson practice without the prerequisites you will simply not get accepted in that case if you still wanted to pursue this direction you will know exactly what you need to complete the missing prerequisites at an undergraduate level the only real exception is improving your overall math skills so that you can pick up new mathematical subjects more easily so go learn dynamics kinematics linear algebra more calculus if you want but dont expect the specific stuff you learn to be directly useful,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRllzenJza0dsWU9HUmhObnJMbmprb0k5ZC1adzBCNXVTR0Q1MzFlbTYyeWJrcHlNSVJEVjVfMC1STm56SWdlc0V6TUZWMl9XRVVPcDYtdVh1anhWcVE9PQ==

your best bet is not to use batteries there are tons of christmas lights that are powered via wires theres very little reason not to just run a cable to it draining a battery isnt going to kill the motors or servos probably unless you really abuse the battery and it catches fire x v mah getting drained in <number> minutes means you had mah of capacity draining it at c would kill it in around m thats a average that doesnt sound right to me that means you are not sure the actual power draw or the capacity for your x v pack was not mah so you can do one of two things for <number> hours you should calculate your average draw and then get x that draw in battery capacity so if you draw on average a then you need mah to last <number> hours or you can plug it into the wall and use a v supply rated for your peak not average current that would be basically summing each motors max draw or if you want to get fancy group the motors into which ones will be on at a given time and size the supply for the maximum of each of the groups since not every motor is on all the time then it just doesnt die,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNjFXQU1VSklyR2t5clBHOGQ2U0R0TWFDMG53Ynl3OF94S1Qzb1FnYXdJZWVOTjZHR3hhLXM1WUJhSWRlMFU2Ty0xeDg0ZUFuYWN3QnZ0T2dvczN4RGc9PQ==

my advice unhappy though it may be is to curb your expectations somewhat the idea discussing jellyfish tentacles and such is a great one but its going to be quite complex to do you wont be able to do more normal styles of kinematics on it forwardinverse because all the things youve likely been taught making assumptions about your classes apologies will have probably assumed rigid linkages with specific pivot points what you may want to do in that vein is start with one tentacle possibly even slightly oversized and get a design that gives you the flexibility you desire but also can be characterized in some way so your control system can make a prediction about how to get from a to b bonus points if you really want something interesting with that approach find a way to design your control system so that it can have a length along the arm specified for where to consider the end effector namely imagine the difference between trying to place the tip of the tentacle vs placing the space five inches further back because the tentacle length at the tip is curled around things bonus bonus points if your softwarehardware can utilize different lengths of the tentacle for different usecases and switch between them dynamically,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadHZpTndrT2xaRjNoM091QkY5MFMzWHBJdS1JcUw0RVdLeHVoQ0lwNi1PYXRjSzJ4TlZKTmc1bEh3eGZhUjdHRzhVcnpvZ0oxSUxfOVRIYVg5TVBDYkE9PQ==

very tight tolerance and factory calibration each axis has an encoder that is accurate up to <number> of <number> decimal places th of a degree or better before a robot is shipped from the factory it is mastered using specifically designed jig and the encoder values are saved to a master file usually paired to the arms serial number if you look most robots especially large industrial ones only claim repeatability up to <number> to <number>mm remember each joint is measure to the th or better this is important repeatability vs accuracy most robots are taught using dead reckoning which replies on repeatability you move a robot to a position and teach that position the robot will then return to that position within the given repeatability tolerance accuracy is more like here are specific measurements go exactly there accuracy is not typically used in robot systems even in most vision guided system there is a frame of reference taught dead reckoning that reduces the area in which the robot needs to be accurate belt driven axis usually use a very very stiff timing belt specially designed for this purpose reinforced to prevent stretching i have seen robots that are yrs old or older with original belts never recommend this officially but it is not uncommon,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRHB6TVZKb3hsQVVUWUlqaUppUEsxVkQtd2IzTVhLS1dEUk84NHhLN2U3UC1FTE1MZGVOUXJ3UEh2bXV3b3pndGhEajkzYmNqQ1FJc3dnRG9OZ1dLbnc9PQ==

most brands dont actually calibrate each robots kinematic model further than the nominal model which is good enough for most applications the repeatability isnt affected by this but accuracy is usually you can pay to have a custom kinematic model for the specifics of an arm but usually not needed for example kuka calls these ha high accuracy where the specific arm is measured for a higher accuracy kinematic model edit each robot will be specifically mastered which makes it reputable to itself but wont account for inaccuracies on dimensions,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU3N1WkdobFdsMHZDVVhyTHVVeUR2WEF0TDFKdnJSSEJGbHYycWdwQTE0Z1hPLXVuVjhOaTBXWWE4Z2dPaWFmTjBzaU10N3lacWtfLUs0VW1ROEhlMUE9PQ==

the robodk software is awesome for the few demos i have seen but i am not sure it is the best tool to replace an oem programming package what type of applications are you intending on programming what level of control will the robot have robodk is excellent on path planning and trajectory planning it is limited however in the full command set available for each robot simple io processing like turning grippers on evaluation of part present sensors no issue complex if else statements recipe management system control proceaaing this is much better managed in the oem environment if you are not looking for lots of offline simulation check with your vendor about software packages purely for programming often it is the simulation package that costs the money not the programming environment,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMjBLZUxFdTVseG5md2Zpb0l1aEJib0lsNjJoNUlvZnRVWGlPSV84cE1PNENRSnQtNTJIVXlJdlVQYTFZd1FpSTJvbHNTbldua1pwQm15aXI5OEVseFE9PQ==

fanuc integrator here the robots come from the factory with some default mastering either by a jig or vision as another person stated above when we get them in well usually run through our own calibration with their irvision package to finetune the calibration to improve repeatability it really comes down to what the application calls for for example welding typically requires more repeatability than say palletizing boxes the calibration we do uses a camera and essentially moves the robot around and takes pictures of a grid we then run through several iterations of this program to zero in on better repeatability,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT2tVOEZZM3Y5eDJYZjlLYzBkNmo3R3hVdmFydlRsYXphYWtMTWxJRDB0dUVjYUxoalY2MTBZS0pXMTUyS3k5a1JxVkVHMjRjSmJydDlrcDZPLVZPWWc9PQ==

the answer to your question is less technical in the robotics sense and more of a socioeconomic discussion in my opinion the general public is quite hesitant with respect to robots taking jobs from people the coffee shop employees would likely feel that their jobs are directly threatened ive also seen that even highly skilled technical workers are hesitant to interact with robots due to being uncomfortable around them robots are also expensive capital purchases im not sure what the roi on one of those would be in a coffee shop the only technical reason i can see for not having robots in coffee shops as you describe is maintenance the videos you see online of robots performing these types of tasks dont show you all the times the robot fails the task requires human intervention or is down for maintenance reasons,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVWdpSzNqcGxkb2ZGZF9lTVNTMEFLNDk1STFfQjRrRWVYbm9Id29ObjdKbmwtNkpNWnVmUDJ5QUpqbDUtSVZVcWh6cGJ3b2t4bXAxOXZ1T18xclF3ZWc9PQ==

you will most likely want to use aluminum as your metal of choice because it is strong and lightweight <number> is a common alloy and is used in a wide variety of applications an aluminum tube type product might do what you want id strongly encourage you to prototype with d printing first since its cheaper and faster to iterate on designs than metal based prototypes in my experience do you have access to your own shop for prototyping metal components i ask because i do have a small home shop where i can fab small robotics parts but often i find myself wishing my d printer was in service so i could prototype faster there before going to metal,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaal8zVTY3NEpfS3l0UXdISDJiUUp4YkZfOWJyRTlIOE96dFczcXlReWIxYkFSUV8xWjc1UXFRcHY4QWdadE5vSGIzMVVsUEh4Z1M5X0sxYV9NWGh3akE9PQ==

you have to use the tesla approach the first model will be a <cur>k unit that will appeal to the rich and give you enough press coverage to attract enough investors so you can build a cheaper model for the mass market it has to have enough real features so it replaces a human servant or three clean dishes take stuff from the dishwasher to the cabinet do the laundry fold clothes clean the house do yardwork walk the dog etc guard the house at night or when you are not home all the mundane stuff that is easy for people but takes time and is currently very hard for robots a great benefit of a robot is that it can work <number><number> which is <number> hour work weeks instead of <number> it should be able to swap its own batteries with the other set that is sitting on the charger for anyone who has a big enough household so they actually use hired help a functional robot will be cost effective quite quickly who some silicon valley startup that then quickly get bought out by one of the big guys when hopefully in the next <number><number> years by that time ill be old enough to really need one,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZUY4ZEN6VEhJQW45Y1M5aEpOOC1sMkI0Mi0yWm5kdTU5V2JDMjJXdU5qRlpvSXgtUG1iQnVQdzZGYjFaeEFmalJ1dlFLVjRWTTZ3eXJUWVZVMjlwSXc9PQ==

robot arms are expensive to operate and teach program and even more expensive to integrate sensors into to reliably handle drinks and interacting with people and machinery meant to be handled by machinery it is far simpler to make a machine that can load the desired cup onto a turret and deposit the exact amount of whatever liquids or solids have been loaded into the machine from the suppliers but its even easier to hire people to make coffee and people tend to prefer human to human interactions rather than poking pictures on a touch screen and having a coffee whizz out food processing machinery is also complex to clean and is only economical when it can run nonstop robotics are also unsafe around people,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN3lrenFELXMwUDRqSW80NTZJYWViWVFoeXFnV01iVlJuck4xSDlvcWVmRkplVGI4R2JpR195Rmx6dlZTcDdXVkt6a3E5d3dTR2FCeWJsWkRhODFzQ1E9PQ==

your main differences are python being interpreted vs compiled vs cc++ being compiled python having some unusual syntax and cc++ being closer to the hardware with more nuanced control having experience programming in both i can tell you with absolute certainty that for basics getting into robotics python will be easier out of the gate and allow you to do more faster cc++ will be a much more serious learning curve but if you have the time and technical knowledge how to plunge into that deeply it may ultimately pay off in terms of more nuanced software control over your robotics and increases options in terms of hardware,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNjhUNVRMcU1nLWlpSHRaeUZJZ1hoSE1IRWphWDJnM1F4bW9fbGlhejhoc0xZOS1PNllqZ0l0RF9lelRtU1BEcjBzbHVCVUlZcGhtYUxITXp0bGV6RHc9PQ==

counter why not just grind beans boil water and make your own coffee at home or why not just get a keurig its hard to get much more efficient than pressing a button on a keurig its cheaper too answer because human interaction is actually large part of what you are purchasing when you visit a cafe its what many of these brands are built on as a barista im encouraged to learn peoples names and get to know them really unless im making something very elaborate im paid to stand in front of really a fancier and more expensive keurig or a blender or shake things together with ice i also clean because its a restaurant and bugs are nasty but im in large part evaluated with the customer surveys which give us a customer connection score,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUEhsUUYxZGE4S0NKaDhBenFhQS1FXzh6UnZpcDJWS1JfcWR2UURQaGhMejNtQ3ZtdkNYRUhnWVd0ckowVHFtLTZ2eWhPckJ6aXV0VHZsRFUzaC1PTWc9PQ==

hey i think the best way to approach this is not to buy a kit why a kit comes off as expensive and there might be so many components included in the kit which you might not end up using them at all it can also create confusion especially for total beginners i cant imagine staring at relay modules transistors ir sensors diodes and a bunch of motors all bundled up in one box while i havent even lit up an led this can quickly overwhelm someone you want to choose a project eg a line following robot controlled with an esp and a bunch of sensors then note down the components required as you watch over a tutorial then order those components as a bunch youd save money and also the kidsage <number>+ would develop an engineers way of thinking projectbased modular saving up on costs and only going for whats necessary it also makes it simpler to learn robotics imo i have mentored highschool kids in a robotics competition and it was so hard for them to do anything because they were all staring at these starter kits with all sorts of components they were very basic components but the theory behind even an ic lcd module can get you scratching your head,r/robotics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnazBrX0NsRXV5REZuX2MtVV9BRWk2cjE3eWlYQ0hzV3Q5Wm5waHhnOXpuTDk0d1AxM0w3SVNodHZOUkNVQnZ3bmVVYWFfTF93aFh5YjV1d3pZYm55Znc9PQ==
