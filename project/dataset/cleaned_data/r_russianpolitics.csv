its not false framing when putin has explicitly accused the current ukrainian government for being nazzis when people in russia mainly due to watching believe that zelensky himself is a nazi and that there is systematic extermination of russian speakers or people of russian ethnicity in ukraine by the explicit order from the ukrainian government i dont deny or even argue that there arent any nazis in the official military forces or even that they are overrepresented i am only questioning the accusation of the ukrainian government being nazzis from putin and his goons,r/russianpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSbkstdUM1TUM3ZFRJN1VkWUJieDVObUhOeHlUZkNDTGNjX2JYTWZ2aWNqUXowbWFETFBHR2tMTkw2ejJDZlZGdGZ1Z0R3Y29HNm4xTlVzeDdpbUcwNUE9PQ==

regional intelligence operatives have intercepted a huge amount of russian soldiers in ukraines calls to their families back home the russian dudes there want out and there wasis no morale or resolve to fight among them these men are pawns in the game part of a long history of male expendability in great power military competitive games they were lied to about what they were even doing they were told the build up on the border was a training exercise and got tricked into doing war crimes against people they would otherwise view as ethniccultural kin i think a good regional strategy is to help the russian soldiers surrender and the biggest hurdle to that is that they will face the real threat that their families and loved ones in russia will be persecuted for their actions either way this is much more viable to induce deescalation than any sanctions the us or western allies could impose on russia and russian oligarchs even sans troops which he is certainly running out of putin is likely to just switch to an airdominant campaign as we are already slowly seeing to continue the offensive but voluntary troop loss and the inability to do troopbased ground operations would be a huge loss for putin and an embarrassment because nothing hurts a militarist autocrat among his own regime insiders more than a massively failed ground operation,r/russianpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSTkJxUThGUG9TbjFTS1dad3hjLV94Z2h1QkllTEpWUVhFZEt0UVpVNzFOSFpxVFFIc0liQXpDR2liWjkwUHBMYTBManJydVg4SUtGNVRlZnFNOTBiaWc9PQ==
