this is amazing highlights but blackstones principal claim that sounder investments have led to higher returns is difficult to square with the ongoing decline of commercial real estate its hard to fathom how breit could have bought so many properties at the height of the market and yet somehow been selective enough to have dodged all the postpandemic downturns suffered by other funds according to breits own numbers data centers and student housing make up only a small part of its portfolio and many of the data centers blackstone says have already created so much value for the fund arent even up and running yet theyre still in development the alarm bells over breit go beyond whether blackstone is overstating the funds value breit has said that through june of last year <number> of its dividends were funded by cash flows from operations the money produced by its realestate assets but that claim is more than a little misleading in the measure of cash that breit highlights it doesnt subtract the expenditures required to maintain its properties which is standard for the industry in its own fine print in fact breit does provide several other measures that are more analogous to how most reits define cash flow by those measures the fund has never been able to cover its dividend from its cash flow the future of breit could also send shock waves through blackstones bottom line in <number> alone slcg calculated fees from breit generated <number> of blackstones total management fees and <number> of its performance revenue if breit and its sister fund bpp are forced to slash their navs by <number> the ensuing reduction in fees would wipe out over <number> of blackstones feerelated earnings earnings that wall street in contrast is expecting will grow by <number> according to blackstones financial statements its already anticipating it will have to pay the university of california <cur><number> million in breit stock an expense it doesnt count in the numbers it highlights to wall street if breit craters it will also be difficult for blackstone to live up to wall streets expectations for its longterm earnings growth which depend in part on its successful expansion into the retail market,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUkhiYnZBMFpDMS13VG5rVkxzZjMzYTZ5MUZrTDBFTG9JbW5IUGgxUks5TXRNWkpQclh6TG5USFVDaUs5ODNKdFU5S0JRZl9mOEF3QUdXOU1Zd1RBbllXcldNRmZmQUN3TndvRlVLcXdDWGM9

by the mids the whisper that boesky is buying could move markets and provide the lubrication that corporate raiders and others needed to pull off a deal never a raider or a banker himself boesky became a sought after ally of financiers like michael milken who were eager to keep the deals flowing even as the mergers became more misguided and the bonds sold to finance them became junkier in november <number> boesky pleaded guilty to conspiracy unravelling not only his own myth building but also the careers of milken against whom boesky provided evidence and others milkens investment bank drexel burnham lambert collapsed soon after in the wake of the boesky trading scandal congress and the securities and exchange commission passed new rules that defined insider trading for the first time leading to an era of increased enforcement and providing a road map for future investigations into wall street malfeasance,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUTVhPNGpmQnJMMWJrWE1DMUNwQWFlR3R5aFdtQVpvU3BSSG9FOHVHODBRQWZDNGMzTjlNZTdoZlBhcTJnc3ctaXl0TzZVdmhQWG5aYmVIUkwtbXBYRThMZ21NMHE1QjJtZmxJN0pXNWpraTg9

fundsmith is a great example of a marketable scalable open ended strategy however like all many open ended strategies there is an inherent liquidity bias in a postwoodford world this has to be at the forefront of every large retail open ended managers mind of course smithson although an unfairly timed comparison given the lag of the smallmid cap sectors vs large cap offers a look at the strategy without the liquidity bias currently trading at an ~<number> discount to nav<url> or at least that is how it is marketed fundsmith has managed to grow aum despite outflows<url> which shows that liquidity is not an issue at least the key man risk with fundsmith is very high vs berkshire and its not just because the fund takes his name but his more colourful behaviors those mentioned in the article as though they are charming antics are actually the most significant risk for investors one thing i would be curious about is the performance of a portfolio which follows fundsmiths process it would arguably hold a lot more japan vs fundsmith which would have likely helped performance this year would it be better to just buy the top <number> stocks that return as an output of a pretty simple screen obviously the future assumptions are the tricky part of any screen than pay bps for fundsmith to as they put it do nothing i am sure somebody will have tested this to see if they outperform a tight qualitygrowth screen,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlSmdtOUNFeGlIaEdIQkxJSWduUm1kQXhiOHd4M0ZzTXJkSzllRnJqSVJXZ2tuNUtNLTVhWjBXMHRPTkpGN0hDSXdJZzJRNlkwa3JnbXM5S3A4SDdjQWc9PQ==

thanks for posting this was an interesting read im broadly sympathetic to the idea that live nation may be enjoying certain monopolistic advantages but there were a few points in your piece that i wanted to push on a little bit would love to have a discussion with you on these points if you are interested and have the time <number> the compensation package the ceo received in <number> actually covers the next five years obviously he received the cash component in <number> but the stock awards vest over the next <number> years based on performance look hes obviously extremely well compensated on a cash basis alone but its misleading to say something like <number> of the firms operating income goes to the ceo because thats just one years operating income against <number> years of compensation <number> on the discrepancy between the aoi they message to investors and the profit margin they focus on with regulators the main difference is ticketing contract advances and da expense these are real expenses that should be considered in their discussions with regulators i can see why this feels like they are talking out of both sides of their mouth but fundamentally its because the two audiences are interested in different things however if anything i feel aoi is the more misleading number as i definitely see how games can be played with the ticketing contract advances to inflate aoi however this is not an issue with profit margin <number> evaluating the impact of fasb pronouncements and disclosing such evaluation is just business as usual and not necessarily a red flag its good to take a fine toothed comb through the disclosures and there could be something here but at the end of the day this is circumstantial and could easily be nothing <number> profit margins are substantially higher internationally because live nations low margin concertvenue business is negligible internationally here i will just quote you in the us live nation has a giant capital intensive unprofitable division of putting on concerts in my view confusion around reported numbers is not enough to allege shady accounting or fraud as we should have a very high bar for these allegations <number> euus price discrepancies are observed across product categories with the common denominator really being the large and growing wealth disparity between the two for example the average vehicle price in the us is something like <cur>k but only <cur>k in europe thanks again for the post and sorry for the long response here but i thought you might enjoy a broader discussion on the work you have been doing,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJubkxjN0RTNkFBYlNUZVE0dUpPektDYl9kaWlJU2g5cGpMRzR4Y0d1TTlxNU9mLTJ2cEJhTkZmeHIyY3lrelFOSXRMNnQwRFpyQ0x6LWFBTFM0VTE0SlZ6U3k1WFliMkJZUTE1T1FSWjVfenc9

>generating true alpha is not about luck or market timing its about consistent repeatable processes one must be disciplined often contrarian and not swayed by market noise one must dig deep into fundamental valuation understand the nuances of the underlying businesses and have the patience to wait for the thesis to play out rather than chasing beta true alpha hunters often hedge their beta exposures and manage risks meticulously they are not afraid to stand alone and wade into offthebeatentrack markets and securities where there is little to no research available while usually having a high degree of capital structure corporate or legal complexity in other words there is no free lunch,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwNzJBRFZ0YS03Vk83V2dHWEM5SmVaR19naVlfdk8zcTdXSDdtWVpQTFVseWhFc25zV19pb3BJT3lWcndsSUh5Vl9fT09jM05SbEN1TzljdGM1MUpQMk5abE1LbFhMUUtXV3NxQUtQYUUycEU9

yes thinking about it in terms of economic interests and voting interests is the right approach the voting interest is what will determine who holds the controlling interest paramount global is another great example shari redstone controls something like <number> of the voting interests in para through her control of nai her holding company yet she only owns something like <number> of the economic interests of para despite her low of economic interests she is the controlling shareholder given the disproportionate amount of voting shares she holds that brings up a second point often when you see these differences between party a holding most of the economic interests but party b holds most of the controlling interests there are two different classes of stock that accomplish this one class often only entitles a holder to a single vote or no vote at all while the other class is considered a supervoting class thats the case for para its also true for lvmh to your example i havent read the proxy or further detail on the a and b stock but that appears to be the case here so while the public float holds <number> of the a stock the reason they are not controlling shareholders is because the b which is majority held by the founder are very likely supervoting shares stepping back in terms of control in your example its clear that control folds up to mr peterffyhe controls ibg llc through his control of ibg inc which he controls through ibg holdings llc in terms of economics the economics also mostly go to mr peterffythrough his <number> membership interest in ibg llc which is where all of the opco assets are held and thus where the cash is generated and distributed from so sure the public float has <number> of the economic interest in ibg inc but that only equates to <number> of the economic interest in the actual opco businesses cash flow <number> goes to peterffy who also controls the entire structure on your last pointif say company c holds the majority membership interests in b itd mean c has the majority voting interest in b does that not make c having the controlling interest of b even though a is the sole managing member of b not necessarily just because c holds the majority of membership interests in company b does not mean that c has the controlling interest these membership units could be purely economics with no voting power which is what the footnote implies although i havent dug into any other filings the footnote reads as though ibg inc holds all of the control of ibg llc but remember the control of ibg inc is held by mr peterffyso whether the control of ibg llc is held by ibg inc or ibg holdings llc is almost irrelevant because it all boils up to mr peterffy holding control hope this helps,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQR3BGWWhTbHFGVnhHSWstWW1lYXZ6dTIxNTBTdEZGTE5nV3JZVTdoczNjN21BNWVXN2JQVzNzWWxhZU1GbzBsT2duTldBZHlvaVdpOHpyS2VueUpweHc9PQ==

thanks for the explanation on this point of yours >not necessarily just because c holds the majority of membership interests in company b does not mean that c has the controlling interest these membership units could be purely economics with no voting power which is what the footnote implies although i havent dug into any other filings are you suggesting membership interests can be either economic or voting interests or both you seem to suggest the <number> membership interests peterffy has in ibg llc are purely economic my understanding was membership interests necessarily include both economic and voting interests the other clarification im seeking is the definition and impact of sole managing member on controlvoting based on the ibkr example here it seems that sole managing member implies control but not necessarily the main beneficiary of economic interests,r/securityanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXbWdNN05DN1ZoS0pNVWc2aF80ZE40THZpdEFFT1I5YkNKZVRlTWxkcHhsUWtiVXN3R1V4anlJbVl4aDljTnUxU0FGVzVuUFRJcVV2MWkyWXdETEpqX0E9PQ==
