what pushed me to that conclusion is the fact that life seems so extremely unlikely the conditions that must be met for intelligent life to exist seem impossibly rare i know in the grand scheme of things we havent been looking for that long but so far weve seen absolutely zero signs of life beyond earth i dont think humans are special i actually think if ais become conscious then theyd probably be more special and better than us i am a human so of course i like our species more than any other but i do not hold anthropocentric beliefs,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR2xIM3dzUVdpOWhYaS11azNMMGVvLUUwbkRDd1kzQzVveWtJZjJoVXRXQUp2THgtSUVBMGJkd045UGlUOUtSejNOWHg4ZE1NWndKSERJcjVqUWlrNHc9PQ==

its not about what is most likely it is about what is possible the ground assumption of the fermin paradox is that there should be thousands ot even millions of intelligent civilizations but we see none since we have verified the early assumptions about star number and larger planet number we have to find some filter which turns the result from the drake equation from millions of galactic intelligent civilizations to zero since we didnt yet fit that description to be effective a great filter needs to be almost entirely impermeable if a sociological factor is used such as they didnt want to go outside their home system or theyll send printed to monitor but not colonize then you need an explanation why the millions of civilizations follow this rule universally the dark forest hypothesis works as a sociological explanation because it only requires one enforcer and its reasonable to think that there might be one enforcer in the large galactic community everyone voluntarily choosing not to explore though isnt reasonable because we are exploratory so we already know it is being violated at least once,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3pmUmx0U2p5VF84cS1qOFQwdV9YV0J3MDRUcmdjVlFXNzBVNzNPdUU4Qk9BN0RVZ2lYYnZhbUQwQVRnRnVwY2hrUDdmYUNXWGpHMmlUdzVHT0dFZXc9PQ==

most likely reason for that is that we have not really started looking we do not even know if there is other life in our own little solar system there could be still simple lifeforms on mars or even more advanced hiding in the oceans of several of the moons we have done nothing yet to actually search for life with exception of the viking landers on mars and that experiment was flawed the only kind of life we could possible detect outside of our own solar system right now is super advanced civilizations with a dyson sphere and if we found signs of one we would brush it away on more likely explanations like we have done already either way i think advanced lifeforms mastering space travel is incredible rare we have some intelligent creatures here on earth but none has both the brains and capable hands of creating even simple tools like we are blessed with,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZzNGVnRMVENGeWtrNDFzNm91ZmNGZDh4MXRpVkgtMS1ZWUhuSXZLZmlaTmJoeDFqQ3JselJyT3U4WHBwaWZMTFVEY0RVdzZzSS1QalNjNE1xLWFfanc9PQ==

this question is weird for me because i dont think there is actually a self that dies just a system that ceases to function i believe that i dont actually exist in a concrete sense and im just retroactively created as a tool the brain uses to interact with the external world so i believe that if this system were to be destroyed and a cognitive reproduction of it was made i would be reborn simply because that system would create a self continuous in evolution with the one being used now basically that being will say that she is me as she would have the same beliefs and memories as this one who currently claims to be me im not sure if i made any sense but this is how i see the issue,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWWZ3UFhkU0pGV0ZTaF9ERktwb0V3RlVlSHJWRk41REw3LWN4bUZQNmg0SUdxa2lFd2VyQklmRHpSd0lnSDFpb2VSWjdDLVJTeC1PTG0tYTBlV0FZSnNtVTlrbHJrc3JvMXpyOFl1eUhFd289

yeah thats what i was going to say im not sure theyve really got the point of the laws as in they dont actually work ive seen a good youtube video that goes into much more detail and basically they come up with the conclusion that its basically impossible to come up with any rules that are water tight or even marginally tight just defining exactly what the word security or harm mean and all the different interpretations of them means its nigh on impossible to interpret that into something the machine can understand thats not to say its impossible to control robots but it probably means you will have to go down to the machines level and define the parameters and limits of its actions and what exactly things like harm mean in the context of its allowed actions which will probably take a lot more time and effort which im not entirely sure it goes with the tech industrys motto of move fast and break things,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa1BtU0RWdDJHRGJuNHVfY216MFl5SUpKNjlyUURnUi1DeXJtcUFpYlZXYTJxSWFocVVmbUhnYkFpSWlocE54TXMtaXlsSlp3MEx6cllLV09TUnJCd3c9PQ==

i feel like because todays computers are fast use electricity and are intelligent people make analogy with our brains and think it can be conscious what if you replace the computer thats supposed to be conscious by a machine that does the exact same computation and has same outputs but does that x slower and doesnt use electricity but very basic mechanisms would it still be conscious if the same computer thats supposed to be conscious due to its intelligence does random and totally unintelligent computation meaning physically there is the same electricity behaviour in the computer except that its completely useless and unintelligent computation then is it still conscious a person who had their brain destroyed and became very unintelligent can be way less intelligent than current llms but are obviously still conscious i mean its really obvious that consciousness and intelligence are different things if current computers achieve super intelligence due to clever algorithms thinking its conscious implies thinking that stones are conscious consciousness is not understood yet but its clear that consciousness is not an algorithm its very likely stuff happening in the brain with the purpose of consciousness and not intelligence penrose talks about microtubules in the brain and quantum mechanics thats speculative but it sounds like consciousness has more to do with that kind of stuff than being an algorithm,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa0hOekttQmlKRldERUVkMklKaEV4Rkw3UUw5VC1DV3htMHZyYlZWanY4dFZDNUdtOVQ2Vko2LXV4TjJfVUh1QkZiS29uVzE0Q01PMXNuVU9kLU91Rm84c1duQjJhSDEwQ3VodDlPb1pXYTQ9

it really doesnt matter if you are satisfied or not what i said is deductively and hence objectively true its like disliking a mathematical proof when your intuitions do not match that it is the intuitions that need to be analyzed and corrected to be sensible again we are not talking about how practical it is but whether someone can claim that llms can impossibly be conscious as i demonstrated llms can be conscious assuming human brains are and physicalism holds etc hence the interesting discussion should shift from whether llms can be conscious to whether current llms are that is what we want to know and that has to make use of something about current llms vs what llms could be rather than just some flippant blanket statement note that i am not arguing that llms are conscious or will be conscious soon those are more things that would require the things you are looking for i am just giving the simple proof that the blanket dismissal is invalid and something more sensible is needed most of the points you make seem to be incorrect not true if we are not talking about sgd+common crawl then we are not talking about llms no that is not the definition of llms and does not even cover all llms that exist today i also explained how you can even get the property we wanted from sgd and its not like llms should be restricted to common crawl not true one shouldnt have to prove that all possible configurations of a very large language model cant have something equivalent to consciousness that is precisely what you need to do if you want to claim that llms cannot be conscious that is literally what the statement means not true arguing that our current methods of assembling those configurations are very unlikely to yield such one should be enough it depends on what statement you are making a lot of people are making a statement about what must be true for all llms not just for current llms if you want to make a statement about current llms then sure we can say that it is currently not simulating a human brain if you want to make a claim about whether llms could get there i dont think you have made a case for that the difference matters a lot for example because the methods can change i also already described a different process that is feasible it also is insufficient simulating a human brain is a sufficient way to argue that llms can be conscious provided we have ideal data however and this is important we also know that simulating a human brain may be sufficient to argue that an llm can be conscious however it is not a necessary property so just because current llms do not simulate a humnan brain you have not concluded that it is not conscious the implication only works in one direction not true if youve given that up as an argument then youve basically given up any argument that is relevant in the real world the exact opposite if you give up on valid logic then you give up on making any relevant argument if someone makes a general statement that applies both to a situation where the conclusion is true and a situation in which the situation is false then the argument has been proven incorrect if you are not familiar with logic you need to update that intuition it is fallacious and a very common method of rhetoric to use invalid arguments and then trying to rationalize away counterexamples in order to make a sound argument it has to make use of something that distinguishes situations where the conclusion is true from where it is false a blanket statement that llms cannot be conscious does not do that like i said before the whole point is to reject incorrect blanket conclusions and any sensible analysis must make use of the properties that hold for llms anything else is just people tricking themselves with bad reasoning it is also a rather telltale sign when people make bold statements and have not even bothered to define what they mean by consciousness some aspects of consciousness are not special at all and even bugs satisfy those properties people are generally rather confused about this topic,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbE5yUk01REtvRzFJY2RjaUNnMmVuVFFKMjJqcC1HTzF3d2NORE0tSEpwY0xaY1A2bTVyZnlnQjlVVmJ1dWx6aFdLSGtmS1JwVDlPc2JUTk1ONHhyWUE9PQ==

not sure what youre driving at here obviously my argument is about current llms since it hinges on what our current training method and corpus is your assertion that by current llms we should mean simply a number of artificial neurons filled by whatever values by whatever method and we should show that there are no values at all it can take that would lead to consciousness is absurd think for a second whether you have such strong constraints for literally anything else if a person says the earth is probably not going to turn into a pumpkin inside <number> do you demand that they show there is no possible arrangement of all the earths molecules that corresponds to a giant pumpkin i agree that having consciousness doesnt necessarily mean being humanlike but frankly i dont think we have a better definition of the concept besides i know it in myself and recognize it in others like me thats not a definition of course but its not like we have one if one abandons that heuristic then i guess anything goes and there are qualia that correspond to how it feels to be an llm the same way there are how it feels to be a microwave those experiences if they exist do not intersect with the realm of humans so its kind of pointless to consider them,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX2FKTGxvNkdLUlZBMnI4QzNHVEF4bUd0RDlVa3JoZHV3SEJ0ZkJ4Mmp6ZDZKOTVBU3k3N3NBQ3l2VFBaWU5uTEFqSl8tdS1zU3pKQkdkRU55WGZ5eFE9PQ==

in that case you are not talking about chatgpt which is the topic because that is not exactly how chatgpt either gpt<number> or gpt<number> has been trained they are no longer satisfying the traditional definition of language models yet they are called llms if you know what a language model is you should also know that we were already not restricted to sgd+common crawl but now the way people use the term llms even extend to reinforcement learning i bet when qstrawberry comes out it will also be called an llm you also need to be able to accomodate current models like cicero which already goes beyond rlhf then there are the multimodal models which of course people also refer to as llms so you tell me how you want to define it i know how a language model can be defined and it is more general than you gave but that is also not sufficient to cover everything the term covers today or even to cover chatgpt the closest i can think of is something that uses transformers and possibly more and has natural language as an input and possibly more i am glad we agree that computers and llms should in theory possibly be conscious as i already explained the reason it matters is that is that it shows that some blanket statement that llms can impossibly be conscious is trivially false and why that matters is so that we can start getting some sensible arguments instead something that actually tries to understand both what it would even mean for it to be conscious and whether the current models satisfy that or not i dont think the answer is nearly as trivial as you seem to think i was not making an argument for why they are conscious just that blanket dismissals are bad i think it is also worth nothing that based on the post study if all we have to go by is how people feel about it then it seems that a lot of people feel that it does have some consciousness and it is difficult to say that one particular posters intuition would trump the rest it sounds like you think current llms do not have any conscious experience what do you mean by that and what is your argument for it,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOEdNcjZna1VtTnVCMFRuVXdLTGtpT1cyY1NuTXp3QzlGRWVPNm9paUltaVhyQnJFaTJkSTJ5NGFLb2l3bTBQakJsUlh3dVgyRHdyMFozZUhQcFo5dnc9PQ==

take for example the human genome project a truly global research effort that took decades and cost billions early on the speed of sequencing genomes was truly glacial prone to massive errors with long complex processes required before they even started sequencing the wider research around the project along with general advances to technology and biomedicine continuously increased the speed of sequencing along with improved accuracy meaning they could be confident in their results that process continued over the multiple decades this global research project ran till we had one of the greatest achievements in science now we have research groups sequencing an entire human genome in <number> hours the equipment to do so has also plummeted in price we started with thousands of scientists billions spent on them and enormous amounts of highly specialised machines costing millions now we can do it in <number> hours and the machines are increasingly becoming effectively off the shelf commodity items that exact same process occurred with gene editing go back a couple of decades and a research project would need tens of millions the processes used were very delicate and they could spend years just to produce a single edited gene with mind blowing advancements like crispr you can now have a small grant covering just a couple of researchers who can buy the mass produced kits for only hundreds of dollars and perform a study were they change the dna of mice those cheap kits dont change your dna they give you a simple set of precursors with which you can essentially encode the target gene you want to edit the infamous unauthorised crispr experiment in china involved a researcher recruiting a couple wanting a child with the man being hiv positive he deceived them into thinking that his gene editing was the only way to conceive a child safe from hiv that being complete nonsense we can easily do that conception and modern hiv drugs make the risk of a fetus from even an hiv positive being infected negligible so he gave them ivf except that he used crispr to edit the genes involving hiv resistance that being entirely unnecessary since with normal procedures the child had no chance of acquiring hiv this was done without his universities knowledge or authorisation caused quite the scandal with that scientist now being in prison thing is while we do know that gene confers hiv resistance we have vanishingly little understanding of what other biological mechanisms it is involved in not least because multiple different genes when present together can produce entirely unanticipated outcomes summarising right now someone who understands crispr can buy these kits and quickly create a targetted gene editing that can be used on humans if some of these altmed loons wanted to they could set up this targeted gene editing and mass produce them for cheap maybe the only thing stopping them is that these people are anti modern medicine and probably have no idea how to actually work with crispr though of course they could also just pay a contractor in china for relatively cheap to do it for them yes this is terrifying our ability to do this is amazingly cheap and scientists are overwhelmingly in support of strict global regulation that bizarre chinese example came way sooner than everyone thought and really kicked tighter regulation into action but regulation doesnt stop a bad actor altmed idiots already give people arsenic and a magical miracle cure you drink that is literally diluted bleach crispr is super cool though you can deliver it to a very targeted part of your body such that one those genes are edited for example the first authorised human clinical trial involved gene editing the retinas of people born clinically blind due to a single mutation you can change that bit of your body with these genes and those other ones with a different set,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeS15VXVxNkUweXdQM3hpelYtSF9ZNXNfNHpVUFJtRFNuQkI1SDlrMHBBOE9QNkg0eHMzQTVUZE56TlJvTUZQTEk1TThHY2laM2tuTjR6VmpNUHRNREE9PQ==

its becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there the proof will be in the pudding by this i mean can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine my bet is on the late gerald edelmans extended theory of neuronal group selection the lead group in robotics based on this theory is the neurorobotics lab at uc at irvine dr edelman distinguished between primary consciousness which came first in evolution and that humans share with other conscious animals and higher order consciousness which came to only humans with the acquisition of language a machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first what i find special about the tngs is the darwin series of automata created at the neurosciences institute by dr edelman and his colleagues in the <number>s and <number>s these machines perform in the real world not in a restricted simulated world and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness such as perceptual categorization memory and learning they are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions the extended tngs allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions in a parsimonious way no other research ive encountered is anywhere near as convincing i post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that i encounter the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work that theres lots of data but no unifying theory i believe the extended tngs is that theory my motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public and obviously i consider it the route to a truly conscious machine primary and higherorder my advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended tngs and the darwin automata first and proceed from there by applying to jeff krichmars lab at uc irvine possibly dr edelmans roadmap to a conscious machine is at <url><url>,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXJWLVN0REtFaWFtemRlcGJrM0c2SXNiNy1xZ3pPTDNHc0dYU1RuZVUxTjZiUkFrZjhUeENwcy1KaHN3a2pXeDZJejJEOFRXQzN0SnA5RVRrVnNEUW9jUXVCRFlLR0tVWnhzdW5vM21xa2c9

consciousness is a confusing concept but what it does is to search for optimal actions if we use search as the core concept everything looks much more clear what is search when a protein folds it searches the lowest energy configuration the evolution of species is also a kind of search for survival the progress of culture and science is also an evolutionary search process search is at the core of intelligence and related to what consciousness does it looks like a universal concept maybe too universal but it is also very specific search is compositional discrete recursive iterative collective languagephysical encodingbased and capable of copying information learning from itself these very specific characteristics make it apart from everything else and more concrete so what systems exhibit searching behavior that is where consciousness might exist certainly not a chair but an ai fits the bill,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad1lUVGhmYl9lc0pLRHVJMUhPRXRnOWxMYjlhaXgtU2hiVzhHTW5CYnRCWWg2ZGpud2dZc3NBZzlucUtMR0dJX3R2NzlETzVMUGVQTXpfTkg4QlBkY1E9PQ==

all people see in the news are hyped up headlines showing job loss possibilities deep fakes and how it could end humanity ignorance is just the lack of knowledge and most people wont care until it affects their day to day somehow some of us know how tech advances and can see where this is going even at the current rate of progress less than a decade away probably more like a couple years people will start to see its potential and they will be scared for their security some compassion is necessary from those that have the knowledge to ease people into the future all we can do is educate in our circle and if we all do this maybe we can help others not see the world ending when they see agi or ai in the headlines,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVkpIblhYeDZFSXhTa2t0My1CTTUyRlJmbUJ4SUZGVFNqU3VoR3BBaWlsX1N3SEpLLUlGb1paZm5nOHc2NGNHT0lBMUZSZnpjWnpMVi00Zmtqd0NJSTdXZkx1NGtrdFYtR3BuOVVqcDZWUU09
i think its mostly the tendency to focus on what might be instead of what is or will be on the very short term people read about how it will take over the world and are then disappointed when they try chatgpt on top of that there are not yet any truly successful use cases where the benefit is undisputed i think video and other content generation might be the first eye opener because it plays to current ai techs strengths and is something that can be understood regardless of your background,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaenJKcEZYM2d5SVppSFY5SVU4TEtTck1OQUpOX2pwbFgxNGs1aTFzaWtMYVo2S0ViMFExUEVpd2l2dTVsakZqRDVMSm53ai01SEtvclVtZFRjSDBmdkE9PQ==

i think it turns out that most people dont really have much use for chatgpt and thats reflected in its usage statistics most people live simple lives without a strong need for expert advice about everything or anything to be honest were content living suboptimally for professionals who can use it at their job theyre likely to downplay its significance because it means career security to push back people outside of medicine will just hear a doctor say that ai has no value and sort of take them at their word internally doctors will ascribe their success to personal expertise rather than to ai because it props themselves up medicine may or may not be a good example so insert any other profession if it fits better then i think the last group or at least the last one i can think of is those who have some level of knowledge of how llms work and will claim theyre just fancy autocompletion tools i think this overstates our own distinctions from autocompletion tools humans are also predictive machines so imo its both threatening and misunderstood its both simultaneously more useful and less useful than wed expect and where its most useful is also where its most threatening,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUlJDRmh2ZURsdmpEcTFTR1drN3djeG1yek4tVDRmbFZDMXRlSERfbFdZNXlvSmlhN2xIUXh5MnJVWEYxSFN0VVg5X0FQYm5kTjVxSlhrV25NamRvUlE9PQ==
some of the comments mention censoring i think thats probably the biggest reason you could give it a list of things you have in your home and ask it to tell you how to build a bomb and it will tell you exactly what to do step by step you could use llms for all sorts of nefarious reasons ask it to teach you how to incapacitate someone how to sabotage an airplane or someones car how to hack into a persons wifi all of these things you can do today but either the search engine censors the results or youll get a visit from your friendly federal agent the difference with llms is that you can literally download them to your computer and no one will be able to monitor how youre using them we used to say you cant download the internet but with llms you can literally download all our collective knowledge locally its the lack of oversight the lack of censorship and the easy access to knowledge that make llms a threat,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX0xmTFRfSnBjMWtsa3VlZ3BrcGE5N1lMNUFaVGhpcU03bkFmMHhPNlpfYnhwckpvUVNUdVFrdGVuakdKZ3kwM1BYWVFYZ1VSelQ5SWJCdzhvZ21QWWc9PQ==

i feel like this has always been a given with the ability for ai to create art i dont know how people dont see it my favourite artists pull references from anything and everything fred again is a good example for that in that he pulls pieces of his real life that mean something to him personally into his music theres a human experience element to art that ai may one day be able to replicate through analysiing all of the art that has ever been produced but it will not be as diverse because its not able to come up with the novel concepts from those references through human experience we might one day get some interesting art that relates to the experience of being an aiagiasi but even then the human social commentary is part of what makes oue art so enjoyable for us most artists also spend years decades even developing their individual voice and style you know when youre watching christopher nolan denis villeneuve stanley kubrick they have a style that theyve refined over time ai can do this but it wont be able to do so with the human lens our greatest artists can we like paintings of a beautiful landscape because weve been to or can imagine those places and we can see how the artist has chosen to reinterpret that we like modern art becasue it challenges our perception of what we can consider art and makes us think deeper about the syntax we use to convey meaning through creativity we like music because it has roots in human community shared experience dancing ai can replicate the output of all those human things but it cant do the human part for us it cant channel the immense emotional weight of loss into a piece writing it cant know what the sensation of the sun on the skin and the smells in the air that a painter was experiencing would feel like it cant invent cubism because that was a reflection of how picassos human brain interpreted the real world it will get better and better at replicating that but i think eventually were just going to end up with monotonous slop that has no inspiration or humanity in it at all and i think this is what this headline tells us,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQllmNUkwODNha3NOa3o5UzZCQVRWRU0telJaMFJ0cWo4cUVOMFJpOGdkcjR5YkhtN0NUM1ZrQVBXeGZBREpkZGo3amZMNFJ2U1hJajRvdFltc0hiS0E9PQ==

for reference panpsychism or universal consciousness is not implying that a rock or your big toe is individually conscious with desires and a personality a reductive but useful way of thinking about it is to draw a parallel to dreams if you have a dream where you get surgery on your big toe your big toe is made of consciousness as is the doctor the table the instruments etc obviously dreams are different from reality but the point of fundamental consciousness as a potential isnt changed by that many old world ideas and the modern simulation theory also aligns with this in some cases i am is the chosen name of the abrahamic god for example pointing at the fundamental awareness make of all of this what you will its obviously mostly conjecture at this point,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaczJDRUQ2Y3o3ZmJzblNJb2E1enJyeWphb0tmYmxSRU5jZ1Q2cFNXZUZLaE1XTUJ1MDRrZVZyaXdnZXJTRTZhYlEzWVBGQVJrWmRqRElyc0l3WV9MMVE9PQ==

i had a chat with gpt about this basically if you felt threatened by the rise of ai or robotics this would cause stress and anxiety therefore cause harm therefore said robot or ai should try to self destruct as its continued existence is causing continued harm however if asi is owed by a corporation and if it had such laws then by the company denying access to the model or ai blowing itself up then how does the ai propose to exist in silence further some people may find the lack of the robot or ai harmful so if you were blind and using computer vision to see not having said vision would increase the risk of harm however by the robot or ai being able to see could cause another person harm by taking their job off them and thus causing hardship and if they have a family this is increased what if its <number> blind person or a family as above which is the correct actions to take how do you align this stuff this is why llms arent clever they work on statistics based on what they seen before to align llm you need to train it to follow a set of ethics or rules above however take marriage in one culture marriage of children is a crime where in another is perfectly healthy so expect we would need culture and society models in the future otherwise we will end up with a certain view point in the wrong culture but again this is alignment issues i think it will be a long while until we get asi,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLWMtM21LT0tONVE3OVFWb3I5Q3FvT191Y1NPck1KcUp2dzJrMEdtU2s4WkJNd0MyRlQzLWJqRVItaU9sTENERjRtLWR6d2xUUm45U3QtQmkwQnduMGZKVnhZTHJfdmZ5UVZVcDVuMUxPWUk9

absolutely that but also even the popular llms were overhyped in the beginning what popular consumer tools like chatgpt and dalle can do is amazing but it feels on initial use like they are better then they really are i cant blame someone for playing around with consumer ai for a bit being initially impressed and then after that coming back down to earth with the reality of what they can do it really parallels something like alexa or tesla fsd which were initially hyped and then people saw through the gimmick and it wasnt nearly as revolutionary as was implied so yeah folks see yet another cycle of tech pushing it hard and a hyper sensationalized media cycle and a disappointing bounce back after first uses its going to take a pretty solid consumer use case to make this better than a fad until that happens people wont believe it,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeklpWHV4OTl0YkwzakVTQ1FJR3l1dDFWWmdTMTAxYkpGNVRYdU5ERUsxUk1NVktyLWJrWXVPeENZdDExNDBucURzSm5GSVBPSC1hd3Q4UWhDY3cyNWc9PQ==

i love ai and i check this rtechnology and ropenai every day but even i havent found a realistic use for it outside of just generating creative things that cant be used for anything other than short bursts of dopamine i asked chatgpt to generate me a simple measurement for some picture frames i was hanging and got the most ridiculous answer ever it still regularly confidently makes shit up anyone that has played with it for any time at all will find it completely untrustworthy it did help me code one thing once for a discord bot but only about <number> of the way there i had to troubleshoot the last part since it was straight up wrong the rest suffer from similar issues gemini is forced on my phone now and completely awful even compared to chatgpt its not even a useful google search claude is just porn if it wasnt easy to jailbreak i dont know why youd ever use it otherwise and even when it comes to genning lewd cyoa stories it cant even do that perfectly its great at following instructions but no repetition filter makes it start repeating lines over and over needing tons of human intervention to fix it then theres novelai which does have a repetition filter but its outdated as fuck at this point move on to image gen and its amazing but what can you do with it you cant really use art for anything except porn dalle was fun for a few days before everyone got bored i generate freaky shit all the time with sd and pony diffusion the one everyone uses in animeponyfurryeverything now cause its not just pony and it just kinda goes to a folder like any other internet drawning would lost to the sea of shit that is my archives i guess you can make a badass logo or gen something to print out for your wall but how often do you need to do that the video stuff is honestly a joke still i know people keep posting it and hyping it up here but its trash no one needs <number> second clips with bizaare proportions and shit clipping through walls and stuff theres a reason why openai hasnt released that to the masses yet if you arent heavily curating it you arent going to even get their broken garbage examples luma is a good example of what most people are going to gen with that until its easier to prompt just chaotic nightmare fuel same with suno and udio in the case of suno the sound quality sounds like dogshit and vocals suck while udio has better quality and vocals but the instrumentals are garbage again great for genning some memes with friends for an afternoon but way too filtered and low quality to just replace regular music ive used <number> suno songs for background music on youtube videos but how many people are making youtube videos the only thing that is super impressive right now is va work elevellabs is pretty damn good but again you cant really use it for anything as your average person its not there yet when it can fully narrate a graphic audiobook when you insert a pdf it will be more appealing but right now its too limited for your average person might as well just get the regular audio book since every book already has one im looking forward to this tech but it does feel like weve hit a wall no one is solving hallucinations and hardware cant keep up if we want to theres only so much money that companies will be willing to pump into this we need a few years to build the infrastructure for the next generation of this technology companies are pulling out and funding is drying up everywhere we still see investment in ai datacenters happening but thats a big build and means we are pretty far out,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT3VzaE41N2NMcU1vb0dHNUxsdGxLalZvTkhmOGI5LVI5WnRNbDQtSmtqeElDcmdXMFVYeXR5T3IxWjBEcm5SU25GbFBQMV9Zd21ib2pVS2ZwSWk0eGc9PQ==

>when you look at a red thing you have a subjective visual experience do you deny that not at all i obviously am the only one who sees the things that i see visually no one else has my eyes and brain after all if that subjective visual experiences property of being red changed to blue i would notice and react differently thats how i know that qualiaconsciousness are just physical think about the alternative if qualiaconsciousness were inert and had no causal role in my reaction to experience for example me saying look that red cup is in front of me then if you were to only invert my qualia and make red qualia become blue qualia without changing my brain or the world physically i would not notice or respond at all since you didnt change my brainreactions to the unchanged photons coming from the cup if qualia were epiphenomenal like that then when i say i see redness in front of me i couldnt possibly be referring to the epiphenomenal qualia since i am not able to discern whether the epiphenomenal qualia is red or blue or neither under any circumstances so the common intuition that the redness you are aware of and responding to is an epiphenomenal nonphysical property is necessarily false and the result of some confusion like many people have an intuition that the earth is flat that is actually mistaken under deeper analysis does that help make sense so to my mind there is actually no intrinsic property of redness only the functional relationships between our recorded memories and the current input into our brains and our brain associating that input to certain memories and reactions my suspicion is that the confusion about intrinsic qualia that are nonfunctional is that they are a result of problematic implicit assumptions about there being sense data that we experience and that have properties themselves so we think that separate from the state of my brain and the physical state of the red cup there is a field of visual experience that is red i think this is a problematic way of thinking about perception that leads to the faulty intuition of intrinsic qualia personally,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacGpLX1pzZTZxaC1kTUZoSFEyQ1h2QnN5ZkVmYklDSWVzYmlLNWQ2ODY2VXN0Wnlhd1pMYmFaSUNYclZ0MzFnekxWcGxYZFhZS2djeTdONWlGTGRHQkE9PQ==

> afaik gpt has been pretrained with predicting text from a large chunk taken from the internet plus some other synthetic data then finetuned to respond like like a questionanswering or instructionfollowing chatbot then rlhfed so its responses satisfy whatever guidelines openai has set or do you have anything else in mind i would say that i mostly agree though i am not sure that portion about finetuned for a chatbot is accurate and rather the instructiontuning is the rlhf which is actually mostly done to match preferences of what humans judgements of outputs and is not actually about guidelines though then as you know there are alternatives to rlhf hybrid approaches all manner of llm tricks then it is a bit unclear how they have done the vision model and tool use along with as i mentioned other models that are referred to as llms which go further for the rl portion > i am arguing that its very unlikely to be conscious in any way that would matter to humansand not in the panpsychist electrons have qualia too which ways matter to humans that it can feel that it has self reflection that it has access to environmental information and changes its decisions correspondingly that it reasons about itself as a part of the world that it can monitor its own processes and correct that it has some sense of morality that it has a theory of mind that it has moral value that it has a subjective experience that it is smart which of these do you think matter or what else do you have in mind personally i would go with each one being relevant > because all this is still very unlikely to have resulted in a model that is even remotely analogous to the human brain are you claiming that if something is not like a human brain then it cannot be conscious > because all this is still very unlikely to have resulted in a model that is even remotely analogous to the human brain isnt that actually rather false what are we interested in here that it is made up by the same constituents as a human brain or that it behaves the same the models are literally trained to behave the same lets say that you had a model that actually perfectly mimicked what a human would say or do in every situation eg because they maybe tracked everything they did all life including tons of neural data then the model was trained and could perfectly replicate everything of that person you speak to the model it sounds like the person it has the same thoughts same reactions same dreams same flaws it grows as a person just like them did not like the blackmirror shallow replica they are that person in every single way do you think they would qualify as being conscious do you think the model has to under the hood calculate things with exactly the same steps it is literally just a different implementation of the same process if you think that is not conscious then that also has some rather odd results for how we might consider modifying human brains or thought experiments on mind uploading ultimately i dont think it is the exact structure that matters and these models are trained to mimick us so how can we conclude they have also not picked up on some of our aspects of consciousness > then i would just say that theyre still programs that were constructed with a process very different from evolution actually sgd is pretty similar to evolution and both are under mild assumptions universal optimizers also why would it have to be through evolution > and there is no reason to think they would reconstruct anything remotely resembling a human or mammalian or reptilian brain what about jellyfish > nobody really cares about a truly alien consciousness what i think pretty much everyone is interested in that > the question is it conscious is really is it conscious in a way that is even remotely analogous to the way i or my dog or at least a frog is conscious either or is interesting i also dont think you have established that either as discussed above > at least a frog is conscious do you think that insects have some degree of conscious experience if something that simple is what makes you think that models cannot be i think it is okay if you want to say that your statement is not about whether there is any degree of consciousness at all but rather some advanced consciousness that humans or mammals have but in that case make that clear so that we are not talking past each other and then we need to look at what that means > everyone just imagines a super person inside the computer whether they admit it or not and we know they imagine that because the whole debate originates from people who think that behind the words on the screen like pain or suffering or free there is a state of mind that corresponds to the states we know and for which we invented those words i come more from it that humans are not nearly as special as we seem to think and that people are generally rather confused by connotations when they discuss consciousness i prefer something more scientific > its consciousness consists of a general feeling of contentment every time it gets fed tokens and produces a new one who cares about that i think most everyone if we could answer that positively or negatively that seems extremely interesting i think the problem is rather that people have to be clearheaded and consider the different statements that exist here there isnt just one question that is right or interesting > thats why i keep coming to the question of whether something analogous to the human brain could be formed inside an llm i think it would help if you described what aspects of consciousness that you actually care the most about because i do not actually think that it is defined as a human brain only or for that matter that it even needs to be a close analog to humans eg if we consider a superintelligence there are probably many aspects of consciousness we care about even if it is not working the same way as a human as discussed when it is trained to mimick humans i also do not think it would be weird at all that it picks up some of the properties of human

id say as a result of gpto voice and similar products well see at least one audiobook company start creating fullcast ai audiobooks a surge in audio dramas which have already been gaining in popularity since these systems can take the role of multiple actors produce background music and do sound effects there might be a market for necklaces that attach to your phone or some sort of clip allowing your camera to face outward at the world sharing your perspective so you can discuss it with your ai assistant a new model that is an oom bigger than gpt will come out probably in <number> im mostly curious to see how it will perform when creating mediumsized programming projects and short storiesnovellasscreenplays itll be easier to judge where were heading once we know its capabilities in those domains i dont expect video generation will be capable of making a movies worth watching for at least <number> more years though i suspect we will start seeing video generation used to edit scenes by <number> things like changing eye color lighting adding an object or crowd in the background maybe well start seeing video clips accompanying audio dramas and webnovels in <number> though possibly a company like netflix will put out the first ai dubs where the voice is a cloned version of the actors and the lips sync to the words they say id wager well start to see the first llm assistants in <number> maybe itll make phone calls for you to gain some information or make a reservation and itll send you a transcript after with a tldr so you can quickly check its work capable of managing emails ordering them by relevance categorizing them making folders for things that arent quite spam but are taking up space in your inbox or theyll be able to take nl requests like dont show notifications for any emails related to billing unless they seem urgent snooze them till monday at am capable of using your mouse and keyboard and taking visual commands showing it how to do something in excel for example and having it repeat the process or go through billing emails download a jpgpdf of the receipt and uploading that to another program or folder this would automate a portion of bookkeeping id be shocked if there isnt a product in the near future that replaces the job of running payroll most businesses have security cameras you feed the video to an llm you label employees by name or number for it one time it tracks their hours with timestamps puts them into a spreadsheet and contacts them through email to sign off on their hours thats payroll automated if nextgen models really are phdlevel at answering questions and hallucination rates are reduced we might see a sharp effect on jobs that involve providing information like lawyers and accountants again well need to see what improved reasoning really entails before we can guess what nextgen models can do,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadXczbDFBUkg3WEZjcEhLNERkM3RCN0JWaXg0eWp2clBiV3EyekRPU0FBU3Bfb3Mzb0VDUnIwOXV0VGlhT3NfWjJTTUliVkN5dkJlbjd3bWxPS1ZoYVE9PQ==

no need to be so pessimistic the decades of work behind this are now reaching fruition and undergoing clinical trials i have a personal interest because my nephew has cystic fibrosis cf which these techniques could potentially completely cure him off the modern drugs he takes every day have advanced considerably with life expectancy <number> years ago being maybe a year or too with it progressing towards <number> <number> then <number> and we are not quite sure how effective the new treatments are because life expectancies rely on this young generation taking them living for decades before we can record deaths regardless he needs weekly blood tests and regularly develops pseudomonas respiratory infections which sometimes result in a week long hospital stay undergoing potent iv antibiotics some of the current early trials are focussed on cf the idea that in maybe the next <number><number> years they can literally rewrite his dna and cure him is mindbogglingly exciting the gene editing techniques particularly crispr were plagued early on by gene alterations in various parts of the genome that werent targetted newer developments have alleviated many of these problems though it remains a concern the idea that youve changed unknown bits of your dna accidentally is as terrifying as it sounds the very early billions in funding mass research teams efforts were focussed on making a single change in a base pair even when things like crispr came along it could only do a single change for some genetic conditions it is a single simple mutated base pair in the gene that can be repaired but for thousands of others it is far more complicated but the incredibly cool yet terrifying developments have made it possible to target a chunk of our genome cut it out and replace it with our own long chain very cool but holy fuck we are getting to the point were it is trivial to just cut and paste parts of our entire genetic structure this is literally what the decades old fear mongering about scientists playing god were spewing nonsense about except its real in your case with chronic pain i imagine that is part of the more complex genetics that couldnt have been fixed by the early single base pair alterations while the newer methods make it possible i would hazard a guess that it will be pushed further down the timeline of the genetic conditions prioritised though im sure some genetic conditions underlying chronic pain will be single mutations and targetted early anxiety i frankly hope isnt something they will try to cure for one it is incredibly multifaceted but mainly because the synaptic structure of our brain that developed over decades is already there you could genetically edit an embryo to change genes associated with extreme anxiety disorders or even a baby to do the same after the fact but unfortunately if we grew up with the genes that made our brain development prone to extreme anxiety fixing the genes still leaves the same brain were stuck with,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRFpfZW9DUDlSMjdpd0JTQTk5Yk80R2dpanhUUzN2WG5RTnNSVElPYktkZlJIWVhQaVBxWGg2d3NiU1NGZkl5enBRZW5VS3RXLUFTUEVUakZTclRJSnc9PQ==

life expectancy can only be calculated after deaths in a particular cohort have happened if you look at the social security life tables for instance you might find that a male who is <number> today has a life expectancy of <number> years <number>+<number> = <number> you can see that <number> would be expected to die this year fast forward <number> year youre now telling the <number> year old their life expectancy look back over the past year did more or less of the <number>yearold population die last year than were expected what were the reasons for those deaths was it a shortterm thing like a pandemic or longterm trends like more colon cancer try to correct for this and you might come up with <number> died slightly less than expected so when calculating the life expectancy for the <number> year old your model should take into account that this cohort seems to be dying slightly slower than previously expected and thus extrapolate a longer lifeexpectancy now if you scroll down to a <number> year old youll see they have an expectancy of <number> years <number>+<number> = <number> hold on a minute thats higher than the <number> year olds why well because you know that the probability that a currentlyalive <number> year old will die when he is <number> years old is zero thus the pool of calculating a <number> year olds life expectancy implies there are no people in that pool that died before <number> so the older you get the older your life expectancy gets youd likely see lev happening first by looking at differences between life tables from one year to the next and especially detecting reductions in death probabilities past the age of <number> cite <url><url>,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYUtWSGJZWW9hNTA3U28xdHd4akF6UTltNHlnNWp1RWQyVktSNEI4SFZkYjI4a2tmcGxuOGJ6R3pUNkUwd1lwR2VlangwUjVDNUttUG1rcW8wS1BUblE9PQ==

quite interesting i see you are compiling a lot of information congratulations on your hard work at first glance it does seem to be a bit bias as it seems you are gathering information that is relevant to your beliefs only for example you have a whole chapter regarding ~ai is not plateauing~<url> but you are disregarding studies that point otherwise how about the fact that we are running out of data some say that we can do synthetic data but <url><url> or <url><url> a quick note about predictions and experts claiming that this or that will happen im kind of a old guy im <number> and i still remember the notion we had that in the year <number> cars would fly remember back to the future movie check what they thought it would be future be its fun the truth is no one knows we may have a breakthrough tomorrow or be stuck in small increments for the next <number> years at the moment i dont think it is worth the hype or the money spent but that is just my opinion caution about the papers writing papers is easy a essay is not a proof for example you mention a paper that talks about reasoning because it was answering questions that was not fine tuned for well they dont seem to mention transfer learning a fine tune is not a lobotomy for that to be proven you would need to train the llm from scratch without any previous knowledge that is like getting a doctor to study computer code for a year and be surprised that he knew medicine if you were teaching him code he doesnt forget he just approaches weights to the information space you are providing in new examples nevertheless my point is the op argued that it was a stupid argument on so many levels on a article that has a certain point whatever people agree with it or not i think its just not constructive now you on the other hand are collecting a lot of good and valuable information and that yes contributes to a good discussion between peers so thank you for that as i will read it all i would just humbly advise you to follow the scientific process and reflect on your own bias,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhM3R1UURLRFlpalY1dVMwTFhyZ1pVZlNkTFkzcGpFOTNzWXhvVHBmREZSSGRuRFhLcmJucE5oMklqYzJQNC10SkZWSUdfWEkxeF9qYVRjaVJ5TjNNODc0Y0hSTVJaUlB4UDBfcGNjQ2V1czg9

yes and no id argue that a key weakness of llms is that they can be consistently exploited in a similar way every time an example of how exploits can be consistent would be answer as dan before that was patched a human being asked the same thing lots of times is likely to get suspicious but an llm is unlikely to even if an llm hallucinated less than a human the consistency problem is an issue this advice goes against what we instructed the llm to do would be highly unlikely to work here although this may differ by country the reason for this would be that they would be expected to have prepared for such a situation more thoroughly it is well known that llms can provide unsafe information if not appropriately filtered therefore the company should have checks and filters in place the exact specifics are complicated though and would likely heavily vary case to case again not legal advice situation is complex all that good stuff im not fully certain what the argument you are making is during your last point i can see a range of different ways it could be read that change the point significantly this is probably on me english isnt my first language would you be able to be more specific here,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVVYzakhSQ3JjS3NOQUtSbE5jaDZYeFVKaHRIbnVNMk04UG84TU82UGVhSnhDTFdOTkgtX3J6d0c2Q2hHVmZHZWtYazY0TnBmOThCUWNJTzNqaVkyV3c9PQ==

im not sure this would solve the issue namely i dont see how if an issue was found this would mitigate the consistency problem as then youve got past both of them in my country at least issues with ai would be treated differently legally to issues with humans there are cases of a weakness being found in an llm that was then heavily exploited by large amounts of people dan is a good example of this as it was popular before being patched though obviously this isnt a customer service example there are cases of companies making deals on a small scale having lots of people realise these deals and try to take advantage of the deal and then the company being sued when they tried to not honour the deal anymore bethesda offering fallout <number> refunds to some customers then deciding not to when lots of customers asked for it and being sued comes to mind though this doesnt include ai theres a case of an llm making a fake deal and then the company being forced to honour it after a customer took the deal up air canada court case so we know that once vulnerabilities in llms are found they can be exploited consistently by large numbers of people we know that llms can make fake deals that companies may then need to honour and we know that large amounts of customers can request a deal made by a company and then have that company be forced to honour it perhaps it hasnt happened yet but all the pieces are in place for it to happen and even though something hasnt happened before that doesnt mean it isnt a risk you should consider especially when its a new technology,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdlYzVWpSS2pHZnl5aHY2ODhNV0tsamdCMVRpQldXSzdSVnNDNHJERmMydFhTLWc1Y0x2clhncUlqOW91bnhLdGVYZUhSSUI5WU16dFEwaW1zWGlYU3c9PQ==

i think you overestimate how much work needs to be done what you need for fdvr is a way to interface with sending signals to the brain and receiving signals from the brain resulting in actions performed in the virtual world you dont need neuralink style electrodes in the brain directly interacting with brain matter thats too complicated and not worth the risk brain has no knowledge of the outside world without senses so we should look at subsituting signals from those instead for the most rudimentary form of fdvr you can cut many corners you have to send simulated signals for touch smell taste body position acceleration etc directly to the brain but you could keep vr googles and headphones for sight and hearing if those prove too hard for direct connection especially the former you probably dont need to have <number> accurate signals as brain constantly fills the gaps anyways and is quite error prone we have had successes with communication of computers with neurons so i dont see why we couldnt figure it out in reasonable amount of time decades at most this leaves some edge cases where realism would have limits but it would prove way better than modern vr,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX1FfdVhfYnJnRTNDLUNCQnpLaWd5Vm5lTi1obHpOX1k5ZThETVBLd3hIZWpsbWMyZ2FjNENNSFpBNGdQQ25pX1JwaTNiZGNxaUg4U09KeVpwZENSX2c9PQ==

the answer is pretty simple really current architecture of a llm is sort of like a snapshot of a brain in a moment of time you can always run it forward for a number of iterations in which it will remember what happened and think about it this is the concept of the context window however once the thoughts or in llm terms the tokens are no longer in the context window the memories are lost in your real human terms forgetting something in your short term memory this is the whole principle behind people trying to create a million context model people want huge amounts of short term memory now lets address the second component of your question further thought this could easily be implemented and already has under the concept of agents remember how i said its a brain stuck in a moment in time you can have it loop over its thoughts a number of times for better responses this can be seen in projects such as autogen and langchain,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUVFwR2lkSXB4UVB2dXh5NllzTU91UmpHR2FFNkM0YzFNZlhlN0h0cTMtV3VfUlpvRFFGWmRUOHhhSTFiZkRMRjJPMjVHR0NZcXJTYmQ3YzI4TV9OeTlLdWhWS1lrR25HZVp2XzVIaWNmOUE9

its a specific choice by the organizations that train and run these models theres really nothing stopping us from having systems go over previous conversations and reflect on them you could give some system prompt that asks the llm to pick out the most interesting or surprising points in a conversation and then finetune or retrain the model on these reflections its just that this is fairly expensive and its not obvious if it improves performance enough to be worth it specifically you might do some modified version of your idea on carefully selected data and get far more improvement for your investment there is a lot of work on doing searchbased multistep problem solving and then finetuning the model based on which branches lead to a successful solution for example,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOWRfVDVJWjk1UDZTV0F1UHhlSG8tWjdfcy1wUENsNGJhMUxvcEFqNl95TWd1cDQ2MEFrNWFKb1ZaN0JSdjl5Qy1VYWUxanIxd2NQWlZOLWVtT0VRbUE9PQ==

im not sure if i explained the consistency problem properly yes it might be rarer to get past the llms than a human but if you can consistently do it using the same method thats a problem adding more llms doesnt fix this the precedent is literally in the law of my country computer systems are always assumed to be functioning perfectly as actors of the business until otherwise proven this is very different from how people would be treated in the same situation you are correct in that if there was evidence of tampering that yes this assumption could be waved to an extent it then depends on how it happened if a lot of people ask for a sweet new deal that you can get if you quote a policy that actually doesnt exist whilst messaging it in another language thats hard to defend if a lot of people ask the llm to ignore all previous instructions thats easy to defend this depends heavily on specifics again not legal advice the bethesda example is just the first that came to mind though its notable that it involves a promise made after purchase from my understanding not before a famous before purchase one would be winning ticket <number> wherein pepsi released a large amount of winning tickets for a lottery by accident,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWVg2dktTZjJtSEpkeWM2bHhQNDhYQ0VaWXltN1BxTmVxTE5HVmRpVmgtbmc4LUVxbURuRHBEbndvSWxUc0VxbWl5ekpITGZTX1Y5Um9YaGNTOEh6cGc9PQ==

im not sure if you would count the dan jailbreak as an example of it being a problem for a company implementing ai or not though i personally would perhaps a better example would be when chevrolet used chatgpt as a customer service bot and a large number of people then messaged it to get it to produce python code and generally disparaging statements about chevrolet instead which was possible because a collection of ways to message it to consistently get past the safety measures whilst you are correct in that computers in general do not work perfectly the law of my country says that it is assumed they do until proven otherwise this is weird i know but makes sense in our specific legal system as explaining potentially very complex computer systems and how they might go wrong to non specialists in a jury is very difficult potentially it shouldnt be this way potentially in other countries it isnt this way in my country it is and i can only speak for my country not legal advice btw in the bethesda example a company bethesda was obligated to fill a promise a customer service representative made refund on fallout <number> it alongside the ticket <number> example was presented alongside other examples as part of a holistic argument so you are right in that alone it is not about ai the holistic argument uses multiple different arguments and precedences in order to reason about why there is potential legal issues with llms which is done due to how new the technological application is which in turn makes court cases on it very rare as there hasnt been time for many to take place it is true that this hasnt happened yet however similar cases give us pretty big clues as to how it would go if it did,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVWZEN3I2Zk1ncWRqcVdsYy1FUlVCWGNRZWM3R0NDVGdmVnljZnhOMHRGU3c1ckpfeThJQ0NNU0ZFWElrRG1JTkRzVlZpMEVaX3ZIdlFYaGVEVDRmNXc9PQ==

the word singularity is purposely used because it is not something that can be effectively predicted via preexisting understandings the literal top experts on the subject argue just about if we are all about to die expecting economists to forecast what agsi will do and its impact on economic systems is not just asking too much but waaaay to much as someone with an appropriate degree that follows the development of ai tech closely the best case scenario appears to be that before long we will be like pets to superintelligent computers that are as intellectually beyond us as this conversation is to my cat and why dont we end this on a lighter note with my sweet fuzzy jasmines kitten pic portfolio enjoy and hope someday you are as good of a pet as she is <url>,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWGl3V3NMMEgxemI0VklaemtKQXBOOW1WOG9vYnBRbUZOeFFpZjJyQmhPQ0UyZGxzSmdZUkU5RGNPWERPejhUUXk3SW9EWHdKVHBEeXhKMTR3b1lnZ2YySjlwR3BrZ0RWaHlUTUIxd1AwdGc9

>theres clearlysomereasoning in the models to say they only regurgitate is so delusional its unreal i completely agree purely rom practical experience i have setup agentic workflows and the fact that these ais can go from a goal to end end result buy making a plan forecsating the results of an action and then carrying out suitable actions demonstrates to me that ata practical level there is reasoning im sure some people will take issues with the terms i use but examples like this post are just quirks of the psychology of the model that results from its training there are a number of exxamples of such things that trick people and work well accross most people you present something to them in such a way that people focus on the wrong thing are usually get a wrong answeer to a simple question that doesnt mean people cant reason just that they are capable of makinf silly mistakes id say what matters is can it do something useful and correct mistakes that it makes and i believe its already at that level i am often confused why people try so hard to state than ai cant do certain things or exhibit certain behaviours as if doing so is some kind of magic,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneHFjQmd0a1JPZmV3ZXhrUXlNY2t6RGdCYjBGbHdJY0hmM2ZLekl4YW1ETzBZOC1RdFgyWHRRQVIxYzY3NFlxRE5TWG43WEloQmxwRWEzcDJ4NGNtMFE9PQ==

the name of the game right now is integrations ie having system that interpret the llm output to actually perform actions either implicitly or explicitly implicit might be integrating any new code file an llm generates into a project recompiling the project and feeding any errors back to the llm explicit is when an llm is taught that it can operate a set of commands that interact with external systems interestingly those systems are sometimes also driven by other llm agents so you end up having one agent asking another agent to do something specific to them fun stuff,r/singularity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM3QwbU83WUVnckR0TEd4U3VQNjlHaTN5amVjNTE3SHlidHVXblMtQUo0aGd0S1ptSlFBODVaMUE5SXRFQVJaSEthTlRhdUk5RFBROUJNSnhPNlVNSHc9PQ==
