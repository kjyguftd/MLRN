as with anything it depends if you are one year unaccompanied then you will probably live on base unless there is no room the amount of room on base has a lot to do with your rank for example there is probably less cgo dorm space than nco dorm space you can apply for command sponsorship which allows you to bring your car live off base have a place for kids in school etc iif you go this route you are signing up for two years minimum unaccompanied or accompanied you can also kaip which provides a financial incentive to stay an extra year in accompanied or unaccompanied but kaiping by itself wont allow for you to live off base my understanding is that spaceforkorea has some command sponsor billets so i would reach out to them soonest to secure one of those this is the only guaranteed way to bring your family and live off base there are apartments on base but those are normally in high demand for families who have kids in school and want easy access to on base school facilities if you are command sponsored want to live off base that should be relatively easy if you kaip you can stay an extra year as accompanied or unaccompanied,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbmVwYl9HcWJhbURieXpQUWRnNDhzdFJIc1J0cmxGaV9uc2VJcXdnWmp0b1Y3UTR3UzFpTHBCSkR1bDNyd1NKSlJoUVBpNnB3N1pMb2lCZG9uR3pneXhaRlR4akdOODB2THJfMFJlNTZjdjQ9

i see where the op is stating they dont necessarily want to talk to anyone they just want the meds i very recently dealt with some frustrations with the mental health situation i tried to do things the right way since in the past couple of years ive seen an increase in encouragement for using mental health resources however the process was the biggest pain in the ass here are the steps i took the long route <number> walked into mh office they asked the mandatory questions i responded no to all of them they told me to kick rocks and talk to bhop since i wasnt planning to hurt myself or others <number> called to schedule appointment had to wait months before being seen <number> went to bhop appointment dude told me to practice my breathing during times of stress yesbreathing <number> came back about <number> months later for the follow up appointment where i explained the breathing was a waste of my time then he hold me to find other ways to relieve stress such as exercising ive always gone to the gym nearly everyday so its not like that was gonna suddenly fix me <number> called milonesource to find a therapist in the area i had my appointment with the therapist later that month it was super helpful actually doc said he recommends medication and would start the referral process perfect <number> called the med group a week later to see what the deal was they explained it doesnt work like that milonesource cannot refer meds fml <number> scheduled appointment with my pcm and explained what steps id taken up to this point and explained i just want some medication he immediately said i can get you on some meds do you have a particular drug in mind wtf i went through all these hoops just to realize i just had to ask my doc for meds its likely he was only so ready to prescribe meds because i exhausted the other resources however he didnt even ask about the other steps just said yepp i got you lets get you on sertraline zoloft all that to say i got my meds now been on em for about a month now best thing ever i feel so normal so level headed shoot me a message if you want any details disclaimer meds wont fix everything it often takes people a while to find the perfect dose of the right drug definitely take that step to talk to someone in confidence like the milonesource recommended therapists the doc i spoke with was a civilian in the local area not connected to the military at all i never even met him just spoke over the phone to help me organize my thoughts as a skeptic i was surprised how helpful it was take that step first to figure out ways to straighten out the chaos in your head before reaching for meds,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYlZFUk1pdHdZZ2syck12YnJDY0FhOWpEd3lFenlZeDFTVXlDaWhTcnJRdkJNcnlWZVU4Q20zcXpWdk9SZXhwTGFZNjVEUnNBMXl2dnpJS01ndEhGeENnX2ZUV251a3RiaV9OcElZTVo5Umc9

not ssc but often times the military is asking for advanced capabilities and with space in particular these are usually one offs or very low production quantities its very difficult to determine how long it will take and how much it will cost to develop these new capabilities as a former ad now reservist with experience working for a defense contractor id really like to see more opportunities for our acquisition corps to be able to work with industry and learn how things work on the other side this will help them write better requests for proposals requirements contracts etc as well as help them scrutinize proposals from the contractors to make sure they are realistic,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMElzWExDR3lPOGpCWWRYVVZ6MmszT3B6WFN3RjJ3QzlVRDE0RENXYmVQcXdtNFVmQUxVTDRHbmxOb3F6Q2JlNzdDdDBxRDhENDc5LWJwNTk1RURLOHc9PQ==

this seems like an enlisted vs officer question not a space force question having a degree is the minimum requirement to be an officer there are a lot more different factors to take into consideration to be competitive to become an officer some people dont want to be an officer even if they have a degree different jobsresponsibilities when it comes to what an enlisted member vs what an officer does,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRHd3LThadjhiLWtnLTlWZkwzRDQwRzdQa084UnpsdmpJeEJ4Yml2QTIwSjJlZFZ3a0lUc3B4bWpyT1lIa3NQUTA4ZklFX0cxdHdjMENHQWdTYV9oLVE9PQ==
being an officer has vastly different training responsibility and roles its not as simple as officer make more money people blindly pushing people that have no interest in being leaders to be officers is how we have bad leaders in the military one way at least if you have a desire to lead and manage resources then go for officer if you dont qualify to be an officer or want to do more handson tasks rather than leadership the consider being enlisted,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdFF1czRLZkhxa2liWVBWandta1BkdGxnWXBLb2JCWDhOTGVtajZmRFRHSGF5SzV3YWdNVkVlYVhRUmtsS1RjZVpJc0hkeXpJaHhGejB1Vkc5cndoQnc9PQ==

hard stressful fulfilling not easy to get into as a civilian <number><number> ops on most missions for duty locations assume colorado jobs on the civilian sector would be spacedefense contractors expect to need bachelors to make it into a proper career,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTjZqV2pfS2NlQkFEcjhDYTdCaU9GMGVnbVI4Q0xzaEdpXzdMOFpIQndLQVNNTWlTbHV0b0YzdUQwQTYyTFI5X2UzWnc4M2pQdXBFWWg3NkFicl9nQVE9PQ==

the job is super easy and not stressful youll spend most of your time doing stuff thats not your job which is a great time to take classes duty stations are basically anywhere with large antennas colorado as always being a large pull a few bases around the world civilian side it opens up the same job but with better pay and hours outside of a select few jobs or door kicking anything in the space force is better than the army,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMkRGb3Y3dWRrSjQ3c3BuNGFhM3l6U0tNQlQ1djFGengzaFhTWG9fVzFIWXl0blhVVjAtYXNZUWZSNkxmT3h0RklfWWFhRTM0T3lRc1pOWUpWUUZaaVE9PQ==
dont go into the army if you want to be treated like an adult sure you can commission and stay far away from marijuana,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUEdqbW43MGRyOVNEMEVnZ2oxYkc2M1YyQWV5MUpRY01Cb0gtdDFjc0RkcXZuQUJZcFNEd2lsb0pKaUxDeG9ZZmtKanlyWks2M0kxTEViZkNISWFycHc9PQ==
you can go through the process of enlistment and wait in the delayed entry program dep for a space force job people who are in the dep for longer are prioritized for jobs when they become available therefore going through the process at october would most likely cause you to wait much longer to leave for the space force,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNFNRbS13akd5dUFyZjhnbGIwU3NjdThFNmZLZFNYOGpwTVhSRTNUWFdNRkdOMU9vbWQ1c1lpbHdFVU0wSERaaFhLaGFjd0ctbV9rQ1RhQ1Q2R3U2cDVnZlZOQUpXeDB0VzFqR0ZYc0pEQWM9
okay that leads to me to next question why would my recruiter tell me to wait and pick up the process in october,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnU1V3VjlBXzgtTENBTmJza0tYTTN2ZTM5MXZSNUFqSVd3Y21QY2VUOGh5U0psVjFXaENGcFBtRTM3NXhqTTJucmVmOHBsZ21oNjNTcjYycXNrRUlLRl9LcmhZRUVuVDJYT3RyOVVzRnpxRGs9
hello i have just been given the news within the past week that i have been accepted into the ussf and have been given the job space system operations and ill be shipping out in a little over a month i was a little disappointed at first as i really wanted to do something within the cyber field but as far as i can gather space systems seems pretty expansive and neat in its own right i read through the air forces reddit wiki thing on cx sx as well as some other sources i wanted to ask if anyone has experience within the space systems field and what they can tell me what should i expect how do you like it secondarily i heard about a supra coders program and was thinking about applying for it once im in is it a good way to pursue coding outside of a cyber job is it utilized well in space systems or would it just be for my personal interest in coding,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnXzByZGx4MnNJcUpGZHJuUWNsam5Sb2lRanFZWjZhSEZGMFE3eXZnYTNJSGJWa2NMSENEYU1MR3p4QXRRWWxGOXlRdUVhVjMtS2xpdnlaSGVRcjZzSEE9PQ==
for you sfsc it may be more difficult to be admitted to supra coders but if you have the support of your unit and great interest you can definitely get in also you likely will not be doing much coding in space systems likelihood is you will have to reclass but i would remain optimistic because space operations can be a great time then you can focus on your interest to code outside of work in a year or so when youre settled into your unit ping me on pm and i can send you more info to join supra coders,r/spaceforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncFpranYwSGJ5a09RY3puWDJ3WVJXRFhFRE5qQ0RFMU94NThkLXZrNW1WbXZfQ24wek5BRGd5WmZqNEdzekhYOTJEek0tYVZ2X3E1ZFlzMWNibHlyVDF1NFJnclg0cU1iT09QdkZuRF9Ia0k9
