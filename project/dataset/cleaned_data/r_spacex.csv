in this case it seems unlikely there was a rud of the entire stage but if a turbopump turbine lets go youll get parts travelling rapidly it looks like the merlin turbopump is mounted with the shaft along the long axis of the stage which would reduce the chances of shrapnel holing the tanks and causing a complete rud but i would guess if you got unlucky they could richochet off the combustion chamber but even an engine rud would scatter debris that could cause problems if it happened on a geo mission,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSEFNNEZYWElKaXBwSTlnN3AxWGhxRE4xWXFPaE9MQzFqRmFPSFc5c2RWd1ZReEQ2TzFuYXprWEptandqWEd2SmRUeGdOaUpvS3dmRVR4VHFfckk3dWc9PQ==

yes geo sats are supposed to go into a graveyard orbit yet operators routinely dont do it but operate their sats way beyond their design life until they drop dead in place that should be treated as criminal negligence and cause removal of license but it isnt,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY0lScm1QT0Y2ajhmQkFJNG1oM013a3N5WE1IbEF6NWhiOFhfTG14anV2TnRYLTIzZ3NkVWh5SGI4QWJQWmpJUmd1alEzYWF0T0RBdXA2OTltWVBKV2c9PQ==
spacex routinely deorbit their second stages targeting the open sea to avoid risks to the general public that is not always possible so some deorbit uncontrolled other operators like ariane dont have that ability and abandon their stages causing uncontrolled deorbit ariane <number> will have the ability for targeted deorbit once they have fixed the problem from their first launch,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNUR5ZmN2eDNvYVdFVGhFM3BiZ0Npak9qa0RlR2ZLNE5mNzhRYW1RX3VPdW54RERKTXhXMms2Q2xzS2g3TXhxWW1TSEZHV01DODEyVFV2X21pUnlBcVE9PQ==
anyones answer is just speculation there are good points to both sides this was a failure of the second stage that if it happened on a crewed mission could have been bad side for delays but also they could have been trying something new developmentally whereas crew dragon is in an older locked configuration so the worry might only affect their new configs or might be something they already know was specific to a change they made and not something that would have any bearing on crew dragons locked configuration side for business as usual personally i dont see this affecting crew dragon and i think it might affect polaris dawn but thats just my personal guess and all anyone can do is guess until official statements are made or missions go ahead as planned,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZTdGalRGWFhZakxTSnd5ZFR1Tll3QnlKYjZCeTg5ZU43NTJsU3JYXzNWdjVTaHdOaGJibWpqNUZmMXVSQ2Q4LTJMTlFpeVJOdDBMRGZiZW1vNXRxV2c9PQ==
the target orbit is low enough that the stage or debris would clear out very quickly not a big incentive to shut down prematurely,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOUZTZktaRllxSkI4clJyeWc1UXFKeG5XSkRDaDl3SmcwNDJQb3FKaFBVUGVyRE5ST21sRXlwTlhCRWMwOU5WOE9wcldvdE5mdkN3YmFscktkelpjNWc9PQ==

i would expect that a mostly intact stage with empty tanks will have a lot of drag it is large and lightweight for the size in that case debris will stay in orbit longer but at that altitude it will still be a very short time,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQXlMX0ZTb1FZeW5mNktfcmtKcUxncU9BOHVudFFFNUgtRlZGMlhLT3JtakladFR3Q25XUElUeUxMUDVJMEhUZTU3dlM4eURJdEpuWmQ0LVFscDduQ0E9PQ==

>also the stream graphics didnt show raptor ignition during splashdown probably something got damaged down there and it didnt show telemetry who knows maybe one of the vacuum raptors was damaged or fell off because of the heat unlikely that a whole ass raptor fell off but the other two were intact enough to fire because we know the burn was successful since we can see it slow down rabidly before hitting the water i think its more likely there was a telemetry issue spacex probably received the data but it wasnt relayed to the stream for some reason,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOXhfTVJfdjlTMXQ3QkxOaXpEMG9vX3VaQkZzQ0Jpd0lwQkVLc1puZ1JvRjhPeXZHRHoxNl8yUHVydVZMQ0RVeHM1bmhUbUZSeWlWeFJ6bkN3RFZQWEE9PQ==

i agree that simply holing the tank isnt likely to cause an explosion while in space its just too hard to get a combustable mix at sufficient pressure but thats not the only way for a rocket to explode spacexs two explosive failures so far didnt involve fueloxygen explosions amos <number> involved oxygen and the carbon in a copv and crs <number> was simply a burst helium cylinder due to a strut failing ive no idea what happens if a hot fragment hits a copv but if you rupture a high pressure helium cylinder you would likely have an explosive rud that scatters a fair amount of debris i would hope that they position such explosion risks to minimize the chances of damage from a failing engine but optimizing for how your second stage fails is probably not at the top of the performance optimization list as for apollo <number> the main debris was the entire <number> foot long bay door fragments of the oxygen tank itself and some insulation not insignificant but certainly not as bad as some debris events weve seen <url>,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNjhHZG1LNEE0aFhYLUdRY0huZWpXLU16VlhWZ1FvT0tUZ2xTYzAyZVNxZGpLU2dPU3ZwNXFHZFF4N01PRFlVeXN3OEgwUldwZHB0NmZhRzVKdUk0N3c9PQ==

not only new flaps but they are also further leeward as has been anticipated for some time for block <number> ships the aerocovers are also much smaller the tiles on the tip of the nosecone also extend quite a bit further down on the leeward side and overall the tile layout is different to the block <number> nosecones the block <number> nosecone also has what looks to be three small lifting hooks that are very close to top of the nosecone tip these are also much smaller than the hooks weve seen on block <number> ships they will have been used during the nosecone assembly and presumably now only be used for stacking the nosecone onto the payload bay until the two point lifter can be used as the ship stack and hence the weight increases too much the steel looks a lot nicer too heres two comparison photos from the ringwatchers old block <number> on the left ss nosecone and new block <number> on the right <url> the tiling is obviously incomplete on the block <number> aerocovers edit new photo from starship gazer <url> edit another photo from starship gazer shows a label on the new block <number> nosecones stand stating that its for s <url>,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTlpNMTd5Smp4MlFVOTJkNWpTeVRkMWV2bjdwUWJOMmh6X3FZN0oyb2hTdWJyNDU1ejctR3Q5Q19MWTdpeXkyUnR5b2N1R3prcl92NWdBd2tFQTZ6aVE9PQ==

if there was a rud of the entire stage then spacex wouldnt have had any starlinks to deploy into their ultimately fatal orbit my speculation is that the lox leak somehow resulted in a gas bubble in the plumbing between the lox valve and the turbopump inlet and when they started the mvac that bubble caused the turbopump impeller to overspeed and come apart which would have been the end of the engine,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUl96bkNwQ29DUXdZYnAtVlNYMVA3MW1ZZHVMMWdDYXd0b3ZaYldXYmVaUFd4QktkZER4ZmxjRmxyX3ZmME1KQWZYUEs5LU01YWVVQy11Rnk4YXl5MXc9PQ==

i was thinking and it might be silly or easily disproven and im not at all married to this idea but throwing it out there if i may could block <number> == v so we have the naming inconsistency which spacex does a lot but they come out with the stretched vehicles as v and v in the presentation and then we see actual hardware rolling out as block <number> so far so good if confusing but then on the latest eda tour tim asks elon directly about the future ships when we might see those and all and he was kinda cagey and kinda swept it off and the way he specifically mentioned stretched ships as a down the line thing seemed odd if v as we understand it was indeed being built as they spoke and saw like <number> minutes later im assuming this very nosecone then again to be fair it could just have been a matter of flight <number> tomorrow not relevant now anything else is forever away focus tim then theres b seemingly so far still a block <number> and from the math of it supposedly intended to launch s this new one raptor <number> if were counting them as necessary for the vs still appears to be a while away in the testing phase i mean itll take a while too to stack and fit out s and otherwise work up to actually needing it flying the remaining block <number> ships though s could be skipped so maybe the first rs arriving ends up lining up with s being ready for them but still anyway my point is could block <number> be sort of a subdivision of v where what we saw so far was lets say v block <number> and now v block <number> introduces the new flaps tile patterns etc etc but theyre still the same size same engines able to launch on a block <number> booster so they can keep iterating and verifying until r is flightready and then v proper is when they do the stretch and introduce raptor <number> and whatever else of course one easy way for this to fall apart is if they roll out the tank sections and they are indeed stretched but so far im not aware of that being possible to know yet most likely im overthinking it,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaM2tkQTJhYmpfdUxWQXh3V0xJYXRjV2RpT1NxWDVCWVBQVHVpMlg1Q2FYSmhldTE4eEZMOVpHMTcwT2RkOXM2LVVvWExwM2w1YTl5TnVwRUtZZ3JDbHc9PQ==
the thing is the cowbell seems to be over the lox header tank but not at its top which makes it an odd location for a vent so what if the lox header tank is also a cryogenic cooler for the nose during entry that way heat soaking through the tps from the hottest part of the hull is carried away by the lox heating up and then boiling boiling lox would create oxygen gas that needs to be vented and during entry the cowbell is on the top of the tank,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWN2RG9rTFVNbWxyVVNMa2VhaVZMSll1SmpGWHpVdTN6bm1iOUxjSVFpT01Kc3NRZjBBcVJNeTVUeGtlM0pjR2dZc0pyUExsang4MVUySDBhemJOVXc9PQ==

well you are right that it looks like the first block <number> ship s will launch on a block <number> design booster b the reason of course is that the block <number> booster upgrades do not add much to the performance with a very modest tank stretch but would still require changes to the ship qd in addition if they are just starting the testing of raptor <number> engines they are going to be short of engines for a while so it makes sense to put six new engines on the ship rather than try to put <number> raptor <number> engines on the booster i also think hls is going to be based on starship block <number> so it makes sense to get qualification of that design as quickly as possible starship just adds <number> ring of <number>m to the overall length of block <number> so it would be super easy to add to the design so i suspect they will make all the major block <number> changes to the ship together,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZkFkR1hsdXE1MUg5cWJUdzBHZVdhUEp5QTd6aUtFR3NFYnZpcDBCSzFYZEZ0dHRjdUFWTW9tNmVrUHh5RC1TMC1YMU9VQWdGSjFDMkw5MVZMbXpFY0E9PQ==

i dont agree the leak was there but the engine was working well letting the stage get to orbit as close to planned as possible would have been the safest then you can reenter where you want when you want with the recovery crew on hand instead of having to scramble them to the middle of the ocean an engine fault that would damage the capsule <number> meters and several layers of aluminium away would be highly unlikely and any would be unlikely unless the engine was allowed to run dry,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMVo4RlJNZ050cHFob0xHY1p5eFJFWUVTaFJBOTdUYW5rYjAxMGV0Um95TGNSRV90aFdRVzBJX0M3T3RVRFZvVFdaZWRQTnFBMXQ0bF83YkJha1Rkd1E9PQ==

just after the loss of mission elon tweeted that the engine experienced a rud on second stage restart it is possible that it was merely a failure to restart at most a loss of the turbopump rotor on propellant exhaustion even if his happened the computers on the second stage need not have been damaged,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadUpramtFbk1ySnV0RGVkMENwektLYmk1M2tmNC1BU05LbDVxVVlsd2o4RkE1WlpRbW9oRGNiRWVPX1FsSU1iT2s4Q1hsOWpNN05VUUc1ZVYyUjBsMHc9PQ==

more like <number> its probably the coast that killed it as it was leaking lox at a slow rate and that has more time to add up after min of coasting than it does during the initial burn to orbit restarting an engine with minimal propellant reserves is also a dangerous moment the circularisation and deorbit burns are only a couple of seconds starlink launches use the most efficient trajectory to orbit so when they get there they are at something like xkm and seco happens at the km bit they coast around to apogee and burn momentarily to circularise that it would be possible for them to launch directly into a safer orbit eg xkm with no coast or engine relight thats obviously less technically risky but would significant reduce the payload capacity their current trajectory accepts that extra risk to get the extra satellite or two but if and when the relight after halforbit coast fails the whole launch is lost given that they launched like <number> times before that happened once it was probably the right bet getting a couple of extra satellites up <number> times but losing <number> of them once the optics are not great though to people who havent done the math,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelNrNHhRZ2FXdGRMemVyX3U3THp3ZUppWXA4UTRLMUdlZGFFZTJTMm1CZmFic3VDU290OEJyQlhhUkdWUFlQNy1XOEpvNWxHY1huVXJYVE15ZUZUQmc9PQ==

in the video incredible quantities of water erupting out at high speed completely blocking sight of the launch pad then the engines ignite and suddenly there is no water even despite its immense volume its being blasted out too rapidly to even be visible then the engines stop and the unimaginable amounts of water resume even though it never stopped wow ^thats also a lot of lift to tie down good thing the pad held on to the rocket so there wasnt a repeat of that imitationf accidental launch two weeks ago but at ten times the scale,r/spacex,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMXdJY1V1Q3ZnU2tMVUpweDZQVENpZ3prQjlIUEsxZGVCWnN1cW1HbE1QOUl5RHhFbWRIX0RPWHRmTUpRcTR1WTE1SVFmWEhmM0tCUEIxenF4U2VqVnc9PQ==
