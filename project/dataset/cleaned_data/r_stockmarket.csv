short answer yes because of inflation gdp productivity growth only one of these needs to be positive inflation generally always is mostly all three are together longer one lots of ups and downs entire markets do get nationalisedwiped out sometimes ie russia china post communist takeovers etc it probably wont last forever but when that happens youll have bigger problems to worry about could be a nuclear war or something along those lines,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZLXRxWjRteTZ3SVdySkY0UVJmdUZEaDJUcTZRZTZZc1FLcXRZUzBrVVcyTVVRcHdvZTJpcVdkdkVNeXZMQTJoV3Y2NS05LWpKRjdBTkRLdXppOGhZd1E9PQ==

china does not allow foreigners to invest in their companies what they have done is look the other way as their companies set up offshore shell companies foreigners buy stock in those shell companies that allows chinese companies to raise capital and in return agree to provide those shell companies a share of their profits the chinese government can shut down those arrangements at any time i have every reason to believe that once china has enough wealth to fund the capitalization needs of their companies internally those shell companies will be shut down and the investors will be left with nothing the reason this has not yet happened is that i suspect the chinese government knows this will be a decision from which there will be no turning back they must be certain they are ready before pulling the trigger on it,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYjl6UV9rZTF2bEw2Vy1vX2U0c0FQN1g4VERQSVdBZjFwYXdrVmxmYVNLanVhYzNZVUFnQ213UnhJUXlkOGptYXZHVEdrZzFoM3lDcnJxUXhqWE1BV0E9PQ==

so heres the advice id give if i could go back and talk to my <number> year old self first are you sure you wont need that money anytime soon and are okay with potentially losing some in the short term if you are then great you can invest it stick with etfs for now whichever youd like although voo is understandably pretty popular here set your account to reinvest dividends and invest more whenever you have more disposable income now what do you do go learn youre <number> you dont know anything yet and thats not an attack maybe youre brilliant but theres a lot to be said for experience warren buffett didnt magically pop out ready to be warren buffett people love talking about how early he started but he grew up in a household where his father owned a brokerage firm and he studied for years under benjamin graham there was a lot of instruction education and experience that went into that success so go read up on bogleheads like someone else suggested and see if you still think stock picking is worth the effort learn how to research and value a company paper trade to test what youve learned emotion can be a killer in trading so pay attention to how you feel with your paper trading not perfect because it always feels stronger when its real but if youre feeling fomogreed know that that can make you jump into a trade too early or if youre getting too upset about losses you could abandon a good trade too early watch the market and companies on your watch list for a while to see what impact different macro and micro events have on their performance read about different strategies people employ not to try to copy directly but to see if there are elements youd want to incorporate in your own trading then when youre ready to trade youll be doing it from a stronger starting position better informed and likely with a lot more capital to deploy good luck youre already in a better spot than most by thinking along these lines as early as you are,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNU1ucUg1bTRGRzliRjF5LW9vZzNIU3c2eWFsejRLX0NDcEl1bTFtYkJFdGZJWmpQY2RXMnlGSWs5NVNVcFNuWTBDWTZ1VW9LV21DVFNkRkRPOUdyNEE9PQ==

the economy is a big money recycling machine when you buy a stock applicable to anything but well stick with stocks the money goes either to the seller who then does something else with it if the seller is a company for example they use that money to buy stuff that will expand the business more jobs more jobs for business they buy stuff from etc at some point the money turns into pay to consumers some of which will go into investments and the wheel keeps turning without printing more money you can have more money available to pay more expensive prices for things like stocks by the money machine just moving faster or put another way growth also its never guaranteed to go on forever it just will as long as our economy keeps producing more value if we lose our ability to growequities wont keep going up,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQndmRFNIQ3V1S0JwVE40dHpaX2RZVmpjeklYenhYQU42bEd2WkVrYjlyaTBOQXlXT01mYVlaRWVRMFJHcTlsWnNGY1VlQjhxQVZxakd1TU4wUF9ha3c9PQ==

i would say invest however you feel most comfortable the most important thing is that youre investing so early and your investments will have time to grow with time you can grow your investments through compounding interest and compounding frequency i dont see anything wrong with what youre investing in as long as you feel comfortable with it in your portfolio with the right strategies dividend investing is fine i would suggest if you are investing in dividend stocks to throw them in a roth ira so dividends dont get taxed and you can reinvest the dividends back into the stocks through drip plans if your employer offers a k take advantage of it especially if they offer any type of match also if youre in good health and get a hsa it might also be a good option for you these are just a few other options you might have that could help save on taxes ultimately its your choice on how you invest and youll have to live with your choices some choices will be good some choices will be bad but the important thing is to learn from your wins and losses try to do your due diligence on your investments try to set goals try not to invest on emotion and save i think youre off to a great start and i would advise anybody to start investing as early as possible keep up the good work,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWmZxa2VLb1lMdGl6ZlZPaC01YXRmdXlqVGZaUklVMHhHOUIzbEFueWNNR3dxTk9NSUstT3hoUkxSSFh4LUk2NHFnZUxnZDljVUF6aFZfRU9lbXhSMzZFdmFielA1QjFGWTRoQWtBN3Y4eXc9

recommend reading peter lynchs books first he talks through his stock picks and why he made them imo you should index invest until you find a company you want to swing at and you need to read the financials in order to understand why its a good investment compared to other companies every stock is just a money printer theyre all just printing at different rates you want to get the most future dollars for the least current dollars the actual price of the shares does not matter the market cap of the company relative to future earnings is what matters,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMWdULTd1UklhbXVGU0M2UjZydVBiTXFWUUdpZE1Fc3k1U2dLRXA1VUx4TjVUVzVRYlNwc1V2bVdDS01hQUZsemp2NlFWemJjY003X0N0OGMxMjhCS2c9PQ==

ill ask the important question how much time do you want to spend on an ongoing basis on your portfolio if you want to beat the market long term you need to become highly sophisticated and it will take tons of time thousands of hours of reading and research and practice for a couple years then at least a few hours a week for the rest of your life trading is often a zero sum game if you want to beat the market you have to know where a stock is going earlier than other people as a retail investor youre competing against entire institutions that do this every second is every day youre young enough that you can choose to go into this as your career i dont know if that will make you happy but its an option if you dont do that you need to commit time outside your other life obligations dont let anyone tell you theres a fast and easy way to get good at picking stocks and dont let anyone convince you theres a way to always be right you will still be risking money all the time the more gains you want the more money you have to risk losing in that respect its no different from gambling if you dont want your portfolio to be a fixture of your life that consumes regular amounts of your time you can just keep buying market indexes youre so young that youre at a huge advantage you basically cant lose with passive investing on your time horizon,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeWtSZlBVYmFaTDk2a0pSNGZobEh4cEpHd1ZSTTcyWjJET0gyaFpXYktpUEJtempIWkN2ODVYR3BBR0NYeWZyRGdOdEdZMEhZSG5GNXVVY2pKUTNPc1E9PQ==

im going to be direct with you no advice here will help you as youve only provided percentages of distribution i suggest that you look into either the meanvariance optimisation model which uses quadratic programming sounds heavy but it isnt to minimise the portfolio variance for a given level of expected return or the sharpe ratio optimisation model which optimise the weights to maximise the sharpe ratio which is the ratio of excess return to the portfolio standard deviation the risk im a firm believer of constructive criticism though and i will let you know that by doing compound interest investing x money into an etf fund every eg month is extremely good as albert einstein said compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world he who understands it earns it he who doesnt pays it,r/stockmarket,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna3dOMzFsTDdPbEg5NEJRZjItVDFSSF9iOF8ya1JmY21VejBFTElkWUpXTDB5VTM4dDNOOGJMak9wQ3dmSzBwSWcxcThGOFdkWGhVWm81Z2JsUDhUWWc9PQ==
