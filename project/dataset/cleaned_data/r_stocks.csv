theres an old saying something along the lines of the best way to make money in a gold rush is to sell shovels continuing that analogy nvidia is manufacturing shovels companies like microsoft amazon aws and google are buying up all those shovels with the intention of renting them out at a profit the next stage is all the companies that will rent the shovels in the hope that they can be used to make them more profit my focus as an investor for the next few years is going to be on the large cloudxaas companies who i believe will see their revenues take off significantly there are bound to be a few small caps that clock up exponential growth but the problem is finding them early and getting lucky enough with the few successes you pick to make up for all the inevitable disappointments,r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZmhhbEZvR2Iwa1p5aDBGS3hZX1diaWh5Y09DWkx0WEwtblc0NWN3eWNqM1ZhTlA1MGVxNTdzS1VUdnZMbmwzZkhwMjRWWEZjS3hqRUZ4Z21scDhYd2NYdzdqMkNOV1haZjhPUkdWOG9BdUE9

i do generally agree but im also afraid that my distaste for the stock is coloured by the current sentiment and recent developments i think its interesting because how much you get compensated for the risks you are taking aka the riskreward its not like these us companies are without risk the business itself is in my opinion great so its a country risk premium unlike anything ive ever seen before it just seems a bit excessive at the moment but who knows what makes me actually consider this is the buybacks and dividend which creates a situation where something has to give at some point is it the company melting down due to politicscompetition or will it be a repricing of the stock,r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQkUwTHU4UmdYUXhmYTFTNDRhN3VKYlNkOVNPNTJpemE2aDVXWEtuYkhuRk9DaEplb2NfLXhhSmo4V2g4WUpZRjBuZElzb3ZwVDNlRnljQTllLU5MWUtpN0p3MFYtWVJ1bG1zQ2ZPb1A3VmM9

no horrendous shareholder returns over the short and longterm to the point that should be unacceptable imo stock is about where it was twenty years ago secondly they are working on a new weightloss drug that is in the late stages of tier <number> trials other weightloss drugs have been very profitable looking at you ozempic people kept incessantly saying on here last year dont buy lly or nvo buy pfe its cheaper and has a weight loss drug too then the trial flopped and anyone who bought pfe because it looked cheaper rather than llynvo was disappointed lly is up about <number> over the last year while pfe is down <number> buying the worse thing because it looks cheaper often leads to disappointment the pfe drug is an oral version of danuglipron which was the drug that pfe announced the poor trial results high rates of adverse effects and discontinuation of in december of last year while the most common adverse events were mild and gastrointestinal in nature consistent with the mechanism high rates were observed up to <number> nausea up to <number> vomiting up to <number> diarrhea high discontinuation rates greater than <number> were seen across all doses compared to approximately <number> with placebo first off it has a very attractive dividend at <cur><number> a year <number> dont buy a stock because of the dividend the dividend is taken out of the share price and people have elevated the idea of dividends too much having a fundamental thesis and evaluating quality management etc is far more important than a dividend pfizer has a lot of name recognition from during covid pfizer made a lot of money from covid but their history of inept m a means that the market isnt showing any confidence that theyll actually spend that money well if pfe got a new ceo on the same level of larry culp coming to ge and pfe really is the immeltera ge of pharma id maybe consider it but otherwise theres too many good companies to invest money in one that isnt and arguably has an unacceptable record of shareholder returns over a long enough period at this point,r/stocks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna2ZnVEktUXpsRWJUUUl1NHJjR21HR1dRczJCMFlWVnJ2Yzd2emFCcDhiUE81ZjhYNGdPVlFLeUhqY1VwNXdUMWZpWUNXazJuUnJGQjdRSnh3YmNpTFE9PQ==
