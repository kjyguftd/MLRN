during the <number>s syrians were secularised even during <number> when the only reason any islamism existed was assad attacking protesters my family is conservative and even with that we intermarried with alawites the rebels at one point were products of that generation they were what tge west and europe should consider good yet that helped them with nothing now its different the syrian gen z and whoever will come after them will remind you of the days the soviet union crumbled and found itself losing against chechens you were forced to negotiate with chechens as for suffering i believe it benefited us undoing the secularisation we had i dont view it as a loss but when someone asks i point it out,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXQ0lQdGp4Sld5dXFDei1iMEU3Y1ZYalJ5VUpTM1hUNzFFVFpfNHhrYlFPbldlWEY2QkNFaEhraXIzTjdJU1g3MjlnRHZXaXRmYXBPTUNsUWZhTnI1emFjZmthdk1JcGFyaENWajJGcFduQ1k9

some additional points nsura had its news agency called al manarat al baydaa where isaa jesus christ was supposed to appear in the end of times there was a song they had about a war in dabiq against the romans there also is the idea that constantinople istanbul needs to be reconquered >abu huraira reported allahs messenger as saying >the last hour would not come until the romans would land at alamaq or in dabiq an army consisting of the best soldiers of the people of the earth at that time will come from medina to counteract them when they will arrange themselves in ranks the romans would say do not stand between us and those muslims who took prisoners from amongst us let us fight with them and the muslims would say nay by allah we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them they will then fight and a third part of the army would run away whom allah will never forgive a third part of the army which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in allahs eye would be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of constantinople and as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war amongst themselves after hanging their swords by the olive trees the satan would cry the dajjal has taken your place among your family they would then come out but it would be of no avail and when they would come to syria he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks certainly the time of prayer shall come and then jesus peace be upon him son of mary would descend and would lead them when the enemy of allah would see him it would disappear just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he jesus were not to confront them at all even then it would dissolve completely but allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance the lance of jesus christ its not a historical enemity with christians or what not its an apocalyptic worldview that attracts the despaired and gives them hope,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZTQwQXVCRzRpMU5FVlhvVFk5Z3pmekRMX0tWaW9VelB2SVNacXFtamJidnhpSDNyUjVRbWxhZUlNY2Q2dldBRTA2cFJJTTNRRnhLdWcteUVSWHJzTEFkUzhiT1EtWkFaNHQ1YW1CYWN0eGs9

taking out rome or specifically the vatican city and killing the pope would be a religious display that the christian god does not protect its own this works great in video game terms and would do some damage to the real life faiths of christianity but it wouldnt be as big a blow as is imagines and theyd never be able to actually hold rome for long at all i think its morale boosting and scare tactics that shouldnt be taken likely but nevertheless guarded against and i already imagine vatican city is well protected unless an army of <number> show up out of nowhere immediately,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacW5XRkhiT0tpWXFoUEdHLTF4dGlJMEJ0QW5pM2hzZHdRWW9VWF94QWsxSFlUZEtHX09DX1dmbXRoaW11a1I3eTJLdjRqUkUtZ194MVdXZDltZ0xhb2VKbGlqZXZfZEd3U1RHVGRWby1ZQWs9

throughout <number> years and tens of thousands of footage capturing bombardments infiltration attempts airstrikes shelling protests and a whole lot of barrel bombs leading to uncountable mutilated bodies of all ages and there are still people who deny any of this ever happened what are you really asking what is the purpose of these questions do you work for an entity that registers cases of attacks on protests or whose objective is to deny them if so just use the proper methods and contact someone on the ground in suwayda,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbXdKLUsyNVNmYmszQnVZYWp3TThqZ2J5eVpRWVdhZW1TVVZsRFJNTlBiVWhibG1mY19CUHVOWU9jYm9vQzd5WGRMWEVsY1NnWk1BVm45bWpzUjcybU5tcjBxX1M1N0FwVGIzd2t6cjlqb0E9
im trying to find out what happened there are hints on hawar that the protests werent that peaceful at least not in suweida countryside the author of this posting claims that assad forces opened fire for no reason in suweida city no conclusive evidence for that claim has been presented some years ago a posting like this without substantial information or even a checked geolocation would have been either removed by the mods or downvoted by the users,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZDg0MGVMRUpHTjZmUHZ5elZjdWdkb3hlMXRmR1VqT1ZRNFZqZ2w4YTJ2R2J1NFlPM2RaRnlvQUJ1S3pCU0E0OElrS2htVTJ0ZWM5ZFV0YTdYWUdvRVE9PQ==
i had to google to realize that you were referring to sdf affiliated hawar news that said their focus and in turn coverage is northeast syria aanescontrolled with suwayda being in the southwest as in exactly on the farthest side of syria geographically from the northeast i would take whatever they report about suwayda with a quarry of salt especially considering their affiliation with the sdf,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNTUwR2t1RjJVeEFfdW8zSnJUeHM2dTh0SFduUWE5bVhGMUZuaDgxVUVvQ1ZTbGpsQmtWbmZLSFc0Q3VjSjhDVnE4aVFFWTBYUGtMNnM4RnR5b0p0ZEpNcDlCZm5vaTQ3RXoxQ1VES1RTVlU9
huh what people in suwayda province are doing like burning paper ballots blocking roads occupying fake polling stations and boycotting the illegitimate elections are all perfect examples of civil disobedience the assad regime responded today with their usual violent terror tactics trying to intimidate the people in suwayda weve seen it all s of times before,r/syriancivilwar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMDFUMjV4SEpZMFBqR0tmYzUteVNUOWVCeFJyRHhxMWtCMzZBcGJldlBGbjVfZkhZU01MWHN1Nnd2Rkpya0dsUkpqbVYxVm5relpBVW9iMUpyTjB2WkE9PQ==
