i used to argue for this too that profit brings innovation but i honestly dont think i believe it in quite the same i did before i now believe in the negative hypothesis rather than the positive what i mean is this in places like the soviet union where people knew almost for a certainty that their work and ingenuity would go unrewarded and possibly even get them in trouble somehow it was extremely difficult to foster an environment of innovation and creativity we see that in similar societies as well so reasonably enough the inability to profit from ones ideas seems to crush the drive toward new ideas it doesnt follow from that though that merely providing the ability to profit will in itself drive creation or that its the only or even the best means of doing so and i think weve seen many times throughout history that the best and most important new ideas come mostly out of a sense of curiosity combined with the freedom to think and experiment rather than a simple profit motive alone,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbDgtV0s0UHQxdFJXLU9ITERlSnZPNkxReEh3dXVfRV9CY2NzRWxyNUoxZGtadWlsbEtrSHhVZXlXSTM5TTIzT1Jzak84RHRycXRqLU0wT0NqUnU2eHc9PQ==

and then there was aldi in europe until about <number> years ago they did not use scanners but their employees were insanely fast either way they had all the prices memorized and would punch them in and move the groceries faster to the end of the belt than any human being could possibly bag them cash payments were quick and easy too as the employees were still able to do basic math back then and usually had the change ready a millisecond after you handed over the cash,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUDVkZFZZc214eTVITWRHYlBzSFVUY0tMeU1SYmJRMmhwc0UwNm5jaWQtUTNhWGFtWGxpeWxwVjZSLWE2UGJyRHF5N09GT2k3bkdTQ3ZpNF9TOFNhVVlremxNTFRlcGNQbWxvSWpvV1MwLVk9
i assume like liion they use a cccv charging scheme thats constant currentconstant voltage the batteries are charged at a constant rate of current until the voltage rises to a set maximum then tapered off to maintain that voltage the first <number> or so of charging takes place during the constant current portion furthermore multi cell batteries require a battery monitoring system that balances the individual cell charges as capacity and charge level may drift as the battery ages this can also add a small amount of time to the final charging so because the current to charge to that point is no longer constant and the curve is relationship is no longer linear after <number> giving the total charge time would be misleading when comparing usable capacity across chemistries you dont have to charge them to <number> every time you use them in fact if the goal is to swallow up energy as quickly as possible you wouldnt want to,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTRkpDQVJyNFpWbTlnbUdnbl9UUjZsTmJ0aVkzZmxhUWUwZUhUUW9IQ3BQVjhCMGQySnRnaDBUZUVEeVNLTEc4dkRWME8wdmwxU3Z6TEwxNnJraVYzNmc9PQ==

hey thanks for giving an intelligent response i agree that more conditions than profit motive alone are necessary for the best innovation but the profit motive is the fuel that drives people to keep working even when its uncomfortable and no longer fun and maybe more importantly it allows people without much money to start businesses and pursue ideas that they wouldnt be able to afford just on curiosity alone in a society without the profit motive entrepreneurs and inventors wouldnt be able to raise the capital necessary for their innovations if banks and lenders didnt have faith that the business would make profit in the future and thus be able to pay the loan back with interest if you remove the profit motive from society then you also remove capital investment and market liquidity as people would basically only invest in stuff if they were friends with the ceo or personally liked the project without the ability to attract investment for a good idea the work of innovation would be available to only the already very rich in society which was basically the situation in the middle ages before the spread and success of capitalism normal people with great ideas that would benefit society would have no mechanism to make their ideas reality because theyd have no mechanism to attract investment because there would be no mechanism in society to reward good investment,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdUc1eXdobDI3NGxtbHJkaTFJUnp5ZDBXUGl6NVE4VVdRZ2dFcjQ3akRVMlBuWnNNdlhzRjAxTzNRWDBYRk11ejQ5eHM1MVJXUVl4ZTlMbFJiWElQMEE9PQ==

you can make it just as good as regular concrete and use less cement in the process which is where the carbon savings are coming from using coal ash in this way isnt really new though and as we are transitioning away from coal the ash is becoming less available unfortunately its not really a good solution because we would need to burn more coal just to generate enough ash to keep up with the concrete industries demand obviously a little counterproductive,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMXNCOVNVRjNadUlhWFJTSnliY3Iwbk15aWx2MGJudl9JX2YwRWlWOUtxenJaQTJMbGZzVGJsbFZOb2JCelVrY05SVGVWLU0ybVZpZU5jY1hPWE4teUE9PQ==

yea the problem then becomes the actual processing when its redirecting a waste stream you have an active entity that is invested in redirecting their waste so there is some logistical impetus that helps get the ash into the concrete if you have a company whos sole business is going into the old waste sites and processing the ash and selling it thats a lot of overhead and that makes what they are selling much more expensive than the active sites that are practically willing to pay you to take it off their hands and at the end of the day if you cant keep green concrete cost neutral you unfortunately dont have a lot of demand for it even if it is better for everyone perhaps a good incentive program and actual government investment could make this a feasible solution to clearing out the monofills but they will eventually run out and we will still need to make more concrete,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZFQ5QWlFS1htNnlkY1Fjbjd3SWZaMF9wY09mYzZvRUtpQmxBbWh5UXVvZU5yRjRBLVpYYnBtOEpsQktFMlNoSFVrZ2tZRjJLU0FMMUxNWnpvNzliMHc9PQ==

i reread my comment im not sure how its unclear the connection i was making ill try rewording it the first commenter asked what it the paralysis had to with making him bilingual it did not make him bilingual he was already bilingual the man is unable to speak at all due to the paralysis the implant when developed would enable him to speak again the clinical trial found that the signals controlling the vocal chords tongue etc were similar between the languages so training the implant to recognize words in english could help it to recognize words in spanish and vice versa it does not give you the ability to speak a language you dont know its about restoring your ability to speak in bothall of the languages you do know if you cant speak due to paralysis,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQWpjQmxvYUFYMDVnOHFfRW5kZl9RWmVING5teDdMbDIyZWJpWUpValI4anFJVFg2WEtoUnFwMnFGeS1zenN0b00wc0oxZUlHX1pOakVxSndfTFdIQkE9PQ==

what im getting from the article is that his brain is doing all the work of forming the sound of the word the implant is just interpreting the neurological activity of intending to make that sound and translating that into a signal to the parts of the body needed to do so since english and spanish have a similar phonemic inventory it would make sense that the signals for both would also be similar it kind of lost me when it started talking about training the ai and word errors though if im understanding it correctly the ai wouldnt actually need to know a language it would only need to know which signals correspond to which sound and then what it needs to do to make that sound if its just interpreting the intention to make sound why would it need to be trained on a different language is it using a language learning model to guess the word theyre trying to say,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTU0xZQzNfQUVva2d2ZDBhemEwdVk0STU4Zk5DUksxaW1XSS12RmV5UGhWMlpZN2RLcThURGRkWTFxaHJEZUEwWk9wSndWakhwQkstUkdhM0plTFp3Wmc9PQ==

ive always thought cyber sec was cool but anyways im only tangential to this stuff but the short version is that you use testing to iterate a computational physics model not the design itself necessarily once your computational model looks good you let it loose on optimization of the design ive seen simulation that is shockingly similar to the real life test that follows it the goal being to reduce the amount of costly real life testing required maybe completely its a subtle difference but one is iterating the design and seeing what works the other is iterating the understanding of the underlying physics so that you already know how a given design will work edit for basic stuff the physics is also already known via material properties but in a complex and dynamic during crush assembly it gets hairy,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUR2o4d2RHZl9uNEdHNVFIWC1Ga2hnV2d0MXp0dTVPZTNlWDk0S281amhGM0xIeEpkMmo3Q3JKM2phbFQ3aTJTcHJFRFJ3Mjl5cFk0MXdiMDJ0b2pieVE9PQ==

well to distill your argument another way we invented the calculator why learn maths why look under the hood of a calculator when it just gives you the answer edit just let simulations deal with if the building will collapse why work on all the calculations of load bearing and supports and such edit just let the computer design a better airplane why painstakingly mix all the wind tunnel testing and test pilots and certifications and all that expense when a magic box can simply say this is viable edit weather patterns large scale traffic literal physics simulations etc a computer can give you the answer why look into how the answer itself is calculated dont you trust and thus not need to double check their work ai is a lot more complex but the same principles hold,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUbkoxNjlhR1NhLUVNQ2FZVUNTYXVoeWVfdUlkd0VYaGk2VHJ5aW8xM3VzUjg5TDdSTWhoRTJKVzd0U0NqSjlpS0NzZFQ4Sl9uQ1NOcjZnUDVlaF9sdlY1NUIxR1VkNW1nWHJUTURXU21SN1k9

this is interesting i work at a steel mill very newly hired that uses a blast furnace i also know about the electric arc furnaces that many mills use the reason we still use our blast furnace is because electricity doesnt get hot enough to produce certain kinds of steel so i am curious if this new process solves that issue however as far as pollution at my mill we capture all emissions and reuse them through the process so it is not as bad of a pollutant as some may think,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVVVY4a3p1MmlGSTMwdjM0ekZUYl9WakFWLVFvdmk5REFBZXA3U1hOWFV6Y1dRbWlVNkJrdTZCODk3Z3VrcGJIVUpvemtfbXV0Y0w0QlU1bDVRdF9jUlE9PQ==

well you dont really need to do that anyway a large chunk of new iron in the steel cycle is created in the production of ferroalloys and submerged arc furnaces primary method for most ferroalloys are better at using chemical reductants than open arc furnaces,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVdlpBaVhZMFBJZmJRQW52OVhhRlJ0X3FMVTVHOG5TbDdFRm9KVms5U1E5ZERzbkNKTno2NVpoLW1aY0FmaFlPRnRxWmNSTThWQzJHRE1fXzZfZWZETXc9PQ==
partially true when producing steel you usually add a mix of ferroalloys and they usually produce iron from iron ore in submerged arc furnaces so when recycling steel you do add new iron for instance you take in scrap mix it with some ferroalloys like <number> ferromangane or <number> ferrosilicon and boom youve added more iron without the use of a blast furnace still its not the primary way iron ore is turned into steel,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWGFZR2lWLTJfbzNVUHJQUElwZzIyWW1pbjEtSlF1dTMxX3NHUlZmQ2NjQXVaNGJPSmpaQlJGU0VjcjhhWFdKano2bmhjSnI5Z2NJNTdLaUlrVWIyb0E9PQ==

this isnt quite the right way to frame it i used to believe this too but its really more of a fundamental biological issue the female reproductive system isnt alwayson by design the release of new eggs stops during pregnancy for example so theres a natural offswitch that can be taken advantage of its sensitive to relatively small and safe hormonal changes and while it does have sideeffects it is relatively safe and we have a wide variety of options the male reproductive system for contrast never turns off there is no dormant period there is no menopause sperm production keeps chugging along until the gametes accumulate damage due to aging if you want to reduce male fertility youve got no natural switches to take advantage of its just a physiologically more difficult problem which is why the trials on candidate drugs so far have had much more severe sideeffects were talking about upticks in suicide among the treatment groups not something that should be taken lightly on the bright side vasectomy is safe and affordable it just cant be reliably reversed,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWX0Uxc2hlTVNGWDE0alJwZ1FUTHgycU55c0hqSkRlck9PQW5GZDJqczJHMVBnSTZ3d0tRVlJIM1ZHQzRuOEpqVHFGTkk1djVTQVZRZkFucWMzNVl4ZlE9PQ==

female birth control has also been shown to have an increased rate of suicide along with a host of other potentially life threatening or debilitating issues cardiovascular issues endometriosis cancer but the benefits outweigh the risks all they do about the female bc risks is increase monitoring switch meds or advise to stop taking it it really seems like the bar is much higher for acceptable risks in male bc just because there are highly effective nondrug options that a lot of men dont want to use because of weakass reasons like condoms dont feel as good or not wanting to risk irreversible infertility despite having several kids already because then theyre no longer men or something we are far too protective of mens balls and fragile egos,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWMjZ0WDNlMkYzNEZsQ0lRNnh5WnYtQzdRZnUzSXRBaU1pV3NVV3E0a0NpLWdoRThNTVViY3I5akt1QXRIbm5XbVFOYmtKUG91SzRLS1F6eTFWLVp6S0E9PQ==

they also dont seem to understand that ethically there are a lot of problems prescribing something that will have moderate to severe side effects to a patient that will receive no physical benefit from it by necessity women need to avoid pregnancy so a certain amount of side effects are balanced out by the physical benefit they get of not having a pregnancy and how dangerous this is theres nothing in medical ethics that lets you damage your patient to benefit a different person so there is that issue thats why vasectomies are acceptable because they have negligible side effects usually,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWdmY4T2JlemtNQURoYy1CSGctN0RtTlBGUkhVaG5sbnEtUkR3R25rSzJwUzZKUi1QRi1lWVpBOVBDVDFta0hKWEhHUUdRS2kwNy1rVUVYZkpJVThmNHc9PQ==

you think youre making a good argument but youre not for starters lets clarify we know exactly how ensemble methods work and what they do they are just made of math that there isnt enough time in a lifetime to do but there is no mystery at all thats the majority of machine learning algorithms classification recommendation identifying candidates from sets reducing relevant information from hundreds of features to the first handful are examples that have been in heavy use for years identifying cancerous moles accurately is one big success story for these types this whole tangential subject is about neural nets we do know how they work you have a network of nodes with functions in them you feed them your feature set for a data point and they make a guess you show them the answer and then they adjust their node functions and try again there are some methods like gradient boosting to improve training but they actually arent necessary because the node functions are very simple the network has layers that play certain mathematical roles and we can describe those with math for example there is a layer of activation functions which act as a weighting filter for values respective of certain thresholds this guy doesnt have the jargon to convince you but hes right looking at a bag of activation functions wont tell you anything looking at the node structure does sometimes having reverence for discovery isnt enough the devils in the details you actually have to do the math to know what youre talking about and you seem like you havent,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjWGY3cFlGN0UxRXdQNURiWXZFTURtamlVekNUU3ZpVFVrTVVJVEw5Zk1CYXVYZkhlckZ1Y2JqSjU0SmZnMWxKRjZyRkFZVFZYVXNVcTg2NkRMNXNMREE9PQ==

it is actually in the case of machine learning math is the only thing an algorithm understands much like voltage is the only thing a computer understands you could watch your algorithms nodes while a particular data points features are passed through the nodes and see how those functions change but you do that many times in different orders with different training subsets if you really want to see how the inclusion of one data point changes the overall output you will have to interpret some very bland calculations bland to the point of meaninglessness doing it this way just wouldnt really tell you much unless you wrote another algorithm to describe the changes in a way a human could understand but it would all be math start to finish validity and attribution are concepts native to mathematics and to machine learning without a mathematical engine you cannot have ml,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjUXRDdjVsUDhtTU9yOWQ1YmZvUHMyNVVQUmZKQ0cwSG9ROTR5aDFCNzFrU28xTFl2WWczS1V0SDYzTVB6MEZHTzBadUtNWmhEcFN2QmdJc0FndjNrbWc9PQ==

yes youre correct but youre missing the same point as the other guy in all these as you already know machine knowledge algorithms currently is to crudely put throw shit at a wall using multiple adjusted mathematical formulae and from the results select the ones which formed a promising picture to further refine the process the removing cancerous modules bit among other things yes we all know how the nodes work we all know how the weighing anchors the various layers etc but we dont know the whole of the system ultimately we can throw shit on the wall all day long and hope the testing criteria is correct enough to weed out all the wrong results but it is also true we dont know how the created refined algorithm got to that results or if there is a bias in there that might ruin said results outside of test parameters the oh so famous hallucination of chatbots comes to mind perhaps i too am too focused on the word specific here but we just dont know how ai works on a macro level just like we dont know how the neural net of a brain works despite roughly knowing what each section does what would be the golden grail would be to extract and learn that macro level logic because if we can we can also throw out the guesswork the biases the testing etc we can then refine that extracted algorithm to be adapted on things that are not so easily testable you cant delete cancerous nodes if you cant test for them yes and still be confident it is still working properly after sure that algorithm wouldnt be ai anymore but it is worth knowing yes that is a goal worth going after right this rigid algorithm derived from an organically learned ai and that is only one possibility we can learn from within the black box whole that is current ai research but what the other guy did is say nope theres no worth in knowing this there is none who can do the math for this and it is impossible dont even think about perusing any possible knowledge from ai since we know we control all of its mathematical shackles there is no knowledge worth knowing from ai none at all despite ai itself being an ongoing constantly refined field of research thats what i disagree with to which my answer is yes we still want to know please feel free to tell me im wrong,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjS041VE9OTGFhZnZqcEFZR3dHMzBGUlpyQ0lUd3FRUlRiVEU0MEEyS0xtWUVEWEZHNFpzVTRoQmI3OTJZUnl2WUtsTmRfdC1EUmM4ejc0MTZBc3YzWDU5TUU0cGx3Szdoc0FPVHhFdkRIZjg9

this comment section is going to be the death of me biochar is a technique for carbon sequestration it uses a process called pyrolysis to lock carbon that would otherwise leak into the atmosphere through biological composition into a form that will remain stable and solid for theoretically thousands of years it is a useful tool in the effort to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gasses the science is sound and therefore biochar projects fetch some of the highest prices on the voluntary carbon market the trick is to find uses for the resulting char that make projects more economically viable applications should incentivize developers to bear the relatively high capital cost for pyrolysis kilns and incentivize farmers and others with potential feedstocks to spend their time and energy to collect them meanwhile you want to find applications as close to source as possible because transporting diesel trucks full of char all over the place would chip away at biochars ghg mitigation benefits mixing char into organic fertilizers is one emerging application so is incorporating it into building materials a major advantage of both applications is that the mixing can happen close to the chars source and close to where the end product will be used since agriculture forestry coffee consumption and construction happen everywhere and often close to one another,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeVU3cmw2U1ZmcElFczU1LVVLSTI1c2QxcVVPYjBLRURTaDdQWHFFU1VRRlpJa29vb29LZkR3a0REZmwyMkRWQ3Q4MFlwejdOQVRXb0RVcU5wSm93ckE9PQ==

i tend to disagree i work as a sales for a company that is ranked as the most energy efficient in terms of infrastructure equipment like the hpc mentioned in the article the energy efficiency never comes as an objection from a customer point of view as long as it demonstrate roi for the end user it really doesnt matter how much energy it consumes as long as you are making x or x return on the investemt anyway they just dont care i cant even use this argument of energy consumption a be taken seriously most of the time so im really happy that these companies are now leading by example and taking this argument seriously and getting all the hype and the merits pressuring the other ones to do the same its a step ahead for the environment that combined with some green energy sources like solar and and even using cold termal water from the underground like the aruba center in italy can be really helpfull for both the environment and for the companies on the long run,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlaUdXSGdRMTJ1ZG4waFpMWk94ZlpaeXYybUN1RlRFbmJzbmZSNVZFemdCRm41Mm9SbHJodDhNdHpIaWIwY0FUYUFaZGtUZHNNaXlOVFRZNkdYOHU1VVE9PQ==

in the case of neuralink i think its more of a sunkcost fallacy and appeasement regarding musk and the us government or some other sort of dangerous dynamic thats related he has already gotten billions and billions of dollars for spacex and starlink despite catastrophic failures in the former and him dictating foreign policy via the latter when for example he decided to turn off the ukrainian militarys ability to control drones as they were literally in midair on their way to attack major russian targets the fda approved human trials for neuralink implants after a series of investigative reporting revealed the dismal failure of the devices in animal testing not just failure but the heartbreaking agony suffered by most of the primates before they finally put them out of their misery they are reporting that in the first human subject a significant number of of the wires in the implant have migrated away from it and are protruding from the scalp which is exactly what happened in the animal testing and since these poor animals didnt understand what was happening to them they dug and picked at the wires and gouged wounds into their own heads which became constantly infected and then the infections spread in their systems and began affecting their kidneys and other organs i got sick to my stomach when i read just one or two of the articles that described this testing i suggest you dont these articles also revealed that neuralink and the lab that conducted the testing are under investigation by the animal welfare group that specifically deals with animals who are the subjects of animal testing a slew of regular animal welfare groups and federal agencies from the usda to the dot and yet our government is letting this fucking maniac experiment on human beings edit spelling,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMlJQT1hNMXp2WHpvTFRZa1NORVkxaUN1YVdrZzZQdk14Q3cwdVRwVGd4M2sxdHNYdXg3b2JETjVjOW9NV0pSSE9NVWw2a25JS1VBM2JUcnkwQTFhQm9lb293aGVXbFJwVHN6ZDlycFAxRU09

i listened to an interview with the guy who has the implant last week the reason they need to go deeper is because they miscalculated how much a human brain moves and something like <number> of his electrodes retracted because they werent in far enough even still he says they managed to use software updates to correct it and it works even better now than it did originally with only <number> of the electrodes working,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMjluTnZILWxQaDhBVTQ4LVFqdzZkRU1jeUJ6anhzeS1FVXVibk9saGJSWHRuREN4YXlZaGRNRS00VnRJb1BabEZOR2hwY0t1dEU3dmFwZWJIU05PbEE9PQ==

why not one allpurpose blob did i ever tell you about the man who taught his asshole to talk his abdomen would move up and down you dig farting out the words it was unlike anything i had ever heard this ass talk had a sort of gut frequency it hit you right down there like you gotta go you know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it feels sorta cold inside and you know all you have to do is turn loose well this talking hit you right down there a bubbly thick stagnant sound a sound you could smell this man worked for a carnival you dig and to start with it was like a novelty ventriloquist act real funny too at first he had a number he called the better ole that was a scream i tell you i forget most of it but it was clever like oh i say are you still down there old thing nah i had to go relieve myself after a while the ass started talking on its own he would go in without anything prepared and his ass would adlib and toss the gags back at him every time then it developed sort of teethlike little raspy incurving hooks and started eating he thought this was cute at first and built an act around it but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking on the street shouting out it wanted equal rights it would get drunk too and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed the same as any other mouth finally it talked all the time day and night you could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up and beating it with his fist and sticking candles up it but nothing did any good and the asshole said to him its you who will shut up in the end not me because we dont need you around here any more i can talk and eat and shit after that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly like a tadpoles tail all over his mouth this jelly was what the scientists call undt undifferentiated tissue which can grow into any kind of flesh on the human body he would tear it off his mouth and the pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow there grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell so finally his mouth sealed over and the whole head would have amputated spontaneous did you know there is a condition occurs in parts of africa where the little toe amputates spontaneously except for the eyes you dig thats one thing the asshole couldnt do was see it needed the eyes but nerve connections were blocked and infiltrated and atrophied so the brain couldnt give orders any more it was trapped in the skull sealed off for a while you could see the silent helpless suffering of the brain behind the eyes then finally the brain must have died because the eyes just went out and there was no more feeling in them than a crabs eye on the end of a stalk,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN2RLanRaYk1qM01yZ1ZGd1JCcVB5WW5Qbm5PY0V4T0xyUGdjTFRaSkNsWDRnbm9adldBSFN6Z1hrbFphZlU1TEtLc0d3U1dVX09wWUl4UmJOMXc0TWc9PQ==

do you know any of the specifics of this all i can seem to find is that its a tooth regrowth treatment but i dont know if its like a shot thats you get in the arm that will make you grow a new set of teeth or grow missing teeth or if its a topical treatment if it was a topical treatment then maybe it could work well as a dentist you inject the drug into the right spot for the tooth to form then it grows in it wont grow in the perfect shape or in the perfect location but those can be fixed if the location is off you adjust with braces if its too large for the other teeth around it you grind it to fit if its too small you add a crown or if the tech got good enough for really advanced cases you might just pull all of someones teeth and grow them a whole new set maybe they grow in all misaligned and misshapen but then that is effectively your canvas as dentist to form a proper set of teeth out of you shape and move them all to produce a workable set of teeth,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmRWRXdDJPOWx2R1JuMzVOZS15aXNDbkNYdGhvRXo3c2NPZVpKMWticHJoQ3g0TkpfWTRLU1JTSUpETUY1RTBnUURibTNBbWZyV1dhbVlVLWR0cHB5Y3c9PQ==

having recently had to have a crown followed by wisdom tooth extraction i feel i can confidently say that extraction+regrowth is not likely to replace crowns or even root canals with crowns youre fine the next day outside a bit of soreness with tooth extraction youre looking at weeks of recovery time and presumably even longer than that while you have to care for the site as the new tooth slowly grows and erupts you have to obsessively keep things clean cant eat normal food for ages run the risk of dry socket its not a good time tooth extraction is also a much more traumatic experience emotionally ive never had a root canal though unfortunately i may need one soon the molar i had the crown on which was very impacted by my wisdom teeth is still iffy its been a saga ive talked to my dentist a lot about what that would look like and frankly while i dont love it the procedure and recovery genuinely sounds not so bad i would definitely <number> no hesitation from a patient standpoint take a root canal over another tooth extraction i think its fair to say that this would primarily be useful at the point that you got to needing an extraction today and would mostly impact bridges and dentures now on the other hand if the tooth grew in like a new adult tooth replacing a baby tooth and the old one slowly became loose and fell out and we didnt have to do a surgical extraction i could be sold,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmWlRpY2MtNTU1elJNcWo2QlBoRGh6NGFockl4d1pwaHNwdDJSd24wbzN2OV9fQnFFLXdEVHEyaFlBQkNmUEJnUHg2R3QwSUIwbGkxdmpzNjZNS2JSRUE9PQ==

> could you go into what youre thinking about when you say it might replace root canals the purpose of a root canal is essentially the elimination of the nerve if the option is there to regrow a tooth so you can both eliminate the infection and maintain the nerve i see it as a possibility enamel production stops roughly by age <number> there are already conditions that are caused by enamel not being produced when the teeth are originally growing so it appears as though tooth growth and enamel production are distinct mechanisms so i wouldnt make any assumptions about the ability of growing a tooth automatically meaning enamel production,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN0sxM2tNNWg1TFlaZjJNOVg3bDJ4ejBPOVFSaHJleU8wc29rTVU3S0s3XzkzTE9RVXpqdDRDdnpGTmkxZmFCNkpybXZJckV1eVctOEFJcjl4bDhhNXc9PQ==

the nerve is inside the tooth though extracting the tooth extracts the nerve inside it since its all part and parcel a new tooth would need to grow a new nerve a root canal just hollows out the nerve in the tooth and fills any abscessed area below it enamel production is part of the overall tooth growth process the reason most enamel production stops around age <number> is because the adult teeth have their enamel already but havent erupted sure the tooth growth process can have an error where the enamel isnt produced but its not like youre constantly producing new enamel on existing teeth up until then your primary childhood teeth arent repairing their enamel up until then its just that your permanent teeth are still developing their crowns below the gumline in your jaw also im just going to go out on a limb and say its unlikely theyd get approved for human trials if the tooth they were growing had no enamel and were going to be completely fucked up enamel production actually continues longer technically since it is still forming on the wisdom teeth after this age that can continue until around age <number> or so its just because those teeth are still developing,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmcDVxQmJ2T2FYbGIxRWk3WjdoZml3b0ZaM2dLcTJaWHM1QlJRaEFRNlh3N2tFTDhFWHdrYzIydXUzVlVaYl92bGF0dWNkZDlTNDlzSS1wcUJwLUM5VlE9PQ==

not an expert either but since most people who get frozen are either very sick or very old theyre basically hoping to be thawed out when theres a cure for whatever ails them and hopefully fix all the busted cells its either that or they get thawed out by some alien who had a craving for some monkey soup,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtazlldHBfNmh5OUNEdWxCNURzaW1JU1F0MnZ0bDAwMkUtaFFrOWxJVEZGSUgwSVVmZVpsUVBLclBfZUhKQ0ZqYkR1WjlTSDBKd0ZMVUFVLTZpMjg3QWc9PQ==
~~its not the thawing that destroys the cells its not being frozen fast enough~~ slow freezing cause the ice crystals to form in jagged shapes and of course ice slightly expands these two factors cause tons of tiny punctures to the cell walls flash freezing prevents the ice crystals from forming jagged shapes or at least they are very small which leads to minimal damage to the cells edit a kind user has educated me apparently both the freezing and the thawing cause damage,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtWVB3YXNxZWRJbjI3bFZlUFE1by1OdnhrX3o1d1duME5fd05QZjNFWkdCNmQ3d2l0NFJ5Qkpwc2swTGJPbFU4OFEwRFY2WTlSSHliU3R0c21IcnV0N2c9PQ==

actually it does both processes destroy cells flash freezing is much easier than flash thawing and when things thaw its difficult to control refreezing in certain parts we also supposedly have antifreeze type chemicals to prevent crystal forming think like when ice cubes in your drink fuse because they freeze enough of the surrounding liquid to form a bond,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZEdtUWdGRS1ETHRxTjM4bHp2alNYUWRNUkQ3TUNmVzFYN0hUYmVoM3VIZllvMXdkX2FQSmY4dXdreUF1MktCbkxZU1BQSU1icVROdnF5QnZ2WUtIYlE9PQ==

death isnt defined well legally you have to be pronounced dead before freezing i think but your brain is still fully alive for a few minutes longer if they allow precooling so in theory if they can dethaw you you would wake up exactly as alive as when you were frozen so it depends on what was killing you as to whether future more advanced medicine could resuscitate,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtU3pTcU1vdWlYaDI1WndoVTNucnUxQUlYTFMyMXdvSWQ5cVEtell6X2twY2FmZ3hyWGJOTU1SalZtMC16Q2NDQmxxNUVIVzVUMmJZOU5GVVRvQ0N2c0E9PQ==

i dont think thats the intention at all i only know so much about this because i used to work at an estate planning firm that had extremely wealthy clients with alcor memberships you sign up in advance and pay fees to be a member when you are literally already about to die like the point where youre on your deathbed you call the alcor emergency line and an ambulance comes to get you to transport you to the facility our clients would create trusts to continue to pay alcor after their freezing so that their remains could continue to be maintained and then because these were very wealthy people their remaining assets would be tied up in other trusts and charitable foundations with ongoing wealth management so that they could reclaim their wealth upon reanimation its the opposite of euthanasia these people dont want to die they want to live forever and they want their money waiting for them when they return,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtaG14MUk4cVFvLWNzSDFMQkwxVkg3MHRPMl9vWFVrX3NXVFpHT1p6bVpOM01lY1h0ZVVwcXR5R0FHTkFpOFBOcFNONC1yM1lncGpuRGhWbld2Q09BOFBkZzlFOXM2UFYtZEpXYnh1UV9OZms9

its not happening in <number> years even with an insane tech boom the field of medicine is gonna take wayyyy longer to apply that tech in a way that allows them to reverse clinical death and make no mistake all these people who are cryogenically frozen are dead dead this isnt a videogame where being frozen like that lets you be revived in <number> years brain cells start dying very rapidly once you have a lack of oxygen unless the person dies in the cryogenic chamber and theyre frozen instantly exactly at the moment of death which is not how cryogenics happens theyre just plain dead <number> minutes of having your heart stop will already lead to brain damage and the longer you go past thay the more irreperable it becomes too many brain cells will die to ever even consider attempting reanimation so all the cryogenically frozen people are actually just frozen corpses that can never be reanimated the company the stores them will eventually go out of business and those corpses will just be given back to the families for burial or cremation not saying it can never be done in the future but thats gonna be long after all people living today are gone none of the currently frozen people will ever be brought back,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtRFlhOU5CY1pXUXA3c2VBdTdJcjV5QTVhWWY2WUx1VkdTTmkwdnpJYms1S1Fydm0wcmZreXh2NDVaNGFSdzJIeGxvcUc3T1JuNTV6NXRPWWozOWo3VVE9PQ==

you have to keep a bunch of dewars at constant freezing temperatures forever which isnt easy or cheap the people that do this have estates and law firms who get paid to keep an eye on these cryo firms to make sure they dont just take the yearly payments and dont keep anything frozen theres hideously complex arrangements in place with all the specimens and their estates with heirs suing to terminate so they can keep their inheritance intact health regulations to follow for storage of human remains plus the complications of the medical procedures to prep the bodies then theres the lawsuits when a facility loses power and something thaws theres absolute genius scams and then theres scams that chain you to maintaining dead people and their lawyers forever no this is a scam but its to let people experiment on dead bodies not to get rich,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtM2JqbFJDNEJfMlc3VDZaUDFpOUlpSkRmZ09yeHpkMTZyZU1lanMxNXlGczBSM3Zqc2xjMkl4ODFkVGxJLURRZ2t2WlhuQTJaUUp3YnBzbHV2eThFdWc9PQ==

taking down a botnet is massive absolutely massive they are distributed and non centralized and so you cant just walking into the room with the server and flip the switch off they are spread across thousands of computers all over the world and they dont care if you take down like <number> of the nodes the other <number> will continue to work so to take down an entire network is tough you need to secure the credentials and work out how to deactivate it know the topology of it have access to the source code obviously if youre clever you can probably get around some of that but its still a lot and then you have to deploy some kind of neutralization which would be a pretty highly technical thing shutting down the botnet itself is bigger than arresting the person i think the headline is fine i think maybe your consternation is based on you not appreciating what taking down a botnet really means,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtd25Kc0YxQTMzTV81aENpQlJ6Z3JybXdQU0NNQk5xM2hPaDByZW95STJhRGx5SzVTRG95ZVNfbVNWUzdwTUF1NE42R3dmam43S3UtQkxuWXhZUnZNZXR4Rkl5SXQ4OTFQR2pDMFpiVmV1YnM9

consciousness does reside in the brain if brain function ceases your consciousness is no longer there at least not is your body you can make a case about human souls or the afterlife since theres no way to disprove those so consciousness may continue after death but it is no longer tied to the body but as far as we know consciousness does reside in the brain while the brain is alive,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtT2tkSGRka1RHVXVjUlVBUklaTDVSOTNtN2drMzFmOW52UHN6a1psdEVjdklBM0Zxa3lYcHNONzhiZWxNV1YzUlBSaUJyS1NJSVg2Y0lQUm9ydGcxV0E9PQ==
thats a narrow view ignoring centuries of philosophical thought on the matter many cultures and intellectual traditions have explored the idea of consciousness existing beyond the physical brain which your argument completely disregards you suggest that consciousness either resides in the brain or continues in some form after death however there might be other explanations such as consciousness being a fundamental aspect of the universe not limited to living beings,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtOG1xZTBxZjQwd0JyMTM5V19kQ0pHSlY5ZE1iVlR1bERFMUhzWDdCR0NWT2hEZWhmSEhFWm12djR3aFQ5cDQzalZmekhGMWdVSDVCWnBKTzlQVlMzQWVzYVRONnJ4X1Zfb2w5bklzdkUxN0E9

thats a philosophical argument im solely speaking based on the observed facts that science can confirm at the moment we have no way of knowing for sure if consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe so it isnt really a useful consideration for medical studies which have to have observable results its a limitation of the field im also not arguing that philosophy shouldnt consider it or that it wont ever be scientifically observable but as it stands with our modern understanding consciousness does reside within the brain so a cryogenically preserved brain where all the cells die before or during the freezing process cannot then be revived and made to hold consciousness,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtNEVvZXNRUzctMXZDTDZmR2x0RV9yV3pjMjFEaHlBcUV2Nlk5UWhFNjFYejYwTEdoSm54dXNjRHRyX1JjYUJ6dVpaRWp6NnM0YnRpUXBRRkhkNXk5MFE9PQ==

this hasnt even started clinical trials also most cartilage loss in the knee presents as tears rather than an ocd lesion this is a very narrow patient base that this will affect and it is nowhere near being considered for the general population its fun to think about but it doesnt seem all that widely applicable also it wouldnt necessarily prevent the need for a knee replacement as this only plugs a hole of cartilage loss the cartilage around the plug can still degenerate,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuTWJvcnJ1NGlPcE1ad3pSN3M0M21famRpRC1UUzdZM1ZXUUFjN0lJZG5QZWcwNkJiUnp0blBYWk1JUEc0SWZ4UE5VUlBFTzFjV2lLN2dIWGdtWkRSY0E9PQ==

this i scrolled to through every comment here and the last one finally addresses the root cause i frequently have patients brag to me about their bionic joints or stents or whatever i cringe hard because so much of this is just from obesity we dont need to keep reinventing expensive implants so that companies with their reps can make more money we do these procedures because we overeat calories i dont know the exact percentage maybe an orthopod can chime in probably <number> of knee replacements wouldnt have to happen if we could just eat a reasonable number of calories we complain about expensive health care in usa but we dont question subsidizing <cur><number> surgeries that are mostly avoidable it doesnt make sense for healthy weightnonsmokers to pay the same for insurance as people who chose dangerous lifestyles vote for usolodolo in <number> i would make generic blood pressure pills insulin and diabetes pills free for all americans create a modest obesity health insurance tax starting three years from now these changes alone would reduce knee replacements coronary artery disease interventions dialysisesrd etc immensely it would probably pay for itself x over within a decade its insanity to keep addressing symptoms without talking about the causes while also punishing those who dont contribute to the epidemic,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZHFwQVEwa1RWeW5EMHRkdTgzVk85TzNtSFFkVXpyNk1vOFdHU2VuWWFxVEliZTdkUEVJT0xuNEhMVlJlb3E1QWRJMTFFNHF4cWpwV1p5WWRsdXVqQnc9PQ==

worked on this in college back in <number> was fascinating stuff really the idea then at least was that you could d print a bioscaffold with nutrient rich growth media and then plant the recipients cartilage stem cells onto it where they would consumereplace the structure as they proliferated once fully developed you would essentially have a cartilage plug you could implant into the joint replacing old worn out cartilage and giving the patient a new kneeelbowhip etc,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYnlKa3VES0JINk9XOTI0ZGdTUkRDVGJ3YWJLM1BWTV9nX2F5U0xSS1h1MXEybmxJR3l3SUZzdVU3M2c2VEoxN1NGZnZFQlRhSDJoTVRnMGdHYW5feUE9PQ==

well it was part of their big push until fukushima i also think solar wind are great but they are only more economical so long as they are a smaller part of the energy mix as soon as we reach a threshold where they produce more energy than we need in a small period of time then they stop being cheap beyond that we need energy storage and as soon as thats thrown in the mix then solar becomes the single most expensive form of energy we have available wind fares better due to being able to produce at any point in the day but no matter how hard we try were not going to get solar production up and running at pm hell the effort it takes to get solar to make an impact in most of the worlds economies for half the year is utterly silly hence a solar panel is cheap going full renewable is the single most expensive option we currently have,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwdnc4Y2kxNm53SnhtTkIyOWJrRF9Id2I0M0tKX3BYN3RlLS1TOWstVGNNUTE2T1lHTXhRSTFBM3NNZUZyUEFjS2p0bDg2VVhmdmx6YV9TMnktT1RWV3lPWnJXQUV1MFpKR0RFZmc5djNhVjA9

im talking about asia and africa in this example digging a well or trucking water in is gonna be relatively cheap everywhere if you cant truck in or fly in digging equipment imagine how more expensive would be setting up solar panels or constructing a desalination plant i have only seen a single device that could somehow work but still requires more than digging a well and that is microhydrokinetic water turbine it provides power which helps quite a lot with various things also argument for me being right is because in the article the literal creator of the machine said she does not think this machine will see widespread use as it is to expensive they currently only use it in government buildings and in schools for emergency use during drought this is literally solution for the top <number> of people,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2MDZYX1FJbWNTaXgwa1d1Nlo5SW5lWm45ZnlaZXZLQ1RYSXRSb2VBV2tMLTJVWFd0RTAtVFhlYzVIWVV3ZU5fQ1dsUTNveXVBNWdKTjg4Q2J4cGlMT2c9PQ==

probably highly depends on the location on extremely remote areas or in place with no road it might be cheaper than trucking but then its not cheap its just cheaper than trucking in water what we want is a tech that can be universally used and is cheaper than current solutions it seems like all current solutions either require large amount of infrastructure or require a lot of power both of those reasons are why there is no water in the first place as there exist places that are as dry as that but have running tap water thanks to desalination plants a lot of middle eastern countries get more than <number> of their water from desalination the problem is that there are still places in africa that dont have a lot of economic development and the most successful solution so far has been improvement of economy not some wonder tech if you look at poverty rates in africa they have been plummeting and that reflected directly in their access to water,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UXFHeGNvYzFsS0p2VF9OTU82d2JmVjgzVHlGTzYyTFRHajZzZklqNVJ1aFhjeDBnZ1BoWmNZWHg3MW80YmRWSEg0VjVLalREeGM3TWYyTTRNLXFwdGc9PQ==

the problem is you need relative moisture to pull out of the air either you live near water and this thing pulls the evaporated water out of the air or maybe you get a little after rain but otherwise you have dry air and there is no moisture to pull there is no tech that breaks physics without a thousand researchers scrambling to verify and succeeding or failing and succeeding makes waves in even normie media the thing people always forget to mention with these like magic techs the water does actually have to come from somewhere water wont be in the air if there is no body of water near by evaporating now could this work in areas that have large amounts of undrinkable water and high humidity probably its just a dehumidifier and ideally it is actually efficient but you can already buy little plastic boxes that do this with zero energy input<url> but the magic camp always advertise it disingenuously the life straw is a much better cheaper and proven way to drink undrinkable water a dehumidifier will do nothing in an arid area no matter how efficient it is edit grammar edit the article mentions its in a humid environment thats good literally the only place this could work that good news,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2aXVvRDY4UmtJQ1BkNEtkUGtFRGh3aGsydERDenN6MVVuSnJDNVVnVnpCSGNfMVJONl93d09FR3M5dEpmMEhncTR5b21DNmFkZFBfMlp6NTFQc0FqRmc9PQ==

to be fair most hvac professionals i have encountered dont understand coefficient of performance either my moms florida system is electric resistance heating with no heat pump capability because the installation guy told her its another <cur><number> for the heat pump version and the heat pump wont work when it gets cold anyway an extra <cur><number> on a <cur><number> <number> seer <number> ton system in palm beach county florida she would have saved that <cur><number> back inside a year the cop on that bad boy is above <number> on the coldest day of the year at that house electric resistance heating is the second most expensive way to heat that there is beaten only by a bonfire made of cash using water as a heat exchanger is good but you can do basically the same thing with a deep hole in the ground and a long pipe loop running down and back up a ground coupled heat pump is very efficient,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3aXZPSHJaWFA3T3JyZUVLcnJMdUhtRmVNVy1zVDY2bFgtaHg3Wi1IX25lSnEzNXJlRnVUN2piUzRETGNfM1hTcXY2aFY1WXhfZmZpVlJ2UUVhc0lhQXc9PQ==

im guessing most people cant get their head around how you can put energy into a system and get more out basically you cant but heat pumps move energy around most people understand how a fridge moves energy from inside cools and cools dumps the excess heat out the back via the radiator coils this is exactly that electricity is used to move energy from one source and dump that heat into another in the energy equation the coldhot sources balance out ie you take kj of energy out of the water and it get colder push it to air and it get kj hotter if then transport of that energy only costs j running compressor you get <number> times the energy efficiency,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NGZmdkFROWpPY2pONUxkYU5GRDJldFV2TktncEhEU3g2X1BwNlJSRUlrVlM5T29Hdk5JeDI4SDlqY3VFRmxEUGlLVE00MzdKYW1jczR0WXQ4WHlSdUE9PQ==

yeah the water doesnt just disappear of course in most models theres a condensate tank which slides out and you can either empty it manually every few loads or attach a drain hose to the back so its more convenient if you put it in a place with a sewer hookup or maybe grey water if youre fancy but its not a requirement you just need power and of course some ventilation since the machine will get warm but nothing like the requirements of a vented dryer also since they use so much less power you can usually connect them to a normal plug,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4dTVYMjJwM0JZbWlnbG9WR19RR3ZOajNydTJWOVNra0xudFhkTnQwanIybGV2MG9RZG40bGw2UXZjb1M2U0xPM2JZMXlrV0xtY0hBbUJkRW52dUl0Y0QtRkt3bFp0RDlldWVnUEQ3VmNKd0k9

you can capture it but thats just half the problem where do you store all that co the carbon dioxide excess is around <number> of our atmosphere thats a lot underground isnt an answer unfortunately the volume of empty reservoirs and mines available for storage is a fraction of the volume we need what we really need is a cheap way to turn this concentrated co into carbon which we can then store i think the most realistic way to go about this is to capture co at the source like at steel mills and smelters that use carbon as a reductant and reuse the capture add biological carbon like wood chips commonly used for ferroalloys for instance and youll have excess carbon you can store and you also have an economic incentive which helps smooth things along of course all progress is good progress im just doubtful that this will lead anywhere,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4Tk9qVE1RUW1iV3JEeXZWazVuVU5RcTlON0YycUZSZFlzSDBtOWxGUXdZTGg0RDZtQUNqRC1kSWlqTmlsTmRmSFF6alhySWdaRFEwcXk5MWZkenhGQVE9PQ==

there is still a major problem though thermodynamically speaking it is exceptionally hard and expensive to take co gas from the atmosphere and turn it into anything elsesolid liquid compressed gas something on the order of magnitude of at least the same amount of energy you gained from burning the fuel which released that co in the first place basically we will have to offset all of our current energy sources that produce co with at minimum an equivalent amountin energetic production of infrastructure dedicated to powering carbon capture systems to hit net zero this does nothing to address legacy carbon which was there before these systems were constructed that would require additional energy production solely dedicated to such facilities its a difficult problem because of the basic thermodynamic reality of taking a ppm concentration gas from a complex and uneven mixture and storing it as either a pure compressed gas or compressing it into a pure liquid or solid form its going to require a significant amount of energy infrastructure which will not give tangible observable benefits to people for decades as the goal is not only net zero but reducing the amount weve already put in the atmosphere the energy made by the facilities is dedicated to an uneconomical task my personal bet is that its going to require significant political will for this infrastructure to be built at the scale required to begin to reverse the influx of co into the atmosphere caused by human activity im willing to bet that this political will wont be present for another few decades a large chunk of people are stubborn and dont want their tax dollars going to something they cant see any benefits of it will likely take a significant migrant crisis in much of the developed world with mass graves needing to be dug for victims of extreme inclement weather caused climate change for there to be the political will necessary to do anything substantial about it,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eVg4VS1udDlaaUluMEZXeHNpTldBWkc4N2wwNzNPT0Fual9QSmd1RzlFQUIxcDllNzRlTHpQaGw4eTc2TTFvM3Y4UVR0TW54ZzhzWEVOMWMzcFNoblE9PQ==
the world has greater than <number> gt<url> of co storage capacity underground some of this is in the form of depleted oil and gas fields but the vast majority is in saline aquifers this is far in excess of the amount of co we might need to store in the s the world emitted an estimated <number> gtcoeq<url> most of which was from co but methane and refrigerants also contributed significantly so the amount of co is more in the ballpark of <number> gt if we continued to emit co at the current rate we could potentially store it in geological formations for two and half centuries that said we dont expect our emissions to remain at this rate due to other decarbonisation efforts like renewable electrification which allow for a rapid reduction in emissions the ieas sustainable development scenario estimated that we would need to store ~<number> gt of co<url> over the next fifty years though the actual number may end up being higher depending on the path the world takes but still well within the storage budget we can confidently say that theres more capacity for co storage in the subsurface alone to meet the worlds needs many times over,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4TWJlWWM4bm94cG1mRVdReE82MkNkTXVmalk5cUl4bmVsY0FjMnNZV0JpLXNFZnhUTUhRWm5qdzRlNjIyekwwS2Q5Q0lVRVQyeHd4QUNtQUNld3R2Ymc9PQ==

youve pretty much got it the general process is just carbonization aka heating up a carbon based material to really high temps in an atmosphere void of oxygen typically nitrogen or argon the end result you just crush up and mix it into your electrode slurry for use as the active material just about any form of carbon will work for the anode some are better or worse than others and this is due to the other additives that come naturally from your base material choice commercially mcmb is used a lot i did research into this sort of stuff during my undergrad for li ion and we had used this process for a wide range of things from powders to use in electrodes soybeans and corn husks also work well for this graphene production was a whole can of worms and making flexible mats for the electrode wasnt trying to take away from the benefit of repurposing waste material but just that its sort of click baity considering how common it is,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5SXBLdktOMVZWbG5PY0lPWmJkMjE3Vm9uYnlJMEE1QkFJOEN6WlNPcmhPYWhqRWgwaXRvS29HMXdvZi1tbVBpNXFYOXNuaXNsSmVXODZXVTh5bWtaSGRKVHoyWldHenZ1dE1qdmRFNXBVdDQ9

inspections its not unheard of to use ultrasound xrays ct scans and similar to get a look inside items without having to open them up for situations where its difficult to nondestructively dismantle the object or where youre specifically trying to verify what its like when assembled so opening it would defeat the purpose a tool like this could join those other techniques in situations like quality control of manufactured items inspection of machinery and installed equipment security inspection of parcels and mail examination of historical artifacts locating studs wires pipes etc without damaging wallpaper or plasterboard possibly imaging things beneath the skin for medical purposes theres a lot of possible uses of course there are also nefarious applications for one i just mentioned inspecting mail but of course it could also let anyone who handled your mail read its contents which is a criminal offence in many places and do so undetectably and without actually opening it the ramifications of a smartphone camera that can see through clothes are also pretty horrifying as with many recent technical advances we could get some great benefits from this so long as its handled responsibly and some bad actors dont spoil it for the rest of us i guess well see how that pans out,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6bkxhUTVOODFqdWJKSFREdlc1NmFNMlJlX00zaEZkLUlabUpENXZZRFZFSWI0SURGYWJlU0N2MFZ1ejB5aEwxRWg4MVVRM1ZBS01VM1VQRGR6QTZ6elE9PQ==

civil engineering perspective this is an interesting innovation but it has a long ways to go before it is actually viable this is considering a mixture of water cement and their special conductive ingredient this mixture is not concrete it is mortar it has no real weight bearing capacity and at that they mention it is slightly weaker than regular mortar i would venture to guess that by the time the aggregate sand cement and their additive is together it will either be too weak as a material structurally or not conductive enough it will also need to go through extensive testing and long term testing to know the efficacy does it degrade over time does it create a byproduct what is the efficiency over time all of these things are possible to work through but it will be years before it is acceptable in county state and federal building standards very cool to see the innovation though,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6NXV5TzZPVll2bHoxbW5ON0lUZ1RsVmd0SUxNTzNNZ0R4dnhBOWp1WGpWRGFaT1dPXzdhU2l1enRJSGJBblhTd0hmXzRvVlphVEdNZHNBSGptUTNlX1NsQnhCbUtqa1B4cnNhLWs5YmpVS1k9

thats just not true most of what you said is true but the industry is very quickly moving to a type l cement that has less than half the footprint of uncut portland so the industry is very much reducing its footprint and in many areas of the country like mine for example this is the only type available it has some drawbacks for sure early strength is much lower and takes a few days to catch up or lots of costly admix accelerant not to mention the cement is more expensive despite being cheaper to make probably some price collusion reason despite those the industry is absolutely forcing it for the reduced carbon footprint,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ekEtZE9KaE02TG04V0szUEI5RG1mOGNJQVNmY25Kc1BCWXZoaUZrbzdSWkxzR2VyQzFzb2hDa3hDbmNWazNnVkFtTjY2c3pOWkNIR3JnSW8tb0xiekE9PQ==

because he is a spec writer obviously s people are misinterpreting what the global current of cement clinker development is as what the western world or various other metropolitan localities are demanding for concrete performance and requirements meaning that the usa in certain areas are demanding it but were still producing a shit ton of cement are you seeing this on usa federal specs in general and if so what type of alternative cemeticious materials are you seeing fly ash geopolymers i had performed a few years worth of testing as a grad and undergrad and was rather obsessed with geopolymer uses for structural purposes,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2N3NGUGZVYVdSWlctaVp3VDJ4SnRtaEZCdTBkTDhicHhpMUNVSlNxRDc3RXdjZXNpcm85aXlvV2JCa0Y5dmZjRGc2VUZSOW5xSVlRTVdJZUxQUUJ4VXc9PQ==

thats a reasonable criticism of at least the headline however car battery is overlyspecific the water in big leadacid batteries is easy to notice because you can sometimes hear it sloshing when you move the battery and because on the vented types you actually have to top up the water but almost all batteries in current use involve electrolytes dissolved in a solvent which may or may not be water depending on the chemistry used its just a bit less noticeable when <number> theyre totally sealed and <number> the liquid is contained in something like a paste or a roll of wet paper instead of big sloshing tank so what does make the thing in this article different from existing liquid batteries quite simply its that theyre not really talking about a battery as the term is normally understood when this article say liquid battery its just talking about a fuel tank this is part of a trend in journalism thats been going on as long as the hydrogen economy hype has since a fuel cell converts chemical energy to electrical energy the combination of a fuel cell and a fuel tank gets referred to as a battery,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2cTQzREwtRHVHcXVhSDUxb3Roclk3TU1jZUZpb3JXV3RXS0JmeDlQRkZucUdKNzVMWkxhSFJWZGVEdFRNOVZqdGdRczVYc0ppV2JiZXFIZWhDdWltdHc9PQ==

these are literally just cem iiiiii types of mixes where a part of portland cement is replaced with supplementary cementitious materials like bfs or fly ash in this case plc with limestone the vast majority of the binder mix is still portland cement i wouldnt call plc green cement any more than i would call cem iiiiii green i think cem iii requires only <number> portland cement as an example for scms utilizing bfs or fly ash the more you add the slower the activation until you arrive at a point where it simply is too slow to fit into any reasonably concrete workflow instead of having to wait d for full compressive strength you have to wait <number> days thats where the activators come into play but they are not cheap and fairly significant amounts of them are required as opposed to admixtures which are just small additions additionally the exact composition and amount of activator can be very specific so just coming up with a recipe that works requires rd that is way beyond the means of any typical concrete factory,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2d3VGZ1pyNDhadV8wN2tIWkZIbWNBdlg4bXlaY3FvZnAwRlVYVzJPZTF1VWM5X3RzeHZONldCclMyMTZGUVJmOEVMVk4zdXJqRzJpWWF2V1RCSHY4OWc9PQ==

i think you can have some cost savings from doing that but the costs are still high at least high enough to keep the current speed of solar rollout china is doing mass industrial rollout of solar just like you are saying and its likely why they are ahead of us in terms of solar but to move to sustainable energy we need savings to be much bigger and vast majority of those savings is in the installation costs,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Y1Y1dlFzWmtORFprNmNubjVQYkw2V3J1Y1dBOW8zbXNtazNuTjNfa2dvMjJCcUpZdTM4QjRvMDZSamlYanl2UTJFQ01ub09YVDU0OEJERmpZNHA0V0E9PQ==
i kind of disagree with you there rollout would be quicker if the west was buying panels from china but both the us and the eu have protectionist clauses in the green deals that incentivise local production the problem being the supply is not able to keep up with demand and the panels cannot be produced as quickly because we were slow to subsidise the industry ground installation is pretty cheap its basic stuff like mounting brackets and wiring installation costs are ballooned by permits and application processes though because these can be a bit tedious in the west and there is a lot of politics that slow the processes this is another problem china doesnt have,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MFZaX3g0dFc0emJNSWdRcXN3TlU5Mjl4SFA0dXdsRUVTZFVuSzdidVF4YTJWSnN0YmpUaDRVMDlsLXJVeE00VHZEZ2xIeG9lREQ5RmdvVWhnR2xXQmc9PQ==

i dont think so it might save few percent but you still have to install inverter wiring and just time to install just physical installation of the panels themselves is probably small part of installing your panels but maybe im wrong someone smarter than me should run those costs and check but this was always my understanding and its why solar city planned to do to save on things different than the panels themselves,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3cmxVazE4a2tIWndxY095M1ZiZWVSMzJOVzd0Q2p6YUJZcXJRbWk1V2s0OFJmVXgwRWlnT2FObFh5YkNGaFVkWFZnSzVUcWg5a2lhV0d0cjlBM0wxMnc9PQ==
from what i remember this has everything to do with tariffs the us govt puts heavy tariffs on the worlds largest provider of solar panels china so people in the us have to jump through hoops and basically have quite a bit of disposable income to pay for panels and installation costs are coming down but not enough for people to say yeah lets get some solar not to mention the fact that our grid is shit so even if everyone decided to get solar our power infrastructure may not handle it well love it here s,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3cHozWUZjS21oU0I5YjJKQUxyQmczeF9SN09FcXo5WVpJTlFpMnlUdlFRRENLNTBEM3hGd2tfVFVUeU9tckhzWXpMbWNZNkJCc21lelBneksxWV81ckE9PQ==

honestly i dont even care for individual ownership im fine with everyones solar going back to the grid for collective generation i personally think thats the best option because not everyone is handy enough to manage their own solar setup plus municipal management will be easier with scale youre absolutely right though the utility companies dont want to give up their existing investments because theyre profit driven and the margins are pretty low in the first place our mode of energy generation and management is bull and its creating more problems than solving,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3cWNnb3pyNFhmZHhmZ2ZmT3BYbDQ4cERzWHJmdVZfLWRvanpTV1ZwdTVuUUk1MUFuekN5TUVGeGVwR2J0MHJ6enZPa3lIZ3I0aFZNWTJOX2g5cHVsaXc9PQ==

in australia typically most batteries are <number> year warranty but supplyinstall costs mean the battery takes ish years to pay off its very dependent on use as well though from what ive seen most warranties are also limited to a given amount of power throughput eg max mwh so if youre doing a lot of chargedischarge through the day you wont get to the <number> years similar to a car warranty being whatever comes first of <number> years or <number>km for now batteries on an individual house scale generally arent cost effective here,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3WG9pTHF4NnFqSzhFam9LZXNGOXc4amNFNFI2V0dZbmRvaWhxbFhac0dGR3FubTBlajBsczdoTlU0UFlzUDh1czUzSjZGOXI2bU1XMGtBOTBuWFFwSGc9PQ==

i guess it depends on the scale and the workload youre about to run you can cluster the cerebras systems too so you can create quite large deployments like with dgx though the limitation with any dgx system is going to be both the interconnect and gpu memory both of which arent as big of an issue with the wse systems but also cheapness is relative and dependent on metrics wse might be cheaper in terms of rack space and power consumption if those are metrics you care about where as gpu cluster might be cheaper if you care more about the capex side and the gpus are only half of the equation the other is your storage systems,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3ZnYwbEdGY2c0OTM1QUpxUXVGT0tYUTUzSzhmWURCV3ZNb1Y1TTVJSWwwcGVXM1ZyRlEycU5rYU9HV1dUa243ZnE1YldVT19LbEk3dW9qaEJHMnEwcVE9PQ==

in fact chatgpt responded to give me a sustainable model for solving climate change within <number> years with addressing climate change comprehensively within a decade requires a multifaceted approach and global cooperation heres a sustainable model rapid transition to renewable energy shift subsidies and investments from fossil fuels to renewable sources like solar wind and hydro governments should set ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption and incentivize private sector involvement energy efficiency implement strict efficiency standards for buildings appliances and transportation to reduce energy demand encourage retrofitting of existing infrastructure to improve efficiency carbon pricing implement carbon pricing mechanisms such as carbon taxes or capandtrade systems to incentivize emissions reductions and fund climate initiatives reforestation and land use protect and restore forests wetlands and other natural carbon sinks promote sustainable land management practices to enhance carbon sequestration electrification of transportation accelerate the transition to electric vehicles evs through subsidies infrastructure development charging stations and incentives for consumers and manufacturers circular economy promote recycling reuse and waste reduction to minimize resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with production climate resilience and adaptation invest in infrastructure and policies that build resilience to climate impacts like extreme weather events sealevel rise and food security challenges education and awareness foster public awareness and education on climate change impacts and solutions empower communities to take action and support climatefriendly behaviors international cooperation strengthen international agreements like the paris agreement ensuring commitments are met and scaled up over time collaborate on technology transfer and financial support for developing countries innovation and research increase funding for clean energy research development of carbon capture technologies and other innovative solutions to accelerate the transition to a lowcarbon economy this model integrates immediate action with longterm strategies emphasizing the need for systemic changes across all sectors of society and the economy success depends on political will technological innovation and sustained public engagement at local national and global levels so point proven,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4X216SzdiMVhCMTJILW1DaFZVNTRjTXUwSWsxeG5jQ25Db0p6S1JSRTByenVaQ1UxcC1kZUl6cm9FczFHLUFOWU5Bc3hKMmJxLVczMVBSXzlZbW90MHc9PQ==

i almost wish there were physical robots that could just veto that decision to make examples of the execs for us it really would help solve the problem almost overnight think about it these people dont blink an eye at killing thousands corrupting the future of humanity a whole just for the profit on their already temporary lives what benefit does their existence provide humanity seriously asking do you actually have a serious answer id love to know for as long as they continue to be allowed to operate as they are they only cause the acceleration of the destruction of our entire species theyre a virus they are cancer and they will never learn even if they stopped today that could never undo the damage theyve done and what do we do with virii or cancer usually out of necessity  if a robot decided what you stated was necessary id breathe a sigh of relief and probably go back to church because id be inclined to believe there is a god out there who is just and cares about our future this would not be a failure of design it would go a long fcking way to solving the problem and thats not really up for debate the real shocker is why humanity somehow hasnt collectively figured out that we need to lock up these sacks of sadly living sht already or happily worse you know capital punishment is still a thing in a lot of states and countries and theres not one serial killer in history who has been executed who has murdered more individuals than most of these execs  like whats actually wrong with the world where these men lets be honest <number> men walk free,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4aFA0Y3BGd1ZQUktDLWtBNUcyaVlRdVJJSXhtbTIzdjNpY0g5b09XaXVRMTNVWmk4dV8yTlllMkdlZ2JaU1hmSjlYdzNTaE5FYlpfNXk3Y1BGVV93WkE9PQ==

to elaborate interestingly openais scalability is limited by literal amounts of energy so recently data centers and the infrastructure for energy companies that power them have been hot investments and have literally needed to increase their physical footprint however more energy is not the only solution more computing is another solution if more computation multitudes more can happen using the same energy suddenly the approach to scaling outward is not through building out more data centers or more energy systems but by leveraging more quantum computers to compute more efficiently this is relatively well known market trend for anyone who is invested in current ai technology like nvda or quantum computing investments like ibm or ionq,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4elluRHV2aU45dTZTcksydmdoZXI2bERwMGJ5eWhKR2ZtVHVTbnFLbG1VQlhneDluNnNJZHNudHZ6bWo2aUxrZUd3UW51cldCS2h5djdmV19JbjJBMEE9PQ==

very cool the findings of this study emphasize that prominent anomalies in the earthquake precursors in a time interval of about <number> days before the earthquake first in the lithosphere and then in the upper layers ie in the atmosphere and ionosphere respectively are observed the study concludes of course this is still just a hypothesis based on looking back at one quake so far the researchers will need to analyze data from many more events across different regions to see if laic pans out as a reliable precursor system if the laic theory holds water we could be looking at a whole new ballgame for earthquake early warning capabilities for areas sitting squarely on top of active faults that kind of extra lead time could make all the difference in saving lives,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDYzJvT1BfdnFBWVVDZVo4djdBakFKZEtZd0VKMVl0Wk13S1RkVlJFU0hNZkM0QXJLa0RpbHY0clJsVFpIZ3RSaWRPU2Q0UV9qc2p6Y3JiMWVadDEtbERSRVdMWUJLa3FPLVlKcWJEbGY0dkU9

yes language changes and non logical uses of language pop up idioms exist i understand how language works what doesnt change is the idea of what constitutes a definition when the changing of vernacular is not driven by necessity for more definition then its driven by the misconception of what the definition is of the words that are being used misusing a term over and over doesnt make it right it doesnt matter how popular misusing a concept becomes its still a misguided concept and now everyone using that term figuratively seems like a total fucking dipshit to anyone with half a brain ai is not a figurative term its not an idiom its a specific thing its not a vague concept or an undefined whimsical idea to just attach to whatever because people are gullible morons its like if i started calling everything a computer im going to go drive my computer to work and then im going to use my computer then at lunch ill open my computer and then use my computer a while longer before driving my computer home to my computer where i live well all those things have a computer that controls them so theyre all ok to just refer to as computers because thats not confusing or a stupid use of language when perfectly good words already exist to describe the thing im usinglike a car or a llm or a computer calling a hippopotamus a whale is not accurate even if they did eventually evolve into whales theyre not the same thing and conflating them just makes you look ignorant defending ignorance is super extra ignorant pretending like ignorance is how our language evolves is absolutely next level bonkers ignorant,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQXVTelgtV2Zwd2trWllfLTBUa0RkREVYeDdIVU51ZFNpMkpqa1pYU1FmVEpjN084SmtnZl9kcHFtLVJ2Z1hDMFpFYjI2eDRISzMwMXJTT29uNGpfaWc9PQ==

that still wouldnt be sufficient to overcome the horrific energy density except in evs where the battery makes up around <number> or less of the curb weight even then thats probably still too high without significant improvements in the energy density of it the structural weight of a modern vehicle is simply not high enough to store a sufficient amount of energy using this material alone not if you want to maintain anywhere near the same range to me its purpose should either be as a small weight saver by reducing some of the load on the battery or as a range extender by providing a small amount of extra capacity for no weight penalty,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV01OQWpkVGR4bmxxLTc1RnZpWTlGNDRkSzNJbG1mVlpNeVRCb1oycm9ManBtTllDQVNBdTVtNnphMzRVUHRPZTFYRjBpbjRSWW9iaFlFV1B6Q3lpMFE9PQ==

it would still need more than the structural weight of a modern vehicle can provide unless the battery makes up a tiny fraction <<number><number> of the vehicles curb weight if they can improve the energy density sufficiently then this is no longer the case but as of this moment its far too low to maintain anywhere near the same range,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNVE0MDdEMFR6TmR3Z3RMX3FBVXNLZ3l5REF4UzNGX2hoTEdfbWNUMVRGNHNGa1U4TGt2N1Bja3VmY1J1cWFQcU85cFMtNk5HOTRFaUx2RmRneER2NVE9PQ==

what would be the point of adding more of this than required for structural considerations if it has a lower energy density than conventional liion batteries its just a shittier battery at that point rather than a clever way to increase energy capacity without adding to the weight i did a project in an optimization class i took during my masters on the trade space for an all electric aircraft the energy density of this is so low as to essentially not be worth the effort,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZS0RxbU1adFBWdi14SDdINzJEZ0xmUlJLX2JpazlZTVhRSEhxTk5ycmEzT3c1eVdTSmNNV0VET1RLek5xeGdTcnlEb3JLVTNpQk1zVHd6dFVqaWppX1E9PQ==

the point is you do away with the weight of the traditional batteries if and only if you can substitute it with the larger but structural battery frame that would have been used in traditional frames anyway even if its a shittier battery if it can provide enough power as a whole with quantity is a quality of its own designs then it can substitute for the traditional variant kinda like how a battery pack of aa can substitute for a dedicated specialist single large battery and the cost savings in weight cant be ignored here,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTG5HLXlIckIzRDZrOWowZkY3WHNub2hieFktanYta01aUnRkVW5qZkJqem0xNEVLeFItRGNvOU13S1U1bGdBcEs0eUppLU0zQTgxOVlmRWJseC1zaTVLV0hrZjRTLWkzZW4yWThlMzJMM2c9

in engineering the weight of each component is considered by how much weight it adds to the overall build as this battery not only eliminates the need for a heavy battery block it even replaces structural components with a lighter alternative thus in a technical engineering sense the carbon fiber battery is literally negative weight thus weightless remember this is a science sub expect technical terms not everything here is going to be written for a th grader,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNU5Ed2FWcFlETGVRdHBNRGprY1FQVnd0YWxsMGRTcDdGV3htVjA5LXk0WFhILXpOS3RhT1FRcFIybTlsQmk0Q2Z5eENBRGxYX0d0clNtWVJ5cGJIV1E9PQ==

not sure specifically about using adhesive over mortar for stone work but yeah adhesive is used in construction all the time even for structural elements oftentimes to supply extra strength or to bond together materials that would otherwise be hard to join together adhesives of this nature can actually be incredibly strong so its not as scary as it sounds its not like they are using elmers glue sticks here,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadi0tYURBSU1SQy1DaXFMeDUzaE9ta2F0dW1HMHVZdlRIc2lWNkctSmhRZXkzbFdNaFJjYkRSa1dWWkZGblJxSEczSURST2EwOFZQOWJmRFE3UW9lN1E9PQ==

i dont know how to say this any clearer with the specific energy given in the article it is not capable of being a complete replacement for a regular battery there is not a sufficient amount of structural mass in a modern car to maintain the same energy capacity or a similar energymass ratio without a significant boost in the amount of energy that this carbon fiber can store per unit of mass once all of the available structural mass has been converted to this you will still need a battery in order maintain anywhere near the same range because as i said the carbon fiber cant store a sufficient amount of energy adding more of it beyond replaced structural mass is pointless as its just a shittier and more expensive battery,r/tech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNW1GRWxZMzVMb0hZWG1Ec1Q3MTdsbm4wVV9tbDBZeElKUU13RTZNbDFXOE5XTDZYZTdqeEZHdFFnSE5qeTljT3JBdE1tcm4yTmRqY0xxSEVXY0dKSmc9PQ==
