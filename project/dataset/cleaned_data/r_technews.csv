security is tightened appropriately haha u almost had me while white hats are good companies very rarely fix the issues thoroughly which is why we continue to watch our data being leaked repeatedly its cheaper to pay for pr after a hack than purchase and maintain the security infrastructure daily furthermore if the data was stolen and placed on another server not owned by att then att has no authority to break into said server to delete it unless the owner of that server has given them explicit permission to do so hacking back isnt exactly legal used to work ir we absolutely were not allowed to hack back once we discovered who it may have been lol i believe the only hackers who have legal authority to hack back are funded by nation states aka the govt,r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhc2ZjUm0zNjhrUU1ienZLV3FwcENjNmZvOUtVTUkwZ0N2V1NuYlpMOEtTcXV4d2hXTDV1QkZkWlEwWGhLRFhlbjNMcWQ5WW9yU2x4Ym5lV1l1TFAyYmc9PQ==

again extrapolating is useful but extrapolating too far is passing bullshit as facts yes gpt is good yes the average current lines of work is <number> however in the real world there are things called backlogs of work and allot of feature requests and improvements are ignored by the fuck ton of bugs if ai can help developers to resolve this list of bugs this frees up developers to actually address feature requests and improvements in the near future the best company wont be the one that can shit out the most code but the ones that provide the best user experience like you said current lines of code is lines that means you could have ai helping a team quickly find and resolve bugs and cybersecurity holes again software engineering isnt just coding,r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaWFKSXBzRHAtb2xWS2JoOFpsWWthUlBaVGk5TjBhVnBrcGZvTmFOOUJ0Z0VwZUdTekdKS0Uxc2E1bHEtbGt1Wk9IQVd0VVFZb004TmRUTEkyTnJZcVJXQURxMWJkeVRpMlhvcHNsQVd2dlE9

its definitely more terrifying to imagine how a human could use a sufficiently advanced system one that is controllable in significant measure it could make horrors possible mass horrors its even terrifying now to imagine how the existing models in all their different modalities could be used and applied at the same time its not more terrifying than any other recent invention of war the atomic bomb and their pastcurrent quantities biological warfare and genocidal practices for some reason i refuse to be afraid of this despite knowing they will be used in some manner of wrong if they will be weapons then let the cool heads run them the same that had the patience not to hit the nuclear buttons during false alarms weve been smart enough to make it this far although will our arrogance prevent us from going any farther,r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbmhjZDQtTUppanpULVFqMnV6LUR1V2pWenBUTlZaSEdxX05YWEtxN1g2Sk5HOE1qMmszWE1mSXpNbkpWSnZIN0h6NndsaUcyQ0ZXM1hzd3lJdS1PRFE9PQ==

its absolutely not a good thing if this doesnt settle out of court and verizon loses if the record labels lawsuit succeeds it opens the door to isps being required to actively monitor your connection and disconnect you if you do anything that could infringe on the rights of others its a huge overreach of the isps authority to monitor and forcibly restrict access to resources simply because they might find them disagreeable or opens them to liability we noticed you watch a lot of parody channels on youtube but company y is claiming that infringes on their rights were going to shut off your access to the internet since we dont want to be sued have a nice day a future call from your isp this would be like your power company shutting off your power because you used electricity to copy a bluray and the movie company said the power company was responsible for promoting the behavior by providing electricity,r/technews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLUkxUGVKaUxDaHJNM1p3NDRFcGVLWkhmcjdmVndUUGJXVTg1RDRDdXFCSmdtanNzUWNJT1VLNXpFRUNjRGlLem9CQmswRUt1bl9JbURVNEdVa25OQ3c9PQ==
