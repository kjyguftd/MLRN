this bit specifies the shape of the data going into your model an image will be something like rowscolumnsfeatures the shape you have here would be nonsense in most cases indicating that each input sample is a single number tfkeraslayersinputshape=<number>,r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTOWZWYktjQTJENVBBWjhEY0FZdEN5UC1QX2JuYVYwckk5endiRjc1c3VXbzV0QjA2ZEVZZ09fam9HUkVESUU2YmpTbi1KVWpyVGw4NVZZRV9nYnVEMlE9PQ==
the output of a gnn will naturally be features for all the nodes assuming your edges arent also being learned you just need to write a helper function to recreate the tf graph tensor from the node features presumably you created the graph tensor in the first place so you just make it again except using the gnn output as your node features thats if i understand you right but it sounds like you dont really need it in graph tensor form anyway if you just want the answers use the gnn output directly youll have one feature vector per node shape= nodesfeatures,r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZ2Nsc2ZLcUpoVUZnNmhjUjZINFozbW5MbXcyaDVWVHdyWVNSVTIxb3lwT3l3Z2V3Sk5NOEowNjdnLUZJRVNOSGFtWXQ2WC1sdEVGamNHSzFCV1pmc2c9PQ==

as it is having both image and text as command so its multimodal model for sure and trust me its not a beginners project you can do lots of stuff with lots of library api available there but if you want to stick to this field and know deeper its important to know the basic i would recommend you start by classifying images then localizing and finally segmentation and in parallel you can start text summarization i think one day it may give you the idea why i suggested this approach cheerio,r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQ09PQkFsZDdncldCUmJEdUlUZWFEWE5MSHlPTEhSdGtoalZHeXZoY19LX0s1NUNvSDNyQ3pDbkpZOXR5aGxPUkdjTkk2SlVCTl9CTjNSNmJ1TXRvdXc9PQ==

does your model convert to tflite have you tried running inference and checking the results you will input the series up until a point and it will predict the following values if you want to continually predict the next value the naive solution is to run the entire series as input on each inference the lstm stores memory as it processes through the input series it does not store memory between inferences you as a developer do not need to manage these the page on the tflite docs for rnn <url>,r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTc1dQVzZmNmVldkNQTjhrZTltT2lTVHZ2WlhTWXpmRmVZQ0dlTzJsX3RJWkJZSVcwSENmUGRLLTFnOENHdUozTGEyT2dibFU5R0R6aUh0RVEzV1ExMFRKVTBSZ1pWWXRnaFJpaHBxNjJnMFk9

bigger network lower learning rate or higher learning rate with gradient clipping lower dropout rate also make sure to disable dropout when evaluating use batchnorm play with the regularization rate etc dont expect your model to be as good as a kagglers after a certain point optimization is kind of like cooking and you need to develop an intuition on whats going wrong with it and stare at a lot of plots and baby the model to see whats going on,r/tensorflow,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1OG9hclg4MzB5aGtGNmM1SGhQZzhvM0w4dXI4TGRqclduSE4xekVCQWV6aDc2ZUxCOFJDY3hJc1dXVkFKd3FxTjQyTnhZTVRicXAtdVpyLXpQQjlmSEE9PQ==
