why would you want to use a humanoid android which is btw redundant for manual labor it would be incredibly inefficient these bodies werent designed they evolved and the relatively recent development of features like walking upright means that there are a lot of issues theres literally no reason not to design an artificial construct for the purpose unless theres some reason to use a human form eg if the primary purpose would be to interact with humans not to mention if it were actually agi there would be massive ethical concerns about treatment that amounts to enslavement,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM1pHbGEtRmtobUxFNkVWMDg1SXozNVJDRFhxbDNMcEtYUG15NWxWR04tZzRaZUs0VEQzcHJUQjFwT19zRWlHVmZmR1k5Y0lCekIzeTE4RFBSVkQwTWc9PQ==

well the conversation around emotional intelligence ei in ai development is fascinating and crucial its also about bridging the gap between human emotions and technological advancement which ensures that as we progress we dont lose sight of what makes us inherently human and our ability to empathize connect and also to understand each other on a deeper level integrating ei into ai presents a unique opportunity to enhance our interactions with technology which makes them more intuitive and meaningful imagine ai that not only understands commands but can also sense the emotional context behind them adapting its responses to fit the mood and needs of the user this could revolutionize how we view and interact with technology making it a more supportive and understanding companion in our daily lives for those interested in exploring how ai can be developed with a focus on emotional intelligence i recommend checking out sensay<url>,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMW83NHpNVExIaW5FMjdLazBrS3ZiTUFtdjhXYW03ODNacWkzcGFadHNXdGxGOWJqTXlURzhVRjhVYnVacmJzM19OZVZNbldtNHVibTZnRENuU1EzZ1E9PQ==

indeed a pure capitalist society devolves into slavery of some form or another be it chattel feudal or wagery the result is the same an upper class with received but no incentive to innovate and a lower class with incentive but no resources to innovate only the gentry have both but they occupy a comparatively small portion of the overall population and tend only to innovate in service of the upper class which they are tentatively part of,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3WWFYc2dmcVc3QnhLM21NMUxMS283eklDOHpQWXZGOG4wbjlyekkySDlLRFE5YXFreVpHLUxQOTY1RXJuUUpuY3VhWklWbmp1bDVSSkpxc3JlVGpNdkE9PQ==

you seem to think capitalism is a form of government in a truly capitalist society there is no government to enforce any kind of forced labor let alone property rights one can only ever truly own what they can protect personally and dont forget unions within a single company are not incompatible with capitalism the consumer has every right to either patronize their company or someone elses mutual aid is also not incompatible with capitalism neither are socialist collectives who simply occupy a space in say what is now national forrest land and create their own noncapitalist utopia in fact allowing for a truly free market to exist somewhere without government interference is the only way for socialism to do do the same theres a lot of land out there for people to homestead much of it prime real estate the only people i ever saw attacking a rainbow gathering had taxfunded uniforms badges guns helicopters horses trucks if it wasnt for the government we could have simply lived where we were i suspect most selfprofessed socialists want to enslave people just as most selfprofessed capitalists do to force them to participate in an economic and industrial system of their own choosing,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cmVqNVFoc2JVUFpIR0RTNWtrQW5iSk45a3NsMk10cGtoNExTMENjcV8xZzkyUVJkQTFEU1JXZlBYcGdnc0h3YXVscHhfb2xFRFhDdnhvX0dvUUV0TTNPbl8xRm5jbVNGZmcwdGt0V0pGWUk9

i mean you gotta start somewhere first it was believed that quantum activity cant exist in living organisms even it consciousness isnt quantum in nature i dont really see any theory about consciousness at the moment thats well supported by evidence so even if it turns out wrong what would be learned by testing this theory could lead to what is the true nature of consciousness even if its something else,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDZmVuRDRTMGpaTXhCRGo0TUJHVTdlWHlfTy0zRVJZUmUxOG51dXJhbFhrV0JLLWhrSUI2Z2lVZUtrOXFJSWtleEdFWWNRT1lBOEtobHpfR2tCOExNbWc9PQ==

so are emergent properties of sensory processing not enough to explain consciousness im not saying that this is well understood nor that it cant include any quantum processes im open minded to those and more but sensory processing memory rationalisation future planningmodelling subjectivity etc seem plausible as emergent properties of even synthetic neutral networks are there properties of consciousness that cant be explained do quantum physics change anything fundamental in that approach at best it can introduce more efficient emergent processing of information no basically what i mean is whether its quantum or non quantum it could be either or both but fundamentally that kind of doesnt matter because the functioning of our minds is on a larger scale and patternsbehaviours emerge the more you zoom out still fun to find out so go science i guess i dont know what people mean when they propose that consciousness is quantum or otherwise isnt consciousness just a subjective experience so theres no guarantee that you and i experience it the same thought being biologically human means wed be more alike than not what about my cat my dog the dolphin and his octopus friend where do you draw the line even without quantum our neutral networks process a lot more information than what chatgpt can do neurons can respond to more varietydiversity of stimuly than what current synthetic neutral networks can im not saying ais are conscious just what even qualifies as consciousness where do we draw the line and how do we know were right does quantum physics somehow buy us time to differentiate ourselves quantum computers arent exactly impossible would a quantum intelligence count as conscious i rambled on enough,r/transhuman,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNETk80eml2b29reHdQTUI4aWhJMnZFQzlYX0gyVnVWbmpEVlY5ak5kT3lwNDA3cmtzUUpENmlhcmpWWDRqQXJ4Zm53N2hmblgzcWQ2M1BHXy0teFNRT0E9PQ==
