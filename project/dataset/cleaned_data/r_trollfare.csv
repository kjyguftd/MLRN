so the suggestion should anyone need a tldw is to shamelessly and relentlessly bombard every online space you have access to with simple but effective propaganda every day if you get banned or muted just make a new account and proceed the next day this isnt a new idea for years ive seen leftists claiming that if we just act like the tea partyqanon then well be as successful at capturing the democratic party as the tea partyqanon has been in capturing the republican party thats not going to work there is an asymmetry in the audiences you are trying to attract conservatives tend to focus on the negative they have a stronger physiological response to threats they fear new experiences and are psychologically reactive to fear<url> and it is all too easy to make up a bunch of bullshit that plays on those psychological tendencies and manipulates those base emotions liberals on the other hand are simply not motivated by fear and anxiety in the same way and you cant use to same tactics to rile them so much that have them eating out of the palm of your hand all you have to do is consider the partisan divide on things like critical thinking facts evidence and logic reason i agree completely about the importance of organization and making a concerted effort that amounts to more than yakking about your politics inside your own echo chambers as well as the need for simple easy to digest messages that can be clearly communicated but its going to take more than inventing some compelling propaganda and blasting it all over the internet,r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSUGlxQWp3M0RTS1p5RWdheDJRS2g1R0owaG0yMEQ0eFlud2RDRHF3eE1xcm4yRU0zZkpwUHBlM0kzYm9kc2luSHdKY1FadFhucnJXblBtMFFCV21XUUlTVHY0WlZyWlFIWjNsOVZpaEUtQTg9

one of the worst effects of subtle russianstyle active measures trolling is that it hurts sincere people who have views similar to the views of the active measures people my feeling is that most of the active measures thats inyourface is there just to distract us from the subtle active measures stuff which is usually made up of reasonably polite wellwritten posts about topics other than edit directly about politics then the stuff that is directly political about how the americans have problems too is so wellwritten and so reasonable that its hard to have any serious objection to the posts themselves the problem is with bots pretending to be something that theyre not spamming that stuff all over the place to try to hurt ukraine somehow we need to figure out strategies for controlling insincere mass manipulation without hurting sincere dissenters,r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJScWtXTVRLTmwxVEVYVDBwWnFvVjIwUGxYTVlpQlZ4UkRLTlVOYk9NMG56R211Ykx2YkZrUFJZd1JYU3l0bjBVTGhjX2kxVkdINm9uaG5aZ1NrX190cFE9PQ==

it is all about controlling the narrative populism is about controlling the narrative and telling people what they want to hear rather than the truth of things beware the populist because they are never on the side of the people but they need the people to give them credibility so they tell them any damn thing they think might chime with their personal narrative sadly it works becuase these people are not so bright and feel kind of isolated so when a person with clout says something like guns are good this chimes with their narrative and they embrace that person like they are sent by god,r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQmFBTGNxb0tjUEJBM1dXeDFWZUVQTlVGMFNaZm1MN181MWZYM2dxMjBjamFYcjEzQ3lDZkNiRUluSjI0SE15dU9CbEQ2SjF1NFFLVVJwM0drQk9MQmc9PQ==

i dont know about china but one thing is certain the pro zionist army is all over reddit especially in rworldnews where its pretty clear when they start their day to the point its becoming an inside joke for instance here<url> people are speculating about paid trolls its amazing how quickly fake news are relayed in reddit and the us media without verification when it comes to this conflict and how correctionsretractions are buried or downright shadowbanned two examples of that are <number> the fake story of the beheaded babies<url> that was forcefully propagated on the major social medias and its retraction almost completely silent the fact that the white house admitted not having first hand account of it was silenced too <number> the fake story of the failed palestinian rocket<url> after the gaza hospital was bombed that story was pushed by the idf and relayed by the us and prominently featured in the us media and social medias for days dozens of articles relaying this theory were posted on the subreddit eventually after a week the nyt and several researchers identified that the rocket originated from israel but that story was completely buried in rworldnews intentionally while several of these rebuttals were posted on rworldnews none could see the light of day in a subreddit with <number>m users and tens of thousands online at any time the censorship is strong it is also remarkable how unproven theories are relayed as facts like the convenient theory of the hamas terrorists that hide in the population first off it cannot be an excuse for indiscriminate killings of civilians like it is by the israeli government and drunk wholesale by the white house secondly there is exactly zero proof of this it is most likely that most gaza fighters live among their own families andor simply defend their families these people are indiscriminately labeled hamas terrorists even if they dont belong to the hamas as this gives the idf an excuse to expedite the ethnic cleansing of gaza in any case the israeli government doesnt give any proof of their allegations and thus shouldnt be trusted wholesale but the fine folks in the western medias are very happy to relay the theory of the human shielding without verification,r/trollfare,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSN01HNXUxc0dPQzd6TmpDOVNfX1haR09mNk10OXFURG9FcnB5azR5MDNsakt5bXhEckM4aWZBVWg2b0diaFA4djdlTmlBWTh6dy1IcEdKUjY0dVc5LUE9PQ==
