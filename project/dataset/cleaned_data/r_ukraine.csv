decades of cleanup will be required there will be areas far too dangerous to allow people into and have to be blocked off for example france belgium still have areas saturated with uxo more than a century after wwi ended and people are still killed maimed by the occasional uxo going off plenty of lost gear helmets bits of uniforms and of course human remains lay buried and who knows how many hundreds of tons of unexploded ordnance lay in forests under streets in fields etc alas ukraine will be similar to that and you absolutely do need proper extensive training and equipment to do the cleanup right and with relatively low risk,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV0YzWW9XbkVRekwwYk5GT1JkajNNVS1PSWN5a1VxekZDWUs3QXIxSVFqV3pETGxxTjFOTy1GUGlLaHN3MGNPaVRuTDhHRXdsbDlCX1RXWVVqcWliRXY5RURsM28wMWhKVDFNRG1rN09HLXM9

the last time i was in kyiv i opened conversations in ukrainian and english but mostly spoke in english because the people i met switched to english rather than listening to me struggle and perhaps they wanted to practice their own english they dont speak english as much outside kyiv but i highly recommend you first start with a few words in ukrainian to set the scene as a friendly visitor rather than the invaders language then switch to whatever language works for both of you when i was there all three languages were used once people knew you but it helps to make a positive first impression,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZRElMclVqTjk1eGhmQ1FCWWdLaS1UelRuRTIyc2dKWURWR1JxckJJRDBxV2xjakoyRXlzcEMtV2NRRXUyNDhnSDFkUmgxWjMxcnRadlRSWEtGNnpvdnc9PQ==

> this sgrade copium has been going around since the beginning of the war yes since the start of the war some analysts had predicted in <number><number> years russia will have burned through their reserves of soviet equipment and that their economy eventually overheats meaning they wont be able to sustain the war at anywhere near the current intensity those predictions look to be about right in a couple years the russians are in real trouble to sustain the war effort at anything near the present level the sanctions mean they are burning through their cash reserves as the trading partners they have left bend russia over the barrel from both ends once when they buy their oil and other resources at bargain basement prices and then again when they sell them sanctioned goods those trading partners dont want to paid for those goods in useles rubles they want foreign currency which russia is running out of because they are making very little off what they export that is not sustainable long term and once they cant pay for those dual use goods they wont be able to produce new military equipment at the rate they are now especially higher end stuff like tanks airplanes cruise missiles and so on people complain the sanctions arent working the whole point is that you could never stop it all but you can grind them down over time which they are and multiple analysts looking at satellite imagery have confirmed russia is running out of tanks artillery pieces and armored vehicles in storage within a couple years at most it will be pretty much gone sure russia has a lot of men they could conscript but even though russias best chance to win the war was in the <number> month period when us aid was suspended putin was still reluctant to have an additional wave of mobilization to get more men to the front russia having a bigger population doesnt matter as much when putin is too afraid to draft men and yes ukraines success does depend on its allies continuing to supply it but that has been true since the start of the war if you think the west is suffering from war fatigue what do you think the average russian is feeling right now so in <number> to <number> years russia has a failing economy and no soviet era stocks to fall back on to provide heavy weaponry for their troops even if putin decides to forcibly mobilize more more men at that point if they have little to fight with other than an ak and some body armor the war is not going to go in their favor its not sgrade copium to look at the current situation and see that the long term outlook doesnt seem to favor russia,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX0h4cURPSjU1NGNiZ3Q5QTd5SDQ0cHJrOGtsUlVid2FqSVA5QjhSbFRlZ0dka2FJMC1acDBqTGxENTd3SndOSGFYdUpiOUFZOGMwNGFwMC1UWHFLV2c9PQ==

i think it will ukranians are very motivated to distance themselves from russia and become more european instead they will be looking increasingly at the attitudes and opinons of eu citizens and move towards those the mere fact that putin and official russian policy is very antilgbt could make some ukranians embrace the opposite stance because they dont want to share values with russia seeing lgbt+ persons fighting for the freedom of their shared nation certainly wont hurt either but i think it will be combination of factors that moves the needle here,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdU1Fd25UNXFlc3V6WktmY1NQU201QlJZSEZ6SGgyeTUzaEtBSV9HVmRlYmxSQ3RiY1VQbWtMMHhlWEl5c1RyNHByQWRRN3V0cmxwTlZsdjNlVkhVVkZUQVJVSGFhQVN4Tm1vY2cxbFM4Snc9

> russia of course would never dare to attack defense production in the rest of europe one<url> two<url> three<url> four<url> and im sure im missing a few >and ukrainian cities are nowhere close to becoming unlivable and history has shown random attacks on civilians only tend to strengthen their resolve to resist it worked for nato intervention force in serbia though >as i said ukraine is dependent on foreign aid to win this war but the difference is the west can decide to give that support and give ukraine the equipment and support they need to win the war or it can decide not to because expending ukraine is more politically palatable as is the case now and seems to be going into the future > in a couple years at most russia will be running out of heavy weapons to supply their troops with oh cool more copium thing is the axis of evil doesnt want russia to lose china especially to whom russia needs to set landgrabbing precedent and collect all the pains so they can prepare accordingly to taiwan hell on that ill quote roc directly here you go<url> >joseph wu the foreign minister of taiwan said on thursday that a halt in us arms shipments to ukraine would embolden china in its aggressions against taiwan and fuel propaganda from beijing that the united states is an unreliable partner when people ask us whether it is ok for the united states to abandon ukraine the answer is no because the world is operating not in a blackandwhite way or if you only look at one theater at a time he said the world is interconnected if russia is able to occupy more of ukraine and claim victory he added it would be seen as a victory of authoritarian states because russia china north korea and iran they are now linked together mr wus comments made in a wideranging hourlong interview in taipei come as the biden administration tries to get congress to pass a supplemental funding package that would give <cur><number> billion of aid to ukraine >many house republicans are staunchly opposed to giving more aid to ukraine adopting the america first posture embraced by former president donald j trump a prorussia candidate who has pressed them to reject the package for months they claimed they would be willing to consider providing more assistance for kyiv if the biden administration imposed severe immigration restrictions at the united states border with mexico but at mr trumps urging they balked at a funding package that would have done that calling the border measures too weak >the package also includes <cur><number> billion of aid to counter china in the asiapacific region <cur><number> billion of which would refill stocks of us weapons sent to taiwan and it includes <cur><number> billion of military aid to israel some republican lawmakers contend that china is a bigger threat than russia and that the funding proposed for ukraine should go toward countering china but other republican officials in congress and many democrats make the same argument as mr wu that taiwans security is linked to that of ukraine because china will see weakness on the part of the united states and a greater chance of success in a potential invasion of taiwan if ukraine is defeated chinese leaders have said for decades that taiwan a de facto independent island must be brought under the rule of the communist party by force if necessary xi jinping chinas leader has continued to promote that position >the us and taiwanese governments have been trying to deter china from notions of invading taiwan including through military buildup in the region and bolstering alliances with other democratic nations if the united states abandons ukraine mr wu said china will take it as a hint that if it can keep up sustained action against taiwan the united states is going to back off the united states and its allies are going to back off the thinking among chinese officials would be this he said ok since russia could do that we can do that as well so the us determination in providing support to those countries suffering from authoritarian aggression it is very important mr wu said after us troops withdrew from afghanistan in <number> china pushed propaganda through traditional staterun media and social media that the us commitment to anything is not firm mr wu said we suffered from a huge wave of cognitive warfare >china has also spread disinformation stressing russian narratives of the war mr wu said including the idea that the expansion of nato forced president vladimir v putin to attack ukraine and that the united states is ultimately not committed to supporting ukraine >on the eve of russias invasion in february <number> mr putin visited mr xi in beijing and their two governments announced a no limits partnership mr wu said some central and eastern european nations seeking to forge antiauthoritarian partnerships had strengthened their relations with taiwan during the war his comments on the need for the united states to keep supporting taiwan echo those of other senior taiwanese officials in may <number> bikhim hsiao then taiwans de facto ambassador to the united states and now the incoming vice president made similar arguments to reporters in washington and in february representative raja krishnamoorthi democrat of illinois said during a visit of american lawmakers to taiwan that the current president tsai ingwen and the presidentelect lai chingte made clear to the lawmakers that if for some reason the ukrainians do not prevail that will only encourage hostilities against taiwan as well as >ukraines survival is taiwans survival ukraines success is taiwans success taiwans representative in washington bikhim hsiao told the mccain institutes sedona forum last weekend our futures are closely linked<url> so yeah >and air defences in ukraine are being dramatically increased this year with more of new patriot interceptor production being allocated to ukraine an example of the west choosing to increase support and being able to do so dramatically i guess you forget to factor in that ukraines sam grid is weakening overtime in general those s<number> batteries that kept russian fighters and bombers at bay the will fall silent once reloads for launchers run out and pledged patriots cant protect shit only provided ones do but there can easily be gap measured in years between those >meanwhile russia is trying to evade sanctions and paying sky high prices with their ever dwindling foreign currency supply all while getting sanction waivers to keep trading hydrocarbons because god forbid sanctions actually biting them<url> they still have huge incomes ukrainian economy meanwhile is dead >russia isnt just fighting ukraines economy they are fighting most of the industrialized worlds economies which are completely fine with slowly feeding ukraine to russia long as it doesnt require much payments theres nothing like lendlease ongoing its basically scraps to barely hold the line maybe even getting pushed back a bit but nowhere close to being able to push russians out >if those countries decide to continue support that fight can never favor russia their economy is in freefall and their war effort relies on soviet era equipment thats such a tremendous if i dont think you even grasp the enormity of it >meanwhile ukraines allies economies are doing fine

the ussr was absolutely a military superpower but only because it represents the zenith of the russian empire i use quotes because i consider the ussr to be a brief period in an unbroken history of an aggressively expansionist authoritarian land empire centered on moscow so here it is at the high water mark of its territorial control and its extracting enormous wealth and labor from conquered nations a lot of it got channeled into the military but i dont think the collapse of the ussr was inevitable at least not for that reason the ussr was scary because it put the combined power of a huge number of nations in the hands of moscow when those nations gained independence it left the russian federation with an inheritance of materiel but not the industrial base to continue being the superpower the ussr was theres a reason why the russian navy doesnt build large surface ships anymore and why it cant maintain the gas turbines in some of its fleet all that stuff was built in the ukrainian ssr before the collapse this war is a very obvious attempt by russia to rebuild what it sees as its lost emipre,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnLS1QN0dJaGVvS0NaRmhkQW9HM2pqWU1tMm1XYXN0WnZfQjRYZG00OVBUNnUyQnNuMXN0RGQ1TktEeUVhNnlXTTQ5THdJaVR3cW1YcFRtZ19KWWhzMlZtRTFVTjM0OGhpTWp6YWVDY19uZVU9

on the front lines the number of russian army attacks decreased yesterday likely due to the rotation of units that had suffered losses on the kharkiv front the intensity of the offensive has sharply decreased compared to the previous two days and isolated attacks were unsuccessful in the svatove and severodonetsk areas attacks on the town of kupiansk decreased the activity on the luhansk front was higher but there was no success comparatively active attacks continued on the siversk front but the situation remains unchanged in the area around bakhmut regular attempts to advance on the town of chasiv yar and south of bakhmut continue the front line has not moved an active offensive continues towards toretsk where ukrainian units are struggling to maintain their positions around the settlement of new york on the pokrovsk front the most intense offensive continues with attacks occurring around the clock the russian army did not manage to make progress yesterday main battles are ongoing inside and around the settlement of krasnohorivka the intensity of the battles here fluctuates and the situation remains the same on the southern front the tempo of the russian units offensive has slowed the reported retreat of ukrainian forces from the village of urozhaine has not been officially confirmed but it seems plausible on the east bank of the dnipro russian units are minimally active and routine attacks on ukrainian positions have not been successful,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR2kyUm9IeVp2RkdsZlVNSm9vY3dQdzFnUFFuQVdocklzd044aTJteFN1RFB4bzVqczZab29rVjhUaHVGWW1kODJnRkRBcnVvTUZLTDZOc1NnUGwtSlE9PQ==

my suspicion is that pilots are being trained on a per role basis mirage <number>s role is very likely to be to lob storm shadows since its enabled for those missiles it doesnt carry as many as su<number> would but it exists and the s are likely running down their airworthiness by now not gone at least less so a mirage pilot in theory to be an effective addition only needs to know how to takeoff land move to position and loose a cruise missile from well out of engagement range with some knowledge to crank and dive from a long range shot at them if your pressing need to maintain cruise missile throwing is that high you could cut a lot of roles out of their knowledge if youre never going to be using them for that obviously its better to be more rounded but in emergency situations sometimes you can make that judgement call for a role that is by and large relatively divorced from more intertwined needs,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRnU2aEo2S1dWRllRSUZuQ3c1TlF3c2NEYjdRTVhaYnlWU0xlbnRYQk5ET3dwbG9VR21IR0EyamQya2RpMUlzQkFmNk1uWUJIcDhvX3BMYjkxMGgyZFE9PQ==

this its not that you lose <number> attackers per defender but you need <number> attackers per defender in rough terms specifically you need to take into account weapons armour artillery morale readiness and all sorts of numbers to get a calculable score that you then measure against your opponents score if you have a higher multiple than <number> then you can attack as for how this came about its from soviet studies post ww that then went on to influence all of their military training and studies seriously if you check out their operational manuals they have down to the individual shell how many you need from mortars to mm rockets to kill <number> of a foe from entrenched infantry to tanks in column to fortified defences they tried to turn war into a science and that <number><number> score comes from that but in general terms because its not as catchy to say you need to compute your pros and cons against the defenders to identify a <number><number> advantage compared to you need <number><number> odds to win its what everyone thinks the <number><number> number is about,r/ukraine,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOThUZXBfV1hTQUc0X1pFQ0VSTTQxVFdlWXMydk9xLUV5SER2bkJaM3Y0TWdJWVBtSFNTN0QyU0pCUG1TNjZmWGt3Vi1KVXlxX2tCZ180NV9oZVM4Z2c9PQ==
