while osint is used to corroborate claimsa lot of these estimates are statistical in mature based on intelligence troop movements observation of troops committed etc this is intelligence agencies bread and butter the russian army was probably one of the most monitored forces in the world and troop strength and structure would have been very well known the discrepancies cam probably be put down to the quality of intelligence and perhaps a difference im methodology it also matters how these casualties are spread out for example if <number> formations lose <number>rd of their troops thats <number> formations that are combat ineffective if <number> unit is completely destroyed thats only <number> unit its more complicated to refresh a semi destroyed unit than to just replace it with a different one the k headline number is a good indication of how badly things are going for russia but it needs to be synthesized with other information to get a good picture of the effect of these casualties for example seeing more ts in action shows a depletion of tank stocks seeing the new forces in kharkiv equipped with motorbikes and quads shows a depletion of infantry vehicles observing this on smaller scales allows intelligence agencies to pinpoint the deficiencies of individual units for russia k is basically nothing they will just force more and more people into service and not really care because anyone who complains is jailed so it more shows the determination of putin to see this out whatever the cost may be,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYnFoVXM4ejdiMzdmbWp1WkhfdUEzTnZVNTZ2MlpaMmpKOXJxWklLSjlseW5XWEZXOWMxZlp0OV9XRlRISTBsMGQteTdyQklJVlYxcEphMDcxUEUyUXc9PQ==

at best that sounds like ignorance or more like obfuscation if were being less charitable the terms still have meanings and torturing them until those meanings are obscured to the average person only helps extremists liberalism generally concerns itself with equality under the law personal property rights and political liberty downstream from concepts like the free marketplace of ideas and the social contract leftism generally concerns itself with curtailing or discarding these things to even out societal heirarchy securing power and better material conditions for groups perceived as historically disadvantaged it doesnt take much political education to realize that aside from some rare leftists who genuinely like the flavor of gradual reform more than that of subversive counterculture and revolutionary movements these are largely exclusive viewpoints and you wouldnt really call those democratic socialists far left anyways just left,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQ3R6YjN1YXpJOThOZVNIWXprRFdoYk1MM053ckZJcEVicG50elFoUmEwZmdNMllabHRlV0h0NUNfMEo3Ul9HbU8yN3BWMllpc1ZBS1VJazJWZjFfZnhzUnpGdjI1aTdsd3dRNFh5VHMwMnM9

i dont think this is necessarily true sure if you have no other choice for artillery youll use it but these are old any shells russia still has from when they produced these are going to be well past their use by date anything they get from nk to fire out of these is going to be old andor of dubious quality it causes the same problems ukraine has been suffering logistical bottlenecks now you need to find the parts and shells for an entirely different system and get it to where it needs to be if you have one truck supplying both mm and mm systems each system only gets so much ammo and because of their age the ms are probably going to need more ammunition to have the same effect on a target as a more modern and accurate system dont get me wrong im happy to see russia being forced to use older and older systems but from an overall perspective its not something a military wants to deal with,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNnE5RmJWVGlzQU8zNW1WcTBWcUlhcFJFMXJwcG4tMk01NUxNSDBDcUFKUTVoR2prbzI1anhQNkZwMmZZX0ZlQzFwSmZSbldNVTlvY3o3QUxNa1dvLXc9PQ==

well its true war economies are great for nationsin the short term lots of jobs lots of money in industries lots of investment the problem is that war economies focus on producing military goods not civilian ones you cant pay teachers with tanks and you cant feed your civilians with artillery shells so shifting to a war economy gives a vital boost to an economy but it only lasts so long wars dont really end because one side killed all the enemy soldiers wars end because its too expensive for one party to keep going,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZzVMQVI1Nld1dEdjOHhoNlFvd3JHU3VpajJpUmNyU09tUkZIMlc0OV83UmNEVWlFLTc3R3JhcVVTUl84X3QyWTlyUVBTakJGMTJrQXJhQWN2cDBWMnc9PQ==

im sure that ukrainians are taking casualties and every one is a tragic loss but im also sure that there are many many soldiers who through experience have ramped up their level of expertise and are in a position to pass it on to newer soldiers and help them stay alive and be effective i think the situation may me not equal on the russian side fewer front line soldiers stay alive long enough to learn anything and the massive losses they have suffered means a loss of experience and institutional knowledge that cascades through the system on top of various corruption related factors im hoping that the whole rotten system is just degrading over time and it will be higher and higher losses for fewer and fewer gains two and a half years in and the invaders are taking months to advance a few kilometers in narrow zones of intense effort and not moving at all in most of the thousand mile front,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZR1RfaElOd2lpeldLckZsNkVYbUFWTTJBQ0VWdEhGRmV6eFNnSGhKZmwxWEZHYkF3S0s2OFRrdFhUeHRMMWJsaFlhczBRYjVTdU5UUVNURXdLR0hScmk4M0lzZEd3Q0hWT2J0QlY5SFRZWWM9

barrel life is the number of full loads a barrel can endure before barrel wear reduces precision too much and more importantly poses a risk due to premature detonation of the shell in the barrel if you only use eg half the amount of propellant charge the effective barrel life will be more than <number> shots because barrel wear isnt linear to the size of the charge however every shell fired causes wear and sooner or later the barrel will not provide a tight seal anymore it will leak gas leading to inconsistent firing patterns some shells may have a better seal than others especially with shells manufactured to questionable tolerances such as those from north korea rebarreling a wornout gun isnt a big deal if you have good quality steel and the tools to do so since russia doesnt produce the shells for that system anymore they also dont produce the system itself chances are that the tooling and machinery has long been soldscrappedturned into a yacht so either theyll have workable guns for a few weeks or they will have to set up an entire production line for mm barrels my guess is that theyll just burn through the guns and then move on to the next legacy system,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSTVFSmxiSzlXSHdRTkFDeDBwNkhiaHd4MVAycVR2eS1LV0RTWTV6dF9EeTJ2N2tpTzJxMGpPcm52amNPSFZoS05Vckl2blZFVHc4NUpOOUxGNE56MV92Xy02d0huTTFLbDBuR2dDdmxsdlk9

ok so fair enough for those who are pointing out that this may indicate that russia is running out of more recent weapons systems but what i dont get or necessarily agree with is that just because these systems are older that this somehow implies they are also somehow useless these weapons and many other older systems were capable of inflicting mass death and injury when they were made and as far as i can see thats unlikely to have changed despite their age nato and other western alies often have some very old weapons systems in their inventory but we kept them because in many cases they have proven their usefulness many times over and in some cases in actual combat position sure a lot of these guns would probably need extensive servicing but i dont think its beyond russias capacity to undertake this work anyway no doubt some numbnuts will downvote this statement theres a segment of the reddit population who just dont like reality it seems even though im an ardent supporter of the ukrainian cause and i would like all of these things destroyed as quickly as possible but weve been hearing almost since the start of this war that russia is running out of weapons and every week or two we hear this statement repeated once again what i dont like about it is that making this assumption might lead to complacency a complacency that might ultimately be reflected in the press and the public at large if that happens the danger is that we will continue to underestimate the resources that ukraine undoubtedly needs to put an end to this thing for once and for all,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY180UE9yQkxaTmx5TGZuUHllanNJYWllRF9YVXZDaVZCWXNxZnNPSEk5dGZUazRnRVNuU3N5cm95TXo3aDBvaUVSdjJqdWZjTVVKdFVGaHQ5cHdkN2c9PQ==

>epileptic seizure in man known as a grand mal epileptic fit during which the brain is severely stimulated the body exhibits tonicclonic activity and there is complete loss of consciousness during the first tonic phase when current flows through the brain the animal collapses and stops breathing with the front legs extended rigidly and the hind legs flexed into the body the second clonic phase sees the animal relax and start involuntary kicking of both the fore and hind legs as the clonic activity subsides the animal moves into the third recovery or exhaustion phase it is recognised that while an animal is in the first two phases it is unconscious and therefore insensible to pain however the onset of the third phase is an indication that the animal is beginning to recover and may be able to experience pain the first sign that an animal is recovering from the effect of the stun is a return to normal rhythmic breathing rhythmic breathing can be determined by watching for the rise and fall of the chest with evenly spaced breaths this should not be confused with random gasping agonal breathing a result of spasmodic muscle contractions which can occur when the brain is dying during these random contractions air can also be forced from the lungs causing the animal to make involuntary noises,r/ukrainewarvideoreport,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhd3MwRDY5bWdySXVETVdtYVZyWkFoM0ZqTkdjY3hGRGhlc01WZ0d3VjZyUm5QMDdDVVBTNzhYV1IwR2w4SW42dTY3RllYbUhHNDF3YWZFVkVHMkZzemc9PQ==
