let us not forget that in ww churchilll once said stalin complained to him about opening a second front he said that the british empire and the americans planned to bleed russia dry to the last drop of russian blood the russians have the same talking point today because they are uncreative and i do not think the plan is to bleed ukraine dry but our strategy is in my opinion wrong unethical and dangerous due to chaos theory the only ethical war if there is one is fast and overwhelming like an operation desert storm our approach is clearly a way to play this game of chess but it is also a gamble time will tell whether this turns out the way we want it to turn out we dont have just idiots in our ranks though people in this line of work deal in probabilities and mountains of data and they always have the short medium and longterm strategic objectives in mind in the short term this is bad for ukraine and its kind of bad for russia in the long term we will help ukraine to rebuild and transform their economy while russia will wither away or so at least seems to be the line of thinking one thing that disturbs me is entropy the trend of the universe towards chaos and disorder for example the nuclear power plant in enerhordar is a ticking time bomb i do understand the approach i do not approve of it from a moral point of view but morals have no place in the world of geopolitics in this world resources power geography and long term advantages matter it is called the us led alliance therefore it profits the us in some way to do it like that and it surely also profits close allies it surely doesnt profit ukraine it seems the goals are <number> bleed russia dry and prevent the war from spreading beyond ukraine <number> slowly but systemically destroy the russian economy and cause massive attrition but make sure that their oil and natural gas is being pumped and distributed as long as possible <number> restore ukraines sovereignty and eventually let them join nato and the eu in this exact order,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdTd0OUl3eHFIZERTYXB4Z19zSVlJQ2VsaTlfX0M4YVh1NEpfQ2FDclljdGJNLWZZbjk3X1lOX2JHT201dVRKV1RKdlNWQ09ldnQ2SXlRX01ualVrOGc9PQ==

its really just this the global south reflexively hates the west and the us in particular some of it is justifiable some of it is not some of it is about avoiding becoming de facto client states of the us so if the draw towards complete economic and cultural sublimation is so powerful you desperately latch on to whatever is perceived as opposing the west and its culture values and economic might that leaves really only russia and china as adequate substitutions to the west im not entirely unsympathetic to this impulse if you are global south you want exotic power cultural identity and real self determination thats hard to do when youre so underpowered compared to the west in all those things you see the power of western culture and its influence on your society good and bad and you want to ensure your own national identity regardless of if the positives outweigh the negative so the impulse to side with aggressors and tyrants like russia and china is as much about playing the west vs russiachina as it is genuine support or appreciation i get it its self destructive and shortsighted but i get it,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQXJGcGR6OGwwNnBqbFQyR0RQUkdLcEhYSzNGZ1N5bElFcUpoZ0E4cVBHOUxreVBUQXJYUEwzc0VpT2NXcVY0aUEweGxqdmdQLVYtZVNrNkhpTzNfNkE9PQ==

absolute nonsense the west has worked less with russia than the global south and done more to help its victims and has opposed russia in syria and while the war in iraq was mishandled and has a false cb it fundamentally removed a brutal dictator frankly youre just an oikophobic racist it doesnt matter to you if the west did its best for syria and literally ended slavery via the british navy unlike any other civilization and invented all these rights during its zenith while it was in charge unlike any other civilization before it dismantling itself partly for political reasons despitw a thousand to thousands of years of demograpgic gains gained in as little as one century ending internecine warfare and economy population life expectancy and eventually political and human rights before any of these new values took over and flagellating themselves like idiot oikophobes fact of the matter is before modern humanism took charge in the west the west was a fairly benign empire with massive even insane demographic gains and occasional evil which was considered honorable by tbe standards of the time oikophobes since then couldnt find any enemy to identify themselves against and decided on other factions and even their own civilization sounds like you if youre western people who flagellate themselves like idiots even as they support the rest of the world constantly with foreign aid debt forgiveness and help in both syria and ukraine will naturally be accused by war profiteering racists who help russians massacre ukrainian of being racists with whatever idiotic arguments available whether the person arguing for it is an oikophobic westerner or a southerner doesnt really matter they are racist either way and dont care about ukraine or syria or the uighurs or whats happening in ethioia or sudan its just a chance for them to gain socially to be popular by deriding the ones helping and supporting the ones raping and killing thats what youre doing youre shielding war profiteers while criticizing those aiding ukriane,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY2FBVWJlcHJOUC1tR04xVjdNS2gtNWVvUjRiOFIyVTJoeWhoc1BUa29yVDNKTUhvcnFOVmtjZXRQVU5iT09SWWlhd25lY3ZPV3cxWF96ZFJoSUdhWVE9PQ==

well thank you for a thoughtful response you say that although the war in iraq was mishandled it fundamentally removed a brutal dictator well i would question your characterization of <number><number> dead civilians as mishandled the number of dead civilians is x<number> higher than in ukraine today yet no one in the west is prosecuted in court for committing war crimes which attacking another nation without a un security council resolution is an aggressive war and a war crime so if your evaluation is at best mishandling i would question your ability to evaluate events especially in their legal context i would vehemently disagree that i am an oikophobic racist but if thats your opinion thats fine but an unsupportable assertion your diatribe about the british slavery and syria yeah its beyond me i dont get the point or connection you are trying to make i think the remainder of your history lesson is not at all tangent to the discussion at hand of why the global south has realized a lack of legitimacy of western leadership especially when it comes to a rules based system and the rule of international law and thus in a strategic paradigm that of selfdefence they might be siding with putin as putin in its illegal invasion of ukraine is copying the bush doctrine ie preemptive attack a doctrine set by the americans and president george bush something you conveniently ignore i absolutely celebrate the superior western enlightened democracies as the only beacon for the rest of the authoritarian world to follow that however does not mean we turn a blind eye to fundamental strategic mistakes of stark hypocrisy by the west when it consistently violates the rules based system but then selectively asks the world to follow them sounds like your bias is an inability for objective selfassessment in terms of your throwing around the word racists as if to step onto your highhorse pedestal be more humble please the ukraine is rife with neonazis and a substantial farright movement and has been for the last two decades in fact most of the national guard brigades fighting in eastern ukraine are clearly neonazi units displaying unmistakable nazi iconography and well known farrights commanders all that does not excuse putin for illegally invading ukraine but its better to have some balance in your use of racists as you make a cheap attempt to win an argument by playing the identity card wont work shielding war profiteers hah huh yeah try reexplaining that one hardly the case i am for sure criticizing nations who turned a blind eye to putins thuggery of two decades yet continued a normal relationship and as i already mentioned handing him trillions of euros for cheap energy yup the chickens have come home to roost and putin wouldnt have rebuilt his army without the europeans having such robust trade with an authoritarian bully like putin ill criticize that all day long as it should be,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZEhsa2h3WTgwZmhuZHFSTnVNRjZBRk82TmJFU3U4V2ZIQm1EZFZMYUJYTUh5WUV4TjdMR1ZpeUgxVEJGV09paFRqanNkS1ZEZ09iUDI3U19SN1BtUVE9PQ==

the strategist in me wonders how good of an idea this is dont get me wrong putin deserves his comeuppance for his multitude of crimes against humanity in ukraine but him meeting his end from an assassins bullet risks turning him into a martyr if there was a reasonable chance that putin dying would end this war it would be worth it one million percent but from what ive seen i dont think thats the case quite to the contrary the ukrainians killing the russian leader would likely enrage the russians and get them to commit to the war even more than they already are by all accounts the ones most likely to take power in the event of putins death are if anything more bloodthristy than he is i cant see them willingly pulling back and surrendering given the circumstances personally im hoping that putin dies to russian insurrectionists that would stand a good chance of collapsing the russian state and give ukraine its best opportunity to reclaim its stolen land,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZX3ViOUtwekt5Uklld3VOY1lRdmFwU2RjMXRiQVpfRVhLTjdRaGUwbERRbnFLNzUyNGpKQXFpVkowMU9ZdE80NzJkamtkUGd6Yld2eGUwM0dDbjBfalE9PQ==

i am literally so thankful is white versus white because has it been different and russia be non white they literally would not be allowed the proper criticism that is owed they would absolutely get treated as the good guys and or ctictism be equating to racism and be even more resistant ant than pro russians already are to taking accountability and ability to hear criticism or anger for russians and what they are doing but these people still managed to worm racism in anyway and are like caring at all shows rascist bc muh whatabout and acting like why when we didnt have this level of social media or maybe were just kids or maybe an infant werent caring about muh whatabouts acting like the fact that they didnt see this reaction is something other than a difference in the timed and technology and what is capable happens to be so unique here that its new for all of us meaning this is the level going forward that will be possible if a conflict has the same capacity it involved starlink security cams go pros cell cameras drone footage satellite footage and the ability to upload it and have the platforms we do now that are also interconnected like we werent years ago what it also means is that now war crimes have actual proof for that didnt in the past how easy it is to see lies fall apart that got people to invade and hear the world shooting at them and its while to now be able to see what your own do and watch them be absolute barbarians systematically and be ok with that and not angered and disgusted but instead completely unbothered like this in normal for them all of this stuff and more are factors and all of it gets ignored and people have the nerve to be like i dont get it why this is happening its not like if we in the west backed off that they would take our place they dont want to support and come for the ones who do so in the end theyd like a victim to get no support and have no one in their court nice that all said its not just the global south but the west that do this also aa a greek american wirh familfy in greece i am so disappointed finding out they are heavily under pro russian mindset my own family didnt understand why i cared and my aunt was like oh sweetie youve lost your way  and to see the un meetings and never see a greek be one of the representatives albania thought they are a solid one i didnt expect no particular reason other than i dont know much about them and to hear them be vocal and a solid consistent voice at the ungood on them  and im glad to know they arent victim to russian propaganda as a small country and all the places russia got its pawns on they did something right too bad greece cant get some of that my dad also doesnt care hes greek who moved to the us at <number> anyway so far no luck on my family and see literally a massive absence online from greeks i know they know english and i am really disappointed to see only a handful of times a greek defended ukraine and i was also disgusted to see them then do the exact thing youd expect be the kind that now support the thing thst aligns with the anti west narritive also really upset my dad even reacted this way and found out he hates the jews and blamed them for shit they apparently did in his work years ago i had zero idea he hated jews we literally lived amonst many jews when i grew up and one was my best friend very brown by the way so gotta love all this racism talk lol around i really wish people stopped thinking people use skin color to decicde shit and maybe lisiten to what people say and there be loads infirmation theyd get to understand someone its almost like they project and now that thats what they do we are ware after seeing who does and doesnt support ukraine and his support for white people the one and only time they needed to and it was just to difficult to do we understand the world much better know seeing their views have to be challenged the one time here and it was their choice to show how their credibility would be harmed or helped and want with not caring or actively have been intentionally harmful towards ukraine or pro russia great job showing all the stuff we heard peoole say and about literally not matter years of defending stuff long over and have all the energy in the world for centuries old shit but current victims naawww we dont have time for that now we are busy or dont need to care about wild how if you claim to be suffering from of colonialism or rape of resources or a coup etc and have made it clear this all is why you hate the west and supposedly blame it for all your grief you should be the first ones to sympathize when you see it happen to someone else and understand what they are going through understand why russia is wrong and not want the lasting impacts to happen to them either i just all around find this all just crap its not hard here to either say the right thing and if they cant they had the option of silence at least i can say this is what i noticed for greeks thry got that part right and are just silent thats what the other peoole elsewhere shoukd be capable of and its that seems incredibly difficult and most snd up being pro russian blatantly and zero shame nor fucks that thats the worst thing to do for your reputation and then see <number> years in those same people whip out halos like lol the extreme virture signaling was so cringe since we knew now they dont use morals right versus wrong and dont realize what they look like and even call shit hypocrisy  zero self awareness and thinking shit hasnt changed and they cant do their good old usual moral outdate thats dominated the main narrtive they used to get to say that word and and we gave them the bandit of the doubt and just let them go off <number> and since changed things cant take back your stances and comments but they can take accountability and change and no longer be pro russian anti ukraine but

perhaps now is the time to decide were learning that scale and subsidization benefits nato countries and those that nato supports its the reason the partnership exists and on a macroeconomic scale the benefits are hard to deny also when given the option many nations would choose not to exceed their own domestic defense needs it is short sighted unfortunately but we see evidence in the us that some politicians have an uphill battle funding foreign wars that dont immediately threaten the safety of the citizenry in the end it took six months and cost the us house leader his position to pass the latest round of funding countries are generally resistant to give too much away as you suggest and many countries would prefer to give nothing away that would tradeoff from their own national defense resources the contributions of the nato group flatly outperform scenarios where every country develops their own equipment theres simply more to go around and nonmember states are benefiting moreover there have been zero instances where any member nation or nonmember beneficiary nation is rejecting military support based solely on the country of manufacture and there are zero instances where individual nations are seeing greater returns on a hypothetical <number> gdp investment by bootstrapping it on their own with the use of partially mothballed factories is there any evidence you have to the contrary simply put without nato theres less to go around efficiencies abound standardization and centralization increase the value of each dollar spent by every member country its worth a watch of peruns videos on youtube for more background and he explains why baltic nato nations are incentivzed to contribute disproportionately incidentally you may have noticed nonmember nations have been beneficiaries of the partnership,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSHZGYjZQZlBvNWtldUNuWUJWNXRXeUlvel92cE1QaHJhb0VyTzdYdWZtdGg1QnJoc1hVUk1hd2dmd1NaNmNVNXY3MGl2bG04UHdyT1Mtc21Dc1BzYmc9PQ==

states in global south by and large does sympathize with ukraine it is not that hard to figure in each un vote only very few sided with russia most voted against russian agression and some have abstained the author of the article talking about a particular group of people within global south and their perception and portraying them as representative of whole i am from bangladesh while i cant talk for other countries in global south however i certainly know mine any loss of innocent life a tragedy and everyone should sympathize with the vicitm russia is the clear agressior here and i do sympathize with the innocent people in ukraine but that does not change geopolitical and economic realities on the international stage like it or not russia has the world largest land mass and most natural resources it is not realistic for developing world to cut ties with russia over this war i mean what israel is doing is equally horrible war crimes and injustice are being exposed by wests own institutions and entities europe and us couldve said yes hamas is bad but we wouldnt let you indiscriminately bomb gaza just to kill hamas either or if this is too complicated for some then i can point to the illegal land grabs that israel has been doing that is active colonization by any definition just as horrible as what russia is trying to do in ukraine and guess what everytime such land grab happens west and europe condemns it because they know its wrong but do they cut ties with israel over this no for them it is not a realistic option the same is true wrt russia over its agression in ukriane we can express our disagreement over its deeds but cant realistically cut our ties with the russian federation,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNUFKMVNFYm02anRMQ09oLU1nWThiZE1SWVFNUGlCSGx2ejd2MXFQVE5sWDIxRnVOTjNUNElReXVQNGRFdGIzdFVocUd0RlVtWExQWDhBQjZyR0tFT0kwdXJ2ZWdVZFdZNzlDU2dOVXBTS289

cheap trick from our politicians in the eu to blame the lack of investment in the defense on the population and it wont work to have combat ready forces in case of need what about paying decently to army volunteers and investing in their careers and formation making sure that we have a well trained force ready to react to any threat never thought of that or are we learning from russia that throwing untrained meat to the grinder is the way the same sort of politicians who were rubbing shoulders with putin a few years ago now want to put <number> year olds cleaning barrack toilets and call that investment on defense thanks but no thanks,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQUNNbGVBMXlPRjljSmNwY1NCWFhKZXd4eWRQV2VWczRrWkFuTVF6RXpIWkpxME0wUHgzaHo4bzY3QWNIRU5PV0stR0tXR2FHZXhFQkF1SVl3djBVdHc9PQ==
i believe this statement has many generalizations which is typical of a short sighted view of the world we tend to try to put large chunks of people in boxes an labels them theres no global south as an entity that can be described each country or region had its own dynamics and reasons to take or not a side in the case of brazil my home country its largely a stake at being neutral economic interests and political view of the current party in power china is the <number> trade partner russia is still an important source of fertilizers for agriculture btw agriculture that feeds a good part of the world we are sympathetic with ukraine and hope that the ginny will be put back into the bottle and russia will fall back however that does not mean automatic alignment to us policies its not pretty but its pragmatic btw not more pragmatic than when the us deals with autocratic governments like saudi arabia ignoring a lot for the sake of oil finally if the us really wants ukraine to succeed why withhold weapons they need to do it the answer is theres always an agenda remember iraq,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaczQtZXo0bmtwM0Z1T3JIUmEtMUdESVg3WDc1V1dTdDdkdFAycEwtQ2MyWm9fWV83cGJxSUdlNm8tYTcwcVNGTXZyRmtpazZpM29PVWdoM2VrUlJoRFE9PQ==

i dont think this has to be revoked seeking asylum is human right but it does not make them above the law countries have their procedures for processing asylum seekers they are often required to enter through designated points formally seek asylum and follow instructions during their review if denied which it is likely to be under these circumstances they will be deported if they travelled safely through russia and belarus then it may be considered a safe path back and will be asked or forced to leave the country back over the border otherwise it would be necessary to arrange safe passage asylum seekers who are legitimately fleeing war persecution or famine should be admitted accordingly under certain conditions and with appropriate preparation more will likely need to be done to manage incoming asylum seekers humanely manpower will be needed to process them quickly and in the worst case work will need to be done to arrange passage back but i think there would be a case for sending them back to belarus with transit documents to present to belarusian officials we will of course attempt to cooperate with belarusian authorities on this if they are willing this would be costly but with cooperation a pretty small expense for humanity also consider how utterly wasteful and inhuman these actions are from russia and belarus countries that are already facing a massive demographic crisis that makes the western demographic crisis look like nothing in the medium and long term and done with care and cooperation being able to admit asylum seekers and some migrants at scale would be a boon to western economies and an incredible waste by russia who doesnt even care about its own young men let alone anyone outside moscow if migrants do not follow the instructions of border guards either initially during the review process or after denial of entry then they should be treated with the same amount of force anybody attempting to storm a border should i think we need to spend some money on dealing with this humanely initial investment but we can afford it though may be politically unpopular but then we blunt the effectiveness of these tactics while potentially befitting longterm this is a simplistic and somewhat optimistic view but i dont think we need to compromise our principles to manage and defend our borders,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSUx1djhvSFAxcUxqNUE1Vi1SVFE1VnltNG9OWlVmbDU0N043U0V6bTZYeGo1Tnp4UkNxRUlvWHNRNXJZc3hXQWVkd29xdGgtZVBad3gxc081REhGS1E9PQ==

the german government at the time suspended the dublin agreement it was part of their open border policy and clearly a political decision at the time for refugees you know you can just ask them and they will tell you it was a safe choice to somehow get to germany because they knew they werent going to be sent back and could get asylum relatively easily i am not judging this decision in any way but it is a fact that the government was cduled and these decisions were personally made by angela merkel there is no discussion about it in germany because its just a fact ps in my opinion merkel did a very humane thing i am also proud that germany took in so many ukrainian refugees,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabnVtaWNCY1hFTFZDVzNOVTBaWVdDcnJiQW1ZSEZNN0RvcWRJbDgyUHV2VnVsbTBYRVFTRmswMHlfMVhIWXZFbUMyamNyVnpvSWdxbVE4QjluNklPY0dxTmh1eHBTT05qZC1lcmRKSVBTWlE9

> its pretty shitty to condemn biden for his as long as it takes comment as no one could have foreseen how successful trump would be in turning republicans in congress against ukraine but at the same time restrictions started even before republicans came to power theyre not a only if we could do it but we cant thing they are part of policy since the very beginning hell >biden thought the secretaries had gone too far according to multiple administration officials familiar with the call on the previously unreported conference call as austin flew to germany and blinken to washington the president expressed concern that the comments could set unrealistic expectations and increase the risk of the us getting into a direct conflict with russia he told them to tone it down said the officials biden was not happy when blinken and austin talked about winning in ukraine one of them said he was not happy with the rhetoric<url> assault breacher vehicles were supplied only after official end of counteroffensive >a senior ukrainian official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters said kyiv received less than <number> percent of the quantity of demining and engineering materiel including miclics that it asked for from western partners ahead of the counteroffensive<url> and from about the same time around<url> >brusselswhen ukraine launched its big counteroffensive this spring western military officials knew kyiv didnt have all the training or weaponsfrom shells to warplanesthat it needed to dislodge russian forces but they hoped ukrainian courage and resourcefulness would carry the day and about atacms<url> >previously biden rejected the idea of such supplies fearing that the introduction of american missiles into the ukrainian army which could destroy targets not only in all the occupied territories of ukraine but also in russia and belarus could lead to the outbreak of world war iii bidens fears and the decisions he made to overcome them are described in an article by the new yorker >the publication notes that throughout the year biden categorically refused to make a decision on the transfer of longrange atacms missiles to ukraine because he was afraid of the kremlins reaction according to the american president such a step by the united states would mean an unacceptable escalation for putin as these missiles are capable of reaching not only all the territories of ukraine occupied by russia but also targets in russia or belarus so as you could see whenever there was a window of opportunity it got ignored for nonescalation not to mention considering ukraine being able to win as unrealistic expectations and also as outright dangerous to us foreign policy oh and the lendlease <number> thing not a single bolt supplied through it before it was allowed to expire despite each and every opportunity >but youre not a very honest person as with your claim that serbia has no restrictions on the weapons it has sentis serbia sending long range weapons no so its a moot point and serbia is not even sending them directly but through a third party as not to upset russia <number> serbia sells extendedrange grad munitions so theres that <number> so what no restrictions sale is no restrictions sale thosere the best ukraine gets anyway as even uk keeps flipflopping on storm shadow usage<url> >but serbia is okay in your eyes its the us you save your ire for serbia didnt run many rounds of disarmament on ukraine for one claiming that being for safety of ukrainian people or do you not remember the we need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the ukrainian people and people around world by keeping them out of conflicts around the world >it looks like trump will be elected again to the us presidency hell immediately kick off a debate about whether the us should cut off all aid to ukraine as part of his argument hell claim that all ukrainians do is ask for more more more sure its a possibility in other case dripfeed just barely enough to avoid complete collapse for as long as it takes in order to keep up the close fight ie meatgrinder is a complete certainty and theres also a possibility of going loan on it instead of grant<url> if it exceeds current dripfeed rates in either demand available for loan or less throttling usage restrictions itll already be an upgrade for ukraine better to be indebted and armed enough to be alive than debtless and dead because the dripfeed policy sayeth meatgrinder must go on ane russia mustnt be losing too much were reaching the point when it might be better to roll the dice rather than go on with predictable nonescalation that will only grant us slow collapse into a depopulated rump state with no infrastructure surviving and title of paraguay of the st century<url> and apparently duda might also be up to something to weigh that dice towards greater support of ukraine<url>

russia wont push because they know they just have to wait the west out if they push theyll lose or at least lose more than its worth but they can absolutely win a stalemate of attrition against ukraine even if russia loses twice as many soldiers a day as ukraine they still have nearly <number> million more military aged males than ukraine has that arent currently serving,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRm5DeXhwbFFMNTJ5R2Zvd0Y1VTNJRnY1UjJFNkpaSzhqZldIa3MySGwzVW9aZTgxeHNEOFdaTUtZNFJ1SU8wMXh3bmdVVUw4THZ4UUh6X2x3MkFwM2c9PQ==
because this isnt a prediction it is taking data and analyzing it and then extrapolating it but this guy bases his analysis on things such as russia will have <number> million soldiers in <number> to <number> years ok and how will he know that he cannot know how many men russia has lost and will still lose in ukraine i say even another <number> million casualties on the russian side is possible should the war stretch into <number> he also cannot know how many tanks etc russia will still lose and how many more refineries will be hit etc so his analysis is far too limited and mono causal he needs to be more complex and wider and try to asses many angles from history to politics to economics and so and so forth he also has to take chaos factors into account and that the attrition will drastically increase the more weapons ukraine gets he also needs to factor in that by <number> the russian oil and gas sector will have massively shrunk in size and the russian access to capital and skilled labor will shrink as well i doubt he took that all into account and there is more to take into account than that of course and if you want to look <number> years into the future and make such very detailed claims then better do your homework that is not what that other nato guy is doing because he wants to predict human behavior and that is impossible i have economic demographic and military data combined with the state of the russian military their training their logistics etc and that makes the assessment different from claiming nonsense i can for example very well forecast that the decline of russian demographics is going to continue and will accelerate or that the russian budget is unlikely to majorly recover or that their economic model is faltering or that a russian attack on nato is unliky due to the amount of attrition russia took and their production rates just do not support it so i can argue my point very well what speaks against such an attack and the longer russia bleeds cash resources and materiel in ukraine the more unlikely this attack becomes,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQmx0SnNKMzhOLTlYdDZRdlpMcnlMZHVQend0QnpjbDh0M3NidV92cmpxaURjRGpFbVpXcjlVOEhidG1XRW1RSnd4V05zYmFkYjlOallkdUg1SGZ2WFE9PQ==

i think you are looking at it too sober you could have made a similar argument in <number> and <number> and yet here we are thing is russia is maintaining a stream of recruits into their army and is able to be a force despite heavy losses even further they do have enough support india china and iran to shoulder a lot of the impact of sanctions these sanctions are helpful but arent enough russian economy is going into a capsule mode where a lot of commodities are disappearing and are sacrificed for war effort and the industry is gearing up for a long haul this is where problems arise in late stages of wwii when soviets pierced through eastern lines and allies landed in normandy hitler thought that if german people cant defend the fatherland they dont deserve it so soldiers and civilians were sent to crumbling frontlines under duress or straight under a death threat why am i mentioning it cause russian propaganda is already preparing russian population to similar ideas they are already talking why would should exist if russia wouldnt pundits are already saying that this war is an existential struggle cause somehow if they dont win against ukraine their country will cease to exist stupid right on top of that in a year two or three the industry will be near <number> for war effort switching gears will be the same as just stoping the whole countrys economy this might be perceived as an existential threat and the old people holding power in russia could decide to ignite another conflict to fuel the economy or stabilize internal distress so it might be that in <number> or so year they will do something stupid and nato or maybe just europe will be unified enough in their perceived threat of russian occupation that they will respond and the response prolly will be a low intensity action which will prompt russian to respond and so on and by december of <number> we have a frontline from murmansk to minsk would russia have a great chance no would europenato push into russia prolly no cause of danger coming from nuclear weapons and we would have a really strange conflict,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQUtoLWd5dG9WaEJXbWtKZjUtdDBGVjMydUVIb1M4endwZUVpc2s3Z2tGbTdIVzd1a3l1S0JyZHJWM3hkR0kwYjVrTGUwU0NhY2ZNVkFMQXBLUHVhc3c9PQ==

<number> years ago the russian army in ukraine was on the verge of complete collapse putins fear of making an unpopular choice of mobilization and the armys overconfident projections lead to there be way too few russian troops in ukraine to complete the job they were assigned however since ukraine lacked the weapons they needed to punch through they had to pause and that gave the russians enough time to regroup and reinforce the russian army in ukraine is now in a much much better position than they were <number> years ago while they can and should be dislodged the cost to do both in weapons and more crucially ukrainian lives is much higher than if they had been given all the support they needed in february of <number> opportunity cost in war is among the biggest costs you have the west didnt do enough then but we can still do more now,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnems2U1VEdnJiM2EwYnQwRXAyQURzdlk2UG5pajhtekJtX0xlRVNqZ2lRZUI4OW5uaDJDcGNzaDJBcURwNnJNaFRCTWdHS3I2YXBUUGR0SG13SjZRbjZXZHJTa2gxNEVPZ09NN2JPN0RYSms9

from one of the articles you linked so is the war good for the russian economy an analogy by the thcentury french economist frederic bastiat helps to explain why its not bastiat described a boy who has broken a window the boys father pays a glazer to replace it spending the money on goods and services and thus provides a boost to the economy but the assumption that breaking windows is good for economic growth is a fallacy bastiat explains by spending the money on reglazing the window the boys father cant spend it on other goods and services for himself neither more importantly can he spend it on investing in productivity the overall effect is negative albeit possibly a delayed one in russia the broken windows are the armys tanks and missiles producing them round the clock isnt increasing productivity the high demand for workers and difficulties accessing western technology mean russia actually saw a record <number> per cent fall in labour productivity in <number> second only this century to the <number> per cent fall recorded in <number> amid the global economic crisis a slight rebound in <number> failed to bring productivity levels back to prewar levels russia is betting on conquering its way out of an economical pit and have war be profitable in the long run i just dont think they can do that,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneU1ZVjlsZmF4bGpEVUtFb3FIR0FNYlp3YUZ4OTNXWDVsbUpRQU9jLThZZHZjWGp2WlZpTVVrektmLUpJbGxNTGt1a01DRTlBTTR4dVh6XzJxQ0ZLYVE9PQ==

i agree with the concept of focusing on the closer fight in principle but using atacms in russia doesnt violate the principleindeed it reinforces it think of for instance the destruction of the submarine awesome propaganda win cost russia tons of money but destroying a sub that wont be operational for several years doesnt exactly shape todays battlefield if weapons were scarce and someone had to choose the sub or something like a forward command post but not both the best choice is going to be the command post and yes i know that short supply western missiles were used in that attack it was probably allowed because it was such a big strategic score for nato but they arent asking to take the riskyorlooksgoodbutprovidesminimaltacticalbenefit shots the specific act of hitting an airfield logistics or cc hub provides an immediate and potentially disproportionate military advantage and civilian protective effect nato read the us needs to come out with a better excuse than this,r/ukrainianconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneS1IbWN0clBFajNraUZvWFRpUGFHSWQtMXJHY2E1NXNGYmFINTg0UjdScVo4Zy16MFluZHN3cG1uaUhqQnIyWUg2WU44dzhXN2gwMllSVl9SQzdvbWc9PQ==
