with really good tech that seems possible you would need an automated system to send alerts though because a human operator would not be able to calculate that that would require an interconnected system of smart devices that was live tracking every soldiers live position while certainly possible that also seems to be a rather glaring security risk if that should be breached i remember back in ukraines false war with russias obvious proxy forces over the last ten years or so the ukrainian forces had a cellphone app for coordinating artillery the russians successfully hacked into that system and used it to devastate ukrainainian troops for a while until they figured out their system was breached,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRcDVIeGxWNTYzUHVlTkoyNHVacjY4UzRuMEpWUjZMam1hdTJabWRFbHRvdjZ2d0ZjbFJMbFdSdWh0WGVyRjJKQmN6UHR2NS1BMTNUZHpUX1VmMjVoMEE9PQ==

okay im gonna assume youre just ignorant of the whole idea of this war here russias strategic goal is to illegally invade ukraine and annex all its territory for its own gain ukraines strategic objective faced by a larger military force is to hold onto as much territory for as long as possible inflicting attrition based losses with russia having the greater losses whilst ukraines retreats when it it tactically and strategically necessary you have two goals there that fundamentally ensure russia is going to gain land and ukraineis most likely going to be losing it  also since the beginning of the war russia has stalled and within what <number> years has advanced km from the peoples republics ,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXSDZiSHF2MTB6dmFycTdLUldqQWNrdi1TQ2NKOXpaZmUtemNWVXRoaDFGMGJDeXo1ZHdhc1BPNzQzSHV1TG5yVEkzSHRsVVlZMGU3ODJ3a2pxYzBxNmVyZk9BbVVQenJiV1JJMXJ5YTJhMlU9

eah russia did struggle at the start mostly because for <number> reasons <number> massively underestimating their enemy this wasnt the ukraine of <number> ~<cur><number> billion from eu and ~<cur><number> billion from usa in military supplies and funding helped them modernise their military they had built a massive network of fortifications and defensive lines and were well prepared for the invasion this wasnt some outdated military like iraq and this isnt including the ~<number> billion in mostly frontline nato equipment they received in <number> and <number> <number> not mobilising after their initial smo failed russia only invaded with around ~<number> soldiers with at most ~<number> if you include ukrainians mercenaries and foreign fighters ukraine had around <number> in active service already and mobilised ~<number> in <number> even when coalition invaded iraq which was a far far inferior military they had a near <number><number> ratio of soldiers even now russia only has around ~<number> soldiers in ukraine if you account for logistics maintenence and infantry russia cant even have half of its military in ukraine going off on how much equipment they have how many people it takes to operate and how many on average is required for support and logistics along with having a reasonable amount of infantry by these estimates russua has somewhere in between <number><number> of its military mostly land force in ukraine so probably ~<number> total military assets <number> even with failures of the smo in <number> they did well they captured mariupol and several ukrainian cities and towns within a month or so the problem was they didnt have the men so they likely had to withdrawn from many areas then there was the fact that they left most of the kharkov region to dpr and lpr troops who are mostly just infantry so when ukraine launched its counter offensive they easily swept by russuan defences there was also the issue they didnt have great logistics at the starr things were going bad at best fir russia it was stale mate and at worst it was losing but in late <number> the army was reorganised a partial mobilisation of around ~<number><number> reservists was made they fixed their logistics and supply lines they built proper fortifications with multiple defensive lines and they upped their aviation brought in lots of ss and ss and undertook major sead operations to gain air superiority and brought the rest of their black sea fleet to secure naval supremacy ukraine on the other hand was taking its time they had spent months training with nato they received over <number> billion in financial aid military supplies and human tian aid from western countries and organisations months of training with nato equipment they received nearly <number> nato air defence systems hundreds of nato anti aircraft guns and over <number> nato manpads including thousands of others to help them punch a whole in russia air superiority to get some momentum they received tens of thousands of nato atgms and nearly <number> nato tanks and thousands of nato ifvs apcs ew systems radars counter batteries spags artillery guns etc and dozens of aircraft including attack helicopters and fighter jets along with millions of shells missiles rockets mines and hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition and nearly half a million nato small arms and remember a lot of thus was top stuff masa leopard a cv krab archer himars javelin storm shadow stinger c ma pirioun patriot pac<number> gem+ sampt nasams<number> irist slm akeron mp milaner rosomak maods etc is all minimum frontline nato equipment and practically every bit has been destroyed at least once their counter offensive was to split the russian army and capture ~<number>km out of around ~<number>km it was too liberate crimea and prove to the world just how superior western weapons were it was a colossal failure ~<number> billion in military supplies ~<number> billion in financial aid months of training access to the best intelligence nato has battle plans coordinated with top nato commanders and in nearly <number> months of fighting it only caught less than ~km or around less than <number> of their target they couldnt even breath the <number><number> defensive line and spent <number> months fighting for a single street village which by the way was taken back by russia last month all the hype and ukraine still lost km in <number> overall despite their offensive almost immediately after they realised they were just sending meat to an unbreakable wall russia launched its offensive in november since then it has captured nearly ~km according to averages by suriah maps deep state ua and rybar they have captured numerous cities towns and villages theyve opened up a new front in the north and are advancing on all fronts ukraine had around a million men fighting in <number> yet its top generals are saying it needs <number> men just to keep fighting and are talking about their seventh mobilisation yet apparently theyve only lost <number>  meanwhile russua according to unbiased media zonal has lost ~<number> and <number><number> if you count all those fighting for them russias economy is up inflation is down and they are outproducing the west in shells and are producing equipment at a staggering rate in <number> they undertook a massive modernization campaign to upgrade old tb tb and tm tanks in storage and upgraded nearly ~<number> of them to tb tbm tbm tbvm and tmv this on top of the <number><number> tm they build every year ukraines only successes are firing hundreds of rockets drones and missiles at russia every day then when get through have their media leak it to western media and make propaganda about how this shows how bad russian air defence systems are when in reality its like shooting an m at a target and hitting all around but clipping a couple seconds where you hit the target and saying see how good a shot i am ignoring that most your shots missed if you genuinely cared about ukrainians like i do youd want this war to end ignore propaganda russua is not some cartoon evil they are bad just like ukraine although both are more moral than how us conducts warfare thats for sure but again both are bad both commit atrocities against eachother both target areas with high civilians with little care and both are guilty of having funked up laws peace is whats needed let russia keep the annexed areas ukraine keeps its military doesnt join nato russia and ukraine can get to rebuilding

no russia should not get to just keep the annexed areas thats stupid and russia has no right to dictate what and what not ukraine does because its a sovereign free country and half of what you said just isnt true ukraine hasnt received that much aid its received about <number> billion in military aid and a very infrequent amount of arms and equipment as for shells thats ridiculous you would even try to claim ukraine has been given millions on millionsthey had a shell shortage for literally half the conflict only up until recently has the czech initiative given ukraine sufficient shells its strange that russia doesnt have enough men  maybe if they didnt use meat wave tactics to try obtain incremental gains then they would have had the men also to say ukraine was prepared is ludicrous in the areas around the people republics sure thats true thats why they held out so long but in other areas ukraine completely failed and allowed russia to take more land than it shouldve and zelenskyy has been criticised for that you actually are coping saying that and at least one has been destroyed of them all  like what this is a war things get destroyed also ukraine doesnt commit an active bombing campaign on a city like kiev targeting civilian infrastructure also dont even try claim the northern offensive is anything but a failure now it serves no strategic purpose for the russians like it was meant to and its quite hilarious seriously you are just spitting straight misinformation here ,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXdkY0YUFLbG9VVmdkQy1lNEMxMlZUMDRpMmV4OXlRS3NsTEdBQmJaZFhuT094b3IyWXItTzd2c2xPNDh3TWM2SnBLWWJHYW1PSjQ3eW9VRDR6NFJMazNLVDdrc0hmeDJoQ2RWWXp6cW5TZW89

and if you are operating roving artillery where slit trenches are not dug each time for protection to initiating firing then what is the solution did anyone every discuss heavy kevlar blankets that can be grabbed and troops lay on the ground and cover or something similar in some case artillery troops have only a few seconds to take cover such as there is cover what do they do at present hide behind the artillery pieces which are the center target,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXYXdlLU43R1VhUHlpQWpTM0RvOUZTdzN1c2JNaHRzY1RyUGU1WTFxZHM2S1VXN1BYYXNhQ3JtVnBBMmNFVEl4LWhxaWV5bjV0RjBCN1d4TkZESENwS25zMHczbGdVSkNPaHJBalE4Z3VpakU9

yk if you open the exact link you just sent me and you look at the next line it says <number> billion direct military aid just like i said the initial invasion was repelled by not western trained ukrainian troops they did that all on their own and russian troops were forced to retreat due to the fierce resistance to more favourable areas western armour has been proven to be more effective efficient and successful than russian armour casualties figures represent this massively and there are countless videos of the opposite systems going head to head the counter offensive didnt fail it succeeded in many strategic goals it was just inflated to be this large liberation that was going to occur which was in no way realistic russians had developed incredibly well prepared fortified positions and repelled ukrainian forces russia has made no significant gains literally anywhere across the frontline they are achieving most success along the eastern front and they are being slaughtered just to move <number> inch further onto ukrainian territory the new offensive from the north into kharkiv has failed massively it not only hasnt even began to make its supposed buffer zone but its barely captured multiple towns and they are actively fighting over vovchansk in a battle they are struggling so badly to win their logistics are heavily disrupted the losses are projected by multiple sources to be <number><number><number><number> in the area of the new offensive russia has been battered and it will most likely lose vovchansk if the ukrainian counter offensive succeeds oh and if the russians are so successful and so mighty whos in krynky youre stating opinions as if theyre factual dude youre also misquoting the ukrainian soldiers they said basic training they were getting was rarely applicable in trench warfare because thats not what they were teaching because it hasnt been used by a western power since forever russia is putting its entire economy at <number> to uphold the war and i the terrorist regime the west and nato havent sent everything at <number> and i assure you if they did you would know about it hopefully due to the uks new pm and other recent politicians advocating for ukraine we can see support skyrocket and putin can shove his big red button up his arse ,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYd0RGQXRHSktQU1VmT001WXR4RnFEUVFMU0xEcEYyUkhTdThzLUxTbTFJVzJ5V1NMSjJCU1MzWHNIVnVmYXJEUFZrUnhPQjAwNmczSHh3T2tSSjFTVjF6cjUxOEJRN21vWTJLdWZ3dTJBRnM9
again your entire argument is cope phahahajahaha succeed even western propaganda admits it failed lmao  zelensky and ukraine said the counter offensive was to retake crimea <url> <url> <url> <url> it achieved absolutely nothing ukraine had around <number> billion in military supplies <number>+ tanks <number>+ ifvs and apcs <number>+ manpads hundreds of air defence systems and anti aircraft guns with tens of thousands of atgms along with months of nato training and months of preparations with access to best nato intelligence and commanders and your offensive was an absolute failure you spent <number> months fighting for a single street village lmao this year russia on the other hand naval wise is set to receive its upgraded kuznetsov class fleet carrier and kirov class guided missile battlecruiser that was set to replace the old slava class cruiser moskva that ukraine destroyed along with yasenm class submarine buyanm class corvette admiral gorshkov destroyer steregushchiyclass frigate admiral grigorovich frigate ivan grenclass amphibious ship ladaclass submarine gremyashchiyclass frigate and karakurtclass corvette and of course its new stealth frigate is being tested having not long been launched army wise russia could mobilise another <number> reserves putting the total number in ukraine at over <number> million troops russian forces in ukraine have also started receiving first batches of the <number> upgraded rd gen tanks pulled from storage and retrofitted including tb tum<number> and tm tanks along with <number> freshly built <number> gen tm and around a

new rd gen s sm s s spags sand around <number> new nd gen tornados and uraganm gmlrs launchers and new rd gen tos<number> and tornadog along with nd gen tosa mlrs launchers to be delivered to forces in ukraine air force wise russia also has several new aircraft being built with around <number>+ new total aircraft encompassing <number><number> aircraft a month with sus sus mig<number> minm yak<number> and kam along with several new upgraded versions being done such as mipnm tumm tumsm au tum susm sum susm susm migbsm and migk being delivered and of course russia says its new th gen su<number> will be showcased in <number> along with its new unmanned stealth bomber and rd gen aewc aircraft being put into production this year with the s<number> okhotnikb and a<number> they could use ukraine as a more meaty testing ground for it to drum up interests like they did for their t<number> armata kurganets<number> and su<number> instead of just syria which is against poorly armed and trained rebels and terrorists similar to afghan and iraqi insurgents either way this war has turned into russias vietnam that being russia hoped for fast victory but through good defiance and massive military aid and fighting by proxy it has turned into a protracted conflict of course the big difference here being that ukraine has had more funding than russia whereas usa and arvn was x better funded than the nva and russia is wrecking ukraine where as vietnam wrecked usa but again its irrelevant russia is smashing ukraine even according to suriah maps and deep state ua russia is gaining ground every single day they have complete artillery superiority and air superiority russia has still only had one mobilisation meanwhile ukraine who has lost over half a million men is pushing parliament for their seventh your entire argument is pure fucking copium and just denying reality even the general in charge of the krynky operation has been arrested because he was just sending human waves to their deaths western armour has proven to be absolutely useless <number> billion worth thousands of vehicles and did absolutely nothing <number> months ukraine fought for and yet they still lost km in <number> you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about you dont have the slightest understanding about warfare ukraines economy is all but finished and will struggle to recover without massive economic aid with around <number> drop in economic output post war with a drop of <number> this quarter however imf are predicting a <number> increase for <number> and cpi inflation at <number> with its gdp nominal at <cur><number> billion and ppp <cur><number> billion at and its gdp nominal per capita at <cur><number> and per capita ppp <cur><number> it also has very large debts of around <cur><number> billion to the imf world bank european union and united states expected to rise to <cur><number> billion by end of <number> along with its massively diminished labour force its defence budget is <number> of gdp nominal and <number> of tax revenue its hryvnia has been devalued <number><number> post war and of course naturally as result of the war its market cap has entirely tanked and foreign investment has been cut by around post war when the war in ukraine is over ukraine is facing a very tough challenge estimates for the cost of rebuilding ukraine range from <cur><number> billion to over <cur><number> trillion and this isnt counting the massive debts its incurred from military and financial aid packages if russia wins its likely they will rebuild as they have extensively rebuilt mauriopl luhansk and many towns and cities far from frontlines based on video and picture evidence likely as ploy to get the civilian population on their side or could be as putin said they dont want to destroy ukraine just remove its regime russias economy is doing relatively well especially considering being sanctioned by two economic superpowers with net growth of around <number> post war after losing <number> in <number> with a growth of <number> this quarter and cpi inflation at <number> with a gdp nominal of ~<cur><number> trillion and gdp ppp of ~<cur><number> trillion with gdp ppp per capita at <cur><number> and per capita nominal at <cur><number> however due to said sanctions from the united states and european union it is now in sovereign default with the imf world bank and western creditors and thus its market cap and foreign investment has tanked and its rouble has been devalued around <number><number> its defence budget is <number>

in a vacuum we could calculate pretty accurately there would be some error because measurements of speed and direction would have tiny errors that get magnified over long distances but the real kicker is air longrange snipers have to measure the wind at multiple points along the path to hit the target i expect artillery has a similar problem not saying its impossible just that its harder than it looks,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYLVlReko5a0R3MmZSakdBYmJfLVk0V1NkdjMxOEd5WERBajFtZGU0ZmlqSTF6SlRqVTlFakVGX216VG1XZjFjdmNVUzk3S3hJOWE2ZGs0RHVIMWR5Nnc9PQ==

the conflict is primarily between two sides the pkk kurdistan workers party and the turkish government since <number> when the british and french divided the middle east into countries following the fall of the ottoman empire they did not draw borders that accounted for ethnic groups like the kurds the french and british promised the kurds an independent state which would be located between iran iraq and turkey borders today even though the territory where kurds were the majority living and historically was much bigger but they broke their promise because the turks werent happy about it and said they would attack the state the british and french didnt want another conflict in the region because ww had just ended so they wrote an agreement called the treaty of lausanne in <number> between the british french and turkish that formed todays middle east borders this is why there are always conflicts in the region for <number>+ years the turkish government has been oppressing minorities especially the kurds they have killed thousands of kurds and imprisoned many more and even today this is ongoing they banned the kurdish language culture clothes and everything related to kurds and a kurdish state in <number> a kurdish party appeared that was led by apo abdullah ocalan it was a political party at first that was asking for rights for the kurdish people but they knew they were far from getting their rights like that so they turned the party into a military one which started to attack the turkish government in kurdish territories in southeast turkey the turkish government deployed many troops in the kurdish territories and the conflict has gone on for nearly <number>+ years the pkk backed up into another part of kurdish territory in the region north iraq which we call south kurdistan because kurds believe kurdistan is much bigger than the area that the british and the french marked for a kurdish state theres a large kurdish population all the way from the persian gulf to the black sea to the iskenderun port in south turkey to the persian gulf again you can search kurdistan map on google so kurdistan is actually not only in southeast turkey and the conflict isnt only between the kurds and the turks but it is much bigger kurdistan was divided into <number> main parts turkey iran iraq and syria turkey north kurdistan iran east kurdistan iraq south kurdistan syria west kurdistan in all <number> parts kurdish people were oppressed and subjected to genocide by all <number> countries for more than <number> years especially by saddam hussein in iraq search anfal on google which is a genocide done by saddam hussein in turkey iran and syria kurds also faced racism turkish people used to call kurds in turkey mountain turks because they were simply denying kurdish existence even today fortunately today kurds have two independent regions in both syria and iraq kurdistan region and the autonomous administration of north and east syria aanes also known as rojava which means west in kurdish they both did great work fighting isis islamic state of iraq and the levant terrorist organization in <number><number> with the help of the usa and international allies and both regions are democratic regions where all middle eastern ethnicities and religions live peacefully together going back to the main discussion the pkk is now mainly active in northern iraq south kurdistan kurdistan region so the turkish government is unhappy hearing about these two kurdish regions in the region and continuously attacks both since their establishment theyre using the pkk as an excuse to attack both regions and bomb them so kurds fight back against these attacks and invasions the pkk is also labeled as a terrorist organization by the us eu because their ally turkey says so in fact there is evidence and even videos where turkish soldiers give weapons and equipment to isis so isis can take the kurdish city of kobane in <number> meanwhile the pkk had participated in most of the fights against isis so now there are more than <number> turkish bases in south kurdistan mountains and kurdish fighters attack them meanwhile turkish jets and drones attack kurdish cities in both syria and iraq continuously recently the pkk started attacking turkish bases with drones which i think is a good tactic to reduce their losses they have a website where they post their videos attacking turkish soldiers and positions called gerilla tv <url> you can check it out so yes were basically fighting for our land and rights while everyone in the world is talking about palestine because theyre a muslim nation as if the kurdish population isnt <number> muslim or wasnt many kurds have started to leave islam in recent years including myself there are many christian kurds in the kurdistan region and many kurdish jews live in israel i personally support israel because arabs and muslims call kurds and some brainwashed kurds also call each other brothers because of their religion meanwhile arabs turks and muslims have been killing and bombing us for <number> years and even today europeans americans and even israelis are the only people who really cared about us and supported us and there are many kurds who love israelis and americans even though the americans abandoned us as a result of a command from trump to pull their troops from syria so the turks could invade us which they failed to do even after that while isis and turkishbacked militias attack kurdish cities and forces continuously kurdish forces in syria are guarding hundreds of thousands of foreign isis fighters in alsina prison and their families and children in alhol camp becoming a real threat to the region when turkishbacked militias attacked the prison two years ago hundreds escaped and even the european and asian countries where the isis members are from do not take their people back because they think of them as a threat they think its okay to leave them here without giving the region any economic or military support to guard the prison there are more than <number> isis fighters in the prison and <number> women and children of the isis fighters in the camp if we execute them the un would get mad meanwhile if it were us prisoners in isis hands we would have already been executed so yes i hope you have got your answer about whos the bad side and whos the good side,r/war,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZ2c5SDN0b2VCdzlGN0RZdWNiRWI3UzF3bzdhQ2R4Vnp0ZHRWM2lUbXhFNjBYZV9hU1A3RXRHNnNReGIyNUI3MEN6QXZxS1E0dnVubWF6bDFrVXh4S3c9PQ==
