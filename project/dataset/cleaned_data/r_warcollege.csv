i would imagine that it hasnt been talked about because there isnt much to say i think that largely has to do simply with the fact that there is little opportunity or training to maximize the effects of small arms advancement economically speaking there simply isnt much new stuff available to ukrainians that would allow them to assess new weapons advancements theyve got a shitload of aks and hand me down nato weapons but only top tier guys get the good stuff and even then it probably isnt anything that didnt get heavily tested during the gwot most troops probably dont have the training or experience to maximize small arms capability if you hand a newbie a total beast of a rifle its not going to be much more useful than a stock ak because they dont have the marksmanship skills to take advantage of its benefits besides that small arms just dont seem to account for that many casualties in the grand scheme of things it would be a poor use of time and resources to experiment with small arms advancements rather than small drone advancements because new rifles wouldnt have nearly as much impact as a bunch of small drones or jamming technology or something almost all of the footage ive seen where small arms are actually being used are happening either as blind suppressive fire or magdumping into a bunker and you dont need anything fancy to do that its possible there are some elite sniper teams or something that are pushing the envelope with their small arms but i imagine they are few and far between in all honestly small arms technology really hasnt advanced much in the last <number> years anyhow so theres not much to talk about when compared with the massive leaps and strides that are happening with drones air defense hypersonic missiles and electronic warfare any commentary about small arms would be very nitpicky and probably only comprehensible to serious professionals so its not going to get picked up in the media much anyhow,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeFFwTzFHenJkRjZnMFh1b244eXBwdm1ubWs5Ty10UFhrUmlKSWdmbHBrSWdRNVFjVzhUQWpVdVJ3SGtBNU5iWlZIbVczMjVld1VnRzVyZjY2T2o1Qmc9PQ==

because artillery is not as good as missiles anymore on ships even at gun ranges km or less usually for most naval artillery missiles are more accurate and usually have greater power to them their downside is that they are easier to target in most cases except for maybe hypersonics possessed only by a few countries and take more space on the ship but their upsides are greater this is to say nothing about naval aviation but this too is not every country but most countries with even the assets to perform a naval invasion usually have ships with more missiles than guns,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZzNrNERlREs3eEhHbzY3anlTd2c5Q0hrS0ozdzFxYW5EMUFiQUxSNnB2N3dXaWlrOEIzNncxUWVNcndiREF0QUxNbEkzQ2tzYmRfM1ZXcEdTZkdzUGxkNy1XTkxBX1VQVXNneGpHc2hwODQ9

i can give my first hand experience from being us soldier deployed to afghanistan in the <number><number> timeframe there wasnt any big army policy about trying to have soldiers learn the language there was a small amount of cultural sensitivity training we went through each time before deploying a lot of junior leaders like team and squad leaders would try and teach their soldiers some basic phrases before we went overseas simple things like saying hello how are you or where are the taliban before my second deployment in <number> our unit sent about <number> guys through a language course that was about <number> months long to have them learn the local language unfortunately they sent our guys to a dari course and then we deployed to a pashto speaking area again so the guys who went through the course could only really talk to the afghan army guys who were with us because they were generally dari speakers as far as interpreters who we called terps it was a pretty mixed bag they went through a vetting process though i cant say what that all entailed some of our terps were highly motivated and wanted to help us defeat the taliban one had lost family to them and we trusted him enough to let him carry a captured ak and ammo bandolier we had another terp that most of us were convinced was either working for the taliban or at least sympathetic towards them the timing of his phone calls home and taliban mortar attacks was always suspicious and whenever he want out on patrols with us they taliban wouldnt shoot at that patrolits also highly likely this was just a rumor and some of our guys looking for someone to blame most of the terps were somewhere in between sorta just there for the paycheck and not super motivated sometimes the taliban would find the identity of terps and use that to threaten the family of the terps in order to coerce them into passing along information or even carrying out insider attacks when i was deployed during <number><number> there was some threat of insider attacks but nothing extreme when i was deployed again in <number> there was a very high risk of insider attacks one of our sister companies had one very early in the deployment that resulted in <number> kia and several wounded that was carried out by an ana soldier and a local that he helped to sneak onto the outpost i seem to remember a lot of the insider attacks we heard of were carried out by members of the afghan security forces though i wouldnt be surprised if some were carried out by interpreters too,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeHpEN0daM0RMbU8zaGFwY0wzYjMtOURBNkpuNF9aUU9FTkxOdkdKcEtLdmU4Q1NRckdkMW9VczVvY2FOaVo3SE44akQzRWNXY2t1NFZWNlNMYmxYMVE9PQ==

in addition to the dearth of aircraft engine development and materials to make them as was mentioned by uinceptor very correctly as a primary driver of lackluster aircraft development there are human factors happening as well the imperial navy especially didnt have the pilots or the training capacity to adequately prepare rookie pilots for flying machines that were much hotter and more difficult to handle such as dys ams and bas prewar pilot training programs were so difficult that they were lucky if they had <number> pilots out of a graduating class this set them up for failure when they finally did desperately need pilots some of these aircraft were much too large for the smaller and slower japanese carriers the converted ocean liners junyo and hiyou couldnt even launch the dy suisei unless they could find a knot headwind somewhere then even if a rookie pilot did manage to take off with these more unstable machines many of them had never even made a carrier landing before much less been under sustained aaa and fighter sweeps the result was more than <number> planes and aircrew destroyed and killed in the philippine sea west southwest of saipan why make nice improved aircraft when the framework to train the pilots has been gutted rookie pilots are more likely to crash due to the increased performance then they were to benefit from it its worth comparing the corsair in this regard because it was undoubtedly one of the finest fighter aircraft of the war but it was also like a bucking bronco and demanded expertise from the pilot to control the torque put out by that r<number> double wasp after the turkey shoot it was laid bare in ighq and st air fleet that conventional methods of attack were no longer effective against american warships youre just gonna get shot down so thats the genesis of shinpukamikaze tactics if youre gonna kamikaze then again there is no need for a new aircraft just get whatever you can and pack it full of explosives anything else is a waste of money and materials the army didnt quite have as many problems in these regards but they had the same problem concerning trained aviators they didnt have to contend with the inherent difficulty and danger of naval aviation so they did have more success in using newer aircraft landing on a runway is far far easier than a carrier and they didnt have deck limitations like the navy so they had a few late war aircraft that were newer both the ki<number> and ki<number> aircraft were newer and fairly capable but the <number> suffered engine problems consistently the ki<number> was designed with an imported inverted inline db <number> engine and then a domestic copy called the ha<number> the domestic copies suffered from lots of reliability problems however which led to the ki<number> it by some miracle did not suffer from many of the same engine problems they pulled the ha<number> and retrofitted the frame to accept a radial engine that was derived from the venerable pratt and whitney r<number> hornet which is a wonderfully reliable engine and their copy was not hot trash like others had been too little too late however all the major leaps in aircraft design were ultimately thanks to new and better engines japan as you can see had serious problems keeping pace with engine designs and that limited how good the aircraft they made were,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYM291VjU4ckNOdGJqamRMSGU4S3hqaDFHWjRYRXBhdGEweFhnNm0wUXp0ajdJcmFJM0FHb1dEMlBIRHZvd2pUak1oMkZXbWlOaXE0YVJQcUc1SjZmbGc9PQ==

its something of a catch <number> they lack experience so dont conduct battalionbrigadelevel attacks so dont gain experience so lack experience etc the issue is experience with companylevel actions isnt always directly transferable to higherechelon operations undoubtedly there are ukrainian company officers who are now more experienced with modern mechanized warfare as has been practiced in ukraine than any of their nato peers however they have much less if any experience with staff work or in organising and coordinating tasks specific to higherechelons of command nor do their men have experience fighting as part of such a force these are skills most armies build up in peace time through regular exercises wargames and staff colleges but ukraines focus on rapidly reorganising and expanding the army and its operational experience prior to <number> being relatively lowintensity conflict in donbas led to disproportionate experience with companylevel operations in fairness this is something a lot of modern armies would likely struggle with as well since this scale of action was deemphasised after <number> but ukraines unique circumstances make the issue particularly acute throw in steady attrition due to casualties evolving tacticstechnology dilutiondivision of experienced units as the army expands shifting operational focus culture clash between natotrained junior officers and their soviettrained bosses and its difficult to gather and drill a larger force together long enough to build up the skills relationships and competencies necessary to conduct more complex operations,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY2w4eWFfaWtQMDZ0cGZ4MTJHY3E4WWp0b2lWa0JLTjczb2JreVBndzMtcjNsWVpMVU9iRW1UQldFV0pleWRGSjZTWnFQTExNNlVtamg5OHE0SFZPZ3c9PQ==

the find fix and finish kill chain is simply so dangerous in modern warfare that infantry need to fight like this because otherwise youre simply inviting fire support assets to attack you russia in the early days of the war did movements in its large formation style of manoeuvre like soviet doctrine calls for but realised to do that means large ammo and fuel depots that were constantly being destroyed to counter this they made them smaller and further from the front line but as a result you can only support small groups one could argue that fighting as an insurgent is just taking this survival tactic to the extreme,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYclFYYmo0NGNCSTg1U0NHQzVOdUs3MFM2eVdoN05SMkFPcDFLdGhJa3NuQXBJMmVwalpnTENzTnVRajRhNTQ5TFRPd3pUVWwtTl9TSV93UkVhZ3dqTFE9PQ==

i think one analyst im going to credit it to michael kofman but it was either war on the rocks or the russia contingency said the lack of barbed wire is because of a proliferation of irnight vision equipment even on drones historically the safest time to lay wire was at night but this is no longer the case and any soldiers who try are exposed so they just dont lay it that might not be the case if theyre constructing defensive positions away from the front line but im not certain regarding smoke shells at least one cause has been the use of drones by commanders for situational awareness if smoke is used they lose this awareness so they dont use it,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY2g3d2t3d0FfV2VNc3JHMnVlTjlya0h3c1ZKMzFOME1VWFJzcnh2MFJ2eW5TNGxaVE16SlFqZHdwLWtNMVZ1emJQOTI0czJmRmpnbm56SE9fNjFCTlE9PQ==

i have extended material on this because of my dissertation which i will be handing in within a few weeks the us army found them useful but was worried about the early stage of development and use outside of welldeveloped major population centers with wellmaintained roads basically the fear was that the moment you take them to lessdeveloped areas like mexico or somewhere in the pacific they would become unusable a good article on early experiments can be found in the infantry journal by john h sherburne automobile guns in the massachusetts maneuvers vol <number> no <number> p <number> sherburne wrote a lengthy essay on the use of civilian cars for troop movement and heavy weapons support he was optimistic about it but the prewar army had major funding problems basically much like aviation the army understood that motorization was going to play a major role in the next war but either didnt have the money to invest in motor pools becuase of the high upfront cost to essentially overhaul your entire logistics system or because they didnt want to invest in something that was constantly being improved on imagine people who are fretting over getting the iphone <number> but wanting to wait for the iphone <number> which will be out within a few months and offer better specs for the same money army officers were also some of the highest paid individuals in the country and comfortably upper middle class the only people who made more were their relatives who worked as private sector executives even companygrade officers were in the upper <number> of income and were some of the first to afford private motor vehicles george patton even if he hadnt come from money would easily have been able to afford his private vehicle that early experience with private vehicles got many younger officers comfortable with cars and they were put to good use during the punitive expedition in <number> some articles in the service journals also called for the army to register every vehicle sold in the country so that they could be pressed into service mind you this was way before <number> when parisian taxis were used as adhoc troops transport by <number> the problem was that the army had in the eyes of some like lieutenant colonel wr conolly invested too much into slapdash acquisitions of every type of vehicle which left the army with a massive motor pool of soontobe obsolete vehicles of all types and another massive upfront investment to modernize which the peacetime army never did you can read more about that in field artillery vol <number> no <number> p <number> motor transportation for artillery,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQlJ1ZHVLenU0STJFTDVmMGxhUmhSQWtsOHJNS19uLWIzN0U2cFFuaEJnLTlCdGM3MkxXN0pzbmFuTDRzZzFVZlpGZmYzaWNieW5GdnkyZnlldERoNGQzS1hQS1RROC1YUzNmanpMNHZ5WWM9

despite the popular image of ww being a war where old donkeys led millions of young lions to their needless deaths because they were too dumb too conservative too britishfrenchgermanrussian to adapt to change reality was that ww generals were very innovative and adaptive one could even argue that it was the general of ww and later wars who were less adaptive and innovative than a ww general for these generals had the benefits of experiences developed tech advanced economy and still make mistakes i am looking at you american generals who sent hundred of gis to their early grave because they forgot ied was a thing and humvee could do crap about it despite the vietnamese teaching them a very good lesson about ied thirty years prior but i am ahead of myself back to ww the thing about truck in ww was that it was new technology for comparison a truck with internal combustion engine appeared <number> years before ww it was a new untested unproved technology that was prohibitively expensive the price of a daimler motor lastwagen was <number> german mark in <number> now my math may be off here but according to stephen bulls german machine guns of ww when the german asked for a test maxim gun in <number> the price was <number> pounds per gun from the best of my ability i was able to find that in <number> <number> british pound = <number> german marks so a test machine gun was <number> marks give or take price may be lower as time goes on and production scale with such high price and unreliable tech an army would be forgiven to ignore the trucks especially when you had other more important things to take care of stuffs like say machine guns which had proven murderously effective in the russojapanese war and yet they invested heavily in truck according to james m lauxs truck in the west during the first world war during the <number><number> period the german factories could only produce <number> trucks in total and yet when the german army invaded belgium it brought with it hundreds of trucks didnt seem like a lot of trucks until you realized aeven as few as <number> trucks represented <number> of all trucks produced in the entire of germany in two years bthe germans had to spend a lot of money on other things to like building a navy or maintaining an army for twofront war by the end of <number> the german army had <number> trucks the french growth was more spectacular before the war they had <number> trucks by august <number> they had <number> trucks by <number> when the battle of verdun happened the french had a fleet of <number> trucks moving <number> tons of supplies and <number> men along the sacred road each week they produced so many trucks that if one truck broke down they shoved it off the road and this was france a country whose entire coal region had been lost to the german in the franco prussian war whose industrial heartland in the northeast was by <number> in german hand the military commanders of that time did not stop there they saw through the backwardness of horses and immediately sought to replace those big foolish fourlegged things wherever they could needed to pull a field gun why the french produced some <number> trucks just to pull field gun got muddy terrain to go through holt tractor company got you covered oh your guns needed to hit the kraut but private johnny was too illiterate to make a precise shot from <number> meter away why pack your gun onto your tractor drive up there and introduce the kaiser to your mm gun putting guns on truck was how we get to tanks in the first place shooting down pesky zeppelin slap some guns onto your trucks fuck horses fuck cavalry too those guys are gay given their lack of technology and past experience along with the modernity and some may say exoticness of the tech the generals of ww embraced the truck heartedly to the best of the ability of their countrys economy,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQWV3NUFXSF9kQ0liOFRYbzhPWldzTmpwcG9zdVRyVFNkYmVEUGNnZUZvbWZfc3ZQVi1iOGZYUGFoX1dkaWxaTDlJakdvS1Y3dFRMZGttVTZiU1Zhd0stNVBLRmRrbHRsODF0RndZYXNvUE09

i think another key aspect is that there were massive formations in the beginning in the original maneuver warfare we saw columns of vehicles pouring in however without air dominance or efficient logistics the stubborn ukrainian defense turned this into a stalemate but dont put the cart before the horse a large reason were in a stalemate is because neither side can field effective large formations neither side has the stamina skill or air power to pull it off thats how we got here and why we will stay here its possible see large formations and maneuver warfare if one side was able to build up an excess of skilled penetration divisions with air power but then we wouldnt be in a stalemate i used to subscribe to the whole drones see everything and thats why you cant do large formations but i now believe thats just a symptom of two sides who really cant offensively dominate eachother realize that and are stuck in this situation now where they need to expend the least amount of troops over time,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZejltU0hITnZlNHl3VnZNam9sVXdtYlZtaGtCcERzOHRDVlNUVVMxaGF5cWlxUHVuM3VWbG96UXlGNzZDTEZzbzFvNWlSNWxXc2FKZ3pOSFpQdjhwcWc9PQ==
yes that was one big problem that required a skilled pilot it was also very easy for torque drift on the flight deck to send aircraft off the side which is why its early service was mostly vmf squads as opposed to navy ones the huge propeller only barely cleared the deck and wouldnt have cleared at all without the gull wing a propeller strike on a hard landing was quite possible the pilot was far back compared to other aircraft and the taxiing characteristics really suffered because of how little the pilot could see over the long nose it also leaked like a sieve and if you have ever seen a historical photo and noticed white lines over the engine and radiator panels that was surgical tape they used to try and keep liquids in the damn engine rather than leaking everywhere in return though you get a plane called whistling death by enemies and in the hands of a skilled pilot like pappy boyington its a serious killing machine,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcWxrbEF0RWlZZjNrVHJuXzVpSmlUcmc0dGpNN0FSOUZ6OWpBbDRIYUZqYlBQX1M1ZDMwMnpfSjlOZmZQcjU3THU5X0JleEUwczlhaWtJdFotWmtCeHc9PQ==

the official army answer was that awgs functions could be replicated by other organizations within the army and they wanted to shift the funding and resources elsewhere i remember speaking to someone i know who was in awg around the time they shut the unit down iirc he said it was because the army wanted to move those positions elsewhere the army cant add positions in one place without subtracting them from another and honestly awg was probably low hanging fruit from the armys perspective while it was pivoting to follow the armys refocus on peer level conflict vs the coin fight it was likely seen as a gwot era creation full of senior ncoo slots that the army needed somewhere else so they cut it,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNjE1TUt4emNNc0VzN0FqOThPdlFFOVRNMlhvVDJzc3JrLTNMZjNWVllIblo1VWpEUWZzand5TE5CWlR1Uk9TVDNWdzlQVi1ZRkx4RVdEMTNoVzk1dHc9PQ==

contrary to media depiction special forces units are not just really fit guys who shoot good they are really fit guys who shoot good with an incredibly complicated and unique tasking the ranger regiment toes the line in mission sets where regular conventional infantry would be out of their depth but other special forces units could not field a large enough force to handle the job they are typically assigned direct action missions against important targets think seizing an airfield rangers are organized to fight at battalion strength but in austere environments this also made them incredibly capable as a qrf force which they were widely used as in afghanistan green berets in order to be a green beret one needs to speak a second language this often comes with cultural education on the region they are supposed to be operating in they are tasked with liasing with local forces in a combat environment in order to accomplish some mission in vietnam this was advizing the south vietnamese in afghanistan after <number><number> working with the northern coalition to attack the taliban and call in airstrikes depicted in the movie <number> strong delta forces mission sets are intentionally not disclosed interestingly it is rumored that delta actively seeks out both men and women for their ranks hinting at a specialization in special reconnaissance kinda suspicious for a bunch of fit dudes to be staking out an hvts home but not for a man and wife to just be driving arround an area i just want it known i am not an expert and i do expect those more knowledgable to be posting better explanations but i thought id jump in,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZzBXMGxDeHg2UWZ5S0sxT184S045S29RZnlqY0RURkpTcDEyY09pVkxLQmlpbl9UMGJRSk9pNEdSUHY5LWtQWUEwa1p1T3VvWkNmcTJRcjB2YVNNdFktV2ZLSWJaaHBOYWd4RENDUFBzdlE9

theres a lot of great answers here and i know im late but id like to make an effort to gel everything together into a coherent overview an understanding of not just whats happening but what the effects are the operational strategic effects of this tactical phenomenon everyone being crazy dispersed into tiny formations the first most important thing to understand is lanchesters square law its the observation<url> that the power of a fighting force tends to rise with the square of its size so a force thats twice as large is actually <number> times as strong not <number> times as youd first expect the simple intuitive explanation for this is that if you have twice as many men you have twice as many hitpoints for your formation and twice as much firepower so youre actually <number> times as strong so if a force of <number> troops fight a force of <number> the <number> troops will not lose <number> men theyll actually lose something like <number> roughly a quarter of the losses youd first expect because they have twice as much firepower and twice as many men to spread the damage out over to make it less concentrated lethal so they take a quarter of the losses and get a <number><number> advantage over the enemy in terms of men lost they need to replace thats a really powerful advantage of course things like differences in technology tactics leadership weaponry etc can overcome this gap and let the smaller force beat the bigger one the famously coveted force multiplier but when <number> forces have broadly the same everything same exsoviet technology same exsoviet tactical manuals same exsoviet officer corps same exsoviet weaponry then theres not a lot of room to find an advantage over someone whos almost a clone of yourself the second most important thing to understand is that area of effectaoe weapons are really powerful and can kill these large formations stone dead if i take my <number> men against an artillery bombardment rather than an opposing force of <number> men and say were on the assault in the open so the artillery bombardment is super effective and practically everyone dies or gets wounded then my <number> men are not a superweapon they are just a supertarget no matter how many or how few men i send into the artillery bombardment blender everyone dies whether that be <number> men <number> <number> <number> or <number> so theres an opposing pressure to ignore lanchesters square law and make my formation as small as possible disperse as much as possible this is the famed empty battlefield phenomenon youre observing the third thing to remember is that there are some things you can only deal with through numbers if i say need <number> men to clear a single path through a minefield i need <number> men i cannot send a force of <number> men and expect them to do it i cannot send a force of <number> men either not if the enemy is shooting back and they need to defend themselves i can try sending a force of <number> men but its a bit dicey in the first place to rely on only a single path through the minefield maybe i should try clearing <number> paths instead to have some redundancy so now i need like <number> men for this operation <number> to clear the minefield <number> to guard them plus guard the path through so it doesnt close that <number> has to be subtracted from anything i do going forwards eg if i have a force of <number> men i can have the <number> conduct a breaching operation through the minefield just to send <number> guy through but if i have a force of <number> men i can have <number> conduct the breaching operation send <number> through and if i send in <number> men i waste only <number> of my force on the breaching operation can send <number> troops through but if i send <number> men the breaching operation will fail so there are some things that absolutely demand numbers more is more efficient less just wont work the fourth thing to remember is that bigger forces are easier to spot the fifth thing to remember is that the deeper you go into enemy territory the easier it is to be spotted the sixth thing to remember is that the deeper you go into enemy territory the easier it is for the enemy to have laid down really thick minefields stuff away from the reach of your artillery drones glide bombs stuff its hard to lay even barbed wire on the frontline as kofman points out according to useveretea<number><url> because youre constantly being watched shot at even at night but farther away from the frontlines the easier it is to dig some really good fortifications all these things combine together into a picture of stagnation <number> i cannot send a large force because they instantly die to a first approximation if they do somehow survive the more successful they are the deeper they plunge into enemy territory the more likely they are to get spotted get targetted by an artillery bombardment and instantly die or get critically wounded deep in enemy territory <number> i can send a small force but theyll struggle to accomplish anything the small force is stealthier surprisingly often gets ignored by enemy artillery as a waste of shells its admittedly a morbid strategy to make your mens lives cheaper more expendable than the enemys artillery shells but it works however once they slip through the enemy frontlines they cannot do much of anything they cannot outfight the large enemy forces surrounding them on literally all sides because of lanchesters square law they cannot try to slip deeper into enemy territory to try to hit lone targets like enemy officers or something because they dont have the numbers to cut through barbed wire breach through minefields they can call in artillery fire but the frontline enemy forces are deliberately so dispersed its a waste to shell them just like your own frontline troops and the backline enemy forces have had time space to dig in protect themselves against shells they can also trench raid the enemy frontline trying to beat small numbers with small numbers but that just results in combat thats extremely slow because a even if the engagement wipes out the enemy trench thats like a full days worth of battle to cause like <number> enemy casualties small numbers vs small numbers = small numbers dying and b when the enemy just trench raids back they recapture their trench so we dont make much progress in taking ground either my tiny forces are just extremely extremely slow at both winning the attrition warcausing casualties and winning the maneuver wartaking holding

continued <number> the same is true for my opponent neither of us can do much of anything so stagnation ie its an attritional war but its not even a fast one it could have been a fast bloodbath where its a matter of who can take the most losses but its over in weeks rather than a slow bloodbath where its a matter of who can take the most losses but its going to take years but it isnt because both sides can only send forth a tiny of their forces at once and so only a tiny can die each day its going to take a lot of days to churn through the entire <number> especially since they keep healing back up by calling up more troops + healing wounded troops up enough to get them back in the fight they might have to churn through something more like <number> of the enemys original health when only something like <number> are being wounded or killed per day and because of the wounded eventually reentering the fight only something like <number> actually get killed or knocked out permanently per day i dont actually know the exact numbers but you get the gist this is a dripfeed war <number> what fundamentally can anyone do about this how do we break the deadlock a la ww and get back to fast maneuver instead of attritionlandbased instead of casualtybased warfare the most fundamental problem is that you cannot mass your forces on the frontlines if you could a huge of your force could fight at once and the war would go faster and they could also start breaching through things like minefields barbed wire so you could start threatening the enemy by getting behind them rather than grinding them down from the front since we cannot we cannot have fast nor maneuverbased warfare so what we need to do is to find a way to be able to amass forces on the frontlines without them dying nearinstantly that means breaking the lock enemy artillery has on your frontline forces theres an entire kill chain you could target anything from the various enemy recon teams drones men satellites civilian informants recon planes etc to the communication infrastructure relaying their targeting data to the artillery radio cell phone starlink telephone fiber optic etc to the command control systems deciding which targets to shoot vs pass on officers to kill computers to hack and so on to the artillery systems themselves just blow them up to the logistics systems keeping the artillery supplied with shells to fire artillery is an absolute supply hog that might actually be its biggest weakness that was one of the things air power was good for in ww <number> i understand shooting down enemy recon blimps planes + waging air interdiction<url> against those juicy backline targets or you could try to make your forces more resistant to artillery instead thats one of the benefits of the invention of the tank in ww its armor makes it more resistant to artillery shrapnel not immune but better at surviving it and armor also allows it to ignore bullets just run forwards through no mans land meaning it can dodge artillery bombardments by blitzing forward simply not being there when the shells land so is there any analogue we could deploy right now some way to break the artillery killchain or just shrug off bombardments honestly i dont know im just a civilian if i actually knew the answer id probably be employed at darpa and also not be allowed to tell you it all i can tell you is what history shows what comes next is a much harder question one i dont have the time to answer even writing just this took an absolutely huge amount of time im hard pressed to spare itll be fun to look back on this in a few years though and see how right vs wrong i was though about the answer to the deadlock maybe this will all just be resolved through ukranian special forces teams assaulting the kremlin or something and the artillery deadlock will be completely irrelevant to how the war ends wouldnt be the weirdest thing thats happened in history edit tldr artillery its a slow grinding killer if your enemy just dripfeeds in their forces and its a mostly static weapon as well and if the slow grindy mostly static weapon is the strongest thing on the battlefield then the war is also going to be slow grindy and mostly static,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbVVCTE1hUWxlV3FBWUd5RDJianFEa1BXcFFXbXlRd3pQZG95MHhyYTh3WnFIdGRmaWowa2pJQzFzQmxzRGRIVkxjb0wtYS1ONXBVQU8yc2liVk9tX25aUVk3WmJ0ZDRmQm5VbElFOG9aanc9

the us uses it all the time if you consider missiles if we are speaking strictly gunfire then naval guns are very useful depending on conditions for example to continue with the us as an example when us marines were deployed to coastal zones to conduct operations such as noncombatant evacuations in liberia or peacekeeping in lebanon naval gunfire was a costeffective and responsive way to give the shore units fire support without putting big guns on the ground i believe naval gunfire was used by the us navy and marines in lebanon as has been mentioned by others the difficulty of traditional naval gunfire is getting it close enough to shore in the modern hostile environment where the shore will be defended by long range missiles aircraft and other ships but i would say in operations other than fullscale war traditional naval gunfire is still quite useful,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZY0g2NmZWU0FzNm9hZjhXOHM0eWdQbTNBcUlLcks5RTlzU2dRMUZsTTFUdE9yUVpxS2QtNXVKNzBYT3ZfVmNsQzgyNW1TNkpubG1zZWw1eC1VSHA5V1E9PQ==

the main sources for weapons during the early years of the war apart from traditional hunting weaponry were the french the japanese and the ossnationalist chinese french equipment largely came from the indochinese soldiery whether by defection or capturedeath of the original owner though some was also gained from the japanese after these disarmed and interned the french garrison of indochina although japan surrendered in august <number> the japanese army was left in place to maintain order until things could be sorted out during which time many japanese troops either gave their weaponry to the fledgling vm army or let them take it in some cases japanese officers and men not only gave their weaponry to the local vm but also provided training in the use and maintenance of said equipment the motivation here seems to be a general japanese antipathy to the return of western hegemony to asia american material via oss or nationalist china was probably a less important source but still welcomed by the early rebels with the mass surrender of many indochinese garrisons including that of the palace of representatives in hanoi who yielded <number> carbines and a large supply of grenades together with the donation of equipment by the retreating japanese forces including a windfall for the vm when a stock of weaponry much originally intended for china but which had been held at haiphong by the french in <number> was handed over by the japanese this included numbers of aa guns at guns and russian <number>mm rifles with at rounds by the end of <number> estimates of weaponry in vm hands included <number> smallarms rifles smgs carbines pistols etc <number> lmgs <number> mortars <number> artillery pieces of various types weapons were then supplemented through looting french arsenals or selfproduction in rudimentary weapons factories although surprisingly it includes some very formidable weapons like bazookas and antiblockhouse recoilless guns meanwhile military aid from china only began in <number> and in <number> with the soviet union,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZTY5NHZNZDhRUkhGSk1MYS15ZWtvV01OeUMwVlEwQkRmc1h1SXdOeHEwdHpkUm13dnM0ZkMtalJhNmRVM1lCUnQ2c2dBSmg0Q1ZFSjFyQnhxUVcyWkE9PQ==

simply put you dont in the time of total war a democracy is the last thing you need for how can you expect the dumb hungry foolish masses to see beyond their lives their struggles their hardships their morality for the grander picture how can you expect the squabbling politicians each only interested in themselves many were in league with outside forces to fight for their nation the famous example would be the roman there was a reason why the roman had the post dictator because they knew in time of crisis they could not let decisions be handled by the masses but by a clear and firm leader when the nd punic war happened only fabius maximus was levelheaded enough to realize scorchedearth tactic was the only way to stop hannibal but the stupid masses did not see it called him name elected two idiotic hotheads to replace him after his term was over gnaeus servilius geminus and marcus atilius regulus if these two names were familiar while yes these were the two idiots who led the roman to their worst defeat at cannae simply because the masses begged them too just look at france in ww and how they bungled the <number> invasion of france after that the right was more than happy to lick hitlers butt while the left refused to resist hitler because hitler was friend to the soviet union and it was only until stalin and hitler traded blow did they begin to resist oh and they also sold out their fellow french resistance members to the nazis<url> people often talked about how the us had a democracy during ww forgetting the fact that the us was the least damaged nation of world war <number> they also conveniently ignored the part that the fbi was given free reign to deal with domestic enemies the agency size went from <number> in <number> to a whopping <number> in <number><url> and the fbi was not the only spook in town there was the office of naval intelligence<url> who was also allowed to conduct personnel security inquiries sabotage espionage and countersubversion cases examine japanese activities in the united states and investigate war fraud matters did i mention the us government also hire the mafia to help them out<url> and established registry of german italian and japanese people and interning japanese and germans terribly undemocratic no and we are seeing the effect of having a free democracy right now in the ukraine war the russian had lost hundreds of thousands of men thousands of pieces of materials had all of their preliminary wartime aims denied and yet they are still pressing on meanwhile the americans have yet to lose a single soldier have only supplied ukraine with bare minimum weapons and training which was way way way less than what north vietnam received by the combloc in the vietnam war and yet the american public are wary of this war why because they have a free democracy where the loud masses have a chance to moan instead of seeing that this is the very best chance to knock down their traditional enemy for good with no cost to themselves and secure the us dominance as well as their childrens security they only see whispers of world war <number> whipped up by tiktok and twitter so no in a major war you dont maintain your democracy you make sure everyone shut up and united for the goal that was how the japanese proved so resilient how the vietnamese were abled to duke it out with the french and later the us ho chi minh put it best it may take ten of ours to kill one of yours may be one hundred of ours to kill one of yours but in the end you will lose and we will win seeing that we vietnamese won the wars i guessed you westerners should learn a thing or two from us,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbDdoWTZvMTVNM0J5QUNFWkdrdmtPY1g5aHVWbFNaY0pYMEI3dWlOekhLMHVBR0hZcXZyVlF2WmhGNHBPVnlvU2VPbHpKQjc5NVYxcUdDR1laOVhNa211cW5ZWWZVRllFUlI5elA4aXh6SUk9

ending a war is a broad statement but certainly stuff have made huge differences the radarbased vt proximity fuse was absolutely a huge deal in ww it represented a major technological boost and it allowed allied warships to have a significant boost in aaw and protecting both their own ships and the fast carrier task forces convoys etc before it was just fill the sky with bullets of several ascending sizes and hope that the sightthingies work and a plane runs into a bullet the vt allowed them much more likely a chance of actually kabooming a plane condensed milk was a crucial and critical part of the union army rationing and you might not thing of a foodstuff as a secret weapon but the confederates had much less ration resources than the union so they were almost always at a potentially severe disadvantage can only live so long on chicory coffee advances in both food preservation the unions ability to provision its forces and the souths almost total lack of said ability definitely a secret weapon you might make the argument that chobham armor was a secret weapon in the desert storm gulf war the brits like with vt knew they had something very special and the us got it but never deployed it on the m abrams mbt until then and it completely and totally romped on iraq we could kamboom them but they almost totally could not kaboom us that was pretty much what hitler always wanted a tank that was impervious to enemies but could destroy them at will if the secret of that is composite armor id certainly call that a secret weapon and might not have been an only factor for ending a war but thats a broad statement qualifier right there,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacjQ2V0FTYXVlWFdtQ0Y0LThWOW10Mk5DaTlmajRBZzZoVGFuZllVQ0xURi1uWGN6WjJXeThteVdrd3l4RW55UGxraWhHTWw0THVNelQyX2dXVzF4cnc9PQ==

i phrased that poorly my apologies my point is that it was in fact the per unit cost of the shells not the entire program cost being divided over those shells some fixed costs were being recouped of course but when they purchased ammo it was in fact that price its not the entire rd of the gun being divided over it or projected lifetime cost the way f<number> critics talk about things >the navy would have had to buy around <number> shells per ship to stock the magazines there were no other rounds available lrlap was the only round designed for the mm ags other <number> ammo wouldnt fit in the chamber right and the barrels were rifled differently than regular mm guns so while the army wouldnt necessarily want to order a lot of m rounds because it has other options the navy would want a lot of lrlap rounds because the alternative is a tomahawk this ignores the fact that there was initially the idea of a dumber round but that got dropped because of engineering issues and because the usmc want that for fire support but also wouldnt share budget particularly once the wars in afghanistan and iraq got going tomahawks arent the only other option either aviation is and for most cases is more than practical than a mm shell >so at <number> x <number> ships thats <number> shells at least id also assume that the navy would want to build up a strategic stockpile for their <number> ships so that they could replenish after a mission even just doubling it so that every ship can reload fully once is k shells the original requirements were for only <number> per ship a third of what youre assuming even if we are going with that full magazine youd still have slow production rates not sure where youre getting <number> from as declassified docs for ddg <number> showed <number> rounds per ship given the state of us shipbuilding it would be quite impressive if they produced a zumwalt every <number> months and built them all in <number> years but we will assume that so that we can get the most rounds per year going off that <number> per ship in the specifications to stock them all youd need <number> rounds per year minimum or a little over <number> per day even if we went to filling magazines immediately at launch youre talking <number> per day thats not mass production thats still quite the artisanal scale even if you want to assume things go up to <number> per day to account for use thats still small and room for economies of scale are limited its unlikely the ships would be built that fast or launch with full magazines either assuming k shells would have been purchased is beyond wishful thinking and even if purchased would have been over decades likely close to <number> years getting even to k per round was always going to be challenge even if they built far more rounds than the usn ever needed remember that the order of <number> ms was a per unit cost of k despite being a less capable round with less than a third which gets to the practical point it was more or less doomed from the start as the usn wasnt going to purchase and use that many rounds the payload of ~<number> kilos is pretty anemic compared to what the carrier wing can drop or a cruise missile like the tomahawk how many shore targets can a destroyer get within miles of safely is tolerant of the greater inaccuracy compared to a jdam or tomahawk and be destroyed by a warhead a fraction of the size for the realities the us faced from <number> onward the program was doomed budget priorities were always going to overtake it because fundamentally its just not that useful of a system and definitely isnt for its cost,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabHlRV1AxOTVSTno0Sk5vVG9xeDJWR0JQWHRTWHNjNjc1U3diV0RsaF9iSVdTZmVQbjYxcmc4Uk1QeTdWeFAwRXlDbEZUZXE0NWxIdG1vQ0VfeFd1a2JaOHJZYjNWV014QlRia25PVGQ0YjA9

nope camouflage and cover dont matter for effective istar especially counterbattery radar and counterbattery fire nor does lack of movement prevent istar thats why nato has moved and is still moving to shoot and scoot tactics using sphs because nato artillery used cover and concealment in the past as well movement ie rapid movement from staging areas into firing positions and back is key to survival moving a brigade undetected primarily involves coordination on a level which the afu cannot during last summers counteroffensive an afu brigade got lost because they took the wrong turn but its brigade artillery conducted the preparatory fire anyway,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUXZ1S3hhTWJXdG1hSnJmWUpYZE9oX2pTQTd3QkNfRmRsRWhEcHJZZlE3VkFLT0kzdEMybnNlWUh2QnJ1cC1sMElUYllZUFJnMzNXUllLRkVGOTd3ZEFKVFVrdk9aZVJvMk1vMTNQQ01NRDA9

protection laws have not really changed but the protections are not irrevocable if someone chooses to use a churchhospitalprotected cultural site as a military facility it becomes a legitimate target similarly if there is no other way to accomplish a military objective for instance if you built churches around the entity of a military base there would be no choice but to attack some of them to get through so the main thing that changes is whether both sides are obeying the geneva convention and other international laws if both are then churches should be neither used for military purposes or intentionally targeted once one side does not care it quickly becomes a situation where they have very limited protection also its important to note there is no real international enforcement agency to the laws of war if a major country decides not to follow them and no one else is ablewilling to enforce them then nothing really happens,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZzl1THctakRtc0tIbjJpaHYtZERuNkN2MW5pS3dpcDV6OW5TSGV4X3RxSzVBNGFHVDRwQ3ZtbTBCcDROTkhsMTFrOHdWcXUyQ1RoRkQwNU10eTlMS1E9PQ==

for all of that armies did march by foot and mostly by road but not always whenever they could usually because they were more efficient and harder to get lost in but also to help facilitate the movement of the baggage train which more often than not consisted of slow moving wagons and carts carrying provisions and other supplies unless youre relying solely on the pack animals themselves but you wont be able to bring as much along it really depends on the era and place of course but roads back then were typically far poorer than what we have now at least for walking even postmodern sidewalks if you have those in your locality are at least paved and are unlikely to turn to muck if it rains but not always im currently in nam for vacation and there are many old roads which are unattended to such that whenever it rains you see pools and quagmires of mud and these are harder asphalt roads mind you just not maintained whatsoever maintenance was likely far more difficult and sparse back then than today you see people refurbishing the roads quite a few times in the states at least however back then even in such a vast empire as that of the romans youd be unlikely to see nearly as much care and frequency taken to road maintenance unless an army needs to march through it which they sometimes repair along the way or even prepare a new road entirely if obstacles had fallen upon the road there were men specifically tasked to move in advance of the army spot them report of said obstacles and remove them if it was practicable before the army got there just so there are also scouts who range ahead to discover various roads settlements suitable camping sites enemy positions etc quite a lot of times especially in antiquity a general might even ride out to conduct a personal reconnaissance and ascertain the lay of the land note that crops are usually sewn closer to settlements and they are not the same sprawling fields as you would see in the postmodern era because there is a limit to what you can do without todays amenities and advanced technologies so the fields were likely smaller and were not present everywhere and the crop yields were even lower than nowadays which means that a field produced far less food for the people to eat even when the crops are ripe it is therefore common sense to encamp not too far from settlements where there were a goodly number of fields with which to draw forage from armies might even quarter themselves in multiple settlements or a single one if it can host their numbers however this might alienate the local populace and so there were generals who opted to encamp outside urban centers and in the hinterlands instead naturally soldiers are people and like close comforts but getting them used to the tough military life is part and parcel with being a good general you want to reward your soldiers for achieving their tasks and following your orders but not spoil them with the creature comforts available to the ordinary citizenry they will have to endure much hardship and toil there might never be those who grow fully accustomed to it but they would at best be made to suck it up on the matter of whether or not the locals will let you pass through in a lot of cases they did not have a choice but lets say that a particular polity or people will be troublesome to contend with if they turn hostile you can try to open negotiations with them and seek permission to pass through with promises that your troops will be on your best behavior ideally you would want to encamp outside the cities to prevent your soldiers from hassling the locals as aforementioned furthermore rather than just taking your forage by wanton looting you might opt to pay for it by means of money you brought in the baggage and this must be secured most tightly and entrusted to your most loyal men now foraging is not what most think it is true it does at times entail going into the wild and hunting or picking up foodstuffs available there but nature alone does not produce in abundance as much as the fields of man therefore a lot of times foraging as it were was a fancy term for farm raiding and pillaging taking from local grain depots and stealing from local homes what wheat grain and flour they have this may also include but is not limited to animals fit for slaughter which may be procured as meat soldiers might even be tasked to find draft animals to pull the wagons or carry supplies tools and various miscellaneous objects like boats might be taken and carted for transport across rivers or for the pontoon train which is for building floating bridges using rows of boats as their foundation if there are not good fords or sturdy bridges already present to cross a river naturally all of these may also be procured by purchasing it rather than stealing it furthermore if you are moving through the lands of a conquered people or vassal rather than taking your tribute in money you may take it in kind and other such necessities as i have mentioned above naturally the same may happen in your own lands to and there are those who commit just as much harm on their own people to suit their interests or what they consider the interests of the state,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNllhdkFlWWpuOUVibVRIQVM5aGdZQXlza0RxOTdMeTd6elpRb0sxdWI2NEhNaDdPMzQ2TG9RSEg2WEJaUlNubkFJcmJha0M2TFBWc0JDdnZ5aUVjV1E9PQ==

in order prevent these burdens from affecting the locals many generals therefore relied upon slow moving wagons coming afar from their homelands in order to provide pit stops and resting stations for these supply convoys deals may be worked out with local settlements to quarter them if not tactical bases in the form of old encampments might be left behind and garrisoned in order to receive the convoys offering them some respite supplies may be stored in these bases for future usage and we call these magazines or supply depots contrary to popular belief napoleon for instance did not rely solely on forage but also on these established supply lines this way he could optimally provision his army without relying on either as a crutch if necessary he may cut himself from his own supply lines and bases in order to rely on forage instead lightening the burden of his army and allowing them to conduct swift marches in their operations light carts or just the pack animals themselves may still follow up as part of a more mobile baggage train back on the matter of roads most have the misconception that it was not until the corps system that armies moved divided but this is not true we know that various powers did it in medieval times but also in antiquity based on some sources if the roads were available there were certainly advantages in doing so as moving along separate roads prevents mass traffic from holding up the rear columns which may be strung out on the march and more endangered by ambuscades by separating the marching paths one also opens new avenues for supply convoys to travel through such that if any were to be cut off and harassed by the enemy then one column of the army may rely on the neighbouring columns moving by other roads for victual and they may share their provisions when needed rather than putting all their eggs in one basket along a single route furthermore by diversifying the routes forage becomes easier on the army and the local populace as rather than relying only on the towns along a single road to provision the entire army the individual columns may take supplies from various neighbourhoods on multiple separate roads reducing the burden of any one locality this also makes it harder for the enemy to conduct scorched earth for they will have to do more harm to their peoples to deny the attacker provisions by scourging a greater number of areas we may often be surprised to know how their coordinated these various moving columns using just horseback messengers but there were also other methods available for communication signals fires for instance could be lighted and may serve to relay information about the whereabouts of one column relative to the other or call upon an ally for aid the french in napoleons time had a sort of rudimentary telegraph system where they used code instead of spoken word in order to relay information the operations which some generals conducted may even be several hundred miles wide in terms of the localities which these columns may traverse through and this was done even prior to the postmodern era or the invention of the telegraph as we know it of course one must always be careful to conduct thorough reconnaissance to make sure that the enemy cannot fall in these detachments separately and defeat them in detail aside from provisioning the men in terms of foodstuffs and attending to the movement of those supplies generals must also take procuring drinking water into account saltwater is absolutely a no go and only freshwater can be utilized to quench the thirst of the troops thankfully most settlements and crop fields are nearby bodies of water of some sort whether they be streams rivers ponds lakes springs or wells now more still bodies of water such as ponds small lakes springs and wells may be poisoned in order to deny water sources to an opposing party but it is much more difficult to do so to bodies of running water which gradually filter out waste such as a stream or river you will require a mass amount of pollution to dirty them and make them hazardous to drink should the waters be properly boiled of course armies can be massive at times and often produce a great quantity of human and animal excrement these have to be disposed of somewhere and latrines were often dug with canals channeling the waste into nearby flowing bodies of water if not dug in landfills in that case it might be better to encamp upriver of an enemy so that ones own waste flows downriver towards their camp and pollutes their sources of drinking and bathing water furthermore one can induce dysentery upon the opposition by flooding their camp which will wash out what waste they have amassed on land into the abodes of their soldiers infecting them with disease if not spoiling their dry foodstuffs which are not well stored water sources may also be dammed or diverted in order to prevent the enemy from receiving them conversely if one seeks to obtain water and there is no visible body to be found they may have recourse to dig for springs and create wells of their own,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOE1Bd3otRk9ZTE02LXhuSUFwTm94d1pLSUc4Y3hpd2djUzFBS1Rfajl6NTNjcFAtLXhJZWJETG9NS1pibl9sNmgzZHNUZ1dWNTJIV1JZU2hGOGV4Rnc9PQ==

when traversing bodies of water there are numerous methods first is to find suitable fords shallow enough to cross over with the army second is to procure boats to row the army across third is to establish a pontoon bridge made up of boats chained together in a row to the other bank facilitating ones crossing fourth is a method given by alexandros where tents of hide are filled with hay and then sewn shut whereupon they may be utilized as floating platforms or makeshift rafts to transport the men the fifth method which caesar used was to dig canals into the side of the river to channel and reduce its water level when it is deemed practicable to cross the cavalry should be sent in first and line up parallel to one another to act as makeshift guardrails in this manner the infantry and baggage may cross in between while the horsemen screened them from the flowing waters on one side and acted as lifeguards to catch any who slipped and fell on the other in choosing encampments it is good to look for places with natural high ground and eminences like a hill or ridge perhaps surrounded by rivers running through its front or flanks forests should be close by with which to procure firewood and for construction purposes but should not be so near the camp as to be a staging point for ambuscades therefore woodlands should be cleared away for up to several hundred yards the same applies for swamps and marshlands which may serve to screen the camp and inhibit the enemys advance but must not be too close as to induce disease from swarming insects or to act as zones where the enemy might have recourse to hide ambush detachments in of course not every camp site will be perfect or have these features available so one must make due with what they get if encamping within narrow forest defiles they should ideally clear the surrounding woodlands in the manner stated above felled branches might be used for stakes defending the camp perimeter while fallen logs can serve as abatis and it is not a bad idea whatsoever to entrench the camp establish an earthen and wooden rampart and construct palisades with which to defend it if in a mountainous defile then especial care should be taken to the rear of the camp where ambuscades are likely but also the flanks where hidden routes and caverns may host the enemy who often await to fall on a moving column or resting camp when one least suspects it if the ground is suitable and there are no nearby visible bodies of water mountainous terrain may have hidden reservoirs of water underground and digging for wells more be worth the while and keep the men busy in a swamp the troops must make do with what dry patches of land are available and endure if they can they may mount animals to rest on them and as grim as it is even the bodies of the dead may serve as dry platforms to find respite on these hardships hannibal and his men endured in their crossing of the arno river marshlands one cannot clear and drain a swamp as easily as a regular woodland so especial care must be taken not to let the army rest on its laurels entirely but remain vigilance deserts are not ideal to encamp upon the risks are far too great for scarcity of water but also the threat of sandstorms it is better to follow the course of rivers and settlements when traversing such arid landscapes and keep as far away from the dunes as possible if one must travel through those areas then they best pack light provisions and utilize them for swift manoeuvres only they must also be knowledgeable of local springs and oases with which to temporarily encamp if possible,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXA4aE1JclA2NEt4NXozSXE0c0x5THRzYW9ZRmdrOWczOE5mS19qS19SOFJ6U3A4a0NaOVI3aXk4ZFV2aTkwc05nV1VuQjhkM3dKTVBZb2cxNW1sY1E9PQ==

in regards to preventing desertion this is why flank guards and rearguards are set with more trusted men tasked with handling their defense on the march and to screen against enemy ambuscades however it is also useful in catching individual deserters whose presence will not be easy to miss with the eyes of hundreds unless a general is particularly despised and his men willfully ignore such things just so watches in the camp serve similar purposes establishing trust and good rapport with the men is the best preventative measure for dealing with desertion a general should be stern but not too harsh he should not punish every little thing but ignore the minor offenses while he can and only single out those offensives which are of the most grave danger to the army and state harsh punishments should be avoided and it is better to use the carrot than the stick when dealing with men soldiers are our fellow humans and the great captains have shown us that it is better to deal with them humanely rather than as beasts of burden to be whipped just so it is better to be loved and respected than hated and feared when it is possible avoid punishing the whole for the crimes of the few but seek the gravest offenders and utilize them as a brutal example of what awaits the masses should they seek to subvert the supreme authority of the general as aforementioned though the crime should not be some petty or trifling matter but only for those of utmost importance before berating the men it is better to take into account the reasons for their dissatisfaction and if time is available open a discourse with them in an assembly address their problems and make promises to do your utmost in fulfilling them alas being a general requires some politicking skills so you might have to make faux promises or those which cannot be immediately fulfilled offer enticements to meritorious service the minimum is letting the soldiers know and feel that they are taken care of but rewards for good service should go beyond mere medals or titles they should ideally be things which the soldiers might have want of or need one cannot often go wrong with monetary benefits but there are other cases in which the general should be adapted towards handling which may be of more personal matters for the individual men for various examples when scipio found out that one of his men was routinely abandoning his post to go to town he went among the soldiers and first got an account of that individual whereupon he found out that aside from skirting his post he was mostly a brave man and distinguished in service he also came to discover that there was a woman who that soldier had fancied and that was why he routinely betook of himself to leave the army and meet up with her therefore scipio went to town and took the woman into the camp then called up that soldier to convene with him though the soldier suspected punishment he was instead presented with his secret lover that he may keep her by his side scipio said that through these measures he hoped to see whether the soldiers love was true or whether he had subverted his duties for some baser purpose therefore this served as both a means to keep the man close to his task while also acting as a test of his true loyalties and intentions when some men under pompeius had discovered some treasure hidden by the shores of carthage rumour spread that there were numerous treasures further underground which were buried away when the carthaginians were threatened by the romans in ages past the soldiers then went on a mad frenzy abandoning the camp and digging for the supposed treasures though they completely refused to follow orders pompeius did not punish them but went about joking and laughing at their expense when the lot failed to find anything at all he then pardoned them of punishment for their insubordination stating that their worthless toiling which bore no fruit was punishment enough when caesars veterans requested that they be decimated that every tenth man be executed for failing him in battle against pompeius he refused their requests for punishment instead despite their defeat he won them further to his favour by making them swear to avenge themselves and win further glory in victory rather than wallowing in their failures and asking for punishment,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZnRMdTlkOHhENklmT3BXSzBkRnJBWXllY3FEVDdZeGpGS05EMk1wU2Q1R1dPWTZncWprYzdxX3JqMnhET081aXJEVGN0Z1VUY3BGZVp6cHJ0M05aY0E9PQ==

there was a major debate about the authenticity of this event a few years ago in china and needless to say it was a shit show like every debate around every wartime bravado turned into part of the collective memory since the dawn of men it was as politicized as you can imagine with a very large amount of people on both sides already made up their mind long before inspecting any real evidence i think in the end some conclusions were agreed upon <number> the original wartime propaganda version of the event written just before the full escalation of second sinojapanese war depicting a small group of between <number> to <number> soldiers from the nd company st battalion th regiment securing the chains against a strong garrison including fortified machine gun positions was likely exaggerated to some degree there is not much to say about this the luding bridge famously dangerous as it was made from nothhing but wood plates on iron chains would be very difficult to take once the wooden structure was burnt down to take a foritified position against heavy machine guns while crossing a river on iron chains would be difficult for humans regardless of how brave the men were while this is not to cheapen the experience of the original narrators who experienced the battle in their own way for sure further explanations would be needed <number> the rather conspiratorial claim raised at the time that the garrison unit made up by the troops of the sichuan warlords made an agreement with the attackers was also found wanting while this seems to be a more plausible explanation the issue is that few evidence historical archaeological or biographical was there to support it at best we have a few ethnically chinese authors from other nations claiming to have interviewed some survivors from the era confirming a peaceful crossing at worst there was nothing but guessing there is not much to say about this either the so call intervewees have been giving vastlly different accounts and they were interviewed long after the event decades since while it is true that the ccp propaganda machine has every reason to be biased in trying to prove the existence of a battle one must note that these authors have every reason to be biased in trying to disprove it it is bad history practice to take the an alternative version of the story just because the original one was biased <number> since then the efforts seem to be directed to finding other theses explaining the successful breakthrough those trying to reconstruct the battle largely on the basis of the wartime depiction ie wooden structure burnt machine gun equiped garrison etc proposed alternative methods in crossing the bridge trying to figure out the best way to cross a river on chains while shooting guns seems misguided if you ask me when the enemy had machine guns those looking from the campaign perspective proposed a more lighly guarded bridge a battle still occured but according to this version it occured first after a series of confusing engagements around the river and then a long tiring rush to the bridge by both sides to take it first the great confusing of the command structure and failure to appreciate the strategic importance of the bridge in this case led to the breakthrough not unsimilar to the lose of maleme airfield in crete these authors are the ones writing on the kuomingtang sources or whatever there was left to them they still use the unreliable memory of surviving nationalist commanders who was far from the battlefield and had reasons to tell a more favourable story to the new regime but seems a step further than figuring out the best way to climb on a chian according to the s recounts the th regiment minus a battalion of the th infantry was assigned to defend the regions around the bridge the regiment was poorly equiped and actually lost contact with its brigade command vastly outgunned by the red forces in terms of fire support across the river the garrison was believed by these authors to fail to offer determined resistance and was already more than ready to retreat other arguments are around too some believe the wooden structure was not fully burnt and the bridge was still fit for walking at the time at least to a degree deceptions were known to be used by both sides to trick the other into misidentifiying the units others believe in even more outthere batshit insane ideas ultimately i dont think it matters that much people clinging onto constrcuted collective memories are not here to argue in good faith neither are those obsessively rejecting the recount of an event just because it was the mainstream version those defending the bridge are long dead as are those attacking it we are still here the living matter more than some long gone bloodshed and if should war comes and our cause be just we will have our own reasons to be brave the past is the past and interesting mostly to the historic inquiry but you know modern world cant

you cant really armor fuel tanks it takes a lot of steel to reject a <number> lb bomb <number>+ inches of armor grade steel which is extremely impractical rather than armor them you build many of them and spread them out so that a hit to any one tank doesnt spread to all of the rest so that it takes lots of bombs to knock out all of the tanks which reduces their individual value as a target potentially to the point where if you cant deliver enough bombs to destroy all of them its better to drop those bombs on other targets instead and while the tanks may not have exploded from just any damage fire would have been just as bad and avgas is pretty flammable though somewhat less explosive than straight gasoline they were as well protected as everything else on pearl harbor that is to say their protection was contingent upon an alert and ready force of defenders rising to meet any attacker in the air well short of the tank farms with aircraft while ground based aaa shot down anything that made it through that failure to be prepared is the main failure on dec th and the reason the army and navy garrison commanders were both sacked otherwise they were isolated from each other such that a leak and fire at one would not spread to the others except with assistance in the form of bombs and bullets i dont know if any improvements to survivability were made to the existing tank farm during the war but even before pearl harbor there was a massive construction project underway to build a series of underground tanks away from the base itself it wasnt finished until <number>,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN3lzQWE5S2Vtc2pTUjBSc0dUaHlvSXphQzZFU2NrN3dqTlNuVk11YXBCXy1vU2N2Nk1wcnVrSlVHc2xVSF9Ec3ZwZXVxcWZoenlFcUthLWZreXhDQ1E9PQ==

fyi your question is about geodetic datums not just prime meridians and its an enormous can of worms however big you think this can of worms is its bigger than that most us states have their own datum some have several california has <number> so it isnt just nato also precisely nobody uses the prime meridian that runs through the greenwich observatory anymore there are a few reasons for why there are so many geodetic datums first of all weve been making maps and defining datums far longer than weve been able to measure the earth accurately as new technology develops and we refine older techniques we can define more accurate datums and we find out that we can make a better one so we do but we still have old maps that use the old datums second theres a difference between a global and a local datum if we want to make a datum that works for the entire world and a datum that works well for a small area those are actually different goals and for both of them we have to make tradeoffs it turns out that its impossible to achieve both of them perfectly so if we want something thats the best but we only need it to work for one country it will not line up with the rest of the world alsopeople dont want to have to redraw every single map so the old datums tend to stick around for a while even if in the us some state and local governments use maps based on nad <number> north american datum of <number> instead of the current wgs <number> world geodetic system of <number> which is what the federal government and most states use you could get a better answer on rgis,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTVGQ3NHdzg5LU5sUGljQkpteHo0R3ZwVWFGeHdtU0Q5NkRYOEhqNHBPVlNINDlkV19WTE5rTGdjU3Z3TGl6VUZuRlduTm9zdlEwQlpPT3ZIUGdaNXc9PQ==

red hill was ultimately the protection option in the long run with that said one of their key defenses was the difficulty of actually destroying the complex as pointed out in other posts the fuel on hand was bunker fuel which isnt very volatile it can be ignited but it tends to smolder vs explode this kind of touches on why the fuel tank farms werent quite the targets that alternate history likes to make them to be one of the reasons the fleet was the target vs the support facilities is as the loss of most of the usns battleship fleet demonstrates it took fairly few warheads on target to destroy a ship and a ship is very complex piece of machinery that might take years to produce getting them while theyre unready and easily destroyed thats pretty winwin you werent going to get that <number><number> good hits=dead target payoffs from the fuel farm or a lot of the support facilities they needed significantly larger warheads and likely more bombs than the ijn could credibly put on target just in terms of platforms theres a finite number of planes and only the bns could realistically carry the larger bombs needed for some of these targets as a result the first wave and second wave focused on the high payoff targets that would with just a few good hits greatly impact the usns ability to do much of anything a third wave might have been able to degrade or disrupt pearl harbor as a naval base but defenses over pearl harbor were very active for the second wave and the third wave would likely be a lot less successful any notdestroyed interceptor was in the air all guns manned and the japanese were racing against some time considerations the japanese were cutting it very close on fuel and the realization the usns carriers were not in pearl harbor but out there somewhere had some impact on the ijn leaving having won a stunning victory but not pushed their luck,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUUEwR2lYV3hzODQzUHZsZWJYY2dkSU9KYkNxZnVsQldFLV91UzJNaVlHY1hTcjV3STJ2dnNQdkhDbVVOUE1Gd1pOMzlXbTVWZ0d6QWVmMEQyVXl3LTlsMjg0WlU0WVBkalJaaWZoUTZrX2M9

we own the night a common phrase within the us military in particular which i think is to denote the level of technical superiority over our adversaries with particular reference to the ability to fight at night now that were aware how limited russias capabilities are at fighting at night its probably not second guessing ourselves but i wonder if hypothetically russia was as big bad and scary as they had hoped how would the west be able to counter a peer opponent that can meet them on the same level with regards to the ir spectrum specifically ive kind of stumbled upon randomly as you and many others here i imagine do an article read wikipedia page about the sniper targeting pod on us aircraft which is designed to pick up friendly ir strobes for iff purposes on the ground but how would this play out if the adversary was at a peer or even near peer level are there means to counter enemy nightvision devices from picking up friendly emitting signals or vice versa,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMkpaSmdvU1JRU1R6bjJFckpEQmRIVkcxQVdnaFpMejJnYVRQblR4R2U1MENhT0V1NFhCQXhteExvNGJjY2U4NFBQUlJzUmphSmVtMUxHd0xWR3o4bUE9PQ==

thanks i appreciate it as for where to start hmm after thinking about it for a bit the best i can come up with right now is to take maths classes in university or otherwise study maths a la brian reynolds advice in this interview <url><url> >oh and if you had to give anyone some advice on becoming a designer >people come up to me and say i want to be a game designer what courses should i take >brian smiles >how about probability and statistics and thats not what theyre thinking to me the key thing about being a game designer is being able to look at a curve and imagine the curve you want something to have and knowing what equation will create that curve i want costs to go up like this or like that and being able to map these things onto other things to do probability knowing if i do random numbers itll come out differently you need to be able to internalise that its a key thing sorry i cant give a better answer if you want to focus on lanchesters square law specifically theres this video by the youtuber spirit of the law on its effects in age of empires <number>aoe<url> but if you want to focus on the more general idea of mathematical modeling for game design and what parts of math most commonly show up in games even if the designer doesnt realize it i cant think of any good resources off the top of my head beyond just generally knowing a bunch of math if you want you can read some of my other posts about specific mathematics things that show up in videogames like information entropy<url> the cause of much lag because it tends towards a maximum just like regular entropy in fact it is exactly the same as regular physical entropy and this amongst other applications is the solution to maxwells demon<url> hyperbolic growth<url> why x games tend to snowball in favor of the leading player even more than regular exponential growth would suggest and span of control<url> not exactly a mathematical concept such as a human factor design concept but extremely relevant to the mathematics of game design since its easy to design a x game or whatever that grows beyond the players comfortable span of control since growing your empire is what the genre is about and the number of clicks necessary to control your empire tends to grow linearly with its size you can think of this in terms of big o notation<url> if you want on rather than oconstant or olog n look at clickeridleprogression games as a counterexample of how to make it so that pregrowth you click a lot but postgrowth you actually click less the exact opposite of the typical progression in a x game or look at spreadsheet games like imperialism imperialism <number><url> warning long podcast link where growing your empire just means typing in a bigger number to a single unit rather than having more units to control or automation genre games like factorio as an example of how to grow by an absolutely insane amount while keeping the demands on the player reasonable through sucessive layers of gameplay automation first you automate mining then you automate crafting then you automate transport then you automate building then you recursively automate building until all you have to do to play the game is click where you want to build stuff theres also the option of just taking things away from the players control entirely like that upcoming rts battle aces where instead of building worker units replacing them when they get killed they just automatically build themselves rebuild themselves on a timer so you dont have to even remember to click anything if you want i can keep talking eg lanchesters square law is essential to understanding why wall of force is a busted good combat spell in dd in every edition it shows up in dividing an encounter in half = <number> encounters of onequarter difficulty because of lanchesters square law = halfdifficulty encounter very few other spells allow you to halve an encounter with just one casting or why starcraft <number> often comes down to a single clash between deathballs<url> that decides an entire match in just moments<url> or why civilization <number> deliberately made it so that artillery units didnt act like artillery units instead suicided into melee combat with the enemy because a deathball of artillery is like a deathball of regular units but even stronger instead of killing enemy units with few losses in return because your superior numbers can cut them down in an instant as they fire at you you get to kill enemy units with no losses in return because you get to cut the enemy down in an instant before they fire at you you see this with artillery deathballs in civ <number> grits artillery deathball in advance wars <number> <number> and prism tank deathballs in red alert <number> amongst other things each every time once you amass a sufficient artillery deathball you can simply march forwards conquer the map without stopping to heal replace units or otherwise slow down or be slowed down in any way since nothing can even touch you quite literally they cant get close

it had to do with the nature of mongol society the mongols were nomadic pastoralists an economic model that was not labor intensive other societies practiced sedentary agriculture which was extremely labor intensive in very simple terms the mongols and other steppe nomads were able to dedicate a higher percentage of their male population to war because they didnt require as many men to be engaged in food producing activities as sedentary agricultural societies it takes relatively few men to mind a herd but it takes a lot of dedicated labor to work the fields additionally herds could be marched alongside the army and to a certain extent the primary difference between the steppe nomads at war and steppe nomads at peace was really just the presence of women and children additionally the nature of nomadic society meant that the basic activities of everyday life were very close to those of an army at war riding shooting hunting making camp working as a group and making and maintaining all your own kit are all activities that prepare a man very well for military service by contrast tilling fields harvesting maintaining livestock and the myriad other activities that are required in sedentary agriculture are not activities that make a man a better soldier that said sedentary agriculture does produce a lot more food for the same amount of effort which allowed sedentary societies to develop much greater levels of specialization they could produce more and better weapons and armor as well as support permanent military personnel more can be said but i hope that gives you some idea,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMzRkWVc0NVBXbnh3aW5yRlhURjFrcE5yYjhPNDlXRU5BbDVhTlY5RGF0S09WaXk2alJoMElJTk1fLXdxZzZERVEwSzhjOFA5N0UyTHBUR3Zwa3UzRFE9PQ==
both you maximize throughput if the aircraft flies individually the spacing is determined by operational factors basically keep in mind that there are bottlenecks at each end not just runways but also cargo facilities refueling etc it would be more efficient to receive one aircraft every x minutes than getting a bunch of aircraft all at once optimizing the spacing and related procedures such as what to do if an aircraft misses its approach or has a mechanical problem was a major preoccupation during the berlin airlift of course if you are expecting to be attacked then you might use formations also if its okay for all the cargo to arrive at once you might use formations this is the case in a paradrop situation you want to saturate the drop zone note that maritime convoys are inefficient for similar reasons you have to load all the ships before departing this means the ships that got loaded first have to wait around for days or even weeks then the ships arrive at their destination and swamp its unloading facilities basically by convoying you sacrifice maximum efficiency of your merchant tonnage and cargo facilities to provide safer voyages that is part of why during the world wars there was such reluctance to adopt convoys do we really have to go through all this hassle,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWFFsd01oMWQ0c0tHWDNEM3luTXZOVjk0eWRvM0otM0JhNll3U25CZl9ibW5iY2dfTUNnZWQ3cFk0cFdNeTNqbUxSX1FYTFFxY2dITmU0TlBEVjBxRlE9PQ==
as you said agricultural societies created surplus which could be soldexchanged for goods and labor which led to specialization and in many cases advancements that made them militarily superior the downside was it created a large group of men who could live their entire lives without learning martial skills the people they paid to be the military may have been more advanced than a pastoral society on a certain level but there werent as many of them compared to the total population and the nature of a settled society also created vulnerabilities that pastoral societies could exploit the proliferation of gunpowder weapons was a huge leg up for agricultural societies in that regard because it allowed for rapid training of soldiers who otherwise might not have innate martial training as has often been noted an english longbowmen not to mention a knight or man at arms takes a lifetime to train whereas you can train a man to fire a musket in a few hours and to be a soldier in a few weeks agricultural societies became the dominant form of society globally over time but there was still a trade off and sometimes those societies when they came into contact with more pastoral ones paid a heavy price for it particularly before firearms but for the most part those were just the edge cases,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVmVhV21YYndrN0I2cEItVU9IcVoxY3N6Mk1aSHVjcExYREFpZURnOVI4Qk1Ea3dfWi01a3IzYVR6SHRIYWpDWmpsbWhhVG9PQ1A5enRZOGQ4NE1Tbnc9PQ==
a shipping convoy enables you to concentrate vulnerable targets thus enabling assets to protect them more easily than if they were scattered thats the gain of a convoy of any kind the trade off is a drop in efficiency since you have to wait for the ships to all get together all have to be loaded before they can go they all have to sail at the speed of the slowest ship etc and you have to put more work into organising it in the berlin airlift the planes werent being shot at and therefore did not need to be grouped for ease of protection grouping them would have required them to do massive formations in orbit above whichever airbase they flew from like was done with bombers in ww but for absolutely no gain if you look at what they did in berlin like the block system that sent a plane every four minutes at increasing altitudes a convoy breaks the efficiency of that in the hump very few of the flights were intercepted some were but not the majority protection by other assets was largely out of the question given the route though that changed later in the war the major threat was mechanical or weather problems or terrain issues which flying in large formation does not solve and given the extreme ranges they were operating at forming up just makes it more likely they run out of fuel before they reach their destination and introduces difficulties in landing when you see transport aircraft grouped together its because theyre either flying into contested airspace that requires protection or theyre carrying stuff that needs to be kept close together on landing so paratroopers tend to be dropped by congregated aircraft the rest of the time you lose efficiency for no gain,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRF9LUzQzeVQxOUt3VTdGXzdhclA1d3pZdGNKS1o3OWRGWHB6aGlHVGZtNFR5MkNPRXhqby1ia3dBLXZmM1d0TVBxY0JfMHBLWEE4ZkI2TnBuREZKeEE9PQ==

the thing about the mongols their army werent that big despite what you may believe your typical image of a mongol horde is an entire ocean of men and horses moving across wide open plains showering so many arrows they blot out the sun in reality they werent that big on one hand you must consider that historians lie for a variety of reason it wasnt uncommon for the defeated to inflate the attackers numbers to excuse their defeat for example when the vietnamese troops were slaughtered at binh le nguyen vietnamese history tried to claim there were some <number> mongols and <number> yunnan troops in reality the entire mongol force that destroyed vietnam during the first invasion probably numbered at most <number> as they were a secondary force but good luck trying to explain to people how <number> mongols maybe even as low as <number> destroyed a vietnamese army that could have been <number> strong and forced the tran dynasty to run for the jungles to makes matter worse maybe some rebellious noble would look at that and say if the mongol can do it with <number> men then what stops me from doing the same sometimes it wasnt because the historians were trying to excuse themselves the mongols were extremely mobile appearing in and out of nowhere like during their invasion of the khwarazmian empire one army could easily look like five and the mongols also used propaganda and inflated their numbers to scare the living daylight out of the defenders also mongolian army did not travel alone a tumen of ten thousands would also be accompanied by slaves support staffs craftsmen relatives etc so an army of fifty thousands may only have ten thousands fighting men on the other hand the ratio wasnt that high there were about <number> million mongols by the time of the invasion of china and most source had it that about a <number> of them joined the invasion or <number> of the total population later on their armies became bigger but so too was the population base as now they incorporated more people and with it more soldiers the later mongolian army wasnt mongol there was chinese siege engineers arab medicine men korean sailors italian guides etc,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRW1rcURGbzdtNDNRQzFzLW5uZ0s2Ylp1LXl5bWZHMDZwYVRQQ0RWMXA0UzF2bG9XbkRGOFZzYU9LQ1M4bHpnaXA5RE1EbU1CdVllWndVVUFzTkNqTE1iSXdjb29kczJFTkFEMWh3TllhYUk9

it is perhaps arguable that the mongols like other steppe pastoral nomads were able to field formidable armed forces because their lifestyle their everyday survival depended on skills which amounted to military training the pastoral lifestyle meant that they had to manage and guard large herds of livestock to do this over large swaths of steppe their youngest were on horseback and learning archery skills as toddlers they learned methods for huntingscoutingpatrolling as we would learn our abcs as their herds of livestock and horses would quickly consume pasturage permanent housing was unsuitable so they lived in packable yurts or yurts mounted on carts heres herodotus describing why the scythians early steppe pastoralists were unconquerable book iv chapter <number> having neither cities nor forts and carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go accustomed moreover one and all of them to shoot from horseback and living not by husbandry but on their cattle their waggons the only houses that they possess how can they fail of being unconquerable and unassailable even the mongols like the scythians were something like naturalborn horse archers there was no need for individual training as recruits their lives were their training,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRW12N2Q5cG1iZWhJMzdDbDBpMTV2bGtLekc3UVEtWjRrcWJFbUlpaFF2ci1PVTJRbEJIZ1ZGUHFDSjh5Z0pKLU1sMjh5Tk1YMVkzZHdwcjcxcXNsSVE9PQ==

it is a very complex issue to compare directly from a monetary point of view due to a number of peculiar institutional circumstances under which soviet foreign trade was conducted these include the inconvertibility of the ruble and the inconvertibility of the currencies of other bloc nations with which the soviet union transacted the bulk of its trade on a strictly bilateralbalance basis additionally there was a highly manipulated internal price structure that differed markedly from that of any western nation it is also inadvisable to directly compare costs from different sources because they might use different criteria or different time spans this makes conversion not only difficult due to inflation but also further complicated by the economy of scale for example an afv just entering service will be much more expensive than a vehicle at the end of the production run for example this is the list by chobitok bmp<number> <number> rubles bmp<number> <number> rubles bmd<number> <number> rubles bmd<number> <number> rubles btr<number> <number> rubles btr<number> <number> rubles t<number> <number> rubles tam <number> rubles t<number> <number> rubles tm <number> rubles t<number> <number> rubles ta <number> rubles tb <number> rubles tb <number> rubles tbv <number> rubles ta <number> rubles tb <number> rubles t<number> <number> rubles tb <number> rubles tud <number> rubles however chobitok also provides elsewhere that the btr<number> cost around <number> rubles which was approximately <number> of the cost of a t<number> both pieces of information are correct but they cannot be directly compared due to differences in context and criteria generally a btr was half the price of a bmp which in turn cost around the same as older cheaper tanks but less than contemporary main battle tanks that included costly fire control systems occasionally multiple systems can be compared simultaneously providing a more accurate picture for example the regular ot<number> version with a <number>mm turret was priced at <number> czk while the radiocommand versions r<number> r<number> r<number> ranged between <number> and <number> million czk in comparison the t<number> cost approximately <number> million czk the ta and bmp<number> each cost <number> million czk and the k<number> amphibious tracked cargo carrier was priced at <number> czk in the late s,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRWlCVXByWXVubG4wOHBuMnM4VUNENWJjSDQ3QVlRc1hHbkhrR2R6VXotel9iU3hGdGF6VG1TQmpRanZPT1AwbFBUdHF1VjRYd1A1VmdQVVloc1Vrd2c9PQ==

as you wrote agriculture includes maintaining livestock before modern industrial farms this meant herding livestock cattle domestic water buffaloes sheep and goats they also had to keep away bears and wolves which were much more widespread than nowadays we have many folk stories about herders and wolves and about bears in forests if it takes relatively few men to mind a herd this sounds very similar to nomads for example from what i know when bulgars settled on the east balkans lower danubian plain they continued herding livestock alongside slavs and thracians and continued riding horses and shooting bows with arrows while mounted just like mongols,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTnNXZWZDRGktbkNLT1liX2x2UkYzSU1OVDV5OVMzVFdLQ0lGZ1FrcWthcDFHRVUzT0NvMFFUVWpKb2xQMkNBZTg1T3RYWHJTS01fOXhUcWJyZERHNGc9PQ==

nomadic societies can always convert large percentages of their men into soldiers theres no homes to look after no farms to tend or even defend and their herds which are at the core of their economy can be moved with them the huns the bedouin arabs the sanhaja berber confederation the various waves of turkic nomads and the great plains tribes of north america could maintain a similarly high ratio of warrior to civilian for many of the same reasons the downside of nomadism militarily is that while you may be able to convert a high percentage of your populace into fighters come wartime that population is in and of itself unlikely to be super high pastoralists and huntergatherers are less likely to produce surplus food than agriculturalists which makes expanding a population hard this is one of the reasons in fact why nomads often have to raid their settled neighbours for among other things food left to their own devices theyre often living a subsistence life and if something happens to the herds they depend on it can be a demographic disaster the typical way around the issues of population size is accordingly to ally with or absorb other groups into yourself the huns incorporated large numbers of goths alans sarmatians etc into their military the umayyad and abbasid caliphates recruited recently converted persians and berbers to bulk out their arab armies the almoravid sanhaja pulled troops from the zanata and masmuda berber confederations the north african arabs and black west africa the seljuks swallowed up other turkic tribes and conscripted persians and arabs as they rolled into the old abbasid territories the lakota comanche et al used abduction and adoption to make up their losses etc etc the mongols accomplished what they did because genghis khan and his immediate successors employed the above strategy extremely effectively genghis not only absorbed all of the mongol warbands into his own but did the same with the turkic tribes of central asia giving himself a far greater pool of manpower than hed have gotten out of mongolia alone theres a reason youll often hear the term turcomongolian and its because of the extent of intermingling that already existed between those groups something that genghis took full advantage of later claimants to the mongol imperial legacy like tamerlane and babur will be almost wholly turkic in ethnicity but will still view the world through a mongol cultural lens beyond the turks the mongols recruited from all the other peoples they encountered too arabs persians and han chinese as well as the many many minorities living under arab persian turkic or chinese rule all find their way into mongol armies when kublai khan conquers southern china he does it with an army that contains more northern chinese than it does ethnic mongols the mongol thrusts into the islamic world are supported by large numbers of turkic and persianate soldiers from the recently conquered central asian khwarazmian empire the mughal conquest of india was only possible because of all the indians that were hired to supplement the turcomongolian and afghani invaders indeed as a general trend youll see that where the mongols fail to expand theres typically a lack of local manpower to draw on the mongols in syria were at the end of their logistical rope and were up against mamluk egypt which controlled all the important military forces in the levant the early mongols could make devastating raids into india but couldnt occupy it because the delhi sultanate had a monopoly on the subcontinental mercenary pool the mughal invasions centuries later will succeed because thats no longer the case the mongols beat numerous southeast asian armies but couldnt recruit enough vietnamese chams khmers etc to make holding the region possible and so on and so forth wherever the recruitment drive ends thats usually where mongol expansion ends too,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQV9CWmdOSUcyU29KbHhOSjI4QWhTaDNzZmVkaDBUandUNWdPVHNjNnBJM0hLejZaMFVwMjJiaUtUOW1iaklxSWE0N2ZkTzZTX040dzA0YzU1YTBlMDZkMkNvR2hpc3pyaXRBOVNRdDZmd009

you hit a pretty sharp eastwest dividing line in europe where pastoralism was no longer viable the hungarian plain is pretty much the last major grassland in europe suitable for large herds west of that livestock was more scarce and the larger animals especially horses had to be fed grain to make up for the lack of pasturage a french or english village might have a meadow where the plow oxen were grazed and the pigs might be allowed to run around the villages little patch of woods but that didnt require a horse or any special skills the effort went to growing cereal crops which were extremely labor intensive put another way if youre on the steppe the limit to the number of horses you can have is your physical ability to herd them since you can always move to find new grass in western europe the limiting factor is the cost to feed them,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSUdiamktTEI1bE1GQ1Y4TFAta0JuN2FhQ2d0UlhBRDZMUGl6RW9xb040LVlBYlprZmFOM3BLMjFpTXU4VzEyOFpvZG5jdWxod2lJNEh3dFlIQTZNLWc9PQ==

the needs of agricultural labor are not just planting and harvesting there is an unending series of tasks that need doing in order to support an agrarian society every man you pull out of agricultural task is one less man producing food in the short term you can commit large portions of men to war but it wont take long before the economic implications of cutting your food producers catches up with you rome is much more the exception than the rule here rome had a massive agricultural capacity in part because it controlled high quality agricultural land and in part because it had a large slave population that carried out many agricultural tasks roman citizens represented a relatively small portion of the overall roman population and because of the reserves of labor rome could afford to heavily commit its citizen population to warfare when needed rome also had a relatively complex administrative system which allowed it to more effectively exploit its agricultural production leaving that aside the majority of a population in a sedentary agricultural society will be employed in agriculture full time while some agricultural societies could put large numbers of men in the field short term the overwhelming majority of the population wont have time or energy to dedicate to military skills additionally unlike in nomadic pastoralists society the daily life of an agricultural worked does not adequately prepare them for war however the economic surplus a sedentary agricultural society produces does allow a small segment of society to pursue military endeavors full time at a certain point in an agricultural society the question comes up what is a better use for these ten farmers do i really benefit from having <number> more untrained farmers on the battlefield or would they be better used at home growing more food so that i can put one more well equipped trained professional in the field in reality the math was very rarely that simple or direct but the basic idea was consistent an agricultural worked is much more useful to his society at home producing food than he is on the battlefield,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZG90RU1vdmlrQXJSVWR6Q0RkV1JfajJqUUQzcVgwU0w2Y0tLdnFPa2RNX0xobFUzUURQUWVRRi1RV2hyQUc0bzViaVZsZi1idjctck1yRkdrYzl4TEE9PQ==

the common answer is weight distribution but an equally important and less commonly given reason is speed a great comparative study is the pz <number> lynxluchs which is a fast light tank weighing <number> tons and also has interleaved road wheels another comparative study is the churchill tank which has small noninterleaved road wheels and is a very slow tank tank tracks dont evenly support a tank the road wheels support the tank even though the track is continuous if you have five road wheels then there are five points where most of the load of the tank is transferred to the ground if you had <number> smaller road wheels in the same space then youd have <number> points where the load is transferred to the ground the result is that the design with more road wheels has a much lower peak ground pressure than the design with fewer road wheels lower ground pressure has a number of effects most importantly improving tactical mobility so as you shrink road wheels you get better weight distribution but as you shrink road wheels you also have more of them and they quickly start to get small smaller road wheels are bad for obstacle crossing if youve ever ridden a bicycle with small versus large wheels the larger wheels ride smoother and also makes traversing bumps and curbs much easier this is especially important the faster you want to go see as a comparison the churchill tank it uses many small road wheels which were not a problem due to its low speed interleaving large road wheels is trying to get the best of both worlds by having more road wheels that are offset each other you get a low ground pressure and a more continuous contact with the ground by having large road wheels you retain the obstacle crossing capability of larger wheels the big drawback is that now maintenance and production becomes much more difficult see the pz <number> lynx as an example of a light tank with interleaved road wheels for the same reasons it could drive up to <number> kmhr and was a capable off road vehicle at the time those german tanks were designed speed and maneuverability was considered essential so the tradeoff in complexity was thought to be worth it its also the case that when those tanks were designed the german army was well supplied and the heavy tank doctrine called for those tanks to be breakthrough tanks for which a higher maintenance design was acceptable as the war ground on those heavy tanks were increasingly asked to perform as mobile medium tanks where their maintenance issues were a much bigger liability really the interleaved design wasnt unreasonable the design has become somewhat notorious for getting bogged down in the russian winter where mud would get between the road wheels and freeze there while that was a flaw its a pretty specific flaw to that specific time and place its not even the entire winter once the ground freezes solid its no longer a problem in any case later designs solved it by leaving more space between the interleaved wheels while the general maintenance issues would have still been present and noninterleaved seems to be the better design overall i really doubt wed be having discussions about interleaved wheels <number> years later if it wasnt for that mud,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcEpvN3h5VGtmRXV6MV9qbFdlSzlQZEVLLXhYODZURUZaNUN1QVRFaDdzYzdWbjNRcDVPNk96UEVucUVmNllyWGYyNTloWWZfUUxIejFwS1d5VDg5cEE9PQ==
>so i have concluded that there is a double standard in the war so far between noncombatant countries allowing their territory and infrastructure to support expeditionary operations so in case you havent noticed the entirety of kremlin posturing in the public space has been a massive double standard more accurately its as if the russian government took a list of all manipulation strategies known to man and wrote a giant todo list at the very top >so how is it that it is permissible from any countrys perspective that belarus cannot be attacked while providing infrastructural support to russian military but if nato countries were to do the same then russia threatens attacks in those countries its the great miracle of russian propaganda which has managed to achieve this bizzare situation where russia doing a is okiedokie while nato doing a is escalatory and bad russia strikes apartment buildings daily but nato allies dont allow ukraine to use their weapons for strikes within russia nato arming ukraine only prolongs the war but russia receiving arms from north korea and iran is fine and dandy on a related note russian threats about striking nato countries can in most cases be simply disregarded russia genuinely shits its pants at the thought of nato countries actually getting serious in supporting ukraine or worse for them actually getting their own militaries involved in the conflict which such a strike would most likely assure small arms himars modern tanks atacms and many more were supposed to be a red line that when crossed would result in a nuclear war and yet not a single nuke has fallen and every single time russia went from this will cause a nuclear war to this is actually not a problem for us russias best shot at winning this war is making sure nato doesnt get involved any more than it already is and attacking nato countries is probably the best way to achieve precisely the opposite effect all this russian posturing about attacking nato countries is merely a tool to scare the average person and through that hopefully pressure nato politicians from supporting ukraine which strangely and depressingly enough seems to be working,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhR0E2cjU3VjNMeWNSYWhwdHFoY0xhTEFPTF82ZmxkY1MtaG1QYmdZQXFFT0M0aWp6MnIxN096SHZ1VFlQdTJ0Yy1iaHgzeTFnSkl0OXB2MnRUYzh5ZXc9PQ==
this is a very insightful comment and i enjoyed reading and thinking about it you actually extrapolated a point i commonly make to others that i absolutely missed here for my own thinking whether in person or online ive seen a few times people say why doesnt xcountry fight fair be a man for one example being the gulf war where if youre this aware youre likely aware that the iraqi military was a shell of what people try to brag it was from purged generals and pilots to absolutely unserviceable aircraft to a completely incompetent chain of command largely because of demoralized conscripts jailed leadership and technical staff and a destroyed iraqi economy as well as idiotic political control of the military people will say well if iraq had <number> airplanes why didnt the us just go it alone and attack with <number> airplanes and be a man instead of attacking with all these other countries and <number> airplanes thats an exact quote from somebody ive had this argument with not my numbers to which im like are you seriously asking why they didnt fight fairly its war fighting fairly in war is not fighting to win war is literally the absolute worst abomination of anything humanity can do this isnt a boxing match this isnt an mma match this isnt a basketball game this is humans turning other humans into pieces of hamburger meat as efficiently as possible creating countless orphans widows destroyed families and businesses etc its war fighting fairly and not cheating is not fighting to win by that logic no one should ever introduce new weapons in the middle of a war that bring favor to their own side because its not fair like when germans cried in world war i that americans using shotguns in trench combat in close quarters was too deadlybasically cheating and too effective the germans actually said that any american found that surrendered or was injured with a shotgun in their possession or shotgun shells would be immediately executed or the geneva conventions trying to say that if youre a tank crew member and you shoot somebody with the heavy machine gun on the tank which would blow a human apart is inhumane and therefore you must use the coaxial medium machine gun which is typically a <number> its irrational and holds no basis people think wars still like some somewhat gentlemanly affair like lines of infantry firing muskets in s at somewhat mutually planned battles this usually shuts them up,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNWxIZDhvQkk1dEJMT1ZLdlBScVFvU0xNOWZlT0l0ZXZwemdhSTM2dHIzVkxOcE54aTludVVrNUVuejlLR3VVRHlEMHVHd1VFcHF4SkZtSW9wQnpWYkE9PQ==

thats a bit of a tricky question the short answer is no pastoralists steppe people acquired most of the metal armor and weapons they had through trade or violence with settled neighbors however after the mongols started conquering folks they took over cities and other settlements which produced weapons and other specialized tools there is evidence though that various steppe peoples at times exercised a sort of loose overlordship over cities and towns near the steppe they could exploit their control of the hinterlands to pressure settlements into paying them tribute which likely took many forms including armor and weapons,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNUpjaEk2SlAxQVpCU01rN0pxeUNSWFg0dE40R2NXNmg1Z3NmUFdPeWlRV2J2UTdaSEtoZnNucG5IUEh1VG9SaEszdnQtSEN5eUp0RzRPeV91LUNrWGc9PQ==

it starts to get very difficult to do a proper comparison because engineering data is not available instead people say that ground pressure is equal to force divided by area and they use the weight of the vehicle divided by the contact patch of the treads area of the treads in contact with the ground this calculation specifically ignores the factor i discussed above which is that weight is not evenly distributed across the tread in reality there are a variety of factors that impact the ground pressure along the length of the tank theres a difference between dynamic pressure versus static pressure etc at the end of the day any detailed engineering or test data is not provided to the public and the basic ground pressure is just an engineering rule of thumb where you still test the vehicle to make sure it performs how you want we still have the basic rule of thumb that more road wheels is equal to less pressure but how exactly that shakes out depends on those other factors the main answer is that most of them just weigh less mainly because tank doctrine discarded the concept of medium vs heavy tanks versus a force just made up of an allaround main battle tank in short tons <number> lbs the tiger <number> tank was <number> tons and the tiger <number> tank was <number> tons the m started at around <number> tons the m abrams started at around <number> tons the t<number> started at <number> tons the t<number> started at <number> tons the t<number> started at <number> tons its only in the last <number><number> years where weve seen tanks significantly above <number> tons and into <number> tons as designers have retrofit additional technology and protection onto legacy tanks such as the m abrams and leopard <number> the ma sep v tips the scales at <number> tons the leopard av comes in at <number> tons these tanks can exceed <number> tons with optional equipment to be clear the modern tanks have a lot more surplus capability to operate within the tiger <number> and tiger <number> could already be slow and fragile under the right conditions so you add <number> tons onto the design weight and it collapses under its own weight or becomes totally immobile modern tanks have modern powerplants transmissions and suspensions all of which are much better and much higher quality than the ww equivalent consider a <number> model year ford truck compared to a <number> model year ford truck but those systems seem to be reaching or are above their practical limit im sure theyre seeing increased maintenance and breakdowns as a result its already reported that these vehicles are facing mobility transportation and recovery challenges due to their weight these arent major challenges in a coin environment in the desert but they are much more problematic in mechanized warfare its also important to be realistic about what is achievable the initial russian invasion into ukraine was entirely russian equipment designed with russian mud in mind plenty of their lighter tanks and other afvs got stuck in the mud some to the point of abandonment so of course an <number> ton abrams is at higher risk of getting stuck in the mud but the <number> ton soviet tank can get itself plenty stuck as well,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYURnOS1CNUxlUEV1Wm5ISVdhVEtRWmpsU2hDbFJaeUxuRkJRMlE4VnhUXy1MR0dKV0tWeDdHUmVYTURmTi12RHMyQ1BQWVNIYjJoRUIyWUdNUW1QdkE9PQ==

the situation was different then we had a different threat they thought we would most likely be fighting in places that are not nearpeers because there were no nearpeers to the us at that time that meant having a ship that could deploy lots of cheap but accurate ammunition in littoral zones which has the advantage of being the place where most of the world lives airpower is also crazy expensive compared to what these guns could offer imagine being able to control a littoral area with this ship freeing up air resources for further inland a ship can have <number> time on station if it wants which i assume would be helpful in some situations and before todays missiles existed they knew about the distance issue of the guns and also that some countries did have missiles that would threaten the ship thats why they made it a stealth ship also they wouldnt put it in harms way it would have been used via some combined arms package that could make up for its weaknesses i agree with you that it didnt age well but i think the planners made a decent decision based on the world we thought we would see they are currently refitting the zumwalts to fire a whole slew of large hypersonic weapons so i think its value might actually go up in the future to be fair i guess the zumwalts value cant exactly go down at this point,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncmI0SThTUXFCOUFwRHVKdDlWaHV1Q0l1S2dBVVJveHpTdWpRLXpqZGlSTG5tSWFMWXh0LTF2akwxcTl2ZlJJdVZMRkNCUFp3dkVvTXB6SWxkUVJGcHc9PQ==

as to why the marine corps and army division structures are different you have to understand history prior to the s both the army and marine corps was organized as squads>platoons>companies>battalions>regiments>division they were organized as triangular units meaning that each regiment had <number> battalions with <number> companies each which controlled <number> rifle platoons and a weapons platoon however in the s there was an experiment conducted known as the pentomic army in the beginning of the nuclear age it was thought that nuclear weapons would dominate the future of warfare that any future war would start and end with a nuclear weapons exchange and land forces such as the army and marine corps would be relegated to occupying nuclear wastes while the navy would have no job as they <number> didnt have nuclear delivery platforms at the time <number> would not be needed because a nuclear exchange would not necessitate the need to have a navy this would cause the revolt of the admirals but thats a story for another time when eisenhower entered office he was looking to reduce expenditure while maintaining the ability to defend itself using nuclear weapons as such navy and army funding would drop while air force funding would sky rocket to the point that in <number> the air force had a budget larger than the army and navy combined with this backdrop the army would develop a army structure that could survive in a nuclear battlefield this would become the pentomic army in this the battalion was removed as an echelon and the battlegroup would takeover the role of the regiment though the battlegroup would maintain the history and traditions of its parent regiment the division would have <number> of these battlegroups a battle group would have <number> companies in the infantry battle group case and <number> companies in the airborne battle group case with each company being reinforced now consisting of <number> rifle platoons and a weapons platoon the battlegroup would also receive habitual attachments in the form of a <number> gun battery of mm howitzer and a <number> tank armor company the artillery battery would later be enlarged to an artillery battalion in the <number> the way it was imagine to be employed was that the battlegroups would act primarily as resistance islands in the defense where the area which the battle groups defend were spotty in nature rather than the contiguous lines seen in ww ww and korea in the defense a battlegroup was expected to defend a circumference of ~m with the individual platoon expected to defend a frontage of m so they were incredibly dispersed while in the offense the battlegroups had to be concentrated which would not be a big issue had the division been given enough transport to do so they were not as the divisional trains would only have <number> apc companies and <number> truck company with each apc company meant to be able to carry <number> battle group at a time in both the defense and offense it was expected that the tactical nuclear weapons of the division would destroy or break up the enemy enabling the division to conduct its operations this structure however was incredibly flawed in that they relied on tactical nuclear weapons for survival maneuver through a nuclear environment was untested and relied on technology that was not in service another one of the major issues that became apparent was the span of control for commanders was too large in the old structure the regimental commander had to only control <number> maneuver elements and supporting assets while the battlegroup commander had to control <number> separate maneuver elements followed by supporting assets this was too much of a strain on the commander thus in <number> the army reevaluated the army structure and developed the road army the major difference in the road division compared to the pentomic division is the introduction of the brigade headquarters and the reintroduction of the battalion in the road division each division would have <number> in infantry and mechanized divisions or <number> armored division only battalions which can then be task organized under one of three brigade headquarters in practice they were habitual organization which would remain more or less fixed in organization this would remain as roughly the main organization for army divisions until the <number> reorganization plan for the us army making brigade combat teams permanent organizations made up of organic battalions throughout this units had regimental designations for history purposes only the us marine corps didnt go through any of this and thus kept their structure of divisions regiments battalion,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUlVwRHhNektBRVI3TEE4b0JOUXRDQUtOOFd4MTJwNUcxbzFHV2lubDQ1NTRaTFpwVEV1NlJva2oyUUk0bWk5bTlvTFBmM3VwcTJQSGZyWWt4NEM0WXc9PQ==

legion cohorts and centuries were standardize unit during the roman empire after the collapse of the empire things were not really standardize resources were too decentralized to create a permanent army the soldiers that fought had to move around to where war were happening or join a temporary army in time of war or were working for a noble doing other military task during peace time training guard security taxes etc company actually this unit have a very social origin a lot of research show that human are able to maintain relationship with <number> to <number> people and in most of history the main social military unit have been around this size the <number> men centuria the <number> men maniple or the more company all played a similar role even the word company come from companionship now i dont know exactly when the word company started to be use but even in medieval europe when military unit were not standardize you still have small group of men <number><number> who were under the command of a captain which was more of a title at the time it just meant the leader of the group the spanish tercio had <number> companies each lead by a captain and the first tercio was in <number> platoon come from the french peleton which seem to have come from <number> this started as a firing unit each companies would be divided into lines that would firing together as a volley the platoon might have became an official unit under the swedish in <number> but this isnt clear battalion came from the dutch who were fighting the spanish tercio during the eighty years war <number><number> the tercio was the best military at the time and the spanish the richest empire while the dutch were a relatively small nation they had to use a lot of innovation and one of the them was the battalion you can see more info on that here<url> but basically the dutch took inspiration from the roman who used the more maneuverable maniple to win against the more powerful but slower phalanx a tercio was <number><number> men while a dutch battalion was <number><number> men it was a lot easier to command tactically this is why even today the battalion is the main tactical unit and they were deployed in checkered formation so that they could retreat reinforce or flank as needed regiment just like companies are an older concept even when it wasnt a standard military unit a few thousand people were just easier for administration which is why even today regiment are usually an administration unit only the word regiment came from the french even if the concept is older and the older regiment still in service is the french st regiment from <number> the point of the regiment was usually to recruit train and equip units for war on the battlefield those were usually company then later the battalion the tercio was a regiment type unit but they used it as a tactical unit on the battlefield brigade was a temporary unit because at this point the size of armies were just too large im not sure if the italian or french used it first but it really started to get tracking after gustavus adolphus started to use it to great effect on the battlefield btw gustavus adolphus in the th century took all of the above and really standardized it and improved it into what we know today division the next big step in military organization come the french first in theory by the marshal of france later in practice during the seven years war <number><number> before this point each unit had a type infantry cavalry artillery etc the division combined multiple type of military unit into one command this made commanding much easier since each division commander had the tools to complete his mission or take care of his portion of the front without having to rely on other unit to support him corps this one came from napoleon in <number> at this point the mass conscription made the size of the army unmanageable the idea behind the corps was to create several mini self sufficient armies that would be commanded by a trusted general corps could spread out during marches which would speed unit the unit not everybody need to walk on the same road more area to live off the land etc but could concentrate for battle breaking the lines of communication was not a big deal since a corps had everything it need and a trusted general to lead them this make the overall command of an army much easier,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnS214WGpuVEtSdklKR2NhTVJzZ2VZX0trYWJPczRBLWhjXy1iSFlvWGh4dk9nbFRIWHV5a0JqV2k4Q1UtXzdZb2ZRY3d6NldHRjRBRmtMSUstamRxV0pFd2U0Vl9aS2ludWFLM2ZOMWtwSmc9

to add to your timing is everything theme and to add some data as utheonetruedemoknights point below on why data is necessary if you were in the army air forces in europe early in the war it was an achievement to get to <number> missions as a bomber crew at which point youd get to go home later in the war especially with air superiority achieved the number of missions required to get sent home increased a sign that survival rates for army aircrew got better as the war progressed meanwhile youd think the navy had it better in <number> than early in the war right but the navys own records would say otherwise <url> granted this is very crude stuff youd have to look at individual records to get the truth data but in <number> with ~<number> million in the navy <number> strength on <number> december <number> add ~k enlisting in <number> there <number> killed in action in <number> or if you go off the peak strength which would likely be the at the end of <number> that was <number> killed in <number> peak strength is listed as <number> jul <number> with <number> in the navy in <number> however <number> were killed so if you compare that to the peak that was <number> killed a <number> higher rate albeit still small overall than in <number> so it really comes down to what phase of the conflict you entered and what job you had a bomber guy in europe in <number> would absolutely have it worse than the guy showing up in <number> however a navy guy on a destroyer in <number> in pacific isnt dealing with kamikazes like in <number> off okinawa or in action in preparation for the final push on japan,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnampZMDcwVWZoalpCUUh4V3p4azljRTJTbnRhUHNiQ3E5Um9RNEFaSGZvMVNZNjN6N1h2VUVmYjhnSXVTMWg4dFp0YXhTX1FkQ2tuQ3hKb3hPOTZBSmc9PQ==

the us army on several occasions accomplished strategic level encirclements some examples falaise following the breakout from normandy the allies met in falaise having encircled army group b german human losses were around <number> <number> kia remainder prisoners and effectively all heavy equipment of german forces committed to the battle in france mons us st army encircled and destroyed several german formations in exchange for <number> us kia <number>+ germans were captured ruhr us forces encircle and capture <number> germans your impression is one of those classici listen to what hoi players on the internet say positions i dont mean this in a disparaging way exactly but theres a tendency to hold up german operations as strategic genius while being only dimly aware of allied ones because thats just kind of the perverse rule of cool that comes with ww gaming this isnt to fall into a hagiography of course but theres a tendency to reduce the us army to an artillery dispenser without really understanding either the accomplishments of the army how it fought or the problems it faced to an example when it was in terrain that inhibited maneuver hedgerows of normandy limited roads and rough country of the ardennes more attritional warfare was practiced while this is often described as some sort of american weaknessi mean look at the german attacks in the same sectors the same force on force artillery centric battles because thats what the terrain supported when the countryside was open such as postcobra in france or postrhine crossing the us army completed significant maneuvers as detailed above in addition to quite a few smaller tactical encirclements as thats more or less what the us armored force was designed to do,r/warcollege,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUdGNnFWOEs0bDJNY3lobUE5T3NnM0hfU21lNkdBU1FTazFRelE0NDZtXzJLaWtNV2lCY2RQdGw1WWdyUUEtbDJpb1dsOGRVb1gtMzNLQXpyUjVNOXpBOTRhSGxBSmk4X3FidlFPREVQUE09
