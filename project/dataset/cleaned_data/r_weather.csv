the snowy winter sound more believable to me it doesnt take much to go from having <number><number> snow days a winter to <number><number> snowy days each winter and <number> snow days are enough to remember a snowy winter from my experience people dont remember a less than average snow year but they notice if there isnt a single snow day all winter and at least in germany that has now happened a few times people are almost begging in the way they speak about winter for it to snow just so everything feels normal again similarly people notice that instead of <number> or <number> days above c we now have weeks with such temperatures and <number><number> days above c so even if its just <number> or <number> degrees above average people are right when they say we never had such extreme summers for example thats at least true here in germany there also is a huge difference in how days feel if its just a bit hotter near body temperature the drop of in energy to work or concentrate between <number> and <number> is much harsher than between <number> and <number> degrees people notice this interestingly this summer is truly an exception in germany since record keeping began in the th century we never had such a rainy summer or <number> months for that matter the feeling that this weather and climate isnt right is i believe justified and not just a wishful interpretation of climate change even if our memory is misleading as to the exact reasons our experience of climate has already changed of course ageing etc also plays a factor in how different we experience the climate i always try to give such factual information what actually changed if people communicate such feelings of change it really gives climate change a personal relation because you have experience matching what the theories say and that helps people understand on a level raw data will just never be able to and given that there still is a huge gap between scientific understanding and personal and public decision making every bit of awareness and understanding matters or humanity is doomed,r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN2xoZzVobVlTV2Y3TlZFUUhlcDZuUE1nR3VBUzRhMFBPTzlqZmZYTUhUSUEtQ3AtYzV6TTZLZ2NpOHhjdWxNdEplM3RydmJELW9sRXc5S0l3Rk9XaEE9PQ==

those are not sun dogs they dont come in pairs next to each other and these are also too tilted for sun dogs by looking at this photo these look like short patches of primary and secondary rainbows to me and the fact that the colors were reversed just confirms the rainbow theory as well the secondary bow has the same colors as the primary but just in a reversed order the radius of the primary bow is <number> and <number> for the secondary that makes them around <number> degrees apart at the max its really hard to estimate the correct distance without any tools but id say your <number> degree estimate got pretty close edit some more info about rainbows edit <number> corrected the primary radius <number> > <number>,r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUjNQcEg2QVNwSGZUakZ0SlB3emFyS0xuMjduT2NtTWJzRDA2OVFramFqMVJhcnduUDdocWJzOTRWcF82TlAyeWhxN19YOTRyRGtJY3QyZjNhdl91Ykg2MUJiQlJnQ0lxUV9KZFAwR2NveHc9

sorry but as a journalist this is the opposite of giving information possible tornadoes almost everywhere its clickbaity and essentially useless a couple options come to mind ten tornado warnings in effect across chicagoland or six confirmed tornadoes as storms race east more informative more to the point,r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZGlfMHRzdXF3YkxOdkFES00ydExLdXNuUHJIMUN2SHVkSkxhQzA0clpjYnBubG9jZkNmMG1xZFd3OEdTTkVmY2FoZnBUZEpWRHg4UEpMLXQzZk5zSGc9PQ==
news stations arent allowed to say confirmed until the nws officially rates them but there were six distinct cc drops maybe even more i think this message is fine tbh it conveys just how serious the situation is and honestly with how powerful this storm was literally every last person in mchenry lake cook will and kankakee county should have been taking cover i know a lot of people from the more rural parts down past joliet that absolutely do not consider themselves part of chicagoland but seeing almost everywhere would get their attention i also know plenty of people who just ignore tornado warnings now but telling them that there are actual tornadoes on the ground will get them to seek shelter,r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneUxWcE5ZcEtOQTh0dzJldkx0SFBld2NKVGhKTlQ1dlhPVjFpN3IxN2RqMzNLNUlIN1dhaElLSFV6b2xGVERldk05bExXZVJKbGJKTk1LcnRHQTdYWmlGUDNDZ1phellfUno4NmZ3eXU1OFk9

southern suburbs here we are safe and somehow still have power it flickered a lot when the storms first arrived it looked and sounded like a damn hurricane came through those winds lasted only about <number><number> minutes but were enough to make me uneasy i was in full panic mode all day but thankful nothing seems to be damaged our power has still flickered a few times since the storms rolled through last night but my guess is there may be a branch or something on the powerlines outside still too dark to tell at the moment though scary night but im glad its finally over,r/weather,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnc1pTUjlsSWhKMTJLYUZQakxSSjZRbWEyU0o5TEhzN0hCeTNYZmppc2lJUDNBQVU2WjlBMmsxcmpiTmpXdi1QaDhsb19OYXFhcldqWVpCLW5ESzdmQkE9PQ==
