it was at least initially funded by smaller donations meanwhile the various blocked funding and so on really doesnt amount to net worth and has never really been available to either assange or wikileaks thanks to the expected us state department scummery and remember that a lot of papers and individual journalists even many who publically dismiss assange as inconsequential have earned absurd amounts of money from reporting based on the wikileaks foundation and also from the wikileaks model as in digital anonymous deaddrops so when it comes to private donations to take care of at least some of the problems i dont think theres been any lack of those even just from private actors in the mediabusiness itself even with the worst tabloids who couldnt care less about pressfreedom assange was a popular and controversial subject to report on and so was the content assange and anyone like him will always be a liability to people in power but keep in mind that even the slavishly deferential media outlets that generally follow the prescribed narratives see the value of wikileaks controversies i remember one donation i saw when working for a pac in the us it was a spitedonation they wanted someone on the opposite side to specifically grill their own candidate that was done and no one checked the lists or asked questions so i assume that was not uncommon its kind of a game but i dont think there has been any lack of donations for assange papers and publishers are no doubt looking for as they were when he was first arrested ways to fund bookdeals and things like that as in even before any actual sympathy and interest in the important pressfreedom aspects of this case is involved long before legal bills and promotion of the case remove that entire aspect and assange would likely still have managed to receive donations enough to keep the lights on and more,r/wikileaks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERUtmbU1NdDg2MGhzTm9qS0FsUjh0MGlyOHRGcmJGbWczcmFLY1d5RmJLeDFjbHJaR1lSc3ZGQTBRODFJNHBmLXNCV3d1d2s2WjE2ZGYxRmdZUGVtVEE9PQ==

generally if you get deported or evacuated from a foreign country your government has to pay for the costs of your deportationevacuation the us government generally sends you a bill for such services once you get home this is one of the reasons they recommend you evacuate by yourself through commercial airlines asap once some conflict in some country is about to start else people could simply use it as a way to travel for free i imagine the charter was setup to avoid the extra headlines and potential issues so theres nothing surprising here how exactly do you expect assange or his wife to provide proof that the australian government chartered the plane without really giving them any options its probably one of those things where theyd tell you not to worry that youll sort it out later,r/wikileaks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNENXVqVVNnaE1mV0F6M0daNnRJbVliR2U2dmhqX0FMRk9iVzE5bEVQREVQd25QRzBrTWxNeEtrSHZIcjZQSHdtbnM0RWhRR3JKQWtNdG92c21ic1hYU0E9PQ==

>the british lawyers representing the us government concluded they would run into an ethical obligation to drop the case because of their duty of candor they could no longer argue for extradition when a condition required by the court had not been met pffh hahaha so what youre reading here is a justice department moron inventing something mostly out of whole cloth to create the image of that the plea deal was actually a clever move perhaps that phrase has been used once in a movie or something but that willing to bet many sterling silver talents on that just completely made up the wp will print anything their insiders tell them to without any investigation or second sources whatsoever the only secondary source suggested here is the wikileaks editor who suggests the right to appeal from may was a turning point no no chance what has changed is the realization that prosecuting assange for what the punditry and the political figures have already judged him for in a court would be a spectacle they wouldnt be able to handle in terms of pr so the actual report they should have written is that the us waited out the clock on something that couldnt possibly have worked out without heavy problems perhaps hoping the conditions would be right to get some opportunity to get away with it in court probably by someone utterly ignorant of the law meanwhile the cia has tried to off the guy how many times this has been waited out knowing full well that that was the best outcome they could hope for ruin assanges life by using political pressure on an ally and keep him entrenched in a legal battle while threatening believably to just send him to gitmo whether hes guilty or not or whether the ruling would be controversial or whatever and now that its over theyre blaming procedural prudence from the courts that produced barristers who basically wrote down the arguments the us state department clones required and produced it in court mostly under secrecy to the point of trying to prosecute journalists who reported on what they said bullshit,r/wikileaks,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFeXE4NlVDbWRyNkxYOEdyNG5oWEViVmlfU081TWEybG4tbmxXa0tpOUlwSnVJTU5PbnFTd3VqYWJzbWtZUXFJckVXbWdCSXNCTW80elRydS1jOWt5cHc9PQ==
