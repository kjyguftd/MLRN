"“This election is about voting against Trump, and Biden’s age changes nothing about that.” 

 You are correct, this is true for people like you and me and most everyone else on this sub or in politics who is aware of the stakes. The mistake in your thinking is extrapolating this to all voters.  

 Far from a “rare breed” I’d argue the majority of voters are some variation of unaware/uncaring about the issue of democracy/risks of Trump, and a non-insignificant number will decide their vote based on how the candidates perform publicly. 1-2% of voters flipping for Trump because Biden acts old can be what puts Trump in the white house given how close this race is. *That* is why people are panicking. 

 It’s not about people like us who will vote no matter what against Trump, it’s always been about the voters who can be swayed/convinced to either. Biden’s campaign pushed for the debate to show that although Biden is old, he doesn’t act old, and he acted old, so people are now questioning if running Biden is now riskier than going for an (unknown) other candidate.",r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQX2ZtMDM4NzNidzNtOHYtSmMxQUdFZFVIYXBhczZtQmE2eUhmWjVOdG50SzJpRS1OdGVZX2VxYnp3WW1DNS11SG42TmtSNGJ0ZnFLcF9Vbjdlem81SlE9PQ==

It makes no sense given his economy, platform and fundraising, as well as going against Trump with 34 felony counts - that establishment Dems would go against establishment Biden.

IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE...unless you consider one very important fact...

In 2016, Russia hacked both the DNC and the RNC. The GOP immediately fell in line behind Trump. Even Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham, who all loathed Trump. Because that's what Putin wanted.

And now, what are we seeing? Establishment Dems backpeddling on Biden. Not new Dems. Established Dems who were around in 2016, who may have had emails swept up in the hack. This also benefits Putin, as it impacts the funding and resources for Ukraine.

"A network of Russia-based websites masquerading as local American newspapers is pumping out fake stories as part of an AI-powered operation that is increasingly targeting the US election, a BBC investigation can reveal.  A former Florida police officer who relocated to Moscow is one of the key figures behind it.  The following would have been a bombshell report - if it were true.  Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, allegedly bought a rare Bugatti Tourbillon sports car for 4.5m euros ($4.8m; £3.8m) while visiting Paris for D-Day commemorations in June. The source of the funds was supposedly American military aid money.

The story appeared on an obscure French website just days ago - and was swiftly debunked.  Experts pointed out strange anomalies on the invoice posted online. A whistleblower cited in the story appeared only in an oddly edited video that may have been artificially created. Bugatti issued a sharp denial, calling it ""fake news"", and its Paris dealership threatened legal action against the people behind the false story.  But before the truth could even get its shoes on, the lie had gone viral. Influencers had already picked up the false story and spread it widely.

One X user, the pro-Russia, pro-Donald Trump activist Jackson Hinkle, posted a link seen by more than 6.5m people. Several other accounts spread the story to millions more X users – at least 12m in total, according to the site’s metrics.
It was a fake story, on a fake news website, designed to spread widely online, with its origins in a Russia-based disinformation operation BBC Verify first revealed last year - at which point the operation appeared to be trying to undermine Ukraine’s government.

Our latest investigation, carried out over more than six months and involving the examination of hundreds of articles across dozens of websites, found that the operation has a new target - American voters.  Dozens of bogus stories tracked by the BBC appear aimed at influencing US voters and sowing distrust ahead of November’s election. Some have been roundly ignored but others have been shared by influencers and members of the US Congress.  The story of the Bugatti hit many of the top themes of the operation – Ukrainian corruption, US aid spending, and the inner workings of French high society.
Another fake which went viral earlier this year was more directly aimed at American politics.

It was published on a website called The Houston Post – one of dozens of sites with American-sounding names which are in reality run from Moscow - and alleged that the FBI illegally wiretapped Donald Trump’s Florida resort. It played neatly into Trump’s allegations that the legal system is unfairly stacked against him, that there is a conspiracy to thwart his campaign, and that his opponents are using dirty tricks to undermine him. Mr Trump himself has accused the FBI of snooping on his conversations.  Experts say that the operation is just one part of a much larger ongoing effort, led from Moscow, to spread disinformation during the US election campaign.  While no hard evidence has emerged that these particular fake news websites are run by the Russian state, researchers say the scale and sophistication of the operation is broadly similar to previous Kremlin-backed efforts to spread disinformation in the West.  “Russia will be involved in the US 2024 election, as will others,” said Chris Krebs, who as the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was responsible for ensuring the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.  “We're already seeing them - from a broader information operations perspective on social media and elsewhere - enter the fray, pushing against already contentious points in US politics,” he said.  The BBC contacted the Russian Foreign Ministry and Russia’s US and UK embassies, but received no response. We also attempted to contact Mr Hinkle for comment.

Ironically, many of the same ultra-feminist Hillary Clinton supporters who went around calling everyone who they didn’t agree with a “Russian stooge” were in fact espousing a Stasi era feminist agenda that alienated the electorate and ultimately helped elect Trump. I would imagine that yes there is absolutely infiltration into these extremist feminist groups because I knew some of these self proclaimed “witches” in college personally. They are fundamentally anti-capitalist and perceive the entire western rules-based order as part of this “hetero-normative patriarchy” or whatever. 

Through that lens, it’s easier for an influence campaign to hijack and call the Ukrainian self defense some extension of the patriarchy or something.

"Pretty sure that “boycott tractor supply” post, the one with the “burn the patriarchy Gaza flag” flair, was one of the posts in question.

They are trying to boycott anything that isn’t 110% woke. They’re a tractor supply company who meets the needs of farmers, not an inner city nonprofit. Farmers are a humble people. There is no DEI success in tractor supply. It’s all old white dudes, how are they supposed to implement a DEI agenda?

And because they won’t, now freaking tractors are part of the patriarchy?

Who wins from boycotting the tractor supply?

Hmmmm

Now Russia has hijacked 1/3rd of global wheat supply, a similarly sizable chunk of global potash fertilizer and about half of the fertile Ukrainian black soil. That post in particular is designed to help the Russians in their Dekulakization efforts. It’s a shame that this went right over your head.

The sad part about this is that my green agenda is being hijacked by the DEI people. Now every culture war post I’ve seen attempts to lump together lowering carbon emissions with pride parades. What the fuck? What does an electric tractor have to do with sucking a ding dong? Nothing. The Russians, Exxon, neo-conservatives, OPEC and everyone else against the green transition LOVE the woke agenda because it is the perfect boogeyman to associate climate action with. Now my solar rooftops and electric tractors are associated with Larry Fink’s corporate board sex quotas, setting them up for failure.

"Okay, with you using words like ""woke"" and having an overall narrow view of the benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion makes it really difficult for me to care about your opinions and strawman arguments, but I've got some free time, so I'll bite.

>They’re a tractor supply company who meets the needs of farmers, not an inner city nonprofit. 

>And because they won’t, now freaking tractors are part of the patriarchy?

You do realize that Tractor Supply doesn't actually sell tractors, right? It even lists it on their website: ""What can you buy at Tractor Supply Company? Everything except tractors."" They sell lawn mowers. They're not John Deere.

>Who wins from boycotting the tractor supply?

So, were you on board with the conservative activist Robby Starbuck when he was calling to boycott Tractor Supply back in 2022 for their LGBTQ+ and DEI hiring initiatives? A boycott which has lead to them backtracking on said initiatives? Did that boycott not ""help Russia"" more as you put it?

Also, again, ""Tractor Supply"" is the proper noun of that company. They don't actually supply tractors.

>It’s all old white dudes, how are they supposed to implement a DEI agenda?

Sure, let's just ignore the 40,000 Black farmers in America. And, it's just old white dudes? They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but maybe they can surprise us all and learn what the rest of the world already knows: diversity brings better ideas, innovation, and, guess what - profits. If they can figure out how to drive a tractor, I'm pretty sure they can handle a DEI agenda.

>The sad part about this is that my green agenda is being hijacked by the DEI people. Now every culture war post I’ve seen attempts to lump together lowering carbon emissions with pride parades. What the fuck? What does an electric tractor have to do with sucking a ding dong? Nothing. The Russians, Exxon, neo-conservatives, OPEC and everyone else against the green transition LOVE the work agenda because it is the perfect boogeyman to associate climate action with.

Okay, this entire paragraph is just a rant, but I'll try to turn things into a constructive discussion in the glow of the light of this burning strawman.

You're worried that Larry Fink and BlackRock's talk about diversity and the environment is somehow throwing a wrench in the works of going green. But let's be real here - having diverse voices isn't going to ruin the planet. In fact, it might actually help save it.

Imagine this: bringing in folks from all sorts of backgrounds leads to fresh ideas and creative solutions. Shocking, right? Diversity and green practices aren’t like oil and water - they actually mix quite well. More diverse minds mean more innovation, and guess what? Even more support for those fancy new electric tractors. So yeah, let’s stop pretending diversity is some kind of kryptonite to progress. Keeping the same old dogs in the boardroom is going to result in the same old tricks. Women and People of Color are more Left-leaning. And do you know which side supports the green agenda more? Spoilers, it ain't the Right.

As for Tractor Supply, boycotts are a legit way for folks to push for change when they see something wrong. A lot of the comments in that post on ""Witches Vs Patriarchy"" discussed shopping locally instead of using the chain Tractor Supply. Shopping local can support the community and may even reduce our environmental footprint. That doesn't seem very pro-Russia to me.

In the end, Tractor Supply caters to hobby farmers, small-scale farmers, and rural homeowners. If you're really worried about agricultural production in the US, boycotting Tractor Supply isn't going to phase it. DuPont Pioneer and John Deere, they are not.

And now getting back to the original post I was commenting on . . .

"Biden’s sole objective was to “mend the soul” of America after the Charlottesville tiki torch march where white nationalists shouted “Jews will not replace us” with his domestic policy agenda. 19,000,000 colorblind union jobs would give those people “replaced” by globalization and offshoring the dignity of work for a livable wage. They were invited to drop the tiki torch, pick up a shovel and pursue the American dream. And sure enough, Biden built back the manufacturing industry for chips, solar panels, building materials, cars and sustainable farming that was previously offshored to China during Neoliberal globalization. The financial times calls it “green nationalism” and on paper it worked… in theory.

Then enters Biden’s advisors.

They ran some polls with focus groups and suggested that it wasn’t enough. Biden’s moderate appeal was losing support of the base, in particular black voters in Georgia. The political calculus to give an olive branch to the tiki torchers wasn’t enough to bolster Biden’s black support, if anything, eroded it the advisors argued. Now Biden’s advisors were telling him not only to ignore the original mending of the soul with a bipartisan unity approach, but to actively pour jet fuel on the tiki torches with DEI and “woke” rhetoric to appeal to the far-left democrat base.

Biden’s advisors hijacked the steering wheel and abandoned the bipartisan agenda in favor of the “orange man bad” agenda.

Not only did this anger the far-right, but now the far-left calls him “genocide Joe” for supporting Israeli self defense. So all of that political calculus from the inflation reduction act, infrastructure bill and CHIPS act creating jobs in red states — wasted. That is why Newt Gingrich said democrats don’t know the cost of eggs in 1994 — the advisors erased any empathy for the disenfranchised and continued to demonize them as “deplorable” just like Hillary Clinton did. The advisors wasted the sole purpose of the domestic policy agenda to mend the soul of the electorate and promote unity. And for what? Cheap political one-liners designed to win Georgia. Well now we lost Pennsylvania, apparently, and Wisconsin too. Great fucking job.

That being said, Trump is a mobster. The people in his administration who didn’t leave and denounce him were all mobsters, even his donors. But the PEOPLE who voted for him were not mobsters — they were just trying to feed their families. The Biden advisors don’t understand this nuance. So not only will Biden lose the election due to his rapidly progressing Parkinson’s, but he would have lost because his advisors manipulated him to abandon the SOLE PURPOSE of his campaign: empathize with the disenfranchised workers. Instead of calling them honest workers, he called them “ultra-MAGA” republicans to feed into the democrat base hysteria, demonizing them as Nazis for cheap political points.

So in summary, yes, having the Russian and Israeli mob run another Trump administration is quite possibly a constitutional crisis. But that doesn’t mean the political rhetoric of the Biden administration should be 100% “orange man bad” hysteria. They are not Nazis—they are hangry. When they go low, we go high.

Those republicans are correct in their sentiment. Biden’s rhetoric has become sensationalized race bait that divides us into us-vs-them rather than bring the left and right together. Instead of unity of left and right, they chose unity *of the democratic base*. I say that as one of Biden’s original ghost writers.

But now they call him genocide Joe. So that was all wasted. You can thank his advisors for fucking up my unity agenda. If the shooter was in fact radicalized by this rhetoric, and that “orange man bad” sentiment is confirmed to be his motive, then you can absolutely thank those advisors for this as blowback of their hysterical rhetoric. They called him an ""existential threat"" and some autist took it literally and treated him like one.

>A local police officer saw the gunman just before he fired on a Donald Trump rally Saturday but was unable to engage him, Butler County Sheriff Michael T. Slupe said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post.

>Slupe told The Post that the officer was examining the area after there were requests from law enforcement to identify a suspicious person. 

>“So police responded to try to find the guy, searched the area, but couldn’t find him, so said, ‘Well, let’s try the roof,’” Slupe said. 

>Slupe said the officer pulled himself up enough to look on the roof and see the gunman, who also saw the officer and pointed his gun at the officer. 

>“He lets go because he doesn’t want to get killed,” Slupe said. The gunman then started firing.

>CNN reported earlier that the shooter was spotted outside the event by local law enforcement, who thought he might’ve been acting suspiciously near the walk-through metal detectors, according to a senior law enforcement official. They put out a call over the radio to keep an eye on him, and that information was passed on to Secret Service, the source said.",r/activemeasures,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOUh5NlF2OWFuWnF5N01YWDdsZ29xbFpySGh4eHZuLUpFRGJ0ZGNrZ1Y0U3BUMmZZdVZ2V1dJRXQtNU9QcnBpNHlKb0dEendlSlFHUUJ4VDhRd05iU2c9PQ==
