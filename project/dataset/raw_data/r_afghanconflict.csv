"The one thing which Pakistani partnership would allow, however, is having relationships with both of the states sandwiching the Wakhan Corridor.

At the very least, it would allow for a very defensable stronghold in light of its remoteness. At the very most, if China does come around to backing or building a road through Wakhan, the new trade resulting from that could be ""taxed"" the way some Taliban ""taxed"" the Ring Road back in the day. 

Between those two ends of the spectrum, a secure Wakhan would provide a narrow but immediate front for expansion along the remainder of the Tajik border. I only worry about Pakistan connecting with any resistance orgs as a sting operation to sell them out to the emirate.",r/afghanconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjV3d4TG9HUmx1Nm1IdkxwaXhQWVUwV1Z3clhrcXhLYnlTR21MVHZZR0VYMzl5QjNpU0dUanZxNlluaEtrRGFJMmE2SGpXNENnaTdpSTF6eWN5THRjcVE9PQ==
"Assuming the allegation concerns the NRF & AFF, and not ISKP, it would be the first time that Pakistan chose the non-fanatical and non-Pashtun side in the fight.

I think the bigger concern is whether this would be, if true, a sting operation on the part of the ISI to get good with the Taliban. If not, I only see this as an improvement, especially if the leadership isn't going to switch out and no new groups seem to be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. 

If nothing else, any intensified NRF or AFF activity could grant new groups the bandwidth to form beneath the emirate's shadow.",r/afghanconflict,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOVU5cXk4M2JUZzlQVWxEZXhUSTY5X2J5bVpnNG1VelkxWFgwd1k3bm53eGdRaU96Vl9YWGJ4YWVhTWdvZEZjVzdyLXhjMUdjNFRFQ3RSejNySnduYWc9PQ==

"Interestingly Pakistani 'analyst' page The Khorasan Diary only mentioned three deaths for the first group of soldiers killed and ignored the second soldier, Naik Saeed, who was killed in Datta Khel entirely.

"Okay, yes. You are correct. Didn't think of that example since it was before the Soviet War, but still true.

At the same time, I'd argue that was before Pakistan concocted the formula of backing the craziest Islamists they could as a hope to salt the earth against Indian influence.

Sure, the emirate's obstinence in cracking down on TTP on its side of the border may be the occasion for the ISI to reevaluate this decades' long strategy. All the same, this wouldn't just be a tweak in policy, but the shuttering of an entire directorate and numerous careers spent maintaining ties with the Taliban.

Owing to that, could be a chance that, even if pro-Taliban personalities didn't originate this outreach as a sting operation, they may lobby to co-opt it as such to betray the NRF/AFF, or even just be in position to leak intelligence to the emirate.
