Japan as a whole is up there as one of my favorite, if not all-time favorite country. But, I rank Misawa as one of worst overseas long locations. All other Japan bases in all branches, I'd rate a 9 or 10. Misawa would be about a 3 because it's below average in 80% of aspects on what makes a location great.

You're at Osan. You can easily visit Japan cheap and easy...and even free. Actually, you can visit Misawa EXTREMELY easy on the rotator. But you'd have to wait a week to come back.

I highly recommend to visit Yokota and Misawa. You and everyone else would know what I'm talking about it you spent a week in both.

I’ve been lucky enough to have had a chief who served on a board and reviewed my records prior to go to the board and he predicted my score and was right to the exact .5 point.

One of the two SrA wasn't able to test for SSgt so tenured out. The other was an older SSgt who got his stripe taken so dropped to SrA with too much time in service also tenured out.

I've seen it go one of two ways though usually. You follow the progression of discipline and it gets through or leadership doesn't want to escalate and let's them skate through.

"You've created a false dilemma by suggesting that we shouldn't encourage integrity unless everyone in the Air Force perfectly lives up to that standard. Those aren't mutually exclusive, in fact it would be meaningless to use integrity as a core value if we could be sure everyone would live by it. We don't use ""Don't commit murder"" as a core value, it's assumed that is already understood and largely not something anyone would consider doing. By highlighting integrity as a core value we are not only claiming that it is integral to how we want to be as a group, but also insinuating that it is something that is optional in daily life and requires effort to truly live by.

"You're describing the best possibly timeline. 

Here's a more realistic timeline for you. 

Get hired by a unit. 

Wait 2-4 months for a UPT slot

Go to UPT and get wings in about 12 months. (150 hours)

Go back to your unit and wait 2-4 months for your aircraft to have a school slot

Get trained in your airframe in about 3 months. (50-75 hours)

Go to your unit for seasoning and deployment prep. Lots of paperwork and random training before you're eligible for deployment. You also have to get into the deployment cycle. Most guard/reserve units are not continuously deployed, usually only once per year or two. (Average 25 hours per month if you're lucky)

Finally deploy for 90 days (max 330 hours per 90 days) 

That is probably about 3 years in total to get your first 600 hours or so. Then expect about 250-300 per year after that.",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbFVxM2hwZGQyc3BfRkxhYUVINE5GQVNuWHVTaHZwUTZzdlZlaXJDNEJMZ01uRUc0NERUSjN4QzZCZ2FzcU1GeURFMDVyZUNTX0J5R2w5U1J6RHJNaEE9PQ==

Also Ashley's diary was stolen against her will and shared against her will. She verified to the court that it was indeed her diary, but in that same letter:

[Ashley Biden wrote that others had ""once-grossly"" misinterpreted her ""once-private"" writings and thrown ""false accusations that defame my character and those of the people I love.""

Biden also said that her ""innermost thoughts"" recorded in the diary had been ""constantly distorted and manipulated,"" and assumed that the point of the theft was to ""peddle grotesque lies by distorting my stream-of-consciousness thoughts.""]

"Many of the actions to push the agenda and policies within the framework of project 2025 were taken by trump. At least 4 of his appointed secretaries in cabinet positions (and many more employees) are verified to be a part of the heritage foundation. The RNC policy director is also a Top 3 player in the foundation. The same man who played a huge part in all the media attention Trump got as he made his way into office.



This is a quote from Trump at a dinner sponsored by the heritage foundation in April 2022:

""This is a great group, and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.”

If trump isn't willfully involved, he may as well be working parallel with the heritage foundation, which I hope you would agree is just as bad.

"I agree. 

Exaggerating impact and including a dollar value that was clearly made up on the spot is exactly what is wrong with the culture behind awards.

"Predestination paradox,
  ""I replaced a power supply so it must of saved the mission"".  

 Say that a1c didnt show up to work,  What is the outcome? either way the 1 pc failed.   did it get fixed?  what position on the ops floor is down?  does that position matter? did 60 pc's fail? was any missions scheduled between the time it took to fix and the break?   You have no way of knowing what the future would of been had he not replaced the power supply.  its a PARADOX


The difference between the pilot clicking the button and a random computer on the ops floor is quite large.  if one didnt happen would the mission still have been completed?

maybe impacts arent good for EPB's


I also dont see how and half the force cannot understand that just because you had a possible effect on the mission with high visibility and regaurded that you deserve to be promoted. 


Say airmen replaces a keyboard on a ops floor that the shift key was a little sticky but in the same quarter that ops floor did fought off aliens perfectly and exterminated the entire population of them but the airmen was on leave for the entire month during the event.

in todays force that airmen would have a award winning narrative with some creative writing from a supervisor. you could say that keyboard saved the human race. 

does the airmen still deserve to beat out the radar tech that slaved 16 hr days for 1 month replacing a training radar components that is going to drmo?


saving the human race is better than drmoing a radar after fixing it.

"Expect to go over BAH after utilities unless you have roommates. Try and find a place somewhere off  the 215, plenty of nice communities out that way right off the highway and there’s 3 Targets within like 10 miles of each other. If you’ve never been out in this area before and are apartment shopping do some good research as almost everyone seems to claim “luxury” apartments and likes to highlight that the neighborhood is “gated”. 90% of all neighborhoods out here are gated including apartments places even in bad parts of town.  

Gate traffic can be hell some mornings if you’re on a standard dayshift but it’s not horrible. If off base i recommend EŌS fitness for a gym, one of the few places that don’t make you get into a contract and they’re not crazy expensive.

Side note: When shopping for housing. Many people will say “ don’t live off Craig road” or “ don’t live in North Las Vegas”. Don’t let that influence your choices that much especially the NLV comment. 

Craig road outside the gate is not the most desirable area at all and I don’t recommend it either but about 5 miles/15 min down the road there will be plenty of nice neighborhoods off of it with decent shopping around. Overall I still recommend all the suburbs and areas off the 215 getting into the Northwest part of town tho.

As for North Las Vegas. There is a huge difference in NLV that’s a little bit southwest of the base and NLV that’s all down the 215. Some people get told to avoid NLV and pass up on some great areas of town such as Aliante while they’re just shopping online because they see it has a NLV address. Theres no true bad options off the 215 but the farther down west you go there will be more amenities which also comes with more traffic (Decatur), all great areas tho.

"Army guy here. Are you an O grade or enlisted?

I’ve been stationed on a few AFBs in my 22 year career and have worked with the AF on a few joint assignments…your QoL is a huge myth that recruiters sell. The worst housing I’ve lived in since I’ve been in the Army was always on an AFB. The gyms aren’t better. The chow halls are the same. Your promotion advancement is far slower. My cousin had a two year head start on me in the AF…retired at E7…..I’m a W4 and get looked at for W5 in two years. 

So when we talk “better quality of life”, what does that even mean? You’re working for some dickhead, you’re still deploying, and if you’re not a grunt it’s all the same office work. To those who want to do something different, consider jumping over to the Army Warrant Officer ranks. The pay is better and you’ll have a voice at the table.  I worked with an AF Tech Sergeant who jumped over to go Warrant…he’s not disappointed.

retirement works differently in the guard, you do 20 and you retire, but you don't start collecting until you turn 60.  
  
rank also works differently, you fill a manning slot with an assigned rank, so if you are in a staff slot, you don't promote until you can move into a tech slot.  if there are no slots available, you don't advance.  
  
my career field was downsizing, so there were no advancement opportunities on the military or civilian sides.  i had crosstrained to get off the flightline, but since i held it as a secondary afsc, i kept getting thrown back in to fill out manning for deployments.  
  
the upsides for staying in were too little and too far away, and the benefits for punching out were obvious and immediate.  i spent my last two years trying to find a way to make it work, then i woke up one day and asked myself ""why am i even bothering?""  that's when i made the decision",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSEwyUDlFMWNrVGFVNEtFT2tjMmFfQW12cThNN2I4em9MV3NLT29ybU9YYzE3eFRMaDVkSjVPcDhyTEpvYWFORDJucVR3MTBPNGRUZUpNd292S2k0ZXc9PQ==

"As someone who has historically put a lot of stress on myself in the AF, I recognize the plight. The narrative of “if I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it well” kept me showing early and staying late at work, often lacking balance with my family.

As my kids got older, that lack of balance became obvious; I was not going to be able to be a kick-ass dad, and to continue to work at that pace.

Once I began to slow down (but still get my job done well!), I realized I just needed to learn to relax. The AF wasn’t depending on me for success. It would be juuuust fine, and I actually found some more space and room to think/allow things to progress made me better in some ways.

All that to say, I see you’re a fast burner, and that’s a good thing. But take a minute to decide what means the most to you. If it’s work, keep on keeping on. If it’s family, then don’t stress about making them a priority. They deserve it, and you deserve to be happy.

"Theres quite a few people who share your thought process like described in your post.


God transcends the material/physical world, so the kind of proof you are referring to isnt possible.  However the evidence of God is in quite literally everything.


The fine tuning of the universe, the complexity of DNA, the natural laws that the universe operates under, sub/atomic  complexity, consciousness...these are all things that point to intelligent design.  Something cant come from nothing, so even the big bang itself is evidence of God.


Look at Israel.  Its been the most hated group of people in history. For thousands of years they have been fought against, taken captive, etc.  Then they were established as a nation again in the 40s. Today they are thriving in a part of the world where they realistically shouldnt be, and are surrounded by millioms/billions of people from a diametrically opposed belief set who actively work to kill them.  That in itself is nothing short of miraculous.


We also have plenty of evidence in recorded history of Jesus being the son of God, but that conversation is for another time.

"I'm not stationed there but I lived all around Vegas for 11 years. There's a college nearby, CSN - College of southern Nevada - Cheyenne campus about 15min from base. If you're interested in electronics (radar, avionics, slot machine etc) IT, cyber security, criminology they got really good programs there too. I used to be in a cyber security club where we would often get meetings with FBI agents, famous hackers, CIA etc or they would give classes on hacking programs and such.
There's also UNLV for 4 year college downtown.

Near Nellis there is a 24 hour AutoZone. I know it's kinda random but if you like fixing cars for fun keep that in mind, theres another one downtown as well.

The area near Nellis is pretty bad, a lot of poverty and crime. But if you go super north, I think it's called centennial there's barely any homelessness or gang activity, gated communities and new superstores. 
Downtown is dangerous and expensive.
They have a shooting range you can try big guns and even drive tanks over vehicles.
Vegas is a good place if you like to drink and party, just be careful with bad influence that will try to take you to drugs. And don't waste all of your money gambling. All casinos are honestly the same
There's a few parks you can go, my favorite is MT. Charleston.
A good place to watch new years eve is at the RiO casino, at the top restaurant, they also have a Penn & Teller show (comedy/magic) and a Zipline.

Another pro tip is the RiO has free parking, compared to other casinos and is a block away from the strip.

"Ok, check it out. They just got picked up, which means they haven't done the job yet, means they also don't know what it's like. Good for them. I hope they love it.
You were talking in another comment about how there are so many hoops to jump through to get to another unit/mission. Those are there by design to weed out the people who don't have the grit to persevere and jump through the hoops to get where they want to go. If you want it, jump through the hoops.
It's your attitude that is toxic, and maybe that's because your bad leadership has been poisoning you. Another commenter spoke with you and thinks you're in a shitty unit, which does suck. If your leadership where you are located sucks, you could work on finding a mentor who does your same job and is higher in rank. A TSgt or higher would be great. This person can help you out with a records review to advise you on how you compare to your peers objectively. One of the best Chiefs I ever had did this for me, and he let me know I wasn't as cool as I thought I was. This allowed me to reassess what I was doing and focus my energy on tasks and initiatives that would actually set me apart so I could be competitive to get what I wanted. 
If you can't get to your dream unit right now, maybe just a different unit would be a good move so that you can get some local leadership that will advocate for you and help you get what you want. 
If you humble yourself and seek out help from someone doing the job you want who has some more experience than you do, you can probably make some progress toward doing the stuff you want to do without having to go over to the Army and be treated like shit. If you keep that attitude of how you're so much better than all the 1Ns around you, you're going to have a hard time finding the mentor who will want to give you the guidance and advice you want and need.",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUjJCMTNDcUF2NUVKMDNoU0loNWhfOHUtRk11b2ZSZ1g1NWx5b1pkbGZ1cUZwMFNxN1kySE9YdkJsQnN2T3dJelZSMktseXJPWnZyZVZYbXFpaVVwQU1GXzR1MENybndnYjRHLWtzSnNkMHc9

"Some good recommendations here, but what you must do is follow the assignment cycles, view the available assignments and apply for those assignments(depending on your career field ams/vmpf or MyVector/talent market place).  This will keep you listing the most current assignment on the top of your list.  

Additionally you need to periodically check the list of equal plus jobs.  You can only have one application in for this at a time so make sure to follow dates closely.  Some less known info on these is that you can apply for certain other career fields as well (postal, courier, academy instructor).  Check frequently as these aren't on the same standard cycle.

Another option is to engage with your supervisory chain about a DSD assignment.  These are special duties (recruiter, MTI, MTL...).  They will have certain pre requisites and require your supervisions support.

Final thought, I see a lot of concern on here about bad supervision, and I see it in the field as well, but everywhere I have been I have seen at least one decent person in the leadership team.  Know that they are open to trying to help you, you just have to communicate a need for help.

"It’d be more EO than IG, but the issue is unless it’s explicitly, it’s very hard to pin down.

Leadership having a general negative perception of you and that having an impact can be far more difficult to actually “prove” than it might seem. As shitty as it is. And it’s a huge reason why I think this archaic stance against beards is so ridiculous.

If someone truly believes beards are unprofessional, when they see someone like me with a waiver, there’s no way they suddenly think “but he’s fine.” If you actually think it’s unprofessional, I don’t believe me having a waiver stops those people from still viewing me or others with waivers negatively.

"Coming up on 1 year in recruiting. I'm in the suburbs of a major city in Ohio. When I first started I was super eager and worked a ton. After a few months I got the hang of it and really found out who to prioritize and who to put on the back burner. For me the work life balance has been better because in my primary AFSC I was constantly deployed/TDY and working rotating shifts. I am very fortunate though because MEPS is 20 minutes from my office and my furthest school is only 25 minutes away. Logistically I hit the jackpot, other recruiters are not so lucky. It's not a walk in market so I've really invested in my schools and live on referrals. 

No crazy stories in my first year but I have yet to put a single female in the air force. I have sent a ton of females up to MEPS but they have all been DQ'd medically and their waivers denied. 

If you are self motivated and can work without someone checking up on you, recruiting is a good gig. If you are the type of person that relies on coworkers, recruiting will not be a good gig for you.

"I agree that you can make the most out of every assignment based on what you do. HOWEVER comma I have a different spin on the phrase, from the perspective and experience of an army company-grade officer:

The assignments you get are the ones you fight for. I’m an army 1LT at an Air Force base attached to a three star command. That is an experience that I only know two other army LTs have had the opportunity to take part of. This has gotten me multiple development opportunities to set me apart from peers.

It does suck because my first year here I had no friends as even captains were few and far between. There were no other army LTs to hang out with. But being able to hop in a training exercise with security forces introduced me to other Air Force LTs and since then I’ve been in good company and have learned a lot about the Air Force and their operations considerations and planning through casual hang outs.

Now I’m in the running for a joint SOC assignment (in a support role of course I’m not THAT high speed) just because I responded to an email if anyone was interested in the job. Not many people responded.

I guess all that to say, you gotta make assignments that you can make the most out of.",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ0xuaWZsWDltTkZXN1hlU2ZVWmZIemRDOS13aHBqZWFZRU1hREhBeEtEUjFpdkYtVHNuYnNqR1lsQS1ZRVprbENjcU00SkViaDFsYWxXWUVvNEZFU0E9PQ==

"I used to be a firm believer but after my previous assignment it turned into at least 70/30.

There are voting guides out there to help you if you align with either party and how far you lean in each way (Repub., Dem., progressive leaning Dem, Libertarian, etc.)

Take stock of your values, interests, and goals (you will take this uniform for good one day) and see which candidate aligns with that the most. Not everything a person stands for is gonna be something you agree with. Look for the best fit.

Finally. You are better off building up some experience before going for your graduate degree.

"+1 for u/Twisky's comment about getting the full record from the archives.

But in the meantime, I don't see that anyone has really broken down what the uniform can tell you about him.

Ribbons, from top-left to bottom right:

* [American Defense Service Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Defense_Service_Medal)
* [Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic%E2%80%93Pacific_Campaign_Medal) with one Campaign Star
   * I can't determine the color of the star, but most likely bronze (for one campaign)
* The one under the lapel is probably the [World War II Victory Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_Victory_Medal)
* [National Defense Service Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Service_Medal)
* [Air Force Longevity Service Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_and_Space_Longevity_Service_Award) (maybe with a device on it)
* Next one is most likely:
   * [Philippine Defense Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Defense_Medal) (supported by the presence of the last one)
* [Philippine Liberation Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Liberation_Medal)
* [Philippine Independence Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Independence_Medal)

The cut of the uniform, plus the presence of several of those awards, puts this picture in the mid-1950s.

* US with circle says he was enlisted, not officer.
* [Blue #84 Service dress ](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/25/2002506135/-1/-1/1/WAID%20-%20LOOKBACK_TRANSITION%20PERIOD.PDF)with 4-pockets (you can tell by the distinctive cut of the pocket flap) was first issued in 1949.

"Assuming I got the above correct, we can state a few things about your Gramps:

   * If the star on the Pacific Campaign medal is Silver, then 5 Campaigns; if gold then 10 (there are 16 possible campaigns)
* He was in the Philippine at some point between 17 Oct 1944 and 2 Sept 1945
* He was an Infantryman, assigned to an infantry unit, and engaged in combat at least once
* He was NOT on occupation duty in Japan between 2 Sept 1945 and 27 Apr 1952

I've been at assignments where leadership outright refuses to send Amn to career field required training, refuses to allow people to compete for awards, refuses PCAs, refuses TDYs and refuses training (even free training offered by the base). 

In assignments like that, it's tough to say, ""It is what you make it,"" because the command is making decisions that have impacts on the rest of your career. So it doesn't matter how much valuable work I do; if my leadership refuses a PCS Dec, that will be brought up in future promotion boards.

"Cannon AFB Alumni here.  TLDR:  I had possibly the best time of my career at Cannon, and some of the worst experiences at Hurlburt Field and one base is objectively better than the other.

Location is rough.  It's gotten better, but it's still remote.  That being said, both tours were very different.  In the first rodeo, front half was absolutely horrible.  Officers and Senior Enlisted burning their airmen out, grinding them up to get the numbers needed so they could promote.  Several suicides happened, a few commanders were quietly dismissed.  The Intel squadron was absolutely toxic until we got this C-130 navigator commander who tried to help.  He did some good work, got some bad players removed.  But then we got a new batch of Captains and MSgts and they turned the whole unit around; they removed the toxic players and actually gave a hoot.  Those Captains (most are Majors and LtCols now) are possibly the best officers that I have even had to work for.

Second half of my tour was easily the best of my career.  Mission at Cannon in 2016-2018 was phenomenal, and the squadron was like being in a warm family.  Great deployments, great TDY's, the civilians assigned to the 56 were awesome, and leadership seemed to genuinely care about your success (we don't talk about the E9 who settled into the SEL position in 2018).  Despite the bad location, I would have stayed for another 4-years on that experience.

Let's contrast that with Hurlburt Field.  Great location, great access to amenities and healthcare.  Terrible work environment, terrible focus on the mission, and so much politics that you can't scratch your tookus in public without being called out by EO.  Lazy units, and the politics... they would rather push things onto the 27 SOW so as not to risk looking silly in front of AFSOC HQ.  No amount of resting my weary body in the Gulf could undo the sheer toxicity of the 11th there.

"There is certainly something to it. My personality, a negative work environment will weigh on me more and more after a while no matter what the area is like. I loved where I was stationed in Germany but I was absolutely miserable (full disclosure, I had a lapse of sanity and went AF to Army, which turned out to be a bad idea regardless of how hooah I was). It really had me depressed and I didn’t enjoy as much of Germany and Europe as I should have. I almost find shittier bases/locations (that it’s collectively agreed upon it is) can make for a better experience as some try to make up for it. Of course it just takes one person somewhere up the chain to ruin it, but the potential is there. But it really comes down to your own ability to “make the best of it”. I can’t fake it or lie to myself about realities, but some can. I can keep it inside for the most part so it doesn’t become a toxic virus that spreads around the work center and makes it mentally worse for everyone, but I try to make it as fun as possible for my and others’ sake. Laughing through tragedy might not be the most healthy thing, but it’s kept me from Ctrl+Alt+Deleting my way out, and you could argue that’s the most important thing. 

There’s always something positive that can be found and experienced even at the worst assignment. It certainly may not feel like it at the time, but reflecting back, it’s at least a character building experience. I’ve had several experiences in my military career that it was the last straw, and I was done and getting out. Like we’re talking to the point I was about to ruin my career and make someone cry that you definitely shouldn’t do, and I didn’t care, especially at the point in my career and rank. But I got through and even can laugh about the experience on the other side. One, I even trauma bonded with the team I was in charge of and stayed in contact even though we all are all over the place now. And some of it were holy shit moments, “we did that!” We overlooked some of the cool shit that was happening because of the dumpster fire we were in simultaneously. Hard to experience when you do something that might be a bit more boring and mild mannered, but sometimes that might mean you need to apply for something that could shake things up. I’ve been in a while, and there’s nothing that wasn’t apart of a bigger assignment that there wasn’t something cool or fun or worthwhile out of it, even if my feelings were “fuck this place” or “fuck that unit” at the time (and maybe a little to this day).

"Personally, I didn’t want to find love in my own culture. I’m from an area that wasn’t diverse and it led me to find white women boring and unattractive. I grew up in a sea of mayonnaise colored women with thin lips and stringy hair. 

I joined the military and intentionally chose to date outside of my race and culture because that is what I found attractive and eventually marrying a minority woman. 

The food, cultural celebrations, knowledge, understandings and exposure to her culture has been mind blowing! Had I married Becky from my home town I’d likely have “live, laugh, love” all over my house with stupid signs that say “eat” hung above the pantry.

When I was going through HAZMAT, it happened to be at the same time they were dishing out a weeks worth of mass punishment because of a DUI or something some shithead did.

"Just keep going. Eventually you’ll get somebody that cares. I’ve had mine renewed by like 4 of the 7 doctors I’ve seen. 

Below is my sob story but bottom line is that each doctor has their own idea of what should be waiverable. 
Their own beliefs, prejudices, moods, leadership pressure, training etc varies significantly. Some doctors still only give them out to certain races, some don’t give them out at all, some give them out like candy.

If you truly believe you need one just keep trying and ask for a new doctor if you need it. Google pictures of mild to severe PFB for your race/ethnicity to see if they align with your symptoms before having it checked professionally

My story is that I had the exact same symptoms presenting the exact same way each time, but the doctors all had different reactions. 

One said short term to start because that’s “the policy at this base” 

One said “you don’t need a waiver, it’s ridiculous that you had one before. Do you know who gave it to you last time?” 

One said “it’s obvious you need one but you’re only getting a 1 year not a 5 like everybody else” 

One said “you have a weird history so I’m only giving you a short term (only 2 months” 

One said my goodness why’d you have to go through all that and gave me the 5 instantly. 

I’m positive my symptoms were the same every single time because I always took pictures prior to appointments. But yeah mileage varies heavily.",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnbndwZ2pUWjVIejRPdVBWTUdPaHBNUVV3YTZwVzE3RTZIcklRdGVmeFJITl9UR2FuREVMMXB3c3hCVGIyS2hEQWRSa2JwN28yY3JCTlc5R3RZZmdZOU9XbHlJSlZySE1Yb09nbVJBZFRkUVU9

"I’d look into the ten year rule. I believe if you retire as an officer, then you’ll need to have been an officer for 10 years of active duty. That’s the rule for 20+ years active. 

I think high 3 will always match the base pay updates to modern times.

Maybe reserves personnel don’t even need to be an officer for ten years to retire as one. I have no clue in all honesty",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNXBjbHdaSWozQ3NELW5xT3g2T3hhTW5fU3BlZU9mN1hxeks0NHhvT0tKN0haUE9Mbzk2RFpRb1FvODA5cHk5UGV1YTdxY3ZSelF5eXpzZ05CMXdsb2NHZmlrWTJYNjRibHpfLWhDdC1fQ1k9

"Did you read the retirements AFI?

It’s in the retirement reg, AFI 36-3203:

And then under note 8 of Table 8.1:

8. Officers who resign officer commissions and retire in enlisted status will have retired pay calculated in accordance with 10 USC § 1407e. (T-0). DFAS is required to calculate the high- 36 month average as if the member held the retired grade for the last 36 months of active service.

TLDR enlisted high 3",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWkIwYkJJVzJRZEVzbVY2akpENS1vSUFFZkxZQzhlUFFGcmxpTllNTTA0NWxXSTdrdlBLdjEwYm9MdWc2aFNJQjNuaFA0M3BTNE1GU016RGF6TGVMa1E9PQ==
"You won’t get an officer retirement if you have less than 10 years of commissioned officer service.  

 You have two choices with a reserve retirement. You can be discharged when you choose to retire or you can choose to transfer to the Retired Reserve.   

In the first case, your retired pay base is the average of your personal 36 highest months of pay. There is no inflation adjustment or using the current pay chart for previous years. If you have selected Reserve service, they will use the rate you would have gotten on active duty.  

 If you do the second, your retirement pay base is based on the highest potential pay prior to actually starting your retirement pension at age 60 (or earlier if you qualify). You also continue accruing TIS. So yours would be based on what the active duty pay charts give for average highest 36 months of E-6 (or E-7) pay right before you get your pension. 

There’s a nice illustration in Chapter 6 of https://www.usar.army.mil/Portals/98/Documents/Retirement/USAR%20Retirement%20Planning%20Guide%202024%20Web.pdf?ver=FPvVvvpjj99RsGxGsfxpRA%3d%3d",r/airforce,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM01DUU9hUHM5QmtIaG1CdjJtMmdtWXc2VHpoLUZxQnI0MXFhUzVCbUlnZDFfbXRqb2dDdVJycnpQaTVENV91c1lGYlRQSWZqdW81MkFnUm4zYnRDNmc9PQ==
