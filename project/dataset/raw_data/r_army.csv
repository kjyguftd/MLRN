">To my understanding, 17Es often get put thrown in with cavalry scouts when doing reconnaissance and general scout missions,

We do. But it's not as glorious and fun as it sounds. At least at my unit, we essentially just bum a ride to their OP and break off to do our own shit close by. We also might have a habit of running the fuck away once contact happens but that's essentially what our Cavs told us to do.

Don't take anything besides what you want. 17E is desperate for people. It'll probably only be a couple of weeks before it opens up if it isn't open already. Make sure to get good ASVAB scores also as the requirements are decently high.

Hello all, I am curious about enlistment, I had made quite a few mistakes in my past but they are in my past.

"This may be true but at a certain point you are a Soldier, you are given benefits (even from one contract) that many people would do anything for. The least you can do is maintain a (albeit very low) physical standard. HT/WT is a pretty outdated metric for physical fitness, but if you’re consistently getting a 400 on ACFT and failing HT/WT, you are out of a shape. 

When it comes to actually failing ACFTs, maybe I’m an asshole but I think Soldiers should be kicked out more aggressively for ACFT failure. 360 is the absolute bare minimum and if you workout for like an hour once a week you can pass the ACFT. (I’m not talking about failures because someone tried to deadlift 340 and fucked the form up, but their overall score was like 500 without the deadlift failure). 

The bare minimum standard is so achievable, that Soldiers have no excuse to consistently fail (besides laziness).",r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZVFzOEU0b1M2TEoxekRpbHVjeDlUVzl0bDFQY3RjZFVGVklnYXJIQkwtMGxoeF8zT1BTcjVnYkJPWkpWOFhILVFtVUZKRFFiRHhNUnYtazdXOFh2Vnc9PQ==
"I can get that sentiment with regard to the ACFT, but with regard to H/W, I’d frankly disagree.

Unless the soldiers blatantly fat enough to make comparisons to the Michelin Man, I’m not going to care if somebody’s ten pounds over the max weight limit or is a few percent over the max body fat percentage, especially if they can pass an ACFT with scores that aren’t just barely skating by. Considering the careerists in the military seem to enjoy going overboard with treating anybody that can’t meet a certain weight range/body measure like shit (arguably the folks that come in underweight get treated even worse than the overweight folks for god knows what reason), even if they are also sometimes guilty of it, makes me think the sole purpose of the H/W portion of testing is to make sure soldiers “look fit” and not actually be fit.

But on the other hand if you enlist with an 18X contract and washout, well you don't have a backup plan built in like Opt 40 does. You'll be assigned a new MOS and probably have a very short ""needs of the Army"" list to choose from, if they even let you choose. Expect the shittiest jobs in the Army that nobody wants to enlist for, because those are the ones the Army needs bodies for the most.

Unless you're a superhuman and know 100% off the bat that you will pass Special Forces Selection, you're better off enlisting with Opt 40 and then contacting an in-service SORB recruiter to get the ball rolling on sending a packet to apply for selection.

1. Hurt but don't seek medical care. They have severe shin splints or joint issues but 'suck it up' anyway. HT/WT failures also fall into this group.

2. Their unit doesn't do organized PT so they don't have a minimum level of fitness. I'm talking to you Group Support and SOAR. 

3. Genetics. The SPT hates short people. A lot of short females or males can not throw a ball. Throwing is an explosive movement and requires some amount of power. Running and Rucking 5x a week is not gonna help this

So let me explain budgets and how they work. Remember all those times you went to the range and they just shot all that ammo before leaving? Well it’s bc if they don’t use it they will get less next range. So if Unit A was spending all this money to actually deploy and now there are no deployments they can go on. Some Commanders feel the need to spend it on something else so they don’t lose the money next year.

"Not sure that place has changed much since I was last there in '91. Polk was a Mechanized Infantry Post \\[5th ID\\] while I was stationed there.

We would stay out in the field for several days during the summer, get filthy as hell. There was always something going on, one was always busy. The surrounding communities are of your typical GI town mentality.  Leesville just doesn't seem to want to improve in any way. The further you get away from the base, the better off you will be in terms of decent entertainment.  Alexandria is the next largest city nearby, about 45 minutes east.  Not much in that city when I was there. maybe a mall \\[if it's still there\\].  Beware of the Pentecostal church, of which runs Alexandria under the radar. Lake Charles isn't too bad either. It's the deep south.  Attitudes are different. Demographics are different. If you manage to get a 96, get yourself to New Orleans or Houston. Since the 5th ID has departed, JRTC now reigns there.

"So prior to leaving the aircraft.  
- Dropped static line, either your own or the person in front of you drops static line and safety can't get it to push up and away.  If around Arm, some sick riser burn on the arm or you look like Popeye as your biceps and such move to forearms.  Around  head, probably death or a sick scar.  

- Activation of Reserve and close to paratroopers door and reserve makes it to the door.  I've never seen this one, but if it somehow happens, hopefully everyone in front of that jumper, either jump or move to the tail of aircraft lest be padding for jumper exiting.  Realistically, you are going to get forcefully removed out of the aircraft and expeditiously.  Understand the parachute is gonna go the path of least resistance so bottom trail edge of door, and if you don't get out before then....so will you.  Except your body isn't pliable or malleable to squeeze between platform and skin of aircraft.  Probably going to hurt alot.  Potentially next thing could happen is listed below.

- You jump and either you hug reserve or activate reserve in the first 6 seconds of jumping.  T-11 Reserve is not made for the prop blast.  I have seen mains not pulled out of their deployment sleeve, because the reserve interfered with the opening sequence.  Additionally, the reserve would have damage done to the canopy.  That shouldn't be an issue, but could increase rate of descent.  

- Towed Jumper.  You leave the aircraft, but really.  Your hanging outside as Loadies and JMs try to figure what to do with you.  One idea is to cut your static line and then you count to 6 and activate reserve.  Ensure you cover your rip cord handle, reserve activates and your gonna have a worse problem.  Hopefully, Loadies don't mess up the winch.  Some guy in Alaska was dangling outside the aircraft for a while because the loadies messed up.  

- Any issues with your parachute.  I.e. Total or Partial malfunctions.  Total malfunction, no lift capability.  Partial some lift.  

-  Had a buddy flip upside down and risers caught his leg and fucked it up.  Bad enough to get med boarded. 

- Collisions and entanglements, you decide to make a friend in the air and you either pads through risers or suspension lines (never seen that happen) or either you or someone goes through the corner vent of the T-11.  Now you get to land together.  

Hopefully no one jettisons their equipment over your chute and head.  

Sorry got tired of typing near the end. It's late where I am at.  Honestly, their is a change shit can happen, but it is rare for more of the catastrophic events.  

I did forget, the Emergency door near the propellers could blow open.  Happened twice while I was an Airborne Instructor.  Was not on the aircraft, but saw videos of it from a couple buddies.  Not gonna kill you, but may scare the hell out of you or make you either to get the hell out of the aircraft.",r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeUgwYXl1VU1iRXFNRmlQSWtXUnpaQlhvSF9YNzF1eXY0UFQ4eEdEemZjbnN0d2Z4YnlFNHZ3aldUakZhMTFEQ2ppa3NlNFJmM18wS0lHMUpBbWdBckE9PQ==

"That’s absolutely not true. There are plenty of E-4s that have retired after 20yrs. However they’re not the ones who are “highlighted” cause the perception (IMHO, correctly) is that if you don’t make it to a certain rank by a certain time, you’re probably a sh!+bag. No one is forced to be a leader. And one if the biggest lies that is promulgated is that when civilians hire a former military member, it’s that they’re hiring someone who’s a leader. Working in the civilian sector now for the last 16yrs, I’ve realized that those that boast the most about their military time, are the ones who have forgotten the discipline and integrity that the military promotes.

Something to keep in mind that some places are still oil heated, think diesel heater, for both water and heat, and you will be responsible for keep it full, now most places will run a full winter on a single fill up, might take two, my place did one just fine, but if it is empty when you rent it it will be a big bill to get it filled, iirc mine was around 1k euro to fill, but you can use a taxform on it and save like 20%.

"Based on your response, you haven't tried.

So... As a uniball thanks likely to burn pits and having done a simple T test which shows Righty is a damn champion taking on Lefty's work load (pun intended), You explain to your PCM you're having symptoms of low T and wish to get tested and/or referred to a urologist. Your PCM is likely not going to refer you for the lab without urology consultations. 

Urology will then ask again about your symptoms, likely discuss specifics of sexual performance and exercise experiences/energy levels. They're going to hound you about diet and sleep as well. This will likely require a couple appointments - ymmv but usually they don't just order the lab after a single visit. 

you'll perceive this as trash while the urologist will ask you to track performance, sleep and diet before pushing to get labs. This is because Joe will often thinks it's fun to get T or the little blue pill when it's not needed... So Army docs tend to be hesitant in just giving tests and meds in this area until they rule out lifestyle.

I did, I had to tell the cashier what had happened. He  was cool about it and thanked me for it, but that cop called me the next day and gave me a lecture, I had to take it cause I knew it was wrong but I did pay for it so no harm no foul, but he was talking about how I could go to jail for a 25 cent water bottle.",r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdEhXLU9Dem1IYUJrdE1VWnRONERUeWJCVG9ZcXhjblZGbURCaF8zRW9UQXhyZmd5VURVcFRNelFuVEJDcUQtRHY1ZnpKcjlEdTJkUVh3OWZTLXkxVFE9PQ==

Was the item a pair of headphones, or was it milk. 

I'm *not* saying any scenario is better than the other, I'm just saying you are going to have to counsel them and it should be based on what happened. It should read differently if it's ""you put a pair of headphones in your pocket"" vs ""you tried to steal eggs and milk to feed your kids"". Again, neither of them are right, but with one of them you can at least put things in the counseling like ""moving forward we will set up a budgeting class"" or something.

"School teachers sign employment contracts for one school year at a time. The teacher has to want to work for the school again, and the district has to want them back.   
  
In April 2024, my administration emailed a survey asking who planned to return for the 24-25 SY. The District collected the responses and generated the contracts. Returning teachers were given a few weeks in May to review their offer and request changes before signing and returning the contract for the school board to approve. My 24-25 contract shows my contract dates, salary, and any other requirements from either party (for example, I must maintain a Class B CDL with school bus and passenger endorsement). 

Most teachers in a traditional, nine-month school year are on nine-month contracts. Outside of those nine months, they're not on contract and don't make a salary. JROTC instructors are on 10 or 11-month contracts because we have stuff to do before and after the school year when the students aren't there. You can ask the school to hire you on a 12-month contract, but the Army will only cost-share your salary up through an 11-month contract. I'm on an 11-month contract, and I ask for my 11 months of salary to be disbursed over 12 calendar months.

"First off, air-tight counseling, air tight being the operative word here. Don't put anything to paper that TDS can pick apart. Counsel them, list who stole, where they stole, what they stole, and when they stole it. List each regulation they broke. Let them know they may be recommended for an article 15 due to this event.

Impose no further punishment (IE smoking). TDS can say the soldiers already received corrective action if you do. 

Inform the soldiers on what's to come. First, they'll be given a reading, stating whether or not they've been recommended for article 15, where they SHOULD be informed of their rights, however, you can inform them of their rights during said counseling just in case.
 
Next they'll be contacted by legal counsel and should draft a statement, then revisions will be recommended by their counsel, which they should listen to.

Next, they wait until the hearing, once it comes, they stand before an article 15 ""board."" At the end, they can choose to appeal via court martial. Considering the PX is REALLY good when it comes to evidence, I wouldnt suggest they take that route. 

Figure out why they stole, seriously, get to the bottom of it. Not just the ""I dunno sarn' I jus wasn't thinkin' "" bullshit. 

Then, if you for some reason, want to save their asses try to get every leader in their CoC to right letters of good character, however the commander amd the 1SG cannot right those( due to conflict). This may help them get a reduced punishment. 

For now, tell the soldiers they fucked up, and due so calmly amd professionally. The worst kind of trouble you can be in when it comes to the army, is the trouble you don't get yelled at for. Let them stew in it. Hopefully the time between now and the decision of the Article board will be more of a punishment (mentally) them the actual punishment.

She loaded a mag on the command, and waited for everyone to start firing. She rolled over on her side, looked at me, flagged me, and said ""I could do it."" Before I even thought to duck out of the way or scream for help, three drill sergeants laid hands on her. I got the hell outta their way. 

She was escorted away, and we never saw her again. The drills were nicer to me for a few days afterward. 

I always wonder if everyone else was too hard on her, or if she just wasn't meant for the pressure. English was her second language, so I wonder if that caused some issues. To this day I'm very adamant about range safety. I've also never told my husband, because I know he'd lose his shit.

Edit: just incase anyone is wondering why we were paired. Trainees who had already grouped and zeroed were acting as ""coaches"" to people who hadn't yet.

"Gunnery will be similar to the D Co tables if you’ve ever been weapons company. RWS is just like CROW if you ever used while deployed. But you’ll have time to study up for gunnery whenever that comes. Biggest thing is to crack open the TM and learn how to actually PMCS your vehicle. Get in good with your mechanics so they fix your stuff right away, bonus points if you’re an NCO and you find time for you and your Soldiers to help in the repair bay. Your stuff gets fixed faster when your Soldier is handing tools to your mechanic so he can keep working. 

As far as Infantry stuff - it’s the same man. Standard rifle and weapon squads, plus a driver and gunner/TC that stays in the vehicle. Make sure your Stryker crew still does some infantry things, and make sure you have alternate drivers and one or two gunners, if training resources allow. 

Biggest TTP is planning that dismount point. It’s not a tank, so avoid all direct fire when trying to dismount. However, don’t do the super mega light infantry thing of dismounting 10km away. Try to find the last covered and concealed spot that will also allow you to maneuver your Strykers after you’re in contact. On offense, you usually open with your weapons squad then bring your Strykers up to an alternate or secondary SBF position (unless AT threat is too high). On the defense, you’ll open with your Strykers doing berm drills, along with your dismounted javelins (mounted javelins too).",r/army,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhLU5CQ1VacWRDVHAwQ1dNRnlVOVNTREZMTy1QYlZZX3VFX3Fhamc3cmZNN1RBOUcyR0U0R2ZmMEljcGFFSEFlX1VPak13OTZUTkVzZElTS2R0TURCRUE9PQ==

Are they bored? Do they come from an environment where stealing isn’t that frowned upon? Is this something that more than just these two soldiers are doing? 

A lot of people in the comments are saying article 15 etc etc. I think we tend to forget that as leaders we have an obligation to both discipline but also to educate and mentor. We want to create forward thinking, integral soldiers who enjoy being in the Army not just peons who fear the boot and get up to no good anytime someone isn’t looking. 

I think counseling and understanding is a first step. Then move on to keeping these soldiers gainfully employed, take them under your wing, put them into details that will teach them something, put them in charge of teaching other soldiers.

"If you have an option, get the surgery BEFORE you get out. That will be more beneficial to you. If you go to the VA after you get out, it may be a long wait depending on where you go. Also, get hard copies of ALL your medical records. This will benefit you when you file a claim for VA disability.

Plus, if you have an option to receive a medical board, and be medically retired, that is even better for you. You will receive a pension and still be able to file for a VA disability rating.

Remember, even if you claim something and get a zero (0%) percent rating, it still indicates that it was service related.
