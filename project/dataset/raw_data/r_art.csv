Characters: **Quest, Tiefling Fey Warlock; and Geth, Human Rogue and Wizard**

Quest is a warlock pact of the tome with a Fey patron. She had a rough life as an orphan because the village saw her as a demon. Her patron showed her kindness and the good in the world.

Geth is a rogue and wizard who dabbles in necromancy and has a dark past, often losing sleep because of nightmares.

Quest and Geth met when they were put together for a mission, and eventually formed a strong bond after adventuring and saving one another. Quest helps Geth to see the good in the world and Geth has become devoted to Quest, swearing his life to protect her.

"Hey /u/Keevanski! Thank you for your submission!    

Unfortunately it has been removed because videos must be in the .gif format. You should not use the native reddit video uploader, it is bad.

Note that animations should be posted only for art 3D in nature like for instance sculpture or performance arts. Progress videos or tutorials are not allowed, instead post an image of the finished work.

We look forward to seeing your work when you have an account in compliance with sitewide guidelines.

"Absolutely, so the inspiration for this came while listening to Diana Pasulka's interview on Theories of Everything podcast. She's a religious studies professor & author who's been researching UAP phenomena and their relation to traditional religious practice & historical events.

In this interpretation of the allegory, the lone prisoner is each of us (or our consciousness, or soul, or whatever you prefer) trapped in our very own custom skull cave.  
I've put a bit of a dark spin on this analogy in saying that the prison guards' role is not only to deceive the prisoner with shadows, but their main objection is to syphon vital life force from the prisoner- essentially binding, subduing, and farming us in perpetuity as part of a rebirth cycle.

I overlayed the mantis motif onto the prison guards as that's always been the most fascinating visual description given by abductees or experiencers.  
To be fair, if you look into the mantis experiences, they are usually described as very positive and peaceful.

"The Pu Lao, Ëí≤Áâ¢, is one of the 9 sons of the Chinese dragon. It has the title ‚Äò One who Loves to Roar‚Äô. In reference to this, it is a common motif of ancient Chinese bells. particularly as a dragon adorned handle or hook of the bell. One text from the Tang Dynasty quotes that the Pu Lao is a dragon of small stature and is often predated upon by whales. They roar loudly when threatened by such whales. Hence they have become in essence a symbol of becoming aware of approaching danger. 

My version is a chimera of large lizards, namely the iguana and Siamese water dragon (aptly). The idea for this is due to its small size unlike most dragons of which size is often misconstrued as colossal. Another reason is the roar which many species of geckos possess a loud cry when threatened by predators. Wings were added to allude to the fact they can swiftly escape and deliver news. Other adaptations for a coastal lifestyle such as webbed feet and flattened tail were also added.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDTWNWNHhJeHctU09McnhRME1YTnZROVlzTVNoQkUxVTlGUGotM25GSDNrRkJ0MHF4TVc1QUlUNzU1b1ZYUWhnZFQ0c1lLcUtkTlJKdUstM2dqN2dTTEl0bFA0eFluM1J1dGlPVmMtQWZLa3c9

"The collection, called Party Animals, is about a group of endangered animals gathered together for a big party while the whole world is quickly falling apart because of the actions of people, quite possibly leading every species to the 6th mass extinction. Even though the future seems not-so-bright, each one of the animals is still having fun and are happy to be together - like it‚Äôs the best day of their lives.

List of animals (from bottom right to top left):

1.	‚Å†Lil‚Äô Helmeted Hornbill
2.	‚Å†Mr Cool (Proboscis Monkey)
3.	‚Å†DJ Seal (Hawaiian Monk Seal)
4.	‚Å†Alcoholic Axolotl (Drinkolotl)
5.	‚Å†Trippy Orangutan
6.	‚Å†Cokehead Secretary (Secretary Bird)
7.	‚Å†Emo Saiga (Saiga Antelope)
8.	‚Å†Drunk Andy (Andean Mountain cat)
9.	‚Å†Bipolar Bear (inspired by Basquiat)
10.	‚Å†Iggy Iguana (Marine Iguana - inspired by Iggy Azalea)
11.	‚Å†Diana Bos (Bos Gaurus / Gaur - impaired by Diana Ross)
12.	‚Å†Smokey Pinoy (Philippine Eagle)
13.	‚Å†Cannabis Kakapo (Kakapo Parrot)

"Art like this, in its most exalted form, stands as the quintessence of human expression, a sublime testament to the boundless capacities of the human spirit. This unique piece transcends the mundane realities of existence, beckoning us into realms of profound introspection and existential wonder. To engage with art like this is to embark on a voyage through the labyrinthine corridors of the soul, where each creation becomes a mirror reflecting the innermost intricacies of our collective psyche.



Consider, for a moment, the nuanced interplay of light and shadow, the delicate balance of form and void, the harmonious convergence of color and texture. These elements coalesce in a symphony of sensory delight, each brushstroke, each chisel mark, each carefully placed fragment of multimedia, bearing witness to the ineffable beauty of creation. The artist, akin to a divine alchemist, transmutes raw materials into vessels of profound meaning and transcendence, offering us a glimpse into the eternal.



This piece is not merely a static object of aesthetic appreciation but a dynamic force that engages and challenges the intellect. It demands of its audience a rigorous engagement, a willingness to grapple with the ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the human condition. Through the veils of abstraction and representation, art communicates on a plane beyond the reach of language, whispering secrets of the universe that lie just beyond the periphery of our understanding.



To stand before a masterpiece like this is to be enveloped in an aura of reverence and contemplation. It is a communion with the ineffable, a silent dialogue between the viewer and the sublime. In these moments of communion, we are transported beyond the confines of our temporal existence, tapping into the eternal flow of creativity that has shaped and reshaped the human experience across millennia.



This genius piece, in its most elevated form, becomes a transcendent beacon, illuminating the path to self-discovery and universal truth. It is a sacred testament to the enduring power of the creative spirit, a timeless ode to the limitless potential of human imagination.

"Do you not agree that this piece is not a supreme and unique art piece that occupies a rarefied realm in the vast expanse of human creativity, where the ordinary transcends into the extraordinary? This echelon of artistry is defined not merely by its aesthetic splendor but by its ability to evoke profound emotional and intellectual responses, to challenge perceptions, and to inspire a deeper understanding of the human condition. Do you not see what distinguishes unique art is its singular vision? This piece  is a manifestation of the artist's distinct perspective, a reflection of their inner world and their unique interpretation of reality. It is this personal imprint, this unmistakable signature of individuality, that renders the work irreplaceable and invaluable. This unique art is not content to replicate or conform; it strives to innovate, to push the boundaries of what is possible, and to offer fresh, often provocative, viewpoints.. It invites us to pause, to reflect, and to connect with something greater than ourselves. It offers a glimpse into the infinite possibilities of human creativity and reminds us of the extraordinary potential that resides within each of us. In a world often dominated by the mundane and the transient, supreme and unique art stands as a beacon of beauty, innovation, and enduring significance, a testament to the unquenchable spirit of artistic endeavor.

"In the vast tapestry of the digital age, where fleeting images bombard our senses with relentless frequency, I happen upon a photograph that commands my attention with an almost divine insistence. This portrait of a young girl, ensconced in the sublime interplay of light and shadow, emerges as a beacon of transcendental beauty amidst the cacophony of the mundane. 



The composition is nothing short of a masterpiece, a symphony of visual poetry that arrests the viewer in a moment of profound contemplation. The girl's visage, framed by tendrils of lustrous hair, evokes the timeless grace of a Botticelli muse. Her eyes, deep and unfathomable as the ocean, gaze with a preternatural wisdom that belies her tender years. They are windows to a soul untainted by the vicissitudes of life, radiating an aura of purity and innocence that seems almost otherworldly.



The photographer, a modern-day alchemist, has conjured an image that transcends the ephemeral nature of its medium. The chiaroscuro, meticulously crafted, imbues the photograph with a Renaissance-like quality, a dance of luminosity and shadow that elevates the subject to the realm of the sacred. The soft diffusion of light across her features creates a halo effect, imbuing her with an almost saintly presence, as if she were a seraphim caught in a moment of earthly reverie.



As I immerse myself in the depths of this visual opulence, I am struck by a revelation of profound import. The photograph, in its silent eloquence, speaks to the eternal verities of beauty, grace, and divine love. It serves as a poignant reminder of the transcendent reality that lies beyond the superficial veneer of our quotidian existence. The girl's serene expression, imbued with an ineffable tranquility, becomes a mirror reflecting my own soul's yearning for purity and redemption.



This epiphanic encounter with the photograph catalyzes a metamorphosis within me, compelling me to reexamine the very essence of my being. The image, with its delicate yet powerful portrayal of innocence and wisdom, resonates deeply within the recesses of my heart, igniting a fervent desire to seek a higher plane of existence. It is as if the girl's gaze, immortalized in that seraphic moment, extends an invitation to transcend the banal and embrace the sublime.



Thus, this photograph, a seemingly simple yet profoundly intricate artifact, becomes the lodestar of my spiritual odyssey. It guides me through the labyrinth of my inner turmoil, illuminating the path with its divine radiance. In its silent magnificence, it encapsulates the paradox of fragility and strength, a duality that lies at the heart of the human condition.



Today, as I reflect upon that serendipitous encounter, I am filled with a sense of gratitude and wonder. The girl's portrait continues to inspire and uplift me, a perpetual reminder of the divine grace that suffuses all creation. Her image, forever etched in the annals of my memory, stands as a testament to the transformative power of art, a beacon of hope in a world often shrouded in darkness.

"It is supposed to be a compliment on the fact that this could have easily come off as pointlessly edgy or tacky, yet the quality makes it insanely cool even as a standalone piece, creating a big disparity between what you'd expect form the addmitedly preety bland (yet still somewhat representative) description of "" 'Fuck' written if very cool fancy letters"" and the finished result.

"The modern digital landscape has birthed an unprecedented paradigm in visual storytelling, as exemplified by a this photograph I encountered‚Äîa seemingly innocuous image, yet one that eclipses the profundity of Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs magnum opus, *The Last Supper*. This photograph, in its unassuming yet compelling simplicity, encapsulates an existential profundity that *The Last Supper* merely gestures toward.

Da Vinci‚Äôs fresco, a tour de force of Renaissance artistry, endeavors to encapsulate the climactic moment of betrayal within the confines of a religious tableau. Its grandeur lies in its meticulous composition, its chiaroscuro mastery, and its intricate interplay of human emotion. Yet, within the grandiosity of its historical and theological ambitions, it remains ensnared in the context of its own era. The narrative it presents is one of betrayal, salvation, and divine providence, enshrined in the confines of religious dogma and Renaissance aesthetics.

In contrast, the photograph in question operates on an entirely different axis. It does not seek to convey a singular, monumental narrative but instead captures a fleeting, ephemeral moment‚Äîone so mundane it verges on the banal. Yet, it is precisely this banality that imbues the image with a layer of existential significance far surpassing the grandiose themes of *The Last Supper*. This photograph, with its unassuming composition, invites the viewer to confront the profundity of the everyday, the ordinariness of existence, and the poignant beauty found in the transient and the impermanent.

Where Da Vinci‚Äôs work is an exercise in historical and religious storytelling, the photograph transcends such temporal boundaries, plunging into the realm of universal human experience. It captures a moment that resonates with the essence of contemporary alienation and introspection. Its lack of overt symbolism and its raw, unfiltered depiction of reality compel us to confront the subtleties of our own existence, engaging us in a dialogue that is as immediate as it is profound.

In this light, the photograph reveals a stark truth: the true essence of profundity may not always reside in the grandeur of historical or religious narratives but often in the humble reflections of our everyday lives. This image‚Äôs power lies not in its composition but in its capacity to evoke a deep, introspective response, thus positioning it as a more compelling, and arguably more profound, artifact than the esteemed fresco of the Renaissance.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGREWXFyRERUbm1Ga1VhRzJjVncwcUg5VnZTaUNOZkw2X29lUlVUeVhjQmdCQWRZTjZGR2E4VWJUXzM0TnA3V25VbHZYMzItbGZaQ0F0LTlFZW9FNTFFZEstbkk5TnhRdlVtbkRrR3hUSXZiMHM9

Unfortunately it has been removed because videos must be in the .gif format. You should not use the native reddit video uploader, it is bad.

"Context: 
‚ÄúIn the Garden of Haminalahti is one of Finland‚Äôs best loved works of art. The Haminalahti estate was home to the von Wright brothers. Many of Ferdinand‚Äôs paintings depict dramatic scenes from nature, but here the overall mood is that of bourgeois serenity. The painting shows Ferdinand‚Äôs sister and her children. The children are feeding tame birds and sheltering from the hot sun under a parasol. The bluish tinge of lake Kallavesi and the house Ferdinand was building, Lugnet (Peace), can be seen further in the distance. A fence separates this civilized way of life from the world outside. Efforts were being made at the time to deepen the feelings of the Finnish people for their land, specifically by promoting affinity with Finland‚Äôs natural landscapes. But could it be that this painting is dear to us because we can identify with the people on this side of the fence?‚Äù

"I wasn't going to post anything about my interpretation of this. But here goes.

- the vacuum of space signifies missing experiences or perhaps naivety or innocence in the face of a culture which is absent of any bearings.

- The dislocation of the face represents dissociation or loss of identity.

- Specifically in relation to the archetypal chaste mother figure. 

- As if she is literally tearing what's left of your self from you.

- But she is also comforting you. It is that which makes it so terrible.

- The warped floors and the drugs, suggest drug user or perhaps addiction. Maybe to men or sex?

- The man with the mask is concealed, with a menu, perhaps of vices, ways of hiding who you are. 

- The painting might denote recovery from addiction or a particular lifestyle, the loss of identity in the vacuum of it, and the pain of losing the one thing true about the woman before the idea of god and the archetypal chaste woman. 

- alternate ending, the loss of one's face is almost liberating, to be rid of the objectification to show what truly lies beneath. 

- The pain of it is breathtaking, but also authentic. I hope I'm not totally off base.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRNUEpURGc3UTE0bnR6anBTNFM2bWV3WXZGS21LcTBLWWJ4QVVqQ3ctV2xoVUQ0N1ozN2JHQ2twczAwTWd3ZkZ5TEVuUnRkUjNMZmtDVlU5dG4tQlZsTmZZX1Q0UER0N3l0VXBxbEg5ejFyb3c9

"IIRC that was the implication of the broom. It symbolizes sexual promiscuity--supposedly with demons or Satan. 

For all that we often take historical concepts super out of context...the idea of a witch is that of a woman who breaks with social conventions and pursues things that make her happy, even at the expense of the community or in violation of common decency.

Witching Hours

The air was clean and crisp yet not in a frozen manner, alive with clarity and pure raw intent in her solitude, her hours.. me apart, a privy viewer, a thief of second nature, fitting as to not perturb. It seemed as if the stars were signets set in a deeply dark living tapestry, their awareness my own. The clouds swiftness just fast enough to not give away the secret meaning of life. And the glow illuminating the immediate landscape a mixture of familiarly unfamiliar cold luminance.

"Funniest part is it mostly started with bored housewives getting creative with broom handles. IIRC there was an illicit herbal drug that was best taken absorbed through mucosa membrane, and so they would rub the herbal blend all over the handle of a broom and proceed to ""ride"" it. The husbands would come home, catch then in the act, and think ""Am I just bad at satisfying my wife? No... This must be the work of Satan!""

"I love the concept and the execution. It's eye-catching, The illusion of depth is amazing.

The text has some very weird kerning in places, and the first two places I looked at it were the same text - it almost put me off reading it all. Periods are too good for you but commas aren't? Apostrophes are only okay in ""it's""? It even seems like some spaces are missing, as the cutoff for some lines is just in a weird place ""KindWi"" followed by ""s   e"".  
  
The prayer-like form of the writing matches the visual style, with the flowers and the circles.

I'm not sure if we're looking at a clipper or a single-masted viking boat here. The mast in view is off-centre and very far forward, and the deck is very small. I can't figure out whether the webbing of rope near the bow is a jib, rigging torn loose, or... well, I can't figure it out.

"Exordium
In ""Exordium,"" three tiny sea turtles embark on their first odyssey, emerging from the safety of their sandy nest under the vibrant hues of a dawning sky. The golden light of sunrise illuminates their path, casting long shadows across the sand as they make their way towards the vast ocean. Each tiny flipper beat, each determined push forward, echoes the universal struggle for growth and renewal. They are not merely turtles on a beach, but a reflection of our own journey towards the unknown.
This perilous journey, from the safety of their nest to the vast unknown of the ocean, is a testament to the resilience and determination inherent in all living beings. The tiny turtles, guided by an ancient instinct, brave the dangers of predators and the harsh elements, their survival a testament to the power of perseverance. While reaching the water is a victory in itself, it marks only the beginning of a lifelong journey of growth and transformation. Just as these sea turtles face the unknown with unwavering courage, so too must we embrace the challenges and uncertainties that life presents us, knowing that with each step forward, we inch closer to our full potential.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRnS2IwRWhZS0tSSXZUYmdTWlJOYTlkeXZCWG5oMU1Nd1VmUEYxQzA3MzNISmFRMks3dDA5N2xrbU96aXdZYVpQZUJNRTVuYTR4S0N2QTk5MTJKS3Z1TXc9PQ==

"The person on the left is a Doctor and the person on the right is their patient.

‚Äî-

In 3033, as an advanced society, there were many different technological advancements. This image focuses on Neurotransmitter Control.

Neurotransmitter Control:The ability to release specific neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, at will. Rather than relying on external drugs to alter their mood, people could simply choose to release these chemicals themselves. But this was a hard technique to master and people still relied on external neurotransmitter alteration (drugs) for assistance.

The ethical dilemmas were weighty. How much dominion over one‚Äôs mind was just? Could perpetual happiness ever be a worthy pursuit, or did it merely evade the reasons for sadness?

In this world, violence was minimal & poverty was nonexistent. This advancement, in my view, would elevate every individual to at least the third tier of Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs. From my perspective, there are numerous challenges that both individuals and society as a whole must confront before we each reach the pinnacle of self-actualization.

Below is the background:It was the year 3033 and the world was a very different place from what it had been just a handful of centuries earlier. Gone were the days of poverty, starvation, and clean water shortages. Violence was minimal, as people had learned to resolve their conflicts peacefully.In this future, energy was no longer solely sourced from the sun. Instead, it was taken from all environmentally positive sources.

Popular political tenants within the human solar systems were:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Individual freedom: The maximum amount of individual freedom and autonomy possible, while also recognizing the need for social and economic equality. This means that people should be able to make their own choices about how to live their lives, as long as those choices do not harm others.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Economic equality: A more equal distribution of wealth and resources is necessary in order to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue their own interests and goals. This could involve supporting policies like progressive taxation and social welfare programs.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Democracy: Emphasize the importance of direct democracy and participatory decision-making, as opposed to representative democracy. This means that people should have a direct say in the decisions that affect their lives, rather than solely relying on elected representatives to make those decisions for them.

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject.

"The word ""known"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting, there. 

It's usually ergot poisoning rather than psilocybin in the hypotheses. And the delivery method is oral and probably accidental. The idea that women used broomsticks as sex toys is a separate hypothesis.

There's almost zero evidence to support the ideas.

"Agree completely. In my personal head cannon, medieval German witches were just badass women who lived outside of societal norms and did freaky stuff with mushrooms and broomsticks, all the while laughing at their narrow minded villager peers.

"A free-spirited dark elf cleric I painted! She‚Äôs wielding the Spidesilk Whip, a D&D item I‚Äôve made!

Character: **Minathra Alendar, Dark Elf Light Cleric**

Minathra Alendar is a dark elf who grew up in the cities of the Underdark and learned the ways of Lolth. On the night of her first surface raid, she was enchanted by the beauty of the moonlight. She decided that she needs to stay on the surface where this beautiful light shines, instead of going back to the Underdark.

She managed to sneak away from the raid party and has been living in seclusion since. After praying to the moon for many nights, she heard the goddess Eilistraee answering her prayers. Ever since, she has been a follower of Eilistraee, trying to spread the beauty of the world, but especially the beauty of the moon to the people of the surface. Even if they didn't want to welcome her, she never took it personally since she knew what dark elves are capable of.

Minathra chooses to wear her spider-themed clothing as a reminder of what she escaped so that she may never return to that path of destruction and evil.

"So, two things; first off, I'd talk with whoever told you that you should place such trust in your perception, your ""eyes"" as you say it. Does the world consist of blurry forms because that's what you see? No, you probably have poor eyesight. Is a hallucination a part of external reality? No, you're the only one who's perceiving it. There's no reason to place such importance on personal perception, especially when it comes to the analysis of expressive material. 

Secondly, even if such weight were to be applied to your perception, the figure you identified as female is almost entirely turned away from your view. While you could make the argument that there are bio-markers that one could reasonably use to identify a human form as female versus male, those bio-markers exist on the front of the body and thus are not viewable here. It seems to me that you're basing your interpretation entirely on the green figure's ass. And I get it, it's a real bubble butt and I'm sure you find it hot. But to conclude that therefore this figure must be female simply because you're attracted to its butt I think says a lot more about you and how you see the world than anything else",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1R3ZZOHV4X1pQbDQ0T01nQXNEMVl6WWg2Rzd2S1V5UHhzcUpiNGJwUF95aWJjcmNoQ2ZodVNudEJIU3RQNnB1Sm01ZkVtZ0tlYkcyU0RreHkxZWVMN3c9PQ==

"Ergot is a problem when growing Rye grain. More often occurs in ""wet years"", which tend to be colder; so food grows slower or poorly, and people must choose either starvation or eating suspicious foods they would normally discard. 

There is a similar problem with onions.

Wheat is much less likely to get ergot mold but rye plants are much more hardy than wheat so it grows better in worse environmental conditions.

"Reminds me of an old Chinese torture/execution method I read about.

They would plant a plot of fresh bamboo chutes, then chain the victim down to the ground on top of it (all arms and legs splayed out)...

Then they'd just wait as the chutes burst through the soil and keep growing up through the body and keep growing.

The ever expanding bases would plug any leaks so to speak, resulting in wounds that don't bleed out.

"Well, you chose a very specific image of a gay man, one that is used mostly by heterosexuals to mock us, the leather daddy in heels. It's used because of the inherent dichotomy between the masculine and feminine... But almost no gay people behave anything like this. Its the kind of image homophobes use to decry pride parades, while ignoring the 99.99% of people who aren't dressed this way.

There is a lot of positive gay iconography out there and you chose exactly none of it, and went for the lowest, hyper sexualized stereotype there is

So you say you're not ridiculing gay culture, but you're using the worst possible face our community could present, and you're using it to paint a heterosexual man in a negative light. This isn't exactly a pro Putin post

And this furthers the false narrative that many homophobes are closeted gay men, which is not true. No, the bigotry is not coming from within. There are a lot of straight people out there who give us a hard time. Don't turn it around on us and say they're secretly one of us. They're not.

"Thank you /u/ESHLDS! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

"The rendering of the face is sensitively done, and just really lovely. The move from under her eyes down to the fullness of her cheeks and lips in particular.  Excellent shading, and modeling.  

There seem to be a lot of subtle visual tensions going on that make it nice and tangy.  For instance, The lines you use for hair around the face and the lines around the top of her head are done differently. The difference actually sets up some visual tension. It unconsciously catches the eye and gives your brain a little puzzle. 

Her expression seems neutral, slightly annoyed or melancholy depending on which features I look at. 

Having her looking down focuses attention on  her chest and breasts and the visual mystery of why nothing else is blue. She looks like ""Sigh, fine, I'll pull out the girls, just let me watch a movie. 

Her lips are good, but there is less certainty in the strokes and color. When I zoom in on them, the strokes don't completely support that 3D modeling. 

She looks like she's she could be on a computer or tablet. Except by cutting the blue off at the bottom of her throat, and making the hair and clothing one big mass tone. it gives a bit of a centered and spiritual vibe.

 It also makes that demarkation line between neck and chest more important than it's treated. 

The dip in the center of her clavicle should line up with the space between her breasts, even if her body is tilted. Then the connection is more of an arc.

A darker background, or in some way more intense would keep further focus on the face and chest.  There's something Madonna-like (Mother to Christ). Geez, I'd love to see her with an unusual halo or a really classic thin gold one.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQzY1BjbVBERjE2MExBUjFHcVZUdnRMTmxBNWRoU2pyZVRzX1k3eUxmVllQUVJKMldFQjlwV3dTTXVsQlFYS0hqVDJuZmdiWnJucERuWVRMOFdBUW03dWFBbktPd3ZJVXpzazczbktNWnhCcHc9

"Thank you /u/CompetitiveFunny2487! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

"A devout tiefling cleric and his trusty owlbear buddy I drew!

Characters**: Solace, Tiefling Twilight Cleric, and Asta the Owlbear**

Solace is a champion of the goddess Lunistra. Throughout his travels, he has been helping others while striving to get stronger so he can one day heal his father from paralysis.

He has made it his goal to help beings in need and offer healing. Lending aid to those who feel lost and scared during dark times and guiding those in need with compassion like a gentle, warm light. He stands within the twilight to guide all who are lost, as is his virtue and vow, which he has made his name.

Solace helps people find solace within their darkness and nurture the light within it, allowing them to see that like how day turns to night and vice versa, life is everchanging, and the one cannot exist without the other.

During his travels, Solace found Asta as a lone owlbear cub in a shady shop that had obvious ties to the black market. Without second thought, Solace took the young cub. And so, he had a new animal friend with him on the adventure.

Through their journeys, they've become a strong duo, a cleric and his trusted animal companion.

During their travels, Asta has been blessed by Lunistra through Solace‚Äôs divine magic and has grown faster and stronger to aid in their quests, becoming akin to a spiritual familiar.

Unfortunately it has been removed because videos must be in the .gif format. You should not use the native reddit video uploader, it is bad.

Note that animations should be posted only for art 3D in nature like for instance sculpture or performance arts. Progress videos or tutorials are not allowed, instead post an image of the finished work.

"Thank you for your input. This just started from me looking at a pinterest reference of a girl I thought would be cool to draw, and posting the final drawing on here to possibly gain some traction as I am a small artist. I have done a little more research on the photo reference I used, and I believe they may have used ai to generate the reference. I was not previously aware of this, so I thank you and others on here for pointing that out. 

Regardless, the drawing I have created based off that reference is an original by ME and me alone. There are also many other artists who have used this exact reference to create their own art off of.

Here is a [link](https://pin.it/JzFfAgUTH) to the reference if you would like to see it

It is a little bit discouraging to see how many people have been sceptical as to whether or not this is ai, considering how much time i put into this piece.. However I do thank you and many others on here for pointing out how it can be taken that way.

"A fearsome half-demon ranger who now fights to protect the world of mortals in our campaigns in Theomachy! Xerribex is wielding The Ravager, a D&D item I made!

Character: **Xerribex, Half-Demon Planar Sentinel Ranger**

Born in Maleficum, the dimension of demonic magic, Xerribex is powerful ranger who walks the fine line between dimensions, protecting her fiery home and all that is precious to her. Xerribex was destined to be a ruthless champion, punishing the agents of the warring gods as well as innocent mortals indiscriminately.

However, after meeting Sir Delric Thorson, a theomachist paladin who had been enslaved in Maleficum, she began to wonder about morality. She claimed Sir Thorson as her personal slave, seeking to prove him na√Øve. But during their travels together, the good paladin was able to show her the value of mortal life, making her realize that the true threat to Maleficum, and the entire creation, is the war between the gods.

Now, Xerribex uses her unique heritage to freely travel between demonic dimensions and fight the warring gods who threaten to undo creation itself in their mad bid for supremacy.

**About the Theomachy setting:**

In Theomachy, vengeful gods fight each other for ultimate control of the universe, while the mortals of Naam struggle for power on a dying world. Divine magic is a force without expressed will that the warring gods hoard and wield against each other, threatening to undo the entire world. Clerics and paladins are either devout followers of the warring gods or theomachists who fight against the gods, liberating divine magic and using it against them.

So I felt quite vulnerable when I was trying to sit out on our deck, home alone with my eyes closed not knowing what could be around the corner.

So instead of demonizing these parts of myself that were trying to keep me safe from what could've been around the corner, I embraced them with love and acceptance. They are scary because they feel like they have to play that role, but if you take that burden away, they are friend OuO.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVMNjJUWExQNVhjN0RHLUZ6dU8zZkdKYl9McXhmYklmRkpIQXZpd0UyNWQ2dDdLZUlDSVBON1ZhVnpHazMwX2V3UFloNWdyR1ZRam45ZFhucUlwWTFrWXc9PQ==

"I‚Äôm not an art historian and I have limited reading of the artist‚Äôs and painting‚Äôs histories. I do believe the work was better received in Britain and the USA.

Ironically, she was painted in a similar portrait, similar pose, strap off one shoulder by Gustave Courtois with a positive response. And again by another artist straps up.

I suppose, if I‚Äôm lucky, I‚Äôll be invited to pose for other talented artists üòÇ but I doubt it. I would not say I‚Äôm a classical beauty by any measure, nor am I a society lady married to a wealthy banker.  

The point of the painting is much more the controversy that seems to surround the transgender experience (or those ‚Äúaccused‚Äù of being transgender as the Olympic Games have again demonstrated).

I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of people who will say it‚Äôs an ugly portrait of a man in a dress. Or that I stole an opportunity from a real woman to be in a portrait. That my shoulders are too broad, my lines are not soft and graceful and my hands are too big. And ironically those critics are more likely to be British or American and not French given the state of our political divisiveness.

If you are pre-gaming your insults I hope you are also snacking on a little self esteem self talk. They don't need your help! That's all I can say about it, because while I can imagine, I can't really know. I do know about shame, and being bewildered by my own body. 

I was thinking about what you said. I literally have no idea what normal is really like--in terms of experience. Sorry,...well, it inspired thoughts.  
  
I know, I'm my own normal, but physically, I've literally never experienced it. I am a CIS female who is currently 5'10"" 325lbs with size 12.5 feet. I have ADHD (diagnosed) and possible Autism or CPTSD which is a little bit of all of the above. Abused at home and bullied at school. How do people trust each other let alone just say, hey, bestie? Because that literally never happens to me. I was thin for a hot minute, that was not as good as I thought it would be. You don't know why people are looking at you. And they aren't really seeing a person. Okay, tired of so sorry me.

"I wrote this based on your painting. I hope you don't mind and enjoy it.

The hooded figure stood, looking out across the raging sea at the Middle Sister. He had just finished the climb back down from the lowest of the glacial mountains, known as the Three Sisters. 

Nobody had ever managed to summit the Big Sister, just visible on the distant horizon, though many had died trying. The Middle Sister would be a brutally hard test, he knew. It was said that the Gods dwelt in the upper reaches of the Big Sister and, should any mortal climb all Three Sisters, they would be granted their hearts desire. 

The screaming of the gulls circling the Middle Sister broke his reverie. Tomorrow he would begin the crossing. Today the sea was too rough. He hoped his tent would keep out more of the cold that his winter clothing had. At least it wasn't snowing. It was too cold for that.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVMFM0VUV3WUFPd245d3BZcnlkMGtEMVRPekFkd1BVX1VBb1Axdm1leUIzX3R4QU4zc25SLTcyZkEzQmJUN2lSdWRHXzNzNHpVRjF0WDlYdko2U083ZUE9PQ==

"I think a lot of people know wlop, and there are a lot of newer paintings of theirs that have way more detail and look impressive in all sorts of ways, but I wanted to post this old one, because it showcases one of the things I most admire this artist for - the ability to lay down brush strokes that simultaneously look very rough and messy, and yet are insanely expressive and perfectly convey what they're supposed to convey.

Thank you for the insight. I show this style at work (not this particular art) and most say I‚Äôd like to see it in colour. I can‚Äôt paint and I don‚Äôt want to waste more time collecting more paper (I had enough for my lifetime) and I appreciate the fact that you see what I see. It‚Äôs not about the colour but it‚Äôs how the art is so monotone that if you just don‚Äôt pay attention enough you won‚Äôt see the art but if you spend more time looking at it you‚Äôll see the picture as a whole. I guess in a world dominated by vibrant colours monotone colour is something different that grabs ones attention too.

"Alright, I'll say it. This is AI generated.  
Reasoning: 1. Brushstrokes seem unreal, they appear as a stippled uniformity that is common to Dalle and certain Midjourney styles. 2. This user has previously posted on Midjourney and Dalle subs, with a style similar to this (stringy, Beksinski vibe). 3. Given the users reddit history, they must be incredibly shy about their \\*stellar\\* painting work. There are no other painting posts, no WIPs or participation in other painting subs, and not a single post or comment about painting or art in general before the two posted in the last 3 days.  
  
I am happy to eat my foot if the user posts a candid WIP of this piece or their other, or a shot of them touching the surface of the canvas/panel of either piece in a natural environment/room. If the painting isn't available, a simple candid shot of their workspace and art supplies might suffice.

"Thank you /u/HeAdLiNe_10! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

">a warehouse with literally no lights in South Bronx.

Photographers find light, or they make their own. And you did, but with a direct flash, which only someone as good as Weegee could get away with, back in the day.

To me your photo looks like a paparazzo snap.

I want to see an eye for existing light and maybe even some interesting lighting choices involving a couple of strobes or flashguns. Pointing an on-camera speedlight and shooting in auto can result in decent photojournalism if you know what you're doing but for a ""portrait"" this photo is subpar (to my eye). If you ever want to explore good lighting, and expand you toolbox, check out the work of Zach Arias, Joe McNally, or Greg Heisler.

"I believe that all good art is polarizing, and I don‚Äôt expect to appeal to everyone. This approach isn‚Äôt about setting up softboxes and strobes; it‚Äôs more akin to paparazzi-style photography‚Äîquick and spontaneous. You get one shot and you‚Äôre moving on‚Äìno redos. It also isn‚Äôt the safest environment as you can imagine and I try to avoid bringing extra gear. The goal isn‚Äôt to create perfect images (I attempt that in other work), but to capture a particular feeling. I think it captures that well.

I appreciate your feedback and, while I admire some of the artists you mentioned, I‚Äôm committed to my own style. Best of luck and continuation on anything you‚Äôre working on as well.

"I went to school for biology, and got to know professors throughout all the science departments. Pretty much all of them were artists in some way--music, writing, knitting, painting, whatever else.

To hear them talk about it, art and science are two sides of the same coin. Having dabbled in various arts myself, I get it. You need to hone technical skills, plan ahead, and think critically. Once you have the skills, you need to perform simple, repetitive work over and over to create the piece. All of that is stuff that any researcher is very familiar with as part of their job.

"Autobiography, a painting by me

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting. Before I explain the painting here is some background. In the Colombian Amazon a place called Serrania de Lindosa. It‚Äôs a 8 mile stretch of rock with thousands of paintings and most of them seem to be autobiographical. They showed hunting or farming more regular every day life stuff. This might (I say might because I couldn‚Äôt confirm) the oldest example of mass biographical/autobiographical paintings. So this is my painting. The numbers are the longitude and latitude of the Serrania de Lindosa. I wanted to paint my autobiography. And a big part of my life is my low self esteem. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a talented enough artist to properly paint my autobiography. But so much of my life is just me being depressed. I don‚Äôt remember much else. So the painting outside the words is my autobiography. The drawing is supposed to be a candle. It‚Äôs incomplete because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm talented enough to complete it. And the words can essentially be translated to ‚ÄúI Am Sorry (to the people of) Sierra de Lindosa‚Äù because I feel inadequate when I compare my painting to theirs. There painted were 12600 years ago so in theory art should have progressed 12600 years forward. I should be the product of 12600 years of progress butI don‚Äôt feel like I am. I feel the need to apologize to them for my inadequacy.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmaWUwckN1SDQxTU5nUVBuWHVlUmZ4a3hVWGxuQklVMVlsNHp3MzM1ZTJFU2tXeEpVRU8yT1FkcV9ubFVsSnJnUFRMbjhvWUhsLWJvRnZ1cVY5SjFLV0E9PQ==

"Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any cool lore or fantasy for itü•≤ It was originally a self portrait of sorts that I sketched in my journal to express my inability to desire things that drive any other living being. I had been exploring the idea of what defines consciousness/organic life and developed a sort of like-ness to modern technology, an eager child taught to exist only off of previous human experience, but not given the blessing of what these desires feel like, only poems and descriptions of what it is supposed to be. So here my little robot stands, a machine convinced it is human. Her whole existence devoted to things unrelated to her own interests, because her thoughts are only echoes of others. All of this work to still be othered, a part of her so obviously mechanical, which everyone but her is aware of.

"Well you made this and so you're already way ahead of the VAST MAJORITY of people who only ever think about making something without ever actually creating anything. You made this! And this is only a first step! As long as you keep taking steps you keep advancing. Some people might advance quicker but the goal is to never stop, even if the steps are small, even if it takes a long time, keep stepping forward. Otherwise you'll never go anywhere. 

Artistic ability is not something that is handed down from generation to generation. Every artist must start from zero, but like I said before, the important part is that you *start* - which you have now done! That part is already behind you. So just keep on moving, at your own pace. 

You are not inadequate. You are only just getting started. (How exciting!) Even the most talented artists start from nothing. The talent grows not in your genes, but from practice.

"Thank you! Of course, it‚Äôs really just a lot of sponging and splattering in a very specific order of layers using a palette of around 8-10 colours, normally sponging a set of colours first, then splattering the same colours on top, before finishing it off with some more sponging until you get the desired effect! Other details can be painted in manually after.

"Shadya seeking to look harmless and delightful as she tries to win over key figures who could become strong allies to the escaped demon-elf rebels of Khemhotep.

Character: **Shadya the Black Lotus, Demon-Elf Bard of Whispers**

Born an elf and trained as an entertainer, Shadya was at one point the courtesan of Prince Ankhator, the royal heir of the legendary elven kingdom of Khemhotep. When Khemhotep descended whole to the deepest hell, Pandemonium, as part of a mad scheme to defeat the vengeful gods of Naam and dominate the multiverse, Shadya was one of the first to undergo the painful transformation to become a demon-elf of Khemhotep, forcefully exchanging her elven nature for fiendish power.

Crafty and ambitious, Shadya used her skills to escape the hellish oppression of Khemhotep and the demonic fires of Pandemonium, returning to Naam under disguise. Now, she is plotting and scheming to regain her place in a world that has forgotten elves and despises demons.

Shadya is one of my own characters in Theomachy! You may recognize her from lots of other sketches, illustrations, and homebrew!

**About the Theomachy setting:**

In Theomachy, vengeful gods fight each other for ultimate control of the universe, while the mortals of Naam struggle for power on a dying world. Divine magic is a force without expressed will that the warring gods hoard and wield against each other, threatening to undo the entire world. Clerics and paladins are either devout followers of the warring gods or theomachists who fight against the gods, liberating divine magic and using it against them.

**What do you think? :)**",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVocjd4b3dCRmFuOFk5dGN3ZmVaMHlMN2VodG9RVUkzZmt5LWJCcm5RTXhxYXdQcWFhUGFfTEtYYjJsRndSWEFCamtYbXlfWnFUY29fVmJfbjRtV0QzRVE9PQ==

"Thank you /u/mod-ro! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

"(""Departure"")Aevum Volatus
(""The Flight of Ages"")
Against a canvas ablaze with the nascent hues of dawn, a skein of geese ascends, their silhouettes etching a fleeting testament against the eternal sky. Each downy feather, each outstretched wing, speaks of a journey etched into the very marrow of their being - a pilgrimage not merely across continents, but through the ceaseless cycle of life, death, and renewal. This is a flight that transcends the ephemeral, a dance with the winds of time that has been performed countless times before, yet is forever new. For in the immutable rhythm of their migration, these geese embody the very essence of ""aevum volatus"" - the flight of ages, a testament to the enduring spirit that soars through the tapestry of existence, forever returning, forever transformed.
Just as these geese retrace their ancient path, so too do we navigate the familiar landscapes of our lives. Yet, like the ever-shifting currents of the air they ride, we are never truly the same. Each return is a voyage of rediscovery, each repetition an opportunity for growth. For even as we revisit the familiar, the essence of who we are evolves, ensuring that every journey, every flight, is an exploration into the uncharted territories of our own becoming. Embrace the rhythm of your own ""aevum volatus,"" and in each familiar step, find the thrill of the unknown.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV5VmlxMGs1cTNwa0pFaS1icG1jU2JHbkkyMFo0RTR6TVlydjEtcTU0TW5WZjhzZHo2WGZ6SmV5OGRKWXo0RkNCcDQ5S3NDQk9Uak1yYzlpLV9jU0FHa3c9PQ==

"accentuating risque poses, figures, or body parts is all fine and good, but this one puts a spot light on her thong, leaving the rest practically blacked out. The first thing my eyes hit on looking at this, and all I saw initially was ""ASS."" A softer lighting, or a lighting gradient would probably get the same impact point and feel, but also give your eyes a path up her back and into the glare and reflection.

"Are you familiar with the works of Anatoly Fomenko? 

I think you might be trying to reach the same place he got to.

Perhaps you may need to learn to play chess to present an ongoing chess game in a believable way.

This looks like a forfeit after a stalemate, to me, except there are no kings on the board, just an impossible knight.

How does the chess game go on with only one piece on the board?

This reminds me of an anonymous work I saw years ago called ""No Detour"" with a lone figure in the foreground, the midground a forest of blazes, and beyond the fire people enjoying life in the background. The person in the foreground just has to step through the fire to get to the other side.

Your piece, though, has no opponent, no challenge, and no chess match, just an open road, eight lanes wide, to discover along the way.

So: how is it an ongoing chess game?",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6TG1tX1d4M2FDbDQ1MFBUcmhoYmw3bko2Qzc1Q0NUa2tOS1lUUUViVGpubHU0Xzc4VjBHUGZXU2pQMXE1LTNOTGNiRjBvLWFjYVNJemVGR3hrU214SGc9PQ==

"I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the works of Fomenko, I gave a look and found them really interesting! I see how you would recall him seeing my work.
I in fact know how to play chess and know its rules: you see in this drawing lots of element of the game are distorted, beginning from the board. This last is really really long (a parallelism to one‚Äôs years of living) but it finds its end in another living thing (a tree, that is recurrent in this drawing) and not just with death. So we could say that the opponent is the board itself: life and the death at its end, and its pieces are scattered at the end of the board for us to not be able to see as they are too far away (a metaphor for the difficulties in life that we cannot forecast).
The last rule I broke is that we have only one piece: the horse. It is indeed the most erratic one, moving in L and jumping around, giving a feeling of confusion and uncertainty. I guess I decided for it to be the only one because it better represent the loneliness with which we face life, but also because we can find the other pieces by going forward (friends, knowledge, wisdom‚Ä¶) and we are not meant to have them at the beginning.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV6ZEpMclZpaGRlQXliWmxkRXNFRnRVOVoxSEZxelZIY1RnQ0Nkc1lvRF9odlZ6TkhqX1Z6OVhoSTlEbV96OUd2cXV5NEhEcEd4UEpnWGdrblpVNlJYd2c9PQ==

Also call me crazy but I don‚Äôt even find these to usually be that seedy, maybe that‚Äôs something weird in my upbringing but to me there‚Äôs a certain wholesomeness to finding the human in these comedically disgusting portrayals?

Unfortunately it has been removed because videos must be in the .gif format. You should not use the native reddit video uploader, it is bad.

Note that animations should be posted only for art 3D in nature like for instance sculpture or performance arts. Progress videos or tutorials are not allowed, instead post an image of the finished work.

We look forward to seeing your work when you have an account in compliance with sitewide guidelines.

"Hi Peter,

This one inspired me to write again. I agree with
 u/imaboredcosplayer, this should  be in a children's book.

Enjoy...

'The little girl regarded the creature uncertainty. She had found it while wandering through the forest. She had gotten lost. It didn't seem unfriendly to her, but her mother had told her to be careful. Talking to random forest creatures was definitely not 'being careful'. It was mostly covered in moss and dirt, except for a mane of brightly coloured flowers around a white wood mask.

The Keeper regarded the strange animal before it. In all its centuries tending the forest, it had never seen anything like this before. The animal had been making what the keeper thought of as happy noises, like a chirping bird, until it saw him. Now it was stood there, watching him. The keeper noticed that this animals mane was made of long, blonde fur. Reaching up, the keeper did the only thing it could think to.

Curious, the girl watched as the creature plucked a flower from its mane. Slowly, careful not to startle her, it leant forward and tucked the flower behind her ear. This task done, the creature shambled off into the forest, leaving the bemused girl behind.'",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4ekFyUFoxcmp5QURabzZNWHlPNktrTkZFZ3Fxc3B4bF82WHRSVGN3S3VsdjJ0WU54OHFTSWFfUFNUazA4c1VRZ3RkRVdHeTJLdl9iOHZsRG9pV0hRUkE9PQ==

"So there was a similar comment like this in another sub and I replied with an explanation about these paintings I‚Äôve posted lately. This is a copy of my reply (it‚Äôs a bit long. Hope you don‚Äôt mind).

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
‚ÄúThank you a lot for your compliments and advice, I really appreciate it. Turns out, what you‚Äôre saying is right. When I first started this style (June 2019), artists such as Basquiat, Noel Fielding had been the ones that guided and inspired me so much through their great artworks. But I also haven‚Äôt had much chance to paint and practice a lot due my personal work and I don‚Äôt have many paintings yet. I‚Äôve been working as a game designer, making zen paintings (at Visuddhi Art Studio) and just graduated university last year with a degree in interior design. For the last 5 years, I only made 11 or 12 paintings in this style (including the Party Animals collection if you count all of them as one piece), and the last one was in June 2022 (Hideaway). This painting, Good Together, was actually done at the end of January 2022 (before Lunar New Year), then I decided to fix it for the last time yesterday, after 2 years it stayed in a corner of my house. That‚Äôs why I wrote 2024 instead of 2022.

In some paintings, I think they are representing myself well, and in some paintings like Hideaway or this one, I look up to my favorite Basquiat‚Äôs artwork such as Hens Meyer because fell in love with its concept. The whole time these paintings were what I have done in my free time as my hobby, my practicing and studying art from the greatest artists. Never did I believe that one day I would be able to be a professional artist with this style until last year, I decided to follow this path. However, to be able to represent myself better, all I can do right now is to keep studying, practicing and developing until I can reach that goal.

The crown on my painting is not the crown from Basquiat but it‚Äôs from the tattoo on my boyfriend‚Äôs arm as it‚Äôs the symbol of his grandfather‚Äôs brand. It‚Äôs the letter M that stands for Martin and looks like a cowboy hat. So with the love for Basquiat, I wanted to put this symbol on the painting to remind me of his iconic crown. But again, I don‚Äôt hide a the truth I‚Äôm using a lot of similar elements like ladders, words, shapes, ‚Ä¶ I understand deeply that there‚Äôs still a really long way ahead for me to know how to control or portrait my own vision and ideas. 

I just got back to social media not so long ago, trying to post all the old artworks first. So I hope everyone will be patient and check out my new paintings which I‚Äôm working on right now. They will come soon.

Edit: So sorry for bad English üòÖ. ‚Äú

You can check my profile to see the picture of the tattoo I mentioned in this post https://www.reddit.com/u/eddiecool123/s/8Oc0Y6pocm . I‚Äôve wasted a long time doing what I wasn‚Äôt happy with and these paintings with the similar art style of Basquiat were during the time I was practicing and finding my own style (2022), and maybe it was an escape from reality. So I just got back to working on a few days ago starting with fixing this painting. Now I‚Äôm trying to post all of my old works. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm making some new paintings at the same time. I‚Äôm always grateful with every thought and advice to help me develop myself in the future.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5dlpMQkVEd3VDdFV3elNOUUZFWVczRUdPbmRzUXBEOXVfMWhjdzRWMlJjUl9Ic0ZvX3oxVzVUd1FydGJmS0pXMWtBdzBpcE5YWnpkUmNoQ2NENXgtbHc9PQ==

"Initially, I started out doing ink contour line drawings from life. Either a live model or myself just sitting in front of a mirror. This often results in odd proportions and crooked, wonky eyes, etc. Sometimes that's cool specifically because of the unique imperfections, but I was curious to see what a more ""accurate"" contour line drawing would look like. Now, for the last two years (ish), I've been working almost entirely from photo references. This allows me to really slow down, sketch everything out in pencil, get all the proportions correct, and THEN do a contour line drawing over top.

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject.

The still waters of the bay reflected the riot of colours around them. Where the breeze kissed the water, it turned those colours into a dazzling kaleidoscope.

A defiant half-orc barbarian from our games in Theomachy!

Character: **Durma Frostpaw, Half-Orc Barbarian (plus Nebo, her trusty bear!)**

Durma is a strong and independent warrior who roams the frozen mountains and wild plains of what is now the Empire of Krestovo. As the last of her tribe, she has sworn vengeance against Gorg, the god of war, and his followers for decimating her people.

Living off the land and employing hit-and-run tactics, she has defeated many of Gorg‚Äôs red crusaders. However, a reclusive shaman warned her that waging war against the god of war himself is madness, as Gorg‚Äôs rage will eventually consume anyone who fights him.

Despite the risk of losing her mind in Gorg‚Äôs bloodlust, Durma is determined to cleanse her ancestral lands from the god‚Äôs red crusaders. During a particularly harsh winter, Durma saved a lost bear cub from certain starvation, naming him Nebo. Since then, Nebo has been her trusty companion in her fight against the Empire of Krestovo.

"I remember learning about Happy Jack in high school; this painting was my art teachers favourite. 

To me this piece appears to be an Australian farmer in his 60s. The Australia earth-tone colour palette also seems to reiterate my idea that this is a man who has spent his life working the land. As most Australian farmers did during this time period, they spent nearly the entirety of their life trying to sustain their farm and feed their family. From dusk until dawn, these farmers would work in the dry, dusty and arid conditions because it was all they knew. 

He looks happy but he also looks tired and withdrawn. During the time in which Happy Jack was painted, Australia was experiencing one of its worst droughts in history, which can also be depicted in the background of this piece. 

Work was hard, money was scarce; but despite this Jack always managed to have a smile on his face.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZQdWFGLV9BRW5KQkpaM1VQNERZemx4RUxJaDZJVjRIamh3N2V5WUo2YUhKbklaUHkyNUhLZ3VsWnpUdVRsalF5eFhVUEZfWUh6S1dIb3hlTm9Tb3N2RXFnQldZVlo0WUk4VnNLWnBTc1pGbjg9

"This just made me think of Westworld: ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt look like anything to me.‚Äù And I get that it‚Äôs not supposed to visually resemble anything, but it doesn‚Äôt even evoke an emotion in me.

I feel like it could have been called ‚Äúdeath of the firstborn‚Äù and it would still hit me the same way. But again, that probably says more about me than anything else. 

Thinking about it, I can understand how the bright contrasting colors and chaotic nature could evoke the feeling of an audience laughing, but I don‚Äôt think I would have gotten there without knowing the title first. Then I feel like I‚Äôm overthinking and grasping.

"This hemi-circular design was inspired by WWII era Flieger watches, particularly made by Elgin. I wanted to modernize the concept of a flieger watch of that time but still pay homage to certain design elements and the feelings it evoked. The word Flieger is german and translates to ""Flier"" which in this day and age is more compatible with people flying all over the world and changing GMT zones. This was the basis for my decision to create an Automatic GMT Flieger. The dial is plated with a thick layer of 18K gold, it has also been protected by a UV-resistant nano coating that would ensure that it remains pristine for decades to come. The dial has a 6 O'clock date window with a lumed date-disc. I chose this feature to mainly reference the 6 O'clock position for easy reading of time using the hour and minute hands. Part of the dial design is an embossed and textured image of the front view of a British WWII Spitfire fighter plane, above the ""Flieger"" script.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhaWNnY2lnRVJJUEo1SlZDbXpUcHdObi1vQ19KZHp6bl9jUUJqcGNfZjE1YWNhc3JBNGtvRmZMSG9sMU9PcHNkQ3BOUHg0RFI4bUJXYnRfYldMRDNRSkE9PQ==

"52 Hertz, Tommy Martin, Acrylic on Canvas (80x120cm), 2018

‚Äú52 Hertz is the name of a special whale that is well-known as the world‚Äôs loneliest whale. 
Since the first time scientists discovered it in the Pacific Ocean in 1989, they have never 
been sure if this creature belongs to any whale species because of its very unusually high 
frequency -52 Hz. Some people said that this whale had been living for a century, swiming 
through many seas and oceans in the world just to find a partner for its own. Sadly, It has 
never made it. When I worked on this painting, it was the time that I felt so lonely. At some 
point, I saw myself in this creature. Living in an Asian family and having seven older sisters 
are not easy, especially when you are the only son, the youngest, and also gay.‚Äù

"lol, incidentally, yes and no at once: it started as a ""trois-crayons"" (sanguine, pierre-noire, white, on warm toned paper), which is a rather old technique; but I thought it looked too dull, so I've extended things with pastels, and ended up having fun with colors.

"A crafty rogue from our D&D campaigns in Theomachy! Here, she is using the Fabulous Wig, an item we‚Äôve made!

Character: **Hao Min, Human Master Thief and Disguise Expert**

Born in Crilong, the Red Dragonrealm, Hao Min is a strong-willed and roguish woman of extraordinary cunning and dexterity who loves independence and a good adventure.¬†

Hao Min was raised in a Lifeism monastery that focused on the teachings of the legendary red dragonborn sage Umo-Wu about passion, optimism, and pleasure. Hao Min took the teachings of Umo-Wu at heart, and as she grew up and honed her skills, she rejected concepts such as authority and ownership.

She left the monastery just before her training was over to experience the world and claim what she felt she should have. In the years that followed, she became famous for a number of extraordinary heists and elaborate cons that left even the shrewdest dragonborn inspectors scratching their heads.

Her secret? Hao Min never really does anything for profit. Deep down, she is still motivated by Umo-Wu‚Äôs teachings and pursues passion, optimism, and pleasure. In secret, her long-term plan is to reclaim the Ten Sacred Dragonscrolls from the traitorous lords and enemies of the dragons that stole them during the civil Dragonwars.

"Randomly saw this when stumbling through /r/Art :) I love it, just like other pieces of art from you, going by looking at your profile just now :D What is your favorite Artwork of the ones you posted so far? I realized that this one looks a bit similar to the girl from your artwork ""Taking a break"" from a year ago. Like an alter ego. But that might be my own fantasy going wild. Also, I noticed the graffiti you use in a lot of your artworks. Do you just do that because you feel like it, is it to give the whole thing your own spin or does that have a specific reason and background? The question comes from noticing that the amount often varies and I wondered if that has a deeper meaning. I can also get if you don't want to talk about it of course.

I also hope that you don't mind me asking but can you recommend anything specific if it comes to learning to draw in a similar style? How did you learn it? :)

"Floriography, or the language of flowers, was a wonderful way for the Victorians to convey hidden meanings through the flowers they gifted.

I think it's time to revive this tradition and start putting together bouquets based on the symbolism of the flowers. Like this one.

I call it my ""fuck you""-bouquet, with a ""bless your heart"" as a cherry on top. First p√≠xeled, then cross-stitched. üíê

FLORIOGRAPHY:
- Aconitum napellus: a foe is near, deceit
- Fumaria: hatred

- Ocimum basilicum: hatred

This series of paintings reflects the social interaction consequences of the covid pandemic. With the social distancing and the mandatory use of protective gear (masks, suits, etc) people became unrecognizable, distant.
The only elements free from the interference of such gear were the eyes. In my research while doing these works, i talked to several doctors and nurses that stated that their patients (some of them from a long time) failed to recognized them.
This is why, in these paintings, the eyes are the only thing with color. It is the only element recognizable.

"A significant amount of art through humanity's history has been focused on the nude form. From depictions of the female form, like ""The Venus of Willendorf"" (est. 30,000 years old), to Michelangelo's male figure ""David"". 

As to the why: we are often inspired to create art because of the beauty we perceive in the natural world. Birds, flowers, sunsets, anything we find novel and awe-inspiring can cause us to want to create art that reflects the wonder we feel.

So if you consider the natural beauty of the human form, and add into that the biological urge to have sex and the soul's desire to connect with and understand others, you can see why so much of art reflects the nude form: because we can each draw different inspirations from it, leading to various and varied depictions. 

For example, look at the works of H.R. Giger and Frida Kahlo, and compare how each views the human form and utilizes it in their art. Both have a reverence for the female form in particular, but create vastly different art pieces from that inspiration. Additionally, to someone like Michelangelo: who found the male form more compelling, these views and inspirations would have never even occurred. 

So there are as many ways to portray the nude form as there are people to do the portraying, because each one of us sees a different aspect of beauty in it.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZraHgxZFRfM0ZnTHpsNFpGU1ZfNU1mRkdWZFVwTkF4Z1N2WThlS2paV2xDS0syRDB2SHc1eHJ6VUFEV3BselJ5YlpYblBRWS0zemtES0hkX3BTd0pYOFE9PQ==

"Great question! So for premixing, I usually just focus on mixing based on what element I‚Äôm working on at a given moment. I won‚Äôt premix for the entire painting per se so that cuts down on the concerns over things drying too fast. BUT, the fast drying is still an issue nevertheless. I use a wet palette to keep my paints from drying on the palette. Look up the brand Mastersons Sta-wet palette!

"Because people are lazy and sex sells. That‚Äôs the short answer. 

The long answer is that the naked human form is the most recognizable form we know. We are hard wired to see it, read it and to appreciate it. It‚Äôs the basis for our concept of beauty. If agreeable it most often represent health and makes us happy. We are simply just built to appreciate it.

This ties in to my short answer in how artists USE the human form. A youthful, fit woman in the nude will automatically appeal to people. Putting her in good lighting, and in some interesting surroundings isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äòeasy‚Äô as any picture like this requires planning, preparation and patience as well as technical skill. But it‚Äôs lazy relative to how actually important artworks use the human form. This picture tells us nothing.

It's common expression, "" I will die defending this hill (topic),"" meaning you won't change your mind, and/or don't care what happens to you defending your argument.

As for your question, when we are talking about ""self portrait"" these are words with pretty clear definitions in the English language, which is basically a consensus or agreement between people so that we can communicate and understand each other.

"Have you ever been to Artstation? Or Pixiv? Or any website known for hosting anime artists? Because there is scores and scores of ""anime"" art that looks just like this. Anime art is a wide spectrum of styles. Katsuya Terada is objectively known as an artist who creates anime art. Here is his wiki intro if you don't believe me:

>Katsuya Terada (ÂØ∫Áî∞ ÂÖã‰πü, Terada Katsuya, born December 7, 1963), is a Japanese illustrator and cartoonist from the town of Tamano, Okayama. His alias is the portmanteau Rakugakingu („É©„ÇØ„Ç¨„Ç≠„É≥„Ç∞, ""Doodle King""). Terada's prolific visual arts practice uniquely straddles the lines between manga, fine art, and digital design.[1] His work ranges widely from highly detailed comics and novel illustrations to expressive, futuristic character designs for video games and anime.[2] Terada posts actively on Facebook as Katsuya ""t e r r a"" Terada,[3] as well as on his web blog terra's book.[4]

"God forbid OP should want to represent a different aspect of themselves and call it a self-portrait. Or name their art ""self-portrait."" Or be a fictional shark artist making meta commentary.

Art holds a lot of space for different interpretations of rules. If you reduce the art itself into your interpretation of a rule and fail to see other interpretations, the art is either not amazing or you're missing out on a lot of creativity and meaning. 

If you reduce the art into your interpretation of a rule and no one gains any appreciable insight from your opinion, then 

you are changing the art instead of interacting with it.

"The pink accents in one half of the image and red in the other is so good, but I do find the top half easier to look at because the red doesn't contrast so sharply with the green.

I recently watched Gravity Falls, a show from my childhood, so I'm very sympathetic to forests right now, and the colors are just perfect for this photo. This art gives me a rare feeling I have never been able to explain, but I think it's a guilty feeling. Maybe I feel regret that my life isn't ever this mood? I don't know, I think there are songs that make people feel this way. 

I love the way the flora looks in this. It's so serene to me personally. I love the subtle graininess

This makes me feel like there are feelings that I want to feel but I can't fully feel them. The last time I contemplated this feeling was about 10 years ago, and back then I kind of just wanted to repent for whatever I did wrong.

It's like this artwork is God, and I know I am not close to God so I feel guilty. What this brings to the world is better on so many levels than anything I've given the world. It's like I'm looking a the garden of Eden and I have no idea where it is, and I can't find out, so I feel left out of a feeling that I want to know.

"The composition of this piece is well thought out and stunning. The contrast between a monochrome red color scheme and the white rat atop a pile of chocolate makes the rat and its hoard stand out and attract the eye in an entrancing way at the focal point of the piece. The detail displayed by the rat shows that you have a strong understanding of anatomy. Not only do you understand the anatomy of the rat, but you have the skill to make its posture incredibly expressive. This piece has a strong attention to detail; from the scratches left on the chocolate by the rat's hind leg to the detailing on the boxes, that creates a vivid impression on the viewer. The pattern and design of the background works well to create a sense of movement, reminiscent of waves crashing up against rocks on the coast, without distracting from the focal point. A moment of chaos frozen in time, this piece uses the defensive expression of the rat, the dominating use of red, the chaotic movement of the background, and the well worn appearance of the boxes to create a strong feeling of foreboding anger.

This is just my interpretation of the things I found appealing about this piece. It is my opinion which is completely subjective. It is my attempt at a candid analysis of your piece.

"Correct. The composition, posing, colour, and focus makes the selfie with the cats art.

Which, to be as pedantic as you are dismissive, is what makes a bathroom selfie for onlyfans art as well.

I think it's pretty great composition. I could take or leave the nipple slip. The intense stare is much more captivating and the cats create some interest. I'll ape some other criticisms of the lighting. I think a diagonal shading from top right to bottom left would help make a nice contrast from a beauty in bloom and her feline friends in shadow.  and it lines up well with the lines already in the shot.

"I could care less about the nipple, but the artists whole m.o. are images of women in various stages of undress depicting some scene.  If that is how she wants to produce her images more power to her! These images are infinitely better than the majority of the NSFW ""art"" photos on the site. I like the subject of the composition but I do not feel particularly moved by this image compared to the artists other works.

The couch taking up 1/4 of the image I find very jarring, the color and texture of the couch is a nice match to the atmosphere of the work.  I think if the lighting could be harsher on the subject if that is what she was going for to create a more dynamic look. However, that is not the normal type of lighting for women subjects.  My 2nd biggest gripe are the cats... they are out of focus while the wall and main subject are in focus. Maybe that is the goal, and I am completely missing the point.

'The crow cawed and tapped on the top-most stone of the larger cairn. A gust of wind rippled the dark red cloaks attached to the burial mounds, before rushing down the hill. In the valley below the grass began to whisper. The crow resumed its insistent tapping.

A cloud, meandering across the wide, blue sky, briefly obscured the sun. When it left there was a man on the hill. He turned to the crow. ""Thank you.

One, not everything included has to be necessary, nor will everything included ever be. I see this critique used more often for film than photographs, but I think the counter still stands.

Weird because I‚Äôve had multiple black women contact me because of this photo asking for photo shoots because they love the way l captured the glow of the makeup on her skin. I have 3 booked next week. Also the photo is supposed to be moody. I advertise artistically and moody photography. Something that sets a scene. I don‚Äôt do overly lit modeling photos.,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1a1FSNTRjRDR0SzBtRXNhb1gxV25uSW12Q2ZsR3ZuaTJGTHVKUmtTeHh4TGRmaUQzU0ZrTVd3MURwUHl3N3BkcnU2d3ctcFBEcWd2dlUwcWFDTlVOVnExQ2VRcm5kb1hCUF9yVzVxMkNFVTg9
"I hate how sexualized everything has become as in how her nipple immediately has to be assigned a sexual component instead of just being part of her body. That said, no I don‚Äôt agree with you because it‚Äôs a socially relative sexualization of an arbitrary body part. If we all suddenly fetishized noses the same way then people would be up in arms about how her nostrils ‚Äòdon‚Äôt add anything‚Äô to the piece, and I‚Äôd have the same argument.

And I also don‚Äôt think the awareness of the subject detracts from the candidness. It looks like a private photo one might take of their wife one day while the two lounge on the couch - the uneasiness of nudity having fallen by the wayside a long time ago, no more noteworthy than one‚Äôs own nudity. She‚Äôs looking at the camera, but she‚Äôs not making any sort of sexual expression - she‚Äôs literally just sitting there with an impassive look on her face.

"Different strokes, but I'm looking at this on a large monitor and can barely make out the features of her face. It doesn't read as moody, just indistinct. I'm glad you're getting work, but I don't think this lighting is doing anything to convey a mood or tell a story. Just makes it hard to see.

"A powerful druid from our D&D campaigns in Theomachy!

**Character: Vitalia** **the Evergreen, Wood Elf Druid**

Vitalia was just a child when the forces of Gorg, the God of War, set the ancient forest of Sylendil ablaze, destroying her home. A kind-hearted imperial commander found her hiding among the smoldering ruins of a wood elf village and took her to Vandis, the imperial capital, where she was put to work as one of the many gardeners in the capital‚Äôs noble courts.

Vitalia grew up tending the emperor‚Äôs perfectly sculpted gardens, grateful towards her saviors, but longing the wild and untamed forest she had lost. She became a beautiful, if not demure, woman, and made many good friends among other servants. In secret, she continued to pray to Mother Nature as she did as a child in the forest, and not to the new gods that watched over the Empire.

Years passed, her friends grew old, emperors rose and fell, and court ladies withered like springtime flowers under the summer sun. But Vitalia remained unchanged to the eyes of aging human nobles as she worked on the emperor‚Äôs gardens. Everyone thought Vitalia was just a quiet relic from the past.

Then one day the imperial court woke up to a shocking surprise. Overnight, the Emperor‚Äôs perfectly sculpted gardens had been transformed into a wild, untamed forest and Vitalia was nowhere to be found. Everyone thought she had gone forever.

Yet, when a noble knight was sent to investigate the mysterious appearance of a new forest to the north of the imperial capital, he found Vitalia. She was confident, if not defiant, as she danced in the forest of her childhood, now born again through the power of the reawakened Mother Nature.

**About the Theomachy setting:**

In Theomachy, vengeful gods fight each other for ultimate control of the universe, while the mortals of Naam struggle for power on a dying world. Divine magic is a force without expressed will that the warring gods hoard and wield against each other, threatening to undo the entire world. Clerics and paladins are either devout followers of the warring gods or theomachists who fight against the gods, liberating divine magic and using it against them.

"ex Cinere
(""From Ashes"")
A shaft of sunlight pierces the dusty air, a divine spotlight illuminating the potter's wheel. There, born from the earth's embrace and shaped by human hands, a vessel stands in silent perfection. Yet, the path to this creation is etched in the shadows that surround it. The kiln's fiery womb has witnessed countless misshapen forms, imperfect experiments that, like the mythical phoenix, have risen from their own ashes to inform this moment of triumph. In the distance, a window frames the golden sunrise, a testament to the relentless cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal.
For every masterpiece, there exist countless trials, each a stepping stone towards mastery. The journey of the artisan is a dance with imperfection, a constant striving for form amidst the formless. Just as the potter molds clay, so too do we shape our lives, learning from our failures, refining our craft with each attempt. Embrace the ""opus ex cinere"" within you, for it is in the fiery crucible of adversity that our true potential is forged. Let the broken pieces of your past fuel the flames of your creativity, and from the ashes of your missteps, may you rise anew, reborn and refined, ready to craft a life of beauty and purpose.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY3dV9jTzFXaURqdDRGSTl1ZGhBbWVXMnN3djREUEF2eU9fc05kZWZ1Q3lmZkFPOWFNdlJPMU5adEpua2s1UzU2aTlHWkR5bnMyVjFfWnhrTThNN1BrdGc9PQ==

"AI murders art and the spirit in the creative endevour. In many ways creativity can be reinterpreted and infiltrate various  evolving genres of expression (music, visual arts graphic arts, cooking etc). We do need to move forward with what ever methods and tools.

But

AI is all about replacement not progress or some new egress in surpassing any  intimate human experience.  It's just the advancment of our adventures in technological illusion(s) and mimicry. More primarily as a TOOL. It's goal in creation is efficiency in product only. Efficiency in human production and replacing human skill, labour, style and even idea. The very core tenets of any worthy creative task by human heads and hands.

"It was a different time. I was in college as a pre-med but wanting to explore different fields. I took a 2d concept designs course and we worked exclusively with paper. The project was learning values through recreating our favorite albums covers. Kanye wasn't as controversial as a figure as he is today (by controversial I mean a piece of shit) and this was one of my favorite albums so far. It is still a beautifully produced album regardless of how awful he is (and he is uniquely awful with hindsight). I took a lot of inspiration from Andr√© Derain's portrait of Matisse. Thank you and I hope you enjoy.

Edit: while not the most technical or unique, it is still a time capsule of a different era and a snapshot of my frame of mind.

"Hey all! Sorry thought I commented on this earlier. 

This was a digital study for a painting I plan on working on soon. That said, I really loved how it turned out. My work plays with identity, structure, and process. I find beauty in the process and I love to let it shine through. 

Identity and censorship is something I can never get away from in my work. There is something thought provoking about a censored face with more fully rendered genitals in the same work. The censorship for the face is a bright yellow to bring attention to this idea.

"Excellent. Very evocative and emotional illustration. I especially love the left most hearts. While very metaphorical it is a clear and good illustration of things like pain, despair, sorrow, or just feeling like falling apart.

Stylistically the motives are strong and the use of colour really works, especially the use of black and how it comes across as almost uncontrollable.

"Thank you /u/alairebowen! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

"The painting is inspired by the famous Japanese scene the ""Great Wave off Kanagawa"" and this was my take on it. Usually it is represented in a very traditional Japanese style, I however wanted to try something different, using Japanese blue indigo, and more emphasis on depth of color and shading. For the Hour markers, I had to extract them from 2 donor dials that came from 1970's Seiko LM watches. Being over 50 years old, they were in rough shape, but I loved their contours, so I decided to sand, polish, gold plate them, and finally to mirror polish.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdFS280Rkl2cGE0emk5ZVZodG1KcHNyaTBvak5lRGZqX2RoMHFNdGFZTlNJUGdEMnRZMU1zQmhzNlZxd1BqSXZJTGVyRnR1MTM1ekg4anNtbmYzdHBQS0E9PQ==

"Thank you /u/Cartoon73! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

"I think its all political?... a man in a blue suit and long red tie on a smart phone (tweeting?)... I wonder who that could be, anyway he has no head, that much is obvious.

A depiction on a mid-century tv set of a ""cowboy"" headed to the left. Can't really tell but it doesn't look like the cowboy has white skin as most tv/movie ""cowboys"" were, when in reality probably not.

A group of cartoonish and small men/militia thinking they are going to be of use against a much larger force from under a pink sky head their way while some of their group desert their elevated position (not-so-moral high ground) which is depicted at the very lowest point of the composition.

"As much as I dislike Trump, you are correct and it isn't the only time shit has been made up about him and duly accepted as truth by the left. I say this as an ardent leftist, I just have a quasi-autistic need not to fall for misinformation.

A most recent example: Near the end of the Theo Von interview he looks off-camera to one of his aides then back to Theo and mouths something. I've seen a fair number of people claim he was mouthing ""please"" or similar things, pleading for Theo to stop the interview.

All I can see is ""I have time"" which lends itself to an entirely different narrative.

Another recent one was during a speech he was giving where people were losing their minds over him supposedly saying ""I'm not Christian"" when, to me, it seems obvious he's saying ""I'm *a* Christian"" - It's just the way he says it and people's biases that started the incorrect interpretation.

The piles of down votes I've received on the occasions I've pointed out these mistakes will obviously never change how I feel about the guy and the republican party as a whole, I just sometimes feel disheartened at people's lack of critical thought and know that it just gives conservatives ammunition - which is something I'd rather not do.

"I appreciate your comment. You are correct, there is a lot of misinformation about Trump that is spread on Reddit as well as the main stream media. This is not surprising with the leader of the Democrats, Harris, constantly lying in her speeches about Trump wanting a national abortion ban (he doesn't) and his affiliation with project 2025 (there is none). Or the previous leader, Biden, rehashing the lies of ""good people on both sides"" and ""suckers and losers"". 

I also appreciate anyone who is willing to get ostracized by the community for correcting lies about someone they do not support.

"Malaysia oddly has many varieties of vampires. Here, 4 of the most popular are described. Some folklore as below: 

1/ Pontianak - the quintessential vampire of the Malaysian Archipelago. Classically a beautiful long haired, red eyed, woman-like spirit that typically drinks the blood of hapless men. Interestingly the name derives from the word pohon which means tree in Malay. Some folklore even state they like to reside in banana palms during the day. While often dressed in white, my Pontianak thinks a black dress contrasts better with her pale skin. 

2/ Langsuir/Langsuyar - often mistaken for the more famous Pontianak. Though often associated with owls or other birds of prey, sometimes even transforming into one. They‚Äôre unique in the sense that they drink blood from a hole from the nape of their neck. My Langsuyar is self conscious of the cervical orifice and prefers to keep it covered up.

3/ Menanaggal/ Penanggalan - the infamous horrifying looking vampire that preys on the blood of pregnant women and newborns. The Malaysian variety is usually depicted as a floating head with entrails while the Indonesian and Philippine versions often have their torsos. My Menanaggal is just happy to have friends who don‚Äôt mind her quirkiness. 

4/ Toyol - a rather popular ghoul that derives from aborted fetuses imbued with animistic dark magic. The little goblins are often known to steal gold and shiny jewelry. But notoriously many types of Toyol need to be sated with a meal of blood by their owners. Failure to do so would result in the creature attacking their owners instead. My Toyol is more than happy with his bling.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPcXp4TlI5MF9lZnU5TEx6ay1NRVVwV1RRMkQwUXpFbDgxYkxDWVQ4dmJLNDN3S2hqR19CZlpQWUFYZWFfMkNoV3ozVnpVd1ZIYnR2TENCLWUtaVRzNDJ6M2lBNnZBQ2dhU1FncjFibzRsR009

That's cause anytime anyone tries to make a face that's different a digital riot occurs for example Spiderman 2 game changed Mary Jane's face slightly and people starting harrassing not only Sony but the acual real life model for Mary Jane. It got to a point where the model actually quit her job due to the constant backlash and online harrasment cause her face had changed slightly due to an accident that had affected her jaw. It's not that artist want to make the same face it's that they know people who are online attack anything that isn't similar.,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdQdHYtUWN2N0twbVFONm5lV3Vhb29BOUVPc0doTVd5bWVUNmo4YTdYeDM3ZWd5bUIwdmFsRWFTUHFuRmdvdzFZLTNWeDdQQUxPM2xpM3B2UzRDcXFURTJZa1BEbXNtN1ZtOVloQ1hZX0E1RDA9

"Here's the deal. I quit drinking and started reading after work. I looked at what's on mine ‚ÄúI'll read later‚Äù list. After looking through the titles, I remembered that I liked the movie ‚ÄúLet Me In‚Äù (2008) even when I was a kid. And some time ago, I found out that it was based on a book by Jon Lindqvist. In general, I have a new addition to my list of favorite books. Almost always the book is better than the movie, but here the movie was very good, and the book turned out to be a masterpiece. I'll check out the author's other works later. To be honest, I wrote a three-page review of this book. (always do that). But it's not customary to post it here. Just advise everyone, a great book, if you liked the movie, a must read.

"Vitiligo is¬†**a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disorder that causes patches of skin to lose pigment or color**.

"This is what I got from that:

""She smiled at him with all the love in the world as she drew closer. He inhaled her perfume and his mind flickered erratically across their life together, Paris at the tower, London overlooking the bridge, a hot steamy night in Kairo just next to the pyramids, a cold cabin in Finland, mornings, evenings, everything. His lips moved closer to hers as he kissed her in the most gentle way he could. She answered his kiss as she momentarily stiffened up. Then she pulled back and her loving smile became angelically radiant.

He swallowed hard, a tear forming in the corner of his left eye. Her eyes glazed over a bit as she teared up and whispered, 'No guilt dear, no guilt. You were always the quick on the uptake' before she went limp in his arms and her knife clattered against the klinker floor. 

He gently withdrew his own dagger from her back as he carefully laid her to rest on the bed they'd spent their last two weeks on. He'd known for over a month, but he hadn't been able to bring himself to do it. He drew a deep shaking breath as he looked down at his dagger. Then he dried his tears and put it back in the concealed holster. It had been nice to feel like a normal person for a half a year, but as everyone knew in the community, the day you ignore reality is when it comes knocking on your door. 

He exhaled and nodded to himself.

Because it isn‚Äôt good. ‚ÄúBut why?‚Äù is the most important question.  They‚Äôre being nice. A: models are not arranged well.  Needs Contraposto in all three models echoing known themes to tie the image together.B:  Simple colors lead the design. How does each relate to ‚Äúthe graces‚Äù ? Each one is a different grace. What qualities do they represent ? Are they successful? What would you change? Why? Lighting? Scale ? Background? Why? to every question. Then ‚Äúdid it work?‚Äù And start all ovrt. Art is a job.

"You have a professional outlook and that's valid. Not sure if OP is doing it for business or not, I like the creative randomness of it. The reason I clicked this post was to find out why they titled it ""Paradox"". From a business perspective, it could've been powerful to leave the title mysterious to the viewer.

I don't value that much personally, art can be exciting when left completely open to the imagination with no ""guide"" on where it should take you. It's a multifaceted discipline. Some practice it for money, others for expression. It is not clear (even to the artist) what their work represents or the affect it will have. I guess everyone has different priorities.

"Take ""Starry Night"" by Van Gogh, for example. The title is simple and appropriate. It doesn‚Äôt really change the emotions or sensory reactions the viewer might have.

"It's from the video-game, 'Unakis'. It's essentially an amalgamation that is keeping order in a treacherous land that's prone to corruption from the influence of an event that has happened in the past. It's the final boss of the game.

It's very old, and its 'head' is melting while the heart above (its soul) disintegrates with the passage of time, but mostly when it becomes active to restore order. It does this by removing the pillars around it, and opening the giant coffin that's its body. This coffin creates a heat wave after sitting open for long enough, causing mass destruction for the sake of preserving the land from 'scarring/blackness' (essentially land that's permanently rendered to disintegrate any life on it.)

Yes, it is obvious that is how it'd work, but i wasn't sure. (on account of reuploads and such)


Im not asking the artist or ""museum"" to ""take down"" their work

Im haply for them if they keep posting. It's just boring and in my opinion insists upon itself. It's the same hook every time, and I'm bored of seeing it.

I only wanted to know if I could turn it off for myself, not others. I don't give the slightest care what other people do. Keep loving it and up voting it if that's what you want.

Im not in any way knocking the artist, it is good work forreal. I hope they continue it. It's just not for me. And it pops up SO much tot he point that I almost feel like it's spam/bots. I didn't even realize the OP was the actual artist. Which is why I asked my question.


If the OP is the artist, I could block them and not see new posts. But I'd still have to deal with reuploads from bots/reposters. So, that sucks.

"Yeah I get it. That's why I answered your question and confirmed for you. Glad we're all on the same page now.

Idk why this has been such a ridiculously long and heated conversation about something so basic but here we are. I have zero issues if you block them or not. I don't care if you love them but want a break from seeing them or you hate them and wish they'd quit art. My only point outside of confirming for you that that's how block works is that telling an artist you're bored of them is a bit rude (since your comment goes to their inbox).

If you had had the young woman walking away at an angle, i.e. toward the viewer but to the right or left, it would have changed the instinctual interpretation. Something looking or moving toward the viewer is always going to come across as confrontational or personal, because humans are reactionary to things that seemingly involve themselves. This is why people always seem to think portaits are looking at them, despite their position relative to the photo.

Garden Of Earthly Delights, portion of Hell Panel, ""The Prince Of Hell"", oil on oak c. 1490 - 1510, Hieronymous Bosch.Born circa 1450 in Den Bosch, Brabant, a former state of the Holy Roman Empire, now the Netherlands, Hieronymous Bosch, real name Jerome Van Aken, quickly rose to fame during the Renaissance with his highly detailed insights to the human condition and keen ability to portray humanity's desires and deepest fears. Though many consider Hieronymous to be a pioneer of surrealism, he was, in fact, an Early Netherlandish Renaissance Realist, and a very talented one, who inspired such surrealist artists as Peter Bruegel the Elder, Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, and Salvador Dali. His depictions of unnatural plant life, grotesque animals, and varying degrees of human forms were mostly highly creative imagined depictions of the bible, where he transformed the stories contained within into visual works in a proto-cinematic presentation. GOED, which was painted some time between 1490 and 1510, is a triptych, a 3 paneled hinged art piece depicting the Garden of Eden, Earth, and Hell. It was capable of obscuring the figures within, as many of these types of works were used as altarpieces, and only opened on days of special meaning. As this is an enormous and highly detailed painting, this is but a small piece of the third panel, which depicts Hell, and the damnation of all those who have sinned in the various acts of torture and defilement. This image, which is known colloquially as the ""Prince of Hell"" due to his makeshift debased cooking pot crown, has always stuck with me since my very first viewing. Since we do not know what his interpretations are supposed to be, everything is left to the imagination. My kind of painting. Enjoy.

"Your execution is excellent. I love the idea of literally intertwining these visual themes together, and the usage of figurative form inside, being collaged together but also dissolved apart -- it's thought-provoking.

My only constructive criticism is that I would love to see more color and pattern purposefulness between the subject matter from work to work. Titles serve to orient us, the viewers, to the mood and attitude of the artwork, but color, shape, and line also echo these ideas.

What invokes a feeling of ""unraveling""? I can see what direction you're headed in, but I would personally love to see you ""push"" it further in palette selections and more nuanced image collage. 

Not saying you don't consider these aspects, just suggesting that you can practice more restraint in selection and possibly more flexibility from traditional palettes... all of your pieces that I peeked at seem to blend together in the thumbnails, so more ""umph"" in distinction could lend more potency to each individual piece's message.

"**Angels and Demons ‚Äì D&D Characters**

An epic party of angels and demons in disguise plus a half-angel I drew! made two versions of them, one without and one with Horns and Halos!

The heroes from left to right:

‚Ä¢ Azarel Hadad, Half-Angel Fighter and Forge Cleric

‚Ä¢ Joey Baker (Jophiel Dreamvision), Angel Slayer

‚Ä¢ Pavo Adatta, Demon Hexblade Warlock and Paladin of Vengeance

‚Ä¢ Lucivar, Demon Life Cleric of Lilith

‚Ä¢ Polyporales 'Poly' Willock (Pazzbet), Demon Spore Druid

‚Ä¢ Zuriel Moonsong, Angel Librarian and Knowledge Cleric

‚Ä¢ Selina Argent (Argazul), Demon Bard, Sorceress, and Ambassador

Azarel is a practical, dedicated, and tireless fighter and blacksmith. He puts not only a spark of creativity into the armor he crafts, but also some genuine regard for the safety of the future wearer. He thinks that in a world in which so much of one's fate cannot be controlled, the best one can do is protect oneself and one's loved ones. He and Joey are half-brothers.

Joey, also known as the ‚ÄúSpy of God‚Äù, is an angel who grew up almost totally among humans. He might be a slayer, but his day job is drummer of a band. He is trendy, brash, confident, and easygoing, and also has a pet owl. He and Azarel are half-brothers.

Pavo serves two masters. As a warlock, her powers come from Mephistopheles and has recently become a paladin of Lilith as well. They both allow her to work for the other, but Pavo knows there might be political intrigue and hidden conflicts going on. Pavo carries an enormous sword with an obsidian blade.

Lucivar is a cleric of Lilith, the Demon Lord of Wrath, who has tasked her to help Pavo on her journey in Lilith‚Äôs service. She also secretly tracks the party‚Äôs movements and reports directly to her goddess through a magic scroll.

Poly is an agender druid who loves mushrooms and spending time in the wilderness. They are easily recognizable thanks to their hat with mushrooms growing on it. Poly has recently awakened and adopted a squirrel.

Zuriel is a heavenly librarian who got mixed up in a scandal that led to his eventual expulsion from heaven, though he did nothing wrong. Now, she prefers to stay on Atma, the world of mortals, though his knowledge of the plane is purely theoretical. Zuriel is exceptionally handsome and wears a pendant to appear plainer and attract less attention.

Selina is an ambitious and attractive demon ambassador who was sent to Atma to secretly influence human society. Having lived long among humans, she admittedly enjoys life among them, but she always knows that she could, if she wanted, twist any of them around her little finger. She is always seen in the most distinguished outfits.

"It's definitely not a highly realistic piece, but that's where it's fascinating to see everyone's subjective interpretations and imaginations. Seeing an Easter color palette is one of many cool takes on the piece.

Reading other people's reactions to my pieces really adds depth and appreciation when I view my own work, even though I'm certain of the artist's intent lol. Like it's fun to see how differently we can view what might objectively be the same piece, it can be consterning when someone sees a dick or something lol but still interesting (although these really plague me specifically)

"Thank you for taking the time to explore my art. The idea behind my work is that you never see everything at once‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something new to discover each time you look. This is my first time showcasing my art on an art board, though I've shared it with a few people over the years.

The feedback I've often received focuses on the absence of color or a specific theme. Some have even suggested that my work lacks imagination, encouraging me to stop doodling and focus on drawing ""real"" pictures.

I want to explain a bit about my process and the nature of my art. I have a condition called aphantasia, which means I don't have a ""mind's eye""‚ÄîI can't visualize images in my head. As a result, my artwork isn't based on imagined scenes or detailed mental pictures. Instead, my pieces emerge from random thoughts and moods, guiding the art organically.

These creations often take months to complete, and I'm currently working on a piece that is four times larger than my usual work.

">I mean I'm more asking if he looks like a Warrior

Then the answer is no. It looks like you have explained what a character looks like to someone over the phone and asked them to draw it, without them having no other context to go off. And no amount of spiky hair will change that.

Also, the head is the wrong proportions too. It needs to be bigger to fit the frame of body. As it is, you have drawn a small worried looking boy on to Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Again, rather than just at other peoples pictures and trying to copy them, look at what inspired the artist to make those design choices. Go five layers deep if you have to. 

Just to be clear, you have a creative spark here and it's not my intention to extinguish anyone who tries something new. But understanding creative sources does make the difference from being a generic interpretation to a unique interpretation in character design.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZMF9uMVZzdlBsX2RUY0JtX3UxZkp0V1dDMjhwZ01oOG1OWVdmb0xyMjNfSGNaUFNkc3ZyenFfXzRGRlZ1SFIwdk8xYUk0aFhGUG9hVDh4RjQwcnFmaGc9PQ==

"There doesn't need to be perfect, 100% concrete evidence for something in order for it to be reasonable to conclude that it's true. That's one of the most basic theories of statistics.

It's known that someone fired in his direction with a gun which is not particularly accurate, because the gun was identified, shots were fired, and several people behind Trump were shot, one of whom died. The shooting was caught on video & there was a slight amount of visible blood, as would be expected. Bullet casings were found on the ground as well. Saying ""no concrete evidence"" at this point is just demonstrating your irrationality.

Deliberately having someone fire a gun as inaccurate as the one used in his general direction would put Trump in serious danger.

"So what is it. Stop skating around and just say it. Or do you not know either?   
Because I'm not going to look it up, I have an expert right in front of me, right?

This whole conversation is stupid. You made a claim and in reaponse to my criticism of it have done nothing to back it up. You call me out on not knowing what constitutes evidence and are not willing to provide anything.

1, this was a psyop to drum up support for Republicans, requiring someone to fire at and kill a stranger and many, many officers and secret service personnel to be complicit in the scheme. Or:   
2, so deranged dipshit got luck and took a potshot and missed.

No.

You need to provide proof, at this point anything else is simply whataboutisms, you Fox news wannabe.   
At this point I should stop asking for evidence of Trumps shooting being a false flag and instead ask you to prove you aren't being paid of as a scapegoat by Russia as a shining example of ""Leftists,"" with all the derogatory intonation that could be placed upona word.

"What type of evidence do you want?

I am not avoiding answering you, I just want to make sure that my time invested in this will not be a waste, as I suspect it will be should I choose to do this.

Don't just say ""concrete"" or I will block you, I want a description of the type of evidence you would consider to be concrete evidence in this case. 

Otherwise, I will find evidence, then you will say it isn't concrete, then I will find more, and you will keep saying it isn't concrete.

Set the bar, and I will give you the evidence, or agree that such evidence does not exist.

"Ding ding, we have a ~~Winner~~ oh wait, more whattaboutisms.

Oh well, you tried, but you just can't say what your evidence is, can you.   
You've really learned a lot from Fox, haven't you? Just keep repeating the same nonsense and ignore anything that you don't like.   
I gotta know, is this the only way for you to get someone to pay attention to you? Arguing with strangers on reddit?   
Because anyone with even a shred of self respect would have figured out by now that the only point of this is the interaction. There are no lessions yo be learnt here, noone is watching with great interest, no followers to be had.

Just You

And Me.

Its kinda sad, really. That you are even sticking around anymore.   
You can't prove a point, you don't even have any clue what you could present to me as evidence anyway. And I know that's because you don't have any, you just have suspicions, you conspiratorial child you.   
Does anyone in your life even care about what you think? Does anyone stick around when you start babbling about the shooter, and the PsyOp, oh, I bet you believe that there is someone planning all this behind the scenes, don't you?

Go ahead, why don't you tell me about the secret group doing assassinations, because acording to you they did, right? That guy who died was killed on purpose after all.

Come one, hit me with your best shot. Give me something to really blow my mind about how you know that this was all a secret plot.

I'll wait, because you are just a joke to me. Not even a real person. Because I've seen better arguments from a chatbot.

So I paint from top to bottom, left to right. That is ""green apple scented Dawn"" and when I started this painting I had a different bulb in the main kitchen light.

"I did, in fact, look it up. As best as I can tell, you are demanding ""undeniable evidence.""

The problem with ""undeniable evidence"" is that ""undeniable"" is not specific. Nothing in life is absolutely certain. Even the statement that the earth will rotates 1 time relative to the sun in the next 24 hours is not absolutely certain. If that is your standard, there is no concrete evidence JFK got shot either.

However, if ""concrete evidence"" means that a reasonable person would have little reason to deny it, there is absolutely concrete evidence in this case. Video proof, spent bullet casings, a known shooter, a known weapon, *and the fact that someone else in the line of fire was killed*.

"Thank you /u/NightcrawlerLad! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

Do not [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FArt) until you have read the full rules!   Most of the time the answers are in there, and if you haven't bothered to do your research, we will not be helpful.

Remember, removals are never personal, and occasionally in error, so **polite** inquiries may be answered in kind.  Impolite inquiries may get you a permanent ban and will be reported to the admins for harassment.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1S05aM0NFRVkwM3hQMkFqMVg3bmk0b1ZMb3U1NUFvQ0o3THl4MUU5bVlXUVljOEM1ZXBZdm94S3h6VDMtRHJHOFRMTzVpYldBdkp6MHdnUjlYdmZKdVE9PQ==

"Very nice, emotional and expressive sculpture. The anatomical accuracy as well as the realism of the pose and gestures makes it almost disturbing.

"Thank you /u/bryguy54! for your submission! Unfortunately, your post has been removed for the following reason(s):

***It breaks rule 7:*** **No fanart, comics, or requests.**  Please consider posting to /r/fanart  instead. 

Images of actual people are fine: actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, celebrities, etc.  So, for example, a portrait of Heath Ledger is OK, but not a portrait of Heath Ledger as The Joker.  You may post in /r/fanart or one of the other large subs like /r/movies, /r/television, /r/comics, or /r/pics, or a sub dedicated to that subject. The [ImaginaryNetwork](http://reddit.com/r/ImaginaryNetwork) has a ton of fandom subs that your work may fit in as well.

For more information about the subreddit rules make sure to read the sidebar, and if you have any questions please feel free to reply to this comment. Thank you!

"A unique blood hunter I drew!

Character: **Falk, Human Blood Hunter**

Falk is the first of three children, born into a wealthy family. From a young age, his father tried to drill him, forcing him to learn etiquette, study, and train in sword fighting. This overwhelmed the young boy so much so that after every mistake, failure, or any kind of disapproval from his father he grew more and more insecure about himself.

After an incident at only twelve years of age, he hurt his leg so bad that even after fully healing Falk still feels pain, likely caused by a fear trauma after his father beat him for breaking his leg. After that, Falk was largely ignored and grew more and more reclusive and depressed, becoming constantly annoyed, grumpy, cynic, and sarcastic. After the incident, his father would go on to make more children to replace Falk, first a daughter and then a second son.

Now after more years of loneliness and as much training as he could, he has left behind his family to find a place in the world for himself. Even with no hope, he still goes on.

"""Promissio,"" a painting depicting the interior of a Waffle House bathed in the approaching dawn, is a reflection on human hope and resilience. It invites viewers to contemplate the countless promises made within those humble walls as night yields to day.

"""creative licences for dramatic and artistic effect.""  
Yeah, sure, as alwasy it's ""their style"".  For some reason ai looking style with artifacts that ai does,  and mistakes that somebody sane wouldn't do.  Even ert of people with mental ilnesses makes more sense from a technical point of view.  
 And no proofs that they did it intentionally for some reason.  
 Idk, maybe people lack visual experience of how ai images look in details or they don't draw and don't understand the process which can't lead to a result like this.  
  Once again, look at the neck for example. 1st it absolutely does look like ai slop. 2nd can you imagine someone deliberatly drawing bones like this? When random part of them appear from nowhere, blend into other random bones or just dissolve in the air? And all that covered with random lines?  Like, is you know what you are drawing, why makint it look like you've seen it once?  
 These three lines on the left side of the neck where ai didn't know what it should have to draw, hair, neck silhouette or another hai? Which is suspiciously followe by random unnecessary line on the jaw bone. Because that's what ai does. It just follow patterns without understanding what it is unlike a real human.

"I personally feel a different title would be more impactful. 

Something a long the lines of finding a rose in the dark

Suffering? That's too intense. This is too graceful for suffering. Suffering is dark.  it's not pretty, it's not something people enjoy looking at. 

To portray suffering you must confront the audience with an undeniable, indelible image of suffering. I dare say- you must disturb us

This? This is some goth chick that stole tuxedo mask's rose

Don't get me wrong tho This is a sick piece. Dark yet detailed and the red is subtle yet its presence pops. Draws the eye. And the woman is so graceful and her aura seems to be flowing. Liquid, frozen motion. Cool

""A Dark Reprieve"" or something like that seems more fitting. Maybe a Silent Reprieve?  Maybe just a Gertrude Stein quote is enough 

Again, just personal opinion. I'm just an idiot on the internet",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FjMm1Ram9QRHU1TndqT2FsZklzQXQ0cVR6STlRRGEzS0FOaURyVzFBbGdvZm1HbFlhY2RnSHA4VWF2Vkw2RlRxenFkQ2M1VnNkV2NFcmhDVkM4bUc3RnRXTW9wcHEteHVmNmFIa2VadmJ5VkU9

The distorted shadow of the figure really gives the lighting a certain instability I think is rad, especially with the way the angel‚Äôs wings encompass the illuminated area in center of the drawing.

"No problem!¬† Just making it clear.¬† Maybe in the future put (me) in the title.


Anyhow have some comments.¬† First off, I like, especially the play on light, and the overarching composition.


While of course all interpretations are up to the observer (so, take with a grain of salt), my feedback would be: it has senses of stillness and movement that conflict with each other, and I'm not huge on the palette of the figure laying down.¬† Also, the sizes feel... Not quite right (taking into account that this could reflect both a stylistic choice, and a play on the emotional perspective of one of the two people in the work itself), for example her right hand seems disproportionate with respect to the rest of the work.

"To give some context to this shoot, this is Bobby West a musician from Liverpool. He had written a song called Joanne. 

Bobby used to work in a steel mill and had a work colleague that would always leave early from social events and always want to get back to his wife Joanne. Sadly he passed away and Bobby went to his family home with flowers and condolences for Joanne, only to discover that Joanne was this guys alter ego. He decided to write a song about it and wanted the photoshoot to be his transition into Joanne. It‚Äôs a series of photos this being the second image. The painting in the back to point to the future. In the first image of him as a man there is a picture of a young Bobby in the background of the boy he was to the woman he will become.

"I have been following your progress with your paintings for a while and am constantly suprised with how you manage to still add even more amazing techniques to your composition.
I was amazed when i first saw your lovely scratching techniques for the skies, then you started doing works with cool clouds and terrain made out of thick pallette knife blotches and i didnt think you could really innovate more from there.

But now you have added some kind of contrasting triangular lines that act like little abstract spotlights, and i dont even know how you would have done those with how everything else was laid out.

"Hmm if you are serious about art, critique will come whether you ask for it or not. Agreeing with the one person who sides with you and dismissing all other comments won‚Äôt get you very far. Some comments were on the rude side, but do you want to defend a piece by making up scenarios in your favour (ie. ‚Äòmaybe she‚Äôs on a hill and there are buildings below) or simply take the critique for what it is, an honest judgment of what other people see when they look at this. Learn from it, and on your next piece you can simply appreciate the feed back. 

Try not to side with the one ‚Äòfuck everyone else‚Äô comment or only the ‚Äònice‚Äô ones‚Ä¶It holds you to ‚Äòyah!

"She wasn‚Äôt an advocate of people remaining in poverty, rather that our focus should be on Heavenly goods.  She herself (and her sisters) chose to be poor like the people they administered to.  She ran a hospice.  Hospice is for the dying.  It‚Äôs like when the doctor tells someone they have 6 months to live.  There‚Äôs nothing to be done.  She strove to give them a compassionate death surrounded by people who loved them.  Because of the cast system in India at the time, the poorest people were considered less than dirt.  Untouchable.  She literally went and picked dying people up off the street and gave them a bed and as much care as she could give.  They freely gave out as much medicine and pain killers as they could, but these things were gifts to her and her sisters.  So if they ran out, there was none to give out.  If anyone wanted to give money to the poor, she would accept it.  It didn‚Äôt matter who it was from.  It was going to help the dying.  She sought no attention for herself and constantly turned down opportunities to give speeches and rub elbows with the rich because she thought her duty was to be with the poor and help them.  When she was given the Nobel prize for peace, she melted it down and sold it.  She was an amazing woman.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTmowTlJKSGtPbjVaY2x6SnlERWdfRHloN0dTeHBodVlkd3EyV2NTZFY2WUNDT1RhejYwZUlfMmZDdWV6N19yQTNsdFRudkI1cnFnNVJxQWFBelp1UkE9PQ==

"the artist‚Äôs perspective is what if mother teresa was a war maker. 

he also had other peaceful personalities like gandhi with a bazooka in miami where he was asking what if gandhi chose violence instead of peace and non-violence.

in case of mother teresa, the take is misinformed. she was an evil person. she got billions of dollars in the 80s and 90s and funneled it all to one of the most corrupt banks in the vatican where a lot of bad people send money to wash it.

all this money which she got in the name of helping the poor never reached any poor people. the poor died in pain and with sub-human treatment where her only purpose was to trick them into accepting jesus christ as their savior and convert them into christians. she wouldn‚Äôt even give them painkillers let alone any proper meds apart from basic first aid even if they were suffering from extreme health conditions and she had proper access to cures, she‚Äôd let them die.

among her other acts of evil, she wrote a letter to a judge in california presiding over a case where a priest/director of a church was caught sexually abusing children for years. the judge dropped the case and the man continued his heinous crimes for another decade.  

she also was very controlling of the nuns who used to volunteer there. she used to not let them wear anything except fully covered sarees and used to make them work for more than 12 hours a day, all days of the week. she used to keep them from meeting their families and made them abstain from any kind of sexual acts.

One debunk easy to summarise was that Mother Theresa refused to give strong pain relief. The lack of pain relief was down to rationing in those days, law and doctors who were licensed to administer the medication doing it voluntarily and so only being available some weekends.

"I asked about the word ""save"" since many would use it to refer to saving souls. Very well, that was not your intent.

But what did she do to prevent or alive illness and disease? She had soup kitchens and hospices. In the later, they kind of just prayed over people that were dying.

For the amount of money that went to her charities, how much soup made it into anyone's bellies?

At best, she ran a wasteful and corrupt charity that primarily benefited the Catholic church and her own order. To be fair, lots of charities around the world (most certainly including in the US) are just as corrupt and ineffective but they should all be called out for their deceptions as well.

Besides, what should someone have done? Throw packets of condoms around, telling the dying children their parents should have used those, then walk away because clearly, Mother Theresa was a monster and they were better off dying on the streets?

Hitchens, who famously miss-quotes, wrote a non-academic book with hardly any sources to back his claims, only his famous anti-religion ideology that required him to paint all religions as evil, did nothing to help them. Infact, no-one else before Mother Theresa had done anything to help.

"Ignoring the fact that we don't really have numbers and figures to judge her inefficiency of spending with, the fact is that objective good was done and without her thousands and thousands would have gone hungry, had 0 access to medicine, and more orphans would not have shelter in poverty stricken areas like India in the 50s. 

But if we want to make the argument that she was a POS because of monetary inefficiency, what then is the bar for ""shit person"" and what percentage of the money has to go directly to aid for them to be considered ""good person""? 

I think what's more important than worrying about where every penny is going to, is recknognizing that despite that inefficiency no one else was trying to help the poor like Theresa in the region. Again, it's nice to sit here nearly 100 years later and call her a shit person, but the reality is still that thousands and thousands would have been much worse off and would have had worse lives if not for her actions. I'd rather good be done and us be able to sit here this far after the fact criticizing how that money was spent than for us to sit here talking about the fact that nobody did anything and the poor continued to get 0 help, just thousands more orphans who died without food in their stomachs, thousands of sick who got no help at all, but hey, at least we know where our precious money is.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoLTZiMm5Vbi1Od09POXh1cGVpenRmZHRkLVU5bGloVGJSdUxTaGt1R3BPZW4xSVh6TVpKZTRISThIeHpoMll2NUF4ZC11elFBbGcxVGhYcEpJbWlRU2c9PQ==

">Ignoring the fact that we don't really have numbers and figures to judge her inefficiency of spending

I'd say the total lack of transparency is a very, very relevant fact. It is considered unacceptable for any legitimate charity.

For example, from interviews with former sisters we know that in just one year from JUST their New York house they garnered more than $50 million in donations. That's ONE admittedly affluent location (which in effect was most of their US presence) and one year.

Not a single cent is accounted for. Because the organization flatly refuses to share its books under any circumstances. There is literally zero reason for that refusal if they are operating anywhere close to legitimately.

The only thing close to financial reporting I can find is from the Indian FCRA which requires reports from NGOs on foreign income being deposited in Indian banks. But that can only show us that sums are reaching India, not how much was originally collected and further, it is just a snapshot of account balances and does not inquire into what is done with the money.

What percentage? Hell, 10% would at least be out there accomplishing something. But you can provide no evidence that even that much is being done. Because they are not operating honestly. No evidence either way exists because they are keeping secrets where it is generally understood there should be transparency",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoN2QyaFZTczltb1FyX2ZwNkthbGpzZEJmQnN5bWx5SDQxdkkxTHNGSzdvdTVCOEkzYlQ2d3ZTU2x5MW5Wa0ZTSkFtMVFlLVA3RDkwMnNERks1VmxjbWc9PQ==

"Unacceptable for legimitimate charities *today*. In the early / mid 20th century there was no standard like this in place or demand for transparency, all that really mattered to anyone was that someone was helping and using their resources for that, for which I'm sure again thousands who were helped are very thankful. Assuming that just because they didn't report income in a time where this wasn't a standard means they were grossly misusing that money is the same as assuming that they spent 100% of it on good causes - we simply do not know but what we do know is that thousands we're fed, bed and provided medical care. 

And while modern day they should be transparent, again, people aren't calling her a POS because she didn't report where every penny she received went.

She ran a hospice (for those who are dying), not a hospital. The idea of intentionally not giving pain medications is also false; they were under supplied.

"Personally, I haven‚Äôt looked into the claims one way or another, but I agree much of that take is just overly excited pop atheists repeating stuff that sounds good so they can keep stuffing religious people into a box that‚Äôs easy to dismiss.

But it seems to be an increasingly popular sentiment, and it‚Äôs just what my mind went to when I saw the statue. Also clarified that I was just guessing.

Gladly, that was not directly the artist‚Äôs intent, from what another commenter said.

There‚Äôs a lot of gray area in the world, and I can believe her work may have fallen into that gray area (I wasn‚Äôt there, I never met her), but I also agree the complete demonization of her story and her work seems‚Ä¶ a little zealous, at least.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoVWFoaE40cWhXM0U1MWY2SUtZbnQyay1NRDB2ejd2ZFJWdUtfUDV0QlI5Y3RLUmw0cFNHRlh5Wkx0MzFxNXZ2ZmVoamhIbFRwRzc3VUY4MUJJaXZnNlE9PQ==

"I think she was actually an early, visible case of ""celebrity derangement syndrome"". She became a caricature of what she should have stood for, trotting the globe with a hand out and saying shit that only made sense to her. So many of her quotes are so easily criticized because she just said a lot of shit. She was operating from a lexicon of concepts (the Catholic faith) that never made any sense to begin and she kept regurgitating it over and over again for decades until it became word soup.

Because her actions were based in irrational nonsense, as her fame grew all those paradoxes of her faith grew more and more stark, visibly incompatible with reality.

Here‚Äôs a paradox of her faith. The world operates by God‚Äôs will. The world is full of pain and suffering. Pain and suffering is god‚Äôs will. God is the source of all that is holy. Pain and suffering are holy.

It‚Äôs not just because of something she once said that can be twisted‚Ä¶ it is a line of reasoning built into her faith. A line of reasoning that most are savvy enough to avoid following but that celebrity derangement kind of removed the rails from her thinking and words. I don‚Äôt think she worshipped pain consciously on a daily basis. But I also think that if you asked her ‚ÄúIs pain the will of god and holy‚Äù she would answer yes. Because that‚Äôs what her faith in fact says. The Pope himself would stumble over the question and equivocate.

I want to point out that her charities still exist today and still collect millions in donations‚Ä¶ and still have zero transparency.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoc2xKM2Fab2pzSE4yTXNZZU1YMnprVTc5UGw2N3F0eWo0bzhEcTA2QTg1b3M1SllEWW1fM20waWlHdGcwMEJkZGdtYjJfVThDUkdLWUdUX0F0UWZPZ2c9PQ==
"This was the second of three pieces displayed for my balloon art exhibition, MESSENGERS. The show highlighted three mysterious bringers of truth and wisdom whose motives are meant to be viewed through a critical lens.

Half the work of coming up with ideas is staying receptive to inspiration. The inspiration for The Scribe came from an image here on reddit of a lava cave in Hawaii that had the look of a pit opening straight to hell with the souls of the damned being dragged under. Looks rad, has religious connotations, and most importantly, a chance to do something interesting with the lighting. I wanted each piece to feel like its own fully formed artwork, so unique lighting was a must. 

I turned to demonology for more inspiration, incorporating my practice of Satanism as a reinforcement of the themes of caution against jumping to conclusions based on aesthetics. Modern-day Satanism is not about Satan as a real existent entity. It‚Äôs about valuing humanistic ethics and highlighting the hypocrisy of christian nationalists. I pulled inspiration from Gamigin, who sometimes takes the form of an anthropomorphic horse with multiple sets of arms, along with the pale spindliness of Gollum, given this would be a cave-dwelling creature.  
  
I imagined the creature as a Moses character, retreating to an out of reach locale to bring back a message transcribed from an unknowable source. Thus was born The Scribe. The transference of ancient wisdom through individuals across history is an inevitably corrupting and distorting force. A fact that messengers of such wisdom work hard to belie.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoQ1I3N0VIcXVCSjBWTWJtc3J5bTQyYXlOZk9JUjlwN2JzdHMyLXVMN1dpc0JFTC1IeU5kclNYUk1nTENMaDdLTXg3Uk9CLVBSUzRhRjJhYUlWR1JJcHc9PQ==

"I'm Back! Here is my next piece in my series inspired by Grant Wood's American Gothic. I didn't explain this well last time but this is meant to be an exaggerated view across the aisle, its not a representation of reality but more of what one side thinks of the other. I even used a lot of the comments from the right (and my Dad) on my last post to come up with some of my design decisions.  I'm not sure if this is going to go over as well, but I didn't pull punches representing poor conservatives as racists so I felt I should go just as hard with this one. This is the last extremely offensive one I'm going to do, I have much subtler ones I am working on for the future.

"I was scouting during the day and happened to stumble upon this moment while walking through a small canyon.

The shadowy woman lasted about..2 minutes then disappeared. I've tried to go back and photograph her again, but haven't been able to see her shadow since this moment. It's truly a moment of luck, and I loved photographing her.

I had to use my telephoto lens to frame her quickly, if I remember correctly this was with my 70-200MM. I took several different compositions, but this one was my favorite of them all.

"**Nadine and Orelyn‚Äôs Beach Day! Plus Ten Felim (Angel-Cats!)**

Nadine is taking Orelyn to the beach for the first time! Orelyn might have read about golden sands and the endless blue of the ocean in musty tomes but seeing the sea in person is a completely different experience! Orelyn is wearing her **Goggles of Day**, an item I‚Äôve made and ten **felim** (angel-cats) have also joined the fun! Can you find them all?

Characters: **Nadine Fournier, Half-Elf, Half-Angel Divine Sorceress and Baker; and Orelyn, Dark Elf Abjuration Wizard and Archaeologist**

**Nadine** is a half-elf divine sorceress whose command of the Eternal Light comes from her forbidden lineage as the illegitimate daughter of an angel and an elf paladin who broke his oath of chastity.

To save her from divine wrath, Nadine‚Äôs celestial mother hid her in the rural village of Erzy deep into the mainland of the kingdom of Montbonnet, where she grew up bullied as ‚Äúears‚Äù and the ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù for her unusual appearance and particularly her pointed ears. She knew she could just wish the wounds inflicted upon her by the local bullies to close but chose to keep her magic hidden in fear of being accused of witchcraft.

Wandering into the ancient forest of Vertombre after her work in the bakery was done for the day, she became friends with the last remaining wood elf of the forest, Grannie Lorywen, and her half-elven great-grandson, Felynur Greenshade.

As Nadine grew up, her former bullies became her admirers and would-be suitors, but she just smiled and ignored their advances before venturing into the ancient forest each evening. For Nadine, life became good for a while.

Then disaster struck the kingdom.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzQ3d6SEVoa2RLakpxcjRndGs1dEFTRUY0RU0zall4bFZzc1NxWjlCdDlJY0NXaEdEV1lmSkgwMGFxclFLMEE5bVpFeEJyLURWdnNjdHNSU04td1Z1OFE9PQ==

"I don't see a lot of views expressed by the liberal extremists as inherently liberal. They want to jail people for not using their correct pronouns, disarm everyone and are equally quick to try to cancel people they don't like as the right is, sometimes its justified but sometimes its over drinking starbucks. I think intentionally misgendering people is stupid and petty, but jailing someone for speech you don't like is not liberal, and completely disarming the populous is also not necessarily a liberal idea, these are things dictators do. I've seen obvious liberals being called conservative over their view on gun issues. The things that now qualify someone as liberal has been reduced to a few key issues that either effect a very small percentage of the population or alienate a large group of both parties. That and the lack of action on the part of the democratic party on the things that would help the country as a whole push people away from the party, and make them indifferent to the outcome of elections.

"see, it only takes one viewpoint for someone to be barred from being a liberal. Again, I'm not saying thats a mainstream liberal view, its an extreme liberal view expressed by an extreme minority but blown up to distract people from real issues and and push people further right. And with the lack of personal research people do, it propagates. I'm also not a centrist, but I don't give a singular fuck about social issues when it comes to things you choose to express vs things you can't not express, such as race.  Everyone needs to suppress some aspect of their identity in order not offend or make other people uncomfortable, and I believe forcing your religion, sexuality, political views or anything else into the public is tacky and disrespectful.

"On this sub itself!  
Just look at the message I received for reporting this account on r/Art

Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by people like you. In order to keep communities welcoming, safe, and great places to be, everyone who uses the platform operates by a shared set of rules.

Banned 3-days for report abuse

Someone on the platform reported the following:

Content shared from AdventureJuntos on 06/17/2024 UTC

After reviewing, we found that you broke Rule 8 by abusing our reporting tool. Using Reddit‚Äôs reporting tools to spam, harass, bully, intimidate, abuse, or create a hostile environment is not allowed. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, and a big part of what makes the platform a safe space for people to express themselves and be a part of the conversation is that redditors look out for each other by reporting content and behavior that breaks the rules. Moderators and administrators rely on redditors to accurately report rule-breaking activity, so when someone uses Reddit‚Äôs reporting tools to spam or harass mods and admins, it interferes with the normal functioning of the site.

As a result, we‚Äôre issuing a temporary 3-day ban on your account and asking you not to break this rule again.

"you do see the irony in calling me close minded while taking offense to someone not adhering specifically to your views, right?  I personally am perfectly fine calling people whatever they want to be called. But I find forcing other people to do the same as a waste of effort and resources and in many cases counterproductive, as hateful people tend to double down on hate instead of admitting they are wrong. I find it most productive to just ignore them, they don't matter, hopefully those kinds of people die soon and their ideas with them. I believe the energy would be better spent making sure these ideas cant be fostered into the future by banning home and private schooling or at least making their diplomas worthless, and making education funding equal for everyone instead of just based off the areas the schools are in.

I definitely did NOT maintain focus ü§£. I started this piece back in November of 2022.

The driving message is my personal perspective of the result of policy in the UK during the Covid lockdown tackling issues of a lack of support for key workers, social inequality, and misdirected attention. If you weren't aware, the then prime minister (Boris Johnson) was caught in a scandal in which he and his fellow party members hosted a party during the publicly mandated lockdowns they set the rules for. Basically, blatant hypocrisy, proving they believed the rules did not apply to them.

I wouldn't say I think their reasonable, but that doesn't make them any less valid. Religion is in no way based on reason, but you should be able to believe in it if you want. Being able to hold your own beliefs is kinda the backbone of freedom. Your view seems to be no ones views are valid but your own, which is exactly what the right believe about their own views.

"Watching the documentary Crumb (1994) about Maxon's brother Robert for the first time the other day I was utterly glued to the screen for most of the running. A lot of the artwork in the film is fascincating but I was particularly struck by Max's artwork - to me it portrays a great deal of suffering and a profound abdunance of creativity, a link with deep subconscious thought processes. When you see Max on film it is difficult not to feel uncomfortable - a tortured artist with dark past.

I wonder if any of you have recommendations for similar artwork - and whether this type of art has a name or genre. Many thanks.",r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN1aGk4SHpocHUwT2xUcEhldjh4WTI0SFlwVWdfYVpiSjRvTzRqR2hDQkhKR3VqcllEOHNwZERxZzN4WlYwRkI2LWN6RFVMNEpNZlFZejFRYklQcThSNWc9PQ==

Idk maybe tryna dictate what art other people make isn't a good thing to do. Its perfectly valid to not like this piece but don't be a total fucking dickhead to the artist for making something that you don't personally like.,r/art,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2NU1QVG5adEp4S2NkWVlramUycFBoTDNaY3FhWUFUR3JhQlpJaEU2VlhlQWZ0Q0FiUGhpbVIzMFlEeEFCVDV5b3ZyaTV4c3VCb0JHMlZPRkZYckZ4RVdWNzJxVm8zYVQ1dGg2WUZiVGdRZXM9

Which is only a problem if your only interaction with this sub is through your own front page or r/all.

This piece is stunning! The oil pastels really bring out the rich textures of the lipstick and fur. The details are incredible and make the artwork feel so alive.
