"Appreciate the response.  And I get that India is doing what’s best for them and that they are not rich per capita.  But India is ranked #5 in the world based on GDP.  So with that said, when we are talking about empowering/enabling….  I’d think being such a big friendly trading partner with Russia definitely means something when you’re ranked #5 in the world.

For instance I found the article below:

>India’s bilateral trade with Russia stood at $65.6 billion in FY24, up 33 per cent year-on-year, and nearly 5.5 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion. The bilateral trade has increased especially since 2022 with Indian fuel importers snapping up discounted Russian crude despite repeated criticism by Western nations.

>if this is the goal of the US to try and shape India into a world leader that promotes stability

Russia is slowly being forced to choose between India and China (for a number of reasons) the US is trying to increase the chances that if/when that happens India turns west (and towards maintaining the status quo) vs going down a more disruptive authoritarian path.

Basically the US wants India to see them (and the EU) favorably and be inclined to support normal relations (drone strike okay, invasion and seizing land bad).

A lot of Democrats are not clinging to Biden.  The most important bit is that Biden has over 90% of the pledged delegates set for the Convention in the primary we just had.  So Democrats that feel he should step aside need to convince him to step aside so that he will release his delegates to someone else.  That someone else would almost certainly be Vice President Harris for a number of reasons but most relevantly as she's the only other potential replacement who has legal access to the millions of dollars raised by the Biden campaign for the election.,r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVV8wOWNiS2JCbUNjdzVHc0NOdzI0MlpFSS0zNEU5TDdybFZEV3pNUlk0WkZZNXZkOERlRFBmWTVQTVhiZnJEbHRmLTdYY1gwRDBvbkkzbkNUbU9nSEE9PQ==
"I believe it’s a multi layered answer.

1) Biden still has a right to run. If he doesn’t step aside of his own free will, they cannot force him. He was winning his primaries, albeit against nobodies, handily. Nobody serious stepped up to run against him. So why would he step down? Forcing him out somehow could be a very bad look for the DNC and majorly backfire on them. 

2) A year + ago it probably wouldn’t have been so bad. The main issue currently is the timing. We are 4 months away from Election Day. That’s not a lot of time to mount a nationwide campaign for president. Yes, a large contingent will vote strictly against Trump. But there are a ton of moderate/centrist/independent voters who do sit on the fence and 4 months may not be enough time to win them over. 

3) Most polls, that I have seen, show that no other potential candidates poll better than Biden does anyway. Though Whitmer and Buttigieg do seem to perform better in key swing states to make those races more interesting.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUGFQbGk5clB2YnplZnV0SWZFMHEwenR2djd6aU41SGdWN1puaG91QnBZZ2VITkRWMXBuV2dKUWxreEdKU0otRV81cnI5WlhtVW05QXVJRzd3MXN4NXc9PQ==
"I don't agree with all of these but here are the common arguments against  
  
1. Its anti democratic: Biden did win all of the democratic primaries (atleast partly because no other significant democrats ran against him) 

2. It is uncertain: This would be an unprecedented change no party has changed its candidate this late in the election cycle and there isn't a clear process for it. 

3. Who is the replacement: Switching now there isn't a slam dunk replacement Harris would be the most likely but people didn't vote for her as the candidate. A lot of infighting could occur between the different segments of the democratic party

4. Money: The Biden campaign already has a massive war chest of funds that only it can access and due to campaign finance laws it could not transfer the vast majority of it to a new campaign. (possibly could to Harris as she is part of the current campaign) 

5. Personal: At this point there is no mechanism to replace Biden unless he chooses to be replaced.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZm1fTDNkcnBjMVY3LU9WdlhxWVdhdFE2ZGFDM0xVRzNjdHhnSllGYjFaQnlsOGdac2RZLXBmbUpVRzFjNWI3dlE2WXA1WVR2YmJQeHUwQkh2eHRiM2c9PQ==

"Biden cannot be forced not to run. He's secured the delegates to win the nomination and they are required to vote for him on the first ballot at the convention unless he releases them. The DNC changing the rules at this point to allow them to no longer be pledged to Biden would invite lawsuits immediately. 

If Biden were convinced to not run the question becomes who is the nominee? There would be a substantial party fight at the convention to decide the nominee. 

No potential nominee polls substantially better than Biden. And as soon as a nominee was chosen the Republican party would initiate an all out attack on that individual as well as on the Democratic party as a whole for being disorganized, corrupt, etc...

The nominee would have about 3 months to gain enough name recognition and trust to win the election. Candidates usually take years to establish that type of recognition. Trying to do it in 3 months is virtually impossible.

"Polls nowadays don't rely on cell methods alone. The best polls are a blend of methods for reaching voters, including online means. 

Even so, yes response rates are very low. But as long as you get enough respondents in each demographic bucket you can weigh the results to produce a representative sample of the electorate. 

Furthermore, banking the future of American democracy (not to mention abortion, LGBT rights, contraception, IVF, etc) on the largest polling miss since at least 1998 is a foolish strategy. 

>Remember the ""Red Wave"" all the polls predicted in 2022?

"A few reasons:

—As much as it sounds like anyone would do better against Trump compared to Biden, Trump actually does better against everyone else. The only person who gives him trouble in the polls is Biden. Trump beats people like Harris, Whitmer, Newsom, Pete, etc. in polls. Biden and Trump are about even. Trump beats basically everyone else in the polls. The only logical candidate besides Biden, Harris, actually does worse in the polls. 

—Think about how embarrassing it would be if Dems said “yup, we’re switching out Biden.” That’s after supporting him for a year and a half. That’s basically admitting you messed up. That’s a guaranteed loss for the Dems. 

—Depending on the timing of the replacement: If it’s after September, it’s after early voting has already started in some states. What do you do with all those printed ballots that say Biden on them? What are you going to do when someone sues their state when they want to vote for Biden but he’s no longer on the ticket but he’s still on their ballot?

—Millions of Americans have already voted for Biden in the primaries. Do we just tell them their vote doesn’t matter anymore? The public already has a bad perception of the DNC after basically blackballing all candidates in 2016 in favor of Hillary. This would look like more meddling

—Who is going to get the money from fundraising? You can’t just magically transfer funds from one person to another. It’s not a bank account

—And, most importantly, you have to ask Biden before you replace him. What would happen if Democrats replaced him and he found out through the papers or didn’t have a say? Why not ask him first, “do you want to drop out” and then if he says no then say “we really want you to drop out?” You can’t just replace someone just because you want to",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWHI3ZEN6WER6ckZWQlpFQTlYcDVGaUFWTURhMkFRQ1hjbFk5NlF3NEFHbjdXWTU4RnZ3cjdjMFk5NG9uMTU5aWYycXZGZWJRVVJycngzWjJna2p0ZHc9PQ==

1.  This is a test

2.  It even indents for you.

That said,

>Convince Harris to step down from the ticket (and accept the insult)

Even more, there is an entire section of the Democratic party that would also have to accept the insult.  Harris, a BIPOC female has to step aside for a white male (Newsom) or white female (Whitmer)?  That's madness.  Michelle Obama might make it tolerable, but man, that would be a challenge.

>Move millions of dollars in campaign contributions between multiple parties

I saw it mentioned before (and I did once myself) but there is some question whether Biden's warchest could be [used by the new nominee](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/09/us/politics/biden-harris-money.html), even [if that's Harris](https://thehill.com/video/what-happens-to-biden%e2%80%99s-campaign-cash-if-he-drops-out/9858847/).  Someone else entirely?  Probably not.  So that's another thing Harris has on them.

But also another aspect is that a *bunch* of Americans voted for Biden in the primaries.  You're subverting that, for one, but also then have to deal with allegations that this has been an open secret before the primaries started.  You've basically taken the choice out of their hands and into the hands of the ""elites"" (for lack of a better term)... that's gonna make this convention a lot like '68 and I bet there's fury.

Sadly, there's no good solution to this.  And, even if I'm going to flush my vote for the libertarian again, its not good for the country.  I don't want Trump to basically win by default, but I've also seen loved ones going through this stuff... and I feel bad for everyone personally.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSlZjYTBQZV9Sa1B4SkRvdFhlRWJpa09mRXE3Vzg5MzhJbFRaeGFzWjEzbWFLT0V0LTVnYU9FbmlaWTQ0bmRNNk16NmFjNjV1RTRHZWtILVFad3FrZWc9PQ==

As for everything else:

I would remind everyone that we aren't selecting a single person, but an entire branch of the government. God forbid the worst case scenario regarding Biden's health is true and he is a year or two from being forced to step down. In that case the only thing that matters is ""Is Joe Biden the sort of person to pick people loyal to America or himself for cabinet positions?"" if the answer is the former then there are mechanics in place to ensure everything continues properly.

"Others have had a different take, and they are not completely wrong.  

My take: 

Biden has a bit of a stutter and he will often make impulsive comments to the press that hurt him later.  This has always been true.  Trump is a bad candidate for a lot of reasons.  

The people surrounding/supporting Biden have tried to limit Biden's exposure to unscripted press to let Donald keep saying things that damage his campaign.  

Their thoughts: ""We will win if we can keep the focus on Trump""

Since the debate, for the first time in 10 years, the media isn't focusing on Trump.  Talking about replacing Biden is keeping the focus off Trump.  Actually replacing Biden will keep the focus off Trump even longer.  This goes against the entire campaign strategy of the Biden supporters so they see it as a losing strategy.  

This is why, not only do they not want to replace Biden, they want everyone and the press to stop talking about it.

Edit: I and many others think, not only it wouldn't be a big deal, it would be a great thing for the Democratic party by proving that the Democrats care more about running a good candidate than being a cult supporting one man like a fascist government",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUm9QVElHWDhlZjhxY2swSGh1VG5USDFIdXpFTnVSbDZEMi13YzFVd3B1cFRHZFp4cnRZSE1maWpNZTdWdVRpTFlpS1oybjBNSTVPRUw5TzNmdlB4OXc9PQ==

Jason Palmer beat Joe Biden in American Samoa so got 3 delegates making him the only person since Kennedy in 1980 to beat an incumbent in any territory.  He ascribes this to having 4 virtual town halls.

"I think the loudest voices against Biden aren't coming from the Democrats. The first time he should have run, the DNC put all of their support behind Hillary. We see how well **THAT** turned out. 

The worst-case scenario is he runs, gets reelected, takes the oath, and resigns shortly after. Then Harris will assume the office. While she would have the financial backing, the fact that she'd have trouble is because she is a female person of color. She has spent the last year drumming support for Biden,  who fits ""the look"" of a president: an old white guy. 

If Biden resigns after taking office, Harris will have 4 years to drum up support for herself. And she'll need it. Look at how Obama got the support of minorities when he ran in '08. He needed it in 2012, running against Romney, who was suddenly embraced by the Evangelical Christians. IIRC,  Billy Graham removed the pages from his website, which denounced the Mormon church. She'll face the same bigotry that Obama did.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeHQtbFFZZEJqUENkZDBBUC1nSXJuSkx0ZUpQckZCMV9yeDZ4cDlMbFE1WVpWd2dWRkJ5SWFMRmtvekdoWmhCQjBqN3hKbWwzYnZKakhyY3lpUjNnM3c9PQ==
"I don't necessarily agree with all of these, but these are the arguments:

* Biden won the primary contests, which is the way we choose our nominees. That means it'd be very hard to oust him without his cooperation, and he doesn't want to drop. (There are probably ways it could be engineered, but all of them would be controversial among voters, and you'd probably lose more than you'd pick up.)

* The main reason we use primaries to determine who the nominees are is because it provides a testing ground to see how their popularity will hold up through a campaign, see what attacks they'll face, see how voters respond to attacks, etc. If you replace him with somebody who hasn't been through that process, it's entirely possible that they might be popular with voters *now*, but that once they replace Biden, they would lose popularity in response to effective attack ads or scandals that pop up. Biden's weaknesses are at least baked in/predictable--he's not going to lose a whole lot more voters than he already has.

* Everybody else who realistically could replace him polls similarly or worse to him.

* The only person who could *truly* realistically replace him is Vice President Harris, because our campaign finance laws make it complicated to transfer the campaign funds to anyone else. She has her own complications with electability already. (For example, the US has never elected a woman president.)

* This is getting into the nitty gritty of things, but to try to explain it to a non-American ... because of the way America selects its president, there are certain states that matter more than others. The three that are must-win for the Democrats are three Midwestern states where a moderate white male candidate would likely do better than a black woman that's perceived to be very liberal. In 2016, these states swung hard for Trump/against Clinton.

* Biden's not really in an unrecoverable position--he's down about 2-3% in the polls. That's not really a position where you normally consider replacing your candidate. If he was down 10% or something, that idea would make more sense.

* Changing a candidate late in the game like this conveys weakness/panic, and voters don't like that.

* The only two times a party has changed their ticket like that, they lost in landslides anyway. (The Democrats changed their president in 1968 and their VP in 1972.)

* Switching over candidates doesn't mean campaign offices, funds, workers, advertising, etc. automatically transfer. In some ways you'd have to be creating a campaign from scratch a few months out from the election. (You usually have a solid 1.5-2 years to build a campaign.)",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTUpRSDlWTWZiVElLd1FiZXdlTUVLeXJ2RGx6N0Q2U28zUHJXY0V0MUtVeVQ1QXBtWUExcWtYODU0eGg1ZXctcnJUS085Ry1xSG5PQXl3MHROM21kTGc9PQ==
"""No chance"" is inaccurate, but she doesn't poll substantially better than Biden. Polls have Biden an average of [2.9 points down](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden) against Trump, and Harris down an average of [2.1 points](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris). So ... slightly better than Biden, but still not winning. And that's *before* she's faced any serious attacks.

[Her approval ratings](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/) are only slightly higher than Biden's. She's also perceived to be more liberal than Biden, which would make it harder for her to appeal to the middle. And obviously it goes without saying that the US has still never elected a woman president, so that's likely to be a hang-up for at least some voters, too. All that said, she's definitely younger, sharper and more vibrant than Biden, and would be able to run a much more energetic campaign. If that's the main thing voters are worried about, she'd absolutely provide a contrast.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSXpQLTVlanB1NXdiNkNQdGJWVWl2VFhBTF9QN0xuWVVtZDNJWnBSTHR0ZUZXMEU4MThyeUZxeDdzOERQTkFNdWJSUTYwSm5iaTVMN3NCdkd5ZHZDNFE9PQ==

"Are you asking *is this a good idea* or *is this politically possible*?

Either way, the answer is no. If Biden were to step down (even self-demotes to VP), then that's an acknowledgement that he's incapable of leading. If he's incapable of leading, he shouldn't be on the ticket.

And someone doesn't need to be VP in order to advise the president.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblZQNkVpUHhfMGUzOVp2N0RUYnpvRmdnZ2ZfS1NpTEMxWEhFU3RDeUNlZDFOX1RkQk5lMkNYdTRxQTFwQ0lfMlpRd2ZJVHpYbk5vQ3VxaXR3Wll6dFE9PQ==

"I'm not exactly certain they do. There's probably some degree of legacy with the standards set by the world rapidly getting rid of their monarchies virtually simultaneously, but what constitutes ""rightwing"" and ""leftwing"" is a lot more enigmatic than people realize.  Like, the traditional definitions of conservative vs. liberal primarily pertain to *only* the economy, and entirely leave out the sociological and political affects various different country's version of ""conservative/liberal"" take. 

Like, the US Republican party is actually pretty big on big government--- in all aspects but economic. In that they are very happy to deregulate large corporations--- but heavily regulate their citizens at the request of those corporations. 

Where as in my country, the Conservative party tends to be more traditionally conservative--- as in, they will sit on their hands and let everyone figure it out for themselves until they don't have a choice but to do something.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTGJWc24zcDVhbmxBZ01udlo2ekh3clpJdFdrTWswQlBnTlNET0w0c1YwZzdFMGZfSW9nS294bUY1SF90ejUxSzRBR3UzVWF4OXQzNUlXSlFqNFhWMjQwRmcyRElSa0phU3JwN1JZQy1hTk09

"They probably could but it is very late in the game and Biden would have to agree. There are limited avenues to do it and limited avenues to force it to happen. And no matter how you feel about him there were plenty of people that picked him in the primary. So should we ignore the wishes of those that voted for him?

The Democrats should have had an open primary and let the people decide. Obviously there is debate if the people choose the best candidate but at least with multiple people running they have the choice. For whatever reason Democrats wanted to put all their chips on the table for Biden and many of them knew he was in mental decline.  The Republicans might be a mess too but they weren't afraid to let the people decide.

It also seems counter productive to claim you want to save democracy and yet you want to remove your own candidate from the ballot.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac3Y5SkVuNV9SSnI2RGpJU1VQTnRXODUzQTVrcUNCUGRlVWJwSjZPNUY3Y284S2J6VGxmb2Q3VFVOSjZ1VlFBaFQxX3FvWklnUndVUzctbUxxakdzRlE9PQ==

"Only a state can call for an election, even if every state was willing (and GOP controlled ones aren't) the process of setting that up would take longer than a month. 

The US has over 116,000 polling stations that would need to be set up (and pulled from their usual task), staffed, and then counted.

That also ignores the logistical problem of setting up remote voting for everyone who needs it and the fact that some states can still reject the results (at least one state demanded that the DNC vote already or face not being on the ballot).

">The issue is that I’ve had great difficulty in finding unbiased sources to learn from

The problem here is that you're never going to find an unbiased source. It's impossible. They do not exist. The key is to read something, identify in what ways the author(s) might be biased, and then combine those two things with other readings on a subject.

"There's no such thing as an unbiased source. If there was most people would just read that. Just read as much as you can. Try to understand the author's biases and your own. Use that to be understanding to be critical of what people say and how you react to it. That's probably the best thing you can do.

That said Wiki is usually pretty decent, since there's often a bunch of different authors for an article. Here's the article for social democracy for example.

"The article you linked is very much not in the mainstream, and the wordplay it relies on (""the 22nd Amendment doesn't say the candidate is *ineligible,* just that they shall not be *elected*) is a little non-sensical. Saying that a candidate ""Shall not be elected"" is synonymous with saying they're ineligible. 

Beyond the plain reading of the text, if that argument is accepted it makes the 22nd Amendment meaningless. The scheme that you're laying out is exactly what the 22nd Amendment was passed to prevent. Beyond the legal issues (and maybe even election certification issues) that would cause, voters would likely not buy it.

"Look at how Trump behaves, and compare it to Biden.

Here's Trump's July 4th message this year:

> Happy Fourth of July to all, including to our highly incapable “President,” who uses Prosecutors to go after his Political Opponent, who choked like a dog during the Debate but tried to pretend it was “International Travel” (only 12 days rest!) and, when that gig was up, he blamed it on a “cold.” Therefore, why would anyone say he’s cognitively challenged? Also, respects to our potentially new Democrat Challenger, Laffin’ Kamala Harris. She did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting to Iowa, but that doesn’t mean she’s not a “highly talented” politician! Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco. Someone else that I have to compliment is a Deranged Biden Prosecutor named Jack Smith, who has become a Legend in his own mind for all of those cases he has lost. The Corrupt Prosecutors are working hard for Crooked Joe, but it will never be enough — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Here's Biden's:

> As we celebrate the Fourth of July, I’m grateful for the countless service members who are the backbone of who we are as a nation. Their service reminds us that democracy is never guaranteed—every generation must fight to maintain it.

I mean, it's not even close. It's a joke that we're even talking about this.",r/ask_politics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnNFRRYS1ETDdjUUpjOTlUeFlHTkV5U1FCeHozVnUwMEFsR1RHQzU0Uk5kTTMxR1pPdk9qYWZ3RVZNUFRrY18xbkxRNzNtM3JWSEx2RXpjZVNwSUxqaEE9PQ==
