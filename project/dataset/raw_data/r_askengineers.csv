">but it becomes dependent on exact geometry/materials/conditions/kfactor/preload

No, the main principle here, that the threads will work well ""coaxially"", does not really depend on any of those factors. Think about it: the design means (or is intended for) an even load application at the flats, which means an equal compression strain, call it x, on each thread bearing ""cylinder"". Whether we have two coaxial threads or multiple.

So just from Hookes law (and a somewhat simplified geometrical modeling):

Force per ""cylinder"" F = x\\*modulus\\*Area = x\\*modulus\\*pi\\*diameter\\*cylinderwallthickness

Thread Shear Area = threaded height\\*pi\\*diameter

In calculating tread shear stress, the factor pi\\*diameter cancels out:

Thread shear stress = F/TSA = (x\\*modulus\\*cylinderwallthickness) / threaded height

So shear stress on any one of these coaxial threads is independent of thread diameter, i.e. if it's an inner or outer co-axial thread.

I can imagine a use case with a type adjustible shim, a very slim pad with both huge load capacity and adjustibility. For multiple coaxial threads the great total thread length means the threaded length per ""cylinder"" can be made very short and with a small thread profile, and the whole thing made very flat.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNURNUjhqMHVJbDVuM21mWmhWQlBXYWZ5ejZaQ2NnUDRPV2dWeUFNU2gyY29HZ21FSC1NVkthTnc0bFo3MElWdVpoc0Zqcmtoc1N1LURFeDhqR1FvekE9PQ==

"This isn't done because of logistics and cost. 


While 5000 seems like a lot of cameras, realistically they aren't going to be enough to cover the area you think they will.  5000 cameras might be enough to cover a single county in the US, but not a big one. 


And they still can miss the aircraft.


Cameras have the same problem as RADAR. They have a maximum sensor size,  and a focal length,  which determines how large an object can appear to them, but that is opposed by how large the field of view gets to be. 


If you've got your camera set to view a wide section of sky, that aircraft 7 miles up m might only register a single pixel at a time on the sensor,  and that's not even very remotely enough because you can't just identify that something is there,  you must identify what it is,  or you'll be sending missiles after bugs.


If you do the reverse and have the camera  zoomed in to clearly see objects that are far away,  now the camera is only seeing a hundredth to a thousandth of its area of coverage,  and you can't even see the F16's following a half mile behind the stealth fighter that serve to eliminate ground launch sites.


Now, you can bump up the resolution of those sensors a lot to compensate for the deficiencies of the sensors that come with typical drones,  but now your sensor alone might cost $20k, and it and it's cooling system weighs 50lb instead of 2 ounces. How many $50k drones can your military afford? Remember,  you are going to need hundreds just to protect a single military unit,  because you have to have them far enough out from the unit to detect aircraft BEFORE they launch ordinance, which they can easily do from double-digit mile distances while at high altitude.


Oh, and you've got to employ someone you both spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to train,  and continue to pay about $100k a year to monitor those cameras and be the final verification on a good target. How many cameras can one person monitor effectively? 3? 2? So you need a lot of those as well,  and well paid techs, and a big contract with an aerospace company because off-the-shelf drone/camera systems are likely hundreds of years from being effective at what you ask.


RADAR systems also have an advantage over cameras in being able to detect distance with a single antenna by noting the time it took the pulse to return to the antenna. As the source of data for cameras does not originate at the camera,  you need two cameras synced together but set a significant distance apart so you can use angle deviation to determine distance. The further the distance you want to be able to accurately confirm, the further apart you have to set the cameras, or the more precise their angle sensors must be,  and the more accurate their installation must be. Again,  you can quickly find yourself at major DOD contract levels of cost. ",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbG1mNUhDcGNvVVJQcENoZ1VWeXJsWTk1SzMyb3Y3S09KUm5wWTA1NG9GeEtLaW5GN0ZSSl9zQXRqeHhIb2VZN1BhSjdyZ2M0a3BhV2lKUGRXNEhyOWc9PQ==

"Both ISO and ASME have different tolerance classes for threads.

For UNC/UNF threads you typically see the class called out(eg 1A, 2A, 3A, 1B, 2B, 3B), and then the machinist will find the relevant tolerances in a chart. This provides the tolerances for pitch diameter, and the major/minor diameter.

ISO standards also call out the class for threads (for example 5g6g).  Again the machinist would find the tolerances from a chart or book.

"Indeed. Most of the _energy_ from hydrocarbon fuel comes from its hydrogen. The carbon backbone is a convenient carrier for the hydrogen. Plus, it adds a bit of energy.

"If you scale up all dimensions with constant weight then it will have best L/D and equivalent glide ratio at a lower speed. Remember that drag is also a function of velocity. Drag is the sum of parasite and induced drag and the velocity factors make total drag proportional to v^2 + v^-2 for constant lift. This drag curve has a minimum where L/D and glide ratio is at a maximum. A heavier aircraft at the same weight need to fly faster for best L/D and a lighter aircraft will need to fly slower, however this L/D max is the same value for all weights even though it occurs at different speeds for different weights. The takeaway is that L/D is purely geometric and depends solely on the shape of the airframe, with dimensional scale and weight determining the speed for L/D max. Sailplanes often carry ballast to achieve a higher glide speed but this doesn't affect the glide ratio. The purpose of ballast is to increase speed when lift is strong and higher sink rates are acceptable. It will be dumped in the evening when thermals die out and to reduce landing speed. A sailplane has a peaky L/D curve due to the high aspect ratio wing. L/D decreases rapidly as speed moves away from best L/D. A glider with short stubby wings has a flatter L/D against velocity and is said to have better penetration, meaning that it can fly fast to offset headwinds and sink without so negatively affecting L/D. The L/D curve is called the polar and it is basically fixed for a given airframe. Increases in weight move it to the right and slightly widen it, but they do not increase L/D max. Scaling up the dimensions has the same effect as decreasing weight: the polar will shift to the left and narrow slightly, however the peak L/D will have the same value.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOVN0UU9ydTZlNjhBOGRBbElUSU5WVTVHWkJZMjFfQnBQX2VWdHBTY2dDcUNTaEhmQmhlb1pTMERKUEMyblNaNlQtZ25wZXZlOGZIamk4MDUzOGhfdVE9PQ==

"I had a very similar unit to that one in the UK. The house I lived in used to be several houses but they knocked some walls down and my house was born, probably over a hundred years ago. I had a fireplace with a chimney and I thought about using it like you are thinking about using it, but I ended up finding a wall that I think used to be a chimney in one of the other houses. It had a small rectangular hole in it that I was able to mount my AC exhaust hose to, and it worked well. But the reason was because it had a good seal. If you just put your hose in the chimney, some of the hot air might make it out, but most of it will just flood the room making it hotter than it would be if you just left the unit off.

"The dual hose unit I used to have was really frustrating, because it had vents open to the room in parallel with its intake hose. Of course, that was a much more direct route for air to flow than the hose, so while it did pull _some_ air from outside, it also pulled a significant amount of air from inside the room. That meant that it still ended up making other rooms hotter by drawing outside air in.

I eventually hacked around this by sealing up the vents with duct tape and putting a duct fan inline with the intake hose to assist it. It was a _classy_ setup, let me tell you. But at least it worked.

I don't know how to discover this in advance when shopping for one of these. It took me years to figure out the design flaw, since the only way to tell what they'd done from the outside was to shine a flashlight through the vents.

"For you to be a mechanical engineer you will study 3 main things 

How things interact with each other in static and dynamic states.

Theory of materials , from how material interact with external stress and buckling and pressure and failure etc, grid of a materials, material process, manufacturing,like there's too much with in this one

Fluids theory, here you will learn about all types of fluid stuff which can be overwhelming too 

In my opinion those are the core mechanical thoeries

In mech eng you gonna learn about things that use these thoeries in different ways 

How thermodynamics properties are interacting with those theories

How mechanism is influenced by these thoeries 

How machine are putting these thoeries to work

How physical phenomenon are impacting systems, like vibrations

These are not all but just a glimpse of what mech eng can offer 

Putting aside all the previous we get electricity related things 
We get introduced to control ( this one is studied intensively for mechatronics) 
And systems modelling , which are related topic in mechatronics engineerings and embedd engineering

Then the engineer work come and systematically use these things to work with in designs to solve given problems

Even though mechanical engineering have its differences to mechatronics engineering By focusing more on control and electrical circuits, they're closely related and your confusion is reasonable.

The hard control thoery and electrical system experience in mechatronics can be advantageous when you try mechanical engineering specially not all problem require a very strong understanding of mechanical properties of the world and you can wing it by strong common since, but can be a plus, meanwhile mechanical engineering can be very good at all types of problems where mostly mech eng scatter and specialize to different fields usually requiring differnt basics and knowledge base",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSElWbjA1Y1JPRWJ2OWRKdEh0NEhNc1pYamVjeUpjZDUwdGx6OGowc3loV0pSZk9VUlRfQkZFc25kNVdsTXpxZHNhVXZESHh2YWFjV1VkeVlKYk51RWc9PQ==

"I’m not an aerospace engineer, but I do know that a long low aspect ratio wing (I.e., a bigger wing) in fact produces less drag. That’s why gliders look that way, and why comercial airplanes are adding folding wing tips. 

I also know that drag is proportional to the square of speed, and more wing area allows for lower speeds. 

But I don’t know how a biplane, I.e., two wings, compares to a single longer wing.

So far, the only thing I have learned from this post is that the glide ratio *might* remain constant (although I’m not yet convinced that’s true) even though the stall speed would decrease.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYTJzbVQ4WVhKak1iamI1cGQ4LU9GZ2JxVXBlVlhINks2ekJPZTMwaFJrWjg2aEFDMTJzVVlfdFEwaU9uZVFqRDlWS1pzVDVqLVBEcVYtOUxmWFJVZ2c9PQ==

The vehicle will have an estimated mass of 800kg on tires with a radius of 0.35m.

The motor will run into a 2 stage transmission, giving me 6 gears to work with, and then from the transmission through a 3:1 torque converter.

This should be the amount of torque the vehicle has going to its wheels (not accounting for mechanical losses, which I think should be about 80%??)

1st gear = 7.5:1 ratio, 2272 N•m (1678 ft•lbs)

2nd gear = 5:1 ratio, 1515 N•m (1119 ft•lbs)

3rd gear = 3:1 ratio, 909 N•m (671 ft•lbs)

4th gear = 2:1 ratio 606 N•m (448 ft•lbs)

5th gear = 1.5:1 ratio 455 N•m (336 ft•lbs)

6th gear = 1:1 ratio 303 N•m (224 ft•lbs)

Using tire size, motor rpm at 60hz, and gear reduction ratio, I can calculate the top speed of each gear, with 6th gear hitting 80km/h

Now, assuming it takes 110 N•m to keep the vehicle rolling on a flat surface (800kg • 9.8m/s^2 • 0.04 [rolling coefficent of pneumatic tires on dirt road] • 0.35m) I can also calculate the rate of acceleration through each gear on a flat surface.

Now because the motor in question has a 5:1 constant torque rating when using a VFD, I should be putting out the listed torque at each gear regardless of whether I am running the motor at 400rpm or 1800rpm right?

I'm just not really sure how the HP of the engine comes into play here when it looks like top speed is based on gearing and wheel size, while acceleration is based on torque, mass, and gearing.

Would it make more sense to use a 20HP 1200rpm motor over a 25HP 1800rpm motor?

"At larger scale, when one solar panel is getting covered up by a cloud, there's generally another that's getting uncovered, so the minute- to-minute variation isn't really a big deal. 


There is, however, a real problem that stems from the same principle of solar and (although it's different) wind not having the ability to produce on demand. The result of this problem is called the ""duck curve"". Wikipedia has a decent explanation, but I'd also recommend the Energy Information Administration for good explanations of energy topics that are free of the astounding amount of bullshit that muddies the waters, now that everything about energy is so politicized.


https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56880


In short, if you only have a few solar panels and you want to connect them to the grid, that's fine because you just throttle back your on-demand fossil fuel-based generation when you have solar power available and enjoy the fuel and carbon emissions savings. If you build enough solar, though, eventually you'll run out of power plants that are easy to turn off. California has been having problems with this for the last few years.


It's sort of a medium-scale problem in that it isn't really insurmountable, it just means that if you want 1 MW of solar power, it's more complicated than installing 1MW of solar panels. You're probably going to need quite a bit more than 1MW, and you're also going to need enough batteries and charger/inverters to level the load. All this gets expensive.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUURGVzctRUVLVGhRQU1WbENsTzVDWFJOVU1CdzlWNUw0Qk41OHFqaks3cmFzMTFNeXdCVktmaU5zcnV0aHhPWV9oT0ZWZWt0b0dFWHh6QVpHYkJ4RWNBUVEwdHN3MmpCSzBmeTRfc2lrU3c9

4.  Can we test drive up to that Max speed?

5.  Ask them to explain the Magnuson-Moss act when you are talking about warrantees.  Make sure to call them on their bullshit. 

6.  How much lateral acceleration the car can handle.  Ask to test that.

7.  Tell them you will take care of tax/title/license fees on your own. (Seriously, I saved like 2-300 bucks doing this because of dealership labor fees, and they wanted to register me in the city, rather than the county I live in.). 

8.  Ask to take it to a third party mechanic to make sure it's sound. (This is totally normal for a used car, but frickin' weird to do with a car under warranty.)

"Thinking about re-entering my Engineering career? (Career crisis)

Hi! I’m making my first post here since I think I could really use some advice from people in the engineering industry.

I do enjoy working in a smaller teams, mentorship from leadership, doing creative problem solving, becoming an expert in my work, and ideally work at a regular 9-5 pace without expectations of OT and a grinding mindset.

"Would having a ""magic"" layer capable of halting the bullet while being very thin and light be useful in a combined product? It probably wouldn't be useful on its own, but could it lead to small optimisations when one could design the force distribution trauma plate to be 99% of the product (the 1% being a ""magic"" stopper)?

 Sort of like how winter clothes are divided into ""moisture proof shells"" and internal warmth layers, where the shell is just a thin piece of plastic or membrane stuff, less useful at making you warm but stops moisture while having a smaller footprint? 

Possibly if this was the only issue (I am sure it defo isn't) one could make more niche products like bullet ""umbrellas"" or nets where the person is physically far away from the impact site so deformation isn't a problem, similar to just standing a really long distance away from the shooter (like 10+ KMs) or maybe in vehicle armor?

"The point of doing a floating shelf or desk with pipes coming out from the wall is to leave it floating with three of the edges out in the air, away from any possible means support.  That gives a certain visual effect.  In order to achieve that visual effect, one uses support methods that are kind of lousy from an engineering point of view, but are done with strong enough materials and mounting that it works anyway. 

In your situation, you have three edges of the desk along walls. So you could use more conventional means of support.  

I would make the new brackets along the ends the primary support and make the support along the back the incidental extra anti-sag support. 

It probably flexes too much in the middle if you only support it along those three edges.  So you probably need some reinforcement which could be one or more pipes running underneath. I would expect that running those pipes lengthwise would make things easier.

"To battery energy storage systems, but also to hydroelectric, including pumped storage, and also to flexible loads, scheduled or controlled based on real time grid operation.  

In some cases, controlled curtailment of renewables can also make sense.  It can be cheaper to overbuild the solar and plan to dial it back a bit during peak generation times when there isn't sufficient load rather than buying enough battery energy storage to save all of it for later use.  As part of this strategy, not as the main strategy.

The nature of the control needed is not all that different from what's needed now: fundamentally, it doesn't matter much whether the uncontrolled variation is in the load or the source. But as more sources become uncontrolled, the value put on controllable loads and storage will increase, because the people controlling the grid needs *something* to control.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZblNPcmRrcjM3US1SdzFiU1JCdXBWc0lkMkptbHJTTXE2U0VMZlJfTlVPeG03eVBmaDF1eFFqVHcxeDhURjVHeTdJMkJoRFg1RnE2TTBRSExoN2dOSGc9PQ==

"If we had an internal reaction engine that would take gas as an input and perform a chemical reaction that would produce liquid as the output, at a temperature where the liquid would be liquid, that would mean we would generate negative pressure in the cylinder, and we could pull the piston in during the power stroke. I think it could be a pretty nice two-stroke cycle. Intake, and then immediately initiate the reaction and suck the Piston back in, with no need for a compression stroke first.  As you approach top dead center, you would open an exhaust valve and drain out most of the liquid at the very end of the stroke, and then proceed with the intake stroke. 

Of course, hydrogen won't work for that because the reaction is exothermic and water boils easily enough.  What's a reaction between gas molecules that creates either a liquid with a very high boiling point, or is endothermic such that we aren't generating a high temperature?

"I did a little looking around to try to find endothermic reactions that start with gases. None that I found have liquid products, but it would probably be possible to make a highly inefficient and impractical engine using something like the  suction cycle that I described above, but just using the reduction in temperature from the endothermic reaction to lower pressure, not a phase change. 

>The reaction between nitrogen and oxygen at a very high temperature to form nitric oxide (N2 + O2 = 2NO) is an endothermic reaction.

>It occurs in the gas phase. DeltaH (change in enthalpy) for this reaction is +90.3 kJ/mol.

>Another well-known reaction is the high-temperature decomposition of ammonia into its elements-nitrogen and hydrogen-which is the reverse reaction of the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia.

The first reaction is a side reaction in normal combustion engines that one needs to avoid for emissions reasons.  But the ammonia reaction is kind of interesting. One could imagine a process in which you have two internal reaction engines, one running on the suction cycle with hot ammonia gases the input and hydrogen and nitrogen as the output and then the second one a conventional internal combustion engine running on hydrogen, and using the waste heat from the latter to heat the incoming ammonia. 

I'm pretty confident that highly impractical, but I think it would be pretty amusing to try to build one.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ0F1Qm5lWXdrMFdQSE5MLXZEU2FFOWFxN1I5ZTR0M2Fzek9oeVA1bklMY05WNDJIY1liUlVJUWFORVZXeHhZWWlJbFVVN1BzdmdKeWpCT212bENSWHc9PQ==

"Cars really ought to come with a workshop manual or what you refer to as a tech manual, but they don't because the dealerships make a significant part of their money on service and repairs. The official workshop manual is typically digital these days (used to be a physical book or binder), and is an expensive subscription service that manufacturers only make available to dealers and approved shops. Which is why third party manuals also exist, but they aren't free and are in some cases next to useless due to being out of date or based on a model sold in a different market etc.

For older cars, Haynes manuals come in physical book format and are really good. They show with pictures and text how to disassemble and repair just about anything on a specific model car. 

For modern stuff, Haynes have a digital subscription service that goes quite far into the technical details like what voltage you should find on each pin on various systems, but unfortunately leaves out the practical details of how to safely disassemble enough to actually reach that pinout to measure anything.

"Imo, your possible solution is the way to go. Just use a dynamic displacement pump (or if using a positive displacement, have some kind of pressure relief) and use a solenoid valve to control your volume dispensed.  A benefit here is that there's already a ton of purpose designed components because that's generally how things like the water feed for ice makers and drink dispensers work (but often without a pump b/c they're operating off of line pressure).  You can even get rid of the worrying about if the pump provides smooth flow by including in a reservoir of large enough volume (doesn't even have to be like a tank, could just be larger diameter tubing of sufficient length) that's maintained at a pressure that's high enough to ensure uninterrupted flow for some safety factor above the maximum amount that you're intending on flowing.  Size your orifice to give you a flow rate that puts you within the operational speed of the valve you choose, and accuracy shouldn't be much of a problem.  This also reduces complexity of control because it becomes a timing thing. If you want to add extra fancy, you can check for pressure and fluid presence in the line to have it call for/kill the pump.  This may be necessary considering your requirement of ""no risk of releasing harmful gases"" which I assume are present in where you're getting the fluid you're dispensing?  Once you get the numbers sorted, it should be pretty trivial to have your +/- controls go up or down 3% at a time.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNWN4d3JjX1pyV2tmNElYZVpfd2FTczZnLUU3cy0wTTg4TG85cEl5SHlpV0VhZ2QtdGYyTTRHOE40amtLQ1B6R2xUc2Qxa200ZTdqMkJBNWkxQkVxNXc9PQ==

"It got better, but it's still not perfect. After the initial pushback from what I mentioned for the requirements for industrial control cabinets, they moved to a Cal calculation method, which ideally was better but the problem was that a lot of vendors/companies didn't adopt it or implement it correctly. So it's been revised again. 

The part I'm talking about was there were hard requirements around AC/DC voltage. AC voltage above a certain voltage (it was either like 42, 45 or 55VAC I can't remember) would push it into the next category of ARC Flash requirements. DC voltage above 60VDC I believe was similar on that end.

So using the metric established in the NFPA 70E at the time and applying it to a common residential task, since you are changing a light bulb if the switch is off but the breaker is on you'd still have to suit up. Regardless of breaker size/trip speed. 

The NFPA 70E really needs to change how it looks at voltages and energies in a control cabinet. It needs to treat 120VAC on 20amp or less circuits different than it does 480vac three phase systems but it doesn't. Their goal was to try and isolate DC safe areas from 480vac areas or other higher voltage equipment but the problem that you run into is that 120vac is used to provide power to the DC power supplies and such, along with used for a lot of standard equipment for power (including the laptop programing power outlet.)

"Sure. If there were layers that resisted deforming (i.e. were stiff) or created space between the magic puncture-proof layer and the person, that would help. But in that case, what does the magic layer add? If a material is stiff and hard, it generally resists puncturing pretty well on its own. 

But it occurs to me that if a band of puncture-resistant, non-stretching material were wrapped entirely around somebody's arm, say, then the tension loads from a bullet strike wouldn't be so localized, but rather distributed around the entire band. The effect would be enhanced if the band were pretensioned somehow, perhaps by expanding foam layered under the layer. That would reduce deformation.

">The only reason for using electrical transmissions are for ease of combining prime movers. Hybrid cars & diesel locomotives are the common examples. 

The reasons in these two cases are actually pretty different. In diesel locomotives, It's because the extreme gear reduction needed to start a freight train gets to the point where it's easier and more reliable to convert to electric.

In hybrid cars, it's to enable operating the engine closer to its peak efficiency point. It's typical for the average efficiency of the engine over a driving cycle to be about half the efficiency operating at its peak efficiency point. That's pathetic and opens an opportunity for a better system even if that system involves more energy conversion steps with losses in each.

>Locked mechanical transmissions have near-zero losses.

Yes, and this is why the series only hybrid has not become popular. The Volt was close to a series hybrid but still have a mode where it could deliver direct power mechanically to the wheels from the engine at highway speed.

For the free piston idea to be viable, we would need the improvements in efficiency from the free piston setup to be counteract the losses inefficiency that are inherent in a series hybrid.

And while the stuff that you can avoid with a free piston does have losses, those are not the dominant losses in an internal combustion engine so the possible improvement is limited.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTUZERkFsRXZJbUlnZ0J5dGk0REFHZlRtZEwwaEdoVGtjOFY2OGd3V1doMUEtVzVMR0VCNjd0UWp2czBQbGFJd2hJQndhaXdoQ2tqZExSeFRzNVRIT0E9PQ==

"It's a fun concept and could have some advantages. But I think that the statement that it gets rid of most of the mechanical losses is exaggerated. First of all, most of the losses aren't actually mechanical losses but are thermal losses and pumping losses, the energy required to pump the air through the engine.  And secondly, a lot of the mechanical losses are friction of the piston sliding in the cylinder.

"Simplest case is an antenna broadcasting power equally in all directions, a so called omnidirectional antenna.

Imagine this antenna is at the center of a spherical bubble.  All of the power broadcast by the antenna has to pass through this bubble.  If this bubble were a receiving antenna it would capture all the power.

Here’s the trouble: we can’t surround that transmitting antenna with a spherical all-encompassing bubble.  The best we can do is build a receiving antenna with an effective area.  Imagine, if instead of a bubble, we tried to capture some of that power with a big sheet.  The amount of power we capture is the product of that sheets area (the “receiving aperture”) times the power density.

What’s power density?  Remember the big bubble around the transmitter?  It has surface area of 4piR^2 with R being the distance from the antenna to the bubble surface.  All of that transmitter power is spread across the surface of the bubble, so the power density is power divided by area, or P/(4piR^2 ).

The power you will capture with your receiver is  PA/(4piR^2 ) where A is the effective area of your receiving antenna.

Let’s run some numbers: suppose the transmit power is 1 million watts, and you are 10 km away with a 10 m^2 aperture.  You will capture a little less than 0.01 watts- one one hundred millionth of what was broadcast!

The situation can be improved a bit using directional antennas, but the R-squared loss is a killer.

What if we used a laser, you ask?  If the laser is very tightly collimated and the receiving  aperture is big enough to cover the entire beam at distance (it will spread a bit), in principle all of the transmitter power could be captured, ignoring transmission loss due to absorption and scattering of the beam between transmitter and receiver.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNzVoS0pRZnlpWklnWDlzT0o0VHZHWnA4c2hjQ0FucF9sX1lzSzlQeGtQWlhpTUltcEowWG1FVXFDQXctVW5yVFZ6eXgwUkxTR1BFS05TSkM1MFVhZWc9PQ==

"There's a bit of marketing fluff there, lidar usually refers to a swept beam or multi-dimensional scan that builds up a depth image in 2 or more dimensions, but most are still based on a ToF technology. ToF is just the technique that it uses, though the beam steering aspect is another kettle of fish. Basically, if you have a rangefinder that uses a time of flight technique, marketing may call that a TOF rangefinder, if you point that rangefinder at a moving mirror (or spin it around) and use it to make a depth image, you have a lidar. Same technology, same technique, just called something different by application. 

Additionally, lidar (and rangefinders) don't necessarily need to be infrared, though they usually are - turns out light sensors in silicon are cheap to make to be responsive to 905nm, which is infrared, and you get some eye safety benefits as well, but you could theoretically use any wavelength you wanted so long as you found a transmitter and receiver that worked at that frequency.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNFVER25GemRYY3NkYU14aGtZT1Iydndta2Y4THRVaUx2Zlh5THNHZkNNRVU3T2otNTFMVWJrSzZPa0VneFhUcThBbDRJWEhtNnRCbVUyNmJvZGtLbkE9PQ==

"The word you are missing is stereoscopy, or binocular vision - using displacement along epipolar lines across multiple viewpoints to estimate depth. That is both popular and successful at short ranges in controlled environments, but stereo vision is really annoying - calibration needs to be ridiculously good, and you need stupid resolution and large baselines to get good depth for anything resembling long-range sensing.

It is actually possible to get depth information from a single camera, it's not uncommon for things like cell phone apps - you can definitely throw machine learning at the problem, but it will have weird failure modes. The traditional way to do it is called structure from motion (SfM), which tracks how a camera is moving through space and measures how it changes the image. Usually with a few key points in each frame you can get a reasonable depth approximation, and you can do some form of visual odometry to sort of bootstrap the motion estimation aspect (or IMUs are cheap but bad over longer periods), but it does require that the camera moves in reasonably useful ways.

You can also throw out a light pattern that the camera can see and measure how the pattern gets warped by the scene and use that to estimate depth - that's a structured light scanner, and that is how the Kinect worked. Not so hot in direct sunlight, but it takes oodles less processing and gives a pretty nice depth image.

"> Should I be looking at technician jobs at this point rather than engineering roles? What are my options?

Just do both. In the ideal case, you can get an entry level engineer role. If asked about the gap, just say that there was a personal issue that is now resolved and it won't affect your performance going forward. Any good HR person or hiring manager would drop it at that.

Unfortunately, you're still competing with a bunch of fresh grads, and entry level roles have always been difficult to get. Getting a technician job in the meanwhile to gain hands on experience is valuable if you approach it as a learning experience. What I mean is that you should approach it with humility--don't treat it as an embarrassment and that it's beneath you. You'd just make yourself miserable with that attitude, and others will notice as well.

You can continue applying for engineering roles while working as a technician. It's a lot easier to get a job when you already have a job. At the same time, leverage your technician job: do a good job and try to get promoted to an engineer, or at least network with your coworkers. Even if you're not working as an ""engineer"", you'd still work with them and can observe and learn from them.

You're not in an either/or situation. You need to try everything all at once to give yourself the most opportunities to get over this roadblock. I'm speaking from personal experience having done this exact same thing.

So, this is a shitty situation because customers normally shouldn’t get directly involved with an investigation like this.

You usually go through your insurance company and only if they don’t pay what they are supposed to pay, or you don’t like the treatment they gave you, then you get a lawyer involved.  It’s usually counterproductive to pursue anything yourself.  In fact, the moment you touched the evidence and modified the battery, it became likely any legal case you might have wanted to bring to court would get dismissed automatically because of spoliation of evidence. 

The insurance company is free to use whatever resources they have  at their disposal for subrogation.  If they so choose, they can hire an expert to investigate.  In that case, the other side will also hire an expert, etc.  then both experts have to agree to an inspection protocol, and the other side has to be in attendance. A typical inspection of evidence will have lawyers from both sides, and experts from both sides. Sometimes it gets settled, other times goes to court. 

If you are not satisfied with what has happened so far, i would immediately talk to a lawyer and cease any further communication with anyone.

"Generally speaking larger diameter wheels, particularly of the same width, suffer less loss from rolling resistance and encountering obstacles on an uneven road surface.

"It seems you are confusing the energy \\*contained\\* in a moving object and the amount of power required to \\*maintain\\* that motion. You are kind of on the right track towards figuring out that there's more energy \\*contained\\* in the rotation of a bigger wheel, but that isn't particularly important, for two reasons:

Firstly, there is a lot more energy contained in the forward motion of the frame and your body (which can weigh upwards of 100 kg combined) than in the rotation of the wheels (which weigh a few kg at most), so when you are accelerating, most of the effort goes towards getting the heavy things moving, not the wheels rotating. Also, it turns out that that the size of the wheel cancels out of the formulas (all else being equal): bigger wheels store more energy for the same RPM, but bigger wheels rotate slower for the same forward speed.

Secondly, once you're up to speed it doesn't really matter how much energy is stored in the system; what matters is how much power you need to keep putting in to keep it moving. To maintain constant speed on level ground, you have to defeat friction and air resistance. Friction depends on many factors, like how hard or soft your tires are and how well-lubed your chain in, and the size of the wheel may play a role here, but it's not clear-cut how and how much. And in any case, air resistance will matter much more at higher speeds, and there the size of the tires matters pretty much not at all.

If you're after formulas, here's a summary:

(Energy contained in forward motion) = ½ \\* (mass, you + bicycle) \\* (speed)\\^2

(Energy contained in spinning wheels) = ½ \\* (number of wheels) \\* (mass, wheel) \\* (speed)\\^2 \\* (number that depends on how much of the mass is in the rim and how much is closer to the hub)

(Power lost to friction) = (speed) \\* (difficult-to-compute factor that mainly depends on the softness of your tires) + (speed) \\* (difficult-to-compute number that mainly depends on how well-lubed things are)

(Power lost to air resistance) = (speed + wind speed)\\^3 \\* (density of the air) \\* (difficult-to-compute factor that depends on how aerodynamic you are)

(Extra power needed to go uphill) = (speed) \\* (steepness, rise over run) \\* (mass, you + bicycle) \\* (strength of gravity)

Wind speed and steepness can be negative in the last two to account for tailwind and downhill, respectively.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX0xmWmRzX29STnVvdE14UzhTeUNpNmp1b3k5cVg0dm1ja0p6WVIzbE1iTldpcU5rSXZLMkQxeWVHd1ZDVDhFTHFRVmh5c2IyaTN2aWdESnBqbXFHeVE9PQ==

But I'm not an expert in this stuff in any way, so next to just thinking about things this setup could possibly provide I'm trying to fish for it's downsides.

"**disclosure: I'm a Ph.D. battery engineer and worked on building lead-acid batteries for over 10 years. My interpretation are private and no way legal.**  
Lead-acid batteries in cars (ICE engine) are mostly flooded type where there is excess electrolyte (dilute sulfuric acid) in the battery. At almost all times these batteries are at full or almost full charge SoC. The electrolyte density (specific gravity) changes when battery is fully charged or discharged. When battery is fully discharged (deep discharged) it still has a voltage of about 10.5V (1.75V per cell) but the electrolyte density drops close to 1 g/cm3 (density of water). When it is fully charged, it has a density of about 1.28-1.30 g/cm3. In these density ranges, I can guarantee that the electrolyte is not capable of melting a hole in any material that the car is made out of.
Flooded batteries can have hydrogen gas accumulation during its cycling and that can potentially catch fire if conditions are right. But I have only seen one instance of such battery explosion in my 10 year career in lab (and that too was a prototype battery with faulty busbar).  
Ask them what was the battery acid density and that can tell if battery has any charge. I bet if firefighters droused the battery with water and the seal was compromised, that test is unreliable since water got mixed with electrolyte and then the density of acid will be lower.  
Anyhow, I don't expect the battery voltage to be 0V unless it is shorted. If shorted the acid density can still be higher. Examining the electrodes (anode and cathode) visually and chemically can tell if the battery was charged or discharged when it was damaged. Electrodes color changes when it is charged and discharged and so does it's chemical composition. In charged state, negative electrode is metallic lead while positive electrode is lead dioxide. In discharged state both electrodes are lead sulfate. Examination of separator is needed to find short (dendrite) if shorting happened.

"[It's one of my favorite things I ever learned in school.](https://aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/q0224.shtml) Looking at a bit of air as it travels out and away from the engine nozzle, its pressure is high so it expands and gasses expand away from the exhaust center axis. They do this so fast that momentum causes them to over expand, effectively creating a vacuum along the exhaust center axis, which causes the outwardly traveling exhaust gasses to slow and reverse direction back towards the exhaust center axis. When they get there, the momentum of their inward velocity causes them to compress, even to the point of recombustion or heating to the point of glowing. Then the cycle repeats. 

I basically just repeated what the person above said but focused more on momentum because that's easier to understand my favorite, favorite thing about this: if you were to examine a hockey-puck shaped bit of exhaust gas as it travels out and away from the engine nozzle, what you see is basically that hockey puck shape bit of exhaust gas going [boing-oing-oing-oing-oing-oing](https://aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/shock-diamonds/overexpansion.jpg) as it travels along.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTk0teDJJTUF5TmM3NDFjLWQxbzZnODF1ZUhQQjRuUTY0WFhyVDJjWHptTGZLQ1Myczg5UnVyQnRSY01rTjVHRExHV2drVkpfTWd1UDZic2ttdGx3NUE9PQ==

"CRTs are only illuminating a point at the time, which means they have problems getting to really high resolutions at high refresh rates. CRTs don't have low persistence, they are deliberately made with high persistence. 

The inherent blurriness of the electron beam can give you the impression of having a smoother/sharper image than you actually do (just like for chemical film), your brain is filling in the missing information. 

(Tip for anyone watching movies with a projector: Adjust focus until you can see the individual pixels, then adjust it out of focus just enough so the boundaries between pixels disappear.)

Plasma screens for a while were the best you could get. The technology can be compared to having one CRT per pixel. They had better darkness, better colors and higher contrast range than anything else out there. But they lost out to LCDs on price.

In theory, you could get what you ask for in  plasma screen, but this is no longer a technology in production. 

The best hope for better screen quality in the future is OLEDs, but that is still much more expensive than LCD. Micro LEDs may push this even further.

Salespeople get taught to sell something based on potential purposes and not to discuss the specs. The two languages are opposite.) 

I am also dogging on the fact that the sales portion of vehicles is so strong, that its basically impossible to get a tech manual or basic specifications that aren’t on the front of the advert sheet.

This is supposed to be a fun tongue in cheek, not serious. I think most commenters have picked up on that. I am always nice and respectful to salespeople. Though, when I bought my first car at 16, the car salesman laid the pitch on so thick that I got overwhelmed and started bawling. It’d be nice to return the favor someday ;P 

PS. I bought my car elsewhere after that.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSTNsQmtQanUzODBnTlJYblVFd0oxVHc5QVhDZ0ZTZW5BdFJKRzJVQmM1cXhHSWpJazhsMmljcDJVbE9tbGhUakxfaVNNZ2laRzZfZlNUYU5uMGtMNEE9PQ==
"Probably easier to just GMO your way into plants that need less water. 


Pending that, you're looking at a pretty complex system.


Heres a link to Wikipedia article for breaking lengths of different materials under their own weight (assuming a uniform thickness of rope) 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_strength


The jet steam is at 9.1km, so it doesn't seem that high, but this rules out most of the metallic cable materials. 


Now keep in mind this tether needs to support more than it's own weight. It needs to well tether something AND transport 9.1km of water at a reasonable flow rate.


So let's assume you want to water a 1 acre greenhouse. You need ~83m3 of water a day, or 288L/min of water. 


https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://nurserycrops.ces.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/water-supply-and-water-quality-for-nursery-GH-crops-Bilderback-dole-sneed.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwi73LXdgKiHAxV5rokEHa8UB7oQ9cILegQIDxAA&usg=AOvVaw0ckP1KvfcRCdpji7EILbsv


So to keep that flow rate below 2.5m/s (roughly the max speed you want in a pipe) you would need a 2in pipe that could handle ~76bar of pressure. 


Surprisingly you can do this with sch 10 carbon steel pipe. 


So the pipe would weigh (not including the water) would be ~2.5ton 


You have to support this off your tether because the pipe can't support it'self that far. 


Needless to say it's quite the problem, and this is as much math as I want to do",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMmpkSGE3OUx0MVJWUmpzUFB1WGp1Vlg1ck5BanlyaEJDT0o5dElxb1prSVZGd29OcEJMSTRRMnRpSUkzNkVzUnJqa3dVTzMtUDkyQ25jWGN2MG9uVWc9PQ==

"Yes, as someone else suggested, since there are 6 individual cells in the 12V battery and you registered a 9.87V it is likely that one cell is shorted somehow. Lead acid batteries are very resilient temperature wise so I don't think 30C or even 60 or 70C can do any damage to the battery.
How old was this battery. Reason, I'm asking is because electrodes in these batteries expand and contract during cycling and can deform internally and that can cause shorting from edges touching. Electrodes (plates) itself are made on a lead grid that can have sharp edges and those can puncture the polyethylene separator to cause the short. Another way a short can happen is if separator has tiny pinhole where metal dendrite grows during cycling of battery and eventually it will short.
I still suggest that someone (battery manufacturer) should carefully evaluate all the individual cells and find the actual issue by careful dissection of the problem cell and check for separator short and/or any electrode defect.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT3Q1LURJV3NzXzU0aVNKQWYxTUhOOXhLOVJmVG91QTIwdGhHVXFqWmpvdW1tMGdBb0ZOa2tKOUdMRTBNZjRLdHhKN0FobUFua0hUempBbXBkd3Y2TmJCZ3VwYjQwMU90R3Z4anJ4cGRQMFU9

"> But you have to remember the reason the vehicles are being produced, which (as far as I’m aware) to replace ICE vehicles and reduce emissions.

True, but producing the huge Li-ion battery packs for EV's still has a huge carbon footprint, and the recyclability of those Batteries is really bad as well. So finding a good middle ground between ICEs and EVs could be really beneficial for the mean time when better battery technology is being developed. 

As far as I know hybrids are pretty good at that, having much better efficiency compared to conventional ICE cars, while maintaining the upsides of them. So I guess the main competition a linear piston powered car is looking at are the existing hybrids instead of EV's.

"I don't see why Toyota wouldn't implement a battery tbh, free piston generator are supposedly very compact, so space wouldn't really be an issue. Having a reasonable battery pack would allow you to operate the engine at it's peak efficiency 100% of the time that it's operating at all. And whenever turned off you could just drive on the stored power.

I think the biggest drawback is the energy conversion loss. but having no mechanical drivetrain and very few moving parts in the engine itself, together with running the engine at peak efficiency 100% of its operational time, could outweigh those conversion losses.

I'm trying to find out wether or not it can actually do that, since the concept seems like it could actually provide some real benefits.

"Usually its highly uneconomical to run a pump at high flow velocities unless its required by design.

Your pressure losses go up by velocity squared, so there's a massive difference between 2m/s or 4m/s. 

He is completly right about keeping it below 2m/s for the PIPING as a rule of thumb. 7 m/s is insane if your job is to just generally move fluids around and no other technological reason require high flows. Your pressure losses are insane and paying way more than you need to.

Emphasis on the piping.

For pumps in the last decade or two there is a large tendency from pump manufacturers to undersize their nozzles. This means cheaper manufacturing costs for them and for the users a 100% required reducer for the piping right after the nozzle to go up a size or two. If you don't you are shooting yourself or whoever you design the system for in the foot.

It's okay for the exit nozzle to have a higher velocity such as 4m/s but right after you use reducers to go down below 2m/s generally.

Varieble Frequency Drive btw. And it's not a be-all-end-all solution as the ranges it can correct economically is limited.

You still need to properly select a pump taking the entire system curve into consideration including minor and major losses.",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaHlKdUNmUUgwUS1KSjhCY1pkZkJfODl3NUEwLTZzUV9hOU1MblJkeVJvM0hXbFRUTktyNzQ0R1RlMHVzVlFrWkM5X1czTXpUVTh6THJ1TnNMWGJjS0tEUWZ2cy1xQ0EtS0N0UFNnY0l0VTg9
"A sketch would help.

It sounds like you're trying to perfectly match the pump flow rate to the tower outflow to prevent overflow, if that's the case, that's a fools errand. Especially by adjusting pipe size.

"Exist nozzle velocity being 4m/s is ok. You immedietly use reducers to go up a size or two in the piping to reduce flow rate.

Alternatively you can order pumps with larger nozzles (i know grundfos does this). Depends on your budget and connections to the supplier.

"Check out Agent J Z’s channel on YouTube. The business he is associated with is all about gas turbine engines used for industrial power, mostly for pumping oil and gas because they are located in northwestern Canada. He also rebuilds vintage fighter jet engines. The point is that gas turbines ARE used frequently for industrial power. The choice of which type of generator to use in which application is probably subject to lots of considerations, but I suspect that at least some gas turbines are used in some refineries. I know of one natural gas pipeline that has a pumping station next to a highway rest stop that I visit.

"Hello Everyone,

I am looking for advice or guidance on an engineering career or a career that I would be able to use an engineering degree on. Just as a heads up I have a few questions that I want to ask and would deeply appreciate it if any of you can give me any insight. I am located in the northern part of Illinois (north of Chicago). To start off I graduated from college in the spring of 2016 with a mechanical engineering degree and honestly I have not worked in the engineering field at all. The jobs I have been working have been physical labor jobs with the exception of working an office job for around two years (Engineering Associate but after working there for a while the manager who hired me said that the job was not an actual engineering job, it was basically being a paper pusher) and my most recent job as of right now is being a package delivery courier (AMZ).

Is it too late to pursue an engineering career at this point?

Is an engineering degree from 2016 even worth it?

When I was in school I didn’t bother to apply for internships because I noticed that my grades/GPA didn’t meet the requirements. Now all these years later I’ve basically forgotten most of what I learned regarding coding and all the skills that I believe will be needed (coding was never my strong suit and my CAD/solidworks knowledge is practically non-existent). As for practical skills I really have none either (mechanic/welder/anything handyman wise/electrician or electronics/or even computer maintenance).

What types of non-engineering jobs/careers would I be able to pursue with an engineering degree?

Those of you who don’t have a degree but a very well-paying job, what did/do you do?

Please, I need some feedback/insight/suggestions on what I should do. Anything and everything will help. If you want to send words of encouragement or even if you want to tell me off for wasting so much time and money go right ahead. I just need something.

Thank You",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWUs4QW16T2NuWWpoVXNYTm51cjBRYko0TFdXQ0VFbS1QS3JfOHhKbXJ5MmVPLTB2VXQ1S3dCNndVX0hCYlV6dTAwamVTU0ZNR2lnMDlqbFZBY2JlcGc9PQ==

"A lot of this is looking back with rose-tinted glasses. Thomas Edison made one of the largest companies in the US, General Electric. General Electric has been massive, and for a while (even until relatively recently) was THE largest company in the US, and for a large part the world as well. 

A lot of inventing also happens under a company, and you don't really prescribe inventions to a company in the same way you do a person. Bhatt invented USB, one of the most prolific advancements in modern computing, but you don't really think about that. If anything, when you ask someone who invented USB, they'll say Intel. 

Another thing to consider is that a lot of modern products are evolutionary, not revolutionary. There aren't many prolific technologies that didn't exist, then suddenly exist. Rather, technology evolves over time, incorporating other new technologies, until at some point we call it X instead of Y. Take smartphones as an example, most people know of smartphones from Apple, but you can argue that IBM and the Simon Personal Communicator are really the ""first"" one.  But look at a Simon, and it is nothing like what we'd call a smartphone today post-Apple, and is really close to what a portable phone from the time look like. So who do we credit with that invention? Same goes for things like transistors, the most-produced thing in human history. Sure, one person made the first transistor, and that was a big deal, but they have evolved so much since then, based on the work of tens of thousands of people at thousands of companies, who do you credit with the invention of the ""modern transistor""?",r/askengineers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneUhPNURkUEZUVGpXTWN4ZlRMMFBxbHNKdi14eGhCMW5JOUswS0QzdjlGS2pOVnU1aG0xNmxuWi1UbFZVNC0yRVB3ZG1DUElBY0g0Xzk0TXBtMG9icUE9PQ==
"You could make each piece have a different conductivity with a simple resistor.

And the lead times for deployment or repair. There are lots of places to get electric motors, contactors, breakers, PLCs, VFDs, etc.

Where do you go to pick up a gas turbine to run the assembly line chain, when it reaches EoS? Take it down for rebuild? Keep a spare on hand? Get a Rebuilt exchange, with a core? It would require a monumental shift in the management of industrial power. It's not something that you could practically implement at just a single plant site.

A possible single plant option might be some universal steam turbine engine that could be used anywhere, and a central boiler to power them. Some industries actually have a centralized air compressor with lots of pneumatic actuators, but for long term motion, you probably need a turbine engine.

Either way, you're just trying to get power distributed over a plant site. Electricity seems very efficient at that, and electric motors and controls are available just about everywhere.
