I'm not calling the constructor, but a static \\`requestPermission()\\` function.

"Hi
At the moment it‚Äôs not possible for clickable hotspot interactions, from my understanding the reason is so that you‚Äôll be able to have the experience across multiple brands and ages of mobile devices and to make the file much lighter size wise. From my own experience testing other platforms that allow such interactions it seems that each ‚Äúinteraction‚Äù is actually a duplicate of the scene with one thing changed so each tap will quickly swap out one scene for another but then you end up with a massive file that gets streamed to the user slowing things down. It‚Äôs also computational pretty heavy so if you‚Äôre using an older phone the experience will not be smooth which could frustrate the user and then you lose their concentration. 
If I was to showcase a vehicle then I would have one door open so the user can peak in there, you can also have floating info boards with extra information, all in 3D. Keep it simple, you really don‚Äôt need full interaction because for most people just seeing something in AR is awesome enough, you don‚Äôt want to overload their brain. 
Remember that WorldCAST doesn‚Äôt focus on having all the bling that one could get by writing your own app because they try to reach a broader audience that might not have the best or latest phone not to mention the pain of having to write and app for both iPhone and Android. 
Good luck with your project and remember to think outside and around the box because that‚Äôs where the fun lies in creating AR content ü´°

"This article misstates the sales figures from the Bloomberg article that its reporting on. The actual article says ‚ÄúThe $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in a quarter since its launch in the US in February.‚Äù Not that they haven‚Äôt sold 100,000 units at all.
They already sold around 200,000 headsets in preorders before it even launched according to multiple sources https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/apple-vision-pro-headset-sales 

https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/22/vision-pro-sales-estimate/ 

The 100,000 sales number figure is for the quarter after it. The Bloomberg article cites the scale that the IDC used for the sales for each quarter, which shows them selling well over 100,000
units so far. https://imgur.com/a/P9U8x1d",r/augmentedreality,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWnN6R3dUeTBsUlQ4bk0zTkhfSkxyLS1sTXZuVFoxdFFCN0p0VDlVdEpqZDdvcWo5UDdXQklkRWYzZ0pXRHVLUWlTdEw5dDFyYndQcFZnRVBwbnFaUGc9PQ==

"Not for a product that‚Äôs $3500. The market consensus is that Apple sold around 200,000 units when it first came out, and according to the IDCs chart they sold slightly less than 100,000 units in the 2nd quarter, so let‚Äôs say about 70-80,000. At $3499, 280,000 headsets sold would be 979,720,000 in revenue, close to a billion dollars. It would also by default have to be a bit more than that since 3499 is for the bare minimum storage configuration for the Vision Pro and some of the units sold were the 512 and 1TB models which cost more.
In contrast, the quest 3 has sold 1 million units bare minimum, we know this because a game that is a Q3 exclusive recently reached 1 million players. https://www.uploadvr.com/quest-3-sold-at-least-1-million-units/
According to numerous polls, only about 60% of quest 3 owners have played it, so the number of quest 3‚Äôs sold is likely between 1.5-2million. Let‚Äôs be generous and say its 2 million, that would be 998,000,000 in revenue for meta, extremely close to the 979,720,000 in revenue Apple would make from selling 280,000 AVPs.

"If you want to be on top of tech you should follow display and sensor technology news.

If you want to see which companies are drawing up plans for new AR devices using those new displays/sensors you need to look at patents for those companies. Leading AR/VR product makers (Valve/Meta/Samsung/Sony, etc) try different things and cover all bases using new and upcoming technology, and you see it in patents.

These links are mostly display technology related, and include TVs, phones, laptops, but also AR/VR.

"QR codes can be very inaccurate in some situations when used in isolation (especially for rotation), unless you‚Äôre careful about accounting for projection errors, etc.  Often times other methods for alignment are used, especially if you need high accuracy. 

The ML2 reports 2cm tracking accuracy for the headset/world reconstruction. I‚Äôm not up to speed on the latest research, but there are some machine learning and other statistical techniques that can report better (I‚Äôm not sure exactly the constraints of those results either, such as how hardware drift impacts it). But out of the box using a QR code on the ML2 will not get you millimeter accuracy. 

But, depending on your specific use case, there are factors to consider beyond the inherent accuracy of a method.

1. I had a little sign printed up, but that did a shitty job of grabbing attention because my art is like, insanely maximalist in content and color, and there were a few dozen illustrations hanging. So I just said hey if you're interested in playing with an experimental animation thing, check this out...

2. It definitely pushed a couple people from interested to definitely buying. I didn't try to sell the AR experience as a service.

3. I did book a booth; the organizers for this maker market do lots of them in my area and are refreshingly open about how to apply, which is absolutely not the case for most markets. Honestly, most of the time it's best to just ask vendors at events how they got hooked up and they'll happily give you some leads. I've noticed that most maker markets don't even advertise until they are full, which is pretty gatekeepy whether or not that's the intention. The organizers I work with are very much in the new wave of craft fairs and encourage applying openly, always have their own booth to advertise future events, have live music, just overall making sure everyone has a good time and great experience.

>At the same time, Google continues to see a stream of exits following layoffs and leadership reshuffles. Jeffrey Margolis, a principal AR architect at Google who previously helped Microsoft build its HoloLens headsets, left the company last month for Meta to work on future AR glasses, according to a person with direct knowledge of the move.

>Some other Google employees have also defected to Meta in recent months, that person said, adding that some of these moves happened due to frustration with Google's constant pivoting and the fact it laid off employees working on AR back in January.

>Mark Lucovsky, a senior director on Google's AR software, left last July, citing ""changes in AR leadership and Google's unstable commitment and vision"" to the product. Paul Greco, who oversaw the optical technology Google acquired with the startup Raxium in 2022, also left Google for a job in Meta's XR group.",r/augmentedreality,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVmROYnA5d2ViQUVTdEZacFdxVUkySkJndVI3Nnc5LWJuVU9RTkM2eFdDaUNSaGxKMnk2aFVtd0JkWGJLd1lVNTlxb01UbmJoZEFlQWZYSVM2Um5ETlE9PQ==
