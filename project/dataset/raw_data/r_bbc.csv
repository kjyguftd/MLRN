"It's two channels, broadly the same. Until a couple of years back it was BBC World News and BBC News for the worldwide and domestic channel respectively. World News is funded purely through advertisement as it cannot be funded by the licence fee. 

However budget cuts consolidated the two channels together, with 'opt outs' for the Worldwide channel at certain times of day (breakfast and national news bulletins in the UK for instance at 0600, 1300, 1800 and 2200 GMT don't get aired internationally) - instead a world programme goes out to the world.

"Totally get ya! I guess having watched way too many crime/cop/detective shows, I thought the message was pretty obvious because they tend to follow the same formula. The example that sticks in my mind is Marcella. Except in Marcella, it's done way way worse lol. Different outlooks are part of what makes fiction interesting, though, so everyone will have different opinions!

And again, fiction can explore multiple outcomes with no consequence. I don't think there's one ""correct"" answer to how someone would act in that situation in real life, let alone the infinite possibilite of fiction. However I do know that one can break out of an episode like that just as easily as they went into it. It doesn't mean they stay that way forever, and it doesn't mean they were always like that before either.  The logical portion of her came back and said, ""I should be punished."" 

Most most importantly that I think I left out, writing a show isn't the same as thinking every character is good and wholesome. The writers aren't trying to say, ""Abi is correct and we think everyone who kills their baby should be forgiven."" More like, two of these three women can change their course in life, but the other can't.

"Many jobs at the BBC are fixed term so loads of people get their first 'in' by starting with a short fixed-term role and, once they have a foot in the door, moving around the teams and departments until they find an area that suits them. Fixed-term contracts are always a risk because there's never any guarantee that you'll find another role at the end, but it's the same in most industries I guess. 

  
Don't limit yourself to presenter jobs when you're looking for an 'in' - they are few and far between - but you can start elsewhere and move across with time. With your marketing background, you could look at researcher or content roles across a wide range of teams. 

The BBC have an 80/20 scheme that gives permanent staff the chance to spend time (from a few months up to a year) working across other teams they're interested in. They also have a Hot Shoes scheme where you can spend a week or two working alongside a team in a completely different area of the BBC if you want to. 

There are quite a few apprenticeship schemes - Higher, Degree and Masters. Applications open in Autumn 2024 for September 2025 start dates: [https://careers.bbc.co.uk/content/EC\\_FAQs/?locale=en\\_GB](https://careers.bbc.co.uk/content/EC_FAQs/?locale=en_GB)

Ignore people who say the BBC is elitist or that you have to know someone to stand a chance of getting in. It may have been like that in the past but that was never my experience. DO make sure you read all the latest BBC guidance on completing their job applications - they changed the marking criteria not so long ago to try to make it fairer for external candidates but if you don't follow the structure they advise or structure your applications to address key words in the job description, your application won't make it through the first sift by HR, meaning none of the actual hiring managers will even see your CV before it ends up in the bin!

TLDR: Don't wait until your 'perfect' BBC presenter role comes up - find a job in another department and work your way up / across. 

  
Good luck!",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhZHZSTng1dEM0NEdfQXFhX1d0N0hRS0llaUttVGVYY3ZOUlR2dkJlNUJEN3o4WDNWd2h2U3dWOWdOOXp0T3VvcEV6TFhLT3FibHBrSjVCSEdMbTd5Nnc9PQ==

"The BBC's initiative to engage in co-productions, exemplified by collaborations like Doctor Who, is a strategic effort to generate increased revenue through commercial avenues. This approach aims to mitigate the reliance on funding from the licence fee, particularly in light of the recent government decision to freeze the licence fee.

Mandating the BBC to prioritize viewership exclusively, thereby producing content solely attractive to advertisers or paying subscribers, would result in a significant reduction in programming that caters to minority audiences or unconventional formats not viable on commercial networks. The American television model operates in this manner, and as a consequence, numerous exceptional programs have been prematurely cancelled due to a lack of immediate popularity.",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2RmpBQkhlbUMtaGdEX1ZRQkhXOE1zLXpsVWVsNHhLMm5HS3NtOUhJNXFXZjF2RTlvUERwN0h5VzVSbE1aZVQyaHQwTlZTV25kV2lZMGJONWJBRUlhTUE9PQ==

"Disney part-funds Dr Who. This isn't what the BBC want, it's because the lisence fee is too low to fund competitive international-quality programming.

For news and current affairs, funding from other companies could be extremely problematic.

The BBC should probably be funded directly from the govornment's budget, as it's a powerful media force and valuable public service. But for now the lisence fee remains. Underfunding the BBC is something the previous govornment were very keen on, as they didn't like being held to account so often by BBC journalists.",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3QWdmS3lwd2VZb3hSSHVYMUZfeC1FWVV6UHRlWHpVS1A5ZHd3M3ZYTFctWW55SEh5YWdWUnZUaWhQVmI5bTZWN0VEOXh5dWhDcm5qbGctTXFUMnhDVUE9PQ==
"These two comments are great. I'd also add that co-productions between multiple broadcasters/media providers is quite common. They all chip in some money to make a single show and in return they get the distribution rights in their home market. 

In the case of Doctor Who, BBC is the UK distributor, and Disney+ distributes it everywhere else. The extra money means the BBC can do so much more than they would have been able to do alone, and they still get the same outcome as they have always had (ie, showing Doctor Who on UK TV).

Other context worth sharing:

1. Bluey (literally the biggest kids show in the world, 29% of ALL viewing on Disney+) is co-founded by the BBC and ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation). In this case, Disney are just outright paying for streaming rights rather than co-producing, so BBC Studios (separate legal entity from BBC Public Service, and allowed to turn a profit) are making money off Disney.

2. One not unreasonable comparison for the license fee is the NHS. We all pay for it, even if we don't use it, because then it's there for the people that can't afford it (eg: old people on Pension Credit). In practice, the people that can't afford it technically shouldn't be watching, but they still get all the benefits of radio, the News website/app, BBC Bitesize in schools etc.",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3RXhBX3FKWEhLdUFEUHpvemVYU1U2Yl9WaW0tTmpiSGJZdUVpUGVXS1VUMnFtV1pPTk9FcTRXVUFvcE5fTGFaQWhNeTdUekJjaWtmRk16VlBPUkI4UHc9PQ==
"If the BBC was advertiser funded, it would ruin the corporation. Let's say they ran regular ads like most other TV broadcasters. They might advertise brands such as Flora, Cadbury, Samsung, etc. what if Panorama's research team found that Cadbury was involved in a huge scandal? They might choose to expose this scandal, but Cadbury might pull their adverts, or bribe them to keep quiet. Now that important panorama episode won't air. 

Also what about things like the shipping forecast? Hardly anyone listens to that, but those who do rely on that information for safety and their business. That sort of programme could never work under an advert supported system, but it is vital it carries on. 

What about advertising on Cbeebies? I'm sure some companies would love the chance to put their brands in front of toddlers to manipulate them when they are most vulnerable.

Just to be clear, I don't think the current system is perfect at all. Making the licence fee a criminal issue feels very wrong, and the BBC is definitely not free from potential bribery and influence. But the current model at least avoids the influence of brands and corporations which I personally think is a very good thing. If there is any reform considered for the BBC, it should definitely be free from advertising at any cost.

On the Disney front, it's really no different than what the BBC has been doing for years. Disney paid for the rights to show Dr Who outside the UK, that is a deal that has been done many times in the past. As a long time Dr Who fan and a follower of the works of RTD I don't think there was much Disney influence in the latest season really, maybe some increase in the budget, but it's very similar to what we saw with His Dark Materials, which was also made by Bad Wolf Studios. The only direct thing I've seen was the Dr singing a Disney song in one episode.",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3a1JPQldjQURlZ3dVaVROeUxzU1NuMG5ENHZKc19yXzk3VnpBV3lzLUlLc3laSUFhNTZCcjRfbExXaFlsV0I2bjI0YS1NWVNCc2hjdzVkWnFQU1RaUXc9PQ==

"BBC News covers local news around the world. The BBC News division is still the largest news organisation in the world, although its local coverage worldwide has taken a hit since 2010 due to government cuts.

The BBC’s US news division is still substantial as US news and specifically US politics affects the whole world, not just the USA.

In regards to US coverage in America, yes I think there is a fair bit of interest in US news, again, especially politics. Presidential elections specifically are closely followed in the UK. And sorry for all the emphasis, but with trump in the running and looking like he may torpedo world peace and the rules based order of the modern world, it’s especially important this election. 

Thirdly, people in Europe and the UK are probably more interested in overseas affairs as the are more worldly and travelled people. In the US, there is enough domestic news that you could just look at US news all day long, whereas, European news coverage is much more nationalised and therefore there are less stories overall, there’s also just more cultural integration meaning people in the uk care about things outside their own country.",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFZmR0cEhKUnQ3WjFtY1dQUmJEQUt3aFdMZ21jOHlwQWxmb21uRlRkUmtfLXNqdGsxWmNmamlyNmdiVHByQ0Vsa3ZXbUxBeXhZZDFMRUFidEF5TkczZUE9PQ==

"They weren't trying to make her seem innocent, they were trying to display that she was \\*not okay with killing her child.\\* She did ask for help, we saw her conveying to her husband that she needed help. She asked the nurse for help and was told off. It wasn't trying to make the character seem \\*correct\\*, but to show that she was in agony inside because she didn't feel like she deserved to grieve. She very explicitly agrees with your opinion - that she is, herself, a horrible person who doesn't deserve compassion. She never tried to tell anyone she was innocent. Even while she's finally telling everyone her story, she makes it clear that she knows other women cope with worse things and don't kill their kids. Never once does she defend herself.  Simply tells the story as it happened. Sure, she hoped some people would connect with the loneliness of anger of new motherhood, but she wasn't hoping everyone would say, ""oh yeah I get it, you're forgiven.""

The other women make it clear as well that they don't forgive her, but they won't try to harm her anymore. I think they could have delved deeper into that. I think this is a topic where most audiences need a looooot of hand-holding to fully grasp. Seeing more of the discussion before Abi walked in would have been great.

Also, I feel like a lot of people are missing one simple thing: she didn't kill herself because she felt she deserved to live in pain knowing what she did. It wasn't because she felt she deserved better than her child, it's that she didn't feel she deserved the comfort of death.

Everything that led up to her committing murder was circumstantial. The loneliness, the being turned away when asking for help. This is something that happens in real life. No matter what you think of the morality of it, it's a real thing that women go through - constantly asking for help, being ignored, and then when they snap they are screamed at for supposedly not finding help. The point is that no one knows what anyone else is capable of when they're at their wits' end.

Again fiction is a way to explore these things, and Time explored it ""okay"" I think. It felt really rushed for all the feelings it wanted to portray. You have three women in prison with different children-related problems as the overall theme. Kelsey's ends up happy, we don't get to know Orla's ultimate outcome but I'd say she's mid. And they left Abi hanging at ""barely surviving.""",r/bbc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpaGJVQkxpa1pSWE8tek5zZVlOVDk4XzBmLTNBRy1mekI3T2gzOGlKQjBfZmdSU0Y1NDdwNmllNVN5eWZqT0FJcHpDUWVXeEpQN0lLcnV2RmxhYUdpTUE9PQ==

"Consider starting by volunteering at your local hospital radio station, as they are frequently in need of volunteers.

Although it is unfortunate that your local community radio station is not currently accepting volunteers, it typically serves as an excellent starting point. Community radio stations often provide opportunities to network with professionals from the BBC and ILR, which could potentially lead to opportunities with the BBC.

Many towns now have community radio stations, and there are also small independent radio stations as well as internet-only radio stations that may be looking for volunteers. Explore neighboring towns to identify any stations where you could offer your services.

While hospital radio can be a valuable starting point, gaining experience at your local radio station could be even more beneficial.

- Find your voice and what you’re for. Stations want presenters with unique voices, passion or purpose. Don’t imitate what’s already out there or try to be anyone else.
- High-quality personal projects (podcasts, blogs, videos) are as valuable as professional experience. Create great content, connect with an audience and build a following. Don’t wait for permission.
- Volunteer radio is helpful as long as it helps you develop an authentic voice. Focus on creating standout content that shows who you are and what you bring the table.
- Make connections by starting small. Depending on your interests, get in touch with specific local programmes and pitch an idea. Give them something easy on a plate that adds to their show and also showcases your personality.
- It’s tough and it takes time. Take rejection and unanswered e-mails on the chin. Presenting is a tough gig - opportunities are rare and competitive. Broadcasting is exhilarating, but you’ll be challenged every step of the way. Prioritise defining and explaining your uniqueness before knocking on doors.
