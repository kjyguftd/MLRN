"This what you should consider if you are from Germany. 

In my country a BSc. In biology will not be generally enough to enter a career in research or research environment.
The reason is that you have higher education then lab technicians but less skill and too low education and too low skill for science.
A BSc. Is a Fundament for many things but not qualifying enough.

If you don't want or can't go back to university you can go for other fields, nature conservation, ngo, environmental management in nature, urban spaces and agriculture for administrative tasks, which works well in my country (germany) and with a bsc. It's also very well payd (3800-4200 before tax a month) good working conditions flexible hours. Not too much pressure, with good job security and many offers for further qualifications. Public service.

In science with a bsc you can enter research communication, and lower assistance jobs. Jo will lose in any job interview against lab technicians, at least your degree will grant you 3300-3600 a month. 

So how do you get into the lab? 
Short answer: luck. 
Take every field, but watch for the methods! 
You want to do neuroscience? 
Cell culture, immunology, virology, Molekularbiologie, pcr, crispr, clonation, mikrobiological methods, animal experiments schooling, protein analysis. 

The moment you have 1-2 years of experience you have proven you in terms of technology and methodology. That's the skills you are missing. 

Then enter chemical analytics. If possible. 
Understand methods and mashines, especially their problems and how to solve and avoid them. 
Now you can enter every field, working towards lab management. Get licenses for chemicals deputy, animal health and first aid and risk management. 

Now you can apply for lab manager.

"Short answer: we don‚Äôt know

For funsies/layman talk we can say we‚Äôre half white or mixed or asian or hispanic etc. but realistically speaking none of it pinpoints the genes that we possess. In other words, we don‚Äôt have an african gene or an european gene, these are all social constructs. What we do have are a mulitude of genes working in tandem to give the appearance for those distinct groups of people. The genes within this gene pool will consequently yield the same phenotypic characteristics (like eye shape and color, interocular distance, nose shape and size, hair color, skin color and other facial features) because people will marry similar genetics and give rise to children with the same set of characteristics. When a person with one set of genes makes babies with a person from a different group of people (containing a relatively more different set of genes), the two sets will consequently be a mix of both *even though some of the characteristics may already be the same* and overlap.

Going into a bit more detail, there are a few ways genes can take effect:

- Pleiotropic traits are when traits of different seemingly unrelated systems in the body are affected by one gene

- Polygenic traits are singular traits (e.g. eye color height, etc) that are affected by multiple genes

So in summary, it‚Äôs really hard to say when multiple genes can affect one‚Äôs eye color‚Ä¶",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeGhUZWN2N04yS28zT0t5eUFvelliZEo1Zk9RSFFaWVlRN2pWbWNKZWE4SDYxeEdrMG9QWVk3RGtkVkZURkJjck44aUFKZDFQX3lIQmsyaWVZYzVKSXc9PQ==

"*Any* trait is one or mutations, I think you mean to say recessive gene. A mutation is just referring to the change in the genome that introduced the trait.   A recessive gene can be passed down through *many* generations without being expressed, it‚Äôs only when someone creates offspring with another individual that carries the recessive gene that the gene becomes expressive. 

Both must carry the gene at least recessively. Someone who is not a carrier that has a child with a red head will not have any children with red hair, but the children will all carry the gene recessively.

"No, it's a reasonable question. There are a lot of genetic diseases, including cancer, and it's a technique capable of gene editing.

However, it's just one of those ""we wish it were that simple"" situations.  The reasons why it's so difficult to apply to therapeutic uses are very technical/varied, and the reasons why cancer would be particularly difficult multiply those reasons by an order of magnitude.

"There isn't a single fruit or vegetable in the store that humans haven't genetically modified/bred to taste better and grow unnaturally. Whether it's flour in a bag or a grape, the agricultural revolution is only about 12,000 years old. There hasn't been enough time for significant evolution to occur in humans or plants during this period. Before the agricultural revolution, we ate very little plant food‚Äî2-30% at most, according to tests on human remains‚Äîand that was primarily to stave off starvation. Almost none of this was fruit since it ripens only for a short period each year. We are no more evolved to eat fruit than we are to snort cocaine; it's just a hijacking of a biological system. We evolved to eat cooked meat, mostly from ruminant animals, and nothing else. The only reason we stopped is that most of our prey animals went extinct 12,000 to 15,000 years ago.

As a side note, fruit isn't particularly beneficial. The nutrients in fruit are often in forms that humans are not evolved to absorb efficiently. It's similar to how lactose intolerance is misunderstood. It's not that lactose-intolerant people have a genetic malfunction; rather, some cultures have been drinking milk and eating cheese for so long‚ÄîEuropeans mostly‚Äîthat they have partly adapted to it. Some experts would call this evolution, some wouldn't since it's so short a timeframe, but the vast majority of humans are lactose intolerant because that's our normal state.

The same goes for fruit. Most humans can absorb some of the nutrients they contain, probably a vestigial ability from millions of years ago when we were still herbivores. However, for some vitamins, some of us lack the ability to convert them at all and must get those vitamins from meat, where they are in the right form for our bodies to use.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNmRFb2FfTzJuS0wxeEZOWW5SNlA4ajNtTFk2N29udGJyRXRxbGtNaHNiSXhaRTlwbFZ5UHhTQ3NBcTI3THVGSk1hOW5sZlJsOVdXeWJLQ0lhOU05N2c9PQ==

"I also find it difficult to advice since I don‚Äôt fully understand the scope of your involvement (I am not in a related discipline).  So as a general advice, if you feel that your contribution merits co-authorship, I would recommend that you email the PI and, in a very polite and friendly way, say that you were surprised when you found the paper because you were under the impression that your work would merit co-authorship. I am not sure it helps for this particular paper, but I think it would make you feel better and it would be an important mark of integrity for the future.

Second, when you are involved in research projects lead by others, raise the discussion of co-authorship very early, preferably before you have done any work. This gives you leverage in the discussion and then once a manuscript is being drafted, there is no discussion on whether your name should be included.

"Your question can be interpreted in (at least) two ways: (1) How can a virus be ""known"" if it is totally novel, without apparent predecessors? or (2) How can it be determined whether a virus was synthesized in a lab vs. in the wild.

It might make more sense to just explain who ""synthetic viruses"" are constructed. They're not constructed with a nucleic acid synthesizer (although they might be involved), instead they're made using portions of existing viral genomes as ""modules"" to create a unique virus. However, some portions (e.g., a specific antigen binding site) might be modified, as needed. The two sources linked illustrate how this is done.

"yes and no, your body has its own ways of regulating sleep (circadian rhythm and whatnot), disturbing it will throw it out of balance which can affect your health long-term.

there's also other indirect factors like light levels in the room when you sleep affecting the quality of your sleep, what you do while staying up late (screentime, snacking, no socialising etc) and how that affects your life when you're awake like not being well rested, not going out in the sun etc.

circadian rhythms vary a lot from person to person, some people might start feeling sleeping very early in the night and wake up naturally early in the morning, some others are the opposite. some people may physically need 7 hours of sleep a day, some might need 9. the importance is having a stable sleep schedule, sleeping and waking up at roughly the same times every day is important

imo, if you're feeling fine with you sleeping patterns, you wake up well rested, don't have many unhealthy habits and look after your health, there's nothing to be too worried about, i mean, obsessing over these things is also unhealthy. so, yeah, just see what works for you and do it",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTzFTb0hlbGhXbjc2TmdWdWhqeW1FdGQ3dXVIOC1iZENrdGs5TmQ3S19DYkpYR0lFQWFXXy1UX1NMajFxY3FWTjhqNDQtUjhJRTN1UTNVNEVDT0lKejMyaVgzMHl4Z2sybWl3Wm5ET05YbkE9

"Sorry it‚Äôs not idiotic, if one of those things is missing then nothing else works, so it can‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs not idiotic, all of those things must be in play at the same time for it to work, it‚Äôs very simple really, don‚Äôt over complicate it.

All I have to say is, you must have more faith than me, it‚Äôs a lot easier to believe in a creator than to not believe in one.

Regardless, you‚Äôre entitled to your beliefs, for me it seems more logical that we are created.

Look, I believe in science, just because I have faith does not make me a person who‚Äôs against science, as long as the sciences sound, I love science actually, it absolutely fascinates me, but personally, I don‚Äôt see rock solid proof yet, there are still very many things that are still very much a theory, some of them becoming less and less proven.

My problem is these days is they still teach things that are theory as if they are fact, and that is not real science, real science keeps studying things until they can prove it to be a fact , if it‚Äôs a theory, keep calling it a theory, and until you can prove it beyond the shadow of doubt, don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs proven, because that‚Äôs not truth, when you don‚Äôt have proof and you‚Äôre teaching that then you‚Äôre purposely misleading people, and that goes against everything science teaches.

For me, God and science can coexist, as a matter of fact, I think they intertwine, God is not against science, because if a creator exist, then that means he created science as well and gave us the brain to do science.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOTJDVHZ6VmhHWWdyRVZtQ0Q5clppWnJ3NXFVN0JsSUdtdmZZY19DYlFqUGRhX2g4M1ZQdXVxVzl4YWtXXzhPOWxPcHR2Zkg2ZEZKcVF0cldETlJ1dFE9PQ==

"First, how do you know abiogenesis only occurred once? Second, abiogenesis is not 'spontaneous'. It takes a very gradual movement of all the right ingredients at the right time and place for self assembling molecules to form and become capable of reproduction. These molecules would have basal forms that gradually become more complex until they're even capable of reproduction and metabolism. A lot more complex events likely need to happen before we even have something recognizable as life.

Also the question ""If abiogenesis happened once why hasn't it happen again"" is extremely loaded. It insinuates that abiogenesis has no empirical basis because there's no concrete observations of the phenomena, only ""speculation"". Even though most of that ' speculation ' is informed and concurrent with tested experiments and geological records.

"> Again, I can prove it's happened once. I exist, and so do you and we can trace all known life back to one singular event.¬†

That's not evidence that abiogenesis happened only once. If abiogenesis is physically possible, how is it then not possible for those physical conditions to exist elsewhere on an early Earth? There could have been many such events, many unique lineages of proto life that emerged, that could have been outcompeted by the singular event that gave rise to current life. We don't know because it happened so early in Earth's history that the information is lost overtime.

"The relationship between sexual activity and various health outcomes is complex and not fully understood. Here are some points based on existing research:

# Prostate Cancer

**Possibly, but evidence is mixed.**

* Some studies suggest that frequent ejaculation might be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. A study published in the journal *European Urology* found that men who ejaculated more frequently (21 times or more per month) had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared to those who ejaculated less frequently \\[[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0302283815014080)\\].
* However, other studies have found no significant association between ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer risk \\[[source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mens-health/ejaculation_frequency_and_prostate_cancer)\\].

# Cardiovascular Disease

**No clear evidence.**

* There is limited direct evidence linking the frequency of sexual activity to cardiovascular disease risk. Regular sexual activity might be part of a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity, stress reduction, and social bonding, all of which are beneficial for cardiovascular health \\[[source]()\\].

# Erectile Dysfunction (ED)

**Possibly.**

* Regular sexual activity may help maintain erectile function. A study in the *American Journal of Medicine* suggested that men who engage in regular sexual activity might have a lower risk of developing ED \\[[source]()\\].

# Weaker Immune System

**No clear evidence.**

* There is no strong evidence to suggest that a lack of sexual activity weakens the immune system. Sexual activity can boost immune function by reducing stress and improving sleep, but it is not the sole determinant of immune health \\[[source]()\\].

# Insomnia

**No clear evidence.**

* Sexual activity, particularly orgasm, can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality due to the release of hormones such as oxytocin and prolactin. However, there is no strong evidence to suggest that lack of sexual activity directly causes insomnia \\[[source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079215000716)\\].

# Anxiety and Stress

**Possibly.**

* Sexual activity can reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins and promoting physical and emotional intimacy. Lack of sexual activity might contribute to higher stress levels, but it is not the only factor involved in anxiety and stress \\[[source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2333)\\].

Overall, while some studies suggest potential health benefits associated with regular sexual activity, it is important to consider that sexual activity is just one aspect of overall health. Other lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet, sleep, and social connections also play crucial roles in health outcomes.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUF9mUDBpSEYzS0NmYnZ6UXVYbTlnLWpWS0xUYTc2dUwzakoyWWZvc0RrdG9TbGY2UVktUXpzanFVNFQtMzFCNkFYNVhpR0ZtQlllYkRFS1dYTUVBNUE9PQ==

"I've also heard the theory that the early organisms were highly unstable so constantly engaged in horizontal gene transfer. Basically the idea of ""species"" didn't exist yet, so there could have been many, continuous events of abiogenesis and they all just mixed out to one apparent common ancestor by the time things became more stable.

There's also the interesting question of why all of the life we've observed (and certainly all of the big, visible life) uses only a small subset of organic chemicals like DNA and RNA when there are many others, some of which are even easier to form than the ones that are used.

"One argument which has yet to be mentioned is chemical; The earth, as of 2.3 billion years ago (long before any fossils or other reliable trace material aside from genetic could form), is not conducive to any form of life vulnerable to chemical attack. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element that actively attacks and degrades carbon-based molecules. This probably killed most then-alive organisms on the planet, including a large portion of the cyanobacteria that produced the oxygen in the first place.

We, as humans, have a wide array of proteins and enzymes that exist for the sole purpose of keeping oxygen from killing us by disrupting cell membranes or damaging DNA. And we still suffer serious toxicity if we breathe in too much oxygen in medical settings. When fat goes rancid or iron rusts that happens because our atmosphere and water contains a large amount of elemental oxygen. It's something that is so corrosive it *shouldn't* exist in our atmosphere, without photosynthesizing life it would all be turned into CO2 or minerals over relatively short geological timeframes.

"From my own experience, and research, going to bed early and waking up early seriously helps you gain and maintain balance in your body. Our species went a lot in front of evolution. We share a lot of mechanisms with our ancestors, who went to sleep with sunset and got up with sunrise. Today, this is simply impossible because of school, work, etc. But sun exposure is connected in such a crucial way with your pineal gland! Nerve fibers carry information from your retina (part of the eye) to the pineal gland which releases melatonin (you probably know what it is, the ""sleep hormone"") which helps you get asleep as soon as there's no sunlight anymore. That's why some people say it's the third eye. The mechanism is still there, but it's completely fucked because of the way we live. And why is this important? The pineal gland has a role in regulation of all your hormones via the hypothalamus and the hypophysis. Scrolling social media, blue light exposure, bright lights in the room, eating before bed etc. all harm you, but besides that if you establish a routine that consists of going to bed a couple of hrs after sunset (for example 9/10pm) and waking up with or couple of hrs after sunrise (5-6am) you're basically regulating a mechanism that serves you well!

"Oh yeah, I was oversimplifying, good catch. I should've hedged my words more than just to say that the 'typical' / 'free' diffusion process, i.e. Brownian motion, ""explains how many molecules [i.e. not all, or even most] arrive from the initial location of synthesis to its site of biological function"". Brownian motion is often too simplistic in a complex cellular environment, especially an eukaryotic cell, and people have observed proteins that diffuse in highly heterogeneous patterns; diffusion may of course be limited by the presence of barriers or molecular interactions, or due to directed motion (or both). However, to be clear, Brownian motion models are sometimes the best fits for the observed diffusion pattern of a protein. Molecules can move in a Brownian or non-Brownian fashion (e.g. anomalous diffusion). And personally, I think *in vitro* studies have put more emphasis on the former while *in vivo* studies emphasize the latter and highlight the need to consider other interactions. The abundance of other cellular molecules *in vivo* introduce many competing specific and non-specific interactions that can affect substantially the physical behavior and biological function of a protein of interest.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYjVlUjZ5a19MNkxJOWxocUR4a3VXb2hXcGpmYTU4ZElDRVJPZ0ZtODI0WUhpeXBCTjB2d29hR2JsVzJXaUdEWjJDdmNhVVF1c19fSlFyYWppTVdSenc9PQ==

Though it depends on how you define abiogenesis, it was more like a process, so saying that it happened once is like saying dinosaurs only happened once, they did, because we have defined it that way.

Playing devils advocate here but do you think it could be possible that a new form of proto-life spawned that was either inorganic or composed of materials that were poisonous to most life on earth? It would thus be 'inedible' or repulsive to the majority of current organisms.

"I recently got glasses for myopia at age 30 (probably needed them for 10 years, grew up using computers constantly) and as much as I hate to admit it, what my parents would say about how you would get square eyes from sitting too close to the TV actually had a grain of truth to it. 

When I looked into it, the general concept behind myopia comes from a few factors. Close range vision is difficult for your eyes to achieve and takes a bit of work/strain, and your eyes usually stop growing around age 20 ish. Combine these together, and when you're constantly using close range vision it constantly promotes excessive work or strain in your eyes, which causes them to continue growing past when they would normally stop into the oval shaped eyes common in myopia. 

The physical shape of the cornea is what focuses light on the retina. In a spherical eye this would work with no issues, but due to the oval shape of the myopic eye the light isn't focused properly. It has nothing to do with your eyes being ""too weak"" like some people say, and interestingly it seems like quite the opposite - you used your eyes so much and they grew too big for their own good. This is why laser surgery works, because it literally shaves off the oval shaped part of the cornea and makes it more spherical, letting it focus light correctly again.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOEdLVmVrd2NNRE9VdEV0cWkwOXpkTWlIVEVKWVlXSHJvOS1RbGdaOEZhOFJUQzRsSDJtd0JjelpRQjdldm9qQ2tfUUdMQk56MHh1UEozNXRpenZTMnc9PQ==

"> I can claim it happened once, i cannot claim it happened twice.

 The fact that current life exists and appears to share one common ancestor says nothing about the abiogenesis event itself, other than it did happen at least once. If it happened at least once, then it is physically possible. Therefore it is probable that it could physically happen again, under the right circumstances. 

Do I think it could have happened more than once? Yes, I think it is statistically more likely for that to be the case. The same with life existing elsewhere in the universe. Do I have evidence to say it happened more than once? No. I never claimed that I did, nor that I know for certain that it did, I only ever acknowledged that it is possible and likely. Could I claim it didn't happen more than once? No, because there is not enough data to know. 

You are the only one in this thread making definitive claims.

"A theory that has lots of attention is ribozime theory, where first molecules where RNA-protein complexes, able to hold genetic information and replicate them, and then DNA appeared. In my mind, there were regions on the planet where the conditions necessary for this kind of molecule to create were optimal and trillions of these proto first biological entities were created. On top of that, it's possible that other kind of abiogenesis pathways were almost impossible to happen, so this was the ""only"" path for life to occur.

"Nothing to do with biology, but...

Sort of both. I'm British but have lived in the US for the last 23 years.

If I couldn't have afforded medical insurance I would have been screwed.

Just after I moved here, my wife put me on her medical insurance. Then I got sick and was hospitalized. When the bills for our co-pay (that bit we are responsible for paying, not covered by the insurance) arrived, I told her she should have put me on a plane, gotten me to Heathrow and then I could have called an ambulance. Flying backwards and forwards would have been a lot cheaper.

Now I am a bit older, I am eligiable for Medicare but still have to have insurance, I went with Part G (Medigap), rather than the more heavily advertised Part C (Advantage) plan.

Yes you need insulin. Because you need sugar to get into your cells.

"No, because another issue is that glucose is not getting into the cells to drive ATP production. In your given scenario, the extreme ketosis will still lead to ketoacidosis.

Glucose must enter the cells, hence the need for insulin. Theoretically, perhaps you can eliminate all glucose and just use fructose, which enters cells through an insulin independent pathway. However, the inherent lack of control of fructose uptake, and the fact that excess will still be stored as glycogen means that it's not perfect.

Insulin is also a cog in general energy balance, so I would be hesitant to even consider eliminating insulin supplementation.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac202QUlPUHZaMmJnbjhNeDlSR3RHRkx1cVJHQzRVN0oyN2k4Wl9uMzNQZmRma0V5aE1NNmVlVVQ1Ym1aZjJtRGRpNXUtZ2YzOGtCZHJOcnlZOEFRYWc9PQ==

"The body evolved to use insulin to regulate getting sugar into certain cells, so yes, you need it. Blood sugar being too high is just a symptom of the true issue, that your insulin signaling pathway isn‚Äôt working properly for some reason. Remove all the sugar from your blood, fine, and you won‚Äôt have hyperglycemia, but you still have diabetes. Your cells still need to import glucose.

Neither type of diabetes is a simple, black-and-white problem that boils down to a low or high amount of sugar present it your blood, it‚Äôs that one of your body‚Äôs main strategies for controlling the movement of sugar has become deranged.

"There doesn't need to be an evolutionary reason for being slow. 

1. Being slow is sufficient to eat and survive long enough and reproduce. 

2. Being faster doesn't benefit them. 

  
Of course, we could hypothesise that if snails were faster, like the speed of mice, they would survive better by being able to avoid predation better. But how are snails going to \\*become\\* as fast as mice? That's not the kind of evolutionary change that happens in one generation and the incremental speed changes that can slowly result in large changes over millions of years provide absolutely no better chances at surviving and reproducing because their prey is all \\*SO\\* much faster than them. Thus, nature does not select for faster snails.

"It's also worth noting that evolution is absolutely littered with local optimum states that can't easily adapt to a new niche.

Maybe a snail could evolve such a circulatory system one day, but the niches that would require it are all occupied by birds and mammals that are already better adapted.

"In general terms, it means an ecological ""role"" defined by an organism's environment. Qualities that can define a niche for a species include the food it eats and where it tends to find it, the times it is most active, and the predators it is good at avoiding.

More specifically, niches are what organisms compete for survival over; when we speak of ""survival of the fittest"" what we mean is ""survival of the organism that is best at occupying a specific niche"". The reason the concept is important in evolutionary studies is because typically, two species cannot share the same niche in the same region for very long. The one who is better suited for that particular niche will usually outcompete the other, which must either adapt to occupy a different niche or go extinct.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRVVVTG1CeDB3X0Z2bnBQdEpPTk14djZXRDJwZzZvLXBya3RoeThCTnVzTm5qRG5qNFVENkVUMzlwZG4wOENINVpBZ2c2Uk1UNzhHYXRPd1dIeWVIU1E9PQ==

"Okay but no one is claiming that evolutionary change happens like "" Scrabble letters falling onto a table"". Evolution, even what you refer to as macroevolution happens gradually by little tweaks. If the little tweaks benefit the organism they are more likely to be passed on to Future Generations.
¬† Look at the human eye for example. If I claimed that there was an evolutionary jump from light sensitive cells on the top of a flatworms head to a complex eye with a retina, vitreous, lens, aqueous, cornea, and muscles to move it around, then you could compare it to winning a lottery with impossibly long odds, or dropping Scrabble letters on a table and coming up with Hamlet. However there are examples throughout the animal kingdom of progressively more complex eyes. Evolution is a gradual process and nothing happens with a flash and a bang. It has been my observation that most people who believe in intelligent design or young Earth creationism really don't understand the science of evolution and all of the evidence for it.

"Generally normal in mammals, especially larger ones. Like other mammals though, it is not necessarily healthy for large mammals (like humans) to have children within the first years of sexual maturity. That being said, evolutionary pressures tend to prefer a species starts having offspring as soon as possible.

In terms of human specific traits, women also tend to mature mentally and psychologically much faster than men. A study done by Mark Hanson and Peter Gluckman from the University of Southampton suggests **it was likely the age at which women could function as mature members of an early prehistoric and paleolithic society**, as hunter-gatherers, without an unnecessary risk of death due to pregnancy complications, for the time. Males however needed more time to mature physically before they could contribute to their roles in an early homo sapient tribe, and so also developed psychologically at a slower pace as well. Long-term societal pressures as a species, essentially.

As society became more complex, the period in which humans considered ourselves psychologically developed enough to function as mature members of the tribe changed. Obviously, our biological functions could not match our rate of psychological, cultural, and societal development. So we're left in the awkward predicament where both men and women, but especially women, reach sexual maturity far before they should.

As an interesting note: Chimpanzees have a relatively similar gap in their ages of sexual maturity between male and female members of the species.

"Human pregnancy is incredibly dangerous. Due to humans standing upright and our heads being so big, a woman has to pass an already very premature baby through an incredibly narrow pelvis. This is incredibly risky and painful.

A girl in her late teenage years is even more at risk for complications than a woman in her twenties, I assume that's why girls used to start menstruating later in their teen years than they do now, around 16-18. Quite a few very unnatural things happened in humanity very recently, one of them being access to very large amounts of high energy food causing lots of childhood obesity and thus early menses, another being medical intervention allowing a young girl to survive a birth and pregnancy she normally wouldn't have for her age.

This actually goes against natural evolutionary fitness. Early pregnancy would kill a young girls body that's undeveloped, and yes a girls body can be undeveloped enough to handle pregnancy and still menstruate thanks to unbalanced hormones. A 5 year old can menstruate if specific hormones are present.

That's a new thing I learned. So I probably like my food as it is because my ancestors used to eat it. But if I talk a little personal, it's not the case with me, i usually avoid sweet food and sour foods while my other family members can eat literal buckets full of them. I think I just don't like sugar and sour taste.

">‚ÄúExtremely rare for someone to find a widely considered delicious food repulsive and vice versa‚Äù

I mean, you‚Äôll have to define ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù, but I think texture/flavor issues are pretty common, and there are plenty of widely despised foods that are loved in specific cultures. I personally know at least 5 people who despise bananas, multiple people who hate onions and garlic, and I personally gag over mayo. Individual preferences like these are evolutionarily adaptive because they promote sharing and cooperation (I‚Äôll trade my extra banana for your extra fish). 

On the other hand, there are foods like natto or haggis (sorry to pile on) that the vast majority of people from outside their respective cultural contexts will quite literally gag trying to eat. 

Food preference is also a deeply culturally-mediated phenomenon (explains disparate views on spicy food), and ultimately many foods are an acquired taste. Something like natto will be disgusting to the uninitiated because, as a fermented product, it has a lot of features associated with rot. But those who are culturally in-the-know have learned that a specific type of rotting (because all ferments are really just controlled rotting) that preserves a product and creates a unique flavor with unique nutritional properties.

There are certain tastes/properties of food that are widely enjoyed (sweet, salty, and fatty), which can be attributed to their contribution to the basic human diet. On the other hand, bitter, sour, acrid (spicy) or funky foods are statistically more likely to be dangerous, though there are plenty of exceptions for all of the above. So those tastes are more often accquired through socialization rather than being base human cravings.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS2dBcmpaUURTU0pqTmU3UDE1WG5TR2lZWHRDa2xIMGZFdTJqZjFuTFJHTGhxazVMQVRzOEd1NFJGLWo1cW9kckhjWFBRbTRNc2lDdHNZTGNMRExXYUE9PQ==

"Because secondary sexual characteristics show later in men than women usually. Usually emotional maturity and facial ""ruggedness"" etc etc doesn't kick in until muscle levels is fairly well developed. This is evolutionary, believed to be because men can often kill who they view as rivals/competitors (i.e. what they perceive as other men) but far less likely to kill a child. This means men who have more time to build their muscle bulk etc before they look like full men are more likely to survive to adulthood (as they are more likely to survive/win fights, and more strength puts people off from fighting in the first place) , therefore more likely to have children who survive.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMS1ObUF2RC1FcjA5YXJzYWNJWERxMnBrNUszZWo5dEg2MlNFbjdBNjVEMDhUUHZqeDU5dW9iamNMOXhrenRVTVBWT1NkcHpQODZwbHYzcW9Sb2RZS3c9PQ==

"Reproductive maturity occuring faster in female, at least in humans, seems to be tied to the fact that the wierd way oogenesis occurs makes it extremely disadvantageous to wait too long since meiosis in female occurs in almost a suspended state until they ovulate which completes meiosis. Compared to in msles where they just make a new batch of sperm every day. That lets the egg suspended in the middle of meiosis accumulate damage that can mess with oogenesis and result in a faulty egg. Thats why the age of the mother is a bigger factor in congenital diseases than the age of the father.

Now why this wierd paused meiosis occurs in eggs but not sperm, I dont know, but I suspect it has to do with eggs having the mitochondria and cytoplasm and sperm not having it.

Another good reason is that female are inherently the one who invests more in reproduction because the egg contains the cytoplasm with mitochondria, and it scales upward to pregnancy, which is safer and more succesdful the younger the female in mammals. reproductively the age of the father does not matter as much as age of the mother because a dad is not as critical as a mom. An old father can still impregnate a woman and lead to a successful pregnancy. An old lady may fail in health and completely terminate the pregnancy.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS0N5TTU1VFlGVkY3UEtfd0pEOG94UlhDemhPcG5pQzNIT3pVUFpZY2ZyVUU4NTY5U3JHYXhLWWx5MUxxSi1oRUE0cDFuTGJ3NWxNWGp1Q3IyYi1GZlE9PQ==

"Unlikely. There are markers on the maternal & paternal DNA that correspond with each other, missing a whole set on one side shouldn't work.

A more extreme example is a complete molar pregnancy, where the egg has zero chromosomes, and the sperm has 23 but still divides, so the resulting ""baby"" has a seemingly normal number of chromosomes, but of only paternal DNA. A baby never forms, but the trophoblastic cells continue dividing into a vascular tumor.

A partial molar pregnancy is a little different as you get chromosomes from an egg & 2 sperm, so 69 chromosomes. A baby can form, alongside the trophoblastic tumor, but it is not viable and has severe genetic issues obv. The tumor also ends up taking up too much space in the womb, restricting the fetus.

"Probably not. Micronutrients are important, but calories are overwhelmingly more important.  

Things like an elevated risk for prostate cancer due to zinc deficiency in childhood/early adolescence are (1) hard to study due to a lack of high-quality evidence for nutrient levels in kids, and (2) are often large in terms of effect size, but small in absolute impact. 

According to the CDC, there are currently about 116.5 new cases of prostate cancer out of every 100,000 people with prostates in the US. Suppose the risk ratio for early-adolescence zinc deficiency was 1.5 ‚Äî which is pretty big, and would mean something on the order of 100,000 more new cases of prostate cancer per year in the US.* That‚Äôs a big deal on a population level, and something we‚Äôd want to address from a public-health standpoint. 

But in terms of individual behavior, your chances would go from 0.11% to 0.17%. By comparison, the chance of injuries from traffic accidents is around 0.5% ‚Äî meaning it would have been almost 10 times more dangerous to teach you to drive than to withhold (maybe) sufficient zinc. 

(* I have no idea what an actual estimate would be, here, since I can‚Äôt find any studies I think are generalizable. But I suspect the effect is substantially smaller than a risk ratio of 1.5.)",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWTRrM1djaHloSWE3ZlpwRDBtMTJaRVlIMGdTNDBLMUwzM2w0b0M1dGZBQ2VCeS1WNTVSRW52Y3lTSXdobTl0X2lmVnVXN21STGU5cEtNWmVaSDNEbXN2TGlSLVZsYW5NYzRfa1FpMVFrejg9

Take a look at one of the online microscopy resources on how to read an objective. I like Nikon‚Äôs MicroscopyU: https://www.microscopyu.com/microscopy-basics/introduction-to-microscope-objectives

The numerical aperture can tell you what the immersion media is, if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt say on the objective itself. Anything with a NA less than 1 is an air objective.

"No one seems to have actually answered the question. Some are even denying that puberty occurs earlier in females than in males, which is deeply concerning given this is a science subreddit.

Yes, females begin puberty at around 10.5 years and males at around 12 years. The start of puberty for both males and females is similar, the production of gonadal steroids, namely testosterone being metabolized into estradiol which stimulates gonadal maturation in both sexes. For this process, the body requires body fat, which females tend to accumulate more of than males. With body fat being more readily available to females, gonadal maturation can begin earlier and progress more quickly. This is also why it's common to see females much taller than their male peers in the early teenage years. Following the onset of gonadal maturation, the process diverges substantially in males and females, but still tends to progress slower in males.

Nutritional availability has also allowed for earlier onset of puberty compared to centuries past. It can also be difficult to assess exactly when puberty onset happened because the first physiological signs of puberty are apparent only sometime later.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVzA2XzVGeW94Y1BvWkZqeWU4cFh2ZE40NWVVaUwyVFdUTWI4eG1MUk85REI4c2Q2Yi1aZzgzZGtVMnBtVkxIVkhSYVRhRUNTaDZ0S3JPazQ2aHU5ME5qSThnU2oyLW9hODZpaXh5UkR5ZjA9

* Start a run with one plant and one grazing animal species; wait 30-50 days for the populations to stabilize; then, add another animal that eats the first animal, and try to predict what will happen to the plant and grazer populations

* Try to use what you've observed to create a stable food web with as many species coexisting stably as possible (If I remember right, one of my student groups managed to get to eight out of nine possible species.)

Couple quirks of the program to keep in mind: the population numbers are a bit meaningless; you can compare a species' numbers to itself, but there doesn't seem to be any meaningful correspondence between one species' numbers and another's. There is no variation in abiotic conditions, and hence no plant niches; one plant species strictly outcompetes the other two if not balanced by predation. The animal icons are purely cosmetic; you can fully customize what each species is supposed to eat, but if you give two species at the same trophic level the same dietary settings, the simulation only seems to run one of them and ignore the other.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhQzBkZTZZR0NMTFRWV0ZrOVZ0Ykc1MzEyUGVtZlVTOWQ1U3ZCYTJNa2lEaVE0ZG5vcXIzQkZjcXlWempzb0ZTNUFCS09GYTVTcmtHdXBFYVJoZE9aNmc9PQ==

Another is Hypogonadism which is the under development of the testicles, which cause problems later in life.

"At least according to this video ([Why Dawkins is wrong | Denis Noble interview (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCLRKP9NW8I)) his point is actually not that his claims are revolutionary - he even said Darwin knew about what he is claiming to be the case. 

His claim is that a genetics only model that reduces organisms to genes (or to phenotypes that are an expression of genetics) is too simplistic and leads us down the wrong track. As or more important is the ""clever"" utilisation of genes, not as coding for how to make a cell / body but as part of the whole toolbox that cells /bodies use to do what they need to do. 

Specifically he is addressing types like Dawkins who see an organism as an ensemble of genes first and foremost.

"Okay. First, your grandfather is stupid if he says that. You are 14. It's normal that you don't have a job yet and it's normal that you won't have a job for at least the next 4 years. 

Next, universities in Germany don't focus on past jobs in a bachelors or masters program. They focus mainly on your grades. There aren't any jobs anyways that you can pursue at 14 to polish your resume, so go for the best grades possible. Biology can be studied in Germany in the Bachelors with any GPA, but this is highly dependent on the university and most undergrads are in German. So I would advise you to make your undergrad in wherever you are right now and then pursue your Master's degree in Germany, if you are still interested in it. The GPA for a good Masters degree should be around 2.8-2.5.

Next, how do I know this? I am a marine biologist in Stralsund, Germany, where I work on cetacean behaviour. I have studied in Germany and lived here my whole life. I didn't work in any academic job during my bachelors and only started doing stuff like that during my Masters degree. 

Good universities to look out for in Germany if you want to pursue a degree in Marine Biology, are

- The School of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, they have an institute called the institute for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. And they do work on cetaceans and pinnipeds there as well. I studied there, but originally went into primatology during my Masters and got into Marine Biology afterwards.

- The University of Kiel
- The University of Bremen
- The University of Hamburg
- The University of Rostock (If you want to work with marine mammals, maybe the zoology master would be better here. My collegues tell me that it's a lot of fun as well)
- The University of Greifswald

"There would be an infinitesimally small chance of a normal baby provided the missing chromosome and extra chromosome are the same. AND THEN division in meiosis would have to split them favorably. 

It is similar to a person with Down syndrome having children with a person with the normal number of chromosomes. Some of the sex cells would have 23 chromosomes, some would have 22. About half the offspring in that cross would be normal, about half would have Downs. 

Missing a complete set of chromosomes does not produce a viable offspring.",r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhWGhBd09PLVVNWjM4bGlGSDAxZmg2X05MQlZleVF2Q3I3T0ptUjFCRkNYMTlpVFo3bmJoSkdfRzFMenBVdEo2d3ZnbnNQUVFYSDYxZnlvZ1I2UXQwMkE9PQ==

The only survivable combination I can think of is if the egg has an extra chromosome 21 (Results in Down syndrome) and the sperm is messing the sex chromosome (Results in Turner syndrome). The resulting Down-Turner baby is just a typical baby with all the signs of both Down and Turner syndromes combined. There only exists six cases of this condition around the world. I think that any other combination would be fatal. (Maybe if the egg have an extra X and the sperm is messing an X a normal human female could be born but that need extra research).,r/biology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhLW9YdlFHODBWSks5RU9tMUZwYUxZWktCTktCMktnaWE1U0pJa0JhS1ZBX2VON3V2bk5UeXpyYnZjTFVpeTlnUHhsbFpNLUdfLTd1aEFHN082ZGRfSXc9PQ==

Girls' fates were probably better in matriarchal societies, but where these were, I even don't remember, and the horrible FGM on girls is enforced by older women, not men. And it need not being ancient: the other day I read a travel blog of a Russian man who spent some time with a tribe in Laos, and they marry girls off at an early age, and I don't know how it is physically possible, but they have children early and are done with this when in our society this only starts nowadays, but the young mothers don't have to raise children - it is done by older family members.

"You can get pretty close, though true immortality is ruled out by the laws of physics.

We can ignore the ‚Äúinability to die‚Äù aspect, and only look at the ‚Äúliving for an infinite duration‚Äù part.

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in a given system has to increase of remain constant. Unless one can eliminate all losses to the environment (perfect efficiency, no heat radiation, perfect matter conservation, no gravitational waves, etc.) then the system has to approach thermal equilibrium‚Ä¶ or heat death.

Other things I smell about +/- normal...if there is a dead rat, a fire somewhere, I am detecting it maybe a little bit less than my wife. But women are said to be a bit more sensitive. So I think more less in the normal range.

The moon has no atmosphere, so you have nothing protecting you from radiation or asteroids. So any colony would have to be underground. That means you‚Äôd have to take a lot of heavy machinery to be able to dig out space to build in. 

Low gravity means your bones and muscles would deteriorate should you be there long enough. That essentially prevents you from returning to Earth. Same goes for mars.
