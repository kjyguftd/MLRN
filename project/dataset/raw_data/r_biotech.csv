"Hi, first of all I really have to say, thank you so much for such a detailed answer, I truly appreciate it and I know it must have cost you a considerable amount of time!

Initially, I was searching for btech biotech colleges for the same reason, that the pay will be better and I know a lot of universities in the NCR offer it to students who didn't have maths in high school. 

The reason I voted against it was 1. I will have to work harder for maths and while I can manage that, I don't think only managing will suffice. I will have to be good at it for better positions, at least that's what I had in mind. 2. The fees I can afford (barely) but it is a lot and i wasn't sure if I'd get a worthy return on that investment (placement records weren't that great, and honestly I have no idea if that improves as career progresses). 

So eventually I proceeded to Pharma vs bsc MSc (and yesterday I had just decided to go with my instinct and pursue Bsc but then you replied, it's for the best! No complaints obviously, but I'm again in a dilemma).

Will I really face such a huge cut in jobs with an MSc degree? What if I pursue MBA after it (while working somewhere) and will Pharma with MBA yield better jobs? (Also what colleges for b pharm m pharm do you suggest? Just curious because all I knew were pvt and i wasn't so enthusiastic about that but a degree is a degree). 

Thank you so much for the recommendations to enhance my portfolio, btw! The only boost I was aware with was of publishing a research paper, so everything else is a great help. 

Oh and yes, I don't want to work in labs OR continue in research field but that's only because I want to finance and look after my family. Research won't be the way to go about that. 

Everything else you mentioned, I'm on it, reading in detail. Please respond if you can for the above mentioned queries. :')",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYRm9fRzRhczc0T0prVmlGQzdvZmNZQk9fWGFMVE9ZeXcxcjlCcjdUTkFFa2s2X0pFMWx6aFlHcm9ZV0M0VW84M3gxdU5CYmtlMHpzOUtyTFZ5Y3UtTkE9PQ==

"The only way to progress in Biotech/Pharma/Life Sciences is to do an MS outside India. But, you need work exp now more than ever, because international sponsorships are hard to come by. First BSc, then work experience for 2 years, and then MSc.

Employability after a BSc may will take a hit, in the sense, that so many domains won't be open to you. A starting package for BSc is generally 3.5 lakhs, and even for B.Tech unless it's more a math/compsci filed such as Bioinfo where you can bag a 5/7 )lakh p a package at an entry-level. So, pay cheques may not be that divergent.

You can do an MBA. That has nothing to do much with knowledge gained in  Biotech/Pharma/Life Sciences. Specialised health care MBAs in India don't make much of a difference. MBA outside India needs 3-5 yrs of work experience from a good company, constant promotions, leadership positions and so on. 

You can get into research later on. Outside India, to move up the ladder in sciency  roles you generally need a PhD, and there are many industry PhDs as well. 

If you are hell-bent on research, after undergrad, try bagging a role as an RA in European university. Of course that will only happen if you have done some research internship at that uni before during summer or something. 

It will be hard to continue loving science in India, because it doesn't pay. And you need Math for any and every field today. You don't have to be that great at it.

Also, learn Advanced Excel, SQL, Tableau , SPSS/STATA during your last year. Will be needed on most jobs.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYS3dfS1Uyc3V0MzlnVk1DM1VCNWRsaFdxZVJSQ3N6djZGMU5wYW1XVXppZ1ZxYjNaMzhBQndnZVZHUkpOMzNHWDdCUUN2bmRTNXFmXzAwU0RFMHd4ZXJEWi1TX3EtOE5CWmVJMUNHdm15Tlk9

"One of my fav subjects was Organic Chem. I really wish I studied Biochem and Med Chem. Perhaps, as an MS. Though, it's a bit of a saturated field in the US. And in India, there are more generic drugs being produced. If you LOVE what you study,it won't be that hard. But, you also have to be pragmatic about it. 

Also, whichever of the 5 paths you take after Life Sciences, choose wisely. You can't switch between one cluster to another. You will have to start again at an entry-level pay. Unless you do an MS. Which is why work exp before MS is super important 

A great way to earn money after undergrad is Scientific Comms on the side. Pick one subject that you are a Master at. Epidemiology, or whatever you are taught. Find people on Linkedin in that niche. Find them on Nature Science/ Science AAS blogs. Read their blogs or Newsletters. Email them that you would like to contribute. It could be something like data visualisation, interesting info graphics and so on. There are great Data Visualisation courses on Coursera. Often these people will be profs. Find a reddit/discord community to be in touch with research scholars. You can even contact Profs on Coursera actually, whose courses you take, that's the easiest way.

You could also earn money through Scientific Illustration. It's like drawing comics but for biochemical processes and stuff. Do the same thing as above. Many people need some illustrations for their paper. Others may need for publishing a Science novel. Find top Science Writers/Illustrators from Scientific American, Pop Science, NYT Science and so on. Look at their work. Build a portfolio online. Great way to keep you in touch with Sciency stuff and your work. Actually, many ed-techs like Byjus (Just don't ever apply there) will need your help. Build a great portfolio first. Learn animation after drawing. 

Don't make these your main jobs. Because often people with PhDs switch to Science journalism and illustration. Earn money on the side through this. Often people who have spent almost a decade or two grinding themselves, learning about tech, and have a lot of exposure move to switch fields later in their life, when they are looking for something creative and relaxed.

"Welcome to the industry! The most important thing to know about an entry level role is that you’re not expected to know everything. Show a willingness to learn, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to acknowledge that you don’t understand how something works or that you need help.

I’m assuming this a GMP manufacturing role and if that’s the case, take data integrity, training, and documentation very seriously. Your signature is your word that you checked or performed a task. If you see or suspect something is off, say something. I’d rather have a non-issue be raised than an actual issue be overlooked. 

Take the time to build connections in the different departments. It’ll not only give you insight into other roles that you might want to explore as your career progresses, but I also like to have some “go-tos” for quick questions and such.

"I love organic chem! It is one of the reasons for my inclination towards biochem! I understand about maths, not choosing it in 11th grade is still one of my biggest regrets. 

And yes, MS outside India I'm super aware, didn't know about work experience, however. If I go through BSc or Pharma, I'll need to have work experience and various other skills for my portfolio, right, got that. 

So entry level salaries for BSc and Btech are in the similar range, but I'm assuming BTech offers better range as career progresses, as per your initial input that an engineering degree makes better. Does that stand true despite the college I do it from?

MBA, yes, I wasn't particularly talking about health care MBAs but rather a general MBA, actually. 

Research I'm not that excited about actually. I know pay and research don't go hand in hand so :') industry PhDs, I haven't looked into or thought about as much but I will keep this information with me for the years to come. 

That's so true, loving science in India part. That's a relief to hear I don't need to be great at maths, hah!

Excel and SQL I actually did want to learn for the same reason! I even looked into programming languages courses (mostly python) and data science on Coursera. Data visualisation I'm hearing for the first time. I haven't started anything yet but I'm glad to know they will help. Other skills you mentioned, I will look into them too. Can't harm having more things on your portfolio, anyway.

Should I search for the HRs now? Talk to them, I mean. Sorry I'm confused whether you suggested that as a course of action for now or in the final year of bachelor's. 

Can't switch courses, got that too. After undergrad ventures also, got it. Saving these. 

Earning money through illustration sounds really good because I love to draw and wanted to learn animation for a while, this is a great push for me, honestly. But yes these are side hustles. 

I'll try my best to surf through these sites and get in touch with more and more people. And that last line is a hell lot of motivation, not gonna lie. 

Just this one thing, everything you suggested about building connections after undergrad, building portfolio during undergrad, all the skills and people and platforms, I'm so very grateful for that and it is such a big help. 

However, forgive me but my dilemma prevails, Pharmacy vs Btech vs Bsc. I just want to ask that these things you mentioned, they'll help me with either of the ones I take, right? So exactly how do you choose, I mean don't get me wrong, I'm not asking you to make the decision for me but out of all the people I've talked to, you know a lot or at least have helped me way more, and after learning so much, now I just want to make a choice (i honestly don't think my brain can handle more confusion). 

Bsc will cut down jobs even if I learn programming languages, SQL, Excel and other things? Securing an MS outside India via scholarship is obviously a hectic job and a chance event more or less (depends on my merit too) but does that make me more qualified for jobs? (As qualified as BTech)

And does Pharma follow the same trajectory as for BSc? Or does it allow me to have better options than it? Ultimately, what is the better shot, given that I take it seriously and accompany my degree with the mentioned skills, get familiar with different networks, people, etc.?

And, oh my god, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH HONESTLY. ALL CAPS BECAUSE I'M THAT GRATEFUL TO YOU, SERIOUSLY.

"1. Back in 2017, when I applied, DU Biochem needed Math in 11 and 12. So, it made sense for me to do Engineering. Because I did have Math. This means Math will be taught in BSc. 

2. Whether you go for BSc, B Pharma or B. Tech, you will need work experience to improve your chances of employability after an MS outside India. Undergrad then Work Exp then MS Outside. Why would they hire entry-level workers, that too, International students? The world order has changed since COVID. Most entry-level jobs are being automated with AI or being outsourced to cheaper countries, like India, China and Phillipines. Also, once you have two years of work-ex, you are out of the early career range. You enter assoc roles.

3. Europe scholarships are plenty.  Education in Germany is dirt cheap. Even if you have the option to go now, go. In any case, know a language. It adds a point to getting a  job visa. Even if it's not needed in the job. Also, if you work for 5 years in Europe, you can get a PR. Check Blue Card.

4. Actually, I will backtrack. I have no knowledge if BSc salaries are always same. In my domain, they were. But like, I said, there are 5-6 clusters and it's highly dependent on that. Employers have a bias for Engineers though. And Engineering will allow you to choose which cluster you enter. BSc generally doesn't. B Pharma also helps. Your college unless IIT, BITS, NIT won't help in negotiating pay. It's not that Google will pay 40 lakhs to IIT D but the same Google will pay 20 lakhs to DU CS grad. However, college matters a lot to shape your profile, opportunities and you Outlook. Engineering colleges often have consulting club, finance club, Tech club and so on. This allows you to have easy exposure to other jobs that align with Bio/Pharma and generally you can sit in their placements as well. BSc is generally in universities and not in Engineering colleges so I am not sure, what opportunities will be available. 

5. Data Viz is easy to learn. So is design and animation. Easy side Hustles.  Data Science is a must now. Learn it by second year. If you want to go into Biostats, you need to study Statistics, Predictive Modeling, Programming and a bit of AI/ML, though not necessary initially. If you want to go into Bioinfo, you will need Calculus, Linear Algebra, Genomics and so on. Data Science is broad. Anything from Stats to Calculus to AI/ML.  R, SPSS and STATA are used in Biostats. You can know one. R, Linux/unix are needed in Bioinfo. Start with R over others. Excel and SQL and Tableu/PowerBi will be needed in anything and everything. 

6. Talk to HRs now. Actually, look at HR Directors, rather than just HRs.

7. Those sites will help in undergrad. Not now.

8. I don't have sufficient knowledge of BSc or BPharma. Even though, I work in Pharma, but I don't know what opportunities are available to BPharm and BSc since I studied at an engineering college and not a uni with B.PHARMA and BSc courses.

"Remember, this journey is not easy. Profs might tell you that you are medical rejects. And that there is no scope in this field. Classmates will cry about the payscale and compare it to tech and finance professionals. Most of them will end up preparing for GATE and JRF positions even though they aren't interested in research. You do you. If you build a side hustle as a freelancer in these sciency domains, you can earn enough in an international currency and will be away from the toxicity. Or you could do the same with Data Science

Remember, Data Sciencce is a language. You still need Bio and Pharma and Life Science knowledge to apply it.

"happened to me last week. Got an offer, half an hour after they spoke to the second reference. 

My advice, dont just give the reference names to the potential employer, give the context in which the references know you (so the employer can prepare better on what to ask) and if you can, explain the references quite thoroughly about the position (i.e prepare them to bat for you)

"I have used a career coach twice, for short periods due to the ongoing costs of coaching. Thoughts: 

* Coaches are of some but not great use for short term issues (e.g. I have this problem right now at work). It was still useful to discuss those things, to check my thinking, almost like a counselor. It was also useful to check job materials like by CV. 

* It's mostly useful for larger issues, like what you want to do, a strategy to craft the career you want, ideas on workplace behaviour, etc. More abstract, more long term.

"I've been on the big pharma side of diligence, and you'd be disappointed to see how often ""move fast and break stuff"" start up attitudes accept things like missing controls (obvious controls, not ""did you think about this"" kind of stuff), a treatment-related noisy molecular result that goes unchallenged/unexplained, underpowered data, or lack of convergent validation for a foundational result.

I was in a similar situation to you.

I am so glad I didn’t do that in hindsight. I ended up leaving for a short stint in academia working for a friends lab. While this was an expensive move from a salary perspective it enabled me to be a lot more thoughtful in my next career step and to get involved in some fun science projects with some good people. I ended up landing a great job that I otherwise may not have had the patience and energy for because I had moved to an envirnement that allowed me to put in the required time and energy.

"There are two completely different worlds and this require a different approach to science. Big pharma can take time to really polish up their therapeutics because, take I/O as an example, someone will ID a new target and then the company will throw a plethora of modalities at it. With the intention of bringing ALL of them to PhI and letting the clinical readout decide the winner. There is some time pressure, but the company is likely to get a winner out of it. Scientist grow in this environment feeling quite close to how things happened during their academic trainings. Of course my description is not a perfect fit for all pharma companies.

Startups are a different species. You get one tech, one bag of cash and one, maybe two, shots at goal. You have aggressive timelines (cuz your cash is running out), lots of competition, limited resources, so you have to make G-NG decisions with limited info, most of the time. Scientists learn to be nimble, focused and to not follow the scientific method, but rather get enough info in x amount of time to make decision forward.

I’ve worked in both. I have big pharma’s red tape, bit I did it earlier in my career (SS and PS). I love the speed and maneuverability of startups, plus only there you truly wear multiple hats. 

In the end, good seasoned scientists will understand the environment they are in and will adapt.

"In my experience, people like this are excellent in R&D roles that focus on getting things done quickly but not necessarily doing it in the best way possible. Lots of taking shortcuts and cutting corners in order to prove a concept quickly. They're very good at these things and that can be of tremendous value. I've seen them be much more independent and able to take the ball and run with it, though sometimes this is a negative in the sense that they're used to being completely autonomous and don't play nicely with others or deal well with managerial oversight.

It's painting with a broad brush, but I typically don't see these types of people being very successful or very happy in the slower-paced realm of dotting the i's and crossing the t's that comes with bringing fully vetted and tested products to market, dealing with regulatory affairs and quality assurance teams, etc.

"You generally need a MSc first to do a PhD in Europe. In the Netherlands at least there is a common exception, as you sometimes see BSc technicians who’ve worked with a PI for a very long time (5+ years?) being offered PhD positions. 

The biggest factor in spinning off from a PhD project, I’d say, is luck. Grants for PhD projects aren’t written with a commercial incentive, since grant money mostly comes from tax payers or charities. So you need to be very lucky that you discover something fit for valorisation during a rather fundamental research project. Building the startup is something you do outside PhD project hours as well. On a volunteer basis basically, even after securing your first funding rounds, since you will want to sink almost all that money in building the business initially. 

The above goes for spinning off a company with a biological product (diagnostics, therapeutics, etc.). I read that you are into computational biology and AI. So you could consider building a SaaS. In that case, a PhD or even an MSc is not required at all if your SaaS is not aimed at life sciences.

Go to work, learn as many transferable skills as possible, gain experience, and you're in the best situation you can be if you get laid off.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRzg0X2RfUUlJZFJuNV92X1FPVkxaVlZTMXBxZFZnaTN5YWhEbDJQcklrdmliaUF3d0dnTFFPLThyUzUzNWM5dVJ0YV9vNHNLZjlNY2wtcEhMbG9tcm41ajNJWk9wcy1HcjQxOU1zVWE1NDg9

I'm experiencing my second layoff in 5 years. This time is super annoying because I was super involved and interested in what I was doing. But apparently they don't care.

"I was laid off in April for the first time, and it was a massive hit to my confidence. I didn't realize how close to burnout I was from the stresses of my job, and it really came crashing on to me.

That'll finish up at the end of this year, so now I'm just trying to find a way to make ends meet as the severance dries up - it's a rough market out there, especially coming from solely startups, where I don't have 10 years of experience but was a director.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT0xGZHNjWEQ4U2FoUlhuVzVfYkZULUxKMUVfalJBanpDaFFRVUVvM2RIZWxZQVpIR1ZaNjkycW4tWl9ORW5KUnk2cHBramliSUJ3RnhDSXFYZUI5c1E9PQ==
"I’ll parrot every thing here and add a bit more.

"I have been laid off multiple times, and I’m currently staring down the barrel of probably a third time soon. 


I experienced them early in my career, so it’s influenced how I approach job hunting. I always ask how the runway looks at job interviews. I ask how good the CEO is at raising money. I look for signs of belt tightening and vague reasons for that happening. I especially look at behavior when clinical trials enter the picture. 


Most importantly, I acknowledge I’m in a much better place than most of the US in that I’m well compensated, and therefore I have an excessive emergency fund explicitly to deal with the insecurity - one that lets me survive with minimal woes for quite a while. But I am also single, mostly healthy, have reasonable housing costs, functionally not debt, and no kids. I can make huge sacrifices that others who don’t have those life conditions can’t. 


So basically - live well within your means, create an emergency fund that can last you longer than you think you need, constantly be learning and pushing your skill set in your career, and be kind and helpful to coworkers so when layoffs happen you have a network who knows you positively.

Another idea would be to target CRO medical/safety positions. Similar work, and a stepping stone to sponsor side.

"I'm shifting from LabOps, so it's a bit of an easier transition than from commercial ops. I'm currently in a MLA certification program that isn't too difficult course-wise (though we're just getting started), I'm at a local community college and the course will get me a phlebotomy and MLA cert. Because I already have a biology-based degree (biomed engineering), from what I can find, I'll be able to sit for the MLT (technologist) exam right after I get the MLA, then it's a year of clinical work (if my previous human cell culture work doesn't count) to get my MLS. At MLT, I've seen quite a few clinical lab ops roles that I fit the description minus the certification, so I'm hopeful it'll open up some roles for me. 
It's a bit of a roundabout way to get into medical lab work, but I'm hoping it'll offer a bit more stability than biotech LabOps. I'm lucky to have the flexibility to go back to school, though I'll have to find something in the meantime even if it is outside of industry to pay the bills.

"The US is definitely higher churn and offers fewer protections, but the cutting certainly happens in the EU as well. It's also a highly cyclical industry, so you tend to be unemployed when everyone else is, so the length of searches are longer. 

The one nice thing about being laid off is severance. If you're ""good"" (have a skillset that lets you find another job quickly) you can switch to the next thing quickly and pocket the severance (and maybe add a hiring bonus on top of that). Last time I was laid off it took three months to find a job but I took in about $120K in severance and unemployment.

"It often depends on the company. Most of the big companies have some sort of severance for layoffs and then there is a state based unemployment that typically lasts 6 months. 

Different states also have something called the ""WARN notice"" which applies when the layoffs impact more than a certain number of people or are a site closing. What's nice about warn notices is you at least get 2 to 3 months (depending on the state) of notice before it happens so you can start looking while employed.

"Greetings!

I wish I could provide a meaningful advice.  

I am somewhat of a contrarian. Based solely on my own life experience, I find most of the advice either useless or totally wrong.  For example, during my postdoc I very quickly realized that I was wasting time. The PI tried to lie to all of us, talking about publications in ""Nature"" or ""Science"". No one believed him! All postdocs understood that it would take somewhere between 5 to 7 years to even have a try to get to ""Nature"".  

What mistake did I make? Well, I am a former life scientist. So, naturally, I hoped (expected) to find a job in biotech / pharma / government lab. Plus, I listened to questionable advice from ""Cheeky Scientist"" etc.  All waste of time! About 7 years ago I was sending applications all across Canada, from B.C. to Ontario and PEI. I am sure that I sent over a hundred applications. Only to get a job of a project manager in a no-name place. From what I hear these days, a hundred is a minimum.

Essentially, I should have tossed aside my lab skills.  I should have learned how to code. Back then computer programming was picking up steam and there was a real chance to switch careers, because the barrier to entry was reasonable.  Now the situation is vastly different. The entry barrier is higher, there way more people competing for fewer entry-level jobs, salaries are not that great etc.  What was a reasonable opportunity to change careers, it does not exist anymore. 

Another BS advice, in my opinion, is to customize your application (resume/cover letter). Have you noticed that no one talks about what exactly is meant by this ""customization"". How significant should it be? Imagine, you are sending two job applications per day. You spend minimum 30 min to customize your resume / cover letter. Is my time estimate realistic? Probably not. You have to find a job posting on LinkedIn, read it couple of times, see if it fits even remotely, probably google the company etc. Start re-writing your resume / cover letter. Submit them in response to the job opening. For me it will definitely take more than 30 min per job posting.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNGdaQTl1Y05pQkN3Tko1VDJVZzJrU3NqSEJYMlZoWUx4d2FGLUFjZzl3cGZxQ2l4RXQ2TzRCYlJ6UzI2N2lUVGd5Q1o0eWpPZ2tRSGRQdU02ckhneHlwVGVJalY3NDlBNmlzSDZkWjhIa289

"I disagree with not getting too attached to colleagues. I think I know what you’re trying to say but networking is important.

"Something I have learned is that you have to drive your own growth and internal promotion. It’s not going to be handed to you just for getting the work done.  Years of experience is one thing, but working on the right deliverables and making a business driven case for why promotion is deserved is another. 

Is there a clear framework for job ladders and promotion at your company? If so, I would consider mapping out the projects/deliverables you have completed matches what is required for promotion. Then use that to have a discussion with your manager. If there is something missing, it could also be an opportunity to work smarter, not harder and plan what the rest of 2024 could look like for you. 

The best time to find a new job is while you have one. The market is rough right now, so it could take 6 months - 1 Yr to find the right next fit. In the meantime, you have nothing to lose by trying to grow at your current company unless it’s a highly toxic workplace.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYUt5M1k0S0pBcHFrNEswdEdWOVQ2OThlYVR5N0dCNEE5TnhGZzE3TDZZZlJKLXB1NXFZdEZMeDZURDI4SG45Z0VUMEVIeEVhRU5PdkpiR3FKNEY2TWc9PQ==

"Laid off fall of ‘23, I hustled and had 3 offers by mid-December. Pocketed the 4 extra months severance as well as 2 months unemployment.

So it turned out great, but the truth is it really sucked. There was no warning from the company, no indication cuts were coming, and it really shook my confidence and sense of self worth. Nondescript meeting from my manager at 10, and at 10:30 my computer was inaccessible. People NEED to understand that that is how it works. Plan accordingly. I did not, and it made things harder.

I can only speak for the US. What folks must understand is that pay is much better than Europe, but safeguards are generally less generous. The way to make this work is to pay yourself as if you worked in Europe for the first year or two in order to save up a very good emergency fund. At least 6 months. 

My wife has a stable (but lower-paying) job and I have two kids near college-age. Once we cut out retirement investing, 529 savings, the cleaning ladies, and a few other relatively painless changes, it was clear we could go for a very long time before we had to dig into the emergency fund, let alone rainy day fund or retirement savings. If it’s possible, this is the position you want to be in. It would not have been possible for us earlier in my career. There were times within about the first 10 yrs out of grad school that a layoff would have been very challenging. And forgoing retirement/college savings for many months (or years) certainly would not be ideal.

I have no parting words of wisdom that will make everything ok. My new company may get bought this year, and since I’m relatively new this would not be much of a payday. So I may be right back in the ring. Or I may become a stay at home husband. Or switch careers. I don’t know.

BUT. I do know this. I will not give away my physical or mental well-being to any company, no matter how much they pressure me to ‘perform’. I’m pushing 50 now, and I’ll tell you, if you don’t take care of yourself (and I mean dealing with stress, especially), it will come back to bite you in the ass at a time of life that you’d still like to be feeling healthy.

"Also keep in mind that because the job market right now is trash, hiring is a “buyer’s market,” meaning we get a ton of qualified applicants for every position we post. I guarantee you that several experienced immune-oncologists applied to this role, and they still chose to interview you!

"Most biopharma HR will regard you as having no industry experience. It's also a real bad time to break into the area, so be patient - in your place, I'd expect to throw out a couple hundred apps before getting traction (YMMV, of course). I'd suggest name-dropping the industry partners for projects you worked on. If you're mainly applying to discovery jobs, consider assay development and/or bioanalytical jobs, as your resume looks a little more oriented to those kinds of jobs. Be creative where you apply (outside hubs, non big pharma, target start-ups, etc). I'd also flip your skills and job experience sections. Understand that the first person seeing your resume will be an HR person who has no idea what any of your skills mean. The hiring manager will, but you have to get by HR first. Get good at explaining what you do to a nonspecialist in simple terms, then get more technical when you pass the initial interview.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaT0ZqbzdCRVdxbTBDNlE5VW5VMXdxYkl1cUVsTXgwbHVvSzlvX0ZxWHhfNFpGMnhBQ3hjU3ZvQ0o3N2duRG5qZHVyUk5WN0VxSzUyRzVlTzREWEJRckE9PQ==
"As someone who took a similar route, the question is twofold: what do you enjoy doing/are good at doing and what is impactful/valuable not just to the company but to keep you relevant and growing.

There are so many career paths, and I would network across and outside your company to find out what those entail. Some may not be open to you based on your degree or your company, so that can direct you to either obtaining that degree or look elsewhere eventually.

At the moment, it sounds like you like doing more of what you already are doing, so the immediate question is whether you want to deepen your expertise or apply it to more leadership and management roles. Personally, I went with the latter: there are definitely some areas where I'm an acknowledged expert, but I found more fulfillment in using that to influence decisions and strategy as well as coach and mentor others.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNE4wTEFnY2NGQ3ZMQ0IxQ1ZoWE41UkFTSU5hbWZPeHhWSUFxOFpkdnh5ZVZ3bzRsdzEyUzNtYUV0ZmU3RF9JYU4zSklGTXZXLWUxR3hveUF6ODlkMFE9PQ==

"Biochem faculty here. 

I'm guessing from this question OP has no chemistry research or internship experience. It will be very hard to break into pharma without this, even at the entry level. Tracking hundreds of graduates over the last decade, those with strong research experience had almost double the chance of landing a science job within 12 months of graduation (i.e. >75%+ vs < 40%) .  This is at a large public university in NE US (Non-prestigious but R1).

OP is already graduated, meaning they cannot apply to REUs or internships either. In such a scenario, I would highly recommend considering a chemistry masters with thesis at the nearest research intensive state school as a way to get hands on lab experience into your resume (MS are rarely funded so in-state tuition if you are in the US will be the best bang for the buck).

It doesn't have to be a fancy school, but it DOES a need to be research intensive so you can join a research lab, do a proper thesis, and hopefully get hands on experience with every type of analytical equipment that industry uses. Our MS students have a 100% success rate getting pharma/bio manufacturing jobs by time they graduate, as we happen to be located near several manufacturing hubs and other regional schools are either not research intensive or do not offer thesis MS degrees. They have the virtue of putting you at the top of the list for BS+experience jobs (MS counts as ""experience"") while not over qualifying you for entry level positions as can often be the case for PhDs...

"It's a recycled buzzword, bioprinting has been a facet of industry since 2007. CellInk and Organovo, to name just two companies, were selling 3d printed tissues as a pharmacological service back in 2010. It's a very high resolution method for bulk screening compounds in med chem since it can be a better predictor of patient stratification when a small molecule hits the clinic. But regenerative medicine? Yea, no way. For skin grafts or for like transplanting simple structures like knee replacements, maybe. But complex organs, no. That's a pipe dream. Scaffolding technology has come a long way, but getting the geometry right when layering tissue is a big problem. Even the most advanced printers can only move a bio ink nozzle on the x and y plane. Nobody can do Z plane and still get the structure to last longer than 24 hours before it collapses.

I used to work in this space. For 3 years, we tried to bioprint a section of large intestine or colon that could eventually make it into patients with IBD. We aren't even close to there yet, maybe in 30 years. Besides the structural challenges, the crosstalk within native tissue is a culmination of a lifetime of methylations upon methylations and a specific progression of gene expression. It takes time. Cytokines in precise quantities in precise local areas at precise times. And that's not even to Crack open the can of worms that is GVHD, even when using autologous primary cells. There's no scalability. There's no way to make a functional business out of this tech right now. 

It's just a way to generate hype the same way the term AI has been bandied about the last couple of years as the harbinger of the new generation of personalized medicine.

"Great advice! Here are some concise tips for entry-level scientists preparing for interviews:

1. **Show Problem-Solving Skills**: Discuss how you designed and iterated on your experiments, not just the results.
2. **Clarify Contributions**: Clearly state your role in research projects and what was done by others. This helps eliminate guesswork for the interviewers.
3. **Presentation Timing**: For PhD candidates, aim for a 45-50 minute presentation to leave time for questions and transitions.
4. **Take Advice**: Listen to advice from your host or anyone who recommended you—they know what the interviewers are looking for.
5. **Stay Calm**: Relax and be yourself. If you’re invited onsite, the team wants to see you succeed.

For extra practice, consider using Verve AI for mock interviews and real-time feedback.

Good luck—you’ve got this!

"I think the way to generate value is to either 1) develop the technology, whether that be the structural component I.E. the bio ink or the scaffolding or the printer itself or 2) find a novel use for the simplified version of bioprinting that is actually achievable. 

From a CRO standpoint, where companies that sell bespoke biorpinting as a service have failed is in the pricepoint. Back in the early days of this technology, big pharma would have to pay six figures to get a 24-well plate of transwells that had pseudo liver tissue printed on them. That's only enough material to test at most 24 compounds. The price point was set due to the insanely high cost of scaling up the technology. Primary cell isolation, cost of developing suitable materials like bio ink and structural components, the immense cost of developing the printers themselves. And then all of the cash burned in not only proving the consistency of the product but also that surrogate pseudo tissue matches the clinically accpeted biomarkers of real patient studies.

I think the real payout would have to be in the advancement of the bioprinters themselves. If someone could figure out a tangible way to improve the functionality of printer nozzles in a way that advances the geometry that we can commercially print, that would be a huge, huge leap forward. And it wouldn't come close to advancing this tech for an application in regenerative medicine. Yet it would alter the bioprinting landscape as we know it.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR0VUWm1TZnQwOXo3QXpxVGQxWkFPRFBVa3JUVXBfUktodVNWYmFFR3QxaXZDcTBfQlllNFljSURBbXRqd3h4SkZTY0RCNHBQeTV2QlMweWozZjJBMVE9PQ==

"I would look for the promotion on the outside. If merited, you should be able to find it. Resign and in your resignation state that you felt it was unlikely to receive a similar promotion in your current situation. You were happy with your current situation otherwise. Thank them. 

They may counter. That seems to be the modus operandi for more and more companies. Last two companies I was at, the only way to get promoted was to get an outside offer. Ditto, if you wanted anything more than a 2 to 4% raise. Last company, we had two QA types leave for mfg roles at company A. Company a went down in about 2 yrs, without ever producing a single commercial batch. They were promoted at Company B. Company B site was closed after 30 months, without producing a single commercial batch. They went to Company C for 20 months, without producing a single commercial batch.

With this sterling record, we brought one gay back as the head of MFG, and he pulled his minions with him. The Sr  guy replaced all but 2 manager, Sr manager, Assoc Dir and Dir with his guys. I and a gentleman in another area survived for a couple of years. Then we transfered out. Replaced approx. 13 positions.

With the full team in place, the Department scorecard fell out of the green for the first time in over 5 years. The Department finished the year with their worst average weekly production in 6 years. 

What was the reward for this sterling record? Promoted the Sr. guy to VP, and several of his guys git a step up. 

Moral of the story? Get recruited in and you to can fail up. 

To the OP, the Sr. guy left a IC, non-management role in QA. Failed to produce anything over 5 plus years in the wild. Returned as a Sr. DIR. He was promoted to VP in less than 3 years, after presiding over the worst year of productivity in the previous 6.

"Thanks for your opinion, I truly appreciate it! I am also wondering about the experience depth that HM look into. 

In the past 6 years, I work in two drug development programs. One has been licensed out to pharma and one is currently in LO phase. Being in the small groups (one project lead + 3 biologists including me), we need to hands on most of experiments in various stages. I divide my time in this 6 years as follows:

1- 30%: biochemical assay development and execution (enzymatic assay, TR-FRET, AlphaLisa)

2- 10%: biophysics assays: protein production and purification (four proteins in total), SPR affinity and kinetics measurement (one protein bind to small inhibitors)

3- 30%: cell-based assay development and execution (pathway inhibition, proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis, protein-protein interaction, competitor differentiation)

4- 20%: translational research (combinational treatment, generate resistant cellular models and investigate the resistant mechanism) 

5- 10%: in vivo studies (PK/PD assessment and efficacy studies)

I would say that I have the least experience in biophysics assays. Would you suggest that if I apply for cell biology position, do I remove ""protein purification, SPR, etc"" from the sections of key skills and professional experience in my CV, which makes it more specific?

"I'm sure some schools are like that, but our MS students often do coops or internships, complete a real thesis (often on an applied project initiated by an outside employer, who can sit on the students committee) and they end up making more than us professors within a few years.  We can't find a single MS grad who didn't get a better and more highly paid job than our BS grads. Whereas the no-experience chem grads often end up at temp agencies like Eurofins hoping to eventually go client-side, which rarely happens, and their experiences have uniformly not been good.

"Your resume is very standard to other resumes I have read, so no red flags there. 


Your postdoc experience was for five years and only takes up 20% of a page while your research scientist experience is six years and takes up an entire page. I would shorten and delete some of your bullet points for the research scientist position. 


Most, if not all, US companies will not consider you at all since you are located in Canadian. It's like HR prevents them for interviewing people who are not already physically in the country. Furthermore, will you need visa sponsorship? If you are located in the US market, your best bet to landing a job is to move into a US academic lab first. 


It has been 13 years since you graduated from PhD, and you have only been in academia for these 13 years. It is actually slightly concerning (and I know because we talked about it extensively for a recent candidate). I also have a coworker who was in academia for almost a decade and was hired at the right place/pandemic time, but I can see the red flags that people always warn about when hiring someone with long term tenures in academia. I'll be honest - no matter how much your skillsets align with the position, I will not even interview you for a senior scientist position. For people with long tenures, you best bet to going into industry 1) was during the pandemic, 2) through a connection, or 3) is getting hire at a high position/director. 


This leads me to the important question - if you have so many industry collaborations, why not reach out to your industry peers for a job? My hiring manager peers in industry always try to hire their close/good/productive academic connections (to the point where it feels like they are spamming their connections with any and all open opportunities). ",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMGh0VVBieU9LeDZIOXItZEpzOExqc0NPTG84Q05ZMWN2WkFjYnlqSFZHX0tvTDBPSGFSNURteFYzc3BPUndRcjJHODliZXF6dVF0QW1GZ1ZfRW16NEE9PQ==

"To me, you have a good start but your key content is lost in just endless bullet points. Walls of text tend to be a bad start. Here's where I'd consider changes: 

1. A summary that highlights your experience and goals. This would replace your first 4 bullets. Something like ""Molecular Biology & Biochemistry PhD with 11 years' experience in oncology drug discovery and assay development. Published and patented research scientist with extensive laboratory knowledge and hands-on experience mentoring associates and research fellows."" ...pull out what you think are your key points in 1-2 sentences/fragments; try to clarify your goals here, too.
2. Skills: 
   * Your skills section is by no measure ""key skills"" given it takes up half a page. I'd pare it down to actual ""key"" skills and move the section to after your experience section, before education.
   * Systems and software could be their own section, and you don't need to write out the items in the MS suite. 
3. Bullet formatting: 
   * Typically, I've you want about 5 bullets max per role. You could repurpose your 4-bullet highlight section to add a couple more key accomplishments there from any roles or your research work. You can pull out others by adding a ""publications"" section. Then take a look at what is left and be critical about what is important to a hiring manager in deciding whether or not to talk to you.
   * Bullets shouldn't be longer than 2 lines. Streamline your language - both in being more concise and in not using more complicated words than necessary. (e.g., ""elucidate MoA"" ... really? elucidate?). Examples:
      * Consider whether words like ""a"" or ""the"" can be removed. (e.g., ""Explore the resistance mechanism of pre-clinical candidates using the acquired..."" = Explore pre-clinical candidate resistance mechanisms using acquired...)
      * If you write out a term and then abbreviate, you don't write it out after that. (e.g., MoA)
      * Consider rephrasing where you use ""of"" - removal, rewording, or using a possessive (e.g., ""evaluating of drug combination effects"" = evaluating drug combination effects; ""mechanisms of action of pre-clinical candidates"" = pre-clinical candidate's MoA or pre-clinical candidate MoA)
   * Don't let bullets span your page gap

"Question 1) when they ask you what your salary expectations are, don’t give a number. They have a number in mind. You don’t want to over or undersell yourself. Simply say “I will consider any reasonable offer.” If you get an offer, simple ask when they need an answer by. If you really want this job, don’t take the entirety of that time. You want to start your job off with them 
knowing you really want to be there. 

2) nobody is ever 100% perfect for the job. The best companies won’t choose candidates based on perceived knowledge, but whether you are pleasant to work with and willing to learn. You need to be okay with saying “I don’t know, where/who should I go to so I can learn?” If you are learning from a subordinate, take the attitude of “I’m interested in what you do and how you do it.” As in, you must understand the details of what they do so you can advocate to get the resources they need and help their professional growth. Understand where their struggles are- you won’t know that until you’re in the weeds of what they do.

"For a lab tech role I'd guess they'll be less interested in the research itself, and more in the process -- lab techniques and equipment used, documentation, challenges you encountered/overcame, improvements you made to the lab's ways of working.

Be sure to look into Good Laboratory Practices to get a sense of what working in a regulated lab is like and how the rules differ from the academic environment/ As your first industrial placement, they won't necessarily expect you to understand GLP deeply, but they'll want you to understand/appreciate that being a lab tech in pharma is very different than doing lab work for academic research.

A simple example is the treatment of out-of-trend or out-of-spec results; in academia, you might be able to get away with just tossing the result and running the equipment/sample again; in pharma, there is no erasing bad data, and you must formally investigate to determine if the result was valid, and if not, what caused the error.

"Most importantly, there are toxicity and shit everywhere no matter what country or field you are in. You have to learn out to get over it and not let affecting you. 

I’m not discouraging you but showing you a reality. You are 17 M. Assume 3-4 years of undergrad and then you will move to USA for 2 years of masters. You can’t predict job market of USA or any country after 5-6 years.

First thing to consider Education cost, visa application cost, living cost and Job based on International student status.If I assume you are from rich family background, still there is no guarantee that you will get student visa for masters. Let’s assume you got visa and completed study, it’s very difficult for immigrants to find a job without US experience who needs sponsorship from employer for H1B. Just ask any immigrants who came here for study and ask them honest opinion how hard it is, not social media filtered version. 

Let’s talk about India. I know there’s no value for degree as mostly everyone has masters degree and it’s highly competitive market. India is developing very rapidly and mostly companies are having their manufacturing and outsourcing services in India. There are chances after 6 years, there will be more opportunities in India than in USA. 

Biotech vs Medicine. It’s upto you in what field you are more interested. As an example, I can’t deal with surgeries and blood since anatomy practical. It’s “NO” for me even I get free education and million dollar salary. I just can’t do. Biotech/pharmacy is better choice for me. You definitely would have better idea what type of career you want.

"Very minor points below, I don't think any are why you aren't getting an interview but might as well improve

* Change fall/summer/spring etc to month
* No need to specify ""10 hours per week internship to determine effect...."" Just begin that point, ""Investigated the effect....""
* Between the two pharma industry roles I'd try to add least more pharma-specific work/terms; the jobs read as if they might as well have been in an academic lab. Something GMP/GLP/compliance related ya know. Did you maybe work on change controls, deviation investigations, implementing new tech, method development, anything like that? I really say that because there's little in this resume that would trigger industry-focused keyword-screeners
* Try to begin every bullet with a verb rather than a noun; reword ""extensive experience"" and ""experience"" with what you actually did to gain that experience. ""Used"" and ""studied"" and ""supported"" are pretty weak as well, again focus on what you actually did
* Change ""Presentation skills"" to ""Technical Presentations"" or something similar
* Summary grammar; should read ""contribute"" not ""contributing"". I'd also reword the 2nd sentence, I don't fully follow it. Are you saying you have skills in accelerating drug development? Or you want to use your skills to help accelerate drug development? Wording is a bit odd. If you are saying ""apply my drug development skills"" there should eventually be a ""to"" in order to say what you're applying them to.

"I had a similar situation a few years ago. Most of these talks focus on a past project and give details on what they did and the analysis/results. Since I could not present data or share specific project details from work at my past company, I formatted the presentation as an argument for why I was a good fit for the role. 

First slide gave an overview and structure to the talk. What topics will be covered and why I was covering them. (These are the things I did/can do which make me a great fit for the role). 

I started off with 2 slides giving a brief background of who I was (credentials/background etc) and what I like to do (ice breaker/ give the team insight to who you are as someone they will have to spend 8hrs a day with). 

Then I talked about the requirements of the role and highlighted the ones of most importance and I had direct experience with (2-3 main points). 

Talked about a past project/ situation that directly relates to one of the job requirements (without giving proprietary info) and what specifically I did for the project. Talked about the technical skills involved and a problem I overcame along with the result. 

Repeated the same for 2 other job requirements. 

Then I talked about what I can bring to the role and the department outside of what was already talked about.

"To add on to everyone's comments, you'll probably want to elaborate more on different aspects of your experience depending on what positions you're applying for. Industry is a lot more segmented and specialized than academia, and your resume makes you look like a jack of all trades/master of none. I'm sure you're work was more thorough and detailed than what you've listed here, so I would dive more into specific assays and techniques you've done to help get through some of the candidate screening filters. A protein purification role for example might want you to go more in depth about your cell AKTA work, so start listing things like different chromatography techniques you have experience in (affinity, IEX, RP, SEC, etc), projects you've led and troubleshot (if you can disclose), and important milestones (can be anything from papers/conference presentations to simply completing a specific project or goal).

When I'm visiting a customer it's either to train them on using our tech, help them with application development, or other support.

"A scientist seminar during an interview is telling your audience a couple of important things (in no particular order):

1. your presentation skills
2. your domain expertise and ability to talk about it cogently
3. your technique expertise, both as a reinforcement of what's on your resume and to assess the choices you make when designing approaches and interpreting raw data 
4. the way you think about a research project from end-to-end, including key context, identifying what's important, ensuring appropriate controls, and performing the right set of experiments to build a rigorous and interesting forward-moving story. The ""why"" of science rather than you just following someone else's directions without knowing what you're doing.

The outcome of the presentation portion should be that the listeners have the impression you know what you're doing and you have the right skills/aptitudes to be successful in the role being offered (some training is always expected).

There's no problem with presenting one project if you can accomplish all the goals above. If you have the skills but are limited by your confidentiality agreements, you may also be able to ask your hiring manager if you can partially present a journal club that is similar to some things you've worked on.

"It will differ depending on what area you'd like to get into. My biggest advice I give to most people trying to get into industry in any way is to get as much hands-on experience as possible in school. And the more niche tech you can get your fingers on, the better.

Some examples of technologies to consider would be: Microscopy (confocal, fluorescent, etc), NMR, Mass Spec/LC-MS, Flow Cytometry, FTIR, rtPCR, Next Gen Sequencing, etc etc. Getting that type of experience will make you stand out amongst the slew of new graduates that probably only have molecular biology or wet lab experience.

"I started 2 biotech companies. 

The first company was acquired by big biotech. That company was acquired by big pharma in the largest acquisition in history, at the time.

The big Bio company paid 400M for the startup. The start up was 8 yo

The big Pharma company paid 4.4B for the startup shares. This was 11 yrs after the big Bio acquisition

The first generation of bench scientist would have made  approximately 2.75M at the time of the big pharma acquisition if they retained their original stock grants. 

We brought in a CEO about 15 months in, his shares would be worth 29M if he retained all the shares. 

The second company was acquired after 2.5 years, everyone made some money. That was a complex, incentive milestone laden deal. We got all the milestones. But they were spread over 5 years. A bench scientist there picked up about 200K spread over the 5 years starting about a year after the acquisition.

I was the first, non-founder employee at a third start-up. I made zero on that one. That is the stock certificate was worthless. I laminated it as a reminder.  It is in a box somewhere. 

There you go. Real world results. 

If you can stand the uncertainty, intense pressure for productivity, and general craziness - then I would recommend the start-up. Especially if you are young. 

If uncertainty makes you break out in hives, go with the established company.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnM3VpM3FVekItVWI2SHVDSDNQTXBLZkJHMXowalZZM1V5bTdPelhUaGQwVXc1Q21QTGJiSmNILTZnLTQ5azFhYjRfSUlIMTB1RkFRY1RiYnBEUnR0bHc9PQ==

"If you haven't already, you should do some research to familiarize yourself with the current state of the industry and best practices for job applications in order to adjust your expectations and improve your CV (if possible). Looking at job hunt-oriented posts made in the last year on this subreddit alone reveals that 2 months is not so long to be looking, and people have repeatedly posted about having to send out double-digit and triple-digit numbers of job applications before getting a job. Because your PhD makes you highly trained and fairly specialized, a post-PhD job hunt is likely to be more challenging than any you've had before. It really helps to consciously remind yourself that this is a long and challenging undertaking so you don't become too depressed by the process.

If possible, try to get in touch with people in your department for advice and connections: friends who've graduated or who know people in industry, people who like their job and can say if their current company is hiring, former students from your lab who can recommend companies that are looking for skills like yours, and so on. They will also be better equipped to tell you what (if anything) you're doing wrong or if it's just the job market to blame.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnU2ljYjNDWnFpMkxIQm95M1AxbGMwOUh2dkRibHJzdUMyNEZnRVc2Rmp1MXpIRzkxN2o1MzM5bU9TTnRyUlg0cXBUczgyUlFJWTRmdDZsXzlsUXFGNDE0bmMwM1F6b2dtUHZEcGEyTlJjak09
"It's not as lucrative but does have the benefit of unlimited vacation.

In all seriousness if you'd prefer not to heed my advice by all means, go for it but you're just going to give yourself depression when you submit hundreds of applications and aren't even given the courtesy of a rejection letter.

I know people who have been unemployed 2 years in the Boston area, people with 25 years of industry experience, PhD, published in high impact journals, etc and they aren't getting a single call back.  I've applied to positions above, below, and at the same as my current title and no dice.  If there is that much talent here and they aren't given the time of day, what chance do you have as a fresh PhD?  Not saying that to be a dick, but rather to temper your expectations to be realistic.  Breaking into industry right now, in that metro, is difficult if not impossible right now.

No one in Boston is hiring and all are continuing to layoff, Takeda alone is on its 3rd if not 4th round of layoffs.  Most of the positions posted in Boston are ghost roles to help companies secure credit on their unemployment premiums to offset their intended or undertaken workforce reductions.

If Boston begins hiring again, it won't be until after the election because the comprehensive hiring freeze is all but tied to interest rates being too high to justify investing in pharma/biotech.

As I said, focus your efforts in other areas of the country.  Your mental health will thank you for it.",r/biotech,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnaDRiNW9Cd2tCcW5sWkltMFlkb0xFNXhicWpkTDFsSnAzMHRpVlhsM2lUeEtSeUplekg0MXE4S0NJem9NZUtSS2V4VWNBNEFHVGVSUHVFOTBiNS1tT0E9PQ==

"It can be hard to land a job in industry without a post-doc. I did it, but 1) I applied to 100s of jobs —basically like applying to jobs WAS my job, 2) found  mentors who gave me resumé feedback and taught me how to network,  3) did some volunteer work in exchange for networking and experience, and it may have helped that 4) this was kind of my second career. 

I ended up getting like 3 offers at once: one for a business-oriented post doc, one for a FAS, and one as an Engineer—all from applying, not networking. A couple of recruiters really liked me though bc I was responsive and appreciative, and there was a lot of early stage interview activity from them. 

All of these came in at the same time, around July of that year. I’d started applying in earnest in January and defended in May. I took the Eng I position at a startup and started at 6fig, bonus, and stock options. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made—my boss hired me bc she liked my hustle, gave me so many opportunities and I capitalized on everything she gave me. They promoted me and paid me for it. 

TL;dr: I landed a job in industry right out of grad school but it wasn’t easy and took a lot of work and about 6 months.
