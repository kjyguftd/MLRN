"I'll say it time and time again. 



Never buy during a Bull run. Never buy within 1 year of a bull run because there will be dead cat bounce(s).

1 full year after the bull run, start DCA your buys, purchasing once a month, as if you're putting money away in a savings account. This may continue for 12-36 months of the bear cycle.

When the bull run starts, simply sell little by little DCAing every major price spike. 

  
TLDR: Stop buying during a bull run. YOu're adding to price volatility, attracting all the boom and bust investor bros that leverage shorts and cause huge price swings that are not good for a currency. We need to sell during a bull run and buy during a bear market. If we all did this, the price of BCH will have higher lows, and lower highs, which means better performance and stability as a currency.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTM0NBNllsTTdSSmtBWFV1SFFydnpldjJSQzBtc21INGY2NGJ2bFYzRmIyQnJ0OE0xeGtwcWJsdk9zal9qbGtPc19BOEk2WHZoZ3hMQVA3MEdoV2N0OGh5MjlQV05wVGJPZlk0R0RnbThlZnc9

"You want to push the Cash?
I have the Idea 
To create a Food Farm Association, with Warehouse, the Currency is Bitcoin Cash, than everyone is a Shareholder/Investor and Customer) Owner at the same time!
I am a professional Builder and Farmer from Bavaria, high qualified and hot!

To start the new World!!!
A garden need Internet and facilities, than it produce permanent Food....

Irrigating 1 ha of land costs 1BCH (450‚Ç¨) and simply brings 1% real, private growth, every day!!!
that is not an investment, it is life insurance for the whole family and for generations!
The average German owns shares in the meat business, the concrete business and a car!!!
no values, just existentially expensive garbage!
A productive garden is the best medicine against EXISTENTIAL FEAR!
and virtual, machine-counted money, the cleanest solution!!

Food has VALUE, Value is money, ...and still food for Free!!!
I love this Idea...

>However, it seems clear that economic nodes have a lot of power, and in particular centralised exchanges appear to have more power than miners.

In theory, assuming said CEX balances the books, the miners could collude to block tx from BitFinex or any sort of CEX cartel, and there's not much they could do except play whack-a-mole forever trying to obscure their tx, or take the capital they've already earned, and start mining. As long as the CEX has a business though, it's a good bet a miner can always sell to a competitor, or even P2P. I'm not sure if they have more inherent power. More real world influence, maybe, but the market while gimped still carries on without the CEXs, but if the miners bring the blocks to a halt, or mine all empty protest blocks, there's not much they can do in answer, other than maybe in the short term running an unsecured fork",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWFlmdG9JU1ByUGgwXzU2QThxdk1MQVBvQTJ2TVhSU2VPbGVuN0JjWE0yLTdfOUpLVmRSZW82dThIMHU4YkVqbU84Mzl3QlNJSmdlaWpZNjk3OVVESVE9PQ==

"> The authors seem to make the claim that miners wield the most political power within the Bitcoin ecosystem because they have the largest capital investment, but due to cultural or psychological reasons, they deferred to the seeming 'authority' of Bitcoin Core.

I also found myself frowning at that thought . It was frankly not falling in place with earlier conversations I've had with Roger. It felt like a shortcut to avoid overcomplicating things for the reader.

The basic concept of Bitcoin is to balance out a free market. A market open to competition and selfish interests because those are directed towards building the whole.  
As such, miners just mine the most profitable way and holders & users of the coin just hold the most useful coin, which closes this circle by making the miners get paid more.

Each of those has political power.

The problem in 2015 - 2017 was that the circle was corrupted and as a result there was no open market. There were not really any alternative coins to pick from. There were no ways to profit as a miner by simply giving the middle finger to Bitcoin Core.  

This is the reason those miners kept on following as the threat were always there. As part II showed very clearly, the people behind bitcoin-core were not afraid to use any and all means needed to keep miners in line. They have shown they could and would bankrupt miners and pools that went against the narrative.

Anyway, just read the book... It's still very much on-point about everything even though this was a bit of a shortcut to avoid complexity.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVMU55MUNKMlFwb0h2dUxfbzJBUVVOWjkybFlpOThnbmhXQjd1MnlLc0FkNkVrRkw4Rm9fNDRvT0VyRkdiZmhUZjhPblNHMTRsYkh3ZUQyRjFTVmtWaFE9PQ==

" the whole thing with percentage blocks mined with a flag was likely responsible for the thought that miners have political power.

The initial idea was to avoid a hard set fork-date and instead do it when the miners have upgraded their software to the latest. And we can know this is the case by the new software putting a marker in blocks.

So there were websites that counted the percentage of blocks in the last week to get a feel when the miners were ready and we'd see the upgrade happen.

That was the intention, that is how it was designed.

Like all Network, we had to start somewhere. 

If Bitcoin Cash is so good (in comparison to thousands of coins out there), why people are not using it? Just an analogy; What good does the best phone in the world brings if there is no one you can call? This is where Bitcoin Cash's reality sadly stands at the moment. 

People are not using Bitcoin Cash because they are unwilling to use Bitcoin Cash. Simple as that.

I don't have the definitive answer to why people don't want to use Bitcoin Cash, but, being part of the crypto community for the past decade++ have thought me that, Humans are tribal creatures!

Just imagine what kind of BTC dominant tribal-conformity pressure a normal person will face if that person use Bitcoin Cash. 

I have been called a scammer for just being a supporter of BCH. Imagine what a normal man-on-the-street would feel like living in that kind of community... I was that man, I would conform, easily.

1.
The BCH supply cap is fixed so the banks can print fiat money ala tether out of thin air and buy up more and more BCH over time, spread it out over thousands and thousands of wallets, coordinate dumps and price manipulations and price volatility until BCH has no possibility whatsoever of ever being used as a currency.

2. Any person can be assassinated, anyone trying to use BCH as a currency in their country or even apread the truth about BCH to the world. Satoshi didn‚Äôt disappear, he was assassinated and any last communications from him were sent from his hijacked accounts and his pw squeezed from me with him and his family under threat.

3. The exchangers are all under the 100% control of the central banks. They will manipulate BCH prices taking orders from the banks

But for sake of argument, if you were to be developing a merchant POS system for BTC.  The best way to handle it is have a POS system that handles BIP274.    BIP274 rather than providing a QR code with a BTC address and amount, will instead provide a URL.   That URL contains the payment details such as address/amount/fee/memo AND a callback URL.    So your wallet gets the payment details from the URL, signs the transaction, and sends the transaction to the callback URL, the callback URL examines the signed transaction and says ""this looks right"" and the MERCHANT will broadcast the transaction to the network.   If for example the signed transaction has RBF enabled, the merchant can reject the transaction and not broadcast it, or if the BTC TX fee is too low, the merchant can reject it and not broadcast it.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQkZsdmlaY0xjTXdseFlRYjBUTV9kMEIyLVQ2Znp6QW1qR01QbHJoejByMV9JOGhXMm00S0Q3ek5aY2lfSmxVcC1ia2xYTXIzdzdtSEU2dmRaSWdfcEE9PQ==

"At risk of giving an over-complex, you might also just create a tiny little application and compile that to do this job.

If you're capable of doing a bit of C++, it should be pretty easy using the Flowee libraries (pre-compiled available for [Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flowee/) and [ubuntu](https://launchpad.net/~flowee/+archive/ubuntu/ppa))

The creation of a private key is literally nothing more than ([real world example](https://codeberg.org/Flowee/pay/src/tag/2024.05.0/src/Wallet.cpp#L1544-L1552));

    PrivateKey privKey;
    privKey.makeNewKey();
    auto pubkeyhash = privKey.getPubKey().getKeyId();

To print that is a tad more involved:


    CashAddress::Content c;
    c.type = CashAddress::PUBKEY_TYPE;
    c.hash = std::vector<uint8_t>(pubkeyhash.begin(), pubkeyhash.end());
    const std::string chainPref = ""bitcoincash"";
    auto s = CashAddress::encodeCashAddr(chainPref, c);
    printf(""address: %s\\n"", s.c_str());
    // priv key in WIF:
    CBase58Data d;
    d.setData(privKey, CBase58Data::Mainnet);
    printf(""Priv key: %s\\n"", d.ToString().c_str());

(all above support classes are in flowee_utils library).

No, we can say 'get to fuck' to Reddit and use other platforms for tipping.

"Maybe I am a little confused about the connection between random key pairs and wallet addresses. I understand a little that I can generate random key pairs with SSL. Can I then generate addresses from that?

Eventually I would need to import into a wallet to retrieve and move the funds but they would all have been created and stored in cold storage. 

Maybe a way to look at it is that I'm building my own hardware wallet. I can use an Ubuntu live cd to create a temporary operating system. Can then install a new blank wallet and import the relevant keys.Then do the transactions and when done I remove the live cd and reboot. Everything was transacted and cleared. The remaining  keys are still safely in their offline file and never were exposed to hackers.

Another advantage is it separates the hardware, the key storage/data storage and the wallet software from each other.

"Sure, I'm using Ubuntu. Easiest way for me would probably be to call the RPC `keypoolrefill` with 1000000 e.g. and then after it's done generating you can call the RPC `dumpwallet` to save them all to a file. Then simply go through the file with a bash script perhaps, and call the RPC `validateaddress` to check if `isvalid` is true, and `getaddressinfo` to check if `ismine` is true. Save private and public keys to DB of your choice and done.

Some other options would be to

* use [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) offline or
* run a bash script and call the RPC `getnewaddress` (in the case of `keypoolrefill` possibly making your wallet unresponsive for some time).

"Firstly, an ""address"" that most people see can be considered to be an encoded form of a public key.

Regarding key generation, choosing random keys versus a HD style wallet depends on your requirements around re-creating those keys. If you have method to retain random keys forever and accept the fact there is no easy way to ""back them up"" other than copying them, then random keys probably provide some security benefit.

On the other hand, if you want to be able to copy those keys, or the method to create them for purposes such as ""backup"", then HD allows you to ""restore"" them using 12-word mnemonics, or similar.

To elaborate a little further, you can consider HD wallets to implement a ""tree"" of keys, where the leaves are child key-pairs; the public key of which is ""an address"". If you can remember the ""root"" of the tree and the child generation process, then you can re-create the entire tree.

At the end of the day, a key-pair is a key-pair. I suspect for the purpose you've described, you'll go down the random key-pair path.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWkhXdnkxcW1zcUJlcldRR3h0b0Q3VHJlLUZkUngxd2NDQW5CUlNySXJYODhUVnZJWE1IeVVMdGxwazltR0FfRzRxZnJULU5lQk5uTGw0bHhiVjQzTlE9PQ==

For several years, r/btc hasn't been a good space for discussing new ideas outside a small 2017 time capsule so many people are still in; people that Roger picked are largely responsible for that.

EDIT:

If anyone wants to begin venturing outside their 2017 time capsule:

Tether collapsed in Oct '18. The establishment bought control of USDT in Nov 18, then used markets and credit to migrate miners to the US to create a throttlable load for energy markets. That's up to 2020.

"> Ver naively thought the US was a fair and open business jurisdiction.

This statement makes little sense unless you specify the time period you think Roger held these beliefs.

If it was in his youth or early business career before he gave up his citizenship, I would say that's probably typical of most US citizens.

> Ver threw his credibility behind Mt Gox before insolvency

Regrettable, but one can see how young he was at the time, so in this case I would chalk that up to some youthful naivete.

> Ver was still in the small blocker camp until the NYA got rugged in Nov '17.

I think this is a strangely unfair characterization - Roger had supported block size increase efforts throughout the preceding years and just because he supported NYA doesn't mean he was ""in small blocker camp"".

Roger did NOT speak out against other (non-NYA) efforts to pursue a block size increase.

IMO this is fully consistent with a view that the market can provide alternatives for users to voluntarily choose.

> Ver tried to negotiate with CSW to keep the BSV crowd with BCH in Nov '18.

I don't think he ought to be faulted for what I would consider a good faith effort at the time to keep the Bitcoin Cash community from fragmenting.

It is also easy to speak with hindsight on this, but at the time the bad faith efforts from nChain, CA and CSW were not as well understood as they are today.

Let it be remembered that BSV decided to create their own client and fork off in Nov '18. That's not Roger's fault, and while not negotiating with them might have resulted in time better spent, they would've forked off with more certainty under that scenario.

> Ver initially supported ABC's IFP plan.

The ABC episode illustrated that when it comes to protocol decisions, Roger Ver can have his opinion, but the broader ecosystem isn't necessarily going to follow along with it uncritically. 

> Ver vetted and invested in Mark Lamb and Coinflex.

This resulted in much damage to BCH holders and the collapse of the nascent SmartBCH side chain project, that is sure.

As I recall the outcome of the court cases were mostly in Ver's favor here, no? That doesn't make it all right, of course.

> Prior to the most recent drama, Ver had a mod on r/btc who would serially harass incoming developers‚Äïand sometimes long standing ones.

Can you point to resources on clustering analysis that would obviously contradict Ver's claims about CashFusion being sufficiently opaque?

It makes sense now that Roger tapped you, considering his friendship with Erik (and probably you as well) from back in the dinosaur era.

Each side of the fork was considered ""Potentially BCH"" and there wasn't a naming preference given.  For example ""BCHABC"" and ""BCHN"".  Neither was ""blessed"" with the brand, but instead a period of market action was allowed to discover price, and the more valuable (and therefore, higher hashpower) was crowned ""BCH.""

**THAT DID NOT HAPPEN WHEN BITCOIN SPLIT IN 2017**

Instead, the New York Agreement - **which Roger signed onto but did not understand** ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6cw7zf/why_is_no_one_talking_about_the_fact_that_antpool/dhye4kg/)) - sealed the deal: miners would activate Segwit, and exchanges would call that ""Bitcoin.""

So I think what we're looking at here is some blame shifting.  The CEO of Bitcoin.com signed onto the NYA apparently without even understanding what it was signing onto.  Hell, who knows how many other signatories knew what they were signing onto?

In fact, Roger, Brian Armstrong, Jihan Wu, and other BCH-aligned signatories to the NYA should never have gone along with it.  But Bitcoin was deemed ""too big to split"" and thus fair price discovery never happened.  But that's history now.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvb1lsZ1R6Yk9lTkZyV2ZEMGJYQXZid1I2ejZfQjZDQTNCYjJ6a2hvTnNadDE2aXBLN3l0NmkyNEdVNnNBNGdlQmx1dGNzc1JOXzBBMkxYQnE5aktJRHc9PQ==
"Right. Major things happened related to bitcoin markets and mining after the hashwar that people in the r/btc bubble are oblivious to. It's not part of the 2017 narrative, but it's how the hashwar was actually won and BTC dominance is actually maintained, currently. 

If people in Bitcoin Cash are incapable of looking at facts that fall outside the 2017 narrative, or things outside a cult of personality, then they're doomed to keep falling into traps as a community.

Looking at how tens of billions of tether actually got distributed is relevant. Understanding who it got issued to, and the seriousness of that person will help you understand why it's not imploding tomorrow. And finally, someone else in Bitcoin Cash should understand how BTC mining makes real money in real life selling and stabilizing real commodities.

"Hi,

GREAT ! What a speech !

when reading here about ABLA a couple of days ago,  
I really was wondering why I didn't read anything about it in the press media?

I mean, being new to crypto trading, I spend around 2 hours / day  
reading the news , and VERY rarely see BCH mentioned.....  
Even the last halving beginning of April was little mentionned in the news.

Being new to crypto, my question is ""WhY"" ?

Why is BCH not in the news ? .. nevermind actually

Coz the Question today , regarding your speech, is : HOW to change that ?

Should I pay influencers to ""tell the world"" ?  
Should I setup marketing campaigns ?

Please any ideas / pointers welcomed

"My previous work and contributions to Bitcoin Cash are well known. In addition to creating videos, I have contributed to translating various projects to help people understand Bitcoin Cash in their local language. Some of the work I have done includes:

1. Translating the Bitcoin white paper into Hausa.
2. Establishing a blog where I posted educational articles about Bitcoin Cash.
3. Translating Electron Cash into Hausa via Crowdin, a project that involved translating 15,693 words from English to Hausa.
4. Translating Unspent.cash into Hausa.

All my work focuses on educating the Hausa community about Bitcoin Cash. I hope the community will consider my efforts and support this campaign. I relaunched the campaign with the community‚Äôs advice and reduced my scope, focusing on two deliverables that aim to educate people about Bitcoin Cash.

Support my efforts to continue as I have already delivered many successful projects in the past. We have raised 5.38 BCH out of 28, and we hope the campaign will be funded before it expires in the next 12 hours.

">  Error: Waiting for Hotwallet. You have any idea what that could mean?

For internet companies a ""hot wallet"" is a bitcoin(cash) wallet that has money on it AND is connected to the Internet. This means the service can make transactions from it quite quickly. The opposite is 'cold storage' which is typically offline. Sometimes a piece of paper in a safe. It will take a lot longer to access these funds as humans and safety protocols are involved.

Because there are two wallets, maybe the hot wallet simply got empty and needs to be topped up from the cold storage before it can pay out.

Or maybe some server or service is down. One can only speculate.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3RXVpQlVTVXM4dERVd3VjZWxrQUt3eWJYVVcwY1lxem1MYXNiaGduQWtRbmhRX2pvdWRpVjlHWUZHMVU5LVR2cHdadlY1b1pBeDZ0elhpTDlwLVlQWmc9PQ==

"In response to your questions:

1. **Buying BCH** - The well known exchanges are the easiest places to buy BCH from. Although it's not physical cash, it's easy to obtain. You can check out [https://www.coinbase.com/](https://www.coinbase.com/), [https://www.binance.com](https://www.binance.com), and [https://www.coinspot.com.au](https://www.coinspot.com.au). I'm not sure about buying it with physical cash; as the world is going cashless, I don't think this option will be around for long.
2. **Selling BCH** - The main exchanges are probably your best bet for selling your BCH. I like Coinbase, Binance, and Coinspot, but there are many others. A quick Google search will usually find some sensible options. Selling with cash is a bit harder as I don't do this; however, if a friend wanted to buy some, I'd sell some to them. If you have customers paying in BCH, you could take cash, sell them some BCH, and then accept any further payments via BCH. This way, you're starting the cycle.
3. **How Can Customers Buy BCH** - Again, the main exchanges are easy to use. You could also sell your BCH or buy on behalf of your customers, as mentioned above. Sell the BCH to them, even make $1 on each transaction, but only accept payments for other goods and services via BCH.
4. **Mobile Self-Custodial Wallets** - I use the Selene wallet ([https://selene.cash/](https://selene.cash/)). I use it because it's solely a wallet and doesn't try to sell me other services, plus it supports the Bitcoin Cash community. The [Bitcoin.com](http://Bitcoin.com) wallet is also okay; you can buy BCH through it, so it's convenient. Both are easy to set up.
5. **Running a Node** - I'm currently running Bitcoin Cash Node v27; it's exactly the same to set up as a Bitcoin node. You just need to open port 8333 on your router and allow incoming connections. Other parameters within the config file can be adjusted, but as you've already run a BTC node, you'll be aware of all this. Visit [https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/](https://docs.bitcoincashnode.org/) for more details.
6. **Additional Notes** - Regarding specific details on how to perform each action, you will need to check the mentioned exchanges for their registration steps; I can't recall all the details off the top of my head. The wallets simply require you to click 'install' from the Apple or Android app store and include options to send or receive. If you have used a Bitcoin wallet before, this should be second nature to you. The same applies to running a node, but I've linked the documentation should you need it. If I've missed anything, my apologies.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3bW8tU0oxX0ZXeFQ5RUlWdkQxX3pPR3pCWGRRcTNOZTNVQWdmVTFmX3Axd1hWVFBjM3BKTUlzaVd3R3FhS3k4YXdyUWhvVlRZOWxQLVlaSmxfN0lHa1E9PQ==

"The non-kyc fiat/crypto on/off ramps really don't exist at this point and I'm with you....they're desperately needed! LocalBitcoins was killed years ago and that was the best option around. 

BitGree really is your best bet to convert fiat to BCH without going through a centralized exchange. The issue isn't BCH, the issue is the stranglehold and control tied to fiat currency.

Unless you can find someone willing to tranfer you BCH for cash, you're going to have a hard time acquiring BCH without some initial form of kyc.

Now, if/when you do acquire BCH, there is CashFusion through the StackWallet for anonymity, so you can ultimately achieve your goal.

Again, this isn't an issue with BCH (or any other crypto)...this is a controlled-fiat issue. Unless you're offering a product or service and get paid P2P in BCH, you're going to have to get creative to convert your fiat (digital or paper) into BCH (or any other crypto) without kyc. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

">I'm here confused about how they created blockchains like monero and BCH, open source GUIs and CLIs for your nodes and wallets, but no built-in DEX exchanges.

I hear you, but as stated above; LocalBitcoins was a huge deal for years. It was MUCH easier to onboard from fiat to crypto without kyc in the past.

There is no bigger threat to fiat currency than decentralized, self-custodial BitcoinCash. The clowns running things have known this for a while, but figured it would just be a flash-in-the-pan that wouldn't amount to anything. When the idiots realized that crypto actually had teeth, they began paying attention and attacking/shutting down all the non-kyc on/off ramps.

It's about control. It's always about control and the only thing more easily controlled than fiat is CBDCs (which is the ultimate goal). We can beat them at their game, but education and time are of the essence! 

Because things like Monero, Zcash, Zano and CashFusion on BitcoinCash exist, I'm not too worried about onboarding via a CEX that uses kyc. Once you're in crypto you can move, swap, bridge, trade to any other crypto of your choice (some easier than others, of course) or conveniently ""lose all your crypto in a boating accident"" if you so choose.

It's not ideal, but for now...thems the breaks. I do remain hopeful that a non-kyc solution will emerge soon, however.

Your objections above are not a reason to opt out of BCH, in my opinion. Again, you're going to run into the onboarding kyc issue with ANY crypto. You just have to get creative or use the solutions currently available.

The more important issue/factor, in my opinion, is actually using BCH as P2P Electronic Cash once you have it. Making fiat go away by making it irrelevant is far more important than using non-kyc to convert your fiat to BCH, IMHO.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cWpndDFmQUxXbXF0NGxfc1VHMHZQc2ZCamo3OW9mb29yYThEUjVtMzJGVzlPbXBZZWh3VHNiWVBxdFBYcHQydV9lYzlvUEJXSUMyZTVZOFpMNy1OSUE9PQ==

I can't find Monero or BCH to be worth as much if it's not useful enough, most online establishments don't even know BCH, not even some of the most free-thinking ones, including some of my personal cloud hosting services. Let alone physical shops.

BCH needs us to be interested in it in the first place, it needs possibilities. If I know I'll be able to swap it for anything else, I'll buy BCH. Otherwise it might just not be worth it.

"There are plenty of ""gates for the transition""...just [currently] none that are non-kyc.

I just completed a trip to Europe and back using nothing but BCH. BCH has more P2P merchants than just about any other crypto. Yes, it does vary by area, but overall, BCH is the most accepted P2P cryptocurrency out there. Very few merchants actually accept BTC anymore due to confirmation times and ridiculous transaction fees. BTC has been defanged, hijacked, crippled and the current narrative for it as a digital-gold/SOV is a complete bastardization of its original, intended purpose as P2P Electronic Cash. 

You can buy as many prepaid visa or mastercards with BCH via CoinsBee as you want and spend them anywhere visa/mastercard are accepted. Many people live exclusively on BCH this way.

To my knowledge, there is a BCH>XMR atomic swap in the works, but you can also swap BCH to multiple other cryptos on current CEXs. 

I'm with you. Use multiple coins if you deem it necessary. I just think BCH currently has the best shot at replacing fiat altogether, which is why I'm a big proponent of it.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VkRGN1NuSmVsU2RyOV9XZmk0aW12anZxcGUwTjByQjFZekxramlMUTZ5cGhXbzFFRFkzT1FkVjRuajBRR2hvTnZaeTZ3bzhNcmcxM2ZZWWZOS1ZKNEE9PQ==

"I got involved with BTC in 2012.The vision for it was a lot more ""noble""then with goals like bring banking to the billions of people without access to banking, as a replacement to the scalping remittance  companies (i.e. Western Union et. al.), a replacement for credit cards etc. 

I was the organizer of the local Bitcoin Meetup for a couple years but the discussion got old really quick as the only thing  that was talked about was the price. Gold fever and hoarding took over.

I'm working on a web app to enable websites to earn crypto (more noble to earn it than gamble for it IMHO). I couldn't possibly use BTC for the settlement layer because of their high and open ended transaction fees. My app works by users pre-funding their account and an entry level spend of just $5/month. High transaction fees not only stopped me from using BTC but it also is against everything it stood for when it started.

Back then there was a big effort towards merchant adoption which has pretty much failed. What merchant in their right mind would want to transact business with ""hodlers"" that have a death grip on their BTC? 

B U T the problem that crushed merchant adoption was simply too few people had any! A merchant would jump through the hoops, go through the learning curve to accept it only to hear crickets when they did.

My web app could settle with fiat but I believe in crypto so I made it a crypto only system. I'm thinking all those websites earning it will become customers willing to spend it and that will draw merchants willing to accept it.

Some areas have businesses built around specific cryptos that don't exist elsewhere, so you might have more options with those even if you don't care about that specific coin. e.g. if a local company allows buying ETH with no KYC you can do that then trade it to BCH easily with a DEX like Thorchain.

"> We just need big investors would are not under big bangksters to see the game change vertically...

There seem to be very few of those willing to take a significant risk because much of their own wealth or ability to operate (e.g. businesses) is linked to the fiat world.

We also need the money of the future to be well distributed to the world, not just in the hands of few rich people.

Not sure if that will happen naturally - somehow there have to be incentives to drive it.

Most people are too poor to gain access to this sound money by investment. Instead they have debts. The road to getting this money in their hands is by them earning it. They must see a use, a purpose, in order to want to earn it. I think that getting out of debt could be one motivator.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UzJReVpoMnhkbmpfSDMxWG5WMUdqZkFUTmptOFo4Y0l0UWlhbXBTVTF0d1MzdEtIcGswQ19FS1pUSEZRNmJLVUVMSHdOVHQ2bFliM1FlbjNQMlVNSnc9PQ==

1. You can lock UTXOs manually to prevent AuthHead of a token to be accidentally spent or even automatically for things like Cashfusion.
2. We show if an individual UTXO is a FT, NFT, if its mutable, immutable, if it contains a AuthHead and more through tags.
3. If you have too many utxos, a wallet might run into issue not being able to create a transaction so you can merge few utxos to reduce the number of UTXOs that can be used in a transaction.
4. Currently the wallet send all utxos in each transaction, if you want to specifically send out a particular amount from a specific utxo you can do that

A bit ironic given that your post contains a suspicious domain.

Anyway, running a BCH node on the same machine as a BTC node is possible, but you usually have to do more work than just changing the port.

For example, you have to make sure that they're not trying to access the same `$HOME/.bitcoin` data directory.",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1N3JkaUlGVGJkVzF2ZklKalYyOGdkUTZ4TXo3MzBYRFZ0Y28zYVNXVmtxbEYtWm11bUM0dm85VG10aU03NE8zQXRteUxVSWZILUFOd2hCMUtzcjQwNVE9PQ==

"Don't know how you set up BTC Core node, ~~nor which BCH full node software you procured~~ (EDIT: looks like it was BCHUnlimited software), so anything is possible, and there's no sense for me to comment further.

Glad it works for you.

p.s. changing port numbers by increasing +1 is not a good idea with Bitcoin node software because while 8333 is used for the p2p protocol, 8334 is used by default for RPC control, at least by the BCH node software you seem to have downloaded.

If you need to install both Core and BCH on same machine, make sure one of them uses a very different range for the P2P and RPC ports, like e.g. 9333 & 9334",r/bitcoincash,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1S3hoTF9Wemk0R1JZN2lmWHBHVmFUejd1NlBQTk8zNEhLeHBROWVucUZFLXk2ZlpyNldFSFBGV29CRWhnX0tyc3Y2UHVSdUk3Zkg3YkVody1KZjl1QUE9PQ==

To get started, you can buy BCH on exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, or eToro. For fiat cash, you can use services like BitPay or Coinmama.

"It's bullshit for two reasons:

1. Assumes transaction volume will not increase substantially before block subsidy ends (block subsidy exists BECAUSE satoshi knew that for a long time transactions fees would not be enough to sustain miners). 

2. Incorrectly states block subsidy ends in 2035, when in reality it ends in \\~2140. 

So in 115+ years if there aren't enough transactions to be a realistic miner incentive then yes the chain would die. 

For example, if BCH is processing visa level of transactions by that time (1700 tps, or around 1 million transactions every 10 minutes which is approximately the average block time) for $0.01 transaction fee average per transaction that is $10,000 worth of transaction fees per block, plenty of miner incentive. 

Also this guy is cherry picking blocks to make current transaction fees look as low as possible. Look at this chart for more info: [https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/total-transaction-fee](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/total-transaction-fee)

I had change from a bitcoin transaction ($10 or $11 worth of bitcoin through one of those bitcoin machines. The time range was 2011-2016?)
 I was trying to buy something from someone who only took bitcoin. I was agitated putting cash in and so much percentage (gas fees, processing fees possibly?) 
I deposited cash a second time to ensure enough money to cover these random fees. I saved the seed phrase and saved picture of the address the machine gave me. I cannot recall the name of the machine but i remember where the bitcoin machine was.
I called different bitcoin machine companies who had machines hack during that time. i NEVER GAVE THEM MY SEED PHRASE.  
i‚Äôve tried my #address the machine gave me and my name. They stated there was no money.

"Copied response from PM:

> Have you compared the outputs of your algorithm with the output of other AES encryptors?

Yes, the first two links of the web app are to other AES implementations. They give the same results and are compatible.

> BTW what is the advantage of using your Javascript app comparing to just booting up air-gapped ubuntu LiveCD and using something like OpenSSL, GPG, CryptSetup or even Veracrypt from command line?

Please note my HTML is also meant to be used in an air gapped setup.

Ease of use. Very few people will know how to use OpenSSL from the command line. My app also checks input is correct and gives nice explanations or error messages. I don't know if command line OpenSSL does, but my experience with Linux says ""no"".

"Ah, I see you're considering the classic crypto ""buy high, sell low"" approach.

If you look at the 4 year crypto cycle, usually there's a dip post-halving and then the coin gradually increases in value over the course of a year. The last cycle, BCH got up to $440 in February 2020, dipped to the low $200s for a few months, and then had a steady increase from January 2021 all the way up to $1400 May 2021.

I'm not expecting BCH to get up to $1400, but it most likely will get back up to at least $600 again in the next year. So short term, you can at least recoup your investment.

"Bitcoin Cash definately has a future, and from a technical standpoint it is already today very impressive - but as you have noticed, this coin like most others, is traded primarily for speculative benefit and as such it moves up and down more based on speculative bias than it does on it's underlying utility.

I would argue though, that the underlying utility provides a floor under which price will not stay very long and that floor has been increasing over the last couple years, and given the people involved and the quality of their proposals for how to move forward I am optimistic that Bitcoin Cash will be seen in the top-20 for a long time now.

"I don't quite understand the buy and hold approach of any crypto. The idea is to get people to start using this thing as p2p cash. That means you spend it. You exchange it for goods. You want it to be the primary measurement of value. You want vendors to use it, price goods and services with it. You want its value to be the primary measure of stability.

If a vendors all over the world paying 3% transaction fees with credit card processor (ultimately transferring that expense to you as the customer) wouldn't there be incentive to switch if something could process your transactions for 0.5% fee while leaving the rest of the funds in a stable state and you could pay other vendors you depend on it with? Then we've arrived at utility and merit.

BCH can do this. BTC seems uninterested (but it's code afterall and code can be changed)

Currently people continue to think in dollars with all of their crypto. At some point, without any practical utility all of it is going to fizzle out because the asymmetric return potential will be diminished to the point that is less attractive than and other real productive asset with utility. That day approaches.

If you want to buy and hold something that has virtually no utility for the sole purpose of hoping just to get rich quick... BTC seems to be better positioned. But if you want to actually use this stuff to transact for everything (like cash is today) without the inflation issue BCH seems to better positioned.

"PSA: USA citizens have to be careful donating to orgs, as they may run afoul of various laws prohibiting financing terrorism. Punishments include prison, fines, Asset Forfeiture, and there can be additional consequences such as restrictions on future financial transactions, loss of licenses, and other civil penalties.

Just because it uses crypto, doesn't mean they wont track you and put you on a list.

So make sure to do due diligence before donating to any org, and make sure what you are doing is legal in your jurisdiction. It only takes 1 second to mess up your life over some small action.

Dont just trust everything is ok, make sure to verify, the penalties are super overwhelming if you screw up.

Unbacked stablecoins are already influencing the price of crypto significantly. That's very bad for crypto. But tether depeging is only one of potential outcomes of the situation.

"We are thrilled to announce the relaunch of Flipstarter Bitcoin Cash Mesh Network #5 in Cuba, despite the recent expiration of our previous campaign. Our commitment to promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash and ensuring privacy through mesh networks remains stronger than ever.

**Why Relaunch?**

Even though our last campaign expired, the demand for decentralized financial solutions and privacy tools in Cuba continues to grow. This relaunch underscores our dedication to providing a censorship-resistant and surveillance-proof network, empowering communities with reliable and secure access to Bitcoin Cash.

* **Enhance Connectivity:** Provide reliable internet access through a decentralized mesh network.
* **Promote Bitcoin Cash Adoption:** Facilitate the use and acceptance of Bitcoin Cash as a digital currency.
* **Ensure Privacy:** Implement robust privacy tools to protect users from surveillance and censorship.

Our mission is to foster a resilient and inclusive financial ecosystem powered by Bitcoin Cash in Cuba. We aim to:

* **Empower Communities:** Enable individuals to transact freely and securely.
* **Promote Financial Freedom:** Reduce dependency on centralized financial institutions and the state.
* **Enhance Privacy:** Protect user data and transactions from prying eyes.

The campaign is listed and active in the main Flipstarters site:

From our very first Flipstarter campaign, we have been dedicated to ensuring transparency and providing proof of work for every project. While some have requested that we show the faces or identities of our direct users, protecting their privacy is our top priority.
