"Hello u/ea_intraday

I have successfully set your limit command. If the price of Bitcoin **rises to or above $58,651.00** I will immediately execute the following trade command for you:
`!bitty_bot short max 8x`

This command will execute at $58,651.00 with no slippage.

**Note:** The above command has not been validated. If it is invalid, or you do not have enough balance to run the command when the limit command is triggered, the trade will fail to open.

You can always view your currently open limit commands on the leaderboard or view and delete them by using the `!bitty_bot limit list` command.

It’s possible they haven’t been sold yet. But at the very least once the balance in their wallet hits zero it will calm FUD and those tens of thousands of BTC Germany is supposedly selling will be no different from the other 2.4 million BTC sitting on exchanges.

What we know for certain is spot ETF’s bought $880.6 million worth of BTC in the past 5 trading days or around 15k BTC. Yet price hasn’t moved much in the past week.

"Since I've started following they are selling the coins between \\~ 7:30 - 19:30 UTC.  
Coins sent to OTC desk are never coming back, from what that I'm gathering .  
Only coins sent to exchanges are coming back, its possible they aren't TWAP/VWAPing the coins but are just using regular market and limit orders.  
Its probable that they are using limit orders that don't get hit and then they send the coins back to their address.

Now about the volumes, your assumption that dumping of coins will result in much higher volume is probably incorrect.  
High volume days are correlated with high volatility, I would argue that since we hit local bottom they caused a decrease on volatility as they sold into the correction.  
This is also evidenced by the ETF showing high inflows people were buying the dip and the Germans selling into it lowered the volatility.",r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZFVrTHlyc2FtaEsxTDlRS2RXeWkwMHpvMXVEeXVoem1BWWt5RHpDNTRIYkVfVHFrcVBrQlZOTXBhRVZiYm52SDVlOXpkUzZBbTFOdVRJMTJfMnFxM2c9PQ==

"Dude... fact is, their address has gone from holding 50k BTC to 0. So even if some of the coins they sent out today wind up coming back to that address... let's say like 2-3k... that's still a 47-48k (= 95%!) reduction in their holdings.

Of course, to your point, just because those coins aren't sitting in that address doesn't *necessarily* mean all those coins have been sold. But do you really think they're going to leave tens of thousands of coins sitting on exchanges for any extended period of time? That would be wildly imprudent of any governmental agency.

The most logical explanation is that they send a certain amount to the exchanges, and if the exchanges are unable to move all of those coins in a given day, they send the leftover back to the government.

"Except there's nothing to suggest an imminent stock market collapse, and besides, is there really any doubt that the Fed won't step in and cut rates the moment things start to look ugly? They can never resist playing hero by turning the liquidity spigot back on.

Also, everyone reflexively assumes that if stocks go down, BTC must too. And sure, in the case of some true global crisis, everything will shit the bed at the same time. 

But barring any such huge crisis, I think what we're more likely to see is a more benign, modest drawdown of the stock market--like 10%--just to cool off an overheating market. In which case, I think it's far from a given that BTC *must* go down as well. It's entirely possible that BTC just 'front-ran' the correction, and may well just go sideways while stocks correct.

">How can selling 4k btc cause the price to dump 5k but then dumping 40k

Because many reasons

1. the sellers aren't working in a vacuum there is different demand within different price and different time, you should know that.
2. for the same as 1\\* the first dumpage could have been caused by other sellers as well
3. the lower the price the less impact dumping same amount of coin on the market since buyers are buying with fiat mostly.

>or increase volumes

I've already explained to you, but here another fact for you assuming an avg of 5k sold per day that about $300M and overall volumes for BTC per day is around $17B.  
That makes the sell volume less than 2% of the daily volume, how exactly do you reckon this will be noticed by you?

>It's been established that ETF's buy via OTC desk. And if you have dealt with OTC desk, you usually can't deposit/withdraw like it's a normal exchange.

I've explained already that they are selling through exchanges and through OTC desks, I didn't see any coins returning from addresses that look like OTC to me but coins did return from addresses that I think are exchanges.

In addition I don't know where you think OTC desks get their coins? you think every buyer at OTC desk has a seller?  
I bet lots of coins that are being sold and bought through OTC desk are getting bought or sold at the market by the OTC desk.",r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYX25aRFNMN3hUYXFscWlBTkVTa0VfMVdhUG9ZcjVHaUFiQ2VRYXFpZ2ZRSHc1c01MNU0waUZ1cHRieFduMUZ5MkdZYUtCRU5OTXl2a3MxRUs2eUlNRlE9PQ==

"Because it's exchange based, you can't see 3k coins going to kraken, and assume that won't cause the price to trend down on kraken, this activates bots etc, if it's all bought up the volume should be way higher then 2% extra, but we've seen lower volume this week.  It just doesn't add up dude.  Not to mention we are below the 200 ema, which is acting as resistance below 59/60k this added sell pressure, plus the mtgox coins should have us testing 52k. I've resisted building big trades and been scalp shorting this below the 200, but something in my head after 9 years trading these markets doesn't add up. I could be wrong, which is why I am posting, and what i've learned is I am usually the outlier but my p/l speaks for it's self .   And OTC desks don't just let you withdraw at a whim.   Have you dealt with them? I use to own a mining operation and unless it changed very drastically, it's very different then placing market or limit orders on an exchange.   Anywho, I could be wrong there's a reason why the price is ranging here that I can't figure and I expect this weekend to trend upward and test the 200 and if we break above it, I do plan on longing the fuck out of it.

I guess the play is wait for a break above the 200 then long the fuck out of it, i rebought some spot I sold at 71.5k in the 54/55k area, but had bids deeper.

"low-key around $1B of ETF inflows during the past week.

Imagine the scenario where we have 3 downward pressures - the German 50k coin dump is actually happening, the gox distribution which has barely  stared continues over the coming weeks and we have the general summer lull (people on the sidelines) but there's enough buying pressure to keep us fairly sideways in the big picture, say above 50k all summer.

We come into autumn putting a couple of bearish distributions behind us, out of the summer lull and we've normalised 50k as a normal, or even low, price, and a good base for bull market phase 2 as we catch some headwinds from rate cut(s) actually happening, and maybe even Trump bing elected and following through on at least some of the pro-bitcoin sentiment - hell even just *not* being anti-bitcoin might be enough.

"On the daily, BTC’s is still into the fear (25), similar to the bottoming from Nov 23 to Jan 24. This and the ETFs being net positive through the dumps are good signs this may be the bottom. RSI is currently 43.9 and its average is currently 37.3 It is hovering around 58.3, resistances are 60.5, 61.7, 63, 64.5, 65.7, 66.7, 67.4, 69, 70.3, 71.4, 72.8 and 73.8 (current ATH). The nearest supports are 57.5, 56.5, 55.7, 54.5 and 52.9. The 100- and 200-day SMA are 64664/59121 and may act as resistance as BTC moves up again. BTC is approaching the upper portion of the downward sloping channel that it has been in since the beginning of June.

The weekly chart RSI is currently 50.1 (63.5 average). It has been in flag formation for 17 weeks with multiple touches on the top and bottom. It is currently on the lower end of the flag. Looking for a close above the flag on the weekly for confirmation. If this is a continuation pattern and is the midpoint, the target would be about 103.3k. Main resistances were noted above.

Bitcoin closed June out in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 64.8. Current RSI 60.8.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

"[Yesterday marked 6 consecutive days of net spot ETF inflows.](https://farside.co.uk/?p=1321) 5 of those were above average net inflow days. The record is 19 consecutive net inflow days.

[Germany](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/germany) has now depleted their BTC holdings entirely, down from 42.27k BTC a week ago.

Price remained fairly resilient despite Germany selling off thousands of BTC every day for the past week. Now that Germany is done, what happens going forward? Do consistent spot ETF inflows come to a halt or do they persist? If it’s the latter, perhaps this upcoming week will be time for price to begin ripping to the upside.",r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUzByaEhlWFViYWkzN19HcUZDZTAtbmRhbVhGa0pfU2diSDJLSm1IdE5BcXNsSWJZbTZFMUpBeEhoQThBTTBVRGJzMFktWkxXeFdOaGV5aE1kN0RRRnc9PQ==

RSI is currently 46.8 and its average is currently 37.6 BTC’s resistances are 60.5, 61.7, 63, 64.5, 65.7, 66.7, 67.4, 69, 70.3, 71.4, 72.8 and 73.8 (current ATH). The nearest supports are 58.3, 57.5, 56.5, 55.7, 54.5 and 52.9. The 100- and 200-day SMA are 64586/59204 and may act as resistance/support as BTC moves up again. BTC is above the upper portion of the downward sloping channel that it has been in since the beginning of June. This could be a breakout. A close solidly above it, with volume, would be confirmation.

The weekly chart RSI is currently 51.2 (63.6 average). It has been in flag formation for 17 weeks with multiple touches on the top and bottom. It is currently on the lower end of the flag. Looking for a close above the flag on the weekly for confirmation. If this is a continuation pattern and is the midpoint, the target would be about 103.1k. Main resistances were noted above. I see BTC moving up over the next 4 weeks to the top of the bull flag. But after that, with the way MM like to F… with it, I’m not sure which way it will go.

Bitcoin closed June out in the red with it’s monthly RSI at 64.8. Current RSI 60.9.

Good luck to all traders and DCAers.

"In my [previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1dzmewi/daily_discussion_wednesday_july_10_2024/lcmdd4k/) I pointed out a [bull div](https://imgur.com/Rfd1et0) that confirmed on July 5.

That Bull Div on the daily has now played out, successfully, on Today's Chart:
https://www.tradingview.com/x/S4sSSDFt/


We are hitting the first resistance now, based on: return to recent lower low (yellow line), [horizontal level](https://i.imgur.com/RVzLZKi.png) (royal blue lines, 2wk), psychological level (60k), and RSI is at higher high.  If you were doing a short term bull div play, you could exit here, e.g. leveraged longs.

I love bitcoin and of course am bullish.  Often these 1 day bull divs push us very very far, as our weekly is bullish as well, and bitcoin is awesome.  Good chances we see ATH before we see new lows or a drawdown as large as what we just went through (from ATH to local low, -27%, during last few months).  Funny the low almost perfectly coincided with when I [posted that twitter becoming insanely bearish and losing their shit](https://twitter.com/joyrider50/status/1809994575995695209).

Compare to the Bitcoin audience. Probably mostly urban, college-educated, mostly atheist/agnostic, at least somewhat comfortable financially. Should be interesting at least.

3.125 btc / 10 min = 3,150 btc made each week.

Wrong reasoning.

I don't even think that the people who hear about this will hear what Trump says about Bitcoin. They will see headlines like this ""Donald Trump speaks at Bitcoin conference"". That is building awareness amongst large groups of people, making people look for the first time, or look again. It's making the relevance of Bitcoin/crypto undeniable. It builds influence and credibility.

Let me put this in a way you might understand. Would you be saying the same thing if Biden/Putin/Xi Jinping were going to this conference? Would you still think it was an irrelevant thing? 

You're still viewing this through the lens of politics & personality when you should be viewing it through the lens of advertising. And like I've said many times don't obsess over the fact it is Trump with phrases like ""Trump Fever"". The point is he is a former US president and leading US presidential candidate, like it or not. In the same way if Biden went it would be ""US President attends BTC conference"" or if Putin went it would be ""Russian President attends BTC conference"" or for Xi Jinping ""President of China attends BTC conference"". They would all be a major deal! Trump, being who he is, attending a BTC conference is a major deal in the same way regardless of what is said.",r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZmJDSW1EdFdwSmp0VEpJb2YzQnpyOHQ5ZHEzMlVpR0NieElxOHN6emNVNnhlUW5DeG1EVVpHQ1VYWm4wX3Nsc2tkT2taZ2ZCc0owSjlkV1RvQVpONXREYUVkNlV2TTYxWHhkdC1pTjZiZEE9

"After BTC hit its local low of $56.5k on May 1st, price proceeded to rally 27.2% to a local high of $71.9k within the span of 20 days.

How does this bounce compare to that bounce so far? 18 days after $56.5k was reached, the highest price BTC reached was $67.6k, a 19.7% initial recovery.

An equivalent bounce off the low of $53.7k on July 7th would result in a price of $64.2k. We’ve already surpassed $64.2k and it’s been less than 18 days so this initial recovery has actually moved quicker than the one that occurred in May.

"Hello u/eagenda

I have successfully set your limit command. If the price of Bitcoin **falls to or below $59,000.00** I will immediately execute the following trade command for you:
`!bitty_bot close 50%`

This command will execute at $59,000.00 with no slippage.

**Note:** The above command has not been validated. If it is invalid, or you do not have enough balance to run the command when the limit command is triggered, the trade will fail to open.

You can always view your currently open limit commands on the leaderboard or view and delete them by using the `!bitty_bot limit list` command.

"[Mt. Gox has 139k BTC.](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/mt-gox) But is the 139k being disbursed all at once or over a longer timeframe?  Also, what percentage of the 139k actually ends up getting sold immediately upon receipt to trigger a taxable event?

Germany dumped 42.2k BTC in the span of a single week. That’s thousands of BTC being sold every single day nonstop for a week. Yet price never fell below $50k.

While Mt. Gox payouts could theoretically end up resulting in more selling pressure within the same timeframe as what we just experienced with Germany, it’s unlikely to be that severe.

If you are not already fully allocated, take advantage of buying while FUD from My. Gox is heightened as their wallet gets depleted. When we fail to reach a lower low compared to what we saw with Germany because sell pressure will likely not be as extreme despite the sizable disbursements, BTC is going to rip much higher.

Bullish.",r/bitcoinmarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncFVtRjFRYWZfT09TZ3JVdGVqS0ZmWUtzODBDTUVMcTBfSWhfNXFVRk8xTjNEZTEwdU94LVdFN2Q1d24tUVB2TmU3ZWl0Y2hPeUlJMGxKVnRILTU3c0E9PQ==

"What percentage of the 139k BTC does that end up being though in this initial disbursement? And after accounts get credited in 7-14 days, what percentage of that BTC is actually sold immediately upon receipt to trigger a taxable event?

Suppose the 91k BTC that moved earlier today ends up being how much the initial disbursement is for. 42.2k BTC would be 46.4% of that initial disbursement. Meaning, if the initial disbursement does in fact end up being 91k BTC, 46.4% of those holdings would need to be sold immediately upon receipt triggering a taxable event just to achieve equivalent levels of selling pressure that we saw from Germany.
