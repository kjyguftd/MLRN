"You pay more for streams than Spotify pays you

Because I don't think Spotify has a fixed value, they pay per stream, at least for small artists

Spotify are also very keen to ban content that makes them lose money (a very controversial change). I remember them talking about banning low-fi music and white-noise stuff, as these are mostly uploaded by the same artists to make money by creating big playlists, promoting them and putting their songs in a loop

IG, if you have a botnet of the size that would be worth botting streams, you can do a lot of other things that could make you a lot more money",r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPMTJnQnlJNVVuUEtDNGltTkJqanREY3VoSDRtQ013Mm9Wc2RGbk1zRjVJNXZNV1otbW5TQ2tLUGh3ckFfQ1RiZVNhaDZvaUFpN2tPa2ZvVGM5TUlHaFE9PQ==

"I mean, one we're not going to help you break the law, and two, are you new to the arcade scene? Like 99% of games out there are programmed with specific payout rules, even ones that don't award physical prizes, but especially ones that do. Even if you could change the payout odds remotely, you have to keep in mind that isn't a magic ""Next attempt wins 100%"" button. All it usually does is tell the machine that from this point on it's allowed to let people win, but you still have to have the skill, or potentially just luck to win regardless.

I get why you don't like it, but even if you could hack the machines, you're making a pointless effort. Not only are you probably going to get caught and end up in legal trouble at some point, but in the end that doesn't really accomplish anything. If you want to make a difference spend your time making videos or social media posts teaching people how these machines are rigged against them winning, or try to lobby your government for changes that would require these machines to be more upfront on the odds. Even then, you have to realize that end of the day human nature is that even when they know its rigged, people will still play anyway.

"just learn how Different Operating Systems work, you'll pick up with C and python easily. since you already have enough knowledge at the development end. just focus on OS, CPU architecture and bit of networking. If malware is your priority try improving your skills on C, VBS, Javascript, python and finally few bits of assembly. these are the most common languages preferred by other malware devs. Once you know how to use these tools your next step will be actually making and obfuscating malwares. while obfuscating you will have to learn about AV evasion methods and craft your payload for specific cases. This part is called resource development. Apart from resource development having knowledge of buffer overflows and exploit development can sometimes be helpful.

"First understand why things get detected. It mostly breaks down to 2 areas. Signatures, and heuristics. In older AVs, you just had to worry about signature detection. But as time went on, technology improved and now you gotta worry about detecting behavior. 

An unknown file that acts weird (i.e. open sockets to weird domains, performing discovery commands, using abnormal system resources, etc.) is gonna get caught eventually. This is why we go fileless and just take over running processes altogether. It's much harder to detect since it blends into the background. This should be enough to get past a regular home user's antivirus. But for a company with a defense-in-depth security, that's another question.

There are different ways to take over legit processes like process hallowing, DLL injections, thread execution hijacking, etc. They all do the same thing, but in different ways. For the most part, it involves finding a legit process with NT authority/system privileges, reallocating memory inside the process, then injecting your own code. Read up on memory injection techniques for the nitty gritty. But this is roughly how you might evade antivirus software.",r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQ0l6bXZJdk0wem0zS0daWXVmQlA4UVpfcms3RzlvNzl6LTMwc1dad3M1MGxDd1RWR2I5NUhsczhWODZDTUlOUGFFd2Y1VFNrVE12dFFlTmhQSXlzTkE9PQ==

"You should probably make your own thread for these types of questions, but I will be happy to answer them.

Yes, Python can absolutely perform process hollowing. If you are unfamiliar with the `ctypes` builtin, one of its functionalities lets you use the Windows API. I don't remember all the API calls offhand, but you can certainly call `CreateProcessA`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `Read/WriteProcessMemory`, and `Get/SetThreadContext` from within Python.

As for ""write DLLs"" I'm not sure what you mean. Yes, Python can modify and write files to disk. It can also modify running process memory as well. If you meant ""use DLLs"", the answer is also yes. A simple example to call the MessageBox export from user32.dll would be:

    ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxW(0, ""World"", ""Hello"", 1)",r/blackhat,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYm4xM1ktWHVMR0hOVFlBa1k3ano4aGhSX1U4RzRSdHBJNDdGcGM2T2hNazBFOHZIWU5yeVJ5VUxmMUNHRHNReU9TUkMyb0ZpZU51bkdFcnU3RVQzS2c9PQ==

"The answer for this is sorta dependent on who you are. For instance, if you were a corporation with an EDR at your disposal, you'd probably get an alert with all the details that this was popping off. The detection will tell you the time it happened, the user running the command, what process they took over and any embedded commands in the process. From there, you'd have a good idea where to look. In which case, I'd tell you to isolate the affected host, stop the process from running, disable the user that ran the command, find the root cause of the infected process through various threat hunting techniques, and mitigate from there. 

But if you were a home user, then that answer is entirely different. Home users don't have SIEMS, intrusion prevention systems, EDRs, or other alerting methods to even be notified that something is going on to begin with. Most people facing these attacks probably wouldn't even know until after the fact that something even happened. But if you were suspicious of a process, I'd look into Velociraptor by Rapid7.
