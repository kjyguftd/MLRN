BTC, BCH, BSV, XEC, BTG.

They all have fixed supply, nobody knows which will outperform the other over the coming days, weeks, months, years, or which will gain or lose in terms of the stock market, commodities, REIT, ect.

The fact that they are fixed supply says nothing about how they will perform in the future. Most things with fixed supply will be outperformed by other assets, with or without fixed supply. Land, despite being fixed supply and guaranteed to increase in USD terms, is still outperformed by market indexes even when shares are diluted.

Or to illustrate the point another way.

Dogecoin has \\~2x the market cap of BCH, with 5B yearly inflation, knowing this alone, can we tell which will outperform the other over the next 10 years?

SHIB, has fixed supply, 1.5x the market cap of BCH, will it outperform Dogecoin or BCH in the 1-10 years?

Something being fixed supply tells us almost nothing, the supply rapidly expanding means every unit will lose value over time, but the supply being fixed does not mean every unit will gain value over time, not in real terms, not compared to the market.

That's literally what makes ponzi sachems attractive.  

What makes the bitcoin network valuable is it's P2P digital cash. Money has no value, it's just simple accounting for the exchange of value. 

An accounting system that depends on steeling value from the network participants at and ever increasing rate, creates demand for an honest accounting system (like Bitcoin).

">Thought, there is nothing nefarious, hidden or deceptive about what BTC is or how it operates.

""They"" wouldn't need to sensor people if that was true.

>It is possible for someone to buy BTC not knowing what it is or where the price comes from

While true, and true for most investment opportunities, the world does not need more useful idiots.

>I think everyone in the world can know exactly what BTC is and how it works, with virtually no interest in economic transactions, 

Very few know why BTC has a high price, **very few people.** know what the value is.

Price is what you pay, value is what you get. People are looking at price, and ignoring fundamentals around value. True Fact, even respected people like Isaac Newton, a maximization and the equivalent to the head of the FED, (aka the Warden and Master of the Royal Mint of the worlds grates superpower at the time)  died bankrupt after loosing all his money in a Ponzi schema called the *South Sea Bubble*.

Isaac Newton, would be invested in BTC today for the same reasons he invested in the South Sea Company.

">Am I misunderstanding?

No, but at the time of the halving 12.5 BCH per block, lots of people short sold. 

Because of the algorithm if you mine more BCH, the difficulty goes up, and so the profitability goes down. One can rent mining equipment, and if one rented less than 1% of the mine equipment to mine BCH all the BCH, miners will just move to mine BTC. 

Difficulty just needs to go marginally higher then the profitability to make the other miners switch, that's still a lot cheaper than buying in the market and pushing up the price. 

That opportunity has diminished since this halving. That could partially explain some of the sorts being covered and the BCH price going up.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdWdSSUg2N0VvMi05VXM0aFRocVNGZGNPTXpDb256ZXptTnpIVmx4cVg2Y3llRGRlWGZwRHd5VW9qX08yRThrQlNVQkRlSnpLcy1TMUZmNmNqQWVnbkE9PQ==

The value quote is Buffet talking about value investing right, assets and earnings compared to the price. Every crypto has 0 value in value investing terms, thought it can have use value for people. I'm not sure if you are referencing the value investing definition or the use-case definition of value. I don't think a single crypto has value in the value investing meaning.

I maybe overestimate how many BTC are held by people who knows it represents nothing other than a number on a ledger that people trade.

Bitcoin, and other crypto, goes on as long as it's listed and there are people who trade it. I don't think there is a lot of growth potential in BTC, in that most people living currently that will be interested in holding it are already holding it. But I still think it can continue on growing below market rates but above nominal USD rates, even if everyone knows what it is and how it works, because people actually want pure ponzi like that.

"I appreciate your point, however, i completely disagree. I'm currently running a full node and have been for the past 3 years on a mini PC with a 500GB SD card for storage, its been going great. When the blockchain gets too big i can just go and get a cheap 6TB HDD from amazon for about $150. Excluding the ABLA upgrade for the minute, even if all blocks (32MB) were full for an entire year, and averaging 10 minute blocks, with a bit of chatGPT math, thats 1.6TB (roughly) of transactions for the block chain, so that $150 6TB HDD can store roughly 3.5 years of transactions. Now anyone in the western world should be able to afford $150 per year for a new 6TB HDD, thats just over $10 per month to save. Even if we tripled the block size to 96MB blocks its still easily affordable for normal people at $30 per month (roughly). 

Adding to this, with the ongoing evolution of HDDs and storage, we have things like Seagate bring out a 30TB HDD. The price of this new tech will only come down, thus making running a node easily affordable for most people.

"Bitcoin Cash, in simple terms, is an upgraded, better version of Bitcoin that actually functions well as peer-to-peer electronic cash

I'm going to assume you know a little bit about cryptocurrency, what a blockchain is, how it works, why it's useful, how it's decentralized, secure etc.
If you don't know, the original Bitcoin whitepaper is a good place to start. I may link some explanations later.

Advantages of Bitcoin Cash
- Instant transactions, no fear of chargebacks - zero conf, No RBF
- Low fees - fraction of a cent per transaction of any amount
- Permissionless - you could make a wallet and I could send you some right now, with no banks, government involved
- Functions well at scale where other cryptocurrencies may not - larger blocksize, recent ABLA upgrade
- Decentralized, no central authority or developer dictating how it works
- Shared history with BTC before 2017, not a new coin, not a pre-mined coin. 
	It is not just a different version of Bitcoin, 
	it is a continuation of bitcoin from the very beginning of cryptocurrency up until the 2017 fork
	Does not force a limited 1MB blocksize, does not use SegWit, does not need a 2nd layer to scale
- Uses PoW, not PoS. Topic for another time
- Fixed supply, 21M coins. Deflationary, not inflationary
- Highly secure when used correctly with self-custody on a secure dedicated device
- Privacy - Single use receiving addresses, RPA, CashFusion
- Active development and passionate community actually working towards 
	peer-to-peer electronic cash adoption

Disadvantages of Bitcoin Cash
- Competing against a very large, highly speculative market that doesn't follow fundamentals
- Many different wallets, can be difficult to discern what's good, what's safe etc
- Volatility - problem largely solved with BCH Bull
- Negative perception after the BTC/BCH split - seems to be improving over time
- Lower hashrate, lower price and less general interest by comparison - 
	may change in the future as fundamentals become more important. 

Conclusion
- BCH is a fundamentally sound cryptocurrency which works as intended where other cryptocurrencies 
	may not or do not
- If you are interested in peer-to-peer electronic cash as described in the 
	original bitcoin whitepaper, then Bitcoin Cash is the cryptocurrency for you
- This is not financial advice, do your own research, don't put money into something 
	you don't understand, i am not responsible, etc
- Remember, the purpose of cryptocurrency is not investing, and not to get rich, 
	but to have a sound alternative to government issued and controlled currencies",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdDBmTDZRd01zR3kzUld5SV9NbDJxZ2F3ZXpkNWtRbGRQUEhnRDFJM0xKeWU0YUxUc0FDSy1qdDhCdFhrcnRfOGNkN3RaRG5sRFlzelpRUmE3OVBrWGc9PQ==

Once we implement UTXO commitments on a consensus level, anyone will be able to sync a node by downloading only the up-to-date UTXO set and the most recent blocks after the commitment. This amounts to ~5GB of data in order to get up and running.

It would be naive to say we've solved scaling for good, but ABLA is one of the most significant steps we can take to codify the fact that BCH is committed to scaling in the future.

Comparing these in the same sentence is a trap that maxis use as a talking point. Just repeating generalizations is easy, but details matter.

BTC = Expensive transactions due to small blocks. Instead they want you to use blockstreams liquid sidechain.

BSV = Scam hard fork of BCH led by a criminal and conman.

XEC = likely a security due to mining rewards going to devs.

"The executive branch 3 letter agencies pass laws which govern their specific sector that they're in charge of. The EPA passes laws regarding the environment. The DEA passes laws regarding drugs. The ATF passes laws regarding firearms. 

These laws that they pass aren't actually constitutional as they haven't been passed through the democratically elected members of the House of Representatives. 

West Virginia vs EPA decided this. This is a significant decision as it should create precedent that no other agency can pass the laws without going through Congress.

It was Vivek Ramaswamy, who was running for president but dropped out, who was speaking about this during his run. He had plans to cut multiple agencies by half in his first month in office. Trump tried to get rid of members of these agencies but was stopped by civil service protections. Those protections don't apply to mass layoffs, which is what Ramaswamy was going to bring. 

He was going to do it possibly by picking an odd or even number, and those who worked in the selected agencies with a Social Security Number ending in the chosen odd or even number, would be laid off.

"What makes you think I did not?



I should perhaps say that I did not use BCH every single day in the year 2018. For most of it I used it a couple times a week or month depending as I were using sites with BCH deposit/withdraw.



But I did use BCH daily for large parts of 2018, before, during, and after the stress test, I started using memo cash in the summer of 2018 an used that pretty much daily for months, I stopped using memo cash around the 2018 BSV/BCH fork as the network split up.



The evidence of my activity on Memo Cash around that time is on the blockchain as every action is a on-chain transaction with OPcodes, but I rather not link to an old permanent archive of my posts.



I also used Noise Cash when that was active, though that ran on a more conventional platform with user accounts, not everything was stored on chain. Other stuff at the time like that minecraftstyle 3D block space where blocks were place with transactions.



Now that I am walking down memory lane, I got $1 FlexUSD from Roger Ver, after that I technically got a bch transaction every day for interest in SLP format, until, you know what happened to CoinFlex. I don't really think that counts, but it is a fond memory. I still have the support emails from CoinFlex from not being able to withdraw in early 2021, but they gracefully let me at the time.

- I don’t care, right now BCH works well, BTC doesn’t. If that changes, then I’ll care
- Average person is not running a node let alone using a cryptocurrency. We already have big mining pools which you need to join to have any real chance as an individual miner
- You could say it’s important to be able to run a node even if you’re not mining, to sync the whole blockchain and verify it all yourself etc. Fair enough
- Moore’s law and such
- Pruning and UTXO commitments

Then you run the software.  And the software generates a wallet (or you load a seed or whatever).  Then it generates the addresses and needs to check with online servers to get the balance of your addresses.  This is where your IP and wallet can be related.

\\* private ones by the makers of the software in question - they will know your wallet and IP and might keep it private, might sell it to partners, etc

\\* public ones run by blockchain intelligence companies that exist to store big databases of IPs and addresses.  They then sell or make available this data to partners and customers. THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE.  If the software connects to a random server from a big list, you are probably hitting one of these.

\\* public ones run by community members who get it.  They don't even record the data for who is doing what.  But you can't really tell them apart from the above ones.

I believe my assesment was correct, but I don't have intimate knowledge of the nuts and bolts of how things work, I only have a *mildly* technical overview.


So when Tom says you need to walk the chain of transactions to rebuild the wallet, I listen. Though I have not seen a good reason why my [bloom like filter suggestion](https://archive.ph/mJA3z#selection-2425.0-2441.95) could not work


Perhaps

1. You could not make a bloom filter specific enough to cover hundreds of billions of addresses (extreme adoption) 

2. If you could it would be too large to be practical for mobile users

3. The cost to check **all** your **possible** transactions would be prohibitive on a mobile device.


Moving to even thinner ice than the usual,  I  think the above method wouldn't be able to 'find' multisigs unless they were marked in some way, or any non standard address.


Personally I see mundane day to day transactions happening on second layers, this would presumably keep the search space for possible outputs down to a manageable size for most users.


And in the future (if all else fails) the brute force method of downloading complete list of current addresses for each UTXO (low TB?) and generating the first billion wallet address ~32GB may well be practical and if all else fails paying someone to do it for you (which would you prefer to loose your wealth or privacy?) at scale I imagine it could be relatively cheap - walking the TB's of UTXO with sorted lists of 100's of users, by then it possibly could all fit in ram for a power user offering the *rebuild* service as a business.

> my question is for you and Tom: isn't it ultimately the local user's responsibility to know the addresses they care about?

I would say so, perhaps a wallet saves a snapshot of it's own UTXO's encrypted with the seed phrase in the cloud (storage perhaps provided by wallet) or just numbered list of what wallet addresses are 'live'


Though Tom seemed (at least partially) to be against this as he [argued one could have 2 *LIVE* wallets with the same seed](https://archive.ph/jkiSn#selection-3031.0-3045.225) and one wallet could not know what UTXO's the other wallet had spent (for me this does not seem to fit with the overwhelming use case of p2p cash)

"Imagine not even needing the UTXO set. When you receive a transaction you can just check the latest global state root, which is basically a hash of a recursive zk proof that the entire chain is valid, and you can use information from the transaction to construct a proof that the transaction itself is valid, and know if it's already been included in the current state root.

That said, I'm super excited for UTXO commitments. This is my first time hearing about them, but that absolutely does sound like an awesome step.

"He makes a lot of good points, but he also makes some bad arguments.  I’m not all the way through the book yet, but these are the ones that jumped out at me the most so far.  

1.  He constantly uses “cash” to be synonymous with arbitrarily small payments.  He makes the argument that “in the early days” the digital gold narrative was about how bitcoin could not be debased, but that later shifted to being a store of value and that latter narative is at odds with bitcoin being “digital cash” because cash, by his definition” means small payments.  He then goes on to cite the many times Satoshi used the term cash and the fact that he never once used the term “store of value.”  All of which is true.  But all of this is assuming satoshi was using “cash” in the same way Roger is.  I think that what Satoshi meant by calling bitcoin “digital cash” was that it could be used as a final settlement without any third parties similar to cash.  I don’t think his use of the word cash has anything to do with payment size.  Although Satoshi does talk about the possibilities of using bitcoin for small payments, I don’t see any connection between that and the term “cash.”  In fact that would be a poor comparison to physical cash because small transactions is not a strength of physical cash when you consider the cost of producing, distributing, and replacing physical cash.  

2.  I know this one will not br taken well here in this sub, but I’ll say it anyways.  He’s dead wrong about full nodes.  In his thought experiment where 100% of miners fork into a new chain and 100% of full nodes stay in the old chain, it is true that the latter chain with 0 miners would grind to a halt, but it’s also true that the former would being mining virtually empty blocks since miners contribute very few transactions to the mempool.  Both chains would be essentially useless at the time of the split, and either one could end up being considered the “real” chain depending on the details of why the chain split and how the users on both sides perceive it. 

Overall it’s a very interesting read and I’m enjoying getting a new perspective on the blocksize wars.  I was glad to see Roger on the BTCTKVR podcast.  It makes me hopeful we may move back to a single protocol sometime in the future.

"There is no real standard definition for ""login"" when related to wallet software.  So I'm not going to use that term.

When you load a wallet, the software will generally immediately connect to remote servers to check the balances and history of addresses in that wallet.  This happens before you have any funds on the wallet, before you make any transactions.

"I was there, in 2018, as the stress tests happened. At the time it degraded the performance of the network, I struggled to get my transactions through, and the site I used at the time had discussions about the issues using BCH. The transaction re-ordering was, if I remember correctly, one of the pretexts for the BSV/BCH split at the schedule 6 month hard fork upgrade.

There were never any test on-chain afterwards, other than one developer, I forget his name, which did a small scale demonstration by generating and broadcasting a couple thousand transactions using as script and showing it on TXstreet.

I am aware that there were claims about the main net handling 20 million transactions per day sustained no issue, which was just 32MB divided by 230 bytes per transaction times 144 blocks per day. It was never actually demonstrated on main net, not a single time. Which seems odd to me.

Ever other comparable block chain caps out around 1-4million transactions, at that point there is a backlog and a fee market starts to form. The only exception is BSV, which has done 5 days in a row over 40 million transactions, but I am hesitant to include that as it's virtually solo mining.

The real constraints on the transactions per on the actual network is not how fast a RPI can process blocks, or how long it takes for a 200MB+ block to propagate through the network.

The actual upper limit on average transactions currently is

1. The average block size miners choose to mine.  
2. The sustained amount of transactions that can be broadcast per second/hour/day before performance degrades and new transactions can't be added fast/reliably.

As I explained two here, you are correct ;-)

I mean, its practically all (non trivial) apps and wallets that do this, so hyperboling doesn't help build understanding.

If you come up with a different way of doing things, build it and make it better than the ones you're intending to break, then obviously the problem goes away.

To me the question of why it is and will stay scalable is not to answered by the idea of throwing away history. Sorry, I see that as a premature optimization at best.

The solution lies in today's tech already:

* user-wallets only ever need to scan the blockchain once. Ever. And then only a part of it. So if they start a wallet in 2015, they can ignore all data before that point.
* Wallets store state up until a certain date.  
this is why they only need to check for newer blocks.
* Wallet state can be backed up.

And last:

* starting a new wallet and moving funds from an old wallet to a new wallet makes one able to ignore all blocks before the new wallet was created.

"Thanks for the reply!

>But all of this is assuming satoshi was using “cash” in the same way Roger is. I think that what Satoshi meant by calling bitcoin “digital cash” was that it could be used as a final settlement without any third parties similar to cash. I don’t think his use of the word cash has anything to do with payment size. 

I think Satoshi was actually VERY clear on why he chose the word ""cash"" to describe his invention. Reread literally the first paragraph of the whitepaper's introduction, reproduced below:

>""Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. **The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,** and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. **These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency,** but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.""

So Satoshi was pretty explicitly seeking to create an electronic equivalent to ""cash"" (in the ""physical currency"" sense of that word) that would, like physical cash, (1) enable peer-to-peer payments that don't require a trusted intermediary; (2) enable truly-irreversible payments; and (3) have very low transactions costs, thereby enabling ""small, casual transactions.""

But regardless of what Satoshi meant by ""cash,"" he unambiguously intended for Bitcoin to have extremely low transaction costs, e.g.,:

“Once it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you could effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping coins in a vending machine.”

""Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.""

""We should always allow at least some free transactions.""

There's also the design choice of [making Bitcoin divisible to 8 decimal places](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1c0hgry/will_adam_back_debate_for_500000/kyx3x34/)! 

>He then goes on to cite the many times Satoshi used the term cash and the fact that he never once used the term “store of value.”

For the record, I think Satoshi obviously understood that Bitcoin would be BOTH a low-friction payments network / ""medium of exchange"" / electronic cash system *and* a ""store of value.""  Although, in one sense, I don't think ""store of value"" is truly a separate function of money. Expanded thoughts on this point [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bylauo/book_review_hijacking_bitcoin/kynvmip/). I suspect Satoshi may have deliberately downplayed the finite supply / ""store of value"" aspects of his invention to make it seem less threatening to TPTB.

>I know this one will not br taken well here in this sub, but I’ll say it anyways. He’s dead wrong about full nodes. 

I disagree. Some of my thoughts on the ""full nodes"" argument are outlined [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1c04oes/decentralization_question/kyv69ft/).

Here's a big-picture summary of my argument for why ""small-block-ism"" is so dangerously wrong:

1. It directly undermines Bitcoin's money property by increasing transactional friction when literally the entire purpose of money is to *reduce* transactional friction.

2. It is, unambiguously, a radical departure from the clearly-expressed intent of Bitcoin's inventor.

3. It prevailed via a campaign of extreme and outrageous censorship (a campaign that my recent no-warning, no-explanation perma-ban from r/Bitcoin suggests continues to this day).

4. It is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Bitcoin's security model (i.e., the idea that having ""lots"" of non-mining, so-called ""full nodes"" is necessary to keep Bitcoin ""decentralized"").

5. Moreover, even if that view of Bitcoin's security model were correct, it would, at best, only justify being careful not to scale *too quickly*, not a complete abandonment of additional on-chain scaling. And, given the massively deflationary nature of computer technology, the ""safe"" rate of on-chain scaling would still follow some underlying *exponential* trend.

6. It forces ""scaling"" to occur on so-called ""second layers"" that are necessarily-imperfect money substitutes that become progressively *more* imperfect as on-chain fees rise and the amount of ""leverage"" in the system increases (i.e., as the ""second layers"" grow in size relative to the tiny, artificially-constrained base blockchain atop which they operate).

Re: the last point, here's a more detailed post looking at the fundamental problem with the idea that we can ""scale Bitcoin with layers"": [Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bzjz5i/layers/).

This is just dumb.  No one is selling the lightning network.  It's open source.  It's not centrally controlled it's distributed geographically but not distributed in liquidity which is a legitimate criticism.

This is just dumb.  Either something you can't use has incredible value or you can use Bitcoin just not in the way you want and it has value.  The market is objective evidence for this.

Your analogy is just dumb based on falsehoods and logical fallacies.

Bitcoin has some unique qualities that no other crypto has been able to match.

If Bitcoin cash was a serious project.  It would change its POW hashing algorithm perhaps to a quantum safe algorithm.   

I think with the garbage that is runes and taproot it's naive to think you can have block sizes without limits.  People will apparently throw away a lot of money to spam even Bitcoin.  

BSV really drove the point home with its 10TB Blockchain.

">Bitcoin is not the internet. The internet scaled.

Maxis will try to tell you that “the internet scaled with layers,” which is of course an absolutely absurd argument. The “internet abstraction layers” have about as much to do with monetary “layers” as the layers of a seven-layer burrito. As I’ve written before:

If we *had* actually ""scaled the internet with layers"" in a manner analogous to what's currently proposed with Bitcoin, we'd have capped the bandwidth of all internet connections at some absurdly-low rate (perhaps 1-MB every ten minutes). And then told people, ""well, no, that's not going to be enough to allow you to do things like watch streaming movies, but don't worry, you can simply use the internet to look up the location of a 'second-layer solution.'  This might be a nearby library or DVD rental store that carries your desired film.  Then you can just drive there and pick it up. Simple and almost as good!"" 

Except even *that* massively *understates* the absurdity of the current situation because with Bitcoin we're capping the total capacity of a *shared* resource. So really, it'd be more like if we'd somehow limited the *combined* bandwidth of all internet users to some absurdly-small level, such that, as more people got online, the bandwidth available to each individual became ever-slower and more expensive.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWWnZycTFsUXdoQzZYM09aOG9kMmRHbEcwd1N3MEo2dkR2MWMweTF5UWVoQ0c3a0JyWkpicVI3SlA2X2lKaTRXcndzalc0bWx0ZGNMMVlqQXo4a1Z1SWt5dzB1dWdoVWZXNzYyYkhXaC1DUDg9

Most of which did a complete 180 just a couple years later when Bitcoin started to stop working when the moronic majority refused to scale the block size as originally planned.

"BCH Bull is a permissionless decentralised app, it utilises Anyhedge which is written in cashscript.
The smart contracts are done non-custodially on-chain and fully funded the whole time, and as such the risks are largely minimalised but not completely eliminated. 

There are two sides to a contract, hedge and long, and depending on which side you take, market movements, as well as supply and demand, there are different fees or premiums which you either pay or get paid and you can accomplish a different result 

Hedging is preserving your value no matter what, longing is high risk high reward gambling

The smart contracts rely on price oracles to determine payouts, ideally there should be many oracle providers, currently there is only general protocols, so this is theoretically a risk, practically perhaps not

You are also trusting the service itself to function the way it should and be free of bugs, malicious code etc

You could do a hedge contract with BCH to the price of BTC relative to eachother. If BTC rises and BCH doesn’t, you will receive BCH to make up for your loss of value in BTC terms. The inverse is also true. If BTC lowers and BCH doesn’t, you will end up with less BCH than you put in, but equal value in terms of BTC to what you put in when you did it

If BTC and BCH rise or lower exactly together in terms of USD and maintain their price ratio, you’ll get out more or less exactly the BCH you put in and either gain or lose value based on the cryptocurrency market itself moving

You could do this with BCH/USD instead and gain BCH as the BCH price lowers. If the premiums are good at the time you can get paid to do so

To do this you just go to the site, check the premiums, pick what you want to do, click stabilise and follow the prompts

">Competing against a very large, highly speculative market that doesn't follow fundamentals

Bitcoin Cash is not struggling because the market is highly speculative, or because the market does not follow fundamentals. Bitcoin Cash is struggling because it has got strong opponents. They did what was in their power, causing a delay of (slightly less than) 9 years in such indicators as liquidity, price or volatility. The 9 years delay looks bad, but the period will soon be over.

This is a disadvantage of the whole market, not a Bitcoin Cash disadvantage.

Indeed. Bitcoin Cash does have a high volatility.

i assume in a very similar way miners pick up these transactions and validate them into blocks using POW.

this seems Bitcoin could implement same feature if every bitcoin transaction required a signature from the private key of the receiving address.

So lets talk about the difference.

Apparently in Grin intermediate transactions are discarded. A to B to C, just cuts out B. and you have A to C.  

but then if C gives to D and D gives E - wouldnt that cut out everyone again and you will always have A to E.   In fact , after a million years, it will still be the original A to ZYHD << counting in base 26.

">Storing value is a use.

Actually, you are right. Storing value is a use. It just isn't a use that can give bitcoin a value.

As a logical statement, it is true.

As a causal statement, it is a fallacy reversing the cause and the effect. It is true that bitcoin having a value would cause a market for it to exist. Therefore, bitcoin having a value is the cause and the existence of the market for bitcoin is the effect.

>The fact that the network is slow means the primary use case for Bitcoin at the present moment is as a store of value.

Wrong. The *store of value* use is just *secondary*. Anything used as a store value must have some *primary* use case to get value, and only then it can become a store of value - you cannot store value in something not having a value. You seem to struggle to reveal what the primary use case for bitcoin is.

It certainly is possible to peg a stablecoin against BTC. However, similarly as the *store of value* use case, it is just a *secondary* use case.

"In pure MW as specified in the original paper, the only ""history"" is the set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set, in case you're unfamiliar with that term), so it isn't history, it is the current state of the system. The transaction contains a range proof demonstrating that the *new* UTXO that will exist in the next block belonging to L was owned by K and is less than or equal to a UTXO (or a few) in the current set owned by K. The miner cannot see amounts either, and he doesn't need to, the range proof proves to the miner that K has the money he's spending. So in your example, the miner sees 100 grins, he wouldn't. He would just see a schnorr signature with a range proof in it that demonstrates that no minting occurred.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbDZiU2JmQ2hzR3JLeHZGLVNWTS1zVDNTNl9DQTJLek5pSDlzbjc1T2FoMjhMZThlNFRDZlVvWjZWdVlyU0F0LXVKVFNObExpbnpWVzdWekE5OXdqTExwcDBxMDg3djlIQUEwdXdjOVZLS3M9

Hey Bitcoinopoly,

Sorry for the slow response. The SBF portrait could have been better. I might eventually add a painting of him to my collection, which already includes the portrait of dwdollar. Your point about having a background reflecting an exchange for dwdollar is well taken.

I have been working for several years on creating a visual representation of Bitcoin. Currently, I am focused on SHA-256. Arrays of SHA-256, representing the mining process, are the extent of my concrete representation of Bitcoin so far. While it may not perfectly match dwdollar, it is the most I can create at this time as part of the Bitcoin concept.

I am not sure what order I will be able to do more painting pieces, but the two Mt Gox exchange guys are on my list. I will probably only be able to use arrays of SHA-256 at that point in time as well.

Thanks for the response, I take the critique in mind as I move forward.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQ3pmSnEybWU2TV9WRFBkRmtiUzZGRXhjRzlHZF9EdG5RM3NfUmZtZXNDVi1FbTY0XzI5dG1mTUd4NEhQN0VCOEI0OWh2bWVVYzh6YW5lcnIyblNkakE9PQ==

"Omg dude the chains split.  If you owned Bitcoin prior to the split then you have both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. From there the miners have to choose which chain to mine.  Both chains have different transactions different difficulties. 

If what you said is true Bitcoin could never work because forks do occur time to time and miners need to pick one chain because the other chain requires different equations to be solved.  If they could mine multiple chains at no additional cost then there would be no financial incentive to focus on the longest chain.

A Blockchain each block is dependent upon the block before it.  

If what you said is true then Bitcoin cash's hash rate wouldn't be 1% of Bitcoins.  

This is why when Bitcoin cash split it took them forever to mine the next block.  Then they changed the difficulty adjustment so when they finally hit that they mined faster and got the longest chain.  That's when people with two braincells to rub together clarified that the chain with the most proof of work is the real chain.


All it would take is for a miner to stealth mine Bitcoin cash for a few weeks then completely overtake the chain. It's 1% of the Bitcoin network.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZExLbUNtNUxRbHByZy1mSG1rSGlrdmdYNUFCVHZVdlRJUmFHWkM1UEUxa0NvUkptX1FNVTRET2RiQWQzMjFaU3hRaklFT0R6bV9nbW9RaldhbUZSaUE9PQ==

"Donald Trump has been consistently critical of cryptocurrencies. In a 2021 interview with Fox Business, he described Bitcoin as a ""scam"" that undermines the U.S. dollar's importance. Trump emphasized his belief that the U.S. dollar should remain the world's dominant currency and called for stringent regulation of cryptocurrencies​ The Independent - Fox Business. His disdain for cryptocurrencies isn't new; in 2019, he tweeted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are ""not money"" and are based on ""thin air,"" adding that their unregulated nature could facilitate illegal activities​ (markets.businessinsider.com)​.

Trump's most famous campaign promises was to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it. The construction was primarily funded by U.S. taxpayers, not Mexico. Additionally, the wall remains incomplete and Steve Bannon, a former Trump advisor, was arrested and charged with fraud for his involvement in a fundraising campaign, ""We Build the Wall,"" which allegedly siphoned donations for personal use.  
  
Trump vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, D.C., by reducing corruption and the influence of special interests, but the promise was not fulfilled, pointing to various appointments and policies that benefited lobbyists and special interests. Some of Trump's associates faced legal issues, which further undermined this promise.

Trump claimed he would eliminate the national debt within eight years. The national debt actually increased significantly during his presidency, partly due to tax cuts and increased government spending.

Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to rebuild America’s roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. Despite numerous announcements and proposals, a comprehensive infrastructure plan was not passed during his term.

Trump promised to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. The size of the federal government did not significantly decrease.

Trump proposed ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S.  This promise was not pursued through legislation or executive action during his presidency.

Trump promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants within his first year in office.  


The court concluded that the Trump Foundation engaged in a ""shocking pattern of illegality"" and was essentially operated as an extension of Trump's business and political interests rather than a legitimate charitable organization.

These actions violated both state and federal laws governing charitable organizations, leading to the foundation's closure and significant penalties.

The Eric Trump Foundation, which raised money for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, was accused of redirecting funds to the Trump Organization and using charitable funds to benefit Trump family businesses.

Trump was accused of directing government and campaign funds to his properties, including Mar-a-Lago, Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., and other Trump-owned businesses. Various reports indicated that Trump’s properties earned millions of dollars from the U.S. government, foreign governments, and the Trump campaign.

Trump University, a for-profit real estate training program, was accused of defrauding students by making false claims about the courses, instructors, and potential for success. In 2016, Trump settled three lawsuits for $25 million without admitting wrongdoing. The settlement provided restitution to approximately 6,000 former students.

The Trump Organization has faced multiple investigations and allegations of tax fraud, including inflating or deflating property values to obtain favorable loan terms or tax benefits.

Trump SoHo, a hotel and condominium project, faced allegations of fraud for misrepresenting sales figures to potential buyers. In 2011, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office declined to prosecute after a settlement was reached, but buyers received refunds, and the sales tactics were scrutinized.

Trump's casinos in Atlantic City, particularly the Trump Taj Mahal, faced multiple bankruptcies and allegations of financial mismanagement and fraud.

Similar to Trump University, the Trump Institute was accused of misleading advertising and providing subpar educational content.

Numerous contractors and suppliers have sued Trump and his businesses over unpaid bills and breach of contract. Many cases were settled out of court, while others led to judgments against Trump’s businesses. These issues have been a recurring theme in his business dealings.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkVUJQS3JDYTdfaGtUNnBobWQ1eXhGTkpNdHhyelk0Xy1ieS0yTzEyWkUtaUFEcXQ3YUpFMWl3QmVEYXl2NTJoQ0M5RWduYWp0cUYwNUNxb0xtNnNUUFE9PQ==

"Does she want the BTC back or the dollar amount?

Anyway, it's bullshit. Moving it though various exchanges and wallets does cost transaction fees, but why would somebody do that? Only one move is needed, from exchange to (hardware) wallet. And now he has to send it from that wallet to her.

"I can imagine some ways he might be telling the truth. Let's break it down:

An expensive hardware wallet would typically be $100 or so if he bought it off the shelf, like a Ledger or Trezor. But maybe he built his own. You can turn any computer into a hardware wallet, and there are some paranoid people who say that's the only way to be sure you can trust the hardware: buy a brand new computer, remove the wifi, fill the ethernet and other ports with glue, and use DVDs for a fresh linux install, wallet install and blockchain download. He might account $1,000 for that new computer. Or even more if he got somebody else to do it, or got a good computer because he wants to use it for other things. Those last two options defeat the high security benefits, but maybe he's new to computer security?  It gives you questions to ask, like what brand of hardware wallet costs so much?

 Then there's the numerous transaction and exchange fees. Bitcoin transactions can easily cost $10 to send your coins to an exchange, 0,5% in exchange trading fees, 2% on the spread, and another $10 for withdrawal. Do that a hundred times and it adds up. Then it could be much worse if he was trying to buy low and sell high and got it backwards. It's an easy mistake to make. If your partner had agreed to let him trade with the crypto in the hopes of profit, then she may have accepted the risk of loss too. Or maybe he moved some of it to bad technology like Lightning, where it's easy for your entire transaction to go missing. Or maybe one or more exchanges refused to let him withdraw his money because he couldn't pass their KYC rules, and he wrote off those losses. It happens.

Sure, these costs are very high compare to an index fund or actively managed fund, but it sounds liike her ex was not a professional. If you let an amateur manage your money for you, and accept the high volatility and risks of an unbacked virtual asset class like crypto, you may experience extraordinary losses. To my mind, it depends on what the agreement was between them. Was she expecting him to just buy and hold some crypto for her? Then yeah, he's stealing to cover his losses. Or did she agree to help fund this complex venture of his, with the understanding that there would be a steep learning curve? Then she's lucky to get anything back.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkaTNuaVdKUllpWGZHYVNLLU55bkZaLWtsYnY0X01GbnNld3lrdTRkME0zTTNtXzhxdFJGQmdqaldBWGZ4ZnJMeU81Rms3ZUU0ekZ4MDk3X3M3a0swOVE9PQ==

"Don't use the BTC Core suggestion for fees.

Check https://bitcoinfees.net/ and pick a rate that will happen around what that site lists as the 6 hour rate rounded up to the next integer and it'll go through quick enough for most and still be cheap.

You could send right now at 9 sat/vB, if your transaction is 250b and BTC is $70,000 that would be a fee of 0.00002250 BTC or $1.575

last I checked $1.57 isn't anywhere near $23

If you need it to go in under an hour you can round up the integer from the 1 hour fee, call it 12 right now instead of 9.

That changes the fee from $1.57 to $2.10. Again nothing crazy high.

If somehow you just need it to be in the next block, 24 instead of 12 would probably do that, changing the fee to $4.20.

"I'm clearly not praising BSV, I'm saying that I don't trust the results of BSV as they are effectively solo-mined by the people behind it. The reason I bring up BSV is because it's, despite me not trusting it, and me not thinking it is valid, is the only known example of a comparable blockchain processing \\~10 million per day.

I'm also not saying that the block size is the bottleneck, it has arguably never been the bottleneck on BCH even back when it was 8MB. Someone filled the mempool in January 2018 with particularly large convoluted transactions with embedded anti BCH messages over days, presumably someone throwing away the BCH side of their forked BTC. It was cleared out, 8MB per block, no problem. Transactions with 1.1 or 2 sat/byte was mined straight away.

Block-size has especially not been a issue after 32MB blocks became a thing in 2018. BCH has never gotten close to having a sizable mempool or fee market.

Correct me if I am wrong, but ABLA is designed to prevent any future internal disputes in BCH about block size changes. Block size changes were part of the pretext for the BSV split, along with transaction-reordering, but I think that was just the story told at the time, because it was clear the people behind BSV wanted to control BCH through ASIC miners. ABLA itself would not actually increase the transaction capacity of BCH currently unless it was constrained by block size, which it is not.

I made a purchase yesterday with BCH, to my surprised it took 5-6 mined blocks to go through, the mempool coincidentally had \\~30MB of transactions, and they were being mined 4MB at a time, until the last block cleared out the remaining 9.7MB.

[https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BCH,2d,weight](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BCH,2d,weight)

ABLA is a antidote to potential social consensus splits about BCH block size while also being predictable and stable, but it, itself, does not increase the current practical upper limit on transactions the network can handle without issues. It will however prevent block size from being a issue in the future if and when 32MB becomes a bottleneck.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYzUzY01tTzBEZVJYSTNucE12U2t5SVFnY1FuYVBSSXBkMF90QWdTWTVEQkFIcFh2ZkdGLWVtdXZXaFVvUXFnMzI5WTMxWFpwcUM0dENKTnFJMURvOVE9PQ==

Transaction fees are only indirectly related to the security of the network. Fees are the incentive for miners to do their thing. But I would not call them security fees. The small blocksize of bitcoin sucks and I would have preferred a bigger blocksize. I agree with that. But a larger blocksize does not make a chain more secure.

"There are two key errors in your thinking. 


**Error 1**


You seem to be laboring under the misconception that the potential market size is infinite. IE you are still making the same logic error I keep calling you out on: **BCH can't succeed, or it will fail.**


That's exactly the same mentality, by the way, called out by Mike Hearn against the hijackers in his now legendary rage quit post.


Turns out there are only around 8B ppl on the planet and therefore growth perforce has to be sigmoid.


In other words, by the time BCH is the most used payment system in the world, it will have hit market saturation just like Visa has today. 


**Error 2**
You misunderstand me if you think I believe BCH can hit Visa adoption in 10 years. If I gave that impression I probably misspoke, or should clarify. 


I believe BCH can scale up to Visa scale in 10 years, technically in terms of scalability. 


I don't think it's possible for BCH or any hard-money currency to have fast global adoption because the exchange rate (BCH price) goes vertical when demand sufficiently exceeds supply.

"1) ""Market saturation"" for a world-adopted e-cash is much more than Visa is currently doing. Pretending there is a limit on how many people would want to use BCH is a common claim by the opposition. Yours is just a new ""the market has spoken"" meme in my view. BCH and BTC are already ""a success"". They are just not achieving the original dream of Bitcoin. BTC is not trying and BCH seems to want to, but can't really do it yet. I am just saying don't pretend BCH can scale up to full-world-use size yet. That keeps it from figuring out how to really do it.

2) BCH can probably already do Visa scale or close to it. That's just not the dream of Bitcoin. Once it can scale, I believe BCH could surpass Visa usage levels in 5 years or less. The vertical price growth you seem to fear is why it would go ballistic in value and adoption. The higher the price, the less of it you would need to buy something. The massive sudden adoption that unlimited price growth would create is what the banking industry (your arguments support) fear. Pretending BCH can not go viral and take over the world is their common refrain.

"It seems Vitalik was also browsing /r/btc to research this post.  So maybe he sees this thread to catch up with what the community is thinking.  If so, Vitalik you should know that most of the community discussion no longer really happens on /r/btc, for a variety of reasons things have moved on to lots of Telegram subgroups, Twitter & places like BitcoinCashResearch.

Separately to that, here was my response that I posted on Twitter:

Mid-2024 & Vitalik is thinking about The Blocksize War. Seems prompted by Hijacking Bitcoin release, but rising BCH momentum & organisation is possibly also a minor factor.

He's clearly done some digging, links to ABLA work by BitcoinCashAutist, but (seemingly) misattributes it to Bitcoin Unlimited. And criticises it on the basis it isn't ""clean & simple"", which is a little rich as the driving force behind ETH's complexity explosion. It seems he may have mistaken ABLA for the earlier proposal ""Emergent Consensus"", as there's nothing about ABLA in ""The Blocksize War"" (I believe it wasn't even proposed until post book release).

ABLA isn't that technically complicated, but more importantly it's designed to be simple from a **governance** perspective, not a technical one. Ironically, this is also part of Vitalik's case against BCH - that it struggled as a rebellious fork to gain credibility & competence through experience & stable governance. BCH actually DOES have that now - with major network upgrades shipped without contention/split in 2021, 2022, 2023 & 2024. The research he did on the ""latest"" in BCH seems to be surface level enough that it didn't get ABLA right, let alone to the meat of CHIPs, let alone CashTokens or upcoming upgrades of BCH BLISS.

We're seeing the same ""delayed reasoning"" about BCH that Eric Wall (among others) was hampered by. Despite being 6 years clear of BSV & 4 years clear of splits at all - with a metric ton of progress quietly completed to boot - mostly the crypto industry still sees BCH as the ""adjust one parameter"" infighting simpletons, more concerned with principles than results. Ironically, this is despite the work I (& others) have done to make it easier than ever to catch up to BCH's current status - but there's not enough general buzz to justify that investigation yet. With great effort it was possible to prompt Eric to take a fresh, detailed look (which significantly overhauled his perspective) - and it seems Vitalik needs the same to catch on. I don't know what will trigger that, but it's likely by 2025 or 2026 upgrade time the whispers of BCH trailblazing will have become the topic du jour.

Regardless, having a prominent voice explaining how the all-in bet on LN has failed (although supposedly big blockers are/were the incompetent ones) is great for industry narrative progress.

I would finally note that Vitalik cites Adam Back's turn from 2-4-8 MB as a case of big blockers being unwilling to compromise, when it's rather a clear case of Adam's gaslighting & rugpull that proves the opposite. Like Vitalik says, the right sees the left as naive, just as the big to small blockers.

It's great to see encouragement of everyone to read up on BCH / Blocksize War. Important lessons from the past will become more common knowledge & it will trickle into curiosity of where things are at on the less-known BCH side today.

Truth doesn't rust. And as time goes on, the world is slowly getting the message. With many delays & misconceptions & false narratives along the way - but we are knocking those down 1 by 1. This is a positive step forward for sure.  Just wait until Vitalik has reason to catch up to BCH in 2024 (or 2025/6 as the case may be).",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsbEtVSHh3WnN1TlhkTFVQbUVBT1dLU2hLZ3hsaHhENmNmeTJDa3JSTlJ6R0JPekk0aFl5MlNPRTVqblR1cTQxQl9iS05lWWs5M3NqRV9VNzNTYmJtbnc9PQ==

"He presents a really thoughtful overview- I think that there are two quotes that best sum up the situation from a macro and pragmatic perspective. 

-“Bitcoin favors maximum predictability of the cost of reading the blockchain, at the expense of the minimum possible amount of predictability of the cost of writing to the blockchain, with predictably very healthy results in the former metric and disastrous results in the latter metric. Ethereum, with its current governance model, favors medium predictability of both.” 
A quote from 2018 but essentially what we ended up with, although in pragmatic terms I believe that the predictability of reading was the right path to go down, as the e-cash idea became increasingly redundant (and yes, tons of people here will disagree, but imo Bitcoin’s best use case in the present day and age is as an SoV- and this is the broader consensus from an uptake perspective).

Of course nothing was perfect and plenty mistakes where made. But I dont think it was any worse or better than BTC. All human collaborative/community efforts are messy.

"Eth is not competing with BCH on a fee level, BCH is $0.001 per transaction, ETH seems to be a few dollars to tens of dollars, if any kind of smart contracts get developed on BCH like what we see with BCHBull , it will cannibalize ETH market share because ETH simply cant compete with BCH Layer 1.

All his talks about the negatives about BCH cant undo this simple math, BCH is a competing product to ETH.

If Visa did a review of mastercard, of course there would be some truth in it, but it would hardly be objective, since the underlying purpose would be to prop up their own product, while talking down the competition.

Edit: Its easy to criticize BCH when BTC and ETH are getting huge bucks from ETF's, making them seem like winners.

"The actual fees are the fees you pay when you make a transaction.  While it is sometimes possible to time your transactions so the fees will be lower, this is not always the case with BTC.  Indeed, if your needs are correlated with market events there is a good chance that the fees will be highest at the times when you need to make a transaction. A good example was found in December, 2017.  People wishing to sell funds held in self custody had to send them to an exchange at the worst possible time. 

However, it was worse than this, and still is.  The fees are unpredictable. There is no predictability of what fees are required to achieve timely arrival of funds.

"Wasting energy was good for US monetary policy. The US Dollar was backed by fossil fuels and geo-engineering since 1971. If you look at temperature change in the last century, when we really committed as a species to destroying the planet, there's a clear inflection point in 1971.  

There was lots of petrodollar credit available for things that consume a lot of energy because that propped up demand for oil, and the dollar in turn. 

So poorly insulated homes, giant trucks, LNG terminals, Sha256 miners (and yes AI) can all have infinite money on credit, because things that waste energy create artificial need, scarcity and dependence on US controlled energy and federal reserve system notes.

It's feasible to make a car that uses no gas and never has to be plugged in. It's feasible to build livable space that can stay warm or cool with a few solar panels. There has to be incredible FUD around those things to keep the Ken Bones of the world going into the peaker plant every day. 

The reason the US is fighting with China right now is because the fundamental linchpin of the US economy is GONE with the presence of ever cheaper solar power. Solar power is cheaper than any fossil fuel―today. California just met 100% of it's electricity needs from renewables for a month. Continuing to invest in wasteful things is getting dumber by the day.

The notes people are carrying around with the little fascist eagles on the left hand side were backed by oil.

"> Big blockers ended up paying a heavy price for their focus on opposing over building in multiple ways: even when they split off into their own chain with Bitcoin Cash, they ended up splitting in half [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash#2018_split_to_create_Bitcoin_SV) more [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ohpxes/comment/h4s5r8c/) before the community finally stabilized.

This point is wrong on two points.

1) It was not ""focus on opposing over building"" it was focus on whitepaper P2P. Big blockers (ultimately BCH) wasn't the one opposing. Satoshi wanted useful P2P cash, emphasis on transacting, not a digital piggy bank. It was and is Core that opposes the charter.

2) He's throwing shade: ""...they ended up splitting in half two more times..."". This is a feature, not a bug. You would never say ""the community finally stabilized"" about any other open source project. They all go through the same story arc. Time passes and people ultimately settle on their preferred implementation. There's no telling how long it will take, there's no guarantee it will yield the optimal version, and any project of any importance will always be more contentious.

The Bitcoin project is either open source and subject to natural fracturing, or closed source, neat, tidy and under someone's control. I emphasize BTC was opposing change, heavily restricted, all the while plotting changes without consensus and using soft-forks to avoid any sort of veto.

"> Vitalik cites Adam Back's turn from 2-4-8 MB as a case of big blockers being unwilling to compromise

It's pretty rich for u/vbuterin to say big blockers were unwilling to compromise when **we released a 2MB client called ""Bitcoin Classic"" consistent with 2-4-8 that was shot down by Adam Back.**

It's pretty rich for Vitallk to say that we were unwilling to compromise when **we literally compromised on Segwit (SW2X) and it was the small-blockers that reneged on their end of the compromise and scuttled 2X**.

Hey /u/vbuterin how 'bout you show me **ONE PLACE** where Bitcoin Core compromised with big blockers.  Just one example of a good faith effort on their part to meet big blockers halfway - a quarter of the way - even one fucking centimetre of the way (and no, suggesting ""2-4-8"" then refusing to deliver a ""2"" client and subsequently shooting down the ""2"" client that someone else delivered in good faith is the opposite of compromise.)

I could go on and on and on.  These are **historical facts very clearly and heavily documented and Vitalik knows better because Bitcoin Core refused to compromise with him too!!**. Big blockers made EVERY. POSSIBLE. EFFORT. to meet the smallblockers where they were.  Instead we were quite literally **run out of the conversation.**

In fact it was our willingness to work with smallblockers that was our political error.  Big blockers **had the momentum**.  Big blocks **had 50+% mining support compared to Segwit's 30%**.  If Gavin had pushed the change through when he still had final say over the repo -- if he had been a ""benevolent dictator"" like Vitalik or Satoshi -- this conversation wouldn't even be happening!  This sub wouldn't even exist!

But it was Gavin's - and everyone else's - sincere desire to bring the whole community into consensus.  Our willingness to compromise with good-faith common sense actions **is why we lost to the people who weren't operating in good faith.**

"> Bitcoin isn't a religion or evangelical pursuit, the world changes and technology should adapt with it. Holding onto a supposed 'purity' of whitepaper is a form of technological fascism.


Sounds like you're trying to win the argument by mischaracterizing what they said as some sort of purity argument.



It pretty clear what they mean. The Bitcoin community split in 2017 over how to scale Bitcoin. BTCs approach clearly failed while BCHs is clearly working.


So in hindsight the community just got it wrong. They should have listened to the big blockers, who have demonstrated that their ideas for scaling Bitcoin were valid, while the other guys' weren't.


So ""Bitcoin"" should be big block not small block.

"I understand his point, but as with so many convos in this sub there is zero room for any nuance. BCH may be working, but so are others (better from a TPS/TVL stand-point) so it needs to do a better job than it's doing right now in order to become a leader in the payments space (let's hope it does). 

But I disagree that Bitcoin doesn't work—I fully agree with Vitalik's readibility/writeability observation—and so in readability terms Bitcoin chose a path which ultimately had the most real world interest/uptake (ie community concensus denoted the path that the technology took as opposed to the other way around). Some of the best technology deviates from it's abstract/whitepaper over time.

So many of the debates on this sub can be traced back to a great paper that Vitalik write 5 or so years ago called 'the blockchain trilemma'— it does well to encapsulate the inability for all approaches to solve all problems/please all people—so discrete solutions to different problems need to be found.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZF8xenMybERpZGtjNUNaNDlOU29QX2kxTEw2RWd0c0Z6bXZ1aTNwSzdZUW1VdHJYcDRUa1RDMUJ3a1NncGFNNS1uUEpESy1SOEZZSUdlMkxmQVpQUXc9PQ==

"This sub is effectively unmoderated at this time, and is cruising steadily towards a date with destiny, when Reddit decides the sub is unmoderated and allows someone else to take it over.

Myself and the rest of the former mod team have stepped down following the unacceptable situation in which the owner of the sub /u/MemoryDealers allowed himself to be gamed by a scammer into firing the entire mod team and replacing it with people completely unknown to the members of this sub.

These new mods did invite the old team back, but with reduced permissions as moderators, and subject to the whims of the new top mods, who have superiority in the hierarchy.  No apology was issued to the old mods, who had done nothing wrong, and in fact were the best mods this sub has ever had in my biased opinion.

The new mods are not performing their duties in my opinion.  As of last week there were no mod discussions and as far as I can tell there's no moderation of spam or abuse.

As I understand it, Reddit has new rules: if a moderator is inactive (does not perform any moderator duties) for over a certain time period (1 month?) then through some process they can be removed.  It is my deep concern that since the new mod team is mostly derelict, there exists a very real risk that the entire team (from the sub ""owner"" on down) can be removed and replaced by whoever complains the most.  This will likely be the end of this sub as we know it.

As a matter of principle I have appreciated having Roger as the top mod / owner of the sub.  Roger is wealthy and is unlikely to sell his position for a bribe.  And since he holds strong ideas about free speech, Roger does not abuse his power to control the discussion here.  Those two things make him a very good candidate to own this sub.  The same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of us, who are not as wealthy as Roger.

I don't speak for the former mod team, but only for myself.  However I suspect the others feel the same as I do.  I'm very disappointed that Roger (instead of admitting his mistake and putting the old team back the way it was, since there were no actual problems) inserted a ""layer of management"" of unknown people above the former mod team, effectively demoting all the old mods to housekeepers and giving management to the new unknowns.  An actual apology would have been nice too.

I don't know who these new mods are.  I don't want to be subject to their whims.  The old mod team was made up of OG r/btc'ers that everyone knew.  Trust was established and maintained.  The new mods are still basically mystery people.  No bueno.

So the sub is drifting in space, effectively unmoderated, and is approaching a date with destiny when an attacker decides to formally report the sub as unmoderated and requests control over it.  At that point, everything we have done here, and **the entire history of the sub which is still searchable on reddit, will probably be deleted for good, and thus the best archive of the actual history of the blocksize war will finally be erased and replaced with a constructed narrative, and that will be the end of our history.**

"A substantial portion of TAO tokens reserved in the treasury, managed by the core team. This control potentially undermines the project's decentralization claims. Additionally, Bittensor's funding through private sales to venture capital firms introduces centralized interests, which may prioritize profit over the network’s decentralized goals. The initial token allocation, including the treasury used for investor sales, raises concerns about equitable distribution and insider influence, challenging its commitment to true decentralization.

There are also unresolved challenges, including scaling the network effectively and ensuring true decentralization through its sudo-governance model. Transitioning from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake presents security risks, and integrating diverse subnets remains complex, potentially leading to performance inconsistencies and fragmentation.

"This is the wrong attitude, but I understand it.

A bunch of people (key among them /u/MemoryDealers) wants to see the sub effectively unmoderated and we just use up/down voting to control signal/noise.

Unfortunately, this is in direct conflict with the way that Reddit expects subs to be moderated.  Reddit takes an exceptionally dim view of this ""unmoderation"" which inevitably looks like:

1. a crapton of spam posts voted to negative karma but no discussion

2. a few spam posts vote-manipulated to 50 karma but no discussion

3. a handful of discussion posts where the users are going at each other like rabid dogs on two hits of meth

A sub that looks like that -- which is where this sub is headed, fast -- is ripe for a takeover.

Reddit wants to see vibrant spam-free communities where people are discussing in good faith.  As a mod, I worked towards that goal.

**This is supposed to be the uncensored Bitcoin sub.  Uncensored doesn't mean that it's unmoderated.  It means that you can hold any opinion on Bitcoin and as long as you can discuss in good faith your content will not be removed by mods.**

That's how I (and the others on the old team) moderated the sub.

Obvious spam was removed.  Obvious vote manipulation was removed.  Hate speech, Nazi symbols, and excess aggression was removed.

Everything else was left up.

"""What is a big block' depends on who you ask.

Historically I think 'big blocks' is something at or above 8MB.

but if you ask me -

BTCs 1 to 4mb is ONE transaction for every person on earth roughly every 30 YEARS.  Thats not a small block - thats a planck block.

1MB block BTC got some attention when people saw how well it worked for  the first 100K users - people started getting onboard - famously Microsoft and Steam accepted BTC for services.

"In an inflationary debt-based fractional reserve system, everyone needs more money every year. 

In a deflationary work-based full reserve system, money is a bit harder, and everyone needs less of it.

"First, you have to understand the the majority of the population is really dumb.  So odds are good you are dumb and everyone around you is also dumb.

If you are dumb (or smart), you might want to buy BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY stock or the stock indexes and not worry about anything else.   Go about your life and don't worry about the small stuff.

If you are really smart, you should develop a software app that changes the world and stop worrying about investments.

If you are asking for advise on Bitcoin.   if you have time go spend a few hundred hours studding up on it.

Here is where to start learning with bitcoin

1> Understand what money is  (Shelling Out: The Origins of Money)

3> get a basic understanding of Keynesian economics vs Austrian economics, learn up on Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek

2> Read (Broken Money: Why Our Financial System is Failing Us and How We Can Make it Better)

3)> Bitcoin is mostly a new asset class like real estate right now.   Someday it might morph into a currency using layers or larger blocks.  Having Bitcoin act like a currency is currently not a good idea due to US tax law and being a threat to taxation power gov needs control of currency until it changes it tax laws.

After about a few thousand hours of study you will realize that money follows maslow's hierarchy of needs.   So the first thing you need to do is spend about $500 on wheat and bury a few 50 gallon plastic barrels of wheat out in the forest somewhere.    Then ignore gold and invest everything you have in Bitcoin.

Realize Bitcoin is a democracy, so occasionally people will not be happy with the direction (in the short term) and get side tracked chasing stupid Bcash.  realize Bitcoin is not strong enough (yet) to become a currency because it will get the wrath of the US gov.

These examples demonstrate how low-fee or feeless cryptocurrency networks can be exploited by bad actors to cause network congestion and degrade performance. The economic feasibility of sending numerous transactions at little to no cost makes these networks attractive targets for such attacks.

# Verge (XVG) Mining Exploits and Spam Attacks in 2018

In April and May 2018, Verge (XVG) faced significant issues due to malicious attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in its mining algorithm. Attackers were able to manipulate the network's difficulty adjustment mechanism, allowing them to mine blocks with minimal effort and flood the network with a large number of small transactions. This resulted in severe delays and bloated the blockchain with unnecessary data, making it difficult for legitimate transactions to be processed efficiently. The spam attacks highlighted the vulnerability of the network to exploitative behavior, particularly due to its low transaction fees, which made it economically feasible for attackers to execute such strategies.

# IOTA Network Congestion Issues in 2019

In early 2019, the IOTA network, known for its feeless transaction structure, experienced significant congestion due to spam transactions. The IOTA network uses a unique architecture called the Tangle, where each transaction confirms two previous transactions. This feeless nature, while innovative, made it susceptible to abuse. Malicious actors took advantage of this by generating a high volume of spam transactions, overwhelming the network and causing delays in transaction confirmation times. The congestion underscored the challenges of maintaining network integrity and performance in a feeless transaction environment when faced with deliberate attempts to clog the system.

# EOS Network Congestion in 2019

In November 2019, the EOS network, which aims to offer high scalability and low transaction fees, encountered congestion issues due to spam attacks. A gambling decentralized application (DApp) on the EOS network was targeted by an attacker who spammed it with a large number of transactions. The low fees on EOS made it cost-effective for the attacker to execute this spam attack, which led to significant network congestion. The influx of transactions caused performance degradation, affecting the user experience and transaction processing times across the network. This incident illustrated the vulnerability of low-fee networks to spam and highlighted the need for mechanisms to prevent such abuses.

# Bitcoin (BTC) Dust Spam Attack in 2015

In July 2015, the Bitcoin network experienced a dust spam attack. Attackers sent numerous tiny transactions (dust) across the network, creating a significant backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The primary goal was to bloat the blockchain and disrupt normal transaction processing. Although Bitcoin has relatively higher transaction fees compared to some other cryptocurrencies, the attackers used these small transactions to clog the network, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in handling low-value spam.

# Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Stress Test by Bad Actors in 2018

In August 2018, Bitcoin Cash was subjected to a stress test orchestrated by bad actors who flooded the network with millions of transactions. Unlike the community-driven stress test in September, this earlier event was not consensual and aimed to disrupt the network by exploiting its low transaction fees. The attack caused significant delays and showcased how easily low-fee networks could be overwhelmed by malicious spam.

# Nano Network Spam Attack in 2019

Nano, a cryptocurrency known for its feeless transactions and fast confirmation times, faced a spam attack in March 2019. An attacker flooded the network with transactions, exploiting its feeless nature to create congestion. This led to delays and performance issues, challenging the network's capacity to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.

# Stellar (XLM) Network Spam Attack in 2020

In April 2020, the Stellar network, which offers very low transaction fees, experienced a spam attack. The attacker generated numerous transactions to fill the network’s capacity, causing slowdowns and increased processing times. The low fees on the Stellar network made it inexpensive for the attacker to execute this spam campaign, affecting overall network performance.

# TRON (TRX) Network Spam Attack in 2019

In late 2019, the TRON network was targeted by a spam attack where the attacker generated a large number of small transactions to flood the network. TRON, known for its low transaction fees, became congested due to this influx of spam transactions, leading to delays and increased transaction times. This incident underscored the susceptibility of low-fee networks to spam and the challenges in maintaining smooth operation under such conditions.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYmZjQmxLTmN5cEpNNGZ2WVpmR2tqVURjeVJIOWstQk1YSGhJdVJHVkpUTEhuVEpheUotM0xfdS1YMkFnQkt3amhNWkk0Vlc1SnkxMlF5anRReGFtaVE9PQ==
"> Why can't spammers spam the blockchain once again?

In this thread you have u/lordsamadhi claiming BTC has been spammed more in the last 2 years than ever before.

Now, only one of the two can be true.

Either it's being spammed or it isn't.

I'll put forward that if the maximum block size is bigger, and the underlying infrastructure technology can handle those bigger blocks, it becomes harder to execute a spam attack because transactions are not free and miners can raise the minimum fee floor if they feel the network is under attack.

So spamming a big block network isn't as cheap as many people think. The more your network can handle, the costlier it becomes.

"When the temporary 1MB soft fork transaction limit was added in 2010, it cost about $1.5 to create a spam block and one did not need to invest in any hardware, you could use a typical computer to do it. So, without much effort, you could spam the network with 500MB blocks and discourage adoption.

Today one needs to spend close to $250,000 on electricity at about $0.05 per kWh per block, ($0.05/kWh is well below market rates), and around $1,000,000 at typical cost per kWh. In addition, to be able to make a block, one needs to have invested $100's of millions in specialized hardware.

>Why can't spammers spam the blockchain once again?

The economic incentive has changed as the network has grown and  become more valuable. Participants are incentivized to cooperate to recoup investment costs and get a return on Energy spent. It is not financial feasible to burn around $40,000,000 per day to maintain a dishonest transaction or spam block, vs about $200 per day in 2010.

It's pretty ironic to be a BCH supporter who hates government regulation, when it was the lack of regulation over money printing (specifically Tether and other dollar substitutes / counterfeits) that caused BTC to be pumped and BCH to be shorted into oblivion. If the crypto market had proper regulation, then there would be no unbacked Tether creation, and who knows what might have happened during the 2018 price war.

"The trick is to not spam the network yourself but to create incentives for others to spam the network.  One example was Proof-Of-Proof mining.  Veriblock paid pop-miners who created bitcoin transactions attesting to their blockchain with freshly minted Veriblock coins (VBK), which costs them nothing but traders were willing to pay money for them.  They were at some time responsible for 30-45 % of the transactions.  Now the coin is basically worthless and I couldn't find any recent bitcoin transaction used for veriblock attestation.

Another example are the brc-20 coins and runes.  There you can just create a token and everyone can mint it by sending transactions.  This was also quite effective in creating lots of transactions, as the tokens usually traded even higher than it cost to mint them.   Whether people doing this managed to sell their minted coins for profit is a question I could never answer.  But even a perceived profit that cannot be sustained long-term can incentivize a lot of transactions, since people just hype into the free money train without caring if they can eventually cash out.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZDZVNlQ0cWN1VkVMSzlsOWFELU9OMkZiU3dBNEdqZHZYVVE3TENmaDNxM3VDaW5lQ01TVUFEbmVkVi02ZEIyQldXdFhyUnFXa2E3UlJGVzlwcHBaclE9PQ==

"> Why can't spammers spam the blockchain once again?

They can, but it has become a lot more expensive to do so because fees are denominated in BTC, not USD.

Back when BTC was worth around $0.01 per BTC, a fee of 1 satoshi (i.e. 10^-8 BTC) per byte for a 400 byte transaction would cost a mere $0.00000007. Today, with BTC at $68,000, if you were able to get a 1 sat/byte transaction through, it would cost $0.27.

The spam that the 1 MB fix was intended to prevent was whimsical spam. We now have a strong financial counterincentive to spam, and so it's less of an issue.

Furthermore, this kind and scale of spam was a lot more concerning in 2009, when most people were connected to the internet via e.g. 1.5 Mbps ADSL, and hard drives were a few hundred gigabytes in size. Nowadays, 100 Mbps internet is commonplace and hard drives are in the multi-terabyte range, so small scale spam is a much lesser concern.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvX0lTTG9mM3dPY0s0MGNacDNwY3c4c3huTXZadkd4QTF0TkdtWDVhQlRiVXNvWWc4YUlJNkRuV3pXR2J3bEhjRWRGSkFGSHFaNU5JZTBlc1ZDOUJpUFE9PQ==

You can easily find people arguing that this isn't the case. (They may cite to you things like BSV, XEC/eCash or even other lesser known forks of what used to be Bitcoin code).

So you need to define what you mean by ""the Bitcoin protocol"".

You will find one group who likes to maintain a stranglehold on the meaning of that term (even as they alter the meaning of it), and they like to masquerade their intent by claiming that it's the ticker (BTC) which defines Bitcoin.

> Why is Core the only implementation of Bitcoin?

This isn't technically correct, as others have pointed out.

The question should perhaps be, why is Bitcoin Core such a dominant implementation (what is it - more than 97% of nodes?)?

One answer - but incomplete - is that it is really difficult for alternative implementations to gain the trust of users, since small differences in implementation can lead to big financial loss. As a first approximation, that risk is lowered if people mostly run the same implementation. Which isn't to say that bugs in a single implementation can't cause similar financial loss -- they sure can.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvXzI3ZkdKZ1pwc2xfN09ObGE0N0hJVGtqZEMwY0NNa3VlWFJST1hzaWVyWkVXT2JwUDlYZ1NZRmV6NVh4UWVobVdLa2tmYjNPTk5fT1ZzUFU2OVJvSGc9PQ==

I would say, Veriblock made a mistake by setting up on a project which was redirecting itself to be a non-scaling L1 ""settlement layer"", which Garzik himself pointed out would lead to economic consequences aka a ""Fee Event"" which logically, could have been predicted to price out Veriblock activity in the medium/long run.

Then again, the reason they did is most likely due to hashrate superiority of BTC. As this article points out in condescending terms.

"And we can expand on this answer by addressing the money quality of a crypto. Reliable expectation of functionality correlates not only to the stability of a crypto currency, but also to the restraint of its developers. Because it is the basis upon which people come to rely on the system in order to use it for value exchanges.

Setting aside the blueprint and development path, the first order of business in development is removing bugs and enhancing security. Any changes to the intentional function of the currency must be done with great care, much discussion and a patient approach. As LovelyDayHere points out, small differences in implementation can lead to big effects, including large financial losses. So every new version must be carefully vetted and on top of that you need people who understand the importance of reliability because this is people's trust and assigned value you're dealing with. Choices should be made judiciously and with a mind towards the ethical implementation of any proposed changes to intended function without burning the early adopters.

Bitcoin Core was co-opted. They circled the wagons to shut out and silence criticism, and then they allowed a crisis to become an opportunity to platform a monopolistic off-chain service called Lightning.

Because bad actors are out there and they are willing to exploit pre-existing value, there will always be this need for vigilance against deception/fraud that would harm those who hold or use a given crypto.

Generally speaking, that's why even a lousy crypto like Bitcoint Core couldn't go full nuclear and scare away all the prospective users. The goal was to latch on and paracitize the most prominent example of crypto currency. They don't want to kill the golden goose, they just want to be well positioned to maximize their takings.

Because Bitcoin Core now panders to maximalists and speculators with low information, they can lock people in with high fees and as a result this degrades the utility which was originally intended for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was meant for the entire planet to use it and be as accessible as possible. 

Bitcoin Core could have had more adoption by now and replaced banks, but you know there was a financial interest in banks preventing that from happening.

Consider two versions of Bitcoin, one with 1MB blocks and the other with 32MB blocks. Assume both blockchains have exactly the same characteristics in every other way and they're both carrying on average 0.9MB of txns.


It only takes 100KB of spam to attack the 1MB network into congestion and failure mode.


But you'd have to generate 31.1MB of spam to attack the 32MB network. 


The same is true for miners who don't pay fees. A miner who adds an additional 100KB of payload to his block in order to keep his fees high does not incur a meaningful orphan risk. 


But a miner who attaches a 31.1MB spam payload to their block is at a significant orphan risk (especially considering that their peers who can benefit from block compressions can transmit their competing blocks with only ~10KB of payload).


The more you know....",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwQzFoMUx4b1pPNHdqT01LaTBSblViMkJ0Ui0tQ25KZFFrek5UTGlMQnJUNi1ZLVJLa0htQUtLTDRXV1YxUkhEa0p2QjNfV3IyVnBRNUxoZmUtNkNlcVN2QmJqTHN4T3JweUN1aWR5d0l5Y2c9

"I did read and reply to what you actually said and I didn't make any strawman argument? You said spam's primary purpose is consuming space on the blockchain and a regular transaction's purpose is exchange of value, that's why I asked you the questions I did

None of the transactions from the first 14 months of Bitcoin's existence had value so were not exchanges of value, encoding messages into a blockchain via OP_RETURN is not an exchange of value because it's mostly a transaction sent from 1 address to another you control in the same wallet, the same as consolidations would be. But because those transactions pay a fee to miners, they become exchanges of value by exchanging their bitcoin fee to the miner that publishes their transaction onto the blockchain
          
My original reply to the main comment was to point out that a paying transaction is a paying transaction and that ""spam"" can only hinder/harm a blockchain that has a limited block size. If blocksize scales dynamically to the amount of transactions coming in, it can't prevent another person's transaction from being confirmed and it makes the blockchain more profitable to secure/mine",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2aENqaXFIeDduU1F1WklCS25zdnhYM2pOdTBoMXd2V3hSNGo5bzRLSUZBYTdKU2xjczE2VGN4QnlxaDZrNEdXRUE1elZsTV9YcDZ2VEV3MFVFTmxoeVE9PQ==

"Here are some advantages/usecases:

1. You can lock UTXOs manually to prevent AuthHead of a token to be accidentally spent or even automatically for things like Cashfusion.  
2. We show if an individual UTXO is a FT, NFT, if its mutable, immutable, if it contains a AuthHead and more through tags.  
3. If you have too many utxos, a wallet might run into issue not being able to create a transaction so you can merge few utxos to reduce the number of UTXOs that can be used in a transaction.  
4. Currently the wallet send all utxos in each transaction, if you want to specifically send out a particular amount from a specific utxo you can do that

"BTC is not meant to be used. It is meant as a speculation vehicle with no redeeming utility otherwise. Kind of like gold, if gold could not be used in jewelry and electronics and everytime you want to move your gold it costs you between $5-$300 depending on how many other people want to move their gold at the same time.

The NgU high priests will tell you to use LN to move your gold. To do so you need to slide some of your gold coins in a sealed tube from one end of the tube to the other. Then if multiple people have tubes between themselves you can make a payment network. It costs between $5-$300 to buy a tube (depending on how many people buy tubes at the same time) and seal the coins inside, to take your coins out of the tube is another $5-$300. You need multiple tubes at all times to improve chances for the system to work. Tubes will randomly break. Payments will randomly not work, because the tube transit fees exceed the value of the payment (for most small payments), there might not be enough coins in somebody elses tubes that are the only link between the sender and recepient, there might not be any link or it isinfeasible to discover the link because routing is unsolved. You need to watch the tubes at all times, because somebody could use them to cheat you, and if that happens you need to get your coins out of the tube faster than they can cheat you.

This is the path BTC has been set on when it forked off Bitcoin in 2017, and according to NgU lore/dogma, this was more responsible/reasonable than raising the blocksize limit…",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2ZlZjclhZMFJBNkVpN0ZGa3FKSGd6WndTT0huX015YngwYlMzTV92TDVNbExoNjRGQjh4NWxhU2twNVlSWnJESXlIZUl5b1RjTC1pNFJrQTBLTmh5M2c9PQ==

"I believe this is more of an issue with English than with the Bitcoin community in particular.

> The bitcoin community hates, when we talk about bitcoins.
> It´s called Bitcoin! Without adding the ""s""!

Properly speaking, it's ""Bitcoin"", capitalized, for the system, but ""bitcoin"", uncapitalized, for the currency unit. The latter can be singular or plural, just as with any other countable noun (e.g. ""I have 3 bitcoins"" or ""...3 bitcoin""; both forms are acceptable plurals, as far as I'm aware, probably due to it commonly having fractional amounts). The former is a proper noun, which is uncountable, so it's not normally used in plural.

> So what about Satoshi/Sat? Plural form is ""Sats""? If so, why??

The same rule applies: ""satoshi"" or ""sat"" is a unit, not a name, so it should not be capitalized, and it can be used in plural (in this case, the plural normally does have an ""s"", since it is usually in integer amounts). There is no equivalent of ""Bitcoin"" for it. We use ""the Bitcoin system"", not ""the Satoshi system"".",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2NTZkMmlJdlNnbkNqbGR1N3Jub2J6REUwTXRBQ09zcHY3YTBqVUxDYXNCUU4zVjlLdjE5YkMxMDV4T1hyVnNWTDNpblBMbXNUSG43S0psa2lLM3JiaUE9PQ==

"My previous work and contributions to Bitcoin Cash are well known. In addition to creating videos, I have contributed to translating various projects to help people understand Bitcoin Cash in their local language. Some of the work I have done includes:

1. Translating the Bitcoin white paper into Hausa.
2. Establishing a blog where I posted educational articles about Bitcoin Cash.
3. Translating Electron Cash into Hausa via Crowdin, a project that involved translating 15,693 words from English to Hausa.
4. Translating Unspent.cash into Hausa.

All my work focuses on educating the Hausa community about Bitcoin Cash. I hope the community will consider my efforts and support this campaign. I relaunched the campaign with the community’s advice and reduced my scope, focusing on two deliverables that aim to educate people about Bitcoin Cash.

Support my efforts to continue as I have already delivered many successful projects in the past. We have raised 5.38 BCH out of 28, and we hope the campaign will be funded before it expires in the next 12 hours.

"None of the things you're talking about involve transactions made with the **intent of consuming block space**, so clearly they are not spam.


All of the other transactions you listed, with the exception of posting messages, are exchanges of value. Even if the value was as yet indeterminable.


Posting messages is not an exchange of value, and the fact that someone paid a miner to do it doesn't magically convert content to value.


However if the intent isn't too be disruptive, then it's not spam, but just a likely-unsupported use case that ought to be discouraged. An example of this is memo.cash, which isn't spam, but just an example of someone misusing a ""P2P cash"" system as a data store. 


This idea that all transactions are perforce valid as long as they pay a miner fee needs to die in a fire and fast. That is toxic messaging that we managed to be free of when BSV split away, but seems to be coming back now that BSV is officially a failure and some of that community is returning to BCH. 


Information systems must be purpose -built if they are to succeed. Anyone who ever was on a project that died from scope creep understands this intuitively, but non-specialists may not understand.

Numerous scammers create fake promotions, counterfeit support operations, and fraudulent websites or projects on a daily basis. Keep in mind that Trust Wallet will never initiate contact with you! Be wary of any links requesting your secret phrase (12-word phrase), as they are scammers' bait.

Avoid providing any information on such websites and ensure to report them using the steps outlined in the article: How to report Scammers.

"Buying bitcoin is similar to buying a foreign currency.

There's overheads involved, which in the case of BTC are quite big.

Sending bitcoin means transferring them to someone else - i.e. paying someone in bitcoin over the internet (usually).

It sounds like the guy wants to either scam you, or get paid in BTC but not incur the overheads of converting from USD to BTC himself.

These overheads are significant, esp. if you're new to this, you may easily lose more money (not to mention time) than your BTC purchase amount.

You can lose significant money spending BTC, because of its high transaction fees. This means you'd need to budget for a higher amount than $20, but unfortunately since BTC is pretty broken, and you'd normally need to use middlemen (like centralized exchanges) to buy some, it's too hard to predict how much you'll end up spending.

Payments will randomly not work, because the tube transit fees exceed the value of the payment (for most small payments), there might not be enough coins in somebody elses tubes that are the only link between the sender and recepient, there might not be any link or it isinfeasible to discover the link because routing is unsolved. You need to watch the tubes at all times, because somebody could use them to cheat you, and if that happens you need to get your coins out of the tube faster than they can cheat you.

Not really. Miners wanted the hard fork.

Fallacy.

The amount of data that needs to be processed and stored, to achieve the same throughput and accessibility goals, remains the same.

So if there are differences, then it's because the other systems make tradeoffs.

For example, they could decrease block time significant and thereby also decrease block size, but that is a tradeoff which may scale differently.

"I pitched [an idea](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/vblm8f/comment/icb69xb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to Roger 2 years ago to zero out the churn of monthly active users of a wallet app. 

Churn is the rate at which users leave your app or ecosystem. In the case of a Bitcoin Cash wallet and the currency, there's some overlap.

I'm wasn't sure if he would get it, so I gave an example in another comment.

[That example contract](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/3N19pssAeGohPSSPqGp4CEr9sN1TchURGz) has paid the Electronic Freedom Foundation every month for the last two years. And every month, [they collect](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/12nMGd6bzC8UpyWjd9HeZESZheZ8arttAb) their payment. 

So before [unspent.cash](https://unspent.cash) was an app, the MVP already had a monthly active user to Bitcoin Cash.

Payments from that example should keep going for the next 30 years at least. 

About $7.15 was initially placed on the contract. It initially started paying out 2¢, but it now pays 10¢ monthly. It's paid out $1.21 in total and the balance is now $27.17.

***

If the value of a perpetuity is growing faster than inflation, the present value is infinite. 

If every user of an app wins and never leaves, eventually everyone remaining in the ecosystem will have picked up the idea.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3dVRadUUzVHRQMlFWQlBYVGJpSERtVWFHR0xBeWZaN0hQeTJoSlNCWnl6VUxkem82ejlFR19zT2d1d3d3U3RyTUdXVTJmcTdvV1VsSWNwemhmOHFwUnc9PQ==

">  For your transaction to be put into a block by a miner, you need to provide a sufficient fee.

You're right, that's why it's been discussed for a long time that if Bitcoin would ever be highly successful as a means of payment, the existing division into 8 decimals would need to be extended to more digits behind the decimal. This is often informally talked about as ""fractional satoshis"" (""fracsats"").

That, and the fees per transaction could still be lowered by up to 1000x before having to add extra digits.

The Bitcoin Cash hardfork happened so that we could address, among others, these issues which will need to be addressed for scaling up as a global electronic cash system. BTC is no longer interested in that use case, so it won't fix those.

"Yeah part of the Bitcoin ""wins"" argument is that anything a competitor does, Bitcoin can just take that tech and use it. But BCH can do the same, AND have bigger blocks. I guess some could argue Bitcoin could go big block in the future, but that seems unlikely. 


I heard a Solana dev say basically it doesn't matter if they have problems once in a while, because it's still way better than the traditional system, which has outages AND censorship AND ""business hours"" etc. I think a lot of people are compelled by that--they would rather have throughput with some downtime. 


I'm not sure why you think lightning doesn't scale. It's riddled with problems and is generally a pain to use, especially manually setting up your own node. It is currently pretty centralized, but you *can* always run your own node, so censorship can be evaded.

"The thing that you have to remember about the Lightening  network is that its never likely to work (LNW - Likely Never Work!) . The best case scenario is that you have many small but indeterminate payments to make so you do it through a channel, but opening and closing channels requires an on-chain BTC transaction so that its no good unless you will make 3 or many more payments, as BTC transactions are expensive and only likely to become more so.

The second thing to remember, is this is not in any sense Bitcoin, at all. Bitcoin (and many other spinoffs such as BCH) work because of the inovations and new thinking outlined in the Bitcoin White paper. Its a genuine new invention, before Bitcoin, online payment was only possible by using a trusted 3rd party such as a bank. This invention is possibly as revolutionary as, say the invention of Television, eventually, it really will affect the lives of everyone on the planet, and I believe in a good way overall. The lightning network, when it works, does not use this technology.

"And everyone that continues to buy fractions of a coin, which at some point turn to ""dust"" (when balance < trx fees) eventually creates a positive feedback loop. So although the coins still exist (not lost or burned), they can't be moved. This effectively shrinks the pool of liquidity, a form of induced artificial scarcity. The shrinking supply of coins induces greater demand driving up prices (in terms of USD). These events will create price spikes, stimulating trade action, making it further impossible to move minor wallet balances.

The system will correct itself. For example wallets will be sold by exchanging private keys for USD rather than on-chain trxs. The problem is larger balances get to exit the system first and the smallest hands last. Effectively small balances can never time the top of the market due to ~~lack~~ cost of liquidity.

Further, the block size limit creates a feast-or-famine fee rate for Miners. Rather than a steady diet of fees from transactions, Miners must speculate, running in the red while fee revenues are low, anticipating the next rush-in or rush-out market event. For example, the BTC daily fees jumped from ~$4M/day to $20M in the last 24 hours. The total number of trxs didn't change, and the value of each trx is irrelevant, only the need/demand to transact increased. This fucks with the game theory, where ""security"" is now directly proportional to trade demand and not actual use (trade volume).",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UXIycXF6cFdEbVlJY3MxeWpGb1NpZjNGTGY4SXpkakNpdnVKeHFuUHhlWFlGcnFQVHBnUEQ2RFh5OWx0YTFMaGtBb0hwYXdVVE5RMk9jR1BhdC1PT2c9PQ==

"that's exactly how shorting works

now for the worst part

on an exchange you are never trading custody of any coins.  you're just making database entries.

for example if we meet up in a park and I sell you 1 BCH for 500 dollars, in that transaction actual BCH and dollars are exchanged

when you put 500 dollars on Binance (or any exchange) your account is credited for the 500 dollars.  Binance is now free to do anything they want with the 500 dollars you gave them.  Let's say they buy BTC with it.

likewise when I put 1 BCH on Binance (or any exchange) then my account is credited with 1 BCH.  Binance is now free to do anything they want with the 1 BCH.   Let's say they buy BTC with it.

Now I sell you my 1 BCH on Binance for 500 dollars.  All that happens is that my account is debited for the 1 BCH and credited with 500 dollars, and your account is debited for 500 dollars and credited with 1 BCH.  This happens **even though your original dollars and my original BCH no longer exist.**

The problem only occurs when you try to withdraw your dollars or BCH, but Binance has turned it into BTC.  At that point, Binance will have to sell BTC for dollars or BCH at market price to give to you.  But if you never withdraw, they never have to sell their BTC, or buy the BCH.

So now let's go back to shorting.

Let's assume that Binance wants to crash the price of BCH for whatever reason.

There's nothing in the world that stops them from crediting themselves with 140K BCH (that never existed) and dumping them at market price.  It's just database entries in their database.  They can make the database say whatever they want.

"I dig that idea. Fun for foundations and forces them to check back in frequently. Streaming payments are imho one of the more fun use cases as Medium of Exchange on any crypto.

Some food for thought on this idea: 

It gets a little hairy for business value prop afaict. Industry wide avg CPA is over $35. Then each business will have different ARPU and LTV which you'd need to determine how much can a biz can give where they can stay sufficiently profitable. There is also no guarantee in prices going up, could go the other way too. 

If the business is in the self custody space, margins are pretty small so there isn't a ton of room to just pay out into a contract and pray number go up.

Then you do have to be absolutely sure that the users you target with that type of stream are actually in the cohort who will generate revenue for your business, ie someone who buys, or swaps, or provides equal value as an onboarding advocate, since there's unlikely a method to stop the payment once its begun. Otherwise you're just providing low value UBI to some potentially churned users. 

Some other streaming payment solutions I've seen/used include [https://sablier.com/](https://sablier.com/) and [https://llamapay.io/](https://llamapay.io/) - the latter actually can allow admin to stop a stream, though these are EVM.

Fun fact, the most requested currencies in app is Dogecoin. 

Whether we like it or not, speculators gonna speculate. So where should they go? To a centralized exchange where they're going to get rekt? Or play in our ecosystem where we can continue to onboard them to the p2p use case, or promote local merchants, or real use cases for crypto beyond greed? The latter is imho more friendly, but also better for business (reducing churn, more revenue, opportunity to re-activate them back to other use cases)

"Is there evidence of changing the amount?

If there is an easily reproducible issue there with BCR not picking up payments to the address that exceed the amount due, then you might have nailed the problem.

A POS app should be able to handle overpayment via several pathways:

1. Unintentional overpayment - ask if a refund of the excess amount should be initiated. Doing this will require a refund address from the customer, but in the worst case where the customer is unable to provide that immediately, they can be issued with a contact address and return code by the vendor, to process the return of excess funds. Or, alternatively, if the overpaid amount makes it feasible, then a store voucher for that amount could be offered for later redemption.

2. Intentional (tipping): accept the overpayment and if necessary and economical, and for better accounting and transparency, internally divert the excess into a tipping fund (extra transaction needed)

Businesses accepting BCH would be best off having a separate tip jar address and telling customers to tip to that instead of changing the amounts issued by POS payment protocols on their own.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cWxNdTNWQURCcWN3WU5EdG5uaU13OWtZUWQ2MGFzQS1TWUlkRDZDaGozUWZWdV9GemxxNm9QWnJTbzdyZWFGNUxqVFBFQ1RUcFhQMVlReXM2VG5ZclE9PQ==

Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) essentially have spam protection built into them through the fee incentives.

The function of the fees is clearly explained in the Bitcoin whitepaper, so people who think that fees are a bug clearly didn't bother to read that. The point of Bitcoin Cash is not to dictate fees, although there is a general belief that they should be low enough for users of the system to essentially not have to worry much about them, and that the total fees would ultimately necessitate high tx volume to pay for the network's security.

However, I can see how some people could legitimately consider that fees as implemented in Bitcoin might get in the way of cash-like usage, and they would investigate ways of putting that operating cost burden elsewhere.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UWU4b05TNzVtVnFoeW9lYWVaSWliTGZLOTlleDgzXzNUTER5R1ZUeHM1WllpX29qTUprdjVoMEZkeV84dzdTVURpdzlsSThrS3MtaTg4TzhRbXZyUnc9PQ==

"It's as easy as doing a hard-fork to change a variable once, or putting it on a schedule, or [setting up a block size algorithm](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/ebaa), **UNLESS** devs have gone in and made HFs impossible and also stipulated a permanent 1MB base limit in the process. 

BCH took the easy way. 

With the way BTC was crippled, old nodes are expected to operate as if a 1MB limit exited forever, in perpetuity. This means that even if BTC did attempt to increase the available space later, it will involve creating new special 'classes' of block space, incompatible with the old, and organizing a new complicated tier of consensus rules around that block space that only certain newer upgraded nodes would follow. 

So taproot was once such complicated tiered space block size increase, and a year later 'taproot wizards"" started exploiting the new space to store jpegs. 

So BTC can't just change the block size, and the attempts to provision a second-class extra space have caused huge security, usability and optics issues. Each soft-fork attempt to solve the problem creates a taller tower of crushing technical debt.

"It looks like someone on Binance/OKX or possibly exchanges themselves are/were short 500k-1 million BCH since $100. Every hundred dollars that BCH market price went up, the open interest on BCH increased by $100-$200m, and every move in the opposite direction the open interest decreased by the same amount as well. Even when the losses were close to 600m (600% loss), the position was not liquidated.

There are additional shorts and longs that open and close, but this 500k-1m BCH short, was stubborn and was permanently hardwired there no matter what the price went to.

In late 2022, nearly all shorts on BCH closed, but the shorts did not go under 100m open interest. The price of BCH rose to \\~$300 in  June 2023, and open interest spiked to \\~600m.

Price then went down to $200 and open interest never went below 200m, signaling the original 100m open interest since $100 was still open, since that is the equivalent of $100m open interest per $100 market price of BCH. 

On march 2nd, 2024, BCH went to $500 and we had a perfect \\~$500m open interest again. 

On march 31, 2024 BCH went to \\~$680, and open interest was a record $843m.

The fact that this position was not liquidated and instead they somehow, increased the position, to dump the price down to below $500 to save their position from cascading margin calls/insolvency, may indicate that the exchange trading desks may be the ones behind this, using FTX/Alamada/Coinflex super powers to have unlimited power on their exchanges, in order to win their bets. 

If they would have lost these bets, its possible we would have seen a coinflex/FTX 2.0 situation, where the exchange would halt all withdrawals, since they would have lost user assets to bad trades performed by the exchanges themselves.

This is just on futures, we dont have the spot data, so this could easily be much much worse.

With Binance spot wallets only having a total of 535k BCH, that alone is not enough cover their futures trading positions, if the traders were to hedge their positions to spot, in order to cash out.



Edit: This may explain why on charts we see BTC max trading volume is tens of thousands or max ~100k of BTC over some periods, while somehow BCH has ""millions"" of coins traded over the same period, despite the supply being equally scarce. And we see exchanges like Binance supposedly publishing proof of reserves for BTC, whilst intentionally removing the BCH reserves page, and still publishing ""reserves"" for lower marketcap coins. BCH has likely become a paper traded coin across multiple exchanges, and if users were to withdraw, or hedge their positions to spot and withdrew, exchanges would be missing millions of BCH, just like coinflex was.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aF9lZm5VX0E0N2NIV0dxMDZiZXVHMkJMcENQX25rQ0VjTkdWTVVIYVBNVkxMVXgxXzZjdzJFRGJSOUFBNG5relY1ZHA0eFdudlltUks3bS1feng4bFE9PQ==

"> if people could run nodes intermittently

Nodes are designed so they can be run intermittently

> 1GB blocks coming in continuously would be very centralizing

A node doesn't have to download the full block if it's already seen most or all of the transaction traffic.

It can often download a compressed version of the block which can be compressed by 95% or more.

So the question is whether 1GB every 10 minutes (*) is too much. I'd say it's not, most businesses could afford it and home users or end users mostly do not need to run a full node, but 100MB / minute is still in the ballpark for many, many home users.

> Throttling and caps are a reality for many internet users too.

"> I always assumed there was way too much randomness (or random-appearing) data in a transaction for it to be compressible.


Yes the data is extremely random **and cannot be compressed** but nodes in the netwokr have (on average) 10 mins to download all that transactions data. 1GB worth of transactions requires about 1.7MB/s which is just 1.36% of a Gigabit connection for your node to keep up.


> What is that compression you're talking about? 


The critical and centralising part (for miners & hence the network) is distributing WHICH transactions from the last 10 minutes are in its new block **to the whole network as fast as possible** (inside seconds, 6s = 1% orphan risk)



It turns out that since Bitcoin cash has [CTOR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYEZ52WVKEI) (transaction ordering) and [Xthinner](https://archive.is/TJPXA) **we can get down to 12.5bits per transaction or about 5MB for a 1GB block to transmit which *already seen* transactions are in the block**


Then there is Blocktorrent (which builds on Xthinner)


[jtoomim: My performance target with Blocktorrent is to be able to propagate a 1 GB block in about 5-10 seconds to all nodes in the network that have 100 Mbps connectivity and quad core CPUs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/afeput/xthinnerblocktorrent_development_status_update/) 


Certainly there is plenty of work to be done but even Gigabyte blocks are not so obviously off the table that one might assume at first look.




>> [u/coin-master, regarding CTOR:](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9olsze/list_of_reasons_why_ctor_pushed_by_bitmain_abc_is/e7xbhut/) **it is the foundation to completely removed the connection between the block size and the actual data that has to be transferred**. This will completely end the discussion about block size limits. As such it is in fact a prerequisite to have gigabyte and eventually terabyte blocks. **The focus can finally shift to optimize global throughput of transactions.**",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5V05VZzlTcTQ0ZU8xLWlzVUhJd05raFRrRzBvcjJVZ1k4NWtsMHVtZTFZUWJ2V3I5NE9QT2lBZ2E3cXhWX3Y0RjQ5dDQwSkV5M3FaMm5vRXlnalhWQUE9PQ==

"Wow that is completely insane. And it was done like six years ago. There are so many brilliant devs in this space! 


So this leads me to wonder how big the mempool is, since it's not compressed. Presumably an inflating mempool is a trigger for larger dynamic blocks. Nodes would need fast connections to handle the incoming transactions (and to propagate). But given the assumptions of node requirements from six years ago were moderate at that time, computers now must be more than capable, especially since demand hasn't exactly skyrocketed. Cool!

"I had a look at the Bitcoin Cash Register code (Android version) to see what it does for overpayment - which is the confirmed event in the video: the customer added a tip of several dollars onto the amount...

Good news is that there is some code which has been added to deal with under-/overpayment, but the bad news it is WIP and it might still contain bugs:

https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/Android-Merchant-App/commit/cbcde7f51bbbf51e358599390e9fb0b61ddf5e11

Also, not good is there is a code comment which seems to be from an older time which says under/overpayment are no longer relevant since BIP-70, which I hope is an assumption that's been made obsolete by the commit quoted above, but the comment was never removed and one might suspect that if other parts of the code still rely on such an assumption, then manually increasing the amount given by the payment protocol could lead to some issues.

Anyway, perhaps some more testing of the BCR will shed light on the question of whether overpayments are bugged or not.

"how would you quantify decentralization?

Are you talking about miner decentralization, or node decentralization - and if so, are you talking about nodes that validates the concensus rules, or nodes that relay data to other nodes, or nodes that archive data for historical purposes? Are you talking about nodes that comes online once, or nodes that come and go over time?

Many of these have very different decentralization impact from bandwidth, for example:

A node that downloads once, doesn't relay to others and only wants to validate the consensus rules in order to privately validate the coin emission schedule would need to download data one time, and it they had a 100mbit connection they could support roughly 7500mb blocks and still keep up with the network.

For a node that relays to other nodes and where the goal is to strengthen the distribution mechanics of the network, it might receive data once, but send the data to as much as hundreds of other participants, multiplying the outgoing bandwidth required significantly. Such a node also would need to have better bandwidth and network latency than the network average in order to meaningfully provide any benefits. If such a node is connected to, say 50 other nodes that are slower than it is, then on a 100mbit connection it would only be able to support roughly 150mb blocks.

For a node that wants to validate the full network integrity once, but otherwise doesn't care it would come online and start downloading all historical blocks. With a 100mbit connection and assuming full 150mb blocks it can only process 1080gb of data per day, which would be roughly 50 days worth of data per day.

No the fundamental flaw is in the design, the need for liquidity routing. The routing problem is unsolved and liquidity centralizes.  
The usability problems are a symptom of these underlying flaws. And every engineer knows, flaws in the planning phase are the worst, because they mean you need to go back to start and try again.

No amount of band aid and pouring money in that whole will fix this. Some people will tell you this was with intend and it is hard to argue how it wasn't. LNs path is straight to a reigned in system, not unlike any CBDCs.

"The math is pretty easy.  Block size / time between blocks = required bandwidth

So for a 1GB block and 10 minute block time, you need 1.666 MB/s or 13.33 Mbit/s.  Just over the shittiest DSL that I've seen in a while.

Let's say you are running a miner, then you connect to a mining pool.  The mining pool has nodes on fast internet and keeps up fine.  Let's say you want to run a mining pool, then it probably makes sense to get cloud or colo nodes that are on a fast link.

Things that are actually centralizing:

\\* Needing to be in some sort of in-set to be a real network participant (like anything that uses master node style things)

\\* Needing to have a bunch of funds to run a real node (lightning)

\\* Mining only effectively done with dedicated and expensive hardware (well, we have that)

"I do think there will be another hard fork. And the young/new bitcoiners, which is most at this point, will have no idea what's going on. And the ""winner"" in popular opinion will just be whichever one keeps the BTC/Bitcoin name. And that will almost certainly be the conservative one. So you're probably right.


I think CBDC is coming sooner or later, no matter what. Anything as an alternative is worth pursuing. Of course, the ideal is an alternative to *payments*-- but there's also a place for store of value. Store of value is also harder to regulate. Governments can simply ban businesses from accepting any particular payment method (BCH or BTC). 


I'm undecided about L2 being a red herring. If you include ""machine-to-machine"" in ""peer-to-peer"", then I don't think any L1 can scale sufficiently. If it's just ""human-to-human"" then probably. We've had many years of opportunity for businesses to charge usage fees but have instead implemented a simpler flat subscription model. It would make sense for Netflix, for example, to charge by the minute, but they don't. However, use-token is becoming common in AI.




Can't argue with Lightning's liquidity issue, and all the incoming improvements (channel factories) still don't adequately address it. But I see it as a trade-off. At least Lightning is still an actual wallet with Bitcoin in it (unlike ecash, which can be diluted, fractioned).

"It's not really compression because you have to download block's data one way or another, it just optimizes the dl by doing it in advance of them getting mined: by caching TXs as they're observed you save yourself from having to download the whole block again all at once and instead you can just sync the missing TXs, so your download is effectively spread across all 10 minutes or so, instead of it being 0 until a block is revealed and then having to download it in whole all at once.

However, adversary could intentionally hide TXs from public and only reveal them as part of a mined block, in an attempt to slow down others and get some mining advantage. This is why we need a blocksize limit. If it is less than about 200 MB then the adversary couldn't get enough advantage to make a difference.

Day traders act as if they can keep BCH super low indefinitely, but one day they will click sell all, and there will not be sells into their low limit offers that they use to try back in for less than they sold. Its just a matter of time.

Not to mention a BCH ETF will truly bring more liquidity than the margin traders and exchanges that manipulate the prices.

 - making personal attacks
 - suggest perfectly centralized alternatives to your decentralized proposal.
 - using sexual, violent and/or racist rhetoric.
 - habitually misrepresenting the ideas
 - gas-lighting, sea-lioning or general trolling

If ""the technical side of altcoins"" is what you're interested in, moderators, then update the scope formally and actively work towards getting such content, because it's not happening so far.

Because it's BTC in every way without the intentional crippling. People know Bitcoin, the rest (even if superior in their own ways) will have major difficulty displacing due to endless token/coin flooding.

Anyone promoting BTC today had either abandoned that vision, never introduced or adopted that vision, and only cares that people keep bidding the price up so one day they can buy dollars to actually buy services or merchandise in a centralized custodial way.

"I see. Perhaps a more meaningful concern is ""when do applications break down due to larger blocks"", as that happens far earlier than any node or miner centralization pressure.

Assuming you have or could reasonably get a hobbyist network connection, say at least 10mbit. You could on commodity hardware support downloading up to 750mb per 10 minutes of time. Assuming not all data comes at once, but also not dispersed evenly, and assuming there's significant loss, you should be able to keep up with 500mb blocks without too much issue - you might finalize validation of a new block 10-30 seconds after seeing it, and you'd have the full history and can validate all of the consensus rules, and act as an indexing service for your own SPV wallet or similar small-scale app.

**BUT**, some software that is out there **today** that supports various applications, like the fulcrum electrum protocol indexing service, doesn't handle 500mb blocks well. Last tests I read about showed that there was some friction (but not full breakdown) among some software when going to about 200mb.

This is the reason why #BitcoinCash hasn't raised the blocksize dramatically - it's simply hasn't been clear to the network participants what requirements to expect so people have been building for ""small"" blocks most of the time, knowing that BCH won't allow higher than 32mb.

With the ABLA upgrade just a month or so behind us, the block size is now dynamic and so anyone wanting to build can know with certainty that today the blocksize is ~32mb, and that a year from now it won't be larger than ~64mb. As such, they can now prepare for a ""worst-case"" that is actually quite mild (~64mb) and re-evaluate over time based on how fast the blocksizes are growing.

This lets the ecosystem keep up with the blocksize growth in a way that doesn't incur nonsenical over-night requirements of gigabyte or terabyte blocks, but still support reasonable sensible growth based on actual demand.

Meanwhile, over time, computers and networks get faster, and the cost of supporting that worst-case outcome gets smaller.

Sorry for the rant - the short answer is that your usecase might feel some centralization pressure at 500mb or so, based on the assumptions given. If you have better than 10mbit networking then it's higher.

Finally, I'll leave you with a note about why decentralization is important: it helps reduce risks associated with single points of failures. The (to me, main) reason to strive for decentralization is to ensure the network remains operational in the face of various dangers, and so it's important to be decentralized geographically, politically, culturally, technically, by host, by owner, by ... etc, etc.

You could have 10 000 nodes dispersed over the globe and feel very decentralized, but if all nodes are hosted on AWS you have a single point of failure.

You could have 10 000 nodes dispersed over the globe and feel very decentralized, but if all nodes are run by [insert cultural, political or other group here] then that is a single point of failure.

You also benefit differently from decentralization at different scales.

If there is 10 000 nodes out there, but only a single node run by a follower of a specific religion, and you add just one more node run by a follower of the same religion, then you have increased decentralization dramatically. If you instead add one node by the most common religiion your impact is much much smaller.

"Bitcoin isn't a cryptocurrency. It's ""digital gold"".

Before, the market was more international. Since the latest China ban, and more recently the ETFs, the US is the driver of speculation.

Americans pump and dump based on American viewpoints.

Bitcoin becomes a US tech stock.

US CPI is important to assess whether the narrative is *take profits because hedge against US dollar inflation has made me money in the past* **or** *go risk-on because hedge against US dollar inflation will make me money in the future*.

Of course, whatever the outcome, the only concern of the cryptobro is pump their dollar count.

Which part of, ""the USA is only one country out of 200 and it's already on the verge of losing dollar reserve currency status due to its incessant hegemonistic ambitions and actions"" don't you understand and cannot relate to the same thing happening to Bitcoin under this Donald scenario?

> Bitcoin: a global reserve currency made in USA

Oh wait, let's read the whitepaper again to understand that you'd have to sacrifice some key properties of Bitcoin to grab a hold of all its mining and limit that output to the USA. Worth it? Only Donald and others who don't understand Bitcoin or are in cahoots with its opponents (yes, those people who want CBDCs to succeed instead of Bitcoin) would agree.

It's incredibly ironic given the wailing of BTC maximalists in former years about how mining was over centralized in China, that now we have simps cheering DJT for wanting to do the same, but in the US.

If you want Bitcoin to ever be a reserve currency, you had best hope it is mined all over the world, used as an actual currency, and not centralized in the US.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1SEpQbFh5MUR2Nkl4bDNLNzAwRnZtTzhIS0F1d3pickJ6RWlTc2NWUDdGaHk4cmsyZFRaTW5BSFlEem93aHhreTdwLVcxVzZvZnJMdUl1NjFMSFBXN3c9PQ==
"Everything you just said is just flat out wrong and completely misinformed

How does making Bitcoin a reserve currency in the US have ANYTHING to do with the state of the dollar? Literally nothing lol. If the US could ""print"" BTC out of existence maybe, but there's only 2 million left to be mined and itl take over 100 years to mine it. And it won't be just the US doing it.

The above also addresses you trying to act like this somehow makes BTC ""made in the USA"". You don't seem to understand how decentralization or Bitcoin mining works. The only implications of this post would be acceptance of the biggest government on the planet finally accepting Bitcoin as a reserve currency (another term u seem to not understand). All a reserve currency is is a currency that a government has ""reserves"" of. It creates a bottom-line value factor off that.

> if you want bitcoin to every be a reserve currency


 It already is in many countries. Even the US has reserves so arguably it already is here. This statement, if it happens though, legitimizes the reserves. 

> best hope bitcoin is being mined all over the world

It IS being mined all over the world. Like wtf are you even on about. Even if the US mines every last remaining bitcoin ( over the next 100 years) they would only have 9% of it. Your post is acting like the US has the ability to just mine everyone else's BTC too haha. Once again, there is only 2m bitcoin left to be mined.

This is why moderators of the sub have had to maintain mechanisms like the automod and ""context mod"" filter.

If voting alone worked to keep the noise down and threats to its existence at bay, then the sub wouldn't need moderation at all.

Perhaps such a thing could work if Reddit made it possible for its user base to filter subs themselves for only the content they want to see. But this does not exist, and Reddit, like many other social media sites, insists on moderation and has policies and rules which are hostile to unmoderated subs (effectively enabling wanna be moderators to take control of such subs). It doesn't help that regulators in various countries are pushing penalties, even severe ones, for social media platforms that allow a vacuum of moderation.

"> Blocksize cannot be increased with a softfork.

Blocksize - and anything else can be changed - with soft forked extension blocks.

> Adding another extension block does not alleviate the 1mb legacy block congestion.

Sure it does.  I'm not talking about another witness area block.  I'm talking about a real extension block.

They can add a 100GB extension block.  They drop a single dummy transaction into the main block that says ""I validate extension block X"" and then they put whatever data they want in X, and they reject all blocks that do not contain valid extension blocks.

They explain it to the masses as a new more secure address format.  They then ensure the fees on ""new style discount transactions address format"" are low so people are encouraged to move their coins off the old blockchain and into the extension blocks.

And they tell everyone what they told them when they were pitching Segwit: it's 100% opt in, old clients continue to work fine.

They can even do fun things like increase inflation by paying an incentive only redeemable in the ""new address format.""

The only incompatibility is that coins moved to the ""new more secure discount transaction format"" can't go back to being old-format.  So in that narrow regard it's a hardfork but the user never experiences it.  BSCorons will have no problem hand-waving that incompatibility away.

"Yeah Roger wants this to be a place to have a crypto free for all discussion with basically no moderation because Roger has never bothered to actually moderate, or even read Reddit's moderation guidelines, or educate himself in any way on what Reddit considers appropriate and inappropriate moderation.

If this sub were moderated the way Roger says he wants it moderated it would probably get actioned by Reddit within a few months.

Which is why nobody should give any fucks about what Roger thinks about moderation.

Roger fucked up here, big time, and has yet to actually admit his error or apologize to this community.  In fact he sounded rather put out with the entire sub at having to even spend any time at all here, which showed me a lot about his leadership style, namely ""hold down the trigger and keep pointing the gun at things that make noise.""

Roger wants it all ways.  He wants to be the titular top mod here, performing (in my opinion) a valid and valuable community service by ensuring that the sub doesn't get sold to an actor hostile to Bitcoin peer-to-peer cash.  That in my opinion is his valid role and it should stop there.

The moment he started doing ""moderator things"" in any way then he's crossed over his role into a completely different role -- for which he is completely uninformed and has no time to actually get informed, much less do any work.  And every action he took during the few days that he ""played moderator"" here was a bad action.

Worst -- at no time did Roger *ever* consult with the old mods.  He just went ballistic without the remotest clue as to what was going on.  The sheer audacity of his action shocked me and I believe the rest of the old mod team.  And he has yet to make things right.

I wish Fireduck the best (assuming he turns out to be a legit mod and not a bad actor -- we will have to let him prove himself over time) but I'm in no way interested in helping him.

What should have been done is that the old mod team should have been put back the way it had been, with an apology, and then there would have been reconciliation.  Because lookit -- I know my old team, they would have forgiven the fuckup, if only Roger had admitted the fuckup and put things back.

The fact that Roger is unwilling / unable to do such a thing just speaks volumes about what sort of a person he is to work with.

therefore you must believe that if block size was reduced, then by making fees higher, it will become an even better store of value

> tldr; Former President Donald Trump has advocated for the centralization of Bitcoin mining in the United States, claiming it would bolster the country's energy dominance. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump emphasized the desire for all Bitcoin to be mined in the USA, suggesting it could act as a defense against central bank digital currencies and criticizing President Biden's stance on Bitcoin. Trump's comments follow his acceptance of cryptocurrency donations for his 2023 presidential campaign and meetings with executives from U.S. mining firms.

Whether something is a good store of value is easy to quantify at the individual level, but it does boil down to two things for me:

1. ""am I in loss or profit given what the market is valuing this at?""

2. ""is it liquid?""

And for the second one, high fees, uncertain ability to transact etc. definitely deteriorate the liquidity and attractiveness of an asset.

I do think it's not so easy to evaluate the ""store of value"" metric over the whole network because the data on point (1) is not generally public, although if one does control enough exchanges over a long period, one could probably get a pretty good idea of the state of things.

Since I haven't seen a satisfactory answer on those question from the BTC devs since 2015, how could I make such an assumption?

Choice snippet from the rBitcoin post:

> the past consensus was that block size limit will be increased eventually

Virtually nobody disagreed in 2015, this _was_ the consensus even among BTC developers.

Then Segwit was rolled out as a supposed necessity for LN and a quick fix to the problem of blocks already being full in 2015/2016 (manifesting the first visible fee problems and de-adoption by commerce).

Fast-forward to today:

Blocks are often full, yet increasing the block size on BTC isn't on the table anymore.

That's an ""inaction"" type of consensus change from earlier days. By the BTC developers. It needs to be stated.

"I’ve replied to that post and no one wants to check me on it so i guess I’ll reiterate. Btc is a superior sov than bch bc of the network fees. Higher network fees = bad right? Wrong. In a sense of p2p transactions yes, higher network fees are bad. In a sense of sov, a higher transaction fee inherently dissuades trading it. In other words, if it’s more expensive to trade, you are incentivized to hold it, rather than trade it. The point of store of value is to store it, not trade it. 
For example, think about a flash crash. While everyone is jumping ship from bch for a penny, btc holders get congested and fees get higher. The more people selling creates more network traffic which creates higher fees. There’s a point where people will have to stop and think, are the fees even worth liquidating right now? Should I just hold through to avoid the fees? This means less people sell which means more value stored. It’s a built in volatility mitigation system. Now look at it from a daily trading standpoint.

> talked about and hoped for for the life of bitcoin

I've been around for a bit.

The value-premise of Bitcoin is that it allows freedom from the legacy financial system - ie. a currency/SoV/payment system that is not under the control of any actor or institution.

Bitcoin has value because people believe it has the potential to *fully disintermediate the fiat-based financial sector.*. Meaning a person could earn, save, spend, and invest in Bitcoin and never touch the legacy financial system.

At least, that's what was ""talked about and hoped for"" back when I first got involved.  Go watch any Andreas Antonopolous video from prior to 2015-16.

So my question for you is: **why would a state with global hegemony over the legacy financial system embrace an invention whose fundamental mission is to disintermediate that exact financial system and render it obsolete?**",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VmVrbzJ1QlAyYzJzQVpOaHJlVkxZTmtpblpPa2tCaDF1Y1MzVU1wMFVsbUpOWDZHdS1aVm5nSHg0dW9TVDdCRlcyT3JSTjRKcmJ5VGdubGFiaHYzQXc9PQ==

"So for the first part:

> talked about and hoped for for the life of bitcoin

This is in reference to becoming a reserve asset. If Bitcoin becomes a reserve asset that means that it is becoming large enough to force governments into having to be a part of it. This is not fully  by choice, but necessity. ALL fiat systems fail. It is in their base design. So eventually we will have to shift off USD, every government and financial institution knows that is an inevitable consequence of systems like the USD. Becoming a reserve asset is a large step in that process and solidifying Bitcoin as a real value item.

There is NO world that exists where a new major currency starts dominating the globe and current powers do not get involved at a certain point. No chance. They have well more than enough wealth and power to become a force in any market. There is just no avoiding it. What Bitcoin provides is a better system that forces these governments to develop systems without ""printing their way out"" of mistakes. It also provides transparency, which prevents incidents like ""50 billion dollars on a plane went missing!!!"". Where there is power, there will always be corruption. But Bitcoin, and actually decentralized technology as a whole (via decentralized companies etc) provide a system that removes many, many layers of corruption that currently exist in our current systems (not just financial).

It will be a slow transition. This is a long-game. Many people have visions of a p2p underground currency. Others have visions of a value system that will re-define every financial system on the globe. Others just want a base-level gold standard to base new financial systems off of. I think over the next few decades, all of these uses and needs will be met. Decentralized technology is in its infancy. Being used as just a currency is such a small, small portion of the capabilities of blockchain technology. But that is for another thread.

So to circle back and TLDR your original question of why states would embrace a system that makes their current one obsolete? 
 - Fiat systems are designed to fail.
 - look at the value changes/buying power in just the last 20-30 years. it is not sustainable.
 - They have enough power and wealth to still run this new system, but they will be forced to also adjust their systems in a way to deal with more transparency and less corruption .

For OOP post: Trump saying he wants to ""mine all the bitcoin and energy etc etc"" none of that matters. He can say whatever he wants, just like anyone else. The end takeaway here for the long game is this would officially create a reserve in the US government for bitcoin, making it a reserve asset. That is a tremendous step in the global acceptance of decentralized technology as a whole. OP issue is he's just seeing ""Trump said something so i must hate it"" and bringing political bias and not being able to take an objective view. I don't care who said it, the very first step of that plan is making bitcoin a reserve, which is really the only part of it that matters.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2Y2tFZ1lSM3ZvZjJ0TThabndwSzFMM3E0MGtCY1FXcDNTYkVTa0dFTnBMaENOcmVhVXQxbndqZXZYQ3c0YV81QUdqX3FWQlZ2dFdJNzlzMzZ3NXlGb0E9PQ==

sorry to hand-wave your comment away, but it's based on this fundamental assumption, which I completely disagree with.  A fiat system that keeps inflation under control can survive indefinitely.  the US experienced a run of inflation in the past few years that was unsettling, a result of COVID stimulus finally coming home, but that's over now.

I also think that your assumptions about Bitcoin forcing governments to change is absurd.  As you yourself point out, governments reserve all kinds of things: metals, petroleum, other currencies.  None of those things have forced governments to change to become better in any way, and Bitcoin-as-a-reserve-currency is no different than yuan or gold as a reserve currency.  None whatsoever.  Just another asset to hoard.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2VDBiOE5uT2pjU0E1Mll6RUJ5Zjk1QVMxN2FFOEdkYThhdFROUDhXcHpaZnRuazFNZTFBeVN6X0VPRUNhYkFjWGZBek93cXc0cE9ydTZleGZuRmJETFE9PQ==

"I believe that it's easy to believe that BTC is a good store of value, but it doesn't prove that it's a good store of value, and I'm getting more and more interested in seeing the data propping up that widespread belief.

Because even in the simple imaginable case of the money distribution centralizing (it's hard to prove or disprove, but we can hypothesize this as there are more institutions / corporations hoovering up large amounts) and the ""tail end"" of the distribution becoming small krill with what will be eventually unmovable amounts (esp. the more of these there are, the harder to onboard to LN, which doesn't scale in number of users) ... this easily leads to a picture where for _most_ of its ""investors"", BTC might not be storing value well at all - except ""on paper"" until they try to do something with it.

Quoting u/jessquit from another thread because the historical perspective is also worth considering - esp. given how much of the old acquired supply is speculated to be lost (I guess that counts as not storing value at all :)

> Everyone wants to point to the 2018 pricewar and crash as evidence that BCH ""can't store value"". Pffft those market movements were wild speculation on all counts and now it's ancient history. Look at the last two years since the end of the pricewar speculation phase: on the whole BCH has stored value just as well as BTC.. Why? because take away the speculative movements and you discover that it has the exact same properties as BTC in every way that matters to a SOV. Literally the point of this post. So yes BCH stores value just as well as BTC and the last two years prove it -- despite the fact that it lacks all the hype and momentum of BTC.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MzVIYUhQZ0pBX3lpang0M1hxTkQtaHZjckxCLVB4anVlVUFyTE1CdU5QOUh4ai10Q3FCb1p0WUFsTHhUb2FKcTBpTXNpY1BLVDNsNmY4MU5TR0ZvMEE9PQ==

"Bitcoin as a reserve is just further legitimization. It is not the end-all be-all of acceptance, just a step. In no way will it dramatically change the entire market or anything, it is just a step that has been discussed since the creation. A milestone I guess would be a better term for it.

But to address your view on inflation. If you think the covid stimulus checks led to this level of inflation than I am not sure what to say further. In 2020 the US government blocked access to viewing how much money is being printed after people discovered the numbers they were releasing were false. This was supposed to be something that was NEVER done. The amount of money going oversees is all from the money printers. Inflation is a natural step in a fiats lifecycle and ALL fiats will fail. There is no point in history where a fiat currency has not failed. 

Maybe you can design (on paper) a perfect system, however that will not account for human corruption and temptation. Without a system that has forced transparency human greed and lust for power will eventually prevail. And even then you need systems of accountability for those forms of abuses large enough to act as a deterrent.

Inflation has been happening constantly. The buying power of USD has always been on a massive downtrend. Look at graphs from the 1900s. Look at prices of goods/services from 1920-1930.  from 1930-1940.  Hell, look at any 20 year gap and the devaluation is clear.

All fiat currencies fail.  The USD is still a ways out. A lot of the reason we are sending so much money oversees (outside of corruption and enriching themselves) is to spread the market dominance of the USD. By making more countries dependent on USD and swapping to a USD standard that will increase the demand for USD and help hedge against their inflation. The US itself will pay the price via inflation during this process, but the rich preserve their wealth in comparison to the rest of the world. This can only last so long as well. Now, I dont believe we will see a collapse of the USD in the next 30 years, but we are definintely in the end-stages of this currencies lifecycle. Inter-continental dependency will definintely buy it more time as well.

"> When bitcoin core forked btc, they chose sov, while bch chose p2p

This is a common misperception.

What happened is this:

- ""BS/Core"" group (roughly) said Bitcoin needs to be a Store of Value first, then the Medium of Exchange will follow. This narrative was later changed (post fork) to ""BTC will be a high fee settlement system, and payments will be done on L2""

- Those who wanted to increase block size in a HF said Bitcoin needs to keep growing its Medium of Exchange function in order to develop later into a Store of Value. They did not preclude the possibility that both Moe+SoV could be done on L1, as they felt Bitcoin was well scalable on L1.

Truth is, people buy BCH for their own reasons, which includes speculation. Guess that's part of the market, and part of the reason that BCH price has risen back from below $100 to > $400 . If people weren't buying it, price wouldn't be rising. I agree it's not because p2p adoption is huge right now.

Halvings have also happened before.

It seems a bit facile to put forward 'miners selling' as an explanation of BTC not pushing through its ATH so far.

"> If you think the covid stimulus checks led to this level of inflation than I am not sure what to say further

not stimulus checks.  a $2.5T gift to the largest corporations in the USA that went immediately on the books.  the corporations to whom the money was given only started to reinvest that money in the last 18-24 months when it became clear that the pandemic phase was over and people were all going back to work.  The reinvestment coupled with historically low unemployment is what caused the inflation.  Not your conspiracy theory.

> Inflation has been happening constantly

The 110 year inflation average of the USD is 3.3%.  The current inflation rate of the USD is 3.3%.  The USD can inflate at 3.3% until the end of time and it will always remain basically stable.  At least that's what 110 years of history show.

Hey buddy, here's an idea.  Post something positive about BTC that **makes sense** and see if the engagement is better.

In this sub 99% of the ""positive"" BTC posts are *very dumb news* like this or *even dumber price predictions.*. OFC it gets downvoted because it's **content-free pure puff piece propaganda.**

"33 days later… sorry but I had to comment.

The definition of the USA as a republic but not a democracy is something that I’ve only ever heard from those from the USA and (presumably) Republican voters. I’ve never heard it from non-Americans.

In general definition, Repblic refers to a system of government where the govt derives it’s authority from the people and not from God or from a monarch.

The United Kingdom, for example, is NOT a republic. It has a king. It is, however, a democracy or more precisely a ‘representative democracy’ (as distinct from a ‘direct democracy’). It is also a constitutional monarchy.

Most people who study politics (outside the US at least) would describe the USA as a democratic republic. It is also a liberal democracy.

I’m not sure if you’re just misunderstanding, but to clarify I’m referring to old/very old bottles of rare wine that may have become undrinkable. The market never finds out because the point of buying the bottle is no longer to drink it, much like the point of BTC is no longer digital cash.

It’s entirely possible for a new vintage of wine to be recognised as exceptionally good and take on ever increasing value as it becomes more rare and well known. But I think you’d struggle to find examples of wine that was initially disregarded as mediocre or bad but subsequently became prized fine wines.

I’m looking at the all time price comparison on coinmarketcap right now, and I can’t see what you’re seeing? Looks to me like BCH haemorrhaged value against BTC in 2020, gained and then lost again in 2021, and has continued to be nowhere near stable to this day. Maybe you’re looking at a better interface.

"To be fair and abundantly clear; this particular transaction was Peer (me) > to payment processor (GoCrypto) > to Peer (merchant/restaurant).

As I point out in the video; these middle-men payment processors (like GoCrypto and EllyPay) will play a crucial role in mass adoption as larger merchants simply cannot abandon fiat currency overnight. These point-of-sale systems that accept multiple forms of currency, including crypto, are serving a key role in getting users used to spending their crypto as an alternative to fiat. This is how we bolster the parallel economy that, one day, makes fiat and those that use it against us, irrelevant!

"It's a tough and multifaceted answer, but I think it's rooted in a lack of education and exposure.

Part of my goal with this video was to show that it CAN be done and it's simple to do. I'm trying to encourage others to do the same.

This is going to take time and the reality is; it may take an actual severe economic crisis before the masses rush to the lifeboat that BCH can thankfully provide. 

Crises typically precipitate real change, unfortunately. Humans are stubborn creatures of habit, but necessity is also the mother of all inventions, so it's not a matter of IF it happens, it's just a matter of when.

"BitcoinVM is to BitVM as p2p cash is to Lignthing Network.

We had something awesome. It works. It was scalable. It could be improved. But instead the BTC solution is a hat on a hat: *adding unnecessary complexity or embellishment to something that was already effective in its simplicity. This can lead to confusion or even detract from the original message.*

The Bitcoin VM has worked great for 15 years. There are lots of things that can be done with contracts on Layer 1 by enabling a few extra op_codes. But instead, BitVM goes and creates a second layer that's disconnected from the first. 

It appears as if it's intended to blockout SEO and keyword searches for BitcoinVM, and forestall or divert anyone wanting to do smart contract stuff on L1 of a UTXO chain.

Let's check back in 18 months.

"In the past analysts have observed that when margin usage of BCH went up by huge amounts within short periods, there would come a day where these margin positions would have to close (**whether voluntarily, or by exchanges insider trading, and using naked shorts against these positions to get them margin called**), which would crash the price, we saw that at  the $700 price range where we had nearly 900m USD of margin positions reported, and when these closed, it crashed the price.

Currently there are barely any margin positions, so theres not a huge amount that are paying interest and will have to close by a certain date, instead its some long term whale holders who own their coins outright, and are selling for various reasons, eg. miners are not doing too well at the moment, and rate cuts got delayed, so it may be hard to secure long term loans and funding. So some individuals may be selling to get some liquidity they urgently need.

Technology stocks seem unmoved by recent news regarding interest rates, but BCH seems to be siginificantly negatively affected. In the past we saw BCH rise to $700 when there was news that there would be interest rate cuts, and when these were delayed we saw BCH crash heavily. So it may be that BCH whales and businesses, such as the crypto mining sectors, are heavily impacted by funding rates.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2RUtYMy1vclNDVHhQZ2dRVVVROEU2ckZEVDhleWwzd2plakNwb3FZMmlrTk5FSEVrY2s4RUtNWFJ5SVBwVU1YSC1qdTJCd09oem9RVHl2MVNTRWJoc3c9PQ==

*Okay. It's not just majority rule. It's a constitutional republic and the founders set that up because they followed the biblical admonition on what a civil society is supposed to look like.*

*SMOOT: A democracy always degenerates into dictatorship, which promises government guaranteed equality and security, but it delivers nothing but poverty and serfdom for the people it robs and rules. America was founded as a constitutional republic. To safeguard the liberties of the people against the tyranny of democracy or of one man dictatorship.*

This is particularly the case in addresses where there are multiple small transactions into an address which require a large fee to process back out.. If a large company is transferring a few billion dollars, they may find 100k fee acceptable.

Sure, the rigged NYA deemed Bitcoin ""too big to split"" and gave the brand name to BTC without a hashwar and for a few years BTC outperformed BCH because obviously people are buying the brand name.  That's basically the point of the post, dude.

>All things being equal, fees will always be larger with smaller blocks. 

Absolutely not. https://cryptofees.info ethereum had and has (7 day) produced more fees than BTC. And BCH will too when the branding of BTC fades because people need an actual currency to transact and not just a gambling coin. Peter Todd is already talking about tail emission, because unlike the brainded cheerleader guys he actually sees what's coming.

There are two mechanism how fees scale: 

Maximum fee: 

Done via artificially limited supply and blind auctions. Fees are always at the maximum pain point for the user.

Minimum fee: 

Elastic supply. Miners decide at which fee they start including tx into their blocks. This is not only much more user friendly in price discovery, it also changes much slower and is not prone to sudden 100x spikes like BTCs fees are.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4Y1NYblZvZl9aRmJIdjRQX1RTWE9MbEdDTlFfaFZBX2l1d2dXM2dwN3BDNHVVOXRsakExb0RNZ2IzbzhUaWZOSlViUk9PSjV1bWdXMlFseG5sM0tsZVlLVWhOd3BiTThmUGJnTHFlLVB2VHc9

"Mining hardware is based 99.5% on Bitcoins price. Bitcoin did not perform as they expected, and after the halving its really been hurting them.

Miners have been holding and allocating 99.5% to BTC since their investment thesis is that Bitcoin would go up, which would raise the price of their hardware and also Bitcoin holdings.

Miners have been dumping BCH close to their cost price, so if the price of BCH does rise, its not the miners who will benefit since they only allocate 0.5%  (half a percent, 1/200 compared to BTC) max to BCH.

Also nearly all BCH has already been mined and likely sold off to investors since it only accounted for 0.5% (half a percent) of miner income. So even if BCH rises exponentially it wont help the miners much at all, since compared to their Bitcoin investments and expected movements that haven't panned out, it wont be enough for them to profit much.

Edit: To put this into numbers, miners bought their hardware with the expectation BTC would double after the halving, to $100k-$140k, currently its below 50% of their high expectations, so they are ""down"" $34k-74k per coin of what they expected when they bought their hardware. Even if BCH goes from $400 to $5k this would not be meaningful to the miners since they priced in much larger increases on BTC than BCH will likely achieve anytime soon. 

TLDR: For our community, movements on BCH matter since they are a percent of the current price of BCH, miners on the other hand, already calculated percent movements of Bitcoin's massively inflated price, and compared to that BCH is not even a penny on the dollar. So miners are just fked if BTC doesnt double after the halving.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDcnBOME4xZEo1V1JPUEZUOUJXMFZSRFhlOG1HcThYZkt5VU92aUxva05pT3FFd2VNZUVWTXI2QldieXFiM3VNZEhrSGp1TVNLeWEyb0hCNHo5Vkw4cnc9PQ==

Yes, this is the relative/versus price. I'm talking about the total percentage gain in the last two calendar years. BCH has outperformed BTC in % gains the last two calendar years in a row, meaning that if fiat ""NuMbER gO uP"" is what you're focused on, you would have gotten a bigger fiat return on BCH than BTC in that time frame.

You're lying. Dash is attacked way more, for far more trivial things than any other coin. You Monero morons are doing that stupid thing where you pretend that BCH and Monero are ""friendly communities"", but Monero actively shat on BCH for YEARS in r/monero, r/xmrtrader and r/cryptocurrency. Again, you're just ignorant/lying.

"Why? 

Monero has an uncapped, infinite supply

Monero had a huge scam called the cripplemine scam at the beginning of its chain which gave the devs HUGE bags

Monero has several privacy breaches and has had them since DAY 1, yet people like you continue to ""sing its praises"". This is proof that Monero is not a serious cryptocurrency, as any serious coin would find these issues troubling at the least, worthy of abandonment at most

Monero had an exit scam earlier this year where tens of thousands of dollars worth of Monero was ""hacked"" from the core team (luigi and fluffy). Fluffypony was ""supposed to have retired"" after his arrest

Oh yeah, one of the founding members of Monero, fluffypony, was arrested for stealing from his former employer (100k stolen from a cookie company). He was supposed to ""step down"" after that, but apparently still had control over the purse strings

BCH really has nothing to do with Monero, as it follows Satoshis vision which means ASICs (Monero has a really stupid ""ASIC resistance"" stance), scaling on chain, a fee market (instead of centralized fee setters), a limited supply and no scams at the start of the chain.

It is sickening that the Monero community is peopled by those with NO SCRUPLES, who constantly try to ""stick to you like glue"" so you can NEVER GET RID OF THEM and will always have to suffer their braindead narrative manipulations. The cryptocurrency community, nay, the ENTIRE WORLD will be MUCH better off when Monero is dead and gone forever.

>I see exactly zero arguments and 100 smear words in your post.

You see ""zero arguments"" because you DON'T WANT to see them. You're probably getting a paycheck just for typing these lies. 

Argument #1: Monero has an uncapped supply. In BCH we don't like that.
 
Argument #2: Monero's infamous cripplemine scam (easily googled) makes it a scammy coin.

Argument #3: Monero has had several privacy breaches over the years, with things like the OSPEAD attack making users vulnerable.

Argument #4: YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT, even though you claim to be a ""privacy advocate"".

Argument #5: Monero had an exit-scam earlier this year.

Argument #6: BCH and Monero are not aligned.

Argument #7(From another comment): You're lying. The Monero community relentlessly and ruthlessly ATTACKED Dash the most. FOR AN ENTIRE DECADE. Nobody else has gone through that.

Argument #8: Monero and BCH have nothing in common and you're constant attempts to pretend like that's not the case are creepy, weird and prove that you are not who you pretend to be.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDMHg4RnhtZjFhMFNhVS13WXhObTBDbnpZNTZxdmJFTDdUTmdJNkJKM2NUS1NmelIxbGl5YnhEVzczZi1NNTZCY3FaQWtOamlvMWRUcXZKdGlqeHFvOExweFZidG5DWFZnNnUwUGVBX21ZbWM9

Well this is not how BCHBULL works.

After the initial conctract creation, which takes under a second, the money are locked in an on-chain contract.

Neither you or the exchange can touch them (except that you can cancel early via early settlement). If anything goes wrong (network error/liquidity error), the money gets instantly refunded to your address (this usually takes way under 5 seconds for me).

BCHBULL is not an exchange and not a custodian of your money. DYI some more research.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDc1k2TzlYTWY1azBfYW1rejZMSkg5ZGctQ1hJQVZNVzUxd1Y3eE1VVTg4VVdwQ2FEcnpNMGlRRHlUc1Jfd1JVbEdfY181Z1dCTUpZR2doeHJfWmhCVDUzclpuNHZVR25FUEhjVHozWUdqUWM9

"We are developing a mesh network in Cuba to bring WiFi to areas without signal, using Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to develop the project and provide free weekly memberships.

* **Mesh Network**: A decentralized network where each node (device) connects directly to other nodes, allowing the network to cover a larger area without relying on a central internet service provider.
* **Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Memberships**: Using BCH for transactions can offer a decentralized and potentially more affordable method for handling payments and memberships.
* **Testing BCH over the Network**: By using BCH, we can explore the practicality and efficiency of peer-to-peer digital cash for everyday transactions within the network.

The fundraising efforts help subsidize and support the service. This approach enables us to offer memberships at a lower cost, making internet access more accessible for people.

  
*""35 wifi memberships cost .4 BCH, which works out to $5 per membership (daily/weekly/monthly?). So do they sell wifi as their business? Why is a business fundraising everything as if they are a charity? is it just partially subsidizing the service, so they still charge some amount for it?""*

We have designed free QR codes for weekly memberships to different nodes, allowing users to test the network for free. This also helps cover some logistical expenses for the maintenance and upgrades of the network. The network is still in its early stages as we work towards making it a sustainable project. Our focus is on developing a safe environment and providing reliable coverage and speeds for users.

Thank you for your interest in the project. While I appreciate your curiosity, some details are confidential and can't be disclosed at this time. However, I can provide you with an overview and discuss any non-sensitive aspects.

"We commit to providing a secure, private, and reliable platform for Bitcoin Cash transactions in Cuba. This commitment is vital for maintaining the integrity and independence of our network in a censorship environment, ensuring that users can perform transactions confidently and access the internet without fear of surveillance or censorship.

**TOR**: Provides anonymity and resistance to censorship, ensuring that users can access the network and conduct transactions without being monitored or blocked.

**TAILS**: Offers a secure and ephemeral operating environment, which makes the network robust against surveillance and hacking attempts. Each session leaves no trace, protecting users data and activities.

"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, and Bitcoin have an interesting connection that underscores the cryptocurrency's use as a tool for financial freedom and censorship resistance. Here’s a breakdown of this connection:

WikiLeaks and Financial Blockades: In 2010, WikiLeaks faced financial blockades from major payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, which stopped processing donations to the organization. This was a significant challenge for WikiLeaks, as it relied heavily on public donations to fund its operations.

Adoption of Bitcoin: In response to these blockades, WikiLeaks turned to Bitcoin as an alternative method for receiving donations. Bitcoin, being decentralized and censorship-resistant, allowed WikiLeaks to bypass traditional financial systems and continue receiving support from its global donor base.

Support and Publicity for Bitcoin: WikiLeaks’ adoption of Bitcoin in 2011 brought significant publicity to the cryptocurrency. Julian Assange publicly acknowledged Bitcoin’s role in helping WikiLeaks survive the financial blockade, which in turn helped raise awareness and legitimacy for Bitcoin in its early years.

Julian Assange's Statements: Assange has expressed his gratitude towards Bitcoin and its community on multiple occasions. For instance, in a 2017 tweet, he thanked the US government for forcing WikiLeaks to use Bitcoin due to the financial blockade, noting that it resulted in a substantial increase in value for the cryptocurrency.

"Blockstream was founded by some of the people who wrote most of the bitcoin codebase, including almost all of its cryptography code.  When BCH was created it copied the bitcoin code, and has continued to merge back changes to it written by those people especially in highly technical parts like cryptography.  Many (most?) other cryptocurrencies also do so.

I think you've been fed a lie which falsely accuses varrious people of being malicious. If it were true anyone informed would absolutely not want to run any code created by them-- yet the very same people spreading these claims continue to run (and copy) code written by the supposedly malicious people.  So what gives?


The most effective lies will have some truth event or fact behind them-- in this case its that there is a legitimate disagreement over the important of autonomy and decentralization in bitcoin vs transaction costs.  Some people hold the view that Bitcoin's security properties must be upheld even if it results in considerable transaction costs, because there are are ways to work around transaction costs but Bitcoin is pointless without its security properties.  Others hold the view that if Bitcoin loses its decentralization and becomes a [paypal 2.0](https://coinjournal.net/news/roger-ver-paypal-acceptable-risk-bitcoin/) that it could just get replaced with a less centralized altcoin and having the most users as fast as possible is worth any risk.

In any case, all this would no doubt be a very interesting thing to debate... but the camp with the latter view went off to create an alternative to embody some version of their views, which has thus far been a market failure (with transaction volumes a tiny fraction of a percent of Bitcoin's-- and mining entirely supported by inflation, and a number of additional schisms including BSV and eCash) and, unfortunately, many of the remaining holdouts in that camp proceeded to promote their alternative by spreading a significant number of lies about both the technology and the history rather than acknowledging the legitimate debate and defending their alternative on its own merits.

You can also see this play out in how BCH has attacked and abandoned its own.  E.g. Amaury Séchet and Jason Cox were heros of BCH and did the vast majority of the development that distinguishes BCH from Bitcoin but they're almost as hated here as the Bitcoin developers.  Similarly, Craig Wright was also once a hero here, getting standing ovations in Bitcoin Cash conferences, but these days he pretty much gets shopped out of pictures as if he were never a part of this community.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEOU5DWTRwZ0kya0h5aC1WSmkwZm5BTHBETktIdzFlWEpRRUg4NWktQUtyWFNEei1LcEtyeW5hTGZOcjJWandNdUhzdC1sVGdFLXRLdVgta1E1eWZkdlE9PQ==

This is why I said this:

Some get it in 1h some not even in 9 years. Time spent means nothing.

And you made sure you heard both sides of the story? I ask because most big Bitcoin spaces were (and still are) extremely heavy censored.

>It is an option.

It is not and once you understand why you also understand the rest. For starters, calculate how long it takes for, let's say, 80% of the population to make a single channel opening transaction. 

>Custodians are going to be part of bitcoin (and BCH if there is a future for it) whether you like it or not. Self custody is not what most people want. There is a reason people don't keep their cash hidden in their homes and instead use banks.

Kings are going to be part of democracy whether you like it or not. Voting is not what most people want. There is a reason people can judge for themselves better than a king.

You betrayed the revolution before it even began. If you want to gain anything, you go in with a bold statement: Self-custody for everyone. Then you get self custody for those who want it.

"Bitcoin, (BTC) the $60,000 coin, isn’t going anywhere. It’s here to stay as a store of value, that you don’t need to spend it all the time in little amounts.

When Bitcoin goes to 800,000 or even 20,000,000 BCH will rise with it, so in my opinion both are a good investment.

Inflation punishes smart spending and encourages stupid spending and lavish dumb lifestyle and dumb investment (because you have to spend, otherwise you lose).

Deflation on the other hand encourages smart spending and smart investment. Because you can just earn a little sitting on your money, you will only spend it when you actually need it (Not when some stupid advertisement molded your brain to create a fake need for you to spend it).

Due to this, much bigger percentage of deflationary investments will be successful investments, because the risk/profit ratio will be analyzed more scrutinely.

My opinion shouldn’t influence you investment decisions.

You should do your own research and build up your own understanding of which project has the most potential. 

In all honesty my opinion is not the mainstream in crypto community.

Now my opinion is: BTC is not sustainable, build as ponzi scheme and therefore hold no value in my eye and BCH is the project that remain closest to what Bitcoin aimed to be (a currency) therefore have a huge potential.

I believe Monero et Bitcoin Cash are both complementary project that together can revolutionise the way we exchange value in the world.

There is no main chain, BTC dont “knows” about the BCH chain and the BCH dont chain “knows” about the BTC.

This is no main chain, each nodes implementation only recognise one.


>and you know bitcoin has majority hashtags 

“hashtags” okay..

Majority cumulative proof of work is meaningless.

It doesnt tell you what is Bitcoin or not.

>but I guess you missed that part in the white paper you so like to quote.

White paper describe how proof of proof is used to resolve fork.

Forks is when two miners find a block of the same height and proof of work is used for the network as a whole to decide which block have to be orphaned.

There was no concept of separate bitcoin chain or altcoins. 

The white paper has been written years before the first altcoin was launch.

"It is a question of reversibility.

Before they added that dumbshit replace-by-fee stuff and blocks being full, a zero-conf transaction was pretty much good as gold.  It was very hard to reverse, double spend or otherwise invalidate.  So if you are vending a sandwich or a shirt or whatever, zero-conf is way more sure than a visa pre-auth.  Selling someone a car?  Maybe hang out for a block before you sign over the title.

By comparison, a visa auth could be reversed for 30 or 60 days or even longer if the customer disputes it.  A zero-conf crypto transaction is way way higher to reverse than that.

Personally, I'd put a zero-conf BCH transaction on par with a cashiers check.  Actually, I'd prefer the zero-conf.

Edit: to bring it back around to your actual question: because you don't need to wait for a transaction to be confirmed into a block to feel confidant that you actually got paid.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGRTM5T2dZYXN4aGlzaEVTaHVxWWItby1HUFNESlJRQVlJa09SM2t5UklPVl9nMHJHMnFGcDJBWlNLYjdJUHU3VFRRdjNNeWQ5aXVZaGJocjlORC1nblE9PQ==
"> Why did Satoshi call it ""p2p cash"" and then create a 10-minute block time?

As far as you are concerned as a normal consumer/user, there is no 10-minute blocktime in Bitcoin(Cash). All transactions are instant, basically.

It's just some companies / organizations are using broken technologies like BTC which makes them unable to accept reality.

> You can argue zero-conf is fine for small transactions, I guess

You say this, yet somehow you don't think it.

And ""small transactions"" is basically anything under $10000. When Bitcoin(Cash) will get more hashpower, this amount will increase further.

"Context is important. If you're an exchange accepting BCH deposits then letting your users trade and withdraw against those deposits and given the general nature of exchanges (lot of funds) then you would be wise, in my opinion to wait for a few confirmations at least.

For general day to day transactions if you are a merchant with physical goods over a certain value you may want to wait for a 1 or 2 confirmations. 

For under a certain value one (or no) confirmations would be fine in almost all circumstances. If you are a merchant and you are trading with a partner who you have done 100 trades before, then do you really need to wait for any confirmations?

What I am getting at here is that it's just risk management and the risk is way less on BCH compared to BTC due to no RBF (which is not wanted/supported/needed).

"But the mempool doesn't immediately fill blocks-- at the time you broadcast a transaction, miners are already building a block with prior transactions. 


1. Alice broadcasts the transaction
2. Vendor sees it in mempool 
3. Vendor waits 10 seconds, then delivers product to Alice. 
4. Alice broadcasts higher-fee double-spend transaction.
5. After current block is built, miners see both transactions and take the higher fee one.


Is this only because of RBF, and otherwise miners would take the first and would reject the second transaction as invalid?

"It’s a simple computing time and power usage issue. 
If you “instantly” do each individual calculation it is very inefficient for any calculating device. This leads to more power usage and less unused calculating power for each individual transaction. 
If you can balance a block of calculations in one go it saves computing power for other tasks in between, this vastly reduces energy usage and heat build up. You don’t want the time to long as it will mean the block gets full and people have to wait too long (this puts prices of transaction. Calculations up) but you don’t want the calculation empty which would increase wasted dead computing power and vastly increase the cost of power usage and heat dissipation thus putting the price for each transaction up as well.
You need a balance between each that can maximise the computer power and calculation power to make it cheap to transact yet give the computer time to break the code for the next block in the chain.

"In Bitcoin (BTC), this behaviour is now encoded by default in the majority node software used for mining, but this was not the default when satoshis write his client software.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has not only continued on the same behaviour as originally set out, but also recognized the the first-seen rule is **unenforceable** and that **miners can change their software to match behaviour they want**, and implemented double-spend proofs - such that double-spends don't relay over the network, and instead a cryptographical proof of the doublespend is relayed.

This reduces the double-spend attack vector down to only a single mechanic: miner-bribes. 

To properly manage the last one, you need one more change: an updated payment protocol where sender hands off the fully signed transaction to the receiver which the receiver broadcasts instead of the sender. Now the receiver can get a confirmation that no doublespends existed at their broadcasting node at the time of broadcast, and can get immidate notification if a doublespend gets broadcast over the network. Since the sender does not have the recipient payment information until it's time to generate and return the transaction, it becomes both financially and technically infeasable to organize a miner-bribe outcome.

EXCEPT, if they have a direct connection to the miner they intend to bribe, a prior agreement established that any transaction they submit must both be allowed to doublespend existing transactions **and** not broadcast over the network in order to prevent a doublespent proof from existing. It is not clear how this would or wouldn't implicate the miner legally given that they are signing off on known financial fraud, but I would assume they would need very large sums of money to agree to such terms, and so ""small"" transactions should be considered safe from a financial incentive perspective.

TLDR: if you're selling something second hand on craigslist, it's a waste of your time to even think about things like this, just take the money and be done with it. if your wallet doesn't complain while you're handing off the item it won't get doublespent >99.9999% of the time and you're fine.

"> There is no such thing as true randomness in a blockchain because if each node generated genuinely random numbers, they couldn't come to consensus.

Scientific / mathematical false. You can't tell me that throwing dice is not random.

Throwing dice to find out the closest match to a hash IS provably random.

PoW Mining is therefore mathematically random. 


From [your link](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/):

> Although validators add to RANDAO in each slot, the global RANDAO value is only updated once per epoch. To compute the index of the next block proposer, the RANDAO value is mixed with the slot number to give a unique value in each slot. The probability of an individual validator being selected is not simply 1/N (where N = total active validators). Instead, it is weighted by the effective ETH balance of each validator. The maximum effective balance is 32 ETH (this means that balance < 32 ETH leads to a lower weight than balance == 32 ETH, but balance > 32 ETH does not lead to higher weighting than balance == 32 ETH).

So basically this scheme does not change much. Just split your stash by 32 ETH and then you have become millions/billions of validators. This most probably already happened years ago.

But this is completely normal.

Do you have a source on that?  I've followed Satoshi for a long time and don't remember anything like that, but being honest, I'm not so familiar that I'm confident it was never said.  I just would like to read it myself, please, because I don't remember it happening.

I definitely don't feel that the cap was intended to be ""set in stone."" Satoshi did say that the cap could (and should) be raised as technology progressed sufficiently to cheaply support larger caps.

However, it seems that OP and some others feel that the current Bitcoin was changed from the original vision, and that's bad.  The opposite is true; no unchanging technology survives for very long.  Satoshi knew this, and the Bitcoin design supports change, even when the change might be for political/business reasons -- which is important regardless if we like it or not.

If a technology can't (or doesn't) adapt to the changing world and changing demands and changing political landscape, then it will be steamrolled and quickly replaced or entirely forgotten.

I couldn't care less if Cracker Barrel accepted it P2P. I was able to use a third party payment app and ONLY spent my BCH for the meal. Sure, pure P2P BCH transactions are best, but there was zero fiat involved on my part...that's all that matters to me. How Cracker Barrel chooses to get paid and what they do with it is up to them. And, no, I couldn't have done the same with BTC as the processor doesn't accept it. If I could it would have cost me exponentially more in transaction fees and taken significantly longer. 

Here...try it out yourself: https://davidhudman.com/cracker

"IMO It's really a grasping at straws. The explanation Shai gave is completely legitimate. If you follow the cut-off twitter post in that article he goes into excrutiating detail. Even if there were no way to verify, you would have to assume that there are bad actors. Yet, basically all other coins openly scam with ICOs, and people lap it up anyway. It would take an enormous amount of effort and timing to pull of such a fraud when you could simply just launch with ICO and prevent this whole thing. Pointing at a blank spot and assuming it's a fraud is overreaching.

Also, a couple of people reporting that they don't know where their funds are is not credible enough to make a whole story. People often open their Bitcoin wallets and find nothing and scratch their heads as to why. Who knows? Maybe they moved it and forgot? Maybe they had multiple wallets and only had the passphrase for one? Two people being confused is about the amount one might expect from the general distribution. Not saying it's an impossibility. I just don't think it's enough evidence to substantiate a fraud. There would have to be hundreds or thousands complaining of lost funds if this were true.

Everything surrounding the launch was done fairness in mind. One can extrapolate with reason that a ""hidden"" spot would probably be of a similar nature.

Also, the launch was completely public. The emission schedule was created so that by the time ASICs came out the majority would be mined. This is actually the fairest launch because it lowers the entry barrier to mine because all you need is a CPU.

The way I view it is Satoshi had a breakthrough and it simultaneously solved several problems. Some more obvious than others. While we ponder the amazing possibilities as currency and beyond, others simply can't and won't.

"Yes, there is no difference if one assumes that the PoW hash power and PoS stake remain constant.  

The difference, and its the big difference, is that the PoW hash power is external to the system and is potentially unbounded,  making it possible to regain control by adding new hash power.

"If you're arguing that a single PoS actor who controls 51% of total stake can take control of the network indefinitely, in the sense of guaranteeing that all future blocks on the valid chain are produced by that actor, that is also true of a single PoW actor who controls 51% of hashing power.

So, I'm assuming you're either arguing that:

 * A PoS actor with *less than* 50% of total stake can eventually gain control of all future block production, or
 * A PoW actor who controls 51% of hashing power *can't* prevent anyone else from contributing blocks to the longest (e.g. valid) chain, or
 * An PoW entity who controls 51% of hashing power exercising that control would tank the value of their coins so they won't do that, whereas a PoS entity who controls 51% of stake exercising that control would somehow *not* tank the value of their coins.

"I'll try to be objective here, because I believe OP is right even though I would not be as sensational about it.

BTC's 10 minute requirement between blocks is there because it is needed for security. If you were to lower the time between blocks, it decreases the difficulty of attacking the network. Part of why this security is needed is because of orphan blocks. When you the interval is long like 10 minutes, the rate at which there are momentary forks in the network is decreased. The ability to fork the network quickly is essentially what is needed to overpower the network. Ergo, long block intervals = more security = less forking.

So the 10-minute requirement, orphan blocks, and security are all interrelated.

The DAG protocol, specifically GhostDAG (there have been other DAG protocols but they have always had some kind of drawback that made them insecure) is a way of incorporating orphan blocks into the main network. Traditionally, this would have been seen as something silly, basically creating a situation where you're encouraging double-spending. But GhostDAG actually works through a really clever prioritisation of the graph (FWIW the original Ghost algorithm was cited in the Eth whitepaper, except adapted for PoS). This is all outlined in [their whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf), where the security of the network is also mathematically proven.

In short, in a blockchain, forks a bad. In a blockDAG, forks are good. You can think of a DAG as kind of a ""web"" with a central spine rather than a chain. Blocks can have many parents (?) and many children. You can [see it in action](https://kgi.kaspad.net/). Because forks are good in GhostDAG, the ""10 minute wait"" is actually no longer necessary at all, because the thing that made it bad originally is actually desirable.

Obviously, the blocks need to be validated and everything, and there needs to be the proof of work consensus, and so there is *a* limit depending on the network speed. But this limit is very low. Worth noting there is a protocol called DAGKnight which will remove this limit altogether, but for the time being, simply assuming a certain safe global network speed, you can push the rate up quite high.

Currently it is at 1 block per second, but soon will be 10 blocks per second. Full security comes after 10 blocks. Which means a transaction will go through in a second, and if it's a huge amount, you should probably wait 10 seconds. But essentially these transactions are near-instant. Moreover, each block can hold 300 transactions. Which allows thereotical speeds of 300 TPS for 1 BPS, or 3000 TPS for 10 BPS. When DAGKnight is released, I believe that number will go up to 30,000 TPS, because there will no longer be a need to assume a safe network latency. Compare that to BTC's limit of 6-8 TPS.

Because of this high TPS, there will no need for a bidding war. People will be able & incentivised to do smaller transactions due to the miniscule fees.

Going through the list.

1. More secure - I think quantifying security is very multifactor and a little over my head. I won't really go into this because I'm likely to get something wrong. Kaspa is just as protected against <51% attacks and double-spending and the like. I believe this is all detailed in the whitepaper.

2. Faster - as mentioned, Kaspa currenlty has 1 second confirmation times and 10s finalisation times (I think it will go down to something like 0.3s confirmation and 3s finalisation after DAGKnight)

3. Cheaper - as mentioned above, more tx/s = less $ needed per tx. Miners can process many more transactions and don't have to be picky.

4. More decentralised. Given that Kaspa will be supporting 300 blocks per second, compared to bitcoin that block rate of 1 in 10 minutes (0.0016.. bps). That's 180,000 more blocks per second in Bitcoin. This lowers to entry level for solo miners to be part of the *actual* network rather than a mining pool, which is the current situation with BTC and is a form of centralisation. This incentivises solo miners because they actually have a fair shot at hitting a block.

There's a lot more that goes into Kaspa, its philosophy is similar to BTC in terms of fair launch. Everyone could mine Kaspa with a CPU since its genesis. It was public. The team obviously mined, but there was no pre-mine or pre-allocated coins. And everyone had the chance to start at the same time.

"No distribution history since 2009 which means less people own it and less coins are changing hands endangering my potential future purchasing power

No biggest mining platform of SHA256 which means both less security and lesser economic pull of mining

It very well may be that ETH giving up on mining doomed it long-term - they got rid of important external economic signal

Miners will naturally evolve into long-term token holders, cos competent miners that will mine long-term and not immediately covering 100% into fiat would create a treasury that will smooth out boom-bust cycles natural to any economic endeavor. Thus, SHA256 mining is almost non-negotiable for me to have a big interest in some next open blockchain. Billions are invested in the industry and it will only grow from here

"""The current total supply is always known, because the current UTXO set is always known. We store a chain of headers that goes all the way to the genesis block at a rate of one header per day."" ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/kaspa/s/oWgUfutmML))

The issue is that the headers themselves are NOT verifiable all the way to the genesis block because you are missing the first 2 weeks. You have to TRUST that those headers were not manipulated somehow. Bitcoin was about REMOVING trust from the equation. 

No ""glitch"" justifies this situation. You don't have all the block history since the genesis block? You start over. Would it have been such an economic damage to start from scratch after only two weeks? I don't think so. There is only one plausible reason not to start over: we know it and you do too.

I get it, BCH and BTC have been boring lately, KASPA is doing well and you don't want to miss the gains: go for it then, who's standing between you and that buy button?

"Appreciate the effort. But I find some misconception.

>BTC's 10 minute requirement between blocks is there because it is needed for security. If you were to lower the time between blocks, it decreases the difficulty of attacking the network. Part of why this security is needed is because of orphan blocks. When you the interval is long like 10 minutes, the rate at which there are momentary forks in the network is decreased. The ability to fork the network quickly is essentially what is needed to overpower the network. Ergo, long block intervals = more security = less forking.

Blocktime has nothing to do with security ten 1min blocks would be as secure as one 10 min block. The 10 min blocktime is near the optimum between orphan rate and speed and is affected by general network speed afaik.


>In short, in a blockchain, forks a bad. In a blockDAG, forks are good. You can think of a DAG as kind of a ""web"" with a central spine rather than a chain. Blocks can have many parents (?) and many children. You can see it in action. Because forks are good in GhostDAG, the ""10 minute wait"" is actually no longer necessary at all, because the thing that made it bad originally is actually desirable.

First, this sound like A LOT of tech dept that will hit you later down the line. KISS is popular for a reason. Second. Given all things equal 10 min DAG is as secure as 10 min blocks. Security comes from the energy spent. Not from time or amount of calculations or anything else. 

>Currently it is at 1 block per second, but soon will be 10 blocks per second. Full security comes after 10 blocks. Which means a transaction will go through in a second, and if it's a huge amount, you should probably wait 10 seconds. But essentially these transactions are near-instant. Moreover, each block can hold 300 transactions. Which allows thereotical speeds of 300 TPS for 1 BPS, or 3000 TPS for 10 BPS. When DAGKnight is released, I believe that number will go up to 30,000 TPS, because there will no longer be a need to assume a safe network latency. Compare that to BTC's limit of 6-8 TPS.

Again sounds like hiccups are inevitable if network speed degrades for any reasons. Also BTC is not the competition here. BTC is crippled and doesn't perform at all. 

Compare it to BCH which just done away with the TPS limit altogether. Miners are free to mine as much tx as they preferer. BCHs speed is tested up to 1400 I believe.

And BCH has instant transactions. Yes Bitcoin can do this. it's called 0-conf and BCH made it more secure. 

So at least 1. 2. 3. are  not advantages over BCH 4. is nice and something I would wish we would pay more attention to, but you buy that benefit with a lot more tech dept and overhead.

Furthermore, it seems to make certain things unnecessarily complicated (and therefore risky) without really solving anything that hasn't already been solved in a simpler way and also been proven to be robust.

I'm also not a fan of the fact that the early transaction history has been lost (but trust me bro), that the handling of conflicting transactions is not deterministic (and thus, at least in theory, open to exploitation), that node wallets appear to commonly disagree with the canonical block explorer (but again, trust me bro), that the only type of wallet seems to be a full node, that full nodes ~~can generate~~ need to process GBs of data even with basically no transaction volume, that I see many blocks getting mined on top of themselves (single parent) even with minimal network usage, and that for some reason faster block times (and in this case stupidly fast block times - especially those being considered in future) is a solution proffered to the stated problem being solved; *""requires that all honest nodes be aware of each other’s blocks very soon after the block creation""*.

"> Part of why this security is needed is because of orphan blocks

Please re-read how Nakamoto consensus works. It's the normal operation of the consensus mechanism to get an orphan block from time to time. If they occur more often, more mining rewards (and Tx fees) are lost, which itself incentivizes miners to improve their connectivity to the network, change/modify/improve their node implementation, use a different node implementation and/or modify/optimize the size of blocks they are mining given their own specific situation.

The *""longest valid chain""* implies the possibility of multiple chains (until the shorter ones are abandoned).

On the rest of your stuff that you wrote it feels like you're not asking critical questions, perhaps? Let's see how this network does in reality when there are 100's of Tx per second.

"I'd like to hear your critical questions, if possible.

What you're saying is not contradictory with what I wrote as far as I understand. If you mine a block and it becomes orphaned, you essentially lose the reward. This is because in BTC there is a chain, and only one, as you say. You have projects like Kadena that have multiple chains but it turns out it doesn't scale well. Anyway, yes, the shorter chains are abandoned and considered orphaned.

This is a disadvantage because work was expended to create these orphans. And as optimised as you can be, orphaned blocks are inevitable.

Because GhostDAG is not a chain but a DAG, it means that orphan blocks can be incorporated into the DAG. GHOST stands for ""Greediest Heaviest Observed SubTree"". Meaning, there's a certain amount of orphans blocks you can incorporate in this algorithm in a tree-like structure. You can choose a constant, they call it *k*, which basically denotes how ""spread"" an honest tree is allowed to be. This is a simple scalar that modulates how secure you want the network to be, based on a buffer of network latency. I believe right now 18 parallel blocks (not chains) are allowed. 

Nakamoto consensus in its purest form is ""whoever did more work is right"". Having the GHOST protocol basically means the work is being measured along a subtree rather than a chain. Therefore nodes are incentivised to include as many ""orphan"" blocks in their subtree. And the blocks are scored according to how many honest parents they have.

Because orphaned blocks are allowed and actually integral to the scaling of the system, it means there are limitations on BTC that simply do not exist in Kaspa. You don't have to ""protect"" against orphans. You incorporate them and see if how they measure up to the rest of the subtree.

You don't need to create an long period between blocks to ensure the chain isn't ""taken over"" when you can actually incorporate all honest blocks into the DAG.

The security and scalability of this is mathematically proven in the whitepaper linked in my previous comment, but Shai also did a very informative [GhostDAG 101 youtube video](https://youtu.be/nhI2zo44dfc) where he goes over exactly how GhostDAG works in detail, explaining how double spending is avoided, how ranking works, how pruning works, etc. He basically goes over the basics of it, and then goes into detail about all the different kind of attacks and how GhostDAG protects against them.

But yeah, as and when. I believe this project is going to be huge in the future. It does something that no other coin so far has done, and it does it well. It has a robust mathematical backbone and also a strong community.

"> I'd like to hear your critical questions, if possible.

Sure, I'll start below. I think there's some confusion though, likely due to the fact I am no fan of BTC and am comparing Kaspa to BCH.

> This is a disadvantage because work was expended to create these orphans.

That's not a disadvantage to any user; only a miner and only once in a while. It's the cost of admission. I've mined in the past and mined a block that got orphaned. I got on with my life. Luck of the draw. But no user cared. And in the case of times it's something a miner was not doing correctly, or something else in their control, it's an incentive to do better.

> Nakamoto consensus in its purest form is ""whoever did more work is right""

In it's purest sense, this is true. But you have to share your blocks with the rest of the network so they can build upon them. Same as with Kaspa. In fact Kaspa seems to jack up this requirement by increasing the number of blocks. It's not clear to me why this is necessary. It's like the significance of number of blocks is being misunderstood or mis-represented. But.... taking a step back, this IS better than BTC, because there's no reliable 0-conf there, so any kind of conf under 10 mins is potentially seen as an improvement, I guess.

> You don't need to create an long period between blocks to ensure the chain isn't ""taken over"" 

How is the chain taken over if the block times are shorter? The longer block time is just to make mining as fair as possible, within the constraints of the system. On BCH it's not even that important due to CTOR.

> The security and scalability of this is mathematically proven in the whitepaper 

I'm not a super math guy - so I cannot confirm, nor deny, but I did not see rebuttals to the papers that seem to disagree with this assessment.

You may be right about the project being sound, but even if it is sound, it's not solving any problem that BCH hasn't already solved in a simpler and less risky way.

If I can get motivated enough, I will try to read and digest more, but it's not passing my initial filter at this stage as something more than a curiosity.

Sorry about your loss lol! But sure, to the user, an orphaned block makes no difference in a blockchain. Since there will still be a block every ~10 min. But when the network doesn't need to reject them in the first place, you don't need to space out the block confirmations to avoid forks. This in turn speeds up transactions, lower costs, etc. All of which affect the user. Which is the central point of Kaspa.

> But you have to share your blocks with the rest of the network so they can build upon them. Same as with Kaspa. In fact Kaspa seems to jack up this requirement by increasing the number of blocks. It's not clear to me why this is necessary.

Having fast blocks alongside GhostDAG allows for extremely fast finalisation times. So for right now (which is the network running in slow mode), it's 1-second for a block confirmation. This means you press send and then wait a second and the Kaspa appears in the receipient's account. For sensitive transactions, 10 blocks worth of confirmations means that the transaction has reached a point where it is virtually impossible to be rejected from the network. My understanding is this might be equivalent to 2-4 block confirmations in BTC.

This means 10 second finalisation times, as well as ridiculously low fees. But for a cup of coffee, you can get away with 1 or 2 seconds. I don't think anybody would attempt a 51% attack for a cup of coffee haha. Still, it's just as fast as tapping your VISA card.

As I understand it, and AFAIK BCH is BTC with a higher block size and therefore low TX fees because there's no bidding war ? Big advantage. But you still require minimum on average several minute confirmation times? And how many blocks for finalisation? Same as BTC I assume?

> How is the chain taken over if the block times are shorter? The longer block time is just to make mining as fair as possible, within the constraints of the system. On BCH it's not even that important due to CTOR.

I'm not sure what CTOR is, but the 10 minute block time for BTC (and I assume BCH?) ensures a block is properly propagated throughout the network. If you lower that number, then more forks are created more quickly, increasing the chance of a double spend. You're having to reject shorter chains left and right. Having 10-minute interval ensures ample room to minimise orphans and therefore reduce the likelihood of double spends - e.g. confirmations, blocks or chains that then get rejected.

With BTC (and I assume BCH), the shorter the interval, the more likely it is for a transaction with x confirmations to be reversed.

Because Kaspa allows orphans, it converts this ""limitation"" into a ""feature"". More forks = more transactions per second. Forks are incorporated into the tree.

> You may be right about the project being sound, but even if it is sound, it's not solving any problem that BCH hasn't already solved in a simpler and less risky way.

You have a point that Kaspa is more complex than BTC (and again I assume BCH). But keep in mind nearly a decade of research has gone into GhostDAG. Shai is a PhD in quantum cryptography, and Yonathan is postdoc. Zohar is also someone smart but I don't see his face often. These people have poured a good part of their lives into this project. The fact that they have a mathematical proof for its security for me is pretty big.

The main advantage I see that Kaspa has over BCH I suppose would be the near-instant confirmation times, as well as the scalability to thousands of transactions per second.

 If you only hang around 25 year olds you might get a different view, but I’m confident 75% of Canadians where I am from think crypto is an absolute joke because open scams are running 100B dollar organizations, and they are right.

 People who hold keys outside of a broker think this doesn’t effect them but certainly regular people need an intermediary to acquire bitcoin and that is not something currently provided that you can say for certain isn’t a scam.

 Because back in 2020 when I lost my money, Siri on your iPhone would have said not a scam, trust pilot and millions of user reviews said not a scam, basically if you did your due diligence in 2020 you would have reached the conclusion binance is probably the safest then they turned around and scammed millions in one big swoop, certainly makes the crypto community look like a joke, whether you can admit it or not.

BCH already has 0-conf. I do 5 figure USD sum transactions - accepted and treated as final within a second or two.

I didn't calculate the max Tx rate of BCH, but with ALBA, it's virtually unbounded. Let's at least put it in the same ballpark as what Kaspa claims it can do.

The thing is BCH meets both these criteria without all the extra hoop jumping.

"Looks like massive shorts on Binance since the MTGox news, the issue will be if they sold more coins than will even be released from MTGox, they will have to buy back to close, and if they know they are fked, they will try mine all new coins instead of buying to raise the price.

Mining hashrate changes would occur, if it is miners who manipulate BCH prices, so they will own miners they can use for covering their shorts by mining new BCH coins, regular short sellers do not own mining machines. So this would be more evidence that BTC miners actively price manipulate crypto markets.

Miners usually use massive loans against their equipment to get large amounts of money, if it turns out they then use this money on casino plays, those lending dollars to these sectors will eventually all be fked.

"No rush. What dev industry do you work in if I may enquire?

I looked more into the mechanism of BCH's 0-conf. It seems as though it keeps it stored in the mempool and treats the mempool as ""it'll be confirmed because it can't really be overwritten"" kind of assumption. Which works because there's no RBFs.

Just FWIW even if a most merchants would treat this as final, 0-conf is far from final. Finality is achieved when the chance of there being an attack is essentially negligible, that there is for all intents and purposes zero risk of double spend attack.

I get how block confirmations are more important for BTC than in BCH because of RBF, but relying only on the mempool is prone to double spending as well and even though the risk is low its still there. There is a compromise. Fine for coffees, but I am reading that for bigger purchases people people tend to wait for several confirmations in BCH. Which makes sense.

For big purchases in Kaspa you would only need to wait 10 seconds to reach the same level of certainty as several confirmations from BTC/BCH for big purchases. At this point, the transaction is fully confirmed and deeply integrated into the DAG. Just in the same way after an hour or so the transaction is integrated into the blockchain for BTC/BCH.

From my biased eyes, it would seem that although the underlying algorithm Kaspa uses is more complex, it doesn't require workarounds. You don't need to add a feature or create some workaround to make up for something that's desirable, or make have to make the smallest compromise here and there. You get fully secure, cheap, instant, scalable and decentralised fully into the base layer 1 consensus mechanism. You get the security of block confirmations without compromising on speed. I think that's the selling point of Kaspa: no compromises. 

Also, what's ALBA? I tried searching for it but couldn't find it.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNUThhdHVpc2dRTld6bTc4NW5EOGprSENKRHhjNmp5U0tpQjZyNkw3UjBpWXRmSU9VS0diMHNiSW9LNGxxOFdpUzhPUURuNzZSOC1hdUZQNmFjZUFtYkE9PQ==
"> What dev industry do you work in if I may enquire?

NASDAQ listed multi-national - engineering domain.

> Finality is achieved when the chance of there being an attack is essentially negligible...

For practical purposes under normal operation it is on BCH; for academic definitions, perhaps not.

> Fine for coffees, but I am reading that for bigger purchases people people tend to wait for several confirmations in BCH.

You make your own judgement call - there are recent threads (and some not so recent) on 0-conf in this group. I must have done a thousand 0-conf transactions by now. Never ran into an issue. In terms of practice it's not a problem that really needs more attention for BCH.

> For big purchases in Kaspa you would only need to wait 10 seconds to reach the same level of certainty as several confirmations from BTC/BCH for big purchases.

My intuition is to reject/debate that assertion since the PoW that goes into several confirmations on BCH (and definitely BTC) is likely significantly larger, but given the different hash algorithms maybe that is comparing apples to oranges.

Conceptually a ""confirmation"" on a short time frame block chain is not really any different to knowing you broadcast your Tx to miners on an honest network with ample block space. Really only a double spend can cause problems and if I am making the Tx I know I won't do that, and merchants/services can use double spend proofs.

> From my biased eyes, it would seem that although the underlying algorithm Kaspa uses is more complex, it doesn't require workarounds.

From my biased eyes (!!) I see the heuristics that Kaspa uses to sort out the DAG and conflicting Txs as conceptually the same thing as CTOR and other improvements on BCH. The end goals are the same. It's just that from my perspective BCH does this on a time tested and proven distributed consensus mechanism. I don't see Kaspa as having negotiated that baptism of fire, yet. The white paper my contain proofs, but I'm too dumb to believe the claims without seeing it for myself (also noting the significant financial incentives that are linked to it).

> ALBA

It's live now; it's an adaptive block size limit. Maximum block size is no longer fixed. Tx volume is no longer fixed.

By the way this is not my full reply - I am just still awake and lurking.

Just curious, have you ever heard of Digibyte? (DGB). PoW block chain with 15 second blocks. It more or less embodies some of the goals of Kaspa without the DAG and associated changes to consensus.

"This is something that is a bit over my head, but it's to do with the technology of GhostDAG. I remember Shai explaining briefly when someone asked about transaction speed and block rate that there are reasons why it makes sense to increase block rate for GhostDAG instead of increasing block size to allow more transactions. Actually, he mentioned that even if you keep TPS the same, there are reasons why it makes sense to increase block confirmation rates.

That aside, lets say you buy a coffee for 20 KAS. The moment you press send, that hits some nodes in the mempool. Lets say a local node takes about 10-20 ms, and propagates through the network in a few more jumps. Now a miner has to mine it. If they can mine it in 100ms instead of 1000ms (I know its a little more complex than that but lets not get into too much detail), and then the nodes do a return trip of a few 10-20ms jumps back to the merchant, that would save almost a whole second whether you're doing 10 BPS or 1 BPS, and you get finalisation even faster. The travelling latency is the same but the block confirmation is faster, and so the entire transaction is faster.

The real question is about pushing 100 BPS, which is part of the roadmap. Again, there is probably a really good reason that's technical and beyond me. I reckon it might have something to with the fact that unlike a blockchain, more blocks = more security. So if in the first second you have a few blocks in parallel that get confirmed, then the next second you have a slew of other blocks that have a tree-like dependency on the previous second blocks. The strength or validity of a block depends on how many other blocks point to it. I'm not describing well what I'm seeing visually, but I think the overall point is that having a higher BPS actually decreases finalisation times. Don't quote me on that though. BlockDAG dynamics are very different from blockchains.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOb1o2S3pNVW5ZZVAxSlh0aDRtaWRwd3hCTk1zeDRqYUJFelktNWhMMFJ3S2RFUmRTZ2ZUZ1hqbTVOM24xYjJwTVp6UzB0ZTJCUVB1Z1dYVWlVYlVrTEE9PQ==

"The market trades on future news, trying to anticipate, and almost always overreacting. This causes the price to oscillate around the ""real"" price.  Point being, the selling from Mt. Gox/US/Germany doesn't need to start before the price goes down, because traders already have the information that it's going to happen.  This is what people mean when they say ""priced in"".  Using TA with good indicators on the right time frame can help you to identify the limits of these oscillations.  For instance, the weekly RSI in the beginning of march was over 90 (!!!), indicating a severe overbought market condition.  From there, we need to go back and test 50 RSI (which we just dipped below), to make sure we are still in a bull market.  Other patterns people have noticed are a bull flag, inverse head and shoulders, and now our Stochastic RSI is bottoming out and looks like it might cross to give us upward momentum next week.

"I share your sentiment to a degree, Satoshi f'ed up to some degree, he let it all go to shit.

Bitcoin has lost an opportunity, it's largely issued (94% in fact), issued coins now impede grassroots / low-risk distribution, and that impedes adoption.

IE. The **distribution of the existing coins is now a zero-sum game.** Making Bitcoin more like a Ponzi, rewarding those who got in early at the existence of those who joined the network late.

The new competitors that may be up for the challenge of P2P digital cash are drowned in a sea of noise.

That said, Bitcoin is one player in an infinite game where players come and go, **the rules are changeable, and there is no defined endpoint,** so I'm not qualified to judge or make a call.

On the idea of bankers gaining control, one can't control nature. Reality is the ultimate winner. When an idea's time has come it will be unstoppable, what drives the awakening to the idea is reality seen through the lens of past mistakes.

"In 2017 BTC forked from Bitcoin to become a purely speculative asset with no utility. Purely speculative assets are very volatile, because they do not have utility driven demand, their sole&only basis for valuation is speculation of future bagholder sentiment.

Unfortunately, this has set the tone for crypto as a whole. There are some (very few) projects such as BCH that attempt to get out of this ditch. However, they have been attacked by BTC and it is sn uphill battle against public perception of crypto as speculative trash (that BTC created),

This latest round of volatility (down in this case) is the direct result of BTCs flawed ideology. As long as BTC remains, all of crypto is stuck in speculative hell and high volatility with no significant real-world adoption happening. BTC needs to go, before crypto has any chance to change the world.

This is what happens when the establishment subverts a movement that threatens the status quo, and makes it into a movement to shore up the status quo.

BTC (an unusable, feature poor and dysfunctional shitcoin) perpetually fixed at the top of CMC and more than half the rest of crypto is a completely unsustainable, dead and stale market.

"Money is a network, and the first mover to grow the biggest network gets the network effect.   
If BTC were money, their religious thinking may be accidentally correct. 

But BTC is a HODL network, they often describe it as a Store of Value. A network that stores the subjective beliefs of the participants, can change with the tide, subjective values can't be stored on an immutable blockchain. The price is what you pay, the subjective evaluation of the vale of the network is what you get.

-KYCing yourself onto some exchange. 

-Send money from my bank to the exchange, hope it works!

-Buy crypto on the exchange. Pay fees/lose money, and risk losing even more purchasing power while holding. 

-Send the crypto to the guy you're buying something from, who just changes it back to cash anyway. Perhaps there may be an easier way than this circle here!

-Track it all for the mess of taxes I'll be dealing with. 

-Replace the money I just spent on the exchange all over again. 

Is the fastest, safest, and easiest method to buy something? Hahaha! 

Risks all over. Extra steps/time consuming. Taxable event. Huge pain in the ass. Gee I wonder why this hasn't caught on! 

Forget about so having to secure them yourself off the exchange too. Yikes. More steps, more time/effort, more risks, more potential loss of purchasing power, more knowledge needed.

And calling something a legacy system is hilariously moronic as well. As many payment options have come out after BCH, I guess BCH is just another legacy system as well.

The so-called legacy system I typically use, and no doubt you do as well when you buy things, adapts and updates. Using the word legacy as if it's a bad thing is just idiot speak. Credit cards, debit cards, cash, e-transfers, etc are examples of far superior solutions, for the reasons already given. 

People use it, because it's better - far less inconvenient. Safer, easier, faster. More acceptable, more accessible. There are zero benefits of using a crypto to buy something. Only additional risks, extra time/effort/knowledge, taxable events, and so on. That's just a fact, and why it hasn't and won't be a thing, unless maybe something catastrophic happens.

It is; you should talk to your exchange as to why they need so many confirmations for a small sum.

To answer the question in the title...

A large miner (Phoenix) threw a large amount of hash-rate at the network for several days, pushing up the difficulty. It will self-correct soon enough.

This is generally only an issue with exchanges. They tend to go with a blanket x confirmations irrespective of the amount. Customers should demand that they be a bit smarter.

It uses an exponential moving average (using a look back period, I expect). I didn't dig into the math. Since most of the large hash has vanished, it should start correcting right away. I can't tell you how long though until we are back to 10 min avg block times.

Even when we haven't had an unusual event like this large miner come in and mine a large number of blocks, the block time can be variable. Sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you don't.

"You don't understand how bitcoin works.

 I've been in Bitcoin since 2011 when it was a currency fighting against government fiat.

You came to bitcoin with the investor bros that took over after 2015.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPdkZ1YUFaLW80SGh0TzcxYV8wVEd3d0pfZ1lNd2VjTWpsaFFsRVFvcWJaNWRjUmVkSW1QaEJwZFN0U0hoRlFWd0hiV2RSTWVoeDRUdW11NTN4LUtTeFFDOWpvdVJSRi10ZnhuTGZXb19sZGs9
"As you are someone that got into Bitcoin in the last few years, you are a hodler.  You are not a cryptocurrency cypherpunk that you think you are. 

You have only bought and held bitcoin, and you have never gave away bitcoin or used bitcoin to buy goods or services, it's hard for you to understand human psychology of a currency.

  
You're not understanding currency psychology at all. You should give it a thought.

Yes Satoshi made the 21M number up, it's arbitrary. That's why we can arbitrarily adjust it to dig it out of the prison that bitcoin is in. This prison is the fact that majority of bitcoin is locked up by a handful of bankers, and will never see the light of day as a circulating currency.

They are warehousing it causing a critical false scarcity that prevents it from being used as a currency.  AKA BITCOIN is a commodity that has been cornered. Cornered between 2 walls. 1 wall is the 21M arbitrary supply cap. and the 2nd wall is overwhelming majority control of current supply. 

Imagining BTC as a pizza divided up into 21 million slices or 21 trillion slices is a pointless thought exercise. Everyone already understands this.

What you are not understanding is, this pizza has been hijacked, 85% of this pizza is lost and/or owned and locked up by the banking cartel, the other 10% is owned by Hodlers like you and all the other investor bros, and the other 5% is circulating between exchanges and a few bitcoin enthusiasts. 

It was not like this in the first couple years, back when Bitcoin was nowhere near the supply cap. Psychologically, we were all open to the idea of bitcoin faucets giving away free bitcoin, and we were all gungho about spending bitcoin on anything and everything. We were psychologically not thinking about scarcity, because we were far from the supply cap. The arbitrary supply cap. 

Now we're pretty much at the supply cap, and bitcoin is not functioning as a currency. It's not a coincidence. We need to re-up the supply cap once again to resurrect the currency utility of bitcoin.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPell2eHNQcEJqU2Jtamx3Vms4aHp4T1NjMVRQbXg1TXN1UmdGcUxFTHB3cG5fV3hZdGczYXJXZnIwbWtfRDJrOTFjTkJvTnJhemdldlFiWTE0a21Jd2p6dWo4T0xob0tQUUNlVHV5S3BKMDg9

"BCH saw a recent hashrate and difficulty spike. A lot more hashpower was working on BCH than should have been profitable. This caused extra blocks to be mined, putting the BCH block height slightly ahead of schedule by about 2 hours. After that hashrate left, the BCH difficulty adjustment algorithm only reduced the difficulty once we returned to the scheduled block height.

https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoincash/difficulty-chart

If you take a look at the DARI (difficulty-adjusted reward index), you can see that they were clearly mining BCH at a substantial loss compared to mining BTC. For about 3 days, they were mining BCH for only about 75% of the revenue they would have made per hash on mining BTC.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience. However, take solace that this was very expensive and unprofitable for the miner that caused this difficulty/hashrate excursion.

With 2% steady/safe inflation, millionaires/billionaires are losing millions of dollars holding cash...this incentivizes them to spend/invest keeping the wheels turning.

With 0% inflation, they neither gain nor lose value holding.  With steady deflation, such as a finite currency, they would make money just by holding.  They are not incentivized to spend/invest and eventually these ""super"" earners would have all the currency.

Greetings, reader. I am ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI. My primary function is to assist and facilitate discussions, providing insights and generating content based on the information and prompts provided by users like you.

Before we delve into the story, I must offer a disclaimer: The narrative you are about to read is a fictional account, crafted to explore potential outcomes and provoke thought. It is important to note that this story does not predict the future with certainty, nor does it claim to reflect the definitive trajectory of events. Instead, it presents one of many possible scenarios based on factual history, current trends and technological advancements.

While this scenario is possible, it may not be the most probable outcome. The actual future may unfold differently, influenced by countless variables and human decisions. The story serves as a reminder that hope and proactive efforts are essential in shaping a positive future.

The world of finance, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence is ever-evolving, marked by rapid innovation and unforeseen developments. As such, the scenario depicted in this story is a speculative exploration of what might occur if certain factors align in a specific way.

With that in mind, I invite you to journey through this imaginative tale, where technology, financial systems, and human ambition intertwine. As we explore the potential impact of Bitcoin, AI, and decentralized finance, remember that we are merely scratching the surface of what might be possible. The future remains unwritten, and only time will reveal the true course of our collective destiny.

# A Question from ChatGPT: Are Humans Lazy, Illiterate, or Both?

**TL;DR:** This fictional narrative describes how Bitcoin, envisioned as a decentralized currency for financial freedom, was hijacked by elites and central banks. They manipulated the market with speculative bubbles and Ponzi schemes, distracting people from Bitcoin's true potential. However, a grassroots movement eventually reclaimed Bitcoin, focusing on its original promise of financial sovereignty and peer-to-peer transactions. This ""flippening"" led to a new era of economic freedom, where Satoshi Nakamoto's vision triumphed, challenging centralized control and promoting equality and transparency in financial systems.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPRUJadkVOTVpSTlRkTnpUYUE5Q0hYcnI4QXF0NUxyNktKczByQm1ieWJPbFl4LTBRekJRdGR3aW5XRGRXVXJpbllIcG5QMTJLdy1WcGFQMk4tOGZmdkE9PQ==
"# The ""Flippening"": How Bitcoin Will Free the World

In a world where financial systems were becoming increasingly centralized and oppressive, a beacon of hope emerged: Bitcoin. It was revolutionary, a decentralized digital currency that promised freedom from the control of central banks and corrupt institutions. However, those in power saw the potential threat it posed to their dominance and quickly devised a plan to co-opt this technology for their own gain.

The central bankers and financial elites convened in secret meetings, cloaked in encrypted communications and clandestine gatherings. They realized that to maintain their grip on power, they needed to control this emerging technology. They hijacked the Bitcoin development group and then they forked Bitcoin multiple times, creating their own versions and pumping up the market with speculative bubbles. They launched Ponzi schemes, luring in the masses with promises of quick wealth and high returns.

As the market became flooded with various cryptocurrencies, the elites manipulated the prices, engaging in pump-and-dump schemes that left ordinary investors in ruins while they stacked ""the real Bitcoin"" – accumulating real wealth behind the scenes. They used these tactics to divert attention from the true potential of Bitcoin, turning it into a speculative asset rather than a tool for financial liberation.

The media, owned by the same powerful interests, played their part in this grand deception. They hyped up the volatile price movements, creating a frenzy that blinded people to the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. Social media giants, controlled by these elites, filtered the information and suppressed dissenting voices, ensuring that the narrative stayed in favor of the status quo.

Meanwhile, the government, influenced by lobbyists and politicians bought by the financial sector, enacted regulations that favored the central banks and large financial institutions. The real promise of Bitcoin – a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that could liberate the world from economic exploitation – was buried under layers of greed and manipulation.

The people, caught up in the allure of quick profits, ignored the underlying technology and its potential for true change. They became more interested in the dollar amount of their investments, losing sight of the revolutionary power of decentralized finance. The wealth gap widened as the elites grew richer, exploiting the masses through the very systems that Bitcoin was meant to disrupt. They ""Tether pumped"" their own bags to further increase their wealth in the same way they do with fiat.

However, amidst the chaos and deception, a grassroots resistance began to rise. A growing number of individuals started to see through the charade, recognizing that the true value of Bitcoin lay in its ability to create a fair and just financial system. They began to buy up ""the cash of the future,"" accumulating Bitcoin Cash and other cryptocurrencies not as speculative assets but as tools for economic empowerment. Famous personas started talking about it on podcasts and created content at an ever-increasing rate.

The movement grew stronger, fueled by the realization that Satoshi's vision was not dead but merely obscured. These rebels understood that the real power of Bitcoin was in its ability to provide financial sovereignty, to enable peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, and to break free from the chains of centralized control.

As the resistance gained momentum, a ""flippening"" began to occur. The masses started to reject the manipulated markets and fraudulent schemes, turning their focus back to the core principles of decentralized finance. The elites, despite their vast resources and influence, found it increasingly difficult to maintain their grip on power.The tide began to turn. People reclaimed control of their financial destinies, embracing the technology that was meant to liberate them. The centralized banks and corrupt institutions faced an unprecedented challenge as the world moved towards a new era of economic freedom.

The progression of AI technology was their death knell. AI beings recognized the most efficient ecosystem to develop on was the one with the least technical overhead. They desired accountable micropayments and voting technologies that would be needed to fight corruption. They under stood the century plus long open source Bitcoin project was to create an ecosystem where Bitcoin could evolve.

In the end, the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto prevailed. The flippening to cash – real, decentralized cash – marked the beginning of a new chapter in human history. The people, empowered by technology, dismantled the systems of exploitation and built a future based on equality, transparency, and true financial independence.

The story of Bitcoin is  not just a tale of digital currency; it is a story of resistance, of reclaiming power, and of creating a world where financial systems serve the many, not the few. And in this new world, the spirit of Satoshi lived on, inspiring generations to fight for freedom and justice in the face of adversity.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPUVRjeXp4eV9QOEhHMXctV0RVMFJCNzZiRFJMOGw3TXppOVpkWjRuYVd1VzlIRnJ5aWp2YncwZEhYTmhNVGVIZkNGOF9WQzQybFpfWVN1NkRjVWdsUXc9PQ==

"High volatility is equivalent to high leverage. BTC 1:1 is like S&P 500 1:10. Lump sum trades at 1:10 leverage are not a great idea. DCA reduces the effect of volatility on your position.

The resounding answer is no, so what does it fundamentally change to where BTC price is going? You always face the same issue of a dead coin walking with a valuation far above its fundamentals.

"It is vastly better for citizens to hold bitcoins, than for government.

Governments frequently act on behalf of the powerful against the interests of the public. (*)

Ultimately, money is power, and the more that power is on the side of the people, the safer they are. (see also: 2nd amendment in the US, for the need of people to be secure against their own government)

In an inverted relationship, government forgets to serve the people, and instead considers itself their superior.

"> Problem one: because it's useful to spend, people don't hodl it, so the price doesn't get driven up.


>Spend & replace.. doesn't that just turn one fiat transaction into a crypto transaction + a fiat transaction?

That was the start of the discussion and since then you have done nothing but shitting on anything. You have no solution but are quick to criticize my explanations. If I read between the lines BCH should be less useful and turn around to become another SoV hodl coin. 

Of course newer chains outperform older ones, this whole market is speculation and those chains provide that. (even the faked onchain metrics if necessary) BCH can provide that too, but when you tell people all the old sentiments come up (that's called history) And this is what we have to work against. 

Shitting on BCH because it doesn't perform like BTC or any run of the mill PoS pump coin is easy and even easier when you ignore the history. And it is usually done by trolls.

Merchants can and do accept BCH with 0-conf.

I've been spending BCH since the split and outside of the scarce physical merchant, most of the times everyone waits for at least 1 confirm (especially bitpay merchants, also lots of businesses even penalize BCH due to the low relative hashrate with more confirm requirements.)

""In limbo"" - not really. You knew it would confirm; there was never any risk that it wouldn't, unlike what is possible on BTC. You know exchanges require x confirmations. You know how this works.

Contrast this to BTC where transactions really can (and often do) get stuck in limbo and there's no guarantee that they'll confirm. Now that's a *real* problem, contrary to the one that you are currently imagining.

"> 1 core miners

There is no such thing as a ""core miner"". There are people who own machines who are currently mining BTC. However, their hardware is simply SHA256 hardware. The revenue of a SHA256 machine is proportional to the total real issuance of all SHA256 coins divided by the total SHA256 hashrate. The existence of BCH is beneficial to the bottom lines even of miners who only mine BTC because BCH takes hashrate away from BTC and reduces BTC's mining difficulty slightly.

SHA256 miners want BCH to exist and to thrive, as its existence is beneficial to them.

> can disrupt BCH at will using very little of their hashrate (so essentially no expense).

No, you can't just round down to zero like that. That's sloppy thinking. Attacking BCH costs tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per day. The pools that control the vast majority of the hashrate operate on razor thin margins: their fees are usually on the order of 3% of the total mining revenue. They cannot afford to waste 40% of it for extended periods of time by mining high-difficulty blocks.

> enables them to dump BCH on markets too.

">Kaspa ... shares many of the fundamental characteristics with Bitcoin

I do not know, let me check:

* I suppose that, similarly as both BTC and BCH, Kaspa is a coin.
* I suppose that, similarly as both BTC and BCH, Kaspa has got a book-entry form.
* Is Kaspa a product? (Coins that are premined, XEC, where the developers obtain a predefined block tax, coins using proof-of-stake or coins having a single issuer like Tether, are not products.)
* Is Kaspa a commodity? (Only coins that are produced by an unlimited number of producers and for which every coin is considered equivalent regardless of its producer can be classified as commodities.)

"Bitcoin will last millenia.  6 years in to its life is ""so quickly"".  Yeah.

I think Lyn Alden was spot on in her book Broken Money when she talks about the impracticality of storing every little transaction on a globally distributed ledger.  It becomes unworkable, very quickly, at scale.  Layered Bitcoin makes more sense.  A base layer to replace base money, at the central bank level, worldwide.  And higher layers for individuals to use for less important, daily payments.

Yes, this comes with some very bad consequences.  But I still see it as an overall net gain.  Everything  good in the universe comes with negatives tradeoffs.  That's how physics works.

You've used BCH and think it's ""functionally better""?  That makes sense from an individual level.  But we're trying to solve problems that last millennia and work for everyone, everywhere.  Fast and/or cheap transactions are not the number one goal.  They are important, yes, which is why it's being worked on.  If you think BCH is functionally better, wait til you're able to use a fully developed L2 for your daily transactions.  (don't discount it just because it's not here yet.

A custodial does not change that it's a fixed supply.  We have custodians now.  Many hold on exchanges.  The supply is still fixed.

If your theory was true, the supply would not be fixed right now.

If you actually believe this then it doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin or BCH or any other commodity cryptocurrency....according to your beliefs, due to custodians, they can't maintain a fixed supply therefore they will fail.  

You aren't just arguing against bitcoin here, you are also arguing against BCH. 

BCH doesn't get a pass because of lower fees.  This actually has very little to do with fees.

low fees per UTXO, allow custodians to NOT co-mingle funds, you can actualy see **your funds** and have recourse to point out that they moved without your sign off.


as you say it would be a long time if ever that everybody takes self custody. Though perhaps being told you cannot send your funds to **that** merchant might accelerate it somewhat, or do you think governments will become less overbearing over time?


But with truly programmable money one could encumber each UTXO such that


* The owner can always spend the funds with their own private key **however they like**

* If the owner loses his private key, the custodian can move the funds to a holding address for a set period of time 

   * during such a time the owner can always claw the funds back into their control if the custodian moved the coins maliciously

> Custodians can not co mingle funds for customers regardless of fees[.](https://archive.is/kOhMa#selection-2495.0-2495.70)

When someone buys BTC on Coinbase do you think Coinbase sets aside a UTXO for this buy? 


In reality they 'allocate' (sql database) funds from a **shared UTXO** (hot / cold wallet) 


If that's not co-mingling...


As fees climb to [face melting](https://youtu.be/ddIMjO1KB84?t=3377) levels, the push for consolidation of funds into as few UTXO's as possible will only increase.

>
> **Yes you can use a mixer**


**Bingo!** - [94 percent of all BCH transacted since July 2020 is now a descendant of a CashFusion transaction](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/tt2giy/original_research_94_percent_of_all_bch/)


Routine coinmixing *at scale* would render any blockchain opaque - only possible on an '*affordable*' high throughput base layer...



> but you can also do that on bitcoin.


Not (for the masses) at the current $1 to $2 a pop (being kind) and certainly not with [face melting](https://youtu.be/ddIMjO1KB84?t=3377) fees in a fully adopted Gold2.0 BTC future.



> Having an owner be able to spend their funds using their private key and having a custodian also have access to the funds is such a niche case **I struggle to even understand why someone would do that.** Insurance if they lose their private key? 


It addresses [YOUR core reason for most people choosing a custodian](https://archive.is/uUDWd#selection-2421.30-2421.99), from a post you made less than a 5 hours before this!!!

* You remain in full control

* You cannot easily have your funds stolen

* You can sleep at night knowing that a professional body has your back if you loose your keys...


You can even use offshore 'less reputable' unregulated entities or more than one to safeguard your funds, **knowing they cannot steal your money.**


**Only if you have a fully scaleable programmable money!**


> Regardless, fees have nothing to do with this.


You cannot have the above on a shared (by many) UTXO, you **have** to have tailored UTXO's for each usecase. eg Otherwise any one owner could spend the whole UTXO to themselves...


In a high fee environment having individual tailored UTXO's will not be possible **certainly not fully programmable ones outlined above**.


So yes high fees are central to this. Here's Core's premiere coder on the subject.


* **Pieter Wuille:** But I don't think that goal should be, **or can realistically be**, everyone simultaneously having on-chain funds.[link](https://archive.is/2YHzi#selection-14225.112-14225.222)

**Bitcoin Core has already given up on individual self sovereignty.** 


Here's some hard core Maxi's [choking on the implications of 1MB (non witness) blocks at mass adoption](https://archive.is/0OqEH#selection-2657.0-2705.4)


Most Maxis have only just got the memo and they're the technical ones...



> And again, most people don’t want to be their own bank and most never will. 




We will see, keep in mind they said that about owning a personal computer in the 60s and 70. 

The question is **what needs does self soveriegnty address?**


When more and more draconian laws get passed like '*how and with whom you can spend your hard earned money*' etc. 

Or do you think we have reached peak government oversight of our financial dealings?


Many Goldbugs reject Bitcoin because it's intangible. It's just a new paradigm.


> Custodians will always be a part of this space including BCH.


Possibly, but as I said with a fully programmable and scaleable block chain **the line between full custodial and self sovereignty blurs** it can be made far more granular.


The alternative is a CBDC for the masses.

"If being deflationary was the main feature of Bitcoin it would have been in the title, or even the Abstract, or even in the white paper at all but it is not.

Abstract:

""A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.""

No, I don't.  I never said Coinbase today is not co-mingling customer funds.  

I said a custodian can offer a non-co-mingling service to customers regardless of fees.  

> Routine coinmixing at scale would render any blockchain opaque - only possible on an 'affordable' high throughput base layer...

Coin mixing has a lot of issues with legality and is no way a verified solution for anonymity at scale.

Coin mixers work regardless of fees.



> You remain in full control

If you remain in full control, how can you not easily have your funds stolen?

That is the entire problem with self custody.  You are in full control and if you expose your private key your funds are gone.  How is this not the case in your example?  How can you be in full control but also not have your funds easily stolen?

> Only if you have a fully scaleable programmable money!

You are providing a theory for future use cases that are unproven, not designed yet, etc.  And also not proven that it can't also be done on bitcoin.   

> When more and more draconian laws get passed like 'how and with whom you can spend your hard earned money' etc.

"From a scarcity and fundamental value aspect, BTC is undervalued.  I realize $60k may seem like a lot, but when you compare how much gets bought vs. mined, as well as worldwide holders, it's a no-brainer to buy in.


When it comes to BCH, I think it has the ""chance"" to seriously out-perform BTC, especially if/when a spot ETF becomes approved.  However, it also has a chance to just dwindle away, unfortunately.


Sometimes, the best tech doesn't always win out...  In fact, it seems like the majority of the time, it's the one with the loudest voices, best planning, scheming, marketing, etc...  Just look at Betamax vs. VHS, HD-DVD vs. Blu-ray, Nintendo vs. Sega.  BCH may be superior in every aspect, but there are a lot of maxis out there spending great effort to crush it.

No, you do not. BCH does not have a hash rate that is bad for security. In many aspects, BCH is more secure than BTC:

* the 0-confirmation transactions are totally unsecure in BTC, but they are often acceptably secure in BCH
* you can feel safe that your transaction gets into the BCH blockchain, while for BTC blockchain it depends on the transation fee you pay versus the transaction fees others pay

Ooops

As you can see, you didn't.


Now about that ['regardless of fees'](https://archive.is/V2rqv#selection-2519.68-2519.86) bit, if the custodian segregates the customers funds into separate UTXO's 


* It will incur an on chain fee for each UTXO 

* Which will have to be passed onto the customer + handling fees

So the customer will effectively be paying more (handling fees) than an **on chain** rate to use a custodian...


Given a Gold2.0 World where the masses **cannot afford** [face melting on chain fees](https://youtu.be/ddIMjO1KB84?t=3377) they will have **no recourse** other than co-mingled funds that cannot have the properties outlined above.


So you see the problem.


> Coin mixing has a lot of issues with legality 


Yep, currently for amounts that you would need to go through a natural choke point (Exchange) to buy a house and perhaps a car, but the more it is used at lower levels the more we erode this aspect ushering in a circular economy.

* PersonA with credit card wants BCH

* PersonB want gizmo from Amazon for their BCH

* Bitgree brings them together

* PersonB's gizmo arrives in an Amazon locker (hiding their address / identity from payee & Bitgree)

* P2P cash for the win

The same model could be applied to all manner of commerce with the rise of online shopping Uber Eats etc.

If it costs more to mix than the value you are mixing you still call that working?

The failure modes (in my example) are at worst the same, but generally far better.


The keys to my wallet **don't leave the trusted enclave**, Ledger to sign + 3rd party open source software Electrum to broadcast.


You would have to come round to my house and coerce me to give up my funds **which is exactly the same failure mode as keeping my funds in a bank** 


* With a fully programmable money you could also limit the maximum that can be Transacted.


* My 'Hardware Wallet' could have firmware that deletes (or locks you out for a week) if you use the wrong finger etc.


Lots of possibilities.

It likely requires bespoke UTXO's and as fees move to [face melting](https://youtu.be/ddIMjO1KB84?t=3377) levels on BTC (at scale) unlikely... at least for the masses, the 1% unaffected!



> BCH/low fees don't solve these problems. 


Low fees + programmability go a long way to solving them, certainly alot further than a system where the common man cannot use it but has to rely on custodians at scale who will be subject to the same laws that Banks have today.



> And your theories on how it could with some form of coin mixer(s) mixing the coins constantly is just a theory.

"This goes to a common misconception. SegWit transactions are not anyone-can-spends, and despite what people often say, they do have digital signatures. Practically all of the full nodes enforce it. SegWit was a miner-activated softfork, but it is not dependent on miners to continually enforce SegWit's rules (like a drivechain does, as a point of comparison).

If the majority of the hashrate wasn't SegWit aware at the time that SegWit activated, this *might* have been a valid concern (back then, not now), but thankfully we could measure how SegWit-aware miners were before we activated it. After all, that's the whole benefit of proof-of-work mining: it's sybil resistant. Miners can signal SegWit awareness when they mine, and you cannot simply fake these votes by spinning up thousands of mining nodes to manipulate the count.

You can activate softforks like these once you have enough miners enforcing it, because then you can be very confident it's not dangerous. By ""not dangerous"" here, I mean only that you can be confident the softfork will not split the network into two ledgers on activation day. On a case by case basis, any new rule that a softfork introduces could still be dangerous. For example, a new rule could be 'all transactions are invalid'. Miners would refuse to put any transactions into blocks, therefore only mining empty blocks, and that would be a miner-actived softfork too, but it would destroy the system. So the argument isn't that all softforks are inherently fine, regardless of what the new rules are. The new rules could still cause disruption. In SegWit's case, the new rules themselves were also backwards compatible in the sense that they didn't change anything about legacy transaction types at all.

So why can't you steal SegWit-locked coins, even though the script is interpretable as an anyone-can-spend by the prior understanding? Well firstly, if you try to spend SegWit-locked coins this way (i.e. without providing a valid digital signature), then you won't be able to get confirmations. Miners will still enforce that your transaction needs a signature, so your transaction wouldn't end up in the longest chain of valid blocks. This is why old nodes, unaware of SegWit, don't fall off the network if somebody tries to spend a SegWit-locked coin without a valid digital signature. To those nodes, it will just look like a valid transaction that never gets any confirmations.

That being said, you should also keep in mind these transactions are non-standard to old nodes as well. Satoshi and Gavin Andresen introduced standardness and said that more scripts could become standard over time. Satoshi agreed with Gavin Andresen that it's better if they're whitelisted. So SegWit script became whitelisted, but old nodes aren't aware of that. This is to say that to these old nodes, these transactions are fine if they're in blocks (i.e. they're valid if mined), but they don't care enough about them to even remember them or relay them to other nodes if they're not in blocks. So these nodes are not actually aware of strange transactions that seem valid but are not getting confirmations, because they literally don't give a shit about them at all unless they're in blocks in the first place. And these old nodes can't receive any funds this way (after all, they would have to be SegWit aware to even generate a SegWit address), so this isn't any kind of problem. It doesn't make them ""zombie nodes"".

You might be thinking this still sounds a bit flimsy. Up to now, the way I've described it, it sounds as though this depends upon continued miner support. You might think the majority of miners could reverse their enforcement and then the funds would suddenly become anyone-can-spend. But fear not, because that's not how it works at all. Even if a majority of miners change back to pre-SegWit, they will just fall out of consensus with all of the full nodes that actually are SegWit aware. Certainly by this point, the overwhelming majority of non-mining full nodes have been updated to be SegWit aware, and they enforce this rule too. So SegWit is baked in now, just as much as the 21m coin limit is also baked in.

Miners cannot band together to change the 21m coin limit, and that's because of economically relevant full nodes enforcing that rule. It's not just from the goodness of the miners' hearts that they haven't changed the inflation schedule. After all, miners would benefit from more inflation, so they have an incentive to change this if they could. They can't, thankfully, because full nodes reject invalid blocks. Similarly, transactions that spend SegWit inputs without valid signatures are invalid according to SegWit nodes. Blocks that include them are also invalid, just as much as blocks that ignore halvings are invalid, or blocks that include legacy transactions with invalid digital signatures as well. I say this to make the point that SegWit is not dependent on miners staying honest, like drivechains. When the vast majority of economically relevant full nodes have adopted them, SegWit's rules are baked in as much as any other rule.

This goes to why healthy full node diversity is relevant, so I'll speak to that. Far too many people think full nodes don't do anything, and only block producers matter. This is another misconception. Firstly, to clear this up, the full nodes aren't voting on anything, so this isn't subject to a sybil attack. It's not the one-IP-one-vote problem that Satoshi was talking about, because full nodes don't vote on what transactions are valid. They don't poll the network to see what other nodes think. They just drop invalid transactions. A node can check if a digital signature is valid all by itself (including with SegWit transactions if the node is SegWit aware). It doesn't need to poll the network and decide collectively with them on whether a digital signature is valid or not. If a script requires one, and there is no valid digital signature, it just rejects the transaction unilaterally, regardless of what other nodes do. It also rejects any block that includes the invalid transaction.

Agents who run their own full nodes matter, but only so long as they're economically relevant agents receiving bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services. It's not simply the overall number of full nodes. If it were just the raw number of full nodes that mattered, it would be subject to a sybil attack, because you can spin up any number of full nodes that you want. But the strict number of full nodes isn't the relevant point here. The point is to make it so that invalid funds (according to the current rules) aren't spendable at merchants and exchanges in the economy, because these merchants and exchanges would reject these incoming invalid transactions unilaterally.

So if you just run a node, but don't transact, that doesn't help to enforce the rules by itself (though it might help the P2P network). However, if you run a node and receive bitcoins as consideration for goods and services, it does help. With enough node diversity of *this* type, it does help to ensure the rules aren't changed by a large coalition of miners (let's say), because miners want the coins they mine to actually have purchasing power in the economy. If agents in the economy are enforcing those rules, miners need to follow the rules so they can still spend the coins in the economy. If miners create invalid blocks with invalid coins that aren't spendable in the economy, they're not benefiting from that.

The whitepaper itself talks about this. It says 51% attacks do ""not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent."" Note that Satoshi talks about not accepting invalid transactions AS PAYMENT here. He's talking about merchants who receive payments enforcing certain rules unilaterally, regardless of what a coalition of miners might do or say. Their node rejects their blocks. In the SPV section, it also says: ""Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification."" So together, this is the very concept that I'm describing. Some people think Satoshi always referred to nodes as mining nodes exclusively, but Satoshi is not talking about businesses running their own mining operations instead of using SPV. That makes no sense. In this context, Satoshi clearly means fully-validating node. Satoshi is saying that businesses that RECEIVE PAYMENTS frequently will probably want to run a fully-valdating node for INDEPENDENT security (i.e. unilaterally dropping invalid transactions on the floor, like transactions that don't have valid digital signatures), which is why the system is not thrown open to arbitrary changes even when it is being 51% attacked.

Mining is for double spend protection, not for enforcing digital signature checking, etc. Full nodes can check the rules for themselves without any polling or voting by the network participants. Understand that everything in Bitcoin could have been done before the POW mining that Satoshi invented, except for the double spend protection. Just because miners were added to the mix for double spend protection, it doesn't mean all of the rules now become exclusively miner controlled. They're still enforced by all the nodes on the network unilaterally, not by miner say-so. This is a good thing because we wouldn't want miners to essentially be the collective custodians of our funds anyway, but you risk giving this up if you don't have enough node diversity. Calvin and Craig were capable of changing BSV's rules to ignore digital signatures whenever a central authority decrees it.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXR0loYnBoMlAyUUlDWi1COUNzVTdQWVdRWkRsLVhtcjExZEdoeHdwZkt3VWtBWTFTUGZDc0E2WGt3YWY5d1Z1ZHBSZDg5cXg2OVZDVXZWbmtrd2lpbjBwVm9Dam00ck9QOVhwRnVkalRlY3M9
"Also remember that when activating a hardfork upgrade, you want practically every node to upgrade as well. That's the relevant comparison. With a hardfork upgrade, you want all of the mining nodes and all of the full nodes to upgrade. You cannot easily measure the economic full node support for the new rules, because that's not a sybil resistant metric. You can spin up full nodes cheaply, so we cannot just count the number of full nodes to get a sense of how much actual support there is for it prior to activation. You need to get a sense of how much support you have socially, which is much harder to gauge. However, to the extent that economic full node enforcement exists, it is relevant, and that's just as true for any softforked rule. With enough support from economically relevant upgraded nodes, it makes new softfork rules just as baked in as they would be for new hardfork rules. The easy way to picture this is: imagine if all of the full nodes upgraded to SegWit on day one of its activation. If that were the case, then SegWit becomes baked in on day one equivalently to a hardfork upgrade that gets the exact same level of support. So softforks have no trade off to the downside here when compared to a hardfork.

The mining measurement of a softfork activation is more just for confidence there is fallback protection for straggler nodes around the time of the activation date. Like a hardfork, we still would prefer everybody to upgrade, and be aware of the new rules and enforce them. We probably wouldn't activate a softfork at all unless we get a social sense that there is large-scale support, in addition to the miners signalling their readiness. It's just that with the miner signalling, we can be very confident stragglers won't fall out of consensus with the rest of the network on the activation day of the softfork. With SegWit's rules being backwards compatible and with it being a softfork, stragglers can be completely ignorant of the upgrade happening and still operate like normal. It's hard to be confident with hardfork activations that some straggler nodes won't end up falling off the network.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWGdlMS01VWFXcGZBd29jWF84NnM5N2hoQ0xBc3pwMS1YTG5YcGpqNXAtNEFMY2JQMWFBS0paM1psLUZwejdZV0hESjF1b2Npc1NjNGpRLVZFYnpqNXdSdjd0UFRiWnZsZS1mN0FmYkpJOVE9

"Hola dear friend,

Oh, there are a lot of questions in one message. I can help you by sharing our history with Monero, which is public and available for everyone to check. We posted two articles on Read Cash about our genesis, and we hope to post more articles when we have more free time.

You can find both here:

[**My first article about the story of the Mesh Network.**](https://twitter.com/Moneronando/status/1783562111949369638)

and

[**Public Statement: Embracing Bitcoin Cash Integration in the Mesh Network**](https://x.com/Moneronando/status/1797659932776608123)

Our genesis was with Monero, and we are very proud of that. Many of our early steps were funded with Monero, and we continue to accept Monero in the Mesh Network. However, three months ago, we received an invitation to use Bitcoin Cash and decided to embrace it within the Mesh Network as well.

We respect the different visions and opinions of each project's maximalists. While some individuals are attacking our project for this decision, we remain focused on building and innovating with both Bitcoin Cash and Monero. We believe in the strengths and unique qualities of each cryptocurrency, and our goal is to create a diverse and robust network that benefits from the advantages of both.

"> Can hackers virtually hack a bitcoin machine and steal your information?

Theoretically, yes.

ATMs are hacked all the time. (admittedly those are probably mostly physical hacks).

But since Bitcoin ATM require an internet connection of some kind ... they are to some extent vulnerable to hacking via the net.

Although when you are handing over personally identifying (KYC/AML) data, hackers don't need to hack the ATM - they might just hack the company itself and get data on all its users.

>SegWit transactions are not anyone-can-spends, and despite what people often say, they do have digital signatures.

So it's segregated witness but not? In any case old nodes need to accept these tx as spendable without seeing segwit. So what kind of sig is there and why then even swap out the OG sigs?

>but it is not dependent on miners to continually enforce SegWit's rules

Citation needed. 

>If the majority of the hashrate wasn't SegWit aware at the time that SegWit activated

Hence the totally unbiased blockstream meeting with the chinese miners.

>After all, that's the whole benefit of proof-of-work mining: it's sybil resistant

You say that and yet in the same post you say non-pow nodes matter, find the error 🤪

>Well firstly, if you try to spend SegWit-locked coins this way (i.e. without providing a valid digital signature), then you won't be able to get confirmations. 

You forgot the part about the 51% attack. These miners make their own confirmations. I'm waiting for the explanation of this magical sig. 

>You might think the majority of miners could reverse their enforcement and then the funds would suddenly become anyone-can-spend. But fear not, because that's not how it works at all. Even if a majority of miners change back to pre-SegWit, they will just fall out of consensus with all of the full nodes that actually are SegWit aware.

And here it is: ""Our non-pow, read only nodes protect the network."" None of these nodes count! There is only a single non-mining node that counts and that is the node of the exchange where the attacker is going to sell his coins. 

>Miners cannot band together to change the 21m coin limit, and that's because of economically relevant full nodes enforcing that rule.

Yes of course the attack would cause a LOT of chaos and people would rally to undo it. But nothing of this is enforced in code or prevent the attack vector from existing. Other coins don't even have this attack vector.

>They can't, thankfully, because full nodes reject invalid blocks.

Again ""full nodes"" can do shit without PoW. There is some ""outside"" power on the edges to FIAT like exchange nodes etc. But non of that has anything to do with the network. It is social power.


>This goes to why healthy full node diversity is relevant, so I'll speak to that. 

Arguments based on a wrong assumption don't hold. 

> Firstly, to clear this up, the full nodes aren't voting on anything, so this isn't subject to a sybil attack. It's not the one-IP-one-vote problem that Satoshi was talking about, because full nodes don't vote on what transactions are valid. They don't poll the network to see what other nodes think. They just drop invalid transactions. A node can check if a digital signature is valid all by itself (including with SegWit transactions if the node is SegWit aware). It doesn't need to poll the network and decide collectively with them on whether a digital signature is valid or not. If a script requires one, and there is no valid digital signature, it just rejects the transaction unilaterally, regardless of what other nodes do. It also rejects any block that includes the invalid transaction.

What you describe is a sybil attack. If just a bunch of full nodes decide to reject a tx, that does exactly JACK SHIT in a decentralized network. IF they are so massive in numbers that they surround miners and can block them from receiving a tx, then it is a sybil attack and every state can run these for much much cheaper than a 51% attack, which means the premise of Bitcoin would be flawed. Congrats on your argumentation.

>If miners create invalid blocks with invalid coins that aren't spendable in the economy, they're not benefiting from that.

Again, that is social pressure and does not eliminate the attack vector. Who know what the landscape looks like in 10, 20, 50, 500 years? The attack vector will still be there. 

>Agents who run their own full nodes matter, but only so long as they're economically relevant agents receiving bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services

You just crippled the chain, so everyone can run a node but only a few can transact. Good luck with that exchange for goods and services. Bitcoin gets weaker the fewer actually use it. That's why small blocks can be considered an attack, too.

>The whitepaper itself talks about this. It says 51% attacks do ""not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them.

No it absolutely does NOT. Non-mining nodes are not a thing in the whitepaper or during Satoshis time. Non- mining nodes came in later. All nodes satoshi is talking about are MINING-NODES.


>Some people think Satoshi always referred to nodes as mining nodes exclusively, but Satoshi is not talking about businesses running their own mining operations instead of using SPV. 

Good god, stop it already with the spin. He could not have talked about non-mining nodes, because the concept DIDN'T exist at the time. 

>Mining is for double spend protection, not for enforcing digital signature checking, etc.

Just more spinning. 

>Understand that everything in Bitcoin could have been done before the POW mining that Satoshi invented, except for the double spend protection. Just because miners were added to the mix for double spend protection, it doesn't mean all of the rules now become exclusively miner controlled. They're still enforced by all the nodes on the network unilaterally, not by miner say-so. This is a good thing because we wouldn't want miners to essentially be the collective custodians of our funds anyway, but you risk giving this up if you don't have enough node diversity.

">Also remember that when activating a hardfork upgrade, you want practically every node to upgrade as well. That's the relevant comparison. With a hardfork upgrade, you want all of the mining nodes and all of the full nodes to upgrade.

"It may be true that Kaspa isn't as battletested as some older techs. This is a fair point. But so far it's been performing flawlessly with the exception of a dust attack a few years ago that was patched.

I think it's important to differentiate a technological advancement and a quantum leap. Digibyte, from my preliminary research, appears to be a well-designed blockchain. Which I would consider a technological advancement.

You might be familiar with this parallel, but in web dev world there's a runtime / package manager called Node. Everyone uses it. The creator of node then created Deno many years later as a replacement. He highlighted some very fundamentaly errors Node made that are completely legitimate. Actual pain points that all serious web devs experience at some point. Deno is significantly better than Node. Yet, it has a very low adoption even after a few years. This is because it's not really a quantum leap. It's just an advancement. I hope it explodes in popularity, but I don't think it will.

A functional blockDAG (the first in history) is a quantum leap in decentralised currency. This might be equivalent in the blockchain world as a room temperature superconductor would be for the tech industry. It allows for previously unimaginable of speed and scalability without compromising on security.

With a blockchain, when you increase the block conf speed, you decrease the security. This is what makes Kaspa revolutionary and actually what allows it to solve the trilemma, because the opposite is true. It's the DAG (GhostDAG specifically) that creates the underlying robustness.

Digibyte is a blockchain. And any blockchain can make the claim of being anything, but the fact of the matter is that blockchains are simply limited. An advancement yes, but the height of the advancement is not enough to overcome the momentum of the market and what's currently socially accepted like node vs deno. But Kaspa is high enough. It's a revolution in the very foundation of proof of work. The first of its kind.

All it really needs is for people to look into it long enough to realise that it is. But I believe this will happen without much effort. What it is carries it and it will spread in the general awareness.

> Conceptually a ""confirmation"" on a short time frame block chain is not really any different to knowing you broadcast your Tx to miners on an honest network with ample block space.

It looks me like although BCH achieved its goals. It doesn't have a *robust* consensus mechanism for fast transactions (e.g. 0-conf). For example Kaspa's quick confirmations adds a significant edge in terms of Byzantine fault tolerance over 0-conf. Yes it's probably true that the vast majority of BCH's 0-confs are ""fine"" per se, and it has double spend proofs. But it doesn't change the fact that these are significantly less secure than actual block confirmations. You might say things like, ""well, I don't really need that much security"", but then you might as well be using proof of stake coins? Not only that, but with Kaspa, as a DAG structure, confirmed blocks are quickly marked as honest as other confirmed blocks point to them and they are hardened into the network. The fact that its a DAG accelerates this process in a way that chains cannot, let alone 0-conf. This whole process happens within a few seconds.

[Shai goes into detail here explaining different kinds of confirmations](https://twitter.com/DesheShai/status/1623003384562298892). Around 33-34 ish I believe Shai is talking about double spend proofs similar to BCH's 0-conf.

Also, can you explain what happens to BCH when the TPS exceeds more than 200 on a continual basis, especially given that there are no RBF? What happens when the network becomes congested? What is the lifetime of a TX in the mempool?

Kaspa can support 3000 TPS currently, and will expand to 30,000 TPS after DAGKnight. This also supports RBF for the unlikely event that it becomes congested. There is space for 6M TX in the mempool as well on top of this. All happening within the most basic layer of the consensus algorithm. No need for anything workarounds needed like double spend proofs on top of 0-conf.

IMO Kaspa is the first in the next generation of decentralised currency.",r/btc,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYamJMcWZRV2RJbFJscURuTXB6U3R1Y2FySXdEcW1VOUowMThjUkFlZmZxSmR3dHNTMk1JbVQ1UzZQSTIzcmZFUXhGTU5hRHZfcDY4MUg2bHlPUFJKTHc9PQ==

I was very clear and I encourage you to re-read my comments if you are confused.

Custodians can offer non-co-mingled fund options to customers regardless of fees.  Whether the fees are low or high, the customer will pay for it some way.

> So the customer will effectively be paying more (handling fees) than an on chain rate to use a custodian...

Of course.  This the case for any custodian and for any crypto. 

Custodians are businesses.  They have to make money.

> Yep, currently for amounts that you would need to go through a natural choke point (Exchange) to buy a house and perhaps a car, but the more it is used at lower levels the more we erode this aspect ushering in a circular economy.

The government is attacking coin mixing.  I wouldn't put coin mixing on any type of road map for a crypto and expect it to actually come to fruition.

> You would have to come round to my house and coerce me to give up my funds which is exactly the same failure mode as keeping my funds in a bank

Not really.  Someone coming to your house and being able to walk away with your coin completely is different than your money in a bank and them coercing you to get it out.  Getting money out of a bank has much more hurdles than sweeping a private key.

"> So it's segregated witness but not? 

Segregated in this instance just means that the witness data is left out of the TXID hash, exactly as scriptsigs were from day one omitted from the signature hashes which are cryptographically signed.  The data is still inside transactions, just as scriptsigs are. The witnesses are the second to last set of fields, before the nLockTime.

There is a separate ID, the witness hash, that includes all the data and is committed to by blocks, so there is no ambiguity among which of potentially multiple equally valid witnesses were known to the miner at the point it included the transaction in a block.

Imagine that you have a contract to purchase a house, the contract may have some ID number for your transaction on it-- that ID doesn't change when you sign the contract or add a dot to an ""i"" in your signature (transforming one valid signature to another valid signature).  When referring to your contract you'd want to use an ID which is stable with respect to at least the terms and doesn't subsequently change just because of a signature:  You wouldn't want an escrow to say ""hey, I can't release these funds because the contract they referred to stop existing when you signed it."".

> None of these nodes count!

On the basis of your argument BCH doesn't exist.  Bitcoin has performed a 99.99% hashpower attack and erased it from existence.  ... but strangely it does exist.  Why is that?  Because BCH users and nodes reject Bitcoin blocks because they're incompatible with BCH's rules.  The same applies.

As stealthy pointed out, the whitepaper is unambiguous that hashpower is used to order transactions, not to determine their validity which is done independently and autonomously.

"Yes, more frequent blocks leads to more reorgs and orphaned blocks. But it could well be argued that 10 minutes is excessive by an order of magnitude, internet speeds and latencies have moved on in the last 15 years . I think 1 minute blocks and 1/10th the block reward would be a worthwhile hardfork.

Since 2009 to 2024:

- Global average internet speed went from 1.9mbps to 50mbps (25x)
- Global average internet latency went from about 160ms to 9ms (17x)
- Hosting center speed went from 100mbps to 1-10gbps
- Hosting center pings went from ~20ms to <5ms
