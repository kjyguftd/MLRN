"While it’s true that many Filipinos struggle with accent and grammar issues, it’s important to remember that we are usually capable of communicating effectively in English and other languages. We are adaptive and fast learners. Many foreign businesses hire us because they can’t afford to maintain their operations otherwise and thus turn to third-party companies to save money.

I have been working in a call center since I was 18 years old while studying. During my experience, I’ve noticed that many Americans often call for assistance on matters they could easily resolve by themselves. Questions are often trivial, like asking for form assistance or technical support for simple issues.

It’s baffling because these are things one could handle independently with a bit of effort. The sense of entitlement among many Americans is striking, influenced by their culture and environment.

Despite this, I am proud of my ability to maintain a professional manner while dealing with such situations. To the Americans reading this, I hope you take the initiative to learn and understand basic tasks.

Many of you seem to lack common sense and rely heavily on others for simple needs, which is frustrating. However, we continue to assist with patience and professionalism.

And I also want to say that most of you are: moron, putz, mook, shit bird, shit brick, ass, downy, retard, mouth breather, window licker, potato, clown, shit for brains, stupid, dipstick, inbred, failed abortion, dimwitt, air head, dumb, dummy, blonde.

Here’s some tongue-in-cheek advice: Instead of feeling entitled, why not study more and invest in a quality education? You might want to work on your common sense too it’s a rare commodity these days! Oh, and don’t forget to improve that credit score. US folks can be so gullible, always falling for scams and frauds, right? Hahaha! please work on those credit scores so you’re not out there begging for discounts like you just walked out of a thrift store! Some of you are so shameless with the money requests, it’s like you’re auditioning for a reality show! And let’s not even start on explaining things half the time, it’s like explaining rocket science to a toddler. It’s not just a language thing; it’s like you missed the class on common sense! Haha, step up your game, folks!

And to those Americans with strong accents who are also super entitled whether you’re Southern folks or not some of you are really rude. Just so you know, your accent can be annoying for us and probably for other nationalities too. Seriously, your accent isn’t any better, so don’t be hypocritical and make fun of others! Haha. Thus, just a disclaimer, this isn’t aimed at all Americans, just those entitled and rude ones. I’m just reciprocating the treatment! Haha. I’ve also had amazing encounters with other Americans, and it’s easy to tell when someone is sincere versus just faking their approach. So, let’s keep it real and maybe work on some of those not so charming traits. 

And oh, you Americans with your “Can I speak to someone who speaks English?” what, you think we’re talking in Klingon? You could just say you want an onshore or American agent without sounding ridiculous. Hahaha.

And for the love of sanity, why do you enroll in products, subscriptions, or life insurance, then blame the call centers when things go wrong? Newsflash: you’re not reading the fine print! You guys fall for scams like it’s a hobby. And then you call us, all huffy, saying the person who enrolled you didn’t explain things.

Plus it’s costly and time consuming to be constantly on/off boarding. 

I keep telling Paul all the time he needs balance and to set his priorities straight. He wants to get past an obstacle, but there will always be more to come.

"So either you can buy a giant stake of an existing company that’s doing great 

Or you can try to be opportunistic and think from the business perspective of growth 

Here’s the thing, you gotta start small & feasible. Stuff you understand 

Even “One up on Wall Street” by the great Peter lynch talks about starting with buying into companies that you understand 

You may have a ton of success investing locally, into something or someone you know. You may have a ton of failure too, but if you understand it, surely you can approach risks accordingly

I’m just saying it’s difficult to invest in these companies when you’re not some top dude like Warren buffet who could just send an email and schedule a meeting with the board of directors, ceo, coo, chief marketing officer, chief r&d, etc 

So because of that I find it difficult because you’re really investing in the people running it. Still, as of late, some things just keep going up 

In my opinion I flipping love real estate. Pun intended. I make crazy $ flipping from what I feel is natural to me and rentals are great as well, especially buying in cheaper areas that have good relative cashflow rates, like Cleveland / Akron metro, parts of Alabama, Indiana, especially if you can get a good fixer upper at a good price (like I just saw a duplex off market for $64k) 

Now the question is, do you even have money?! If so then let’s go get something setup, real assets are one way stocks are another, just gotta look deeply into the future of where your money is going. A house is nice cause you can drive by the streets. 

But you do not know how the sales managers in your invested companies are planning to tackle which exact issues, what data they’re using, what is holding them back, internal supply chain issues, etc. But you can walk in a house, see there’s a leak, and fix it",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSVY1RHh1cV9oLWpGYUx2TnZ4X01EazVTWWRmOGlUZVRTQjU3VVdUbVg3UF9ST20wdjhjMlp3ZndaYUE2bktHZE9DeWthSFVIVlEyMXRzWEY0dEZfUS1fVzVwTUp3WkJWRkY0UW1jcWZMTmM9

"Let’s go!! 

So hey man I went to a meetup called multifamily mindset as I’m in real estate & raise private money for a lot of deals 

Changed my entire mindset, the dude running it raises so much money, and has for years, he talks about it so casually that it’s easy to pick up the vibe he gives off to raise $$. 

I feel like I could raise $100k in a snap if I needed it for say a really good flip in Seattle for $600k and our downpayment needs to be $80k + fees or whatever. 

Currently my downpayments are only less than $20k, just to keep a simple model for my fund, but I plan to raise 50-100k at a time to be able to buy multiple flips at once, with a certain set underwriting criteria to be met for the funds to be released from escrow so everyone’s good and we make $ consistently

Here’s what’s been working for me lately, asking people what they do, listening to people, and a lot of people do just so happen to be around or interested in real estate. I met an investor at my $108/day 3 day stay hotel in Dallas (cheap for Dallas). 

I don’t “borrow money,” I ask if you if you’re looking into flips. If you are trying to get into it, I’ll help you out. I have resources from contractors to cheap materials, & good deal sources. As well as funding. So yes I would like to flip with you & you can get the downpayment on this deal, but let’s go above and beyond get involved with your investments, find another good deal, and I’ll raise the $ and we’ll partner on that one too 

I have a few really good friends of mine who happen to be investors and I try to keep the best deals in house for them, “growing my economy” in a way. Literally making my friend when I had nothing $30k+ on a deal we’re doing right now she lent me 15k and was always there even when I was a nobody

"Yeah I know a few people who have bought businesses. 

Bear in mind that you’ll generally need a lot more than 50K to do it. 

There are two approaches I would recommend. 

First - buy a franchise business or approach a franchise business whose owner is looking to retire and offer to work there as a general manager with the goal of buying their business. This is a good training ground for general operation management, which you’re going to need to be skilled in. 

Second - find a business whose owner is looking to retire and offer them a vendor finance deal. Basically, you buy their business but pay them off in instalments - and if you miss an instalment, they get to keep their business plus all the money you’ve paid them. 

The reason you do this is to remove all the risk for them, as most owners would prefer to just get a lump of cash instead. This makes your offer more compelling. 

If you do vendor finance, you can pay them back from the profits generated by the business itself. 

This is where having the operational management skills comes into play. Because if you know how to pull a few leavers to increase revenue and cut costs you can improve the profitability of an existing business fairly quickly. 

Many existing businesses are poorly run. I have a friend who likes buying hairdressing salons for example - because most of them are run by people who are good at cutting hair, not running a business. 

Then he usually raises prices, does some proper marketing, has a more systemised way for following up customers and reminding them to come back for a cut etc. 

And voila, he bought a business for very little upfront cash, and within 12 months it is generating substantially higher profits than previously. So he can cover the payments to the original owner and still generate a nice profit for himself.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQWFqTDJLb1lwZ2hGSk9xbGJRcGFqVU9LSVpLVEpZUE1mdXFLbWstZDhyQXpCc25RMkZlcGt6aWs2ZlUxZ2RLclNERS12bUZuZG5QakowdW9HVFlBVmVQNzNLSm1lcE11Tlc4Z1hHODMwTVE9

Sign some NDAs and start setting up meetings with the owners of businesses you're genuinely willing to buy. Some of these businesses don't even list the revenue and earnings because it's going to turn people away.

"A holding company is essentially a separate company used *to hold* assets and limit exposure. You need the companies to be separate to accomplish these goals. You can utilize separate companies to “fence off” different assets and exposure. When my wife opened her medical practice, she was required to use a professional corporation. I then set up two LLCs—one for staffing and one for equipment. When we bought a building, we used another LLC for it. 

The equipment LLC borrowed money to buy the equipment for the practice, (which required a personal  guarantee), which it then leased to the practice. The loan and the equipment lease comprised this LLC’s operations—which limits the chances that it’s going to be sued, which makes it (theoretically) a safe place to keep valuable assets.

The staffing LLC contracted with the practice for staffing, borrowed money to make the initial payroll and then billed the practice for staffing services. This didn’t hold assets, which made it a less likely target for lawsuits. 

An exercise I recommend when creating several interested companies is to do a Venn diagram with lines for contracts and payments between the companies. It can get complicated. 

Your question brings to mind a Series LLC, which has a “parent” LLC with “child” LLCs created under the parent, (with only the parent required to pay the filing fees). Series LLCs were created with property holding/management in mind, so that a company that held or managed several properties could operate each property as independent companies without having to set up each company. They are interesting, but the law was still undecided in some jurisdictions whether or not the child LLCs provided adequate protection.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZnFjODUxbWNrR1hlQWNRbG5GalNEVDdENFdEdDNZQnpjVG9PQnZSN0loMlRxQTBNNzh4dzd3TnpIRXZtbXB5NzlrVTV0WHN3LVdKb2Q2RGNFbUJiU2c9PQ==

"Well, I don't have $50k--100k for one. Or a refrigerated box truck, or CDL. Also, I'm not really mechanically inclined, and if you're just gonna be a dude with a box truck, maintenence will eat you alive if you bought an old crappy one and you're working with brokers, which can bring steady money but others are taking the lion share of it.


It being a sure fire successful business would really hinge on someone already being deep into running a transportation company who has the refrigerated space to hold stuff for a day or two while they sold as much as they could, whether that's a physical location or enough refrigerated trucks and lot space to park them until they could secure a buyer.


But it still is an opportunity. I've read stories about truckers banging on people's doors offering to sell at very very low cost rejected product because some of the boxes on a pallet were damaged during loading or a pallet tipped in transit.

"I raised prices at the same time everything was increasing due to short supply at the middle end of covid. We had shipping containers sitting in the ocean not able to get here. The retail products are made with commodities type raw goods so manufacturers or producers were increasing cost significantly which led me to think it was a good time to follow the pricing strategy that I used in my other business. I didn't change anything else but I did lose some key employees and now I pretty much can only afford myself and 1 employee and we offer really great customer service. I have customers pull me aside to compliment my employee. And me being customer focused my whole life, I know I give at minimum above average customer service. The segments or brands I've analyzed show the higher end product lines have remained stable or a bit down in sales. The main drop is in the middle cost brands. So I'm planning to aggressively market those brands with a return to proper retail pricing.

I agree I need to get out in front of the customer more but I'm usually pushing paperwork when I'm there so I don't get to see customers as much as I should.

"I'm not saying an accounting degree is a bad degree. It's a great degree if you want to become an accountant. Accountants are very useful. In my field, there are (generally) 4 professional pillars - law, econometrics/financial mathematics, accounting, and engineering. 

I wouldn't really call any of those options a generalist degree though. There are no generalist degrees anymore. The world is run by technical specialists. Nobody gets an accounting degree and then does engineering work (outside of maybe the software industry, where historically software developers didn't need degrees). But technical skills get you into technical industries, which is where the money and power are. And there's a lot of on-the-job learning where someone with a strong mathematical background can flex their way into other roles, to a degree. But it generally goes in one direction. The more technically specialized the work, the harder it is to get in. But you can move in the other direction more easily.

"So I would get in touch a LOT closer with your customers.

I would do a lot of phone work if you can. Have a list of questions, not that you sound like you are grilling them. Open ended questions giving them a chance to give expansive explanations. I've done this for clients, and have had great results getting information. I wouldn't depend on emails to get feedback, nothing beats directly calling clients. 

Maybe hire a college student to make these types of calls to customers to get feedback. 

>I can't decide if I offer a mea culpa on pricing to my customers to get them back or if it will hurt me further. 

It will hurt you further. No mea culpa. Instead, be positive. ""I can't believe it! Our suppliers' pricing has gone down and we are passing the savings back to you - pre-Covid pricing! Something like that. Positive spin on it.

However, I am a big believer that one should raise prices and that was a perfectly fine thing for you to do. HOWEVER, you have to add something that increases value. It can be tangible/intangible, or both. There are gardeners who charge $50 to cut one's lawn, or $150. For the same yard. But if the $50 company and $150 company are exactly the same, of course one will choose the $50. But if the $150 has nice clean uniforms (instead of tshirts and grubby jeans), trucks and equipment is glistening, communicates often, looks for and does little ""extras"" that the customer didn't know and does it free of charge, all these are ""extras"" that won't cost the company hardly anything extra. There are a lot more ""extras"" that a business can do with some imagination. I just made up these off the top of my head.

I know one pharmacy that I used to go to, they had a vibrating massage chair. I sat in that and just relaxed and didn't even want them to call my name for my prescription being filled. I could sit in that fucking chair for hours. I was HAPPY to wait for my prescription, while normally I abhor waiting. So why would I go to any other pharmacy??? 

What outrageous extra services and non-tangibles can you offer that you are not doing now? 

Maybe for the pushing paper, you hire a VA (virtual assistant), at least part time so that you can get in front of your clients to ask them questions. Sure, maybe you can't outsource some of the paperwork, but what paperwork *can* you outsource? You might say you can't, but think on it. Find a way to do this. Delegate the shit work.

The owner's main job in any company is marketing, not paperwork. And job #1 for you is to start intensely talking to your clients.

Just my opinion.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWFZXWDFFZXk4TzhuekRYd0xWNVRYelhNLW9EcFprWk1PdFlyQWJwdUtGd1F3eHV1TG50QjV0YnM5SC1vRnVGRjNwaFY1aHVBYTNXem1OTUs5bjUxbUE9PQ==

"Inventory control is crucial for your business. It helps you manage your costs, know what's selling well and what's not, and ensure you have enough stock to meet customer demand without overstocking.  
However, if your current business operations, especially the weekend garage sales, are relatively simple and don't involve a large volume or variety of products, a regular push-button cash register might suffice for now. But as your business grows, you might find that having an inventory tracking system becomes more necessary to stay organized and efficient.  
You could start by manually keeping track of your inventory for a while to see if it's manageable and then decide if you need to invest in a more sophisticated system.

A percentage would ensure that you continue to earn as the song gains popularity and generates more income.  
However, there are risks involved. It's possible that the song doesn't perform as well as expected and you end up earning less than the $1,000 upfront offer.  
If you decide to go for a percentage, make sure to have a clear and legally binding agreement outlining the terms of the profit-sharing.  
Ultimately, the decision depends on your risk tolerance and your assessment of the potential success of the song.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdWZjTGd3a0ZpT0ZIU3hZanFoUXhWaldhWWpIay1DbFBselVGY2V5ZTBQd25fV3Zac2FUSm1YS3l2SmpCQWh3NUFzamR0SEgwdU5PR1FFRkFWNldzOHc9PQ==

"Is this the same PG&E that before around 2000 they owned and operated powerplants. Which, of course they would because theyre a power company. But they decided they wanted to sell all of their power plants because it was just a cost sink, the state of California gave them permission to sell off half of their power plants. They ignored this and sold off all of them. Then, when they went to purchase power from other companies, they realized all of the rates had skyrocketed and they couldn’t do anything about it. They don’t know the status of a ton of their towers and electrical lines. Something like a third they have no idea what shape they’re in.  But that’s probably fine, it’s not like California has a fire problem.  It’s also not like they responsible for burning 1,500,000 acres.

">an American market with overseas labor.

Conversely, if tech companies, let's say Facebook and Google make the majority of their money outside of the United States (which they do), should they commit to US layoffs in order to more equitably hire in those foreign countries? So they're not ""able to double dip?""

WhatsApp engineering team in Menlo Park, CA has about 30-50 engineers at Meta running a global app with 2 billion users. Virtually none of the users are in the US. They generate money globally, which Meta pays corporate tax on in the United States, and which Meta employees pay federal income tax, state tax, sales tax, and a bunch of other taxes. And considering that a Meta staff software engineer averages $664k and a manager level 2 averages $1.23M (not even looking at the comp for higher level like principals, directors, or VPs) - that's a great deal for American workers and federal, state, and local governments.

>If they want to outsource, then they shouldn't be able to be headquartered in the US.

This is only fair if we ban outsourced knowledge work. Let's say the cure to cancer is found in Germany. Ban it, since it's unfair to American medical researchers.

Accountant here.  The $100K debt payoff has no bearing on your gain or loss from the sale.  The (very) basic formulas for gain or loss would be: 

Adjusted basis = Cost of Asset sold - depreciation allowed or allowable.

Gain/(Loss) = $120K - Adjusted basis.

Buy the Stock: If the stock drops to the set price, you buy it.

"It depends upon whether the sale is structured as an asset sale or a stock sale.

Most small business sales are asset sales.  Old owner (regardless of the form of entity) will sell all of the company's assets to new owner.  In that case, old owner keeps the debts, and pays them off with his share of the proceeds.

A stock sale generally applies to corporations.  In that case, the old shareholder sells his company stock to new shareholder.  The new shareholder then owns the entire corporation, including the company's debts.

"I helped a friend set one of these up a 8 years ago, sadly it closed down due to 3 long-as COVID lockdowns but it was doing well pre-covid. I didn't own it but thought I could share some insights.

Location is very important because there has to be good demand for dog daycares. My friend set up in the suburban area of a big city to avoid the city-center rent rates. We had to rent out a decently sized suburban warehouse and convert that into a dog daycare facility to save on rent  ( warehouse space is cheaper than retail space). It took a few thousand to get everything up and ready .

There was good demand in the area and the business was looking good when I looked at the 'books' for my friend on the odd occasion and gave advise.

Pros of running this business

* Can take multiple clients' pets at once
* Not too intensive
* Don't require much capital or specialized labor
* Can be fun to interact with animals
* Can be highly profitable, if there is high demand
* Don't have to deal with clients too much ( just see them for like 5 min at the start/ end of the day)

Cons of running this business

* Dealing with mess: Dog shitting/ pissing over stuff, chewing stuff up. Hair everywhere. Lots of cleaning
* Dealing with dogs fighting/ playing too rough
* Sometimes getting clients is hard ( especially when starting up)
* Noisy ( sometimes)
* Customers can be a pain sometimes
* Highish start up ( need to have secure pens, cleanable floor mats, equipment to clean( had to get a power washer to remove piss stains), employees to deal with dogs, clean, deal with customers. Rent/Utilities and other costs all can add up quite high.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRGxieDVuYi1WSkI4UE1xN3kta2ZMdk1Ld3NkMkhINUZhUkduNTVfXzFCQ2wzdEp3cE1KZ0tkcmV0dmx2ZUt1V202MW82ZVlhX2tSdDJuX3hyRDY1LWJTaHFncEJ1cmRRUkZFcU8wcjRfTkU9

"DON'T START A BUSINESS.

A business requires so many things to start, let alone manage. The most important are: time, knowledge, and money. There is an opportunity cost of starting a business-all that money and time can be used to further your studies/education. Which has a greater chance of getting you a higher paying job and providing better opportunities.



OP, you sound very naive. You want to start a business for 'blue-collar credits' that you 'think' you may need. You probably may not need them. A digital marketer is a white-collar job as well, so you clearly don't get basic business concepts.



If you can get credits at working at a fast food franchise. Why don't you?
.
1) You will be able to get traceable references from a boss and have a credible employment history.


.
2) Earn money to fund some of your studies/living in Europe. I assume your parents will fund your studies. Otherwise, it will be hard to go to Europe to study unless you have assets or get a loan( not advisable)


.
3) Develop soft skills and have experience working in a proper workplace that has a creditable name.

"Hi! I understand your situation. Dealing with social anxiety when starting a business can be challenging. One way to handle it is to prepare thoroughly before any business interactions. Know exactly what you want to say and have clear goals in mind. Also, start small and gradually expose yourself to more social situations related to your business. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing before meetings. Remember that most people are focused on the business matter at hand and not on judging you. It might help to view these interactions as opportunities to learn and grow rather than as stressful events.

"Starting a business is  exciting yet often equally overwhelming undertaking.

"Lean startup business plan and a Guided strategic direction

Imagine setting off on a cross-country adventure without a map or GPS. The journey would be riddled with uncertainty and missteps. That’s what it’s like to start a business without a plan.

A business plan helps guide your company’s strategic direction. Firstly, it clarifies your mission and vision, which together determine the overarching direction. Then, the business plan describes the specific business goals and objectives you hope to achieve and the strategies for doing so.

By charting out these specifics, the business plan acts as a continuous reference point for guiding your strategy. When faced with decisions, dilemmas or opportunities, you and other team members can refer back to this “map” to remind yourself of your core objectives and thus align your actions with them.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac2tHdzdxMlE2V0JiX2cwMW1WdXJIdHVIdnZTdFIzRWlMZlJiOGktWk5ZOTNacV9mWVd6RlRoR3dQTHZFRDBUSkpnX0hEdURpT19nWlIwOEY3TUN6YUNBQ29teC0zVDBMaWMyd2dwZUxWRlU9

"Over the past 40 plus years, there has been in shift in the public-private relationship. It started off with lobbying for deregulation. Then, it moved to regulatory capture. Then, it moved to lobbying for government money directly (subsidies, direct payments, etc). There is no where else to go in a democracy. Some want to rule, but that would not be popular/legal yet. So, they are lashing out, testing waters, etc.

With many execs, they are making millions of dollars like a movie star or pro basketball player, but they are getting way less likes and attention than average social media people. For many CEO types, that has gotta mess with your head.

Also, somehow we got the impression that these CEOs are managing social media themselves. Maybe they do write some tweets, but make no mistake, almost all of them have a PR team behind them. Portnoy has talked about firing social media managers who couldn't come up with social media stunts that produced engagement.

The other side is an audience that loves insane shit. I wonder if that has to do with how conservative culture has become.

Bullshit, but totally a claim one can make. Not that you have to, since you did nothing illegal to start with, but you can make it.

"You are not a company. The mailing list is a company asset. I can guarantee you the company has a value it ascribes to that mailing list and if it was stolen or otherwise leaked, they would use that appraisal to seek damages.

A company using an asset that has value to support a campaign is providing a service in kind. If that service is not reported, it's a campaign finance violation. If the service exceeds the amount you can legally donate to a campaign, it's a violation. The fact that the GOP broke the FEC and made it largely incapable of enforcement does not change the fact that these are violations of campaign finance law.

David Pecker was given immunity for this exact crime to testify against Trump in New York (providing an in kind service to Trump without reporting it). 

>One it is protected speech, but two, if I am doing it as a CEO, I can claim it is just PR and branding for my company.

You need to learn a bit about the first amendment. Companies sending political messages to their commercial mailing lists is corporate speech, not protected 1st amendment speech.

You absolutely cannot ""claim it is just PR and branding"" when you are explicitly endorsing a candidate and providing a service that has a known market value. PR would be you going to the New York Times and personally endorsing Trump. Using company assets to do so makes it a donation from the company.",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUHVYYTV2M0I0UHRNcWMwN3pNcDVtRl9SVXBjbFd4WGMzeDBnT213dTl1b2E3UkZWeHM4SjVNWmk2bGtjUEF4dkY1T1JtYVlEQVFFTjJmVkRhZ0syd1VhN0hUdWZKbUt4ejBoWHhLcjR1UU09

Miami is also rapidly becoming a huge tech hub. While it's true that a lot of the growth Florida has seen comes as a result of the baby boomers moving down here, it's unwise to assume it's the sole reason Florida is absolutely thriving. Even manufacturing in Florida is growing! Between 2014 and 2022, the GDP for manufacturing increased to $73 billion, which is pretty impressive.  
[Report: Florida manufacturing is booming, rivals tourism | Business Observer (businessobserverfl.com)](https://www.businessobserverfl.com/news/2024/apr/15/florida-manufacturing-booming/)

Aerospace and Aviation is growing at fantastic speeds as well, as many other industries such as biotech, pharma, etc. Florida is much more than a 1 trick-pony and though Baby Boomers moving down here has certainly helped catapult Florida's GDP growth, it is far from being the sole reason. As we continue to grow, I expect more and more people to want to move down here, and I am all for it!",r/business,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRThTNkN6aHBXUlFCWFJuTTJPVkpnTTZsWFlOQ3JTWVlBeHF5MG5fRkhCal96NWp2RFF1WkRZSUFJMVkxeWNXRlFLTEd4UV9zU0pnQjJGczN1dF9CRGc9PQ==
