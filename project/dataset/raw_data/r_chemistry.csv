Probably most relevant for you is that any source of chlorine will decrease the solubility of your salt (due to the common ion effect, think back to Le Chatliers principle). De ionised water is probably best.

As for how clear the solution is, that largely depends on how much light is scattered through it.

"Can you respond this counter-argument I'm assessing from Chat-GPT 4o?

> Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is indeed used as an electrolyte salt in many lithium-ion batteries. However, the primary forms of lithium within a lithium-ion battery are indeed found within the anode (typically graphite intercalated with lithium) and the cathode (such as lithium cobalt oxide, LiCoO2, or other mixed metal oxides). Thus, the bulk of lithium in such batteries is not in the form of LiPF6 but within these electrode materials.

"Also, any comments on this exchange about the danger of introducing water (from ChatGPT 4o):

>The recommendation to avoid using water on a lithium fire is due to the fact that lithium reacts violently with water, producing flammable hydrogen gas and heat, which can exacerbate the fire. This would be true regardless of the specific lithium compounds present in the battery.

Me: ""regardless""? I find this suspect.

>ChatGPT 4o: You're right; the specific chemistry of lithium compounds in batteries can play a role. However, the key point is that lithium metal itself reacts with water.

>While lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is used as a salt in the electrolyte of lithium-ion batteries, the guidance to avoid water on lithium fires primarily relates to the behavior of lithium metal. When water contacts lithium metal, it produces hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide, both of which can worsen the fire.

>Additionally, in the presence of lithium hexafluorophosphate, water can indeed lead to the formation of hydrofluoric acid (HF), which is hazardous.

"I started with undergrad research when I asked my advisor about a paid summer research opportunity my school had for sophomores and he replied, ""That's a good opportunity, but I think you'll get more and better experience working in my lab more. If you write up an article about the work for the school's undergrad research journal, you'll get $1200.""

The other opportunity paid more, but I hung out with my classmates doing that one and it seemed really... boring.

I never really stopped working with that professor until he left after being denied tenure. Then I ended up working the same lab with his replacement. And then I got a job making $65k/yr before the graduation ceremony happened and ended up missing it because I was working.

By the way, this is what people mean when they say your job search starts in your sophomore year. You can start laying the groundwork in both experience and networking this early.

I know I was hella lucky to have an advisor pitch me the offer. You will probably need to start looking up your professor's research topics and reading their articles. Then you can ask them when a good time would be to talk to them for help understanding what the big confusing words mean. Professors generally love to talk about their chosen topics.

"Solubility depends on the substance to dissolve and on what other suff is in solution, so also pH for example. I would avoid tap water for a multitude of reasons and stick to distilled or deionized water.

Boiling the water off can cause reactions that can introduce impurities. If you boil the water off to dryness, all of those will stay in the material. Once you reach a point when there is almost no water left, the temperature of the slurry can reach much, much higher temperatures and decomposition can occur. Do not boil to dryness over an open flame or stove. 

It is better to slowly evaporate at only slightly higher temperatures, and continuously remove the escaping water, either in a vacuum or by ventilation. For large amounts, this is very slow.

Another option would be to carefully evaporate until crystallization first occurs and then precipitate your product by adding a solvent that is miscible with water but doesn't dissolve the product, for example Acetone or if you're lucky isopropanol. Then you filter the slurry through a coffee filter and carefully press off the solvent, then leave it out to dry at roomtemperature. This introduces flammability risks and can introduce impurities from the solvent if you buy crap, so only do that with some knowledge of what you're doing. This may provide and additional cleaning effect if done right, but at the loss of yield, depending on how much water was left.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTVdMUS0zbWc5c2VheDhkWHB3ZVFpcC16SlNhMURvU2FRcS1ad1BUeEVRQUZ4R3BFdEhaMU1PTU9zTW9xLVNTei0ybnUwZ3REY2tmeHZJUzRobTM2SUR2emFfQzFnU0M4ak9oeEhVbVM1OEU9

People that can’t maintain a basic log of inventory and fill out a single line of handwritten writing on a paper when they take a bottle of reagents or the last pack of falcon tubes.

80% of chemists don’t understand basic principles and can’t follow explicit instructions. They try to experiment on the fly and don’t know how to control variables or design a basic experiment. 

And they can’t take criticism on any level, even incredibly constructive criticism.

They’ll handle chemicals without gloves, never wear lab coats, wear open toed shoes, not report spills or injuries, bring food or drink into labs… I could go all day.

">I thought you start numbering on an R group of interest and then move the shortest number of carbons to the next R group.

I don't understand what you're trying to say here.

In any case, it doesn't matter. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry has decided on the numbering system for fused ring systems (P-25.3.3.1.1):

>The numbering of peripheral atoms in the preferred orientation starts from the uppermost ring in the upper right quadrant. If there is more than one uppermost ring the ring furthest to the right is chosen. Numbering starts from the nonfused atom most counterclockwise in the ring selected and proceeds in a clockwise direction around the system, including fusion heteroatoms but not fusion carbon atoms. Each fusion carbon atom is given the same number as the immediately preceding nonfusion skeletal atom, modified by a Roman letter ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,

"There are a few things I would say are wrong here.

1) % Transmittance Vs. Absorbance. Wiley is showing absorbance (amount of Infrared light utilized by bonds at a given wavelength) while you are showing % Transmittance in your graph (amount of light passed through the sample), which is the typical way organic chemists look at FTIR data. Your conversion may be incorrect depending upon the settings for the FTIR as other forms of measure do exist each with slight augmentations to the output data. (Kubelka-Munk, Transmittance, absorbance, reflectance, ...)

2) Wiley is a pretty poor source for FTIR data, as unless you pay for their services, you often receive a single peak (often in the fingerprint region) at the most intense point(not the most useful point). Realistically, there should be far more peaks than this singular peak in your compound, even in the fingerprint region. 

3)Realistically, the only times you see true IR invisible compounds is when you have diatomic elements such as oxygen and nitrogen, or perfectly symmetrical organic compounds with nonabsorbing groups (acetylene and ethylene). 99% of the time, organic compounds always have some absorbance to be seen. So I would expect to see CH bonds, Si-C, Si-O,N-H, and N-C bonds. 

$) What is your ATR prep procedure? Do you properly clean the ATR crystal and press between samples? Have you visually inspected the surface between samples? I suspect, based on the lack of CH2 peaks and general lack of compound-associated peaks, that the background was taken with a sample present, subtracting a from all of the expected peaks.

5)It appears your IR instrument observed a change to the amount of CO2 present between the background and the actual sample. This isn't a big issue for personal use but can be quite a nuisance if you attempt to publish with FTIR spectra, as the ""negative"" peak should not occur. There are instrument techniques that can be taken to control this but is not necessary if you are reporting only peak positions and not full spectrum data.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWllicmx5aDdzejNwSUJzYWVSemYtUmNjaUk0RkJ2YlU1TjNtTkdpcndMNTJiZ0MtR2d4aHNkNkRNRjhja0FJQVpVRlktb3B5Ykc5S2NOYngxUmZoeXc9PQ==

"No problem FTIR is a beast of a technique when you get into the nitty-griddy of all the possible controls that can be taken care of with the instrument. 

Additionally, Transmittance isn't just the term utilized for the Y axis of the output data. Transmittance FTIR can be taken when you take an IR invisible salt and a portion of your sample and compress it to make windows for the IR to transmit through.  ATR (Attenuated Total Reflectance) contains additional mirrors compared with Transmittance experiments since the beam is technically displaced from the original path up to the back end of the crystal so that it can be reflected towards the detector. Opus settings can be adjusted between collection units to give you the data you want for each experiment. 

One way you can ensure that the data you are collecting is sound is by doing a step-by-step approach. It's a little time-consuming, but you can take a background with any preferred setting (Absorbance, transmittance, et cetera. Absorbance being easiest for doing math in Excel before conversion) and take sample measures several times with that same background. Take a sample of the air (nothing on the crystal to prove a good background is being taken), the slide you wish to use (to prove that the slide allows for clean ATR analysis) a known compound with clean FTIR peaks (methanol or isopropanol are great choices since they are dirt cheap and have nice clean FTIR spectra when performed correctly) and then finally your sample.  With absorbance, so long as you don't change things between steps, you can subtract the values from each other and receive the same effect as blanking with the instrument.

Now you don't have to do this every time you run FTIR but this will be strong evidence for if your spectrometer is giving accurate data and that your approach can produce excellent data.

It still remains to be seen whether they are actually useful.

"Various metal salts aren’t soluble in acids under the wrong conditions.

So the answer to your question is no.

An example from my own area. If you add aqueous HF to a solution of rare earths in HCl or HNO3, you precipitate MF3. The only reliable way to redissolve them is by boiling in boric acid. They aren’t notably soluble in other aqueous acids.

As for the slow formation, that’s not really pertinent to what the compound might be. Various metal salts only look certain ways with certain degrees of hydration. 

At the end of the day, you added an inorganic acid to a metal and eventually ended up with a solid which looks very similar to the salt of the inorganic anion and the primary metal ion you had. I think this is a pretty simple case. The organic acid present maybe changed things a little.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZVhMTEJ0VkdXWFRFUFczT1phZ1ZOSi13NTUxZEREWEVheWhxZmxzdndMandDNy1sdlBXdEVOMmp5Y2ZyZk1yMFpHcUlOMEJMOS1kcDhXNWtHRVZfTHc9PQ==

"everyone in my lab wears jeans and t-shirts, no matter gender. i would wear crop tops / tanks to school and just change into a t-shirt before hand. the labcoat covers the rest. 

your school might have a dress code for lab wear like mine does. mine does curiously allow skirts / dresses as long as they reach the ankle. 

personally i would never wear long sleeves in a lab. if you spill something on yourself, tight fitting or not, you'd have to pull it off and the fabric would keep the chemical in contact with your skin longer. a lab coat is easy to rip off, a shirt is not. (of course you'd have to rinse for at least 15 mins anyway, but might as well be able to keep your shirt on). also, i've gotten stuff on the cuffs of my gloves and it would get onto my labcoat sleeves. better the school labcoat than my personal shirt that i'd wear home and expose other things too.

In many places safety just gets ignored to a frightening degree. There’s one lab with an extraction that requires like 100ml hexane and some toluene as well. Since they don’t have much time there they don’t use the solvent dispensers and instead just use the large chemical bottle. Lots of splatter, many puddles in the fume hood and the workers there often reach into the fume hood with their entire upper body. 

Once asked one of them if the smell doesn’t make them worry since it was so strong even in front of the fume hood and they just said “smell? I don’t smell anything”. 

They also handle toluene like water, washing glass ware with it, using it without a fume hood and gloves etc. 

In another lab were they handle oleoresin (pepper extract) one girl got some on their hands and washed it off with methanol from the barrel, right on her hands, from a barrel with no drain below so it just ended up on the floor fuming away.

I agree. When we started IT lessons at our chemistry bachelor our school issued laptops ran on windows and we were told to keep it that way. The rest of the science campus had linux but I'm told chemistry is the exception because our softwares don't perform well outside windows. Macs were a rarity used by brand loyalists and people who cared more about aesthetics and imaginary social credit than function. Also anything by Apple is notoriously annoying to fix if it breaks and the school didn't want to deal with that since they were responsible for maintenance of the laptops.,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZNThUdEFVQnZHcTFoYTMtSTlUc0RSTTRGcnlueHloX3VhU0NqeDFrYW56ZFlFZTlTY1IxQno1c3drbE1FQ1RZVEZSSTA5MndHQVFCVTAzbVdETkwxdVE9PQ==

"Come to Burlington, Iowa (beautiful little town right on the Mississippi) and work with us at MoM (Masters of Molecules). We're the R&D lab for 3-time Inc 5000 company [BiOptimizers.com](http://BiOptimizers.com) .   
  
Our current Lab Lead came to us as a walk-in, formerly a Vet Tech, with a degree in Ag Science. Totally unrelated to what we do (compounding organic chemistry). She kills it!  
  
We also have a Robotics Division doing diverse tech for automation and some Biohacking hardware/software solutions. Our lead in robotics left a much larger company to come play in an a truly innovative environment, with a chance to spread his wings and tap into a much broader knowledge and development base.

We also have a full scale lab with 21 PhD's/PhD Candidates at Burch University in Bosnia. And we're building a DNA/RNA research facility in Bosnia.

If you can find a decent BiO tech center (Boston/San Fran/Des Moines/Chicago/Atlanta/Austin), you can likely find a startup who will gladly accept you as a (paid) intern. 

The benefit? Not only do you get more elbow room in the lab. You may also find the path from academia to employment much shorter.

"You are not doing this at home, considering that boron melts in the same temperature range as most common ceramics, maybe higher. Blowtorches are also probably not as hot as you imagine they are, the temperature of the hottest part of the flame being in excess of the melting point is quite different from the flame actually being able to heat a bulk object to said temperature, particularly in an open environment. 

If you really want this to work, you would likely need to invest in a tube furnace, and an extremely high end one at that. I am drawing a blank on what material the crucible could be constructed of, all the common materials like alumina, quartz, stainless steel etc would melt before boron. Maybe graphite or some kind of tungsten alloy?

"Idea is good. In practicality - say you take a bucket and fill it with water, place it next to you and for example take a jug that you would fill up from the larger container(the bucket) and use that jug to pour water on what ever you are holding in your other hand. Theres a few problems. First... As the pile of dishes grows(it doesn't even have to be that many) you find yourself in a situation where you have to keep getting up and refilling that bucket potentially even several times. You would be surprised of the amount of water that goes down the drain from a longer dish washing session if you choose the open tap rinsing option. I say that because even in a normal household situation there are alternative methods for rinsing dishes. Second, it is quite time consuming. Rinsing each item by pouring water over it. If you step it up and drop being shy you ad to first problem. The bucket gets empty fast. In a remote scenario imo a more practical solution is to take a container with clean water and simply place the dishes in that container... Once the water gets soapy replace it.

" Boron has a very high melting point of 2077°C. Only the very hottest, oxygen-fed blowtorch would reach that. And even with that it is questionable how well can you do indirect heating of dust in a dish, since much heat is bound the escape.

"Food contact materials scientist here.


The answer is no.


The transfer of substances from a plastic food contact material follows the Fick law of diffusion - migration depends of concentration of a given substance, the type of polymer and time and temperature of contact. 


Given that any substance from the bucket will have to
1) Migrate from the bucket to the water you are using to clean your dishes. You are likely to use room temperature water rather than hot water - that would greatly slow migration.
2) Get absorbed by the real FCM you will use (a plate, for example) - as with the previous case, absorption is unlikely to happen in any meaningful way at room temperature if in contact for less than a minute.
3) Migrate from the real FCM to food - if only minute amounts have been absorbed, migration will be very low.

Definitely not a stupid question! Water has a lot of favorable properties for cleaning things. As others have mentioned it's referred to as the universal solvent. It's a polar solvent so it'll dissolve polar molecules or compounds that dissociate in water (like ionic compounds). It's extremely safe to use for cleaning since it's non toxic and can't really hurt us unless we get a lot of it someplace it shouldn't be (like our lungs). On top of that it's extremely abundant on our planet so outside of a few areas it's readily accessible.,r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR0w0dVFtZDZmTHVRWnVua1VKcllGWkwwaXo4Z2dZS1lvR0U0NkVSTl8xaUpaLUg1ZHNTUDBNWnFxUnY5eURPNGVlYU1lTFhud2pneUgxd2VPVjlad2c9PQ==

"The Printed Wiring part is very interesting. Printed Wiring Board is another name for Printed Circuit Board, i.e. PCBs.

Printed Wiring Boards in the early years may not have had any copper on them at all, but have been a paper-phenol or other material with holes where electronic components were fitted, and the legs bent, or with wiring attached underneath.

Paper Phenol laminates with copper that was electro deposited, or roll annealed, would be die punched and etched with a copper pattern on.

Fibre Glass began to replace Paper Phenol although Paper Phenol remained very popular for mass production consumer goods for some time, and can still be found in use.

If you want to find out more about the early PCB fabrication in the UK you should look up Dr Paul Eisler, Rex Rozario, and Technograph. Note though that this will be about commercial PCB production.

"Unfortunately not much self-guided study will help.  Most of the training is expensive and only open to corporate customers.

My advice is to take advantage of what is available now and think about refocusing those little 1% efforts.  Method development, formulation, customer complaints, procurement, scale-up/manufacturing are all valuable skills to showcase.

Specialist equipment training from a supplier such as a 1-3 day course.  Downside: really expensive and only companies pay (usually when they buy new equipment).  Informal hands-on training is nice too but you need to back that up with examples.

Formal training in any quality management system.  GMP/GLP, ISO-anything.  Usually 3 levels: user, manager and auditor.  Informal on-the-job training is okay for the ""user"" side.

Regulatory compliance.  This is anything legal. Department of Transport or International Maritime Organization gets deep into how to properly read and generate an SDS.  Cosmetics has the unique INCI nomenclature, but you also have labeling and packaging regulations.  Drop tests or challenge tests are an example.

RCRA or waste classification.  It's a nice skill to see.  US corporate employers are required to train all staff that generate chemical waste.  Having it skips some hurdles and makes you an ""easier"" hire.

Project management / risk management.  You really need formal training to be worth anything because they are so common.

"You have a lot of work ahead of you.  IMHO throw them away and buy new joints.

Two different types of chrome:

* Electroplated original pieces such as chrome bumper on a car

* Spray paint that with a pigment that looks shiny

You have the second.  It's ordinary spray paint that contains glossy shiny metal-looking pigments.

Your substrate already rusting is a problem.  The rust will continue underneath the new paint.

What you need to do is use a needle gun / sander to grind away as much of the surface rust as possible.  Then you apply a ""rust converter"" which is a chemical treatment to remove those final last traces.  It doesn't work on big bulk items, only the top few microns.  

Then you can paint it.

For hinges you can remove them from the frame and shutter, then soak them overnight in any commercial rust remover liquid.  Take the freshly clean and shiny hinge, scrub it with a stiff nylon or soft metal brush, then paint it with primer or all-in-one metal paint, then topcoat with a clear coating (probably something marine).

"> mordant... no set definition

Chemical that opens up the fibre to allow the dye inside.  

You can think of it like a pry bar opening up a locked door, lets the pigment inside, then you remove the mordant and the doors locks behind.  It can be acid/base, oxidizer/reductant, salt/non-salty or unique chemistry for that fibre.

Example of denim.  It takes about 40 dye/wash/re-dye cycles to get the dye to penetrate into the fibre sufficient to appear blue.  Even after all of that it still doesn't fully penetrate the fibre, nor the back (look at the inside of jeans versus the outside).  That's annoying and time consuming.

What we would love is a *mordant* that makes the pores in the cotton fibre open up, or just temporarily modify the chemical properties of the cellulose enough for a dye to penetrate.  However, that mordant cannot destroy the fibre or react with the dye, and we need to be able to remove it so you don't lose the dye at first washing or food stains become permanent too.  Which is difficult to do.

Potassium bichromate is a super strong oxidizer.  It's going to start to destroy the cotton, really fast.  You will want a slower oxidizer and air is fine for that.

You want the ""neutral"" gall to penetrate as far into the fibre as possible.  Then you want to introduce a soluble iron species into that fibre.  Only then do you want to introduce oxygen.  You want those two neutral chemicals to be as far inside the fibre as possible.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeFozS3htemhXdVBybjhSU3A4YllJd2lQRXJCNENmRV96SklheEw1NGZRWEROekJiTEQ3c0w5aVRqVGZ0aURjSTFvd3pHczBlSTVtZ1pZbE5laUhQNHc9PQ==

"In terms of chemistry, its the dipole moment of the molecule. Water has a dipole of 1.8, meaning it pulls to one side due to the forces within water, hydrogen bonding being a strong one. 
In short, other molecules with a strong dipole will tend to want to mix with water,  and this makes it a good solvent. 
Molecules without much of a dipole like oils don't want to mix with water, and for those you need solvents with low dipole, like Hexane (about zero). 

In short, when determining if two will mix in terms of chemistry look at the dipole moment value (that doesn't mean will won't react though!).",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaMDZiQUU4R0h4TmlXb3FndU5tbUVFVTRhRGpiX28zcmJ0SldnbXlFZDY5SHdqbVRISUlfMElXcUFPZi1BTGZBYjd4UFRZcXZCQjVQUmdVaVlxeHZOWEE9PQ==
"Fun read.  Thanks.

You re-invented one industrial method to make synthetic jarosite, goethite, magnetite (the black / rust blue).  Here is [one random publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250271637_Synthesis_of_Iron_Oxide_Using_Ferrous_and_Ferric_Sulfate) I Googled, may be a bit too academic for a casual reader.

By tuning the water temperature and the concentration of the ferrous sulfate, you preferentially make one of a mixture of those three.  Higher temperatures mean you get large crystals of black magnetite, which forms a smoother layer (for you, less heating/cooling/grinding cycles).

Historical bluing is aiming to get some iron metal into the water, then have that dissolved iron react with the metal substrate to form a new crystal on the surface.  The rust + bare metal combined to form a new layer on the surface.

Analogy: scraping some cake icing from the top to patch the sides.

What you did was skip all that and put the dissolved iron in via ferrous sulfate and you saturated it (you observed the precipitate).  

Get down <0.5% ferric sulfate and you move the reaction more towards goethite (orange) or jarrosite.

Majority of your suggestions would be fun home experiments.  The important chemistry concepts are concentration, temperature and time.  All your ideas start to manipulate those in uncontrolled ways.  IMHO you most likely start to make mixtures of different rust oxides.

"Final year student, you want to start applying for internships and ""professional development programs"" which start recruiting somewhere around mid-semester 1.

All those big companies you mentioned, look on their website at the *Work with Us* or *Careers* section.  They have annual graduate intakes but they start recruiting in your final year.  They will also be at career fairs.  Your school may have a person whose job is industry-academic collaboration, they will have a list too.  Note: these programs are extraordinarily competitive and can be national.

Locally, have a look where previous graduates from those academics groups are now working.  Those big pharma companies you mention - they recruit from only a handful of groups.  If your school doesn't have those, bad luck.  Life is now a little bit harder than students at other schools.

>  I know that I need to work an entry-level position in industry or at a law firm for a year or two to increase the strength of my grad school application

No, you don't.  Most likely that will have close to zero impact on your grad school application.  Grad school is 100% educational training.  The best evidence you can complete advanced educational training is... your undergrad educational training.  Work experience almost never is relevant (unless you get really lucky, in which case why do the PhD at all if on-the-job is superior).  IMHO you should work for a year to earn some money and take a break from study for the first time in your life.  Even at the best schools (not necessarily highest ranked) only 50% of the starters will complete grad school, for good reasons too.

Fruit changes ripeness because of ethylene gas.  As it ages it naturally releases that gas, which causes other nearby fruit to ripen at the same time.

Best method to preserve fruit is fridge temps and put it slightly under vacuum or just get lots of fresh air pumping through the container to dilute away the ethylene gas.

A really cheap method to do this at home is with dry ice.  Throw a handful of pellets into your container.

"Dude those tanks are nowhere near enough gas to purge a box. 8 grams of nitrogen is about 1 gallon in volume. The box will need to be at least a half a gallon (if not larger in volume) to hold enough fruit to justify its existence (this is a lot of effort and cost to preserve 2-3 apples, I assume you want this to save money by buying in bulk or while on sale). To get oxygen down to a low level for say a 0.5 gallon container, you will need several gallons worth of nitrogen gas. There’s nothing that prevents the incoming nitrogen from displacing nitrogen and leaving behind the oxygen (effectively doing nothing but waste nitrogen). So you will need a big flush of gas to get all of the oxygen out. Essentially, the problem is more complex than you think. A simple addition of a small amount of N2 isn’t going to magically force all the O2 out. It’s going to take way more than those cartridges can supply. If it’s not completely air tight (which is what you seem to be suggesting), oxygen will constantly be diffusing back into the container. A completely airtight seal or a constant positive pressure would be required to maintain low O2. As another person pointed out, you need to be mindful of ethylene gas. Sealing fruit in an airtight container might make them ripen and go bad more quickly since they are trapped in there with the ethylene. Lots fresh fruit packaging has air holes for a reason.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeW9GZjZBcmpYVWp1T1dnOU05XzR6Slo2dEFtUXJvUHBlcExPdlRXR3JWSEtWVGdYQldzWUV5UlF2YkZQX0t1c3BBNXROSnowdkZMYzRCcFlaNk5ObFE9PQ==

"Hi from a soon to be chemistry graduate. I took AP chem in high school and had the exact same excitement about experiments, labs, and wanting to learn how everything works and exists. I started majoring in chem but then suppressed these feelings and switched to majoring in engineering because it would bring in more money. I suffered and struggled through for two years, hating school and losing my passion for learning. After a ton of inner turmoil, I decided to follow my instincts and switch back to chem and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. I need to work hard to understand the concepts, but I love it beyond belief. I tell you all of this so that you don’t make the same mistake I did- listen to your gut. Do what will make you happy and what you hope to do long term, not what will bring in the most money. In the end, you are the one who has to spend all that time learning material so you might as well make it material that you enjoy. My advice is to just do a ton of practice problems when your teachers/professors give you them. Repetition and rewriting notes helps me understand the concepts better. Also, the job prospects for a chemist are enormous. Everyone needs a chemist. Most BS jobs fall under analytical chem which leans towards quality control and analysis but PhD chemists do research and figure out “how” things work.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaR1RudTJTUlNSM0gtLXJETUdFOW9PVnh5NGZ4aUJQdkNLNU56QmxUX3J0RHptUXZNSFE3c19pWVloMXBteGhDSnZZRUYxRExwNlB4SnV3Ym9EZmxCT1E9PQ==
"Do both. AI-training is big in the field of chemistry at the moment. An IT + mathematics degree with a minor in chemistry will get you a job quick. 

That said, if you want money, a degree in the sciences and an MBA will get you a lot more for less work. I love chemistry, but if I could go back in time I'd get an MBA and just grit my teeth so I could get 6 figures instead of capping out at mid-high 5s (they expect you to change jobs/go to a new company every couple of years- I have no idea why they don't just match inflation and retain their people, but I guess that's why I'm not an MBA). 

As far as getting better at chemistry, just make sure to keep your units in mind. Whatever you do to the numbers you have, make sure you keep track of what unit you're in at the current step and what you've done to the numbers you have. I really can't explain just how important it is keeping track of the units of all your calculations.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZ2Y4a202dFJBUHROdWpETTQyM0psY0J3N21MZ0hFRURKS25TUHU3T2dZNU11cGt2MXhkYUdiU2FXaXc2TEZFa3hhSUZ6R0dyTVluc1lja1pSMV8tN0NiZW45Zk9ydDJKTGJabEtmMmpHYlU9

"Hey I'm a chemistry graduate and now I'm pursuing masters in biosciences.

🤣🤣🤣

It honestly depends on 
1. where you are located and where you're planning to study(your country and the city of choice) 
2. Scope in the field in YOUR country and abroad and whether you're financially supported by your parents 
3. Whether you're the only child or have siblings. Whether you're family oriented or not. Whether you have the patience and tolerance. 

This field(up till graduate) requires a lot of patience since it'll be long lab hours and when I say LONG I MEAN LOOOOONNGG and there's a lot of repetition along with the duration that will definitely make you give up at some point. 
After graduation, if you're willing to go further studies, you really need even more patience since in most universities you'll have to go through entrance tests or interviews and competition gets tougher bec more than practical skills, you'll be heavily reviewed on theoretical skills. 

To be more efficient in lab work, you need to be patient and keep repeating and revising for accuracy and precision 

For the theory part, you need to memorize a lot and understand few concepts, rest are just memorization. Better to use mnemonics or flash cards or other such DIY methods which ONLY you can do it for YOURSELF.

"It depends on where you live and what kind of chemicals you want to buy. But with a few exceptions (e.g. sulphuric acid in the EU, and certain drug precursors just about everywhere) most reagents can be bought by anyone.



It's just that most companies don't want to take responsibility by selling chemicals to random people. So some specific substances are nearly impossible to get. 



But apart from that, you're putting yourself at extreme risk if you try to do this. Unless you've got some previous training and a well-equipped lab.  In this video you can find out where to get chemicals:

"If the pH was only caused by OH- ions from a strong base) (like in NaOH), you would need something in the ballpark of 2.3 mg of 85 % m/m phosphoric acid to neutralize 2 mL of sol. to pH 6.

I neglected that it is a trivalent acid, but at pH 6, most of the phosphate is H2PO4- so this should be fine +/- 10 %

I also assumed m/m to make my life easier which introduces a similiar error.

But now the bad news: If your firmulation contains other anions then OH-, none of those guestimates matter.

You would need to find out the total amount of basic anions in the formulation and add about that many moles of phosphoric acid.

You will always have to actually measure the resulting solution in the end.

1 kg of a saturated NaHCO3 solution of pH 9 for example takes about 120 g of pure phosphoric acid to completely neutralize. A NaOH solution of pH 9 would only take one mg of pure phosphoric acid.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaRk9yenYtREREVXBXTklZSFF6WEEwNWgzMEZJYnkzZVlUT2Z1bFJGTzdVNEZHTTg3VnhvTUt1MmtzRUhXeGlDS0RKMTRDdHNDczFnbERlV1lXbENMTVRidWdmdktBYS1OTGstUEpRT0k5cDQ9

"What kind of paint, and for what purpose?

Edit: Until OP provides *any* evidence to the contrary I am wholly unconvinced that someone with the chemical knowledge and experience required to synthesize dyes and manufacture paint independently would be asking this question... and that is giving no consideration to the question of equipment/facilities to do so safely. That sort of project would be extraordinarily complex, unnecessarily expensive, and hazardous all throughout. I can't think of a single realistic reason to attempt a ""total synthesis of paint"" as OP is suggesting. Plus the list of ""common chemicals"" OP chose to mention is especially shady.

OP — I encourage you to shut my skepticism down handedly. Forgive my cynicism but it feels like nine times out of ten that someone with no post history indicating expertise (DO NOT LOOK AT OP's POST HISTORY.

"So to clarify the situation, when the practical course touches the end, students are asked to clean up the glassware they used (which they should do anyways as it is part of the training). A date when the integrity and cleanness of the glassware is checked with assistants is also given at the very beginning of this course. As a matter that of facts, all other students were there on that date to check out of the lab (that wasn’t the case of the author of this post…). His glassware wasn’t washed and contaminated with chemicals (not droplets of water), which represents a potential hazard for the group of students that come in the next round. 
This is not a case of a tutor not liking him or anything like that, only of respect towards the rules and others.

"1. r/comp_chem is what you want 

2. Python is always a good choice for a beginner. Many software suites run with Python scripting and the language will teach you everything you’d need to know about programming from a conceptual standpoint. 

3. Computational chemistry is an extremely vast and esoteric field. “How to apply that kind of knowledge to my field of work” is way too broad of a statement. You’ll need to do some research into computational methods in order to narrow down the set of tools you wish to learn and apply. If you plan on doing this at your job or in another program, just learning the basics of coding by yourself should be a good start.

4. You will also want to keep-up on your physical chemistry. Many software packages are somewhat black-box in nature, but you’ll still need to know what’s going on (I.e. you get a result and you’ll need to know how to interpret it.

From what i read in that wiki, the tanh(x) function is actually related to the logistic function so i guess we are both on the right path lol.

He gave me ~100mL of Toluene which they used as a solvent and also so that the paint doesn’t become too thick. He gave me 250mL of Glycerine which he said helps to make the paint thick and make it retain it’s moisture.

I hope that satisfies your questions, I have proof too if you want.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVklsOGZCZUQ0MDBMVWpNZ2dKS011S2laLUduMWFQZVdVeE9jRkpINnhWbTQyejNoM1R2RGYzc2p2SWNUWE9rblo5WkVhRHVmWktNMVJQVmp1emVBWEhZT00xSVBRRWpla215UkJLOURpMUU9
"100% agree with the comments to start with python. It has a manageable learning curve and a powerful array of libraries to perform all manner of computations, analysis and visualisation.

Some people suggest computational chemistry, but this will require a lot of investment in understanding the underlying physical chemistry which is heavy on maths. Also, the algorithms have been optimised by computer scientists so you won't be doing a lot of coding for the computationally heavy bits, rather than using other people's software. That said, it is always useful to be able to write python scripts to interface between bits of software, parse output files or help with analysis.

While the comp chemistry route is useful for understanding the physical properties of molecules and their intermolecular interactions, there is also to bioinformatics side of things which cover a vast array of topics which can link in with the biology of disease, mechanisms of action, PK/PD modelling etc...

Either way, having both computational abilities as well as chemical/medicinal knowledge and skill will be very useful if, down the road, you wish to move to industry.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeXVmZlpsNGxLVGptbk53RVNkNjdZZUY4YVc5VXVlem13S1BiQ2ZvNlZnM0ttTnlScDVDeWpUNHFRTXRDb3VLaGhYZzRXeWJRRHFORVRmS2tjMnpoUlE9PQ==

I also read Gorzynski Smith and Clayden. Gorzynski Smith's book is really similar to Klein. I think I preferred her ""how to name... "" sections. Clayden was more advanced (for me at least), but certain concepts like H NMR or IR were really well explained.

"Pros to becoming a chemist:
- it's interesting and a really big field, so there's lots of directions to go in
- you're effectively understanding the building blocks of the universe. Chemistry is literally everything, it's why it's called the central science.
- even though there's lots of theory, it's a field dominated by applications. While the fundamental science is interesting and important, applications of chemistry are just as interesting. It's a great chance to do important work on interesting projects.
- there's lots of jobs
- opportunities to go to grad school to get even deeper in a sub-field and research

Cons:
- the pay often isn't great, this is probably the biggest con. Get into chemistry because of passion, not in order to make lots of money. 
- it's hard
- there's lots of low-level jobs, but it can be hard to move up with just a bachelor's degree

"Depends what you mean by ""pure chemistry"". 

Many chemicals either come from natural sources (i.e., are biosynthesized) or are used in biological applications (drugs, food, medical device polymers). Biosynthesis is an increasingly large (and valid) part of organic synthesis as well. You don't need to be an expert in biology, but refusing to learn any isn't likely to do you favors in finding jobs. 

If you don't mind gaining some background knowledge to understand where what you're doing fits into the larger context, then there are a lot of ""pure chemistry"" jobs as they relate to what you're actually doing. 

There's also a lot of open interpretation in your comment about what you consider ""biology"" vs ""chemistry"". For example, the American Chemical Society considers biochemistry one of the core 5 disciplines of chemistry, and you can't get an ACS certified degree without taking it.

Petrochemicals, electrochemistry, water chemistry (still deal with biodegradation here) and metal analysis are all areas that will have minimal to no biology.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncDdIX0tpc3VzcGFla3BIRmh0ZmREaVdQcDFDWXdGLTZEQ2doMWxGTnk0b1ZNMkNVQjdueE9xWkcwNno4ZmdNMTdMZzc4eEVCVV9INlNjMFYwY0R1enc9PQ==

Just some advice, but high school courses are an absolutely horrible metric for what you will like in college, or post-college work, most of the time. Most of them mimic very little of how the work in the field actually looks, or what studying in the field in college requires. 

That's not to say don't go with what you know you like, but I strongly encourage students to try new things in college even if they didn't like them in high school. 

I would say about half of the students who decide to major in chemistry because they liked chemistry in HS end up swapping majors: many of them because they liked the algorithmic approach that works for solving problems in general chemistry, and not the rest of the curriculum. On the other hand, I get a ton of students taking my general chemistry class who tell me they hate chemistry (and are majoring in biology or physics or something similar) taking my class for a requirement, and they end up realizing they love it.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncWVuRUNDUnc3bEpEMlN2bXVkcm9GMEpuVGlMblZDUldrdW1rckZ5ZDRHQi1TUHYyYllYZjdUcEJjakdMUVZ4WmZFeDFIbzhDN1pBZ3pNMkd6dk40REE9PQ==

"> new generic kind of chrome metallic powder 

It might be the particular metal or alloy used to make the powder is reactive over time with the gel you are using. Try a few different powders from different companies/sources. If possible, try to find out the exact composition of the powders you are using. Not many companies will say, or say something completely generic like ""Aluminum powder"", but maybe you'll get lucky and they'll say.

I know magnesium powder tends to react with moisture to become magnesium oxides. And it will also react with organic acids (which your gel might have small amounts of), and become nearly clear magnesium carboxylates. Not sure what you have though.


Sometimes its the particle size that makes the difference. Some metals like aluminum do react, but only the surface layer. If the particles are extremely small, then they completely react away. But if the particles are large enough, the aluminum core remains while the shell reacts and so you still see them, maybe with discoloration, but they were still there. So in that case, you would select a less fine powder, or a heavier grade, so more of it remains over time.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUldlckRSV1I3WVZObnpIejlNWGxaUURidFhnN0xNeURQTmhydmdqSzJ4dUtfcWxLWXhxUGRKN3JhYVZNNXVjZkdSOHdMNzJuQ2dEOGNYbUtBUGo3elRJRWlZdUdCMGZDT2Y5TDlRblU1VFk9

"I think the tetramethylammonium salts do behave this way, but this is tricky to quantify, because the fluoride salts are generally not stable as such.  (Anhydrous fluoride is highly basic and nucleophilic, and will induce SN2 or E2 with many organic cations.)

"I was an earth science guy that got his first teaching job as a high school chemistry teacher.  I had the bare minimum to teach chemistry and loved it.  I worked my but off since taking chemistry to pass the tests is a whole lot different than teaching it.  Moved to another state and taught earth science but took summer school courses to meet the new state’s chemistry requirements to teach it.  So I was a high school chemistry teacher for 20+ years without a formal degree in chemistry.  However my Masters in Science Education combined in my overall course work in chemistry allowed me to teach chemistry labs at a 4 year liberal arts college as an adjunct for 10 years.  So I really didn’t pursue chemistry initially but it found me and ended up enjoying it.  I left education when I moved to another state and could not get a teaching job so I got my first non-education job as a QC laboratory technician for an aviation and aerospace company.  I love my new position but it was my education, training, and experience as a science teacher that got me the job.

"I was a visiting scientist for several years at Kemicentrum in Lund, Sweden, in the mid 80s.   I treasure that time.   The country was clean, safe, courteous, and very very family oriented.   The salaries were a bit low,  but the affordability of medical, dental, and other forms of care made up for it.  There was essentially no language barrier.  Not only did they provide free Swedish language classes,  most everyone in the cities spoke English.   In fact it was sometimes hard for me to practice my (bad) Swedish because they would speak English while I would murder Swedish.  :)  

I bicycled all over S Sweden,  and also on Gotland and other destinations.  I always felt safe riding my bike.  The drivers were cautious and courteous.  

I was stunned by the lab safety protocols.   Things we had done blithely in the USA were totally forbidden in the USA as being unsafe.   Once again the Swedes put safety and health in front of corporate profits.

Employers refuse to take on people who they can easily train if they can just wait a while and get someone else. Completely stagnates the job market.

Only horrid industry crap that is basically like ""why would I go to college for this type of job?"" Insane hours/shifts, trash pay, often times effectively minimum wage given the cost of living, TONS of temp work, etc.

I got IT certified, but that market is trash atm as well.

Basically, unless you know someone on the inside, mobility for BS holders is like zero. I keep saying this: even post docs are getting scammed with low pay at jobs that just prop up academia for academia's sake, rather than the career progression of all the skilled, educated people that are a rapidly growing population.

My options now are basically: work at McDonald's soon because no one is hiring anywhere else, apply for a PhD program (bio) and hope I get in next year, and hope that a second degree that costs almost nothing from a public uni actually makes a difference.

"Eh. Don’t be like this guy, figure out what you want to do in life and then tailor your education to that. Dont just major in a science and assume it will make you good money. A chemistry bachelors is a stepping stone degree. The degree itself doesn’t teach you enough to have skills that companies pay for. It does, however, equip you with the knowledge you need to specialize and gain those skills in graduate school. I do not recommend a chem BS only, especially if you have big career aspirations. The majority of the pessimistic people I’ve seen on this subreddit never had a plan for after college and just assumed their degree would entitle them to a big salary without actually doing the research to determine if that was true.

"First of all, the activity series is for single displacement. This is about the ease of metals to lose electrons and not ions like Na+ and Mg²+ here.  
What you did here is double displacement, which in simplified terms works by solubility. Both the MgCO3 and CO2 got out of the solution, one as a solid and the other as a gas, which drove the reaction forward. Insoluble and/or unstable products drive double displacement forward.

Now, to the interesting part. Magnesium carbonate can be turned into other magnesium salts by reacting it with aqueous acid, releasing CO2 and water in this process. A few examples:  
MgCO3 + 2 HCl -> MgCl2 + CO2 + H2O  
MgCO3 + H2SO4 -> MgSO4 + CO2 + H2O  
MgCO3 + 2 CH3COOH -> Mg(CH3COO)2 + CO2 + H2O  
The latter (acetic acid) is found in vinegar.

"I don't know how much help my experience will be, but I got a Bachelors in Biology (with another major in Chemistry) and went to work at a VERY prestigious university where I got paid CRAP as a technician. It turns out that each type of degree has a value, and (at that time) biology was one of the lowest paid positions. But I found out that I could apply for the graduate school, and what the Hell, I *eventually* got a Masters from a ""fancy school"".  However, not before I became allergic to virtually every damn animal in the animal room. When I asked to transfer to another area of research that didn't involve endangering my life (the allergic reactions were SEVERE), I was refused.

So I left biology and went looking for a new career - most of the high paying ones required ""higher"" mathematics, so what the Hell - I went to a state school in the south for a graduate mathematics degree! As for the new graduate school mathematics benefits, the ""reduced"" graduate assistant mathematics stipend was 175% of my previous biology assistant stipend.  After a year, it was double, and equal to my pay as a biology technician, and later it exceeded that. 

Eventually, with my biology and chemistry went to work as a software engineer.  As the company was bought out and transferred around, my broad base of experience in bio and chem fended off the usual strategy of ""buy a company and fire everyone"" 3 or 4 times.  I ended up as a Senior Software Engineer for about 30 years. 

The lesson? Go and learn whatever has the highest pay. Sure, you might have to actually take business classes (biggest bunch of shitheads in suits you'll ever want to work with) but is you have a technical background and even modest mathematics skills (multivariate calculus, probability and stats) then you will be light years ahead of most of those ""future business leaders"" - just don't deliberately dismiss them *en mass*.

The answer to that is obvious. Maths is like learning to play piano, no one is born brilliant some people just have natural advantages at it.

"Same way I made some in the lab:  Take the three metal oxides in the right ratio (grind, press and bake at ... 950C IIRC for a few hours.  Grind, press and repeat, until it demonstrates superconduvity (usually detected by looking for magnetic levitation).  YBCO is a 'nearly stoichiometric' material, and just baking in air usually gets you the right level of 'just off stoichiometric' oxygen to show the effect.

That said: I don't think you're going to be successful.  You're looking to cost optimise the \\_cheap\\_ part of using YBCO (the material itself) - the expensive part is the liquid nitrogen to keep it cold enough to superconduct.  You'll need a high temperature, feedback controlled. furnace, suitable for running for hours - that's not cheap, and not cheap to run.   You'll also need pretty high pressures - and a die to form the pellets in.  A cheap arbour press would probably work, but the die is going to cost (or you already have a metalworking lathe to make it on).

Finally, superconducting \\_wires\\_ are very difficult to make with a brittle ceramic.  The usually way to make a wire that doesn't just destroy itself due to thermal shock is to ... not actually make a superconducting wire.  Instead, a high density of superconducting powder is embedded into a metal of good conductivity (silver is usual here), such that there's a superconducting pathway for nearly all of the distance to be covered.

Making a simple disc at home, if you have access to an electric furnace (or even a pottery kiln) is possible, but I think you're aiming for something that is useful, you'll need tight process control to get consistent results, and that's not cheap nor easy.",r/chemistry,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNneGxiSk1jSEdZSlVwY0k1WDB2SlFrSWN4THc1d2tvWlJpRWlES3ptMHBZWHJOTldlWDlGYlBGcHZHRUF0LVR3bEJEenFENi1oeExSWDFtaHI3ZnJuZmc9PQ==

"The amount of it in consumer products is, at least in europe, regulated very conservatively. As long as you use it as suggested and don't eat it, its application in consumer products in the amounts you are exposed to is generally considered safe.

To give you an idea of the scrutiny employed, if 1 in 100.000 people experiences health issues from a product, this is about the treshold of concern and would make regulators consider pulling the product from the shelf.
