"'I spoke to 🇨🇳 FM Wang Yi about Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and made clear that Russia's actions are a flagrant breach of the UN Charter. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council we expect China to stand up for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.'

Chinese President Xi Jinping tells Russian President Vladimir Putin that China supports resolving the Ukraine issue through negotiation. Xi says China maintains a consistent basic position on respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the United Nations charter, according to a tweet by the state-run Global Times.  
  
A report on the talks by China's CCTV says Putin explained the historical background and the status of Russia's military operation, stressing that the U.S. and NATO had ignored Russia's concerns. The report says Russia is willing to hold high-level talks with Ukraine. According to the state broadcaster, Xi said China would decide its position based on the merits of the Ukraine issue itself.",r/chinapolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSdklhRGVpazQwSVRJUm5UVlVyaWI3LUlDRWkzX0lqVU91MjdWNjd1OEg2WWVqb1JWSUVyaVZVSVE0bjdIZDhWVGVTOVNmb1kxY01EQ1VQUTYwd1VNakE9PQ==

"Yu, an influential economist in China, wrote on his blog last week: ""If China encounters the same sanctions as it did on Russia, our overseas assets risk turning into zero.""  
  
After russian troops flooded into Ukraine, the U.S. and its allies launched a series of sanctions, including removing some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system. Russia's central bank's foreign exchange reserves were also frozen, sending the ruble plunging.  
  
Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University, said a country with a large trade surplus like China has to invest in foreign assets and has few options other than U.S. bonds.  
  
""With the imposition of sanctions, Washington has demonstrated that its ability to control the global payment system gives the United States enormous power. Countries such as China, Iran, Russia and Venezuela concerned about that power now have more reason to hold foreign currencies other than the dollar. But desire is just desire. What other options do these countries have?""  
  
China has been accumulating foreign income from its exports since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.
