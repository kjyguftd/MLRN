"I threw it into ChatGPT, seems like it's all accurate üòÖ

Deregulation and Investment:

Accurate: Deregulation was indeed marketed as a means to encourage investment in needed areas. However, the effectiveness of deregulation has been debated, with varying outcomes in different regions.

Difference between Power (MW) and Energy (MWh):

Accurate: Power (measured in megawatts, MW) and energy (measured in megawatt-hours, MWh) are different concepts. Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed, while energy is the total amount of power used over time. This distinction is crucial in energy management and trading.

Frequency and Droop:

Accurate: Frequency is a measure of the stability of the power grid and is typically maintained around 60 Hz in the US. Droop refers to the change in generator output frequency in response to changes in load, and it is indeed challenging to monetize directly.

Sales Pitch and Maintenance Costs:

Accurate: The argument for selling off generation assets often included high maintenance costs for old generators, with the expectation that private investment would lead to more efficient operations. However, this has not always resulted in the anticipated improvements.

Education on Power Generation:

Accurate: Business and law schools often do not cover the technical complexities of three-phase power generation and distribution. This can lead to gaps in understanding when it comes to managing or regulating the power sector.

Step-up Transformer Wait Times:

Accurate: There are significant lead times for critical components like step-up transformers, which can indeed take 18-24 months to replace, impacting grid reliability.

Breaker Settings:

Accurate: Breaker settings can vary between the generation site and the transmission/distribution grid. The specific trip settings (e.g., 59.6 Hz or 59.8 Hz) are critical for maintaining grid stability and preventing widespread outages.

Regional Comparisons:

Accurate: Comparing fully regulated states with deregulated ones can provide insights into the effectiveness of different regulatory models. Texas, for instance, has faced significant challenges, including the well-publicized power outages in 2021, highlighting some of the limitations of its market-based approach.",r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUTVhbnFzblMwRHJZOGVtSXBlY2xSYTNRdDFmMVZLcW1vZ3pnUHM4cXlxNXlXNElRRXdoQjVxNk40a1NfcXBaSWRSUWpPLUYzd2NsMHJhMlhmWVZJa1E9PQ==

"The damage has already been done and there is only one logical move at this point:

Biden absolutely must step down.

If Biden were to stay in, Trump would have tons of ammo listing all the Democratic politicians, celebrities, voters, and donors that don‚Äôt think Biden is fit to serve.

No campaign has ever ran the oldest candidate in history with very evident signs of cognitive decline being the daily topic of the national media for weeks on end.

No campaign has ever has dozens of their own politicians call for the candidate to step down or had this level of well known superstar supporters of the party call for their own candidate to step down or had their donors say they will withhold funding until the current candidate steps down or had the majority of the voters of their own party want the candidate to step down.

Trump could stay things like ‚Äúthey all wanted him to drop out folks, they don‚Äôt think he can do the job‚Äù in the days right before the election.

Ousting Biden for someone that can passionately and clearly deliver a compelling message would be a huge win for the Democrats.

A Democrat candidate that can passionately and clearly deliver a compelling message and does not raise any questions about their health can take his place.

The Democrats can say that they did what they needed to do to pressure out an unfit candidate in cognitive decline and this is where the counterpunch hits full force:

Trump would be about the exact same age Biden was when he became President and is showing his own moments of cognitive decline, which could be put under a microscope.

The same danger of a President being overcome with cognitive decline and refusing to step down is even greater with Trump (Trump tried to rig an election, tried to stage a coup, and the Supreme Court just gave him dictator level powers if he were to be President again).

The standards for each party have hit the dirt and are sinking into the ground at this point. Whichever side actually decides to raise their standards has the best chances in this election.

[As Jon Stewart pointed out, there‚Äôs still plenty of time for the Democratic Party to have multiple candidates present their vision and choose the strongest one.](https://youtu.be/S9LZXheHddI)

Any attempts by the Republicans to try to obstruct the democratic process or prevent funds going to the new Democratic candidate would only further expose them for what they are and bolster support & donations for the new Democratic candidate.

My vote is for the Democratic Party to raise the bar.

"The [COVID lockdowns of 2020 temporarily lowered our rate of CO2 emissions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18922-7/figures/1).  Humanity was still a net CO2 gas emitter during that time, so we made things worse, but did so more a bit more slowly.  That's why a [graph of CO2 concentrations](https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/) shows a continued rise.

[Stabilizing the climate means getting human greenhouse gas emissions to approximately zero](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached).  We didn't come anywhere near that during the lockdowns.

I know that the President is elected by the Electoral College which is made up of electors from each state.

I know that if Biden got 10,457 votes fewer in Arizona, 11,779 votes fewer votes in Georgia and 20,682 fewer votes in Wisconsin then Trump would have won.

"But I would like to sound one note of warning. Penicillin is to all intents and purposes non-poisonous so there is no need to worry about giving an overdose and poisoning the patient. There may be a danger, though, in underdosage. It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body. The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily underdose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant.

"Absolutely 100%, GOP will destroy the little progress that has been made in US green energy.  Infrastructure and IRA bills do more than just green energy, they slow the extreme infrastructure decline in US.

Yet, drill baby drill is not actually pro US oil profits.  Ukraine war is massive profit boom.  Massive tariffs on EVs, solar and batteries, is massive oil profit protection.  The general US/global oil sector always antagonizing democrats with high prices, and supporting Republicans with higher production, actually makes democrats the best for oil profit dominance.

More drilling permits, is not actually needed for US oil which already has significant unused permits.  Where GOP can seriously accelerate global destruction, instead of democrats just slowing it down a bit, is through additional oil and fossil electricity development subsidies.  Texas is paying for new natural gas plants.

Basically, USA has a core global destruction agenda, specifically to perpetuate oil relevance.  Without oil, there is less to fight about.

One ship forever gone, is that the US cannot dominate energy any more because it has been so busy protecting oil and gas.  Europe and China NG use is down.  Gasoline down.  Only Russia/Ukraine war diesel use keeps prices high.  The only path to GOP ""energy dominance"" is coercion of allies and China into US dependence, and middle east wars against current allies to suppress supplies.  More terrorism against Russian refineries.

Oil oligarchy masters of GOP and US rule, actually are satisfied with current policies, because they don't rock the boat too fast, and are awesome for short term profits.

"I personally haven't noticed a decline in butterflies this year fortunately, and it's something that my family and I take note of every year. Allow me to explain, if you will:

A little over 20 years ago, we planted 2 ""Butterfly Bushes"" in the middle of our yard to both attract and help pollinators, whether they be butterflies, bees, or even hummingbirds. I don't know the scientific name of the things we planted, my dad did know and was very proud of them but he passed away in 2018. These butterfly bushes have many little white flowers per branch at the end of each branch. They have a nice fragrant smell and don't require much upkeep at all. I'm just outside of Philly, but about 75 yards from where I live, is the edge of a large forested area that we colloquially call ""the Woods."" There are plenty of flora and fauna in these woods, such as deer, we've occasionally had turkeys show up in our front yard, and there's a stream in the middle of the woods that even once had a beaver in it (damn! Sorry I couldn't resist the dad joke). So far this year I've seen both Yellow (most common) Monarchs, Orange Monarchs, and more small white butterflies than I can count! 

If one really wants to both see more butterflies and help them at the same time, I highly recommend trying to ""lure"" them in. Do a quick Google search of ""Butterfly Bush"" and you should see what I'm talking about. The hardiest version has white flowers, but there is a version with purple flowers that is gorgeous but they are more difficult to keep going on a year to year basis. The purple flower ones don't like how cold it gets around here, that's my hypothesis at least.",r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcXNKbUV6TndBZ3hUUFkxRUtIWEE3QzhBZG1FaTZTRnpQejBhenMyQU5rcUdIaWc1MlNQZHF6N2F1WUlTaGJYeEdMNUNfeUpsdGhLbkhYbHNzQV9iRWc9PQ==

'To meet the major growth in demand, driven in large part by Bitcoin mining, Texas is turning to ^natural gas power plants^, with taxpayers providing the down payment. In 2023, the Texas Legislature passed a loan program, later approved by voters as ballot Proposition 7, to give low-interest loans to companies to build or expand power plants. At first, the Texas Energy Fund will have $10 billion to award, after receiving more than $39 billion in requests.' Thats 39 billion that could be going to renewable energy instead.

It‚Äôs interesting to me that the original designers of helicopters specifically chose a design that required air temperatures of 120 degrees or less for their designs to work (I guess, how would they have known. But again not much margin for error). And who knew that the air at ground level at 120 degrees would be about the same as normal temperature air at 25,000 feet which seems to be the limit of turbo engine helicopters.‚Äù",r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSkp3RGo2Q3JlYS1uSEdvLW5xTGhPMTBoLU1qLTRsbzFINjhldFlXeGJ5RGxzREdLVGd4STVyR0hmSUI2cWZvenphY1Z2TUJSQ2Z4QVFjR3FuV0VSZmc9PQ==
">Really sick of the lazy belief that industry contributing more pollution means you are totally off the hook as an individual. Your emissions and impacts still count - especially if you live in the global north! We can address systematic and individual aspects at once!

While I do mostly agree with your statement here, I'm also additionally equally sick of the flip side of that coin, too.  Too many folks wanna just lay all the blame in the lap of ""the consumer"" for even buying the products in the first place (as if we've been given much choice what's available on store shelves, or what advertising propaganda we're brainwashed on from birth forward).

It's also frustrating how much emphasis is placed on how **we** must all sacrifice to fix the problem, and nearly nothing said about how much of their obscene ""profits"" those who contributed **most** to the problem should be required to invest in the cleanup / recovery efforts.  Those who **profited** most from the destruction should **absolutely** pay the most toward the cleanup of the resulting mess from their actions.

To really have much any hope for a ""non-Mad Max"" wasteland future, we kinda need **most** of humanity on-board with some cooperation and efforts toward **real, lasting, positive** change in how we interact with each other and our environment.

"I did read the article, but there is more to a rotorcraft performance than just its lift. Rotorcraft are very much dependent on their power source to provide power to turn the main rotors as well as to turn the anti-torque tail rotor. The hotter temps reduce the ability of the turbine engine to produce power. Which in turn limits its ability to produce additional lift that is already being robbed by the hot temps. The benefits of the EVTOL is that all the power is being provided to lifting the aircraft vertically. You‚Äôre not losing any power to an anti-torque system and with multiple rotor disks, you‚Äôve effectively increased the lifting surface area. That‚Äôs why when you look at any heavy lift system, it will have either more blades to lift such as the CH-53s or the CH-47s that take all the power and just convert it to lift. 

With the right configuration helicopters can have very high service ceilings. I don‚Äôt know what your idea of low ceiling is, but the H125 has a service ceiling of 29,000‚Äô.

"> In 2024, version 9 of its Levelised Cost of Storage Comparison, Lazard finds better value for money in the longer duration energy storage system (ESS) applictions, with a stand-alone 100MW four-hour battery the cheapest at between $US170-$296/MWh, not including available US subsidies.

LCoS only applies when you are drawing power from the storage. 

The whole point is that with the expected mix of stored power and power delivered directly to the grid from cheap renewables, renewables plus storage are significantly cheaper.

> Power system decarbonization modeling, regardless of level of renewables deployment, suggests that the U.S. will need ~550‚Äì770 GW of additional clean, firm capacity to reach net-zero; nuclear power is one of the few proven options that could deliver this at scale

I think you should be very sceptical of government sources on energy policy statements like that. Sure, if it's peer reviewed science, that's one thing, but this isnt that. They are making very broad statements there and the last part is an assertion that is quite obviously more out of date every day. 

And if you look at how hard, expensive and time consuming it has been to deliver the most recent new nuclear power plants in the US, can you even imagine how time consuming and expensive it will be to build about 450 new reactors in the next 25 years? The US has less than 100GW of nuclear right now. It would take 10 years just to find and train the engineers you would need and set up the extremely complex supply chains. It would then take decades to build them. Decades we don't have.

And that's before you get onto costs, where nuclear is already far more expensive, and that gap only grows every month and year that passes.

Look at China. It had a plan for huge deployment of nuclear but as it has driven down the cost of renewables and storage, and as it has hit delay after delay with its nuclear build out, it has steadily rolled back its nuclear roll-out plan because it has found it to be too expensive, too slow and too complex to actually deliver. Meanwhile it is rolling out renewables with storage at record-shattering rates year after year. A recent new project includes 8GW solar, 4GW wind and 5GWh of storage

https://www.pv-tech.org/china-three-gorges-renewables-to-build-8gw-solar-pv-project-in-inner-mongolia/

and they will deliver it in 3 YEARS! You'd be lucky to have even broken ground 3 years into the typical nuclear plant build these days!

Like I said, nuclear is a dead end. While nuclear gets slower and more expensive, the alternatives get faster, bigger and cheaper. The longer the US and other western nations insist on blowing tens of billions in private and public money on this technology, the faster they will fall behind China on energy in the coming decades.

EDIT: note in your link how they model starting new nuclear to be coming online in the early 2030s. This is pure fantasy. Recent projects have taken 15 years or longer to get finished. And the rapid ramp up to 13GW/year is also insanely optimistic. That is 13 reactors being completed every year. And they think this rate will be achieved by 2040. This is again, fantasy.  You would have to back in time 15 years and start then to get close to these numbers. It's really a joke. The people who put that graph on paper should be embarrassed.",r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY3V6ZEVqaXVfYm9iaGhmVGMyUW9VS3FESDA1bU5HTlM5b2lpVzlEWndVbTZlVkRYd2xjMXdpdTFWVUFVanlSSFZXTERNZkNSaDR2eVE2YlRVWGF3blE9PQ==

"Actually the warming up of the oceans at this rate doesn't point to many made global warming. On the contrary, it points to a different source of heating such as higher levels of low frequency radiation that the earth is receiving which would coincide with what we have seen from the sun in the last few years. If you don't understand what I'm saying try this experiment . Put water in a large pot with water temperature equal to ocean temperature out a lid on it then heat just the air to current global air temps. You will find that the water will take forever to change temperature. It's if fact hardly noticable. Now bombard that pot of water with a few microwaves and notice the rapid temperature changes. Heat from above does little to water temperature radiation does a lot. If this is the case the our current climate change analysis is wrong and we might be wise to reconsider what we think.

"Lol, get out of here with this BS. Nuclear ***fission***, hydro, solar, and wind are all we need. Solving our reliance on fossil fuels is not a technological problem. It is a political problem. We could have eliminated fossil fuels at least 20 years ago and could have done it at least 40 years ago had we been forward thinking enough.

The only thing keeping us reliant on fossil fuels is the lack of political will to crack down on fossil fuels and make the change. Start voting for people who take a hard stance against fossil fuels and are willing to push legislation that will make the changes needed. It is the lack of confidence in maintaining voters that really prevent a lot of necessary changes from happening. So the more that get our and start voting for those willing to take a stance against fossil fuels, the more politicians will be willing to do what is necessary.

Unfortunately, no politician is going to ruin their career pushing for something that has a risk of alienating voters.

"From Bloomberg reporters Eamon Farhat, Misha Savic, Fiona MacDonald, and Mark Chediak:

Hotter summers mean spikes in demand for cooling, as high temperatures cause wires to sag and risk sparking forest fires. Upgrades to power infrastructure haven‚Äôt kept pace, even as efforts to reduce use of fossil fuels make electricity distribution more crucial.

Triggered by a surge in consumption and unstable supply links, the blackout in Montenegro in late June knocked out grids at neighboring countries and wreaked havoc on households, hospitals and beach bars. The incident in the Balkans has been repeated around the world.

The climate crisis exposes electricity networks to flash floods ripping down transmission towers, droughts drying up hydro reservoirs and demand spikes from cooling during searing heat.

"Food in general.

When agriculture starts failing, the writing is on the wall.

The problem with moving away from fossil fuels, after profits, is reserves.

If you decided that Exxon's reserves were in fact worthless, they would be insolvent overnight. Their reserves underpin their borrowing.

But even just on raw operating profits, renewables look horrible to the energy industry.

Low prices, low margins for renewables. Compared to high prices and high margins now.

"I disagree, in the sense that developing countries still need to develop, and they should, and degrowth backs that up as well.  Their emissions per capita are typically lower than the Western Nations and historically WE are responsible for the output, not them.  There is a world that both can happen.  I am not about disadvantaging poor/developing countries, and the truth is we are disadvantaging them already in many cases by preventing them from growing.  

Degrowth is NOT immoral at all if you read about it and learn about its aim and details, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúlets create a recession and hurt everyone‚Äù as capitalists like to spin it.   Thinking that it would disadvantage poor countries shows a misunderstanding of its concepts.  In fact it is deeply about equality and justice so it‚Äôs in fact MORE moral, just not in a preferred way for those in power.

Also GDP is a pointless antiquated  metric and has been decoupled from human well being for decades.  Costs Rica has 1/80 the GDP of the US and about 1/6 the GDP per capita yet people are healthier, happier and have a life expectancy of 8 years longer, for example, so you get my point.  Even the inventor of GDP strongly asserted that it should only be used in conjunction with other metrics and not by itself, and he was summarily ignored.  GDP is about baseless economic growth in a world of finite resources where constant growth is impossible, we are seeing several examples of these limits being hit already.

Technology may be a helpful tool but again, it‚Äôs arrogant and hubristic to have an over reliance on fixing the problem with the same thing that created it.  Most all Geo-Engineering solutions have either been debunked, or are prohibitively expensive compared to just reducing our usage and changing our patterns.

Yes, it‚Äôs very much on the table. Several factors could cause a die-off of phytoplankton:

1. **Rising Ocean Temperatures**: Warmer waters can reduce the mixing of ocean layers, limiting the nutrients available to phytoplankton.

2. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased CO2 levels lead to more acidic oceans, which can harm phytoplankton and disrupt their growth.

3. **Pollution**: Runoff containing fertilizers and other pollutants can create dead zones where oxygen levels are too low for phytoplankton to survive.

4. **Viral Infections**: Certain viruses can infect and kill phytoplankton, leading to significant die-offs.

The health of phytoplankton populations is crucial for maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems and the overall health of our planet.

If phytoplankton started to die off in the oceans, the consequences would be severe and far-reaching:

1. **Disruption of the Marine Food Chain**: Phytoplankton form the base of the marine food web. Their decline would affect all marine life, from tiny zooplankton to large fish, marine mammals, and seabirds.

2. **Reduction in Oxygen Production**: Phytoplankton contribute to about 50-80% of the world‚Äôs oxygen production. Their decline would significantly reduce the amount of oxygen produced, impacting both marine and terrestrial life.

3. **Increased Carbon Dioxide Levels**: Phytoplankton play a crucial role in sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Their die-off would reduce the ocean‚Äôs capacity to absorb CO2, exacerbating climate change.

4. **Economic Impact**: Many human industries, such as fisheries, rely on healthy marine ecosystems. A decline in phytoplankton would disrupt these industries, leading to economic losses and food shortages.",r/climate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVllpYlVCdHJ1RmlmVWdkLW16NDNERkNEeml4bV9MNVR6NDVkdk1pV01ydTEtMmNuX1NvSDFwbEdMTERqX1RkUTF5NmF3ZDJZZm5zcTdrU2Rwc0FIR0E9PQ==

"For sure those are reasonable points.  And Trump plays an equal amount of political games with climate change - I think the difference is the direct attack and signaling out of Tesla by Biden.  Thus making it personal for Musk.   And clearly Musk has been a much larger critic of Bidens general other policies (border security, DEI etc).

I suppose you could also say that Bidens overall degenerating mental and physical state in recent years could easily have been the thing that pushed Musk to Trump recently.

"It doesn't have to reward the righteous and good.

It only has to properly allow for the interests of everyone to be taken into account when making a decision.

For example, a car plant that is owned by capitalists is very likely to move manufacturing to another country with lower costs for labor and weaker environmental protections because that makes them more profit.

A car plant run by its workers is unlikely to do that.


A factory run for capitalists with the sole demand to make profits is quite likely to make weapons that kill kids in foreign countries. A factory run by workers with secure jobs and families of their own is less likely to do this. I use this example because it's a real world example of how democratic worker decision making works in practice.
