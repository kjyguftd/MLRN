"You haven't had very good answers to this, so i will try and give you a better explanation. 

The surveillance itself isn't the unjust part, it is what can be done with it in the wrong hands. 

You might argue - but its not in the wrong hands. However, its overwhelmingly likely that one day it will be.

China is accused of unfair treatment of Muslims, specifically Uyghurs. Lets imagine some part of the Chinese government wants to imprison or restrict Uyghurs. With mass surveillance this can be done in minutes. Uyghurs, like jews, will have facial characteristics, so you have your facial recognition select for these characteristics, and then refuse admission to transport to anyone matching. This would get it wrong many times, but the people implementing would not care. If you look like a Uyghur to a bigot, that's enough. 

My family parted from Judaism many generations ago, but the Nazis would have killed us anyway.

Sometimes the ethics of a situation is not about the reality of the situation in the present, but the possible perversions of that situation as time goes by. This is the case for surveillance. If your 'masters' are good, then surveillance is fine. But they will not stay good forever, so surveillance is incredibly dangerous.",r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHQmhxaU9FNXRYVkx1aTBaYVIxZl9jR1pxSXBsQ0hjM1RncWF2SUJRNGdfQTVRNXR1R3J6UWVKTnRITUxxVTU2WFV1NWhTaWRPcWlpRHNpTWhMdkhWTmc9PQ==

"In the first 70 years of nuclear power plant operation,  we had Chernobyl, and Fukushima as major accidents, resulting in massive amount of irradiated land.

We also had the [Kyshtym disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyshtym_disaster), the [Windscale fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire), [Three Mile Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_accident), and around 2 dozen smaller nuclear incidents.

What you are proposing is effectively a 10x increase in that,  or a Fukushima every 3-4 years or so, and multiple minor incidents a year.  All to produce power that is still more expensive than wind power.

No thanks.  If anything, the reactors need to be more safe.  Not less.  And to be competitive, it needs to be a lot cheaper. 

Seeing as nuclear power plants are one of the few [examples of negative learning](https://www.rethinkx.com/blog/the-pattern-of-disruption-france-the-most-powerful-force-in-the-universe).   The more reactors you build, the more expensive they get, which is a trend observed by all countries around the world with a significant fleet of them.

>The cost of nuclear power is also driven by feedback loops, but that study by the IIASA, using data made public in the year 2000, found that France’s nuclear program perversely exhibited negative learning-that is, the more nuclear capacity that was built throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the *more expensive* building additional reactors became.

>The IIASA study attributes this trend to other feedback loops–regulatory ones. As each new nuclear project was undertaken, regulators required more safety features, more locally made equipment and components, and new generations of reactors that effectively reset the learning curve to a new, higher starting point.

>And this was true not just for France. The study found that 'all countries with significant programs invariably exhibit negative learning' in nuclear power costs.

  
Meanwhile,  renewables and battery technology are continuing their inexorable drop to cheaper and cheaper price points,  and leaving nuclear power behind.

"If you don’t live in “cancer alley” then, honestly, sit back down.

I’ll also add that wind and solar are not, and never will be, one-shot solutions to climate change. They can’t be placed anywhere - they require way more plastics and composites, and are still reliant on petrochemicals - and the only reason they can even possibly be cheaper, is because the burden of regulation on nuclear power is multiple orders of magnitude greater than any other form of power on earth, despite being both safer and more efficient.

The only accident in your examples which apply to US power is Three Mile Island - which had ZERO fatalities. Also, that UK disaster was at a weapons plant, NOT a power plant.

"I really hope your understanding of SpaceX design philosophy isn’t this shallow. But in case it is…

1. SpaceX uses “hardware rich” development because it is the fastest way to get information and key learning that is impossible to get from simulations alone.
2. Explosions come with the territory in rocket development. Would you rather have failures in development like SpaceX or in production like the Space Shuttle?
3. The entire point is “learn as fast as possible” with the obvious framework of doing so safely. 

Also find it hilarious that people decided to downvote the truth because they don’t actually have any counter argument. When France was building 50 reactors in 3 decades, their average build time was ~6 years. South Korea is STILL building in 7-7.5 years. Just because the US and UK are proving massively incompetent at infrastructure projects (what else is new?), doesn’t mean it’s not incredible mental laziness to blame nuclear for those countries’ faults.

China built how many thousands of miles of high-speed rail in 10 years? How many major failures have those systems had?

SpaceX debris is making it back to Earth even though the best engineers thought it should burn up. Its pure luck that massive chunks of spaceship haven't caused damage.

Chinese buildings go up fast but build quality is unreliable and regulations are ignored. It doesn't matter how many builds you get right when one failure can cause massive untold death and suffering. Chinese reactors, just like SpaceX, just like the titan sub, just like boeing, and just like every other company who thinks safety concerns are overblown are not safe. Boeing and that stupid sub already had thier moments. With how quickly everyone is rushing to space, its only a matter of time if safety is ignored.

"Renewables still have issues. It seems to me that banking our energy grid on just a different kind of completely nonrenewable resource (lithium, or whatever other battery tech gets invented) is a bad idea, but without batteries, renewables have no backup.

Nuclear’s expensive, sure, but there’s nothing inherent which *makes* it expensive, is my point. If we flash back 20 years your same argument would be used against wind and especially solar, and in favor of LNG, so here we are.

Finally, your argument regarding cost is contradictory. You say that, magically, it bucks the trend and increases in cost as adoption increases. So, clearly, this trend will continue! But, literally right after, you (and your source) reveals the reason to be lobbying for more regulations, more burdensome manufacturing requirements, more NIMBYism. It follows that a governmental policy of deregulation and streamlining to allow new plants to come online quickly and efficiently would reverse this trend, and allow nuclear power to follow the same cost reduction curve of all other technology.

So much for your scaling argument.


Nuclear energy is incredibly complicated, and incredibly challenging to do safely.  That's why we spend so much money on safety and still screw it up and have meltdowns regularly.


Lithium is far more renewable than uranium.  It's 100% recyclable. There's also a ton of lithium out there, and relatively little is it is used to make a battery.  A 1000 lbs battery pack only contains about 50 lbs of lithium.


Uranium, once it's through a reactor, it's done forever.


Plus we can always use renewables to make and store hydrogen.  Batteries aren't the only way to do energy storage.  Make ammonia during the summer, store it in giant tanks, and use it as fuel in the winter.  You can afford to overbuild renewables, because your don't need to do it in 10 billion dollar plants that are only profitable if they run flat out 24/7.",r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPWG5qVUkxNWpxYkUyR1Jpa1c5QWx5alRwd0I5aFdUTkI1blFsc0tOTXZPUkRfOW1IWGVCQ3hPNkU0ZWRJYWJGd1dmV1hySWJxaGgxVjhjd29kbVh0a1E9PQ==
"Large scale solar and wind will not be built soon enough either.

You’re not wrong that a nuclear reactor takes 7-10 years to build. And solar and wind farms take on average 18 months from start of construction.

But you’re missing a couple things:

1. Money isn’t the botttleneck. We have backlogs on grid connections, raw material sources, panel and turbine manafacturing and more that are limiting the rate we can build new renewables.

2, We need a fuck-ton more energy. We been shattering records year over year in renewables growth but it’s not enough and it’s not even close. 

The world burned 140,000 TWh worth of fossil fuel last year. To put that in perspective you could cover the entire United States ocean to ocean including Alaska in solar panels and still not generate that much energy.

Fortunately we don’t need to generate that much electricity, electric motors and heat pumps are more energy efficient than their fossil fuel burning counterparts, but it’s important to have some perspective on just how much energy the world is consuming and 80+% still comes from fossil fuels.

We’ll continue ramping up our ability to build new renewables, and hopefully keep shattering growth records. But it’s not going to get off of fossil fuels soon. Hell we haven’t even gotten to the point yet where we can build new renewable capacity faster than energy demand is increasing. We’re still setting new records for fossil fuel consumption. Even with crazy optimistic assumptions, it will take at least 2-3 decades before we can get off fossil fuels with renewables.

So yes, we need to also be building new nuclear power stations.  Hundreds of them.  We can’t get there fast enough on renewables alone.",r/climateactionplan,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPZklwemFBWFFBWnh5LTczQnVHUGJublROTGh1Z0ZrLURGN3FCMzhnbmo5VkozYnE4aG1GTHhEYjk0U2c1c3pucmU5UDFhWkZ1VUFWaUt4eEZiODF6ZFE9PQ==

"1. I’m not saying renewables don’t scale, but at some point, you run out of area that you can pave over with solar panels. Nuclear scales in the sense that, there’s only so much solar energy per square ft you can find, and so much wind speed as well in an area. So, if we continue to consume more power, and in more concentrated areas, Nuclear *does* scale better.

2. Regularly? REGULARLY? What the hell? The last meltdown - 13 years ago - happened because the goddamn plant was hit by a TSUNAMI. That is in bad faith, and in poor form.

3. Breeder reactors can indefinitely produce fissile materials. So, no.

4. Name one grid-level hydrogen storage plant in existence, which does not serve some middle-of-nowhere arctic village.

"You can power the entire world with solar, by covering a tiny fraction of the surface. 


So no, you will not run out of space.


Yes, we have a meltdown every decade or so.  If we scale that up, this will be more frequent.  That's regularly.


Fukushima was built in an area known to have tsunamis, and was designed to withstand them.  It's failure isn't unique or special.  It's no different than building a reactor in a hurricane or tornado region.  It's not arguing in bad faith.  It's a recent, pertinent example. 


Here's a list of grid scale ammonia production. 


https://ammoniaenergy.org/articles/technology-status-ammonia-production-from-electrolysis-based-hydrogen/


We can, and have scaled this up.  A 30 MW electrolyzer run all 3/4 of the year, can provide 100 MW to top up those weeks in the winter where the wind doesn't blow, and the sun doesn't shine.


Breeder reactors are a good point.  But you missed my point.  Which is that you can't talk about lithium not being renewable, when it's not consumed.  Concrete is also not renewable, but it's not a problem, as it's not consumed when running the reactor.

"You miss the problem of solar, which is that while we certainly could blanket a bit of the Sahara and generate tons of energy, the problem is and always has been transport. Energy plants need to be close to their users, and plenty of user live in shady climates. Where is the unending fields of natural space in the metropolitan north east, or the greater London area, or in Tokyo, that solar needs? Space is still a problem, or if not space, transportation.

Have you actually read what happened with Fukushima? The whole problem was that a key part of plant infrastructure - emergency energy storage - was, in fact, *not* tsunami-proof. It was a design flaw, exacerbated by the fact that, again, it needed to survive tsunamis. I would likewise say that most plants should *not* be built in tornado or hurricane alleys, which is the vast majority of the planet, for that problem. I say it’s bad faith because the vast majority of nuclear plants are not built in natural disaster magnet areas, and so are not remotely in the same risk class as Fukushima.

Ammonia storage is interesting, I’ve never heard of that one and apparently it’s already deployed at scale. Very cool.

While lithium can be *recycled* and reclaimed from batteries, that’s not really different from fissiles. My point is that one battery facility requires a tremendous amount of lithium, whereas a nuclear plant requires a relatively small amount of fissile material. In fact, is breeder reactors are used, you eliminate the need for rare earth mining altogether.

Finally, this bill solves the problem I was initially talking about, namely, that approval is incredibly slow and costly and bureaucratic. The example given in the article - Plant Vogtle - is a good example. If two reactors went through all of the review and safety designs, why can’t a dozen more identical copies be built off of those same approvals?

"But that is not what the union of concerned scientists says when they mention that a third of existing nuclear plants are not profitable and/or scheduled to close.

The ucs said it would take almost a billion a year to keep existing plants from closing. I assume this legislation will allow them to operate longer on a less-safe margin, maybe not even build new plants. At some point we are propping up an industry with taxes, which is fine if it saves the planet. But we can't pretend it is the only possibility, so we have to see some cost comparisons and make an informed decision.

If nuclear can get down to be comparable to solar at $3 a watt, still more expensive than gas and wind but less emissions, then you couldn't say it is not a good investment. If it stays close to recent Georgia prices then maybe not. The 1100mw vogtle 3 and 4 project both using the Westinghouse AP1000 design (Westinghouse went bankrupt in 2017 supposedly due to cost overruns at these reactors). If we got 2 reactors for 34 billions, we are getting 1100mw for 17b each, so at current cost that is $15 a watt. Comparing solar at $3 a watt to $15 a watt I'm sure you think it is reasonable to want to see some cost numbers before springing to spend tax money on it right? 

This vox article actually has some numbers to discuss.

It does seem like other countries have got nuclear down to that $3 a watt... so it is technically possible. It just seems like a stretch between 15 and 3 full of risks you know?

">we're going to need to replace them with another source of power that's stable and can *regulate grid frequency*. Nuclear energy is perfect for this.

Batteries are perfect for this. They are cheaper than nuclear reactors, respond in milliseconds, can be placed anywhere on the grid, have low standby losses, and also provide voltage support and peak shaving.

You'll noticed I referenced both nuclear *and* coal. Renewables - which only hit the grid in meaningful numbers about a decade ago - will overtake coal next year. Nuclear energy - and its 70 years of innovations - never got close to doing that.

>At present RE is only just offsetting the amount of new energy demand in absolute terms.

Not true.
