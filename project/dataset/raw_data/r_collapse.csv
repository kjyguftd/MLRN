"> lso: Hitler was literally funded by the same sociopathic people we have at the top now.

Ironically the biggest financial backers of the nazi party (early on) were American robber barons, the same people who sat behind the Business Plot that had tried (and failed) to regime change the United States during the early part of FDR's presidency.

As explained in **George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography**, it took monumental expense and planing to cloth & equip an entire army of non-governmental soldiers (the brownshirts). The public has largely glossed over the important questions of ""how did the Nazis get the funding and materials to pull that off? they didn't have the reigns of the government yet and therefor lacked the public funding to do it.""

**The answer is they got that from American businessmen**. A US Senate investigation would later reveal that in the wake of WW1, the Hamburg-Amerika oceanliner company had been confiscated by the government and sold in a smokey back-room deal to Averell Harriman (former governor of NY and business partner of Prescott Bush). The Hamburg-Amerika was infamous during the war and late prewar years for running an espionage smuggling operation to bring nazi spies to & from the United States... but more importantly, it was used to bring US-made Remington firearms into Germany to arm the brownshirts.

Those Remingtons were made, in the United States, by Remington while it was owned by Herbert Walker & Prescott Bush.

Contrary to the modern myths US conervsatives meme about on facebook & the like, the Nazis were not the reason for gun control in Germany. On the contrary, German attempts to curb gun ownership started long before the Nazis came to power, in response to a very widespread problem of German conservatives trying to assassinate leftists & moderates (a problem that goes all the way back to the last years of WW1). Gun control was not created to disarm jews & other would-be concentration camp victims, but an attempt to disarm fascist radicals to limit how much damage they could do in society.

The Senate would later detail the exact route the guns would take once they crossed the Atlantic... with fascist smugglers using a specific path of ports, rivers, and canals to avoid taking them directly into major urban German ports where they would have been discovered and confiscated.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTS1UbDE0TlFWWGFhSUtoNk5KT0ZKZm9FS2JZREh5blpkV1J1VVRITFNOQ2lXSEZhMjAyQkxlS2d0V0xDMmNKU0tnWWcwUkxEeW5KSXNZTzVySi1IT3c9PQ==

"Truth is, one way or another, there are always a select few who controls the majority of the society and controls and owns the wealth, the laws, etc.  
This was also the case in the socialism - the communist party elite lived a much higher life then the rest. Believe me, I saw it, I experienced it. The elite lived in luxury houses on the hills of the capital city, while the majority lived in shitty concrete flat jungles, often having one common bathroom for 3-4 apartments, the elite had the best cars eastern bloc could provide while the majority had to wait for 3-4-5 years to even get a Trabant, the shittest car in the bloc, the elite had parties with the finest vodka, and luxury cognac smuggled from the west, and the best prostitutes, every weekend, in luxury weekend houses, and luxury hunting lodges, while the majority had to drink cheap, home-brewn spirit and wine, and prostitution was banned ""officially"" because it was a ""decadent western imperialist thing"".

"In my opinion collapse is already happening in many countries.

In the short-term, society will experience a painful and slow collapse with taxes going up, public spending decreasing, people working harder for less and decreasing quality of life for most people. These trends will only continue as the growing burden of the ageing population (higher percentage of older people) and fertility crisis (less people being born) increases.​

Climate change will also continue to make matters worse with rising sea levels making more land uninhabitable and more frequent natural disasters making our food supplies less reliable.

In the long-term, society could face a complete and catastrophic collapse. The only reason we can sustain such a large population is due to the creation and use of artificial fertilisers. Fossil fuels or very high energy intensive processes are needed to create artificial fertilisers at scale. When our supplies of fossil fuels start to run out, so does the high yield crops the world has become accustomed to. The countries which rely very heavily on imports of food will face having their supplies cut when there is no longer a feasible way to deliver food over long distances at scale.

​The threat of world war is already high but will be even more likely as humanity starts to run out of food, water and other essential resources. The ageing population will mean that nations are less likely to be able to take part in traditional warfare as they will not be able to spare any young people as troops. They are more likely to turn to weapons of mass destruction to get their way in desperate times.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeTIxVEhvZ3otTWJ2UFN3bWh1ajN3UVh2VE1RY05TN1ltQmR3RUhIV2Z5R3BRc2Izb2tMWG8yakJMWVNHWVcxOEF6Q05DV0J2N2hmRzNiZ3g5UVNCWGc9PQ==

> The total waste heat produced by electricity generation and combustion engines is a tiny fraction of the total solar energy hitting Earth. Here's a breakdown:
 * Solar energy reaching Earth: An enormous amount of energy constantly bathes our planet. Estimates suggest the sun delivers 173,000 terawatts to Earth.
 * Waste heat production: Our energy consumption is far less impressive. Global energy use is around 18 terawatts, and a significant portion of this is wasted as heat during conversion and use.
 * Percentage of waste heat to solar energy: Even considering the inefficiency of our processes, the waste heat produced is a minuscule fraction of the total solar energy.

"Allow me to preface, I have never and will never vote for Trump. The news of the assassination attempt spooked me. In my opinion, based off evidence around his conviction or the amount of things he’s been accused of, the money they spent in P.I.’s to dig up anything they could on him, FBI being told to arm with lethal rounds for the Mara Lago raid… The democrats really don’t want the people to have the option to vote for this guy. I joked recently that if they can’t get him jailed, they’ll have him killed. I get that this sits behind conspiracy, but our country has done things like this before. I think it’s indicative of being desperate to retain control. I worry that we are on the cusp of outbreaks of regional violence and the Trump fanaticism scares me. I can’t say with certainty that if Trump died today, that there wouldn’t be rednecks with guns storming the streets. I also can’t say that if Trump wins, the left wouldn’t riot and start burning down cities again. It’s baffling we’ve allowed politics to define our character like this and I think it’s leading us to a really volatile situation nationally at a point where globally so much stuff is happening/about to happen that we desperately need to get our shit together and unify under a flag and brace for that storm.

"There's an argument to be made that the current levels of GHGs are already analogous to warmhouse to hothouse transitions. For those who don't know, we're currently in a warm interglacial period within a geological icehouse period. These icehouse/coolhouse periods have a habit of ending very abruptly due to forcing (the PETM is theorized to have been forced by volcanic activity for example). The current rate of warming is up to ten times faster than the onset of the PETM, which was considered a very abrupt rate of climatic change. Academics such as H.J. Schellnhuber have already conceded that we've pretty much ended the glacial cycle entirely, it's just a matter of lagging right now and waiting for the climate to fully terminate the current ice age. Nisbet, Manning et al. recently demonstrated that this ice age termination has already been occurring for over a decade based on atmospheric methane volumes (which continue to increase without explanation). This is perhaps one of the best arguments against other theorem such as regional cooling, proxy analogs based on present GHGs suggest it's simply not physically possible to observe any sustainable cooling responses as things stand.

"Except even Trump isn't a fascist - he just likes the mouth feel of it, like a good burger.

The situation is fundamentally different than any point before 2000 before the internet, and again fundamentally different than any point before 1960 before our second ""enlightenment"". We KNOW much more now. Or we can know much more. We have access to all information in seconds. We have also helped the worst assholes of the world to connect with each other and organize at the speed of light. Technology is advancing, not just internet but the science of mind control, propaganda, PR. Soon AIs will control what the masses think and perfect surveillance and robot crowd controll will provide perfect security. There are forces at work now that didn't exist before.

So fundamentally the fascism we see today (fascism as in the belief in inequality based on some identity) is more like a side show. It's more like overt ""faux fascism"". 

Both Hitler and Mousolini were nationalists, worked hard to improve their nations in the perverted way they did. This won't happen here. The fascists might rise to power but when quality of life doesn't improve (because that costs money and requires rational thought) they will get voted out again. Or simply removed by the same oligarchs because it was a nice side show but doesn't serve their purpose any more. Well unless they actually do go full on autocracy.

Ultimately this is an inefficiency and people with brains know it can be useful but doesn't really improve the ""health"" of a nation. 

I think we're hading more towards a kakistocracy, basically becoming completely useless, rudderless and insane. And any attempt for a party to change or a new party to form is quickly neutralized by the powers that be. But it's somehow being stabilized by this degeneration of culture.

"Buddhism has always anticipated collapse, collapse both of Buddhism ( did you know Buddhism is the only religion to predict its own demise ) than collapse of the world itself. 

The first is the collapse of Buddhism ( which is tied to the collapse of the current human civilisation ). The collapse of Buddhism was already prophesied the moment the first monk chose to break the Vinaya code and the Buddha decided to ordain nuns. These two things set Buddhism onto its trajectory of rapid decline. The Buddha out of compassion ( and at a plea ) ordained the first women to become nuns so that they can too enter the path into Arhathood. This however is a move that the Buddha was reluctant to do initially as doing so shorten the Age of Dispensation ( the Buddha can do nothing about this … this is kind of an in-bake law ). However by doing this the Buddha set in motion alongside already the first monk who broke the Vinaya into Buddhism’s inevitable decline. 

https://www.themindingcentre.org/dharmafarer/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1.10-Dharma-ending-age-piya.pdf

Now in some ways it did not really matter if the Buddha ordained nuns or not as Buddhism would inevitably decline anyway BUT it was accelerated by 500 years of decline as a result ( nothing the Buddha can do about it .. the Buddha still has to follow the rules of Nature )

This set in motion a second problem … the very moment an age of dispensation arises ( ie:- if Buddhism successfully restarts to become a religion that can outlast more than two or three generations ) the fate of civilisations itself and the world axis becomes tied to the now rerotating Wheel of Dharma ( the Wheel of Law ). The moment the Buddha set the Wheel of Law in motion when He gave the Dhammacakapvatana Sutta out of compassion for all beings with little dust in their eyes https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html,  this tied the entire world’s protection to this wheel ( prior to the re-rotation of the wheel the world was operating more by its own function )

Once again like the nun ordination, the Buddha was initially hesitant to teach ( both because it is difficult but also moving the Wheel of Law beyond Himself in a strong way ties the world to the wheel. Times with non sustaining dispensation were collapse free in a sense as the world has never been under the protection of the Wheel in a reliable and stable manner ). However He only taught and really moved the Wheel of Law due to compassion not only of the current people but for “later generations” after He saw everyone who could benefit from the teaching. He had to weigh out the benefits and drawbacks.

Once the wheel wobbles and fails entirely, the entire world ( which has for thousands of years been tied to the wheel of law directly or indirectly ) has to revert back to its normal state. This inevitably causes a so called “decline” in the world and collapse both of the ecosystem and the human world. The Buddhist prophecies are very very clear that starting from the 4th to 5th age ( the Buddhist prophecy describes 5 periods of the Wheel of Law, the first one got shortened to 500 years significantly due to ordination of women and each period slightly shortened from its original 1000 years due to immorality of monastics ) the world will enter decline and will end up in catastrophe.

The world will recover without the Wheel of Law ( but will generate very few Enlightened beings ) until the next Wheel of Law is rotated .. this time by Maitreya Buddha. However the recovery time is described in tens of thousands of years. 

So Buddhism deals with collapse very well. Pretty much baked into the teachings.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadFA1bTRmb0pXb1FhekE4bWFzY2dUWWZtcThMdGx1OFZMM1JacWNQdFk3emV5M0JlLWotX3djZUo2WEZxR3FNSk1sT2NsMi1YU1hvUFFaMjNwVGMzenc9PQ==

"Christianity, and perhaps the other Abrahamic religions, may face a reckoning when the collapse of the biosphere becomes apparent. There is the edict found in Genesis that gives mankind ""dominion"" over the Earth. \\*\\*""\\*\\****And God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.""***

The word for ""subdue"" in Hebrew is *kavash*, to literally put your foot on the neck of a defeated enemy. But the root word in Hebrew for ""have dominion over"" is *radah,* which relates to the meaning ""descend, go down, wander and spread"" or to ""walk among"".

As follows, ***""The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.*** (Genesis: 2:15 NIV)"" To ""work it"" comes from the word *abad,* which means ""to serve"", ""to till"", ie, to cause to flourish.

It's clear that the Biblical justification for man's domination of the Earth includes an order to tend, protect, and cause the Earth to flourish. And the Bible makes clear that this power is only delegated to Mankind;

***‘The earth is the LORD’s and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it’*** **(Ps. 24).**  
***‘Heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the LORD your God, the earth with all that is in it***\\*\\*’ (Deut. 10:14).\\*\\*  
***‘The land is Mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants’*** **(Lev. 25:23).**

It may become clear to many people of this faith that Mankind has broken this Divine Order, and used our Dominion over the Earth to poison and destroy it. And both the Old and New Testament makes clear that God will hold us accountable for such a crime.  
  
*Revelations 11:18: ""****The nations were filled with wrath, but now the time of your wrath has come****. It is time to judge the dead and reward your servants the prophets, as well as your holy people, and all who fear your name, from the least to the greatest.* ***It is time to destroy all who have caused destruction on the earth.”***

  
*Ezek. 34:2–4, 9–10 NIV: ""Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured.* ***You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally… therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock.""***

I can't help wondering if a new religion might spread rapidly in response to collapse though.

I mean, I have a certain amount of compassion and understanding for the Abrahamic hand wringing about sin, they just mostly focus on the wrong things. Buddhism gets a lot more right. While at core I am an atheist, I feel that the loss of community and compassion that has been one of the main by-products of growth obsessed mindsets (which includes most of the major religions, not just political economy) and if we had a spiritual shift where more become convinced that our current path is absolutely catastrophic, that we might avert the extreme worst case scenarios (not saying that a lot isn't already baked in by our past actions)...

"The outcome is a given, yes. And I couldn't care less what they actually announce. I am here for the same reason I go to any such gathering.

I am here to listen to people talk to eachother. That is where the real intel-gathering gold lies. I know the rhetoric the politicians will put out, but I want to hear what people say to eachother when they are with their fellows.

Often very enlightening. I do a lot of recon at various conventions, rallies, meetups, whatever. What actual people believe and talk about is much more important than whatever the hosts announce. Because ultimately, those are the people from which the results will come.

Is the party line being stuck to, or is it truly being *believed?*

In Las Vegas I often attened conferences by various elements of the Law Enforcement community, other stuff like Def-Con, conventions for real estate agents, investors, and certainly political parties. 

I grew up in California, and I can hit all the left talking points and be one of the gang. I've lived a long time in both Florida and Texas, and I can preech the red gospel with a Texas twang if necessary. I can sit down in the park and trade war stories from Oak Park with bangers and be at that same park on Sunday extolling the white virtues of Christian Nationalism, and right after I can go sit down at a lunch table with some post-graduate astrophysics students and make just enough references and chuckle at all the right times to hold my own long enough.

The best way to find out what people really think? Either ask them, directly, while being ""one of their own,"" or else listen to them talk when they believe they are surrounded  only by their own.

So, when I say I am ""covering"" the event, it is from the nitty-gritty ground level. Down in the weeds where the good stuff falls. I would never want to talk to Trump, but I would love to have lunch with his maid or driver...

"In Buddhism, one of the most important thing we teach people is all feelings of unhappiness and worry stems from:-

1. Craving for pleasurable things
2. Craving for becoming 
3. Craving for non becoming

Part of the reason we suffer when we are encountering tough social situations is that is I loved and unpleasant, so violates our desire for pleasurable things. It also directly threatens our sense of safety and self ( so threatened our craving for becoming ) and IF we are trapped in it and cannot escape so threatens our sense of non becoming ( in this case unpleasant becoming ).

Recognising this, all our distress and displeasure are internal. They are all driven by our own head, our own wants and desires.

Therefore the solution around this is mostly internal, with only some external ( Buddhism does teach that we have some external control ).

We have some external control and where we can of course we should try to fix it. For example our personal health situations which could be improved by exercise and better diet should be something we get a handle on. We should save more money if it is a monetary issue we can deal with ( the Buddha actually taught this by the way ). We can set aside if we have land a few trees for birds to stay in so we should.

However something as major as political and social changes are outside us as individuals so we should instead focus inwards on those things ( or move somewhere else, Buddhism does encourage renunciation and abandonment when things cannot be changed externally ).",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaW1TZ0VIZFkxZU5XR1VBdkxQR0djM0pyUXRSYndKTXFDaUpCZXo1RDM3LWVRNVo5UUZ4eFNwb1pVOWhIMEN6ZGRZb0FkQWxsYW45X0VHVmpMUTFJU1E9PQ==

"I think I've given you the wrong impression somewhere. I'm certainly not demonizing Joe Biden or the Democratic Party generally. What I said was, ""it's not out of the question that he registered Republican to vote against him just for the primary, potentially in spite of whatever political leanings he may or may not have had."" I did not claim he was Democrat, liberal, socialist, leftist, antifa or whatever else that would imply that he was aligned in some way with the Democratic Party or favored Joe Biden to win the election. What I was attempting to do was remind people that without adequate knowledge of a person's beliefs and motivations, we shouldn't assume that we know what they are. This is a fraught situation and we should approach it with cooler heads and some self-reflection. It is entirely possible that we could be pointing our collective finger at ""the other"" only to find us pointing at ourselves. 


And yes I picked an absurd example *because it was absurd but in this day and age not entirely out of the question.* Remember the Nashville bombing where someone believed the conspiracy theory about 5G so deeply they blew up an AT&T building? This is the dystopia we live in, where people, young, gullible, and easily swayed, could believe and potentially act on the craziest of ideas. 


I don't think that Never Trumpers who hate Trump enough to want to kill him still call themselves Republican after 8 years of him running the party. It's why the ranks of ""independents"" are swelling and the Republican party is 93+% in the bag for their candidate. On top of that, Never Trump Republicans tend be moderates and moderates don't have a track record of assassinating political candidates. My personal suspicion, completely unfounded of course, is that this shooter was trying to start a wildfire more than he was trying to kill Trump. Whether that's because he's jumped into the deep end of the right-wing internet cesspool or has been taken in by accelerationist beliefs, or even self-radicalized into an Islamic State jihadist, I can't say. Any of those things are possible. But it's also possible he thought the only way to save America from a future dictatorship is by committing an assassination. It's possible he frequents this subreddit and in dismay of the future decided to take matters into his own suicidal hands to give his life some meaning before he goes. All of these motivations are possible and maybe if we are lucky, we'll find out if one, or none, of them are true. But we shouldn't say we know with any certainty what his motivation is because of a single piece of information, like supposing because his parents are Republican (which CNN was reporting his mother is a registered Democrat and his father a Libertarian) and therefore assuming that piece of information gives any gleaning into his mindset.


I'll add that I'm a liberal in the classical sense, and while I don't label myself a Democrat, most of my political values do align with the Democratic Party. I think that Joe Biden has done a better job with the crazy state of the world that he was handed and far better than most anyone could possibly have done in the same situation, but he's a piss-poor salesman. I'm not sure if that changes your opinion of anything I've said, but I imagine we are probably more alike in our political opinions then dissimilar.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZVpvOFY4Mk5hNTVqb2pTQkdUQjNwUl9HSldvaFNhTElvYy1lbnVFS2hlemRBTGRNbG9VN3JhUk90X3ZwcHB3cXhRYzdpaW45d3pxMmVQd01CZ1pRbVVQUTZhWVRkMWJBWFdHd3V1TlFtYTQ9

"Students in school

Teacher:

"" Wow, it turns out that the boiler room can’t be turned off anymore, and people that aren’t us built the school out of bricks of flammable cancer, so we need you students to work as a group to figure out how to make the school safer, and to make sure everyone learns, the doors are going to be chained so leaving the school isn’t possible. Now your assignment is to save yourselves before the school burns down, or everyone dies from the heat. There are snacks in the fridge but you can only have them if you do an “unrelated bullshit worksheet”, or build more flammable cancer bricks, or report one of the other students and have them sent to time out.  Don’t worry, we did give you bottles of water, and the class bully has even been given a list of which water bottles have a special ingredient that is flammable cancer. Now, some of your classmates were told about the flammable cancer three weeks ago, but the flammable cancer company offered them candy to not talk about it or money if they told everyone that flammable cancer isn’t real. They will start the project having pizza, soda and ice cream with me in the front of the class, the rest of you can join us too, but you have to say “there is no such thing as flammable cancer” between bites. 

Now, you should probably all get started, good luck! I’m going to see if any of these keys I have that could unlock the doors for everyone open the active shooter emergency room I can hide in so I don’t have to watch you all suffer. The TVs are set to pornography, a video montage of our last school shooting, and touched by an angel. The brand new computer in the back room will feed you candy every time you watch the commercial. You could ask it for how to complete the project, but if you ask it the wrong way it will kill a random number of students, and if one of the pizza party kids is on the computer you have to wait.

But either way, while I do not want Trump, I personally fear the results of a Biden/Harris result even more, at least when it comes to personal freedoms. Now, it hopefully won't affect me much, because I am more than willing to violate the law to continue the way of life I have always been able to lead legally before, but it certainly could.

No matter what else, we move further and further away from the rights and freedoms we had 200 years ago every day. 

I don't have student debt, because that was a dumb idea, so why do I care about others who made that obvious mistake? 

More local manufacturing, the moves for that are actually threatening to hamper some of my existing income streams which depend on cheap overseas labor, which means that companies like DJI can put out quality products that no one else can compete with on price, and that is why they dominate the global drone market. Slave labor, basically. 

Safer climate? Please, that ship sailed long ago. Every human could vanish tomorrow and we still have about 6C of warming ""baked in"" to the equation. 

Which brings me to my final point. And that is simply the inevitability of global societal collapse. It is coming soon, most likely in the form of nuclear war due to climate and resource pressures. And that should be a persons sole focus right now. Preparing to survive the end of civilization.

What is the difference between Dave and someone here. From what I have read they are a documentary filmmaker who once ran for city council. They also basically self admit to making spin films for whomever paid them and only shifted once their moral compass started working.

They make some incredibly big policy claims and they do not have any of the professional background to doing so.

The following submission statement was provided by /u/f0urxio:

---

The UN report reveals the global population will peak earlier and lower than previously forecasted, with numbers reaching 10.3 billion by 2080 and declining to 10.2 billion by century's end. This adjustment, driven by declining birth rates, predicts 200 million fewer people by 2100 than earlier estimates. The shift could alleviate environmental pressures and lower demand for resources. However, an ageing population and shrinking workforce may strain public finances and healthcare systems, prompting the need for technological advancements and extended working lives.

"How come nobody is suggesting the powerful modern sonar that large ships use, especially military ships looking for Chinese and Russian subs? The sonar is so powerful on them, they create bubbles just outside that part of the ship. The whales are fleeing these powerful sonar broadcasts. 

If it's secret sonar technology, of course the U.S. military would ban anyone in the western world from talking about it. But it doesn't even have to be secret technology, they can just claim ""national security"" and that we either have the ability to detect Russian and Chinese submarines, with lots of whales and other sea life getting killed, or we just don't detect Russian and Chinese submarines. The U.S. will simply ban anyone in the U.S. from mentioning the negative effects of sonar,

People's knowledge of this can be a good indicator of just how much freedom to share information we the people actually have in the western world.

"> I agree on the cults popping up. That's already happening. But the theodicy question is completely irrelevant on the topic of faith beyond scholar discussions.

Nope. Asceticism in monotheistic religions is reserved for monks and nuns. They are the ""professionals"", doing it for everyone else in the flock.

Pastoralist religions, like mainstream monotheism, are focused on growth, wealth and power accumulation, and the belief that ""you deserve it"", with *it* being blessings from Sky Father, blessings which are material or high-status.

"America hasn't been a democracy in a very long time, they've just gotten a lot better at manufacturing consent. 

From the definition of fascism in Brittanica:

>Although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from one another, they had many characteristics in common, including extreme militaristic nationalism, contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism, a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a Volksgemeinschaft (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation.

Fascism is opposed to democracy. 

>And if you create the rules, and others find ways within those rules to get arou d your particular intent, you can't then decode you want to change the rule to benefit your side at the expense of the others.

I mean, most of us haven't had a hand in creating the rules and there are a lot of things politicians do both inside and outside the official rule of law that don't align with democratic principles.

"Title is somewhat inaccurate and is debately clickbait, especially as the article draws *significantly* from Catton without fully recognizing what Catton actually said about Malthus and the inadvertant errors he made. Otherwise, a fun, short, and accessible read. 

I cover this pretty directly in an older thread / book excerpt ([""Good Job, Homo Sapiens!"" & The Tragedy of Malthus](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/pzav6w/good_job_homo_sapiens_the_tragedy_of_malthus/)) from over three years ago here on r/collapse. 

I'm a stickler for citation and academic attribution, so direct quotes from Catton are provided below here, my emphasis in bold:

>*Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change, William R. Catton Jr. (1982)*

>**The Real Error** - 

>**Malthus did indeed err, but not in the way that has been commonly supposed. He rightly discerned “the power of population” to increase exponentially “if unchecked.” He rightly noted that population growth ordinarily is not unchecked. He saw that it was worth inquiring into the means by which the exponential growth tendency is normally checked. He was perceptive in attaching the label “misery” to some of the ramifications of these means. Where he was wrong was in supposing that the means worked fully and immediately. (That this was his error has not been seen by those who reject his views.)** 

>**Being himself under the impression that it was not possible for the human load to exceed the earth’s carrying capacity, Malthus enabled those who came after him to go on misconstruing continued impressive growth as evidence against, rather than as-evidence for, his basic ideas.** Carrying capacity was a concept almost clear to Malthus. He even sensed that the carrying capacities of earth’s regions had been repeatedly enlarged by human cultural progress.20 I**f he was not yet able to make clear to himself and his readers the distinction between means of enlarging carrying capacity and means of overshooting it, we do ourselves a serious disservice by perpetuating his shortcoming.** And we do just such a disservice by continuing to mistake overshoot for progress, supposing drawdown to be no different from takeover. By erring thus we prolong and deepen our predicament. 

>**Despite Malthus’s belief to the contrary, it is possible to exceed an environment’s carrying capacity—temporarily**. Many species have done it. A species with as long an interval between generations as is characteristic of ours, and with cultural as well as biological appetites, can be expected to do it. Our largest per capita demands upon the world’s resources only begin to be asserted years after we are born. Resource depletion sufficient to thwart our children’s grown-up aspirations was not far enough advanced when our parents were begetting, gestating, and bearing us to deter them from thus adding to the human load. 

>**By not quite seeing that carrying capacity can be temporarily overshot, Malthus understated life’s perils. He thus enabled both the admirers and the detractors of his admonitory writings to neglect the effects of overshoot—environmental degradation and carrying capacity reduction**. **In his analyses he assumed linear increase of carrying capacity. While this fell short of sustaining exponential growth of would-be consumers, it was, even so, a far brighter prospect than carrying capacity reduction",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaa1ZqdnpIalVFcjFUdFZKOHkwckk3VVdmOU9aUzVVOXl1S2p1WnRkaERZd0NmNGtWbGctN0ZHNUdVbW5VUmt4aGJVOVphRV9FdGpGR01VdlZLY2tQdU96RmRaVVpjUUJoVzVHMGFWaUhzRlE9

"I recently became friends with people who earn much higher than my own income, and that do air travel at least twice a year. And I was thinking that if I brought up how bad it is for the environment, I would probably just sound like I was bitter, considering I couldn’t even afford that if I wanted to. And of course, there’s benefits to experiencing new places; I did do a service trip to New Orleans to rebuild houses when I was in college, and I enjoyed discussing with this new friend just how powerful and soulful it was hearing a live brass jazz band down there. And, I’ve also pondered the morality of my own driving usage. There was a time when I was absolutely determined to find a job I could walk or bike to, and at one point, I was biking to work at a day program for the elderly. But then I would watch the seniors all get brought in on vans every morning and taken away every afternoon, and I realized that, even if I were walking/biking somewhere, the place where I was working would likely rely on automobiles in some way to keep functioning. And, is it moral for me to drive somewhere in my own state for pleasure, even a state park, if I’m unnecessarily burning fossil fuels? I’m not trying to be contrarian. I just really wonder if the combined effect of all of us plebs taking frequent drives is similar to the effect of the smaller percentage of people who do air travel (after removing the super-polluting private jet people), especially when you include the massive amount of resources needed to maintain roads, etc. ",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacFNacXRzQ2lqODJIZTVaMkdDYWF2ZGdZeF9fbWp4cllnRE15VnI2bkl5RE9SS3dMOGxrUXF4emFWcVNla3JiVElTMEozUF9ET1BLaWhzN2l3LVRyS2E3QVNDZGhNblh2VHd1V3FFMS1OaDQ9

There's a lot there in the planet's ""savings"" for us to draw on, but not infinitely so, and certain things (oil is a prime example) are nearing the stage where it will cost more to get out than it is worth.

"Location: Colorado USA

A friend from Chile messaged me asking about the past couple days and what it means. I had to explain that nobody really knows and that there's a lot of takes on the internet that might be coming from the Kremlin or whatever but November is still a long way away and nobody knows the future. But she was rattled. I don't think she's wrong. If the US falls to fascism it's going to affect the whole world in probably a bunch of ways but definitely accelerate the climate crisis and remove some or all of the disaster relief the US provides to other countries. Maybe she's also concerned for me, because she lived through Pinochet.

Completely separately, we had some sort of water issue the other day that I found out about on Reddit. Water company had sent an email but the email was shunted from the ""important"" folder by the email company. So that felt dystopian. After texting family and friends, I discovered few people know where their water comes from. Somewhat understandable given the bazillion other things we're all supposed to understand and keep track of, but another sign of things being sort of a house of cards.

On a positive note, I hiked high in the mountains to get out of the heat wave and observed native bee species on native wildflowers while there.

Ambiance.

**The 2024 Olympics saga** - my city's festival (again) was held three weeks in advance because we don't have enough snipers, drones, and ghetto mercenaries to secure two areas of France at the same time.

"Location: Western New York, USA

July 10th we got multiple tornado warnings due to the remnants of Hurricane berryl finally reaching us. Luckily we didn't have any in my area...I remember back in 2018-2020(can't remember exactly) when we got my first tornado warning I've ever seen in my life....now this year I've seen probably close to 5-7 of them. 2 of them just on July 10th. We are a hilly area...I have no idea how we can even get tornados....but they are coming. I thought for sure we would get fires first but it looks like we are going to get ALL of the different storms.

Pricing is still insane and I'm struggling to get by just like everyone else is. I'm sick of the record profits, I'm sick of the bull shit.

Someone shot at trump and it's everywhere but the 77 whales beached and 140 dolphins beached will barely scratch the headlines....

We are hitting 90°F again today. So far this month: 75, 83, 91, 89, 88, 89
, 85, 90, 89, 93, 76, 87, 87, 92, 90.

Average high: 86.93°F

Historical average for july: 81°F

We still have time to lower the average but I don't know how much it'll lower. I can post at the end of July with updated numbers.

I've been joking with EVERYBODY that we are going to be called ""New Texas"" soon instead of New York. No one cares or just laughs at me.


Every one around me is finally talking about every thing to do with collapse. Not all at once, and definitely not to the extent of having the realization of where we are and where we are going...but they are talking about it in pockets(kind of like how all the specialists each talk about their certain field but don't connect their field to another specialists field of work)

Family still denies mostly all of it(especially climate change). Believing societal problems are all bidens fault, ""trump will save us.""

No ones coming to our rescue.

For the past 3 years I've lived without an AC and minimal AC usage in my vehicles. A few weeks ago when we had 90°F+ for a whole week my wife finally forced me to get an AC. I was PISSED because I dont want to add to this bull shit but also if the animals don't get AC or a break from this why do we deserve it? Someone needs to feel what we are doing and while it may not have been essential that it was us to feel it....at least someone was. 

I know things are getting more dangerous and having an AC really just helps us survive this apocalyptic hell hole we are experiencing at a rapid rate but I was proud to know that I wasn't using an AC. Especially because most people I know would turn on the AC when it's only 70°F out. I try not to turn it on unless it hits 90°F out....which has been a lot more days than i thought it would be. Any time you see someone driving with their windows closed it's almost guaranteed there is AC running. Millions of people. It just fucking sucks.

I've talked about it before but I had quit drinking alcohol the day Russia invaded Ukraine. About 6 months later I decided ""why the fuck did I quit drinking."" Now for the past month in a half I have been sober. I've been dealing with some personal problems that have really made me question why I've quit drinking, and of course every thing going on right now in the world really makes me question it as well.

I know every one will say please don't start drinking again. At this moment I don't want to start again but fuck this shit is so hard and anyone who's raw dogging life is fucking strong as hell(I'm still smoking weed).",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcXVrZGNZSW9GcHRRTGU0UV9ocW5ZZENWcUtBdFVyaVh4aGp0dkFhOG5oem55c3IwLUp5bXFHT0FTT21yQ0dseFNFUURfV3d6clItUExPN0Etc1Fxdnc9PQ==

"Submission Statement: ""The workers are believed to have caught the virus through direct work with infected birds. They had mild symptoms including conjunctivitis or pink eye and respiratory problems, but none of them were hospitalized, the state said Sunday."" 

Collapse related because we are entering a period of increased international conflict, and in many places increased internal conflict, while climate change is creating more disasters where people lose homes or are otherwise in close proximity to each other such as in cooling centers, hospitals, refugee encampments, and migratory caravans, or people find themselves on the front lines of armed conflict. Thrown into the mix is a potential economic downturn from a collective international debt crisis, a lack of affordable housing, and lack of affordable food potentially leading to new collective spaces of bread lines, soup kitchens, and more numerous homeless encampments for people who have lost the means to provide for their survival in our current economic system, and we have a situation that is primed for Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu to spread wildly through the global population. We are vastly unprepared for this potential outcome.

Fortunately, the people who have been infected at least in the US this year have not had serious health complications (that I've taken note of at least), but the virus is also not adapted to infecting humans, *yet*. I think it's a matter of when at this point, not if. With the lackadaisical attitude for preventative health measures that most industries and even workers take rather than valuing the greater risk, more opportunities for infection and therefor mutation will occur. Even with an MRNA vaccine in an experimental stage ([https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/may/penn-researchers-develop-experimental-mrna-avian-flu-vaccine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/may/penn-researchers-develop-experimental-mrna-avian-flu-vaccine)), It may not be able to be produced in sufficient quantities and distributed in time if everything comes to a head anytime in the next year, especially if things go faster than expected™.

"While others have answered, perhaps an analogy would clarify this.

The Earth bank account has some arbitrary total value, say $1,000,000, and produces say $3,000 annually in interest.

We humans are spending almost $6,000 a year. This doesn't seem like a lot compared to the total, but it is depleting the principle.
It may take a seemingly long time to deplete the total principle, but remember that there is less interest each following year because of the shrinking principle, and we continue to grow our spending (practically exponentially in the last couple centuries).

The analogy is missing pollution and other forms of degradation, but for illustrative purposes tells us the same as the article: something bad is going to happen at some point if we continue as usual, and as we love to say probably faster than expected.

"No, not the most friends with guns. Sensible, honorable friends that stand aside and allow people to handle things fairly, one-on-one, with their own guns, fists, knives, whatever. Doesn't have to be guns, it just has to be without the interference of law.

The rule of law is what allows a mod of majority opinion to enforce things on others. A person has no right to walk somewhere unless they also possess the person capacity for violence that allows them to walk there by the fact that no one wants to challenge their assumption of that right 

In short, you don't rely on laws to stop people from somehow interfering with you or your property. *You* stop them. And when you reach the point where you no longer can... someone else takes over from you. 

I think, perhaps, you may want to watch more nature documentaries, or something to help you see how the natural world functions without the artificial construct we call civilization. 

Because I don't want to be civilized. Sounds like being domesticated...

Both are the same. Either enforcing security with violence by a large number of people, or enforcing security with laws backed by a large number of people. At the end of the day, you are still trying to tell others what they can and cannot do. And if they don't do what you want them to, well, you put them in jail.

"Your definition is certainly better, but isn't the definition universally shared. It's also something that applies to anyone who has ever ordered something.

"Location: Western NC, USA

The drought and heat of June and July have dried-out my spring to a trickle. I had never had trouble in five years prior at this site, so the first time I ran the spring box dry from watering container plants was a surprise! Since then (about 4 weeks ago), I have run-dry again when trying to wash clothes or run the dish washer, even waiting for what I though would be sufficient recharge time. This week, I am holding off on even a shower until the rain returns (hopefully tomorrow) and will let the dishes and laundry pile-up until more than a solid day of rain falls.

Politics: I went for my daily long walk yesterday and saw over ten trucks flying an ""F Joe Biden"" flag.

Economy: Yesterday morning I went out for breakfast with my dad and we talked about numerous topics over coffee and omelets. *Keep in mind that he typically votes Republican but stays rather in the middle over most issues.* I told him about people at my apartment complex getting new lease offers with rent offers skyrocketing by $100-300 a month. He responded in a way that made me almost fall of my chair. ""It's all corporate greed. People can't afford homes now and they can't afford apartments. The same goes for groceries.""

"You can't give an eli5 for why he's a hack, because making the story acceptable for Christians and Children is why so many people today ride his dick. I'll give a brief but accessible explanation, but it is going to be NC17.

____________________________________________________

To start off, Schools during this time period where different from the way they are now. It's probably closer to say they were a mix of a religious cult, a political party, a frat house, and academic institution.

So to even start talking about Aristotle, You've got to start with Socrates. Now, I've read works attributed to Socrates (I'll come back to this later), and I mean to tell you, he's added some great bangers to Philosophic tradition. Classic ideas like the best form of intimacy is fucking between the soapy thighs of young boys, that maybe Athenian Democracy isn't as good as dictatorship, and the development of the, ""It was just a hypothetical, Bro, why are you sentencing me to death.""

Of course, given that there was a little matter of a civil war between Oligarchs and supporters of Democracy, the fact he had incredible Rizz wasn't enough to save him, which is ironic. Especially, given that he was a war hero and shit.

___________________________________________________

Anyway, that brings us to Plato, a pupil of Socrates. Now Socrates was known for his incredible Rizz, which included never writing anything down, because that shit was for women. It also included throwing banger orgies, so Athens forgave him, but not before he was dead. 

Now Plato is most famous for playing with one handed shadow puppets in a cave. I'd explain more, but it's not as important as the next part. Plato, having no Rizz, was bitchless. That means that he had the time to write things down. Now, of course being as personable as six month old spam in an Alabama summer, he discovered that his ideas sold better when he attributed them to other people, namely Socrates. In an ultimate irony, Christians would later adopt this tradition, and much like Plato, they would end up dying from a fatal lack of rizz. He, unfortunately, passed this on to his greatest student, Aristotle.

_____________________________________________________

Finally, we arrive at Aristotle. Most famous for accusing other people of being illogical. In order to explain the height of his hackdom, we need to introduce one more character.

_____________________________________________________

Alexander. Now, unlike, Aristotle and Plato, Alexander wasn't so much a talker, he was more of a do'er. Anyway, he conquers the known world. He also gives a really good fucking speech, and if you've never heard it do yourself a favor and listen, I'll link it below. Cliff notes, he says, ""Bitches, I did this shit, you were there, now nut up and finish the job"".

He dies. Everyone is sad.

____________________________________________________

Now, this is where Aristotle realizes he's done wrong. He ain't got the Rizz that Socrates had, he ain't got the stones of Alexander. So, facing the realization that *Alexander is dead*, he decides it's time to fuck off to his country estate rather than answer to Athens.

______________________________________________________________

SS: Related to collapse as perfluorocarbons, the gases in question, have a far longer latent time in the atmosphere than CO2 (10-50 000 years vs 200 for CO2) and are more potent greenhouse gases to boot, just adding further to the massive positive feedback loop of emissions and warming that we have found ourselves in. Especially troublesome as aluminum production is behind some of these emissions and that process is needed for a lot of renewable energy tech, showing how screwed we are in another way. And the authors of the article suggest carbon trading as a solution? Sound like a game of shifting responsibility to me.

"I think it all relates to the adaptive cycle, during the growth phase there is an arms race to increase complexity and consume more resources to literally grow.  That transitions into stagnation or conservation phase when behavioral sinks take over to reduce individual energy expenditures in order to maintain eroi as resources diminish and competition increases due to overshoot.  Then the collapse phase occurs, faster than the growth phase due to the Seneca cliff effect,  where the population comes back into equilibrium with the newly diminished carrying capacity due to overshoot.  At this point there are 2 outcomes for a species, extinction or reorganization.  Assuming reorganization, new traits will be selected for according to environmental pressures that are very different from the dominant traits selected for by the old paradigm.  A species may exist in a poverty trap for a very long time post collapse where they will either slowly develop traits that allow growth to resume or fade into extinction at the mercy of environmental conditions beyond biological organisms physical abilities to adapt",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYXBuQnFFMXdiZUdNb0RxTE5Ia29VMmVBUjcyRDg4V3N0VE50M0dGYndXVXNuVHAwTmtHSzlBbjR1Q2ZHRzRPM0ZQb1dhbnZOY2hXUHJmX1ptZmFfcGc9PQ==

SS: Related to collapse as the rapid melting of ice across the planet is rivalling natural processes that take much longer in terms of disrupting the rotation of the Earth and thus the length of a day. While the discrepancy may be in the milliseconds or lower, this threatens various exercises that govern our modern lives and require precise timekeeping such as GPS, financial transactions, and internet traffic. The slowing rate has increased to 1.3 milliseconds/century since 2000, and we may well end up slowing Earth’s rotation down faster than expected just like everything else. Obviously not the worst thing ever for collapse, but the fact that our actions are affecting the Earth System this much is eye-opening.

"Actually, aircraft encounters with turbulence involving storm systems are lower than ever. The reason is that reduced minima with aircraft separation allow for more deviation with greater ease. So, flying in bad weather is actually safer today than it has ever been. We also have far superior image products, including all sorts of ground-based and air-based radar and satellites and of course technology that allows PIREPS to databases in real time. It's almost unfathomable, but just a few decades ago, when you flew you basically had a weather forecast and maybe a sounding, and that was it. You got your weather via ground stations and flight service stations and local ATIS reports. Today, due to endless streams of data all over the atmosphere, there are much more and much better tools in use constantly, and it allows the arena to be a lot safer for all participants. 

No matter if you're in aviation or not, anybody who watches a whole gaggle of commercial airliners poke through holes in storm systems on radar gets a absolute fucking kick out of it. I mean it's really something to see. The pilots will be in a holding pattern over a fix and they'll ask, yeah we'd like to fly 10 miles east, we want to point and take a look again and see if we can find a gap through that storm. And we say, go for it! Pathfinders can then fly through the storm and typically you can fit a few planes through that gap. It's safe. But this was impossible just a few decades ago. This is all possible because of onboard radar systems. 

I've even seen TCAS procedures be used for separation in situations involving bad storm systems, but that's a bit out of the scope of what we're talking about... 

Now, with all of that said, I believe what you are talking about is [clear-air turbulence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear-air_turbulence), which the media has been reporting on.  Clear-air turbulence doesn't involve a mesoscale storm system. It's particularly notable in the northern latitudes due to the North Atlantic jet stream, especially in the [NAT tracks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Tracks). It's worth reading about. In 11 years, I've only encountered severe turbulence once. It was pretty intense; you could hear it in the pilot's voices.

When I was at ZNY, I worked in two different control areas, which is rare. One was a busy domestic radar area, and the other was an offshore non-radar oceanic area. This area dealt with a lot of the North Atlantic flows into other areas and off to Shanwick, Gander, Piarco, etc., from Jacksonville Center, Miami Center, and Boston Center.

New York Center runs the two oceanic areas, technically ZWY. Turbulence is still pretty rare across that area, but reports are increasing. Bad storms have always been associated with turbulent rides; nothing new there. Planes avoid them, asking for deviation clearances sometimes hundreds of nautical miles away if the flows are impacted that much, especially in the non-radar oceanic environment. Pilots talk to their company dispatchers and air traffic controllers, so they're well-informed of turbulent areas. It's not like they're flying blindly into a pocket of air and suddenly exclaim, ""Holy crap!"" That's exceptionally rare. But it does happen, which is why you should keep your seat belt fastened at all times.

A big part of this is the unsaid responsibility of the controller. The primary goal of the air traffic controller is safety, but it also involves efficiency and expediency. Avoiding turbulence is part of all these. A good controller works with the aircraft to manage their sector of airspace or area of control, and even more so if working in a tower on the ground where the whole pattern might need reconfiguring. It's a fascinating field. The fact that people don't know much about it is a good indication that it's working well.

"Seeing society decline/regress behind technologies and the access to them isn't enshittification. That's just collapse.


Enshittification is the process where new technologies are slowly transformed into useless junk due to corporate and financial interests slowly turning all the useful features of a technological development into a money-extracting waste of time and energy.


500 channels on dish/cable but only 3 are worth watching? Enshittification.


500 ""free"" and hard coded apps on your phone that you cannot uninstall, but you only use three? Enshittification.

"Perhaps it's the easiest answer, but my answer would be when we had to start using the Haber-Bosch process to feed our population

We have a lot of natural gas, but it's still not sustainable on human timescales, and we can create hydrogen (which is reformed from the natural gas) with blue methods, but that is still energy intensive. So when we had to move to synthetic nitrogen instead of bird poop, that was big indication our population is not sustainable in any longterm way. And perhaps it's not worth stressing over that at the time - you don't know what the future will hold (perhaps there's a way to create infinite H2 and no consequences to the process!), except that people will starve without food NOW. But now we've found out what the future holds, which is climate change from fossil fuel usage and ever-EROEI-diminishing resources.

I really like the book 'The Alchemy of Air' as a look at the history of this, from the guano to Haber-Bosch, and its effects on the world wars given it can also create explosives with Ammonium Nitrate. Would highly recommend giving that a read",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWmpIcHZ0b1NPcmh1R1c5MHNYNXM5Y3pYRXUyWUtYREVRS0VVSnh6Ylh1bDdkeU1tV2tfQmFDc1ZGWlVpSFY5eTdnY2d6dEtRcGROTzNWNy1abV9NZEE9PQ==
"Wait, this is one of the most upvoted threads here this week? Listen, most of the material here isn't worthy of this sub, hurricanes are a thing and always have been. Yes, this was the earliest cat 5 (and cat 4) hurricane EVER, but that isn't what hit Houston, where I live, it was a regular cat 1, which is hardly an unusual occurence.

It sucks, it really does, but I've been through worse hurricanes, almost everyone here has. Didn't have power for two weeks after Ike, wasn't the end of the world. Personally I ENJOY hurricanes, I love the comradery and campiness of it as work is cancelled, I like gathering together, drinking and playing board games. If you had ANY foresight, you stuffed some coolers with ice and food, but even then, you aren't going to starve, you could still go to the store and grab some non-perishables, you could stuff coolers full of ice, the vast majority of homes have gas stoves so you can still cook, but this is the first storm I've seen where people are acting like McDonald's is the only option for food, willing to wait hours in line at the drive-thru burning gas.

"There is one way that both creates it, transports it to the field, applies it and mixes it with the soil already present in a easily plant available form. Moreover, it's extremely scalable, even to the global scale and to less developed nations. And it's kinda telling that you didn't think of it and/or don't seem to be aware of its potential. The ""tricky part"" is that it requires eventually very similar amounts of energy.

I am speaking about legumes used in regenerative agriculture. The energy use is an interesting fact that seems to be ignored in so many of the still prevailing technocratic discussions about ecological issues. People only see the energy we humans produce and transport around and almost entirely ignore the energy flows the ecosystem provides for us.

Haber-Bosch, like so many processes to date is ultimately due to the carbon pulse. We use abundantly available energy from fossile sources to power things at an energetic level that is far beyond the previously sustainable level. We turn gasoline into fertilizer with which we produce yields also higher than in the previously sustainable system. We borrow the sunlight put into the ground over the course of millions of years to increase the energy and material flow of things that do also flow without it and also powered by sunlight.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUEY5bjd3cUlSR3AyUHhCWlM4MzcwMG5UM0c4S1NfdF9iTDFSc09EdWxueURWVzc2WTZ0VVVnUldDQzFxOUNEb3FlVzdSdVU0V0VKbVl1aXlidXBuUEE9PQ==

"I live in North Queensland, Australia. Every summer is more brutal than the last. We seem to get weeks long heatwaves, with horrible humidity. As soon as I get out of a cold shower, I'm sweating again as I towel off 
There's no relief..
I try not to use the air con unless I really, really have to. But this summer I had it on for nearly a whole week, and for the worst three days I didn't leave my one, air-conditioned bedroom pretty much at all. When I had to get food I planned it like a military operation! Cold towels on my head and around my neck, umbrella for shade, cold water in a spritz bottle, a hand fan, just anything for relief. 
We're in the middle of our winter now and it's nowhere near what I remember as a kid. Usually I'd be able to see my breath on the coldest mornings, not anymore. 
Mind you, down south is freezing cold, weather's just all over the place I guess. 
However, I find myself dreading summer, more and more,  every year. But still, you can't constantly live in air con up here. It's unhealthy for your body to go from hot to cold to hot again.

I'm lucky in the sense that I've been already burned out in the chicks-sex-booze-party-holidays on the beach-consumption-social life-work circle long ago, so I kinda retired, I bought a small parcel in a somewhat deserted place well before the covid, I bought solars, I have independent water supply, and I started to develop a low profile, self-sustainable, lonely life. And found my inner peace in this very simple, slow life without much social interaction, I enjoy taking care of my land, growing food, I enjoy wandering the forests collecting edible wild plants and mushrooms, etc.

Funny thing is, I did not even know back then that's called prepping until the covid came and I started to dig into that kind of information and I started to study sustainability-related topics, how someone can prepare for emergencies, stuff like that.

"Hm, I understand your scepticism. It would be a fascinating research question. I do think, one aspect why it hasn't been tried before could be because it's extremely labor intensive and maybe it's only profitable, in terms of food output, with modern cultivars. 

Perhaps we simply didn't have the free labor density before, and then our development took a turn where armies had to be maintained to secure the (then still) scarce resources and where then other tech came in to take the functional role of increasing nutrient density (Haber-Bosch) and all of a sudden we were locked into the capitalist techno-dictatorship we have now that tries to solve everything based on extraction and progressing tech with the surplus to drive more extraction and sometimes solve existential questions, if it's convenient... Now that we have the labor density, people prefer to believe the lies of the extractors, because if everybody just digs enough, everybody can eventually be free, supposedly...

Edit: I do also have a thought about the free market. I think the problem is that companies are individual entities that have to fight against other such entities. As long as one such entity can't extract enough capital to guarantee its survival to the share holders, there is no viable option to refill common goods (due to race to the bottom situations). Hence, the stuff every company profits from, even down to care work, deteriorates increasingly, until the non-commodifiable stuff is gone. It seems as though ecosystem services, or nature's contributions to people still aren't commodified enough to be active as economic entities reflecting the limited pool of nature's entities.

"Exactly. Peter Zeihan (a renowned geostratigist used by many industries and government organizations) talks about the impossibility of going green based simply off the materials NOT existing, the capacity to manufacture within acceptable costs NOT existing (e.g. an EV sedan costing luxury vehicle prices or an EV SUV well into the six-figure range thus not pragmatic for the average consumer), and the impossibility of delivering an all green solution to underpin civilizations energy requirements. 100% EVs alone cannot be achieved. That’s before we even consider the charging infrastructure, green energy and infrastructure for industry, homes, and public. The world would have to rip everything out and replace it with components made from materials that simply do NOT exist in the volumes we need anywhere earth.What he doesn’t mention, but what you are concluding, is exactly what this means.

The idea of all green is an ill-informed pipe-dream that amounts to nothing more than idealistic value signaling. As nihilistic as it sounds, EVs are nothing more than another consumable to capitalize on others value signaling. It’s not going to change a d*mn thing. The only practical current solution to energy needs is fossil fuel… The world needs significantly fewer people (probably no more than a few hundred million) before we can think about “going green.”

Here’s an idea; counterintuitively double down on fossil fuels to energize quintupling down on technological research and development for hydrogen, fusion, & artificial fossil fuels and direct-air carbon capture. If we make it, Great! If not, it doesn’t matter anyway. No reason to restrict ourselves.

"Nuclear is not infinite. In fact, uranium supply is limited, \\~200 years of reserves by the current volume of consumption.

Now, nuclear power provides only \\~10% of global electricity, so you want to provide all electricity with nuclear power plants, scale it up to 10x, and the reserves shrink to \\~10 years.  
So if we had 4400 nuclear plants in 2010 instead of the \\~440, we've already exhausted the uranium reserves.

Furthermore, not all the energy we use is in the form of electricity, only 20% is electricity.

You can't power cars, trucks, planes with nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors are too heavy and big for that. Efficient storage of electricity is something that's still not solved, the energy density  of batteries is a joke compared to fossils.  
Commercial ships at least theoretically could be powered with nuclear reactors, but there's a very real reason why there aren't nuclear reactors in every big ship, and why there aren't mobile reactors on every street corner: security.

Fissile materials are extremely dangerous, and they are present in large quantities in nuclear reactors. Just imagine what could happen if a terrorist pirate group hijacked a container ship and get their hands on a few 100 kgs of uranium - they can pulverize the uranium, combine that with 40-50 kgs of TNT in a dirty bomb, put in on a chessna, fly over a mid-sized city, or Manhattan, and boom, the radioactive dust settles down, and the area will be uninhabitable for a decade, because there's no way we could clean up all that uranium dust from the streets.",r/collapse,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnTVpvQ1lmZWFzNS0xLWtXdlJZbmdaUVZhZXlrMW5iSV8wR2h2dkhkUGxJaGRCMkhrZ05oN2tLUV93SEpxaE11bTRNUjVDQ09mRC0yeS1aeWx6OTdmQi1MMl9fUy1aN3Fhb3V3ZE0yMWxLQW89

"And when we have less oil, all of our energy will have to be funneled into food production simply to stay alive. And even then we will struggle. Food production has become so energy intensive with fertilizer production that we won't be able to manage growth. No more inventing. No more discoveries. Simply working to stay alive.

I agree with the general sentiment, but stop buying cheap headphones that break, lol. If you research, I'm sure you can find decent ones that are sturdier, no?

"Labor is an interesting aspect - I'm not sure how expensive labor was when we had the food crisis which brought on synthetic fertilizer, I would imagine at the time manual labor was highly sought after compared to now with so many sectors automated? I guess one good part of a labor-intensive process like legumes and plants (can it be automated much?) is the low startup costs, compared to building an ammonia plant

"> As someone living in southeastern Europe these last few weeks have been nothing but horrible. 

Tropical nights too. 

I've covered most windows now, so I'm a caveman living by the 60 Hz flickering light of my displays. 

I've also moved my air fryer outside, on the the balcony. 

It's hot. I can take it, even when I lose sleep, but I know many people who are at risk. 

I'm trying to take my time and observe the crisis. Any crisis is a good stress test, if it's not collapse, so I get to see what past errors blossom into. For example: lots of bad urbanism and second-hand American Dream is now becoming an asphalt and concrete hot desert.
