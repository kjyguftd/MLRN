"This type of drone almost certinally receives no human guidance after launch.  
There are some very high tec systems that can use automatic optical guidance through their entire flight through terrain recognition, but it is unlikely that this drone uses such an expensive system.  
Other tactical drones use optical tracking with human targeting, but strategic drones are not well suited for that due to the problems of communicating over long distances.  
It is most likely using a positioning system, coupled with inertial navigation as this can be done cheaply, with readily available equipment that is resistant to jamming as an entire system, even if the positioning system is often jammed.",r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYVZ4Sk0xdDBMMEg4dmRGZ3gtVkhKOUlBenJpTHZtdHpzUmpDcUMwQXpZdWk1dm9saFV4bUxtWXlpajhoOUs1WnNqMjQ3QlFMMW5hZERRTEhxNmkxNnc9PQ==

"I actually like talking politics because I like finding common ground with people.

I absolutely do believe you. I would like to tell you why.

So here‚Äôs my life story. Keep with me, because it‚Äôs a little long.

My first exposure to the concept of war, guns, explosions, the wider world, the concept of geopolitics, crime, cartels, England, Germans, geopolitical opinions came from Cars 2.¬†I completely didn‚Äôt know that works isn‚Äôt always daisies and roses. I was five at the time.

There‚Äôs a lot of conclusions that, funnily enough, I can retroactively draw from this movie. It‚Äôs funny how many conservative themes this movie had:
Electric is the future, but people do take advantage of this transition. Billionaires don‚Äôt have your best interests in mind. Racing benefits from tourism, and vice versa. Controlling oil reserves in the future is Important. There‚Äôs something called climate change.¬†There‚Äôs something called Intelligence agencies and the military. Oil cartels. The concept of torture. Littoral combat ships can be referred to as little crappy ships.

I‚Äôve always been in this politically homogeneous suburban city. I was told by my parents that we were middle class. And I believed that, because I knew people that who lived in brand new, Moroccan-style houses and people who rented them. I thought apartments were for the poor, because I never saw them. Turns out that was false. Home ownership wasn‚Äôt as common as I thought. The world wasn‚Äôt as equal as I thought. Not everyone could afford a college education. I was more fortunate than most, because both my parents were college educated, and the suburban town I lived in was upper middle class. We were more middle class, but the median household income was 110k.
¬†
Pre fourth grade, I, in essence, thought that outright racism had been ended by MLK. I didn‚Äôt think about the effects of the financial crisis of 2008. All I knew was Obama, and he‚Äôs black, and he‚Äôs the president, so that‚Äôs how I knew that racism was no mostly no more. ‚ÄúMostly‚Äù because I thought that mostly all white people were not racist. And the racist people aren‚Äôt actually racist, they‚Äôre just misguided. Plus there‚Äôs not a lot of them anyway so I wouldn‚Äôt care that much. Turns out that was wrong.¬†

Plus, I had all these East Asians and Indians friends. They‚Äôre smart and I‚Äôm friends with them. That‚Äôs how I thought I knew I wasn‚Äôt racist. But I still thought that it must suck to be black, because people are racist, plus you would have dark skin. I had some internalized racism. But I thought there was no way I was racist (because I knew about not being racist, and racism just came from ignorance). That was also wrong. I realized that a lot of other progressives had also internalized that stuff too.

Politics basically entered my life in 2016. I was in fourth grade.
I‚Äôve basically seen blue vs red as good vs racism all my life. And Trump was told to be the big bad racist American.¬†

I thought since progressivism would wins, Hillary should be elected. Plus, I thought there would be no way that what Trump said would resonate with people.

Then Trump got elected, and it shook that belief that ‚Äúprogressivism‚Äù always won. (Again, I was in fourth grade) Did this mean that progressivism isn‚Äôt always right?! wHaT? I equated conservatism with moral bad. But Trump didn‚Äôt make everything morally bad, and then he didn‚Äôt build the border wall, which I thought was a good idea, even though the way
he sold it was deliberately otherizing towards Mexico.

Then Trump killed Soleimani (The Quds Force major). This was a touchpoint momement for me which I agreed with. I had always agreed with the war on terror more than the average Bernite.

Even so, I still equated conservatism with racism. And therefore it would be bad.
Covid, capital riot, Biden, midterms, my opinions didn‚Äôt change. In fact, they were reinforced.

But invasion of Ukraine happened, and my information gathering went into hyperdrive. I instinctively disagreed with Russia because they‚Äôre a geopolitical threat of the US hegemony. And I do think that the US hegemony is a net good.

I‚Äôve been trying to understand more about the world rather than just the basic LA Times and New York Times diet I‚Äôve been getting.¬†

Trump‚Äôs back on the ballot, so I really wanted to understand why people thought that way.

I didn‚Äôt see those videos, because I guess I‚Äôve been in a partial echo chamber. The BLM riots were really glossed over and talked about more in an abstract, good vs evil sense.¬†

"In case anyone is curious, the IRA used gun trucks early in the troubles, which were similar to the ones used in Vietnam. They'd add armour plating to trucks and stick DShKs and M2s on them, sometimes 2-4 of them, along with multiple members armed with AR18s/M16s. 

They'd ride around the countryside watching for helicopters before opening fire or, if possible, coordinating with another truck to ambush the helicopter along it's route.

This was very successful. They took down a couple helicopters, but more importantly, they harrased the helicopters into staying out of certain areas.

The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote.

"So what about the bombing of civilian centres in all the global conflicts of the last century? Everyone‚Äôs fine with the allies bombing Dresden killing 25,000, nuking Japan killing up to 200,000, the countless Middle Eastern cities levelled by Western forces. But this is where you draw the line? What did those thousands upon thousands of civilians have to do with the conflicts they were thrust into by ‚Äúthe good guys‚Äù?

You post a lot about the Ukraine war, so you think Ukraine is absolved of all sins of war? That they don‚Äôt kill civilians? Why do you support their cause against what they perceive as a foreign invader to their land? Crimea seems pretty set on being Russian after it‚Äôs illegal occupation no?

>Russia is recruiting 30,000 new soldiers a month to make up for the ones thrown into the meat grinder in Ukraine, a top Ukrainian intelligence official said this week.

"Perhaps most of you don't know this Ukrainian armored vehicle as well as you do the BTR-4, so it's worth a summary:


The BTR-3 is an eight-wheel drive armored personnel carrier developed in 2000 and 2001 by an international consortium. The companies involved in the project include the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau of Ukraine, Adcom Systems of Abu-Dhabi, UAE, and the State Scientific Technical Centre of Artillery & Rifle Arms of Ukraine. Although somewhat similar in appearance to the Soviet BTR-80, the BTR-3U is an all-new production vehicle rather than an update of the existing in-service vehicle.

Equipment design:
The standard equipment of the BTR-3U also includes hydraulically amplified powered steering on the front four road wheels and a central tire-pressure regulation system that allows the driver to adjust the tire-pressure to suit the terrain being crossed. The BTR-3U is fitted with French Michelin tires.

The BTR-3U engine compartment consists of a Deutz BF6M1015 diesel developing 326 hp coupled to an Allison MD3066 fully automatic transmission. The power pack and transmission are fitted by the Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau with the technical assistance of the Deutz AG and the Allison Transmission companies. The engine compartment is fitted with an automatic double-action fire extinguishing system.

The vehicle is fully amphibious, propelled when afloat by a single water jet mounted at the rear of the hull. To prepare the vehicle for water, the driver erects a trim vane and switches on the bilge pumps from within the vehicle.

The troop compartment accommodates six soldiers who enter and leave the vehicle by a door in either side of the hull. The lower part of the door folds downward to form a step, with the upper part opening forwards. There are also hatches in the roof and firing ports with associated vision devices provided in the sides and front of the vehicle. An air conditioning system is fitted as standard to ensure crew comfort in hot conditions.


Armament: The BTR-3U is fitted with the one-person KBA-105 ""Shkval"" unified fighting module which can accommodate 30mm gun, 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, 30mm automatic grenade launcher and anti-tank guided weapons. This module was developed by the State Scientific Technical Centre of Artillery & Rifle Arms of Ukraine. The Shkval fighting module design is versatile, but can also be used with another turret.

The Cockerill CSE 90LP with 90mm Cockerill LP
The KBA-105 one person manned turret with 30 mm ZTM-1 dual-feed autocannon that has 350 rounds of ready-use ammunition or Stiletto turret with 30mm ZTM-2.
A total of 2,500 rounds are carried for the 7.62mm coaxial machine gun.
The 30 mm AGS-17D grenade launcher is mounted on the left side of the turret, having 29 rounds of ready-use ammunition, with additional 87 rounds being carried in reserve (three magazines, each containing 29 rounds).
Cockerill CPWS 30 turret with 30mm autocannon.
Six 81 mm electrically operated smoke/aerosol grenade launchers are mounted three either side of the turret rear and firing forwards.
The sighting systems include a commander's 1PZ-3 observation periscope and a TKN-4S Agat stabilised sight which is integrated with the missile fire control system.
BTR-3DA has BM-3M Shturm-M weapon station armed with ZTM-1 30mm autocannon, KT-7,62 machine gun, KBA-117 30mm grenade launcher, six smoke grenade launchers 902B Tucha, and ATGM system, Barrier.

"[https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA388153.pdf](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA388153.pdf) A document on suggested and required changes in the training procedures for crews which will operate the A3 variants of the M2/M3 as the training procedures for the earlier variants weren't seen as good enough to teach the old crews on how to best use it. On the bottom of page 6 it mentions some new tasks that the crew need to perform compared to on the older models, where the auto-tracker is mentioned: ""There are other tasks such as operate auto-tracking \\[...\\]"". This is also mentioned in Appendix B on page 23: ""071-000-0005P Operate Auto-tracking on an M2A3 BFV \\[combined in all firing  
tasks\\]"". On page 4 the new FLIR system that is used for the auto-tracking is also mentioned ""Improved Bradley Acquisition Subsystem (IBAS). The IBAS, a second-  
generation forward-looking infrared (FLIR), replaces the ISU. The IBAS is used for  
target acquisition and other situational awareness functions."" Modern IRST systems also use the already existing thermal camera which the gunner where it allows to track heat signatures which the gunner can see rather than the older version of an IR sensor that you mention which work more or less interdependently, only telling you if it sees something and being able to lock onto it, rather than actually showing you the image.

"Russian storage and equipment numbers has become more and more interesting to me over the past year or so. I think its the key for Ukraine to wear down this gigantic stockpile to such a degree Russia wont be able to mount serious offensive actions with enough quality, and that the lack of armored quality reduces the potential effectiveness of the attacks. Ofcourse a T-62 is still deadly, but Russia has a higher chance of capturing its 23th Oleksandrivka in Donetsk and the random treelines up in Luhansk if their armor is in a better shape that what is currently the case

Its also not really something Russia can fix. You exactly cant just spawn in more vehicles so this soviet-arsenal theyre fielding is a card they can only play once, and as long as Ukraine gets the aid they need (which is a whole other case), then it will be interesting seeing how Russia will adapt to this. Im guessing they will just keep attacking still but with even more emphasis on infantry since they seemingly is fine with killing thousands of their dudes every month. It helps that a bunch are mercenaries from other countries Im sure, despite how inhumane that is

Theres also the future implications of it. Regardless of what happens in Ukraine over the next few years, the big advantage Russia had over basically any country in Europe was this absurd number of armor.

"They often used to be off the shelf racing drones.

The battery, however, is far, far higher capacity than in a racing drone.

"Two ways: 
(1) a long range recon drone team (fixed wing) spots targets of interest, hands them off to nearby strike drone teams. These drones can loiter for a long time, and have very good stabilised optics that can zoom in very far to spot targets. They are often also infrared-vision enabled, and so can spot troops trying to hide and move around in forests and such (Russians frequently do this in a lead up to an assault, to concentrate troops and get them closer to the contact line).

(2) a strike drone team spots one themselves, using their spotter recon/target tracking drone (almost always a quadcopter, often something like a DJI Mavic class of drone), and tells their FPV strike operator(s) to go after it

The spotter drone keeps track of the target, telling the FPV striker(s) where they are, if they are concealed and how etc - and once the strike(s) are done, they inspect the target for their status - whether they are WIA (""300"") or KIA (""200""). If they are just WIA, they may call for another strike on them, or determine that they will die and the resources (drones, operator time) is better spent on other targets",r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNzZaSEdISE9OQU9MUm4yVlVrMDM4OU9TYVJ2UVVfUE5ubV82NEZhM3RjZnNRZDFINS1rYVJza1lVNzFfczhob0tza3FRZm9fblpSYlg4by1tYWx3VFE9PQ==

"It is mostly difficult because of the lack of warning, and that it is difficult to know where to aim to attempt a lock-on, as they are so small and thin, having a small cross-section, so they're difficult to spot. They fly at near the speed of sound, so you get very little warning from audible cues, too. Ideally, they pass overhead, and you fire at them as they are flying away, so you don't have to move around trying to track it. 

But! The window for doing so is very short, as the heat-seeker missile you fire after it has a short range (although it is very fast, so it can catch up) - and the heat-seeker takes some time to acquire a lock, so you can't just fire immediately. So it's quite easy for the target to pass out of range before you can acquire a lock.

"One of our soldiers (Azerbaijani) once said that during the firefights sometimes he had doubts if he will make it out alive, then they would hear the sound of HAROP overhead.

Entire unit would feel an enormous relief and morale boost, being assured that they will live to fight another day. 

He said that HAROP has saved his life multiple times and he will always be grateful to Israel for giving us access to this technology. And that nobody in the world can ever make him switch sides on this. 

We were actually the first country in the world to use a kamikaze drone in combat in 2016 clashes. 

Before 2016, Armenians held majority of strategic heights and would shoot at our soldiers with impunity to demoralise them, killing dozens every year. 
Then HAROP was first used to help recapture some of those heights in 2016. It was such an enormous morale boost that it instantly became a household name. 

Some family even tried their newborn kid ‚ÄúHarop‚Äù, but ofcourse they weren‚Äôt allowed to.

In 2020 war, I heard from some of our soldiers that in some battles, Armenians literally fled and left their stuff behind, our army was just dumbfounded at the amount of materiel our boys captured. So it did have a psychological effect. 
But in some battles they held they did fight fiercely, we do actually give them credit for that when it is due.

What an insane world, a sound of fear for one is the sound of relief for another.",r/combatfootage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTE9WS3NzU0VUSXg2SWlTWHB3WnRkOU5sTVU2c1JaVkdiMjczRXZ6RlZ4eXVzd2VMOFczS0xqZHl3MzhjRU8xT2FpUmZzTzk3dE1faktRQWxZeVRQT2c9PQ==

">but the huge number of catastrophic explosions of russian tanks we see in Ukraine are the reality.

I get the feeling you didn't quite get the point of my previous reply.

The catastrophic detonation is because these vehicles are now facing weapons developed multiple decades later that circumvent their frontal armour protection. These vehicles (including western-built tanks) were developed with the expectation that they would receive fire front a frontal 60¬∞ arc. Instead they're largely being taken out by:

Mines, 155mm (guided) Artillery, Anti-tank weapons, Drones, in that order.

Almost all of which strike the vehicle from angles of attack other than the direct front. This is the same reason why Challenger 2/Strv 122/Leopard 2A4/Leopard 2A6 are being taken out relatively easily.

>The common russian soldier knows their faulty equipment. Thats why we see turtle tanks.

That makes no sense.

Western tanks are also receiving massive cages to cover their vehicles, does that mean the M1A1, Challenger 2 and Leopard 2A6 are *''faulty''*? The soldiers are adapting their equipment to face a threat none of these vehicles were designed to protect against.

>T-90 ... a tank that Putler thinks is the best of the world.

So what?

* Britain claims the Challenger 2 is the best tank in the world (Clarkson voice).
* Germany claims it's the Leopard 2.
* The US claims it's the M1A2.

Every country does it.

>Defeated by Bradleys....

Not sure what that is supposed to imply. Any tank is vulnerable to autocannons. The Bradley is equipped with weapons specifically to knock out tanks.

A BMP-2 firing 30mm AP will quickly knock a M1 out of action as well, both Soviets and Western countries have performed in-depth analysis on this and found that within a few seconds, vision devices, tracks, periscopes, basically everything on the exterior of a vehicle is destroyed.

Your question about deserving a country is complex. In order to give Kurds land, you would have to redraw borders of 4 countries. It's an impossible task. Plus its easy to say to another nation, ""Give them your land,"" when its not about your own country. 

And the opinion of ""deserve a country"" is not really an argument. One thing that comes to mind is the Roma people. There are a total of 8 to 15 million spread through the balkans.

"> Soldiers have to such right to kill, only to incapacitated, but if death happens during incapacitation,

I never saw this opinion before. Can you provide some source which supports it?



> ¬†Even if the Russian thought he was being shot by friendlies, it can very well stilm constitute as a surrender since there was no intent to attack after the first bullet.

I have the same opinion as expresed in this article. [https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/](https://lieber.westpoint.edu/legal-practical-challenges-surrender-drones/) 

>¬†For the obligation to attach, the enemy must unambiguously express a genuine intent to surrender (see U.S. DoD‚Äôs¬†[Law of War Manual](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/DoD%20Law%20of%20War%20Manual%20-%20June%202015%20Updated%20Dec%202016.pdf?ver=2016-12-13-172036-190), ¬ß [5.9.3.2](http://5.9.3.2);¬†[Oslo Manual](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/7065a5e9-c8a8-4cc7-a7f9-7f8f4fadd056/2020_Book_OsloManualOnSelectTopicsOfTheL.pdf), Rule 103(a)-(b)). While the precise manner of surrender may vary, the burden of demonstrating the requisite clarity rests on the surrendering party. Without a clear expression of genuine intent, belligerents are not obliged to presume the enemy has surrendered (see Commentary to Rule 103(b)).

I don't see an intent to surrender here. the russian soldier thought that he was shot by other russians, thus he tried to identify himself as a fellow russian. No one knows what would he do if he realise that he was encountered ukrainians, because he was killed before he could do anything.



> The conversation after only highlights the presumed malicious intent behind the soldier's action.

My opinion is: He had an intent to kill. He starts to shoot and shoots until he is shure that the enemy is dead.

"Weird timeline. 

The PPK were instrumental in the defeat of ISIS, As well as protecting Turkey from ISIL fighters who were fleeing back to the west via the northers borderlands.

But of course, Nationhood is often forged in conflict, and the Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world without a Nation. 

Not going to lie, I know several Kurds and I've met folks who have fought with the YPG, I hear nothing but good things about em.

"Looking at all the sparks in the air, I would assume that the drone hit the gunners' turret or the actual hatch. I was hit while serving in ukraine, and we had a similar situation. One of the gun ports(btr- 3e) was hit by a drone. Shrapnel didn't fly inside but the gun ports cover blew off. Had alot of smoke and sparks in cabin. It's was very similar to this video.

Edit: At the time it scared the shit out of me because right before we were hit I was complaining to my battlebuddy that there was a shit ton of oil on the base of the btr where we were sitting.

They literally did a multiple attacks last year???

Also they only stopped doing that because their bases got pushed back further.

Turkey isn't at war with Syria, it's mainly just skirmishes. If you talking about occupied lands its due to Syria incompetence at protecting their own border.

"Oh definitely none that it would have happened to would have survived, especially so if it were against a Russian tank as they are not really designed with survivability in mind.

However, if I were in a Russian tank or any tank, I would imagine if a bradley is firing on you, probably best not to point your barrel at him if you have no other choice. Likely better to back up and then line up a shot. I dunno, I'm not an expert though. You likely would have a hard time aiming anyways with 25mm shells landing against your hull and your optics.

"This is a very strange event. Two islamist organisations fighting over power. The seculars are losing who ever wins. In both cases they are screwed. 

Another funny thing is Erdoƒüan telling the Gulenists that he gave them access to what ever they want and asking what do they want even more. He basically confessed giving access to a terrorist organization to armies weaponry. Not some basic stuff. We are talking about F16's and Apache helicopters which are seen in this video. 

Yet he claimed that god should forgive him for this errors and maintained, even strengthened his position. The investigation to political connections to this event was rejected. The politicians who were openly supporting and giving aid to Gulenists did not get any impact. But many regular person who is paying his rent to his home owners account in Gulenist bank was prosecuted and relieved of their government jobs. Of course seculars as well.
