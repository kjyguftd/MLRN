"I’m no expert, man, but I would assume they can somehow monetize a portion of the outstanding obligation. They can transfer the guarantee to a financial institution, which then advances the money at a discount. Divisible SBLCs makes the process easier.

"Some similarities in the day to day, some differences as well. For one, both physical and paper traders follow the market and all related indexes closely - although with slightly different objectives. The physical trader will search for opportunities within the market in the form of gaps and inefficiencies. He will then determine if these inefficiencies have already been priced in before deciding to take a position. 

The paper trader examines the same market curves but uses technical analysis combined with his knowledge of current market situation to determine if certain indexes or spreads are over or under priced. This will help him to develop a trade.

Physical traders require a good knowledge of operations, since that's where money could be made or lost. Also many money making opportunities reside within the complexity of logistics. So yes, there will be an element of ops involved. 

People around here often say the best way to break into the industry is to become a scheduler, which is not wrong. But my personal take is: do whatever it takes to get your foot through the door and work your way from there.

Earning potential varies with different commods, across different firms. There are both paper and phys traders who net 8 figures yearly, everything boils down to how effective you are.

"Lol yes you will need to learn that map but it will take time. A good trader and manager will give you grace on that, at least mine did. I would think this answer varies widely, all pipes essentially schedule different and while the fundamental scheduling activities may be the same the economics of the pipe are different. Some have pools, some don't, some segmenting, some don't. There are also storage management, interconnect management, and cut management. For my pipeline, what helped me in the beginning was learning what my pipes scheduling priorities were and all my contracts paths. I have roughly 100 contracts and understanding their primary rec point and del points helped me understand how I can get gas to areas on my pipe. Also understanding the economics of the pipe will help. You should know all the rec points price action on your pipe. You don't necessarily need to know the daily price but at the minimum know which has the cheapest gas, where expensive gas is being sold and most importantly why.

Example: my pipe is in the east region. Gas is cheap on the west side of the pipeline and expensive on the east. That's because there's a bottleneck in the middle where two sections converge. One section is a 22"" pipe the other is a 20"" pipe, both converge into a 16"" pipe. Therefore there's a lower amount of gas that can make it thru. In the summer you can get secondary in path thru usually, secondary out of path will likely get cut. During peak days you can guarantee only primary is getting thru, maybe a small percentage of secondary in path makes it. Compressor stations at the interconnect on the west side can receive roughly 325k dth all the way thru to the choke point. That choke point can flow roughly 132-134k dth. So because less gas can make it thru, gas becomes more expensive east of that compressor station. To add another variable, there's not a lot of production east of that bottleneck further increasing price, and then lastly, the east side experiences much colder temperatures in the winter which can send prices thru the roof. Its not uncommon for me to see on a day in the winter were gas is selling for $5 on the west side and then $20 on the east side, and $35 in Transco Z5S.",r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZekx4OHQ3azhMNkIxU29KTERYOENCeFJxQ0lVdjRWUTJCcGVtc0tLVFNUR3FPajJ6WlZJa1MyU09TMWlUUlBMa1BZUDRfdEVEZW04a01yRklPaVR5b1E9PQ==

"Scheduling is ideal if you want to get to trader because to trade a pipe you need to understand how gas flows on and off the system. When scheduling, you master your pipeline and are the keeper of this knowledge. My trader scheduled my pipeline many years ago, if he jumped on it, he would be fairly lost therefore he relies on my forecasts and numbers to assist his trading strategy. I would say it is difficult to get into scheduling. There are zero degrees offered for it, and last I checked, there's no courses offered at any university in the United States dedicated to just scheduling. I would assume there may be some graduate programs that have a course which may cover scheduling activities in one lesson.

"Hi Grand - 

Depends on the utility and personality....such as EDF and Uniper imho are much more commercial and a bit more spec (which means higher pay but higher job volatility), the others I believe are going to be more straight buying for energy needs and sometimes selling.

For your career - if you start at a non-commercial utility, then you may be limited as pure trading houses may not see you as a creative thinker (shouldn't be the case - but I've seen this first hand).....

So, my simple advice is while you are young and mobile - start at trading houses and you will learn the ropes in a high stress/pressure - but then you're equipped to go anywhere....

"It has elements of both, obviously. Shipping side is a lot like oil, but off-take and sale you need to deal with the gas side. e.g. if you sell LNG into Europe you better know your stuff on TTF, NBP and EU gas markets. Same for the off-take side you need to be pretty fit in HH market and dynamics.
And actually, the shipping side is as well a bit peculiar: you have e.g. boil-off during voyage which is a big factor in trading optimization. On the other hand you have to deal less with quality or grade (which plays a big role for oil). So your gas is usually the same around the globe and you bring the LNG to where it‘s most profitable (Asia, SEA, EU, Latam). Destination side is mostly accessible with pretty liquid futures. So your difference (discount) of your physical LNG vs. your hedge is quite low. On oil you usually have to optimize for the right refineries who run that specific grade, etc. Some hedging can be done via NY futures, but the grade and quality differences are quite substantial, so you need to have a wider network for your shorts to make sure you can manage the risks.

So in way: different than both, or actually you need to master both worlds to excel at LNG.",r/commodities,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWE1mVFlsbHpaNENDN1dsbHprM2kxankzVXNVQ2g1ZGZhWlZtckZPa3VUeDhBRERhMUhLbjBTRkI3YlVVbUhnOU9MT3hXcUVXSWNzWG9RU0dUUHpkZHc9PQ==

"Fine, JKM you are right.

HH: when I was on one of the biggest LNG desks we had substantial analysis, data and exposure to HH.

So you are right once the LNG is on the ship it‘s decoupled from HH. But to get it there or not (i.e. execute your take-off option or not), has lots to do with HH.

"You don't have to answer here ...  but here is what traders look for when adding another trader:  

Do you spend your ""off time"" at end of day with traders if they work into the night offering assistance or just watching what they do?

Do you know the ""head of trading"" at the counter-parties you deal with?

Do you ever go to lunch or have a drink after work with the traders?

Have you offered a way to do business cheaper, earlier or more often with a counterparty from what you've seen as a scheduler?

Have you studied technical or fundamental analysis and the asked questions about those with your traders? 

Have you expressed an interest in getting a trading opportunity with your traders?

Have you noticed an odd cyclicality of price action on  among the schedulers you contact that might lead to your traders exploiting it.  

Do you send a bi weekly email to your traders about odd things you've noticed in the scheduling activity you perform?

To get into trading as a scheduler you have to make them think you are becoming a trader anyway and make them notice that outside of your job you are attempting to make money or solve problems they have.  That's what I observed over  40 years.   That's how I got into trading: solved a HUGE problem before scheduling day that the traders couldn't solve.  I would go over to the trade room after my 9-5 ""lease crude buying"" and watch them at work globally.  Soon they accepted me as a scheduling assistant then one day I got a chance to help.
