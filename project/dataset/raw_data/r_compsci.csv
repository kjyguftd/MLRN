"I went in cold but my Dutch uni/college (bachelors)was designed for that. Despite this, less than 40% makes the first year. Of the 40%, 90% passes without having to redo a year. 
Even students with experience (associates degree or some kind of programming courses prior to their major) fell off very often during group projects. To me it's more about drive and interest than experience. I feel like a lot of students just want to get some kind of IT/SE job (I know it's not cs, but in a similar ballpark) because of the salaries. That's not the proper motivation to make it through this kind of major. If you're passionate about how those black magic fuckery machines we call pcs work and want to be able to have ideas and realise them through computing, then you're in the right mindset.

For me that passion came from videogames and pirating them. To me PCs are basically able to do anything, you the user just needs to be able to tell it what to do. Keep in kind that's just a general interest towards computers. I just knew I wanted some job related to them. I didn't even know what an integer was before I started, but I just knew once I understood the foundations that the sky is the limit.

During college I would often learn concepts on my own which would then be introduced in a class a few days later, because I feel like a good way to learn is to try and solve problems. While learning software architecture with cpp (my minor) I applied idioms my teachers wouldn't even have told me about, but when I explained them they were very interested as to how I discovered it. I told them I ran into a problem and this seemed like a fitting solution after some research. The teacher essentially told me 'thats the spirit'. 

If I had some prior knowledge I feel like it'd have helped a lot. A lot of 'ooohh I get it now' moments would've occured earlier making certain classes easier to grasp. It'd have allowed me to focus more on fully grasping more complex concepts introduced to me there instead of just trying to make something work for a deadline.

"This is a fair question.  i have been programming for over 4 decades, and it is my opinion that the world doesn't actually have any *programming languages* yet, all we have so far is just *coding languages*.  
  
So what do i mean by this?  
  
Well none of the PLs allow the programmer to follow the coastline of the problem domain they wish to solve;  
instead, they have to **translate** *from* the problem domain *into* some arbitrary contrived and uniquely peculiar solution domain of some particular coding language.  
And because we ONLY have just *coding languages*, there are now over 100,000 distinct PLs, all distinct, none of them compatible with each other.

  
Let me draw the contrast between *coding languages*, and what would represent a *programming language*:

  
A *coding language* is a formally defined set of rules for a contrived grammar, concerning: syntax, symbols, and lexical scoping ‚Äì to equip a software coder to ‚Äò‚Äòencode‚Äô‚Äô a set of instructions for a computational device.¬† To ‚Äúcode‚Äù really means to translate or convert; in this case to convert from the problem domain to the solution domain.¬† This conversion is necessary since coding languages always have idiosyncratic notational systems, which are their own solution space.¬†

Defining characteristics of *coding languages* are: inflexible syntax, immutable reserved keywords, and arbitrary restrictions concerning: symbol composition, operator types, and operator set extensibility.¬† A coding language is a synthetic constrained subset of a *programming language*.¬†

  
A *programming language* on the other hand, virtually eliminates any need for encoding or translating; since it is the specification of a formal ‚Äò‚Äòpseudocode‚Äô‚Äô to enable direct linguistic expression of algorithms and mathematical expressions, with the aim of being understood and executed by a computer.

Distinguishing features of a *programming language* would be: flexible syntax, mutable reserved keywords, and zero restrictions ‚Äì every aspect would be open to modification, and any linguistic expression or notational system could be natively supported.¬† A programming language enables a computer to be a *pseudocode* executing engine.  


*Pseudocode* itself is a formal expression of algorithms stated in an informal approximation of a natural language; it is the lingua franca between programmers.¬† Whenever the solution to a programming problem is expressed in pseudocode, then coders skilled in *Java* or *Lisp*, in *Python* or *Fortran*, ‚Ä¶ etc., all readily understand it, without needing to know each other's specialized coding system.

  
This being the case, then why even have *coding languages* in the first place?¬† Why need a skillset to translate from formal pseudocode to some particular computer code?¬† Instead of *coding*, why not simply do *programming* ‚Äì **directly**, in an actual *programming language*, and let the computer execute the resultant software?

If we actually had a true programming language, we would have no need for any other!¬† Programmers would no longer waste time and effort to become proficient in some particular coding language variant.¬† Instead of *coding*, programmers would be doing what they do best; which is *programming*.¬†

*Programming* would now mean: gathering specifications & requirements, researching & consulting, analyzing problems, working out solutions, selecting the most viable, and then implementing by expressing them in algorithmic terms (formal pseudocode) as a software program*.*

¬†A *software program* would be a set of instructions, expressed in formal pseudocode, to be executed by a computer.

*Programmers* would now be a guild of algorithmic craftsmen; they would be professionals and artisans rather than proletariat ‚Äò‚Äòcoders‚Äô‚Äô.¬† They would no longer be a priesthood of tech scribes essentially paid to be literate in translating into a particular coding scheme.

"I am a retired programmer. After 45 years of programming, my experience has taught me to *NEVER* use a ~~IDE~~. A good editor *YES*, an ~~IDE~~ *NO!* On Windows machines I have always used ***Notepad++***. Sadly, Linux does not have a feature rich editor like ***Notepad++***.

For Linux I regularly use ***Bluefish*** or KDE's ***Kate*** editor - ***Kate*** being preferred over ***Bluefish***. There are two primary functions I use on an editor. ***""Block""*** or ***""column""*** cut & paste, and some type of ***""snippet""*** manager. To me, the rest is fluff. Context and bracket ***highlighting*** and advanced ***search and replace*** are quite important time savers too.

The main disadvantage of ***Kate*** is it does not have an intuitive spelling checker (you have to select it from the menu) or code block comment toggle (there is no undo, so no toggle). Other than this, it is quite good.

***Bluefish*** main fault is it lacks a intuitive snippet manager. Other than this, it is also quite good.

By regularly programming with a good editor you will be able to walk up to any persons computer and solve problems. If you rely on an ~~IDE~~ you will find it difficult to trouble shoot or assist other people in many situations.

Of course we are all different and others may have different experiences.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloot_Digital_Coding_System states that this sort of encoding would violate basic data compression principles such as Shannon's source coding theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%27s_source_coding_theorem)

Reading the rest of the article and assuming Sloot actually had something, I think Sloot's system was something similar to ""hashing"", the same thing bittorrent uses. Hash collisions (two different files having the same hash) does occur, but is rare, even in shorter hashes such as sha512 (64 bytes). With a well-chosen 8000-byte hash, and even allowing for the birthday paradox, you could easily assign a ""probably unique"" number to each file.

I will check the code you've written as well, but Sloot seems to be saying ""if two computers have the same file, you only need to transfer a small amount of information to retrieve the file on the 2nd computer"". Since we can now search millions of computers for that one file (bittorrent), this almost makes sense: if a file has been created and someone has it and is willing to share it, you can almost certainly find it just by its hash",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbU9paVNEaXBaUzVXUjhuZ3kzcjNBZWpsUnZ5Y1NPeUQ4OGptVTlaRFRlYjVOc1Q2MkhCTkQxTU16UWF5ME03ZE1UbVd2eEl5NzFHMUtNcENVRy1Qcnc9PQ==

"Took a bit to understand but I think I have a grasp of the nonsense.

  
Step 1 create a dictionary based on repetition of the original. That is fine, that is a foundation for huffman coding and well understood in compression.

  
Step 2 create a dictionary of dictionaries. This right here is where it goes from rational to completely irrational. For a reference in the original post, this step begins at ""Secondly, the entire storage industry in it did not study and improve data storage systems so that there would be no duplicate data (8 bits -16 bits) -¬†"". The dictionary of dictionaries cannot be smaller than the smallest form of the first dictionary, proof of this is trivial. The claim though is that this results in significant compression of the data.

"From glancing at the patent, it seems an encoding where the encoder itself has all possible patterns (e.g. of 4 x 4 pixels) and the encoded file only has the key to this pattern. 

This is similar to e.g. gif files where you have a palette of colors, and the picture itself is encoded by referencing the index/key in the palette. (Though the palette does not contain all possible colours but only those used, and it's incorporated in the file).

On the other hand, *lossy compression* like jpeg divides the image into blocks and searches for the *function* (or rather the parameters for some function) that best match the area to be encoded, and stores those values. 

It seems that the OP claims a jpeg/gif hybrid where *all possible (?)* patterns are stored (but not *in* the compressed file) and the file has the keys to those patterns. 

But gif already doesn't store all possible colours but only those used. And jpeg doesn't find exact matches. There are to many possible patterns of e.g. 16 x 16 full color pixels. But if you only for used patterns, then you can only lossless encode pictures that are known. And all this knowledge is in the encoder program. So you'll have a *huge* encoder, in order to have huge compression on the files you want to compres. It's like saying that I can compress a gigantic library of books because I can just tell you the ISBN (or title & author) of all books. For telling me which books to read, this is useful. But if I have to get the contents, I would have to decode the ISBN to the book and the book has to be part of the knowledge/memory of the encoder.",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZaWoxaE1BQS1VSU5nRVRsMVJzN1NzME9ncTBQODlxaXZsSGxWZE1ub2FheGR4RUZ3MHNHU3FsMWRjWVU1ODZVSGY5MFpMNmhaYTBySnFna1FzWEF5SXc9PQ==

"The code that loads a program and sets up process memory isn't a process itself, but a piece of code in the OS kernel. It's basically the execve() system call code.

The specifics are far too much for a Reddit post, but there are a lot resources out there. Basically the on-disk format says how many segments there are, what goes in what segment (how they are initialized if they are), and some info on where it should be placed in memory. The common format these days in Linux and Unix-like systems is ELF, and in Windows it's PE. Old-style (1970s and part of the 1980s) systems had basically two segments in the executable -- code and data - and then information about sizing of the other main ones (heap and stack). These days an executable file can have dozens of segments defined, and then more get set up and loaded from dynamically loaded libraries. Libraries generally don't get loaded by the OS kernel though - that's set up by user-level code (in Linux it builds on the mmap() system call).

">Is this concept specific to implementation of a programming language? In this case C.

Yes. The C compiler is allowed to do whatever it wants in the background as long as it conforms to the logical requirements of the C language specification. Trying to access memory out-of-bounds is undefined behavior, the compiler is not required to guarantee what will happen when you do that. (In fact, even accessing allocated memory byte-by-byte is undefined behavior; the language specification doesn't guarantee little-endian or big-endian byte order, and the compiler is free to use a mixture of both if it wants to.)

Programmers learned useful conventions for managing memory, and as high-level languages started to appear, they wrote compilers to automate the conventions that were already known to work well for efficiency and performance.",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaUk5MbXZGek5yLWdUaWFtOUtEaHJnRHVLNDBXT0ZWVlV5U2ZmaUF2aGIwTHRzaWtIXzNqdUZrZ2pUUDRScVAzR3BFc0VONHk3RWtLZWliWHRCYVdLd0E9PQ==

">every process has this memory layout

It depends on what you mean by ""this memory layout"".  There's a lot of variation depending on how you interpret what's fixed and what is generalisable about that image: for a start, very few systems have just 16Kb of address space these days.

Do you mean just the *existence* of code, stack and heap?  That they're single contiguous blocks? The relative positions? The direction they grow?  Only really the first is consistent - these aren't necessarily contiguous in memory, nor is the program code necessarily *before* the heap rather than after (or even interleaved).  Likewise, there are architectures when the stack grows down instead of up. 

There's also potentially a lot of other complications not really described there.  eg. there's often multiple stacks (for different threads), library code may be loaded at different addresses, and you may also have mmapped files.",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOTBpMjlPWHE3aXlnelNwMS1VOFZhanROMzR0Sk5hSTJDSUh6akVERG9BVm5NVFZTam5nSkR1RFppb08tcmMxenN4VVg0UlBZeFJ3TjBTTlNUVEhyZlE9PQ==

"> the problems that this kind of layout solved?

The core issue is that you have two growing memory segments: the stack and the heap. Some program memory is constant (the .text segment where instructions are stored, global and static variables), but every time a function is called you add another stack frame, and every time some code allocates memory dynamically outside the stack you need to put it somewhere else (the heap).

If those two memory sections collide then allocating new stack frames will get very complicated. Putting the stack and heap as far away as possible, and having them grow in opposite directions, ensures you will not encounter this problem until the program is out of memory anyway.",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSHk3ckJJSFJEa24weHBuS0U5cEJ0dnRfMlhlZDk3UnBqMEMtSm80U0JGMWFTTng1UXUwamxTc2NqTDRhYm5KYmhHNk9kSDY2SzE5Sjgta1ZqRm5aZkE9PQ==
"As far as I know, the different segments (heap, stack, text, data) are still there. When it comes to contiguous or not, it depends on the actual memory management approach.

"That layout is not mandated or required by C. It's just an easy layout for many OSes, especially if the OS supports virtual memory.


To illustrate an alternative, look at the 68000 based Amiga. The OS used supported preemptive multitasking, but did not support virtual memory. So, upon a new program being loaded, memory was searched for a free area large enough to fix the program to be loaded. The executable was then modified to execute in that selected location. Then the memory was searched for a free area large enough for the stack, and the stack pointer was initialized to it. Then the program was given control. If the program wanted to get something from the heap, it would make an OS call to find an unallocated area large enough to satisfy the request. So, at any given moment, you could have multiple programs located anywhere with memory, all with their internal address references modified to suit their locations within memory. And heap allocations in turn were scattered throughout memory.


Of course, since there was no virtual memory, any process could corrupt the memory being used by another process and hence crash the computer. But if the processes were well behaved, it was an extremely usable system.


As for the layout specified in your question, let's assume that the processor has a dedicated stack pointer the grows downward when new values are pushed onto the stack. With that behavior, the best place for the stack pointer to be initialized when empty is the top of available free memory. Putting it there gives the greatest possible freedom, without setting an arbitrary limit. Niw, where should the program executable itself be located? Obviously, placing it at the beginning of free memory gives the largest possible free space to the stack. So, the program is placed at the bottom of free memory.
But, many programs have variables that are not on the stack. An example would be the current seed for rand(), and the like such as static variables used by various linked library functions. A good place for those is immediately after the program executable. Hence the hashed section from 2KB to 4KB in your example. Once again, putting it there maximizes the free space available for stack growth. So, we now have three areas in use.


1. Program code. Bottom of free memory.


2. Static variables. Immediately after program code.


3. Stack. End of free memory.


The above arrangement maximizes the free space available for the stack. Now, we have the heap, which size cannot be predicted or calculated at load time. Where should we put it? Remember, we want the largest available free space for stack growth. Additionally, we would like to be able to grow the heap as much as possible, without interfering with the stack. Given that criteria, the obvious starting location is immediately after the static variables, growing upwards. And hence, we've duplicated the layout in your question. That layout gives the most flexibility in stack and/or heap growth.


Now, of course, there are other layouts that are possible that will still allow for maximum stack and heap growth. One thing that comes to mind is have the program and static variables relocated to the top of free memory and set the stack pointer immediately below the program. Bur doing so doesn't give any more memory for the stack and heap, plus it's more complicated to implement. So, it's not worth bothering.",r/compsci,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOFEyYThSeFFZZi00MjB6R2E0UG5tZ2QxS3V5T1I5RVhNODUxbkp6REpnWjNyM3Vid1F5cXRHSEltQXBJMmJKSDFyVHlBSUxHN194VTJCWUpoVGhITUE9PQ==
"And why wouldn't the samples be time ordered? Assuming 100 entries, all that needs to be maintained is a base index, combined with liberal use of modulus.


To add a new value:


base = (base+1) % 100; array[base]=value;



most recent value is always array[base]


oldest value is array[(base-99)%100]


Now, of course, the samples in the array are not strictly time ordered. But if you also reference from base+offset modulo array size, you'll get the values in time ordered sequence. Only recommendation is to increase the array from 100 to 128, so that the relatively expensive modulo operation can be replaced with a simple bitwise and operation.

"I've been a math maven since I was a kid, and do calculus (though not *lambda* calculus!) for fun in my spare time.  I've had most of the math of an Electrical Engineering degree, *plus* all the math of a CS degree, *plus* a lot of math acquired in practice, on-the-job, working 27+ years as a software engineer for Fortune 500 companies and a world-class scientific research facility.  I play with, and explore, math for fun and have discovered a few things that I haven't even seen written up anywhere online.  I first ran into lambda calculus in the course of attempting a Master's degree from about age 44 to about age 50-something, roughly 2007-2015; the basic concept of applying functions to ""things,"" some of which may, themselves, be functions, is crystal clear, but between the notation (which I find ambiguous), the ""explanations"" (loosely so-called), and the problem sets handed out, graded, and subsequently discussed, during that Master's work, the nice tidy concept immediately devolved into a whole lot of incomprehensible gobbledygook.  How ""this"" thing on paper represents ""that"" thing in conceptual thoughtspace, so to speak, is completely opaque despite numerous attempts by me to gain clarity from various sources, including my professor at the time and various books, webpages, and tools, since.  
  
I can do it, semi-sorta, when something like it is implemented in concrete form in a  functional *programming language* such as OCaml, Haskell, maybe even a smidgen of F#, but even that doesn't shed any useful light on the official ""lambda notation.""  I simply absolutely cannot work any problems (I don't even remember what the goal is supposed to be, aside from a vague recollection that the word, ""reduction"" may be involved at some point) expressed in that format; it is absolutely unclear what the ""first step"" might be, let alone any ""next step"" thereafter.  It may be relevant that I was never able to make any sense of the LISP programming language, either, back in my Bachelor's degree program in the mid-1980s.  With lambda calculus, I suddenly start to understand what my seventh-grade and high-school peers may have felt, looking at the algebra, later calculus, problems that were dead-easy and intuitively obvious *to me*.  
  
This isn't the first time I've been stuck on something that ""everybody else understood.""  I remember struggling mightily with C pointer syntax for months, in the early 1990s, before eventually ""getting it.""  Same with most of the rudiments of Perl a decade later.  It seems to be mainly a matter of the standard explanations of things not matching the way my brain operates: ordinary people giving the ordinary explanations hit me as nonsense and gibberish.  I know one single person who's always been able to make sense of things like this for me -- he unjammed me on the Perl thing in a single afternoon, after nearly six-months of solo banging-my-head-against-the-wall -- but he can only explain things he himself already knows, and I don't know if he knows Lambda Calculus.

"There is no question that ATSs are the scourge of the jobhunting world.  Even the companies that use them openly admit they frequently weed out very good would-be candidates, but they have no choice but to use them anyway and not always seeing the best applicants is just a cost of doing business.

They are also somewhat of a black box so all you can do is the best you can.

I suggest tailoring every resume individually for the job being offered, and make sure all important words in the JD are also in your resume, with the most important ones appearing more than once.  (Of course, only if your background actually supports it--you can't claim skills you don't have just to make the ATS happy!)

Also, there are some apps and websites out there which claim to take your resume, compare it to a JD which you provide, and give you a ""score"" similar to what an ATS might do, and show you the ways you could improve your resume to score higher.  These sites aren't always completely reliable or accurate, but they do highlight interesting findings which at least will make you think about your resume in a different (and more helpful) way.

Make sure nothing about your style, font, template, or heading names is too unusual and might ""trick"" the ATS into thinking you are not a good match when you actually are.

Finally, make sure you are following every well-established best practice in all other ways *besides* how you address ATSs.  ATSs rule all in some ways, but no matter how ATS-savvy you are, it can't overcome a bad application overall or get you an interview when you are really not a good fit.
