"The suggestion seems to be based on the assumption that the malicious files contains the file name of the created file in clear text.  If it does, a simple search should find it.

However, good malware does not do that.  If it needs a specific file name, it would either decoded or decrypted at run time, or constructed at run time.  The only way to catch those (? I think) would be to monitor OpenFile system calls with creation options turned on (and any related calls that can be used for the same purpose) for cases where the specified file name matches the one you are looking for.

At this point, and after running a few tests on my end on other extractions that I have, I'm having him try doing an export with the option to redact all images checked, hoping that cellebrite doesn't ""look"" at the images, but just creates placeholders for them in the report.

"A few ideas:

1. If this is related to your security implementation, the first thing to try would be to run the same test acquisition outside of the environment. If it succeeds, you have your answer and you can talk to IT further to get to the bottom of the issue.

2. If your test accounts are on Google Workspace, it is possible to disable the use of Drive API there. We can walk you through where to look in Google Workspace Admin.

3. With the new Google Granular Consent, it is possible to give an app partial consent. So, you may be inadvertently not authorizing the Drive scope that is needed for the collection. Recent versions of FEC support Granular Consent and detect such a scenario automatically.

If you are working with test accounts, feel free to reach out to our support and provide a limited token. We can run a test acquisition and report back 👍🏻",r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc2xwTmdkbk1sMWNmeVZ0SEs3d016Q29fTXFfV0UwaC0xeV85UEpCVE1Wc0pidzh0clN4VWgzX09GU2o3cF9mMExBNFFNc0xLR283YU04VncwUzJkLUE9PQ==

I deleted a text message thread from my phone that I really need to recover.  I use a Moto G Stylus 5G phone with Boost Mobile as the carrier.  The default app for texting is Google Messages and I have never previously backed up anything to Google One or any cloud based backup program.  I know that Google says that once they are gone, they are gone, and there's no recycle bin or trash, but is there any way to recover them forensically?  I have called Boost, they can only give me call and text metadata, but not the texts themselves, and I have tried to contact Google with very limited, unhelpful results.

"You can use any type of experience in digital forensics You just need to know how to adapt those into the field. When I was younger applying for jobs I would say I have X background and I can apply that and give you a different perspective that would help you and your company. 

You have to learn how to sell yourself. Being unique or having a different background could be good but you have to show the company how it applies to them. For example you could say if we get a e-discovery case or you want to expand and to eDiscovery I would be able to help.

"In order to answer that let's look at it from the standpoint of the person you want hiring you.

Say you personally are charged with a crime and the data on your PC, cloud, and phone can all prove your innocence.  

Your attorney hasn't had to use a computer forensic person before, so they google computer forensic examiner and call them.   They also find your company listed as a company who does computer forensic work.

When you are interviewing the 2 parties so you can retain them on your case, what would you want to hear from them in order to believe they can not only handle your case, but also have a really good shot at winning your case?

"For Computer Forensics (at least, what I mean by the term), you need to get closer to the software and hardware.

Those parts that can done by searching documents and their metadata, you already know. But you (probably) also need to get security architecture under control, so you can answer if user U could have access to file F, directory D, registry content R and so on for all controlled entities (I'm thinking Windows; translate as required for other platforms) at time T (or in some period of time). Access control is not well covered by any of the usual books or cert training I've seen, and forensic tools tend to bypass it altogether. (Things change, though, and might have done so recently.)

As well as other things, often related to malware (and non-malware identified as malware by overeager anti-malware products), and not infrequently related to imaging and data recovery.  CF is also (I believe) more divided into expert fields: a Windows analyst is not usually useful for other platforms.

The purpose of computer forensics is to answer additional questions than those eDiscovery addresses. 

For Windows, I'd suggest something like a sysadmin cert from Microsoft, possibly with security engineering added to it. (Those existed several years ago -- a quick glance through Microsoft's certification does not identify anything obvious, unless it all is subsumed into Microsoft 365.)  This will help you understand corporate IT environments, where things are not the same as in personal systems.  As always, time spent in sysadmin roles and such are probably more worth than any forensic cert.",r/computerforensics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbFhNbmk0VE1PR1pfLVczR0t0ZUtHX01ILVpmcHVDVnh5bUNHRDJkdVN4VG5TWXRaeXlpQ193bERIbFBMVy1HQXBXMFZEQzJDbUFWRkZJaUpBU0xGYXc9PQ==

"Im going on 6-7 years in dfir and to be honest it is hard to get 'real' experience in the area without living through an incident. The biggest thing I have noticed when it comes to the work is the fact that you just need to be versed across everything because you never know what your going to be given. My route to dfir was helpdesk for a number of years whilst studying cyber sec and then applying for a dfir job. I got the job because of my years of experience working in helpdesk so my boss assumed (in which he was correct) that I would have a very good understanding of what an endpoint should look like so when I get something thats off I can see it / pick it up straight away. This has worked for me thus far. 

  
CTF's would be the next best thing and I love doing them, but they are generally far from the 'real' day to day stuff. So if anything, I would say make sure you stay versed across all systems and get good and identifying what is normal so that you can show quickly what is not normal.
