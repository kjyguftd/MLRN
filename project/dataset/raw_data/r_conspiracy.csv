"The Golden Arches logo of McDonald's represent the gates to Heaven and to Hell. The yellow represents obviously greed (the colour of gold), but also dishonesty. And notice anything particular about their jingle ""I'm lovin it""? Not only is it a double entendre, but there's something important missing: the G!. That's because they want to make a world without God, where we are unhealthy and poor while they live in debauchery. 

See how easy it is to make up BS? 

And speaking of missing letters: naw-shaw does mean to deceive, but as far as I know, there is no National Aeronautics and Space Hovercraft Administration. It's NASA, not NASHA, and the word naw-saw in Hebrew means ""to lift up"" or ""to carry"". 

Most importantly, you're missing the forest for the trees. If you're right, NASA probably spends hundreds of millions of dollars, use threats, blackmail, and murder to cover up their real objectives.

"An ancient civilization created human beings. This ancient civilization was extremely human-like and lived and died on earth to the point that some cultures (like the Bible) remembered them as ""patriarchs"" of humanity and as the ""first humans"" themselves.

But this allowed these so-called ""deities"" or ""patriarchs"" to live for centuries or even millennia. 

Perfection in terms of a being who’s immortal, doesn’t age and is perfect from both a mental and physical standpoint doesn’t exist unfortunately – but what the so-called ""Adam and Eve"" couple lost when they were kicked out of Eden is on the other hand the ability that God granted to his ""children"" (i.e. to the members of this ancient civilization since the so-called ""God of the Sky"" was their chief) – and that ability was the one to have access to these rejuvenating processes that would allow for these beings to keep prolonging their lifespans and rejuvenate their bodies.

"If I had a large cavity on a back tooth that wasn't big enough to need a crown, I would probably request amalgam. It's stronger, more resistant to getting future cavities, and isn't as finicky in wet environments when you work with it. There is risk with mercury, but these risks are highest when you are placing the filling or when you are removing. Once it hardens, the mercury essentially becomes trapped in the filling. Mercury *may* leach from the filling over time in the mouth, but is considered a very minimal amount in the research I've seen. They can conduct temperature a bit more than composite fillings and really big amalgams have the risk of fracturing down the line. This said, working in dentistry, you'll tend to see a lot of older folks with metal fillings they got when they've had for a very long time that are still holding up. You rarely see composite fillings last this long. Now all this said, a lot of research goes into improving composite materials and they really are improving with time so there might be a product that fully replaces amalgam in the next decade or so. There's a material called glass ionomer that could be great for this purpose, but at this time they're still a bit too weak to utilize in a lot of situations.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVnJuLTBMTWxNQk8td0F1S2NBY0dENVVzQ2FQNUg0UHZHekdVZXI2TXBhUE9JTGtyZDZpdHUzdjVSTG9wUFIxR005b3BXUUFuS3F3dnBxREp5clBLMkE9PQ==

">I just explained to you why its not put forward in congress. Not why the current system can't properly convey the will of the people.

Well, if it's not put forward, it's not going to pass through. Or do you suggest that no one actually wants any improvement? Ask any person, what do you expect the answer would be?

>The will of the people is not to change the system. Any attempt to would get shot down

So, people are, what, content sheep? Is that your suggestion? I don't understand your worldview.

>They count because when you cast your vote, it determines the outcome. Not in China, China is a 1 party system for example with sham elections. The US has real elections.

Well, maybe you can affect abortions. But not all the wars and corporate corruption. Not the important stuff. Can you? If you can, who should you vote for then? Again, certainly not for the Democrats.

>China is just less oppressed by its leaders than north korea, but its leaders are equally set in stone. Americas leaders are chosen by the peoples votes.

If Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden represent the will of the people, something is wrong with either the people or the electoral process. I guess you choose the former. In which case, why defend democracy at all, it seems to be terrible.

"That's false. What is true is that a steel framed building that large had never collapsed before, but that hardly proves that it's impossible.



Steel is actually very susceptible to fires and loses most of it's strength at temperatures which are easily attainable in an office fire. That's exactly why we use fireproofing, sprinkler systems, standpipe systems and other fire safety measures. What made this different from typical office fires is the fact that the fires were widespread over multiple floors, that the sprinkler system was rendered inoperable due to a severed water main and that there was no attempt by the fire department to extinguish the fire. You will find few if any comparable situations where a high rise building was simply left to burn with so many fires. Most office fires are quickly extinguished either by sprinkler systems or by the fire department before it grows out of control. That's why it's so rare.

  
But if you don't believe me, you can also read about the high rise building in Iran which also collapsed from fires alone. Not as tall, but it demonstrates the point.

"I am not saying that it makes sense, and making a plane fly into the pentagon is a very exaggerating way to get rid of evidence indeed. But there are several little facts people collect and then try to make a story of it. For example something about the WTC being insured for billions just literal days before the attacks, because the owners has other plans for the WTC grounds (very hard to confirm by ordinary people so they believe this), and boom, makes absolute sense to sacrifice 3000+ people just to get the money and be able to build something new there.

If you believe in a deep state (with lots of genius people involved who are able to keep their mouths shut for decades), then this is a perfect story for a false flag.

"Doubtful it's incompetence. 

This is the new methodology of our country. The SS is controlled by the federal government....not Trump. Therefore, controlled by the DNC. 

Consider RFK jr. 

The DNC is DENYING SS for RFK jr eventhough he is the third most popular candidate garnering 9% up to 20% of the polling. It is unprecdented that a candidate would be denied protection by the Feds. When you add that his father and his uncle were assassinated while in political service to this nation, its not only unprecedented.....it's downright sinister. That's what I mean by the new methodology of our country. No bottom line. 

The elite group that wants Democrats to win realizes there is no hope given Bidens cognitive demise. They got the SS to be lax to open up an avenue to take out Trump. Their abuses of power of government agencies of Lawfare and unprecedented criminal conviction of a former President and candidate hasn't stopped Trump. Maybe violence can (I'm definitely NOT saying the shooter is their operative.... what I'm saying is that it's abundantly clear the SS did NOT do their job here and I showed that this is perhaps not a fuck up but a methodology to eliminate the competition....just like RFK jr and just like Lawfare). 

ALTERNATIVE IDEA.... but much less likely than above:

After this event, Trump has become a hero. For someone of his age to get hit in an assassination attempt and then stand up and pump his fists yelling FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT is now going elevate him to a DEMAGOGUE. He will now become the first DEMAGOGUE President and that will lead to a total shit show in this nation of lemmings that will go along with whatever he says. So there is an incentive for the elite/CIA etc... to have this theater.... they want a demagogue that will bring in total obedience from the people. But it's so difficult to pull off this theater on live TV that I'm doubtful about this alternative idea. 

But the prior concept of the SS purposefully being lax is way more likely than ""incompetence"".

"There is apparently very little info about the guy, and it conflicts in terms of politics (they are saying Repub registration and also a progressive pac donation).  So far very few photos, no social media.  There was an initial report that he had no ID on him.

The lack of personal photos and background info sounds familiar to a certain shooter of a Hooky school a while back, just saying.  And some other shooters.  Weird in this day and age not to have more info on someone.  How many young people these days have zero social media apparently and little footprint.

I'm also worried that the Secret Service and security in general failed to spot a guy perched on a low roof not far from the podium.  In a flat open area without tall buildings.  Where a couple witnesses said they saw him with a rifle and climbing up and tried telling police.  Then took him out in seconds. 

Anyone remember from Reddit a while back when there was info that the FBI was basically entrapping/enticing mentally ill people to be dangerous extremists, to boost their own numbers of solved cases.

Pro Wrestlers are not unknown to use blood packets or even razors to make small but dramatic looking injuries that often bleed but not too much.

His hand goes right to his ear before he goes to the floor and the blood is coming from the top of the ear where if one were to his a packet would be a perfect place.

Also notice the lack of continued blood running, yeah a little streak on his face but after that? No drips not even on his shirt. Almost like there was a set amount then nothing.

Also for  grazed ear it’s amazingly intact, no ragged edges or even change to the shape of the ear at the impact site. Miraculous.

"Here's my two cents.

Before any kind of event where a security detail is required, there is a degree of planning that should take place. Part of that is a recce of the area beforehand. Likely firing points, blind spots, dead ground etc should all be identified. Likely firing points are then given a reference. This is to aid in target indication. Rather than stating 'shooter 150m to the north, grey building, rooftop' etc etc, you can just simply state whatever name is allocated to that firing point. Anyone who is in the security detail will have had the same brief and immediately know where to look. Best practice is to actually occupy the firing point. Not only does it deny any potential shooter access to that spot, it also allows for a good vantage point to monitor the crowd. 

Less than 150 metres away, it's very strange that rooftop wasn't occupied. My guess is that due to the rural location, and it being a pro Trump area, SS did not see this one as a high threat environment. I don't know much about the shooter, but I'd bet he wasn't from the local area. Anyone in the local area with strong political views (especially a criminal record) would be treated as a threat and their picture would have been shared amongst the security detail. Add in the fact an eye witness was trying to raise the alarm before the engagement started, then it gets very strange. Local law enforcement and the SS detail should have immediately been on comms with each other to at least be aware of the fact there was a commotion at (what should have been a pre determined) firing point. The reaction of the detail who moved to shield Trump is genuine. I personally think this is a case of they took this event too lightly and didn't act as quickly as they should have. I don't think there was some attempt to allow Trump to be killed.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3Y3MFhpblBjMFNnVzA0c2h5aGJpM3hRQVlIVlBjR2xvY2dlMWlyamJzMXFKeDc0X2xjdUlSdmFldk1nWU9zS1VDcmM0MjNuckJ4eUdMZWdqRWRaU2c9PQ==

There is some really angry ones tho like Tom Steyer was going completely crazy about Trump in the last election there seemed to be pure hatred. Even worse than De Niro or Stephen King for who you could argue its more a social media play (tho even they might have some hate).
  
But yeah, this Tom Steyer was going completely crazy. So could he plan something like this, pay someone? Probably.

"The AR-15 with a scope is generally considered more accurate than the 6.5 mm Carcano rifle with a scope. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Design and Manufacturing**: The AR-15 is a modern rifle with advanced manufacturing techniques and materials, which typically result in higher precision and consistency in performance.

2. **Ammunition**: The AR-15 usually fires 5.56 NATO or .223 Remington cartridges, which are known for their accuracy and consistent ballistics. The 6.5 mm Carcano cartridge, used in an older military rifle, often has more variation in performance due to its age and less refined production.

3. **Ergonomics and Customization**: The AR-15 platform is highly customizable, allowing for better ergonomics, improved trigger systems, and more stable shooting platforms, all of which contribute to better accuracy. 

4. **Scope Mounting**: Modern AR-15 rifles have more robust and precise scope mounting systems, which help maintain zero and improve accuracy over time. The Carcano’s older design might not provide as secure a mount for optics.

While the Carcano can be accurate, especially with proper maintenance and good quality ammunition, the AR-15’s modern design and engineering generally give it an edge in accuracy.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTS1NUjRvdVNQbU9ORUp4T2xicEhaVHc3ZlB1NFZSQ3VmQXgzcWJZNF95bkhTdmhGQkt3UlJhT1lkRHJQdGNzU0E0bE9QM2RiRVU5cjFnYVl0eXljbVE9PQ==

"I look to conspiracies when there's no obvious reason for things to happen or it doesn't make sense. JFK was generally loved by the public. Wasn't perfect by any means but when he was killed it was a real WTF moment for everyone. With Trump I think the reaction of the general public was more like ""this is bad but I kinda get it."" 

Legacy media adores Trump. He's the biggest cash cow they've had since print died. The line about the Left destroying trust and respect in the justice system... I don't get that at all. The left didn't hold the supreme court vacancy hostage, stack the courts at a breakneck speed, or overturn long-standing precedents on vital human rights issues. 

I've never heard the concentration camp thing but that is very much why people are terrified of a second Trump term now that he's immune from prosecution. This isn't hearsay stuff, this is pointing out shit he's retweeted about rounding up political rivals like last week. I dunno man, Trump's whole thing is making enemies.

"Thank you for answering the question. 

I just want people to realize that there actually is a concerted effort by the media to push certain narratives. They will pick and chose what information you are allowed to see and hear in a contentious effort to brain wash us. They can have half the population believing a certain thing (whatever the current thing is). While the other half tries to explain what they are seeing is bullshit, the half being lied to don't want to hear it from them.

They think. how could I be wrong? Well, sometimes we are wrong. This is why this particular sub reddit is important. Because we get to honestly peel back the curtain and have honest discussions.

"They can't just shoot right away if they are only 99.9% sure it's a shooter. They need to be 100% sure.

They were warned by the public, spotted the guy and took aim, then the USSS sniper needs to wait for confirmation.

Police on their way to the rooftop to investigate, people scrambling to find out if some other agency has a guy on that roof, or if it can be a reporter with some long distance video or audio equipment, or a kid playing with a fake gun... Or like some dumb with a real rifle that just wanted to see the event, couldn't get in so he grabbed the only binoculars he had in his car (his rifle scope) to view the event from a distance. If they accidentally shoot an innocent person because they ""had a pretty good hunch it could be a shooter"" it would be a disaster for Trump's campaign. So I'm sure there are procedures in place that prevent them from accidentally shooting someone. As soon as the shooter fired of course they had their 100% confirmation and took the shot immediately.

If they would shoot a guy without being a full 100% sure , THAT would be the conspiracy.

"It's one of the hallmarks that tell me this is a staged event.  Even Trump would have security at all times to prevent it.

Imagine the balls and confidence it takes to even try to pull something like this off.  It is one thing sitting in your room fantasizing about it, getting angry, going out and doing some target practice but actually making the move?  

He would have had to have scouted the area, known the best angle of attack and that angle just happen to be wide open with easy access.

Right before the shots were fired she seems to consistently look to the side (where he would be) and raised her sign up rapidly but in a strange manner, still frantically looking to that side.

I’m not saying she was in on it but her body language is super weird. She had cat like reflexes when it came to putting the sign down and putting her phone up.

"Trump is a former president and a major presidential candidate, both which they have a mandate to protect. So he should be quite high on the list. Also even the lower tier of Secret Service should be able to do a high quality job. The problem is there are too much share/mix of responsibility, which makes them not communicate well. The shooter was confronted by a police officer on the roof that backed down, and he then proceeded to quickly position and fire a shot under that stress. This is why he missed. But that such a situation enfolded without Trump being protected is clearly a problem of communication. So there are multiple layers of failure. He shouldn't get up there with a rifle in the first place, but also, when confronted, there should be an immediate alarm that took Trump under protection within a few seconds.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadXlVdnNMcTRvVlZTNm5HQnY2SnRZQ0hXTy1HNlBoTHZOdzhmZW9fNHR3cDZZWVkxTXpfb1dxWmhueXlOR1JvNG0zVUh3UEtKZHlUOFRISkJhMm1qbVE9PQ==

" Some of the principal data that must be explained:

    The Twin Towers were destroyed faster than physics can explain by a free fall speed ""collapse.""
    They underwent mid-air pulverization (dustification) and were turned to dust before they hit the ground.
    The protective bathtub was not significantly damaged by the destruction of the Twin Towers.
    The rail lines, the tunnels and most of the rail cars had only light damage, if any.
    The WTC underground mall survived well, witnessed by Warner Bros. Road Runner and friends. There were reports that ""The Gap"" was looted.
    The seismic impact was minimal, far too small based on a comparison with the Kingdome controlled demolition.
    The Twin Towers were destroyed from the top down, not bottom up.
    The demolition of WTC7 was whisper quiet and the seismic signal was not significantly greater than background noise.
    The upper 80 percent, approximately, of each tower was turned into fine dust and did not crash to the earth.
    The upper 90 percent, approximately, of the inside of WTC7 was turned into fine dust and did not crash to the earth.
    One file cabinet with folder dividers survived.
    No toilets survived or even recognizable portions of one.
    Windows of nearby buildings had circular and other odd-shaped holes in them.
    In addition to the odd window damage, the marble facade was completely missing from around WFC1 and WFC2 entry, with no other apparent structural damage.
    Fuzzballs, evidence that the dust continued to break down and become finer and finer.
    Truckloads of dirt were hauled in and hauled out of the WTC site, a pattern that continues to this day.
    Fuming of the dirt pile. Fuming decreased when watered, contrary to fumes caused by fire or heat.
    Fuzzyblobs, a hazy cloud that appeared to be around material being destroyed.
    The Swiss-Cheese appearance of steel beams and glass.
    Evidence of molecular dissociation and transmutation, as demonstrated by the near-instant rusting of affected steel.
    Weird fires. The appearance of fire, but without evidence of heating.
    Lack of high heat. Witnesses reported that the initial dust cloud felt cooler than ambient temperatures. No evidence of burned bodies.
    Columns were curled around a vertical axis like rolled-up carpets, where overloaded buckled beams should be bent around the horizontal axis.
    Office paper was densely spread throughout lower Manhattan, unburned, often along side cars that appeared to be burning.
    Vertical round holes were cut into buildings 4, 5 and 6, and into Liberty street in front of Bankers Trust, and into Vesey Street in front of WTC6, plus a cylindrical arc was cut into Bankers Trust.
    All planes except top secret missions were ordered down until 10:31 a.m. (when only military flights were allowed to resume), after both towers were destroyed, and only two minutes (120 seconds) after WTC 1 had been destroyed.
    Approximately 1,400 motor vehicles were towed away, toasted in strange ways, during the destruction of the Twin Towers.
    The order and method of destruction of each tower minimized damage to the bathtub and adjacent buildings.
    More damage was done to the bathtub by earth-moving equipment during the clean-up process than from the destruction of more than a million tons of buildings above it.
    Twin Tower control without damaging neighboring buildings, in fact all seriously damaged and destroyed buildings had a WTC prefix.
    The north wing of WTC 4 was left standing, neatly sliced from the main body which virtually disappeared.
    For more than seven years, regions in the ground under where the main body of WTC4 stood have continued to fume.
    The WTC1 and WTC2 rubble pile was far too small to account for the total mass of the buildings.
    The WTC7 rubble pile was too small for the total mass of the building and consisted of a lot of mud.
    Eyewitness testimony about toasted cars, instant disappearance of people by ""unexplained"" waves, a plane turning into a mid-air fireball, electrical power cut off moments before WTC 2 destruction, and the sound of explosions.
    Eyewitness testimony of Scott-pack explosions in fire trucks and fire trucks exploding that were parked near the WTC.
    There were many flipped cars in the neighborhood of the WTC complex near trees with full foliage.
    Magnetometer readings in Alaska recorded abrupt shifts in the earth's magnetic field with each of the events at the WTC on 9/11.
    Hurricane Erin, located just off Long Island on 9/11/01, went virtually unreported in the days leading up to 9/11, including omission of this Hurricane on the morning weather map, even though that portion of the Atlantic Ocean was shown on the map.
    Sillystring, the appearance of curious cork-screw trails.
    Uncanny similarities with the Hutchison Effect, where the Hutchison Effect exhibits all of the same phenomena listed above.

"It's advantageous to have secret service members with smaller frames, more bodies protecting the president means they can use more weapons in a smaller space.

Another advantage is having additional pairs of eyes, again because having a smaller frame means being able to fit more bodies in the same space as 2 NFL linemen. This makes it easier to spot a threat when you have comrades at your side helping you look over the same areas as you are, rather than just having one look this way and one look the other way.

"Slavery was abolished in the bill of rights dork. You clearly are a constitutional scholar.

No where in any document other than a ruling from the Supreme Court, does the FEDERAL government have the right to rule on the legality of abortion. The Supreme Court doesn’t have the ability to grant such rights, they can only nullify legislation. In cases where you see the court “legislating from the bench” you should see that as partisanship that is easily overturned. This was the complaint when the ruling was made, there was never a right established. This was low hanging fruit that no one wanted to touch till now.

There is no where on this earth that they can hide from the people that will then hunt them all down unlike at any other time in human history... Going to a bunker ? You'll be sealed into your tombs permanently ! At which maybe they do kill most of humanity anyways ?? But the survivors that will have lived through it are not going to forget ! You elites will never walk free upon the earth again .... they will kill you 

And for the minions .... If they kill us commoners ... Guess where that puts you then ? You will now be the new scum that they know you are . Nobody not even the tptb trust a traitor ! You have sold all of us out for chump change and now know too much ... They will kill you too . They can't allow someone that they turned against their own to stand .

"> , if that’s what you’re choosing to focus on in the argument, it just goes to show how much of a bot you really are.

I Think it's because an awful lot of the other side is claiming it's Democratic rhetoric to blame. like calling Trump a fascist over and over. That seems like it could not be the reason if the shooter was indeed conservative which it looks like it. This was an act of a madman, nothing good would come from this to anyone but his own ego. Hell the shooter may have died thinking he did it when he saw Trump go down. Who knows, but it sure doesn't look like the left or the right pushed him to do this, looks like an act of a mad man.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSFJXQTlUMVExUW5EeFdFWmVuZEN4RHdvWkU2UFczTTkwd2t2WFZ0T29sbHRwcHh3RUNtUlhSUWRKb0lVR2JaSWp3NnZjQlFvLXFCZk9fTFRJdE5VWXc9PQ==

"I had heard about the book of Enoch before the dream, but I had never heard of and did not know of Phanuel. I also had no idea about the contents in the book of Enoch. I just barely knew it was a thing before the dream.  
  
 I had to google the name Phanuel when I woke up to find out it was the name of an angel, and only then (AFTER the dream) learned that it is an angel mentioned in the book of Enoch.   
  
 I've been told that as for a logical explanation. My subconcious might have picked it up beforehand. So though I wasn't consciously aware of an angel called Phanuel, the knowledge might have been in my subconscious. Someone gave me this explanation as a logical counter-argument to it having been a miracle.   
  
 However the coincidence of dreaming about an angel I could swear I hadn't heard about, the SAME NIGHT, as my depression disappeared - was what tipped the scales for me as to this being beyond just mere coincidence.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhd3lHTDVuTTBXVFg0QXFNU2J6OVl6MkpyNzZZQ2M4VzhZcVlGSWZNak1xOVlGb3VQcEdFRGxOVGYtNkZuSWZ0d0NVckJDQ3FkTzZyRElocXFJSThScEE9PQ==

"Would be more prone to consider a nearly century old conspiracy and all the out of context claims if someone would advise how a WORLD WIDE surreptitious program that today would cost billions annually of (your currency here) to fund?

Who buys, builds/modifies jet aircraft air frames? Who houses & services thousands of dedicated aircraft and where? Who coordinates world wide activity, this has to be an International activity are no borders in atmosphere with jet stream, prevailing winds, dynamic weather patterns.

Who assures international coordination as to air traffic & dispersal areas - knowing that.. say.... Canada will not permit China to just spray 'something' in their air space. Russia and Europe may be a bit picky too.

The massive logistics of manufacturing, delivering, storing, loading the (chemicals) that are 'sprayed - anyone thought about that?' Hopefully anyone with an iota of common sense understands that contaminating turbofan jet engine fuel would cause massive aircraft engine failure! If you contaminated JP5/JP8 jet fuel with anything, much less a solid (powder?) that would not dissolve into solution or combust in equivalent characteristics, the aircraft would crash. The earth would be littered with the carcasses of such sabotaged air craft.

And, how do you ID a 'Chemtrail' vs. a contrail some 5-10 miles away at 30,000 Ft. ASL?  Taste? Smell? Dispersion depends upon ever changing atmospheric conditions, you know simple things like ... prevailing winds.

Would imagine with the proliferation of handheld devices with cameras, that since the mid 2000s we should be flooded with hardware and logistics proof?

The physics and conditions of contrails is common knowledge, and all the geoforming weather control activities  well documented as to scope and funding (past and ongoing).

"I didn’t think I’d have to break this down for you, but here we go.

The size of the building and the ladder leaning up against it indicates that it is between 22-28 foot ladder. If you’ve ever worked construction, you know these things are heavy and difficult to transport.

A ladder that long is 11-14 feet, not extended. He would need a pick up to transport that ladder. Impossible to do with any small car as it was indicated in the reports of “canisters” located in Crooks’ CAR.

So if he didn’t use a vehicle to get it there, what else would explain this.

“He could have carried it.” He lived too far away to make that happen. Also, the ladder is big and clunky, he would have knocked the rifle’s sight out if he walked it to that building.

The only other explanation is that the ladder was already there. It’s not fixed to the building, it’s leaning against it. This would have been located in the security sweep they did of that building.

Therefore, if the ladder was located near the building before the event, this would have been something they specifically looked for in their security sweep and they failed to remove it.

The only explanation on how the SS could have been so negligent in allowing this ladder to be accessible for someone to climb to the top of the ONLY building in that area in which there weren’t  SS agents is that the SS allowed it there.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNheWtvNS1zUFdJZmJRRDY0Sy1jbjFWZks1YXRtd0VSaDZrUFlCMXZaU01wcWc2UktVWXEydko1ZkhBdEt1cDVZck1udTNXVUFGZDVHX0FmQU5NV2M5NUE9PQ==

So my question is: if special counsel aren't allowed, then are we okay with the president (through the DOJ) *openly* investigating and prosecuting political rivals? If not, then you should also have a problem with Trump because that is what he promised to do if he gets re-elected.

One thing’s for sure:

This incident was predicted by a guy named Kim Clement back in 2014. He also predicted a terrorist attach in Chicago. Did you know DNC is in Chicago this year?

My theory is there will be a big thing that occurs, and Dems will turn around and blame it on extremist Republicans.  They are trying to incite civil war / civil strife like we always did to countries we overturned in the past.

In other words, our government is completely compromised, subverted and we are the victims of this.

"How about gauging the shutter speed of the camera?   Metadata on the photo will have the focal length of the lens and other valuable info.   I have a hard time believing that a small object traveling at 700mph is going to be caught in a photo unless the photographer was using an insanely fast shutter speed more consistent with photographing hummingbirds or lightning strikes, not still shots of a stationary individual from 10' or more away.    I just dont think a professional photographer is going to shoot at those speeds in this setting.

Also, I've been in the line of fire and bullets displace a LOT of air around them.   If a bullet grazed his ear I think youd likely see his fine hair brushed backwards or even his hat blown off.

">the cause of cancer is a lack of oxygen, and that cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, oxygen rich environment and thrives in an acidic, low oxygen environment.

Read again. The low oxygen environment is what encourages the cancer to grow (per this person, not me) and a high oxygen environment would discourage its growth.

Wim Hoff believes similar, and encourages the [Wim Hoff Breathing Method for healing](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/breathing-techniques), due to both high oxygenation of the blood during his breathing exercises (which are a form of hyperventilation) as well as the expression and release of carbon dioxide.

There is a theory that must of us as sedentary office workers and other sedentary jobs leading sedentary lives aren't breathing right, leaving us and our bodies with a lower oxygen environment internally, saturated with excess CO2 we have not properly exhaled as would have occurred normally through heavy physical activity.

Similar theories surround lymph fluid. Some of the most common cancers infect the lymph nodes.  Lymph fluid has no pump; it only circulates with movement. The theory goes our typically sedentary lifestyles inhibit this cleansing process.",r/conspiracy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcEIzMjZvOHdZcjY2RjcxX3ktUjZlVUxtNWl4ZlVXZHREckl6eW94SjB2WENmMmxDeDh6ZWFCZUNsZnZ4dTlBYk9idFZNdEJwdFB2blFTYXo5MXJzOXc9PQ==

"Why would you try to get make a special counsel without putting them in front of Congress? Why did Merrick Garland try to usurp the power of Congress to put this prosecutor as fundamentally a new executive officer, without the procedure of getting them approved first?  
Isn't the concept of a special counsel that you need them specifically because they're supposed to be fair, balanced, unconnected to the case, and good for the job.  
Why should Congress just accept that belief from the people who aren't fair, nor balanced, connected to the case, and bad for the job? The whole point of the special counsel is that 2 branches of government send them to the 3rd branch of government with the belief that the prosecutor can be appropriate for the case.

Any hateful content that upsets you, you spend time watching, and you respond to, will be continuously fed until you make it focus on something else.

Maybe you need to do a little more digging, because you are only finding out about this ""issue"" now, while some of us have been discussing this issue for 8 years now. 

I'm thinking that the only reason you even know what you do currently is because you got a recent NPC update and social media told you to be upset.

"Merrick Garland already broke the constitution when he made a Special Prosecutor and didn't put him in front of Congress. Now everyone is ridiculously outraged that the Trump case was thrown out on that technicality. However, Merrick Garland knows the law, he knows the past of Special Prosecutors going in front of Congress to be proven as unbiased and able to take the case. Theres been no problem with that process before.

So why did the man who was almost put on the Supreme Court himself break the constitution and processes of the Government just because he wanted to make a shortcut and not hold himself as an equal to Congress?   
It's almost as if he did it just so we would have headlines of ragebait of people mad that Trump got off on another of the DOJ's claimed crimes he has committed. Since they wouldnt understand the nuance of the practice. Yet he obviously would, so why did he do it?
