Past some point -- and Putin himself many not know where that is in advance -- Putin may decide to enforce a red line with a direct attack on the west. He may not expect western powers to enter the war as a consequence; he may just view it as a warning or a way of restoring deterrence. But he could misjudge the reaction.,r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcHNWS3lydjZ6QTkzakZXMXVBRjVtd2RlTGdRd3pjLTFpbTQ4ZkdnQVVpQlp4dEFXdDZITnBhb1hGbE5VLWNJQ1RkVlF1amphOGJ2THhzNTM0ekhYVHEtYjBrNlBXdmR4Z3JTdWtzV3BEWWc9

"Tube artillery is more efficient in terms of the propellant weight needed to push the same mass to the same distance compared to rocket artillery. They do this by containing the propellant burn and accelerate the payload quickly. This translate to you needing to ship much less propellants, dozens times less, to the gun. Rocket artillery is less efficient in this aspect because you accelerate and push both the warhead and the propellant in the initial stages and the propellant is burned as the rocket flies. You need a dozen times more propellant for rockets than tube. Propellants are mix of fuel and oxidizers: they are unstable with long-term storage. Meanwhile howitzer barrels have practically infinite storage life once slathered with cosmoline.

On the other hand, because of the high and sudden acceleration in tubes, it's harder to make electronics that will survive the acceleration and than more gradual acceleration of rockets. More of the tube shell need to be the steel casing (most of the weight of an HE shell is the steel casing). The rocket's warhead's outer wall may only need to be a light aluminium shell, leaving the hollow cavity to be filled with specialised payload (cluster munitions, scatmines, thermobarics, bunker busting, etc ...)

Tube artillery platforms are also heavier than the equivalent range and payload rocket platforms. What this means in practice is that a gun that fires a shell to the same range as that of an ATACMS will be of ridiculous size and weight. 

What this ends up in practice is that most tubes above 155 mm and about 30km with RAPs are scrapped. Conversely, very few or no rocket system between the range of 120mm mortars (about 10km) and 30km, unless the platform weight is an issue (e.g. airborne troops). It doesn't seem to be worth it to have an MBT-barrel-length gun in 155 mm to shoot beyond about 30km with RAPs (RIP to ERCA); probably barrel wear issues. For very heavy payloads (>1000 kg) and >40 km, use aviation bombs.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZmxjekZZUGp6U0NROVlTN244dkh3emZncjZMZHhTNXE1dGRidm9OZVFrVS1FeXJpMm5icGpQaVRTS01ka2lkM0RCVGNRMFRvS2tGc1VGSHFjUnZRYThqZU11U3E2bF85Ni1ES1VoaFhORDg9
"> It’s why Russia did nothing when their red lines over western tanks, cruise missiles, SPGs or anything else were crossed, red lines have to be backed up by actual capabilities and willingness, and Russia has neither when it comes to war with NATO.

They are committing sabotage, targeted assassinations and other destructive acts on NATO soil. They can [or have] cause significant damage to undersea communication cables and such in the Baltic sea. So, yes, they do have avenues to respond and escalate - And they are.

Edit: For example earlier this year the Germans & Americans foiled an assassination plot against Rheinmetalls CEO. If that had succeeded; How would NATO respond? If the Russians miscalculate that response it can be much larger than expected which requires a counter-response. Now you have an escalation-ladder out of control.

Especially the Armavir one that surveils most of Eastern Europe i.e they might not even know if they were launched from deep within Western Europe of from Ukraine.

"GirkinGirkin (Ukranian Girkin) reposted this chart from a Russian TG source compiling the rapid increase of signing bonuses by Oblast for Russian contract soldiers. These contract soldiers make up the vast majority of both current troops and new recruits going to Ukraine.

From Aug 2023 to July 2024, the signing bonuses have skyrocketed, especially in the Oblasts that had low or no bonus at the beginning. The average bonus went from 270k rubles (~3k USD) to 930k rubles (~10k USD), with most of the increase happening after April 2024. I'll note that the median salary in Russia is ~10k USD, so this is a LOT of money for the average Russian.

"[**Ukraine’s F-16 Ambitions Snarled by Language Barrier, Runways and Parts**](https://archive.is/0DXRf)

An article that provides the best and most honest summary yet of the challenges Ukraine is facing trying to get its promised F-16 fleet in country and off the ground. An already complicated deployment is being further hampered by political considerations by US leadership that, three years into the conflict, seems unable to grasp the reality of the situation, both in terms of what is at stake for them personally, and what resources they have at their disposal to achieve the outcomes they desire.  Emphasis is mine.

>The move to send warplanes — a much-hyped element of this week’s NATO summit in Washington — has been bedeviled by delays, questions around spare parts, and a language barrier between Ukrainian pilots and their foreign trainers, according to people familiar with the matter. Planners also worry that the country doesn’t have enough runways — and those it does have are vulnerable to Russian attacks.

Legitimate concerns, but ultimately solvable problems. The F-16 has one of the deepest reserves of spare airframes and parts anywhere in the world, so the ""questions"" about spare parts must be about willingness rather than availability. 

>The result is that Ukraine may be able to field a squadron of F-16s, anything from 15 to 24 jets, well short of the 300 its leaders have called for, according to one of the people. **Another said Kyiv expects to get six F-16s this summer and up to 20 by the end of the year.**

Six planes are hilariously inadequate. Ukraine would be better off stalling the introduction of F-16s entirely until they can field a squadron at least. As it is, the planes will be nothing more than missile bait and a chance for Russia to adapt to a new threat before it can strike a decisive blow, to say nothing of the propaganda coup that will inevitably result.

>It took more than a year to get here. President Joe Biden dropped his opposition to sending F-16s to Ukraine in May 2023, after repeated pleas by Zelenskiy and allies to allow their transfer. Training of Ukrainian pilots began soon after but analysts have argued that the administration has been dragging its feet on introducing the aircraft — partly out of fear that it will provoke President Vladimir Putin.

Yet another article that lays the responsibility for slow-walking aid at the feet of Joe Biden. I would speculate that the bizarre restrictions on pilot class size fall into the category of feet-dragging as well. It was always a strange argument that the country literally at war couldn't bump a peacetime nation or two off the list, or at the very least stretch the class size.

What makes this particularly frustrating is that, given the Biden administration's situation, now is the time to be leaning forward in terms of risk posture. The goal should be to lock in as much sustainable long-term support for Ukraine as possible, put on a big show of resolve, and ensure that, if Kyiv is forced into negotiations in January, they have at least some momentum going into negotiations. Now is the time to be drawing up the Tet Offensive, not planning out Vietnamization 2.0. At the risk of getting political, these are not the actions of an administration that understands it will likely be out of power in six months. Echo chambers don't just exist in foreign authoritarian nations, and a delusional commander-in-chief has far more negative effects than just losing an election.

>“The enthusiasm of our leaders for rapidly developing a demonstrative air capability for Ukraine is lacking,” said Philip Breedlove, NATO’s chief commander at the time of Russia’s 2014 takeover of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. “We do not want to have to face what might occur if Ukraine was to develop a very successful capability quickly.”",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYby1WTWZhQlZnVjRPVUxTR19zQXhTT3lKelBYazZRMlNZUEpBcmdMRW9nWlVQeEZUVUppbWIwc1BmeVRXV0R3R1NZbE1PbjNQWlBZak8tQmNEcE1ON2c9PQ==
"This has become tiring and while many smarter folks have dismissed this logic I’ll try again. Appeasement doesn’t get you off the escalation ladder it only moves you higher. It didn’t work after Georgia, it didn’t work after Crimea, it didn’t work after Syria and it didn’t work in the lead up to the invasion and since. Russia has been carrying out sabotage and assassinations in NATO for over a decade. It does so exactly because it believes that the west will not respond. Killing the CEO would not have been the first time they killed a EU citizen in NATO territory. Deterring yourself because of fears of Russian miscalculation and stupidity isn’t going to win you peace it’s just going to get you in a worse position where all you can do is react kinetically yourself or risk losing all appearances of credibility. To avoid being forced into those options the best thing you can do is help defend those who are at the front lines already fighting in the defense of their country.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcnpCSmJaQkhJanlXZGVyTzJSR0MyN3k3LVlKNXRjaXBjMm0xV21LYy1MVlRpOEhRYzFDRlN1QlhXRnNKd1k5Y19oOW80TzVtYXRzNUxCYXhmMWRiTVE9PQ==

"Rockets and missiles are not the same as shells and mortars. It is estimated that Hezbollah can fire 3,000 rockets/missiles per day, so 150,000 is enough for them to fire for about 2 months.

A comparison to Ukraine makes little sense. The frontline in Ukraine is much larger than what the Lebanon-Israel frontline will be. The Donetsk Oblast is the same size as Israel and twice the size of Lebanon. The sheer scale of the Ukraine-Russia war simply means they go through a lot more ammo.

And Ukraine and Russia are fighting a prolonged war of attrition across entrenched lines, so they are blowing through millions of shells. A war between Israel and Hezbollah will be fundamentally political and relatively short-lived. Hezbollah's goal will be to destroy as much of Israeli infrastructure and inflict as many casualties as possible to demoralize the Israeli public and force an Israeli withdrawal.

"> They are committing sabotage, targeted assassinations and other destructive acts on NATO soil.

And they have been doing this since long before 2022. To paraphrase from a comment I made elsewhere on the thread, the wests policy, starting with Russia’s invasion of Georgia, was to not retaliate for Russian acts of aggression and provocation, and hope they can be reigned in by trade alone. The result of this policy was a steadily deteriorating security situation in Europe, culminating in the current state of chaos.

Russia’s policy is to manufacture whatever provocation they feel is necessary to do what they already intended to. The reason they haven’t assassinated more people, or cut more cables, isn’t because they’re waiting for NATO to cross a red line, if they were they’d have done so after SPGs were sent, one of the first red lines. Or because they want to avoid provoking the west, they’ve deployed chemical weapons in the UK. It’s because they are the attacks they think will benefit them, and that they have the capability to perform. The reason they think these attacks are beneficial is because of the previously noted strategy of refusing to retaliate, rather than engage in deterrence.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYendtU0Z1cFdNY2xlR2JMajVIQjBqSzBOMVFHdWgyd3NTYlZyMXdNZ2I5dVJOMXJMbGUzSkVfNWd1XzhEVktaUldNTnBVTF84SEdMUElKM2xTaHk3eUVKQk9xTHBpcjFVV1VuclRCV0ZNQ0E9

"> Probably the best approach would be to push as many Ukrainian pilots as possible through a full immersion English program and teach in English. But even with that you're talking a multi year effort.

It's worth mentioning that there's a general 'help Ukrainians learn English' program operating since the start of the war.

> **Why does ENGin operate in Ukraine?**  
Ukraine ranks 31st of 35 European countries in English proficiency, even though most students study English in school. Ukrainian schools often focus on grammar and vocabulary, and students have few opportunities to actually speak English. At the same time, spoken English fluency is essential for many academic and professional opportunities - particularly now, with the job market in flux due to the war and many Ukrainians displaced. By helping Ukrainian students learn to speak fluently, we can have a huge impact, truly changing their life trajectories.

"Yes and no. Being shot out of a literal cannon is not going to result in an accurate INS, regardless of how precisely it knew where it was before firing (This is also believed to contribute to why the SDB remains fairly effective in Ukraine, but the GLSDB failed)

Excaliburs are generally fired at ~70 degrees elevation with the intention that it uses GPS to get its position, and can navigate to the target from there using GPS when it can, and INS when it can't. 

However, that may still leave it vulnerable to GPS spoofing attacks, or jamming during the critical first ~3 seconds of flight.

Note that the cheaper alternative to Excalibur, the M1156 PGK, doesn't have INS (although the M1156E2/A1 is rumored to at least use GPS-M), so it's not very useful in this conflict.

There is little public discussion on what this entails in practice. Most sources agree that it will include an anti tunneling barrier similar to the one built along the Israeli Gaza border.

As for the width of the corridor, nothing is formally stated. Though nothing formally has been stated about the Netzarim corridor either, but images show that initially it was built to the width of [2km and recently is being widened to 4km](https://x.com/orfialkov/status/1808454264395608433)

Difference between Philadelphi and Netzarim is that the city [Rafah is hugging the border](https://sovereignlimits.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/EGY_GAZ_land_sketch_vert_01-01.png) the closest houses were just tens of meters away. Clearing a 4km corridor would mean leveling most of Rafah city, which isn't practical due to the enormous amount of resources it'll require and likely international backlash.

There are ongoing efforts to build a corridor, it's anyone's guess how wide it'll end up at Rafah (it's pretty easy to make it wide outside the city to the west and east, for most of the border).

"C’mon now, let’s be realistic about this. No wartime nation, and especially not the Ukraine we’ve seen from 2022, would slow-walk the introduction of aviation assets as you describe. F-16s will be performing combat missions within weeks or at most months of being delivered. Just like HIMARS, Storm Shadow, or Western-trained Ukrainians.

Also, the situation on the ground is nowhere near protected enough to allow for missions like IFF familiarization. F-16s are going to be the subject of an intense Russian ISR campaign. Every time they take off they run the risk of exposing their operating base, and the Russians absolutely will devote the resources required to destroy those airfields. If they had 30 or 40 planes this year they could afford to risk planes for a low-return operation. But given the low number in theater, even losing one or two jets would be catastrophic in terms of combat effectiveness.

"Would being able to strike airfields in Russia really stop the missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure? If Ukraine has managed to disperse their aircraft then it's almost certain that Russia will eventually adapt as well.

Surely the best way to prevent strikes on Ukraine is to make targets in Russia vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes to such an extent that it's in Russia's interest to de-escalate in that area of the war. Much like both countries avoid unrestricted naval warfare in the Black Sea, because both can hurt each other and it's in the interest of neither to have their commercial shopping stopped.

"It is much more difficult to disperse assets for strategic bombing such as Tu-22M3, Tu-95 or Tu-160's than tactical aircraft like say Su-25 or Su-34's. 

The longer runways that are required, and the logistics for maintaining such large (and less rugged) aircraft are things that make dispersing such assets more difficult. There's only a bunch of airbases that can host such a fleet.

Not to mention that a well placed strike in the pilot's barracks would be devastating since these are very valuable assets requiring years of training. Just look at the average age of the pilots that striked the Children's hospital in that leaked photo. They seem to all be in their 40's or 50's.

The battle for Sudan continues.

[Battle begins for eastern Sudanese city] (https://sudanwarmonitor.com/p/battle-begins-for-eastern-sudanese)

It seems the army still hold's Sennar city, details of the battle are murky but it seems the RSF manged to overrun the outlying villages and some defences  set up. They lost at least a few officers  during this attack from several directions but managed to repel the RSF. Baraa Bin Malik Brigade a Islamist group lost one of their top commanders in the battle.

Other news seems the e African Union and the East African bloc are trying to arrange dialogue between the RSF and Junta with some civilian parties boycotting it with the exception of the Islamists ones  feeling they are just acting as a rubber stamp for the army. As a demonstration of how these talks are a charade for both sides to the outside world  Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo leader of the RSF has fired his political advisor, Youssif Ezzat for making a positive comment about the last conference bringing peace. Both the army and RSF are very sensitive  to their base at least when it comes to the idea of this  war being anything other than all or nothing. 

In more depressing news Doctors Without Borders announced its decision to withdraw its staff from the Turkish Hospital in in RSF Khartoum after facing a lot of abuse. It's hard to say if it was the RSF though given the rise of criminal gangs as the state has collapsed.

Seems the RSF have been keeping the pressure up they launched a attack on Babanusa which killed at least 2 SAF soldiers but lost a couple more men. Army is bragging about this but the purpose of this is less to take the city but make sure they don't try to send relief forces out to try and aid the other army garrisons under siege.

By leaving protection.

To further highlight how the term Islamist is thrown around as pr by the RSF they've recently incorporated one from Bashir's government as he's the right type of Arab.

>Hemedti has appointed Hasbou Abdelrahman the former Vice President of Sudan under Bashir and the former Secretary General of the Islamist movement in Sudan as an advisor. Any claim that the RSF is fighting Islamists at this point is beyond ridiculous. Hasbou and Hemedti come from the same nomadic Arab ethnic background that is what binds them; the RSF is an ethnic militia fighting for ethnic dominance and control. It has never had an issue with Islamists in fact the militia existed for more than a decade as the principle violent enforcers for Bashir’s deposed Islamist regime!

"There's no way America or any rational general can send outdated F-16s into the thickest SAM field in the world realistically without allowing deep strike from ATACMS right? There's a lot of prestige riding on how these F-16s work. Is it fair? Not really, but that's how imagery works. Ukraine is gonna have to be really conservative with their F-16s initially. Defensive CAP and air defense work. Maybe some maritime patrol.

Hell, deep strike into airbases in Russia would allow for more work than F-16s imo.

Together they would be a potent combo. Especially if the US sends ALCM to bolster ATACMS numbers. It does seem like the US is in a better spot long range munition wise than commonly thought.

>Canada has done a detailed mapping of what it says are covert Chinese police operations within its borders and wants to explore a response with Group of Seven allies to a challenge faced by several nations.
>The issue of Beijing allegedly setting up unofficial “police stations” in Western democracies — to monitor and intimidate members of the Chinese diaspora — has become a growing concern. Canada, the US, Italy, Germany and the UK have all grappled with the problem.
>Ottawa is expected to share its findings with the G-7 in the coming weeks and wants to explore a coordinated response, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet public.
>A spokesperson for China’s embassy in Ottawa said in a statement that “there are no so-called overseas police stations.”
>The UK is eager to coordinate along with Canada and other G-7 members, one of the officials said. But harmonizing a response could be complicated since many nations have confronted the issue at a law-enforcement level, and countries within the bloc have different legal systems, another official noted.
>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has said it’s investigating allegations of clandestine Chinese police operations, including “credible” information in the second-largest province of Quebec.

>on a side note, most of the ruined bodies were blurred out or covered by a tarp, this is evident in every news reporting of the incident)

You're watching filtered vids from the news, I'm watching raw footage from the ground. The vast majority of bodies and wounded were not covered up in those vids since the vids took place **before** that.

It is obvious that you're not interested in a honest discussion. Out of Palestinians claims of 90+ dead and 300 wounded, you were able to produce one vid of a lightly wounded girl. Even if there were 10 such, the demographic would still be abnormal. Where in most large scale Israeli strikes a number of children and women die due to the nature of the Gaza demographic and the widespread use of human shields.

You can check yourself, by searching vids from the hostages rescue raid for instance, or just the bombings in Nuseirat yesterday (with much fewer fatalities overall, yet sadly images/vids of child fatalities). In most strikes with 20+ killed there are vids/images of child fatalities, for a series of strikes that killed 90 it's highly abnormal (not unheard of, there were some rare such examples early in the war such as a strike of the Hamas HQ in Jabaliya).",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUm81cm5VQmFRT01KQldrYXBYcjB2bWRiWWVHZG94Q0owbFJGTFN5bkdxeUk5NktCLWV4U3F1VmNuZlNucXQ5VDhDNzgzbDFMYlpucDlKdWVlZUtaV1E9PQ==

"I would like the US to give Ukraine the weapons that they need(based on the US assessments not Ukraine) in the quantity they need them. 

But that brings into question escalation. I'm posed with a difficult choice of pursue freedom and democracy and defeat communism and risk a nuclear war or cut bait and run and let this be a lesson to the rest of NATO. Yes I think there is a real threat of a nuclear detonation.

I've decided that I will pursue freedom and democracy at any cost. We have the capability to cripple Russias military complex completely, no if.

 It would be bloody.

The real threat is China based on all assessments. They are formidable and growing at a staggering rate, learning from our mistakes, stealing IP's, building up complex NETWORKS of air defence, massive investments in their naval force, leading the field of hypersonics and using AI for what most westerners would call unethical reasons.

This needs to be a wake up call to the US. We have been preparing for a war on our terms against inferior militarys. If we continue to invest in these overpriced platforms that cost to the tens of hundreds of billions, we are going to lose the war with China. 

Though, the DOD is moving towards embracing the public sector and making it easy for smaller companies to work with them. This is a huge step if it's seen through.

The reality is our expensive planes, missiles, air defence, ships etc are all based on the fact we fight the war we want. They are effective at what they do, but less so against a adversary that is building solely to exploit weakness.

China could without question, sink a carrier group and multiple within moments. It would require less than you think. In only a few moments 5000+ Americans would be killed. All because we think the US military is what it was in the early 2000s.

"Absolutely not.

What you said goes against what the US government  itself has said. China is ahead of us in the hypersonic missile category. Why? Not because we are incompetent or lacking funding. 

Why would we develop a extremely expensive anti ship platform when we WERE the only country that had the ships that those missiles are intended for. 


Also there is no need to penetrate land based air defences. While the PLA most certainly can hit the US mainland, they will be focused on making the pacific a graveyard. 

Your correct when you say that China has little experience penetrating air defences. That's why they skipped over the mumbo jumbo and invested in hypersonics.

"NATO's military capabilities are down to 90% US, 10% others, and some here may still consider this an understatement. So when it comes to security it's not like Europe has that much of a choice. And talking of agency: there's the fact of the 90% happening to be controlled from within a single house, the White House. Compare this to the rest. In a very real sense, there simply are no Europeans any more than there are ""Asians"" when it comes to something like planning for after November. Who the next president is going to be, even how much it really matters, is such a completely different thing depending on whether you're in Estonia or Poland, or Spain or Portugal. This is running a gamut from existential to preference. It's worlds apart.

Also nothing against American grassroots ideals yet (barring a binding referendum) voters may not realistically decide on the future of NATO.

Now there's the worst bloodshed since WWII with horrible conflicts on both of the continent's landlocked axes. Trump's never going to undermine NATO.

"The point with F-16 has always been that it's a needed redundancy to deny Russian air superiority and ensure that Russia will not be able to conduct an offensive with air support.

It came at significant cost to the UAF and according to RUSI they would not be able to do that role again if Russia were able to rally resources to suppress the network again.

F-16s, optimistically, would be able to push the Russian CAP umbrella back and perhaps re-enable Byraktar sorties on the front line.

"It's not been a good week to be a civilian in Sudan. 



[Sudanese military targets South Sudanese for mass deportation](https://sudanwarmonitor.com/p/mass-deportations-white-nile.) 

The Sudanese army has deported at least 2,000 people to South Sudan. Details are a bit unclear of how exactly this crackdown is going. Some say it's ethnic with groups seen as fighting with the RSF like the Nuer are being expelled while the other's are being allowed to stay while being sent to the Ethiopian refuge camps or it's touch and go whatever the local army force choice. Over a thousand have been moved to refuge camps.

A bit of context, pre war Sudan had a million refuges though that in itself is a complex category with plenty of South Sudanese. First wave where people who never left Sudan after 2011 either because they settled down or feared the instability. Then another wave hit when the South Sudanese civil war began. A lot of those being returned are hostile to the South Sudanese government.


Looks like the Sudanese air force has been using barrel bombs like the government in Syria.

> ''The National Observatory for Human Rights - Sudan expresses its deep sorrow over the bloody massacre committed by Sudanese army aviation against unarmed citizens in the city of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state. The bombing operation left dozens dead and wounded, most of them children and women. Aerial bombardments with explosive barrels against civilians are war crimes and grave human rights violations that have been committed by aviation in the Darfur region, in which regime aircraft have committed genocide against the population for nearly twenty years. The Observatory calls on international human rights organizations concerned with human rights to condemn the massacres committed by aviation against populated areas. It is necessary to ban flights on the cities of Khartoum, Al-Jazira, Sennar, Blue Nile and Darfur. We call on the Sudanese army to stop targeting civilians with explosive barrels, out of respect for human rights first and in response to the United Nations agreements that guarantee citizens the right to civil protection in areas of armed conflict.''

https://x.com/TNOHRVS/status/1812391353042522157


This requires a bit of context not justifying this but this barrel bombing is on a ''cleansed area''. The battle for Geneina attracted international news for the RSF massacring 5,000 people in a week mainly non Arabs and burying them in mass graves sometimes alive with the rest of the ''anti'' RSF population  fled with their homes being taken over by RSF fighters and their families some of which came all the way from Niger. In other words this a indiscriminate attack on a opposition held area that killed civilians a war crime. As a result of this though plenty on Sudanese twitter as celebrating it given what the RSF have done to Sudan, the rhetoric of total war and atrocities committed have paved the way to this.

Overall we can expect this war to get worse for the civilians as the SAF takes the gloves off airstrikes and the nation continues to starve and RSF keep looting.

Though aside from that one concerning issue has been Ethiopia's dam project, Egypt's anxiety regarding it are well known.
https://www.newarab.com/news/fears-disaster-egypt-ethiopia-prepares-fill-nile-dam

Less well known is that Sudan also had a lot of objections but both backdown as well as given how Sudan get's it's water is less a mortal threat than Egypt. That is should it be in a ''golden'' year without this horrendous civil war, perfect harvest and things generally going okay you would likely see Sudan have to transition to having their water supply and own damming projects for development  being affected by Ethiopia's mega project I think you would see Sudan suffering a bit. No worries of that now given there was barely a harvest this year most of the population has been displaced, gotten their crops robbed or decided to hoard it for their own survival  than sell it.

It's something I'd keep a reminder for the post war if it happens, the Sudanese pie might in general be smaller even without the damage for the war given the now permanent changes in the region. Sudan's leadership will face a struggle in rebuilding their nation.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNab3JYU01CTVlYUWIyWXVpaWhfcUthbjBUdUdOREsxZHdCQUp1WkxVY0RuajZNb29vYkgwWWxoMDF2MGdqVnRRcmdyeExBQkFqcC1kcFRPOWtSSkw2NFE9PQ==
"A slightly bizarre update from Myanmar, where the Brotherhood has [suspended combat operations](https://www.barrons.com/news/myanmar-alliance-says-agreed-4-day-ceasefire-with-military-in-shan-state-cf83e68c?refsec=topics_afp-news) for the next four days. They are fighting in and around the city of Lashio, which is heavily defended by government forces. 

> ""We...showed cooperation with China by agreeing a four-day ceasefire in northern Shan"" from 14-18 July, Major-General Tar Bhone Kyaw of the TNLA told AFP.

> The new agreement did not cover the neighbouring Mandalay region, where members of the alliance and other opponents of the military have been battling junta troops in recent weeks, Tar Bhone Kyaw said.

The reasoning behind the brief ceasefire is not entirely clear, though there is speculation that Beijing told them to stand down for its Third Plenum, which runs until the 18th. While the dates match up, I'm personally skeptical of the reasoning. Lashio was hardly likely to fall in the next few days, and the fighting has been going on for weeks now. And even supposing it did fall, there's still no obvious connection between a city in Myanmar and a Chinese bureaucratic conclave; no obvious reason why anything happening to the former would affect the running of the latter. While Chinese influence over the Brotherhood is considerable, it's not unlimited—else they wouldn't have broken the Chinese-brokered ceasefire in the first place—and compelling them to stand down will have taken political capital.

"I think the consensus so far has been that they will make a difference, but we are talking incremental gains, not a ""game changer""

F-16s will have two main benefits:

1. Addressing attrition to the Ukrainian airforce. Ukraine is high secretive about the status of it's airforce, but we have several instances of confirmed losses. I've seen estimates that Ukraine only has about 70 combat capable aircraft remaining. Yes, AD will limit how active they can be, but there are roles like anti drone operations far away from the front lines for which AD is not a major consideration.

2. Giving Ukraine airframes that it can actually maintain. Ukraine can't source replacement parts from Russia. And while there are NATO countries operating Sukhoi and MiG aircraft, this is a finite and limited resource that has already been heavily tapped.

Navigation is also difficult because towns are often blacked out at night.

"I don’t think “in order to be effective” is a good phrase … they’re going to be effective, but not at the level that CSIS is talking about, which would essentially aim to fully rival the Russians for air superiority over Ukraine’s air space ... a massive task. 216 aircraft, as CSIS suggested, rivals most countries on earth for number of combat airframes. Keeping them all in the air would feel as stressing as adding a new country worth of air force and maintaining it. It may not even be a question of “worth it” so much as “is that even possible?” As in, the Western world’s struggles with artillery shell production should mirror the issues we may have with spare parts, munitions, training for pilots and support staff … bottlenecks all the way down.

"They have Link 16. A data sharing protocol, its 90s so it shares in the kb/s rate. But its enough for information on location, some status like fuel, weapon status and so on to pass between system. This means it will be able to integrate with the Partiots, the AWACs that may arrive and the electronic warfare units that have been donated so everything works in a much more coordinated fashion. In western doctrine the pilot would be the lead and everything else supporting rather than having a ground controller watching a radar and trying to run the battlespace. 

They also get data from GPS organic into the weapon systems. This should allow for better targeting, systems can be targeted dynamically and the EW pods can feed information into the HARMs so once they work out the training, they will be far better at SEAD (forcing Russians to turn off radars so other aircraft can make closer runs. )

Another advantage they will bring is some at least have Sniper targeting pods, so they will be far more able to get devastating hits in support of front line operations. 

They may be far better at avoiding spoofing and jamming of GPS, but they are oldish systems so that one is not known, I know even modern airliners have issues with the spoofing and jamming, but perhaps they were not hardened to it, or its not something turned on. 

Radar and the processing should have far better acuity if not range. Better target selection more able to burn through jamming. 

So at first its going to be hitting some cruise missiles. But expect the mission profiles to become more complex as the other components of the system become more used to getting feeds from and sending too the aircraft. This will take time to learn, unless their has been a really good training program already?

But as the ship numbers grow and experience and capacity is gained you should see much more western style complex multi ship opps with real SEAD, modern EW, coordinating with the Patriots and if it arrives the AWACs.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNUJ5SEZuRXNrSmtxOE9IdThYUjJYWURDMkU4YzU1UVRYaFAtdENhcTFKUC1qWGdVYU93SWxieWJmd0c1MGk3bzNnRXpHdFRVeFppcC1mdlBmbVUteHc9PQ==

They also lack anything like the NCO layer that's the ""get shit done"" spine of NATO armies.

Additionally once the kinetic initial phase of the war ended most of it is static positional warfare along a very long front.

">Why are there so many videos (from the Ukraine war) showing only small squads or even a few men, but nothing when it comes to larger forces?

>Are assaults not done with larger armies anymore

Does not mean there are not attacks in other parts of the line at the same time.

It may be (it's likely to be) a variation on what is called ""infiltration tactics"", these were developed in WWI near the end to over come the massed entrenchments. You use small squads to hit locations, preferably weak points, try to over run them and then have the follow up mop up the strong points.

Real war is nothing like the movies. What we may be seeing is a phase where the troops are bussed in on APCs and IFV, this is where you see the drones striking vehicles. Then a phase where they have been debussed and trying to storm trenches, this is when you will see them on the ground running around at something.

What we don't see is a classic line of IFVs mixed with the troops in old school soviet style, firing to support the advance. Or the IFVs in over watch, giving it hammer to support them in the more NATO style of the 80s.

It ""seems"" to be the much more 60 style of dropping them off and wishing them well from an APC and leaving them to do the storming phase on their own with a stiff upper lip and the good wishes of the senior officers.

The density of mines, kamikaze drones and the accuracy of modern artillery and proliferation of ATGMs play a role. Lack of training may play a bigger role.

"Just to note, the 10 Leopard 2s from Spain are part of the 19 they promised to deliver in March this year. The 10 were supposed to be ready to be shipped by the end of June, with the remaining 9 coming in September. Spain sent 6 in April 2023 and 4 in July 2023 as well. That makes 20 shipped with 9 more promised. 

Also to note, the refurbishment is done by General Dynamics Europe Land Systems-Santa Barbara Sistemas, making it unique as General Dynamics produces the Abrams. However, they bought SBS which is where Spain's Leopard 2Es were assembled, and its primary repair facility.

"There’s YouTube channel called Covert Cabal that’s ran by a guy who purchased commercial sats and tasks them to image Russian stockpile sites, then analyzes them. 

He shows the images themselves so it’s a good primary source, and it does in fact show that Russian equipment, specifically IFVs, APCs, and tanks, are being burned through at a completely unsustainable rate. Obviously we can’t say they have x years of supply left because usage will be throttled according to available stores, but if I’m remembering correctly he estimated about a year and half at current consumption rates, with an accompanying degradation in force quality as older and older systems must be renovated. His assumptions around unserviceable systems seem reasonable as well, although that will allow some wiggle room in his estimates. 

Foreign sourcing is unlikely to be a great fix to the problem as there are relatively few countries that are: willing to sell to Russia, have enough spare AFVs to sell, and have recent/well maintained enough AFVs to be useful.

Not for a long time, no.  Attacks above company-level are mostly extinct, and company-level attacks are rare enough to be notable on their own accord.

It's part of why the large human crowds (and even then, we're talking 50-100 people, so company-level) of the early Russian Kharkiv offensive in May were so odd, they were in broad daylight and relied entirely on the Ukrainian artillery being caught unprepared.  Unfortunately, they were.

"The Kyiv Post has posted reporting on an investigation into the 59th and possible incompetence in their leadership leading to recent losses in men, equipment, and defensive positions/towns.  

[ Army to Investigate Infantry Brigade Over Claims of Defeat in Pokrovsk Sector | Kyiv Post | July 2024](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/35844)

*The Ukrainian military’s overall commander General Oleksandr Syrsky on Monday ordered a formal investigation into allegations top officers in a combat brigade deployed to the critical eastern Pokrovsk sector had lost ground and soldier lives because of tactical incompetence.*

*Official army sources said the unit was holding its ground in heavy combat and that claims of problems inside the brigade were overblown. An officer from the 59th Motorized Infantry Brigade contacted by Kyiv Post said the same thing.*

*According to a Monday statement from Ukraine’s Army General Staff (AGS), a top-level Army Chief of Staff (ACS) evaluation team would “conduct checks” among staff serving with the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade to clarify “circumstances of recent losses of personnel.”*

*Since taking over command of the Ukrainian military in February 2024, Syrsky, a commander with a reputation for demanding discipline and strict enforcement of the chain of command from subordinates, has rarely made public possible internal problems in a combat unit.*

*A longstanding fighting formation with combat experience in the southern Kherson and eastern Donbas sectors, the 59th Brigade, according to open-source reports, is deployed to the west of the city of Donetsk, the site of a major Russian offensive aiming for the regional road hub of Pokrovsk.*

*The Monday morning Ukrainian army daily situation update identified the Pokrovsk sector as the single most kinetic sector of the entire fighting front, with 35 Russian attacks against Ukrainian positions in the past 24 hours. The battlefield situation was “tense” but Ukrainian forces were holding, that statement said.*

*The General Syrsky-signed announcement that the 59th Brigade, a key piece of the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s (AFU) defenses in Ukraine’s east, would be investigated followed one day after allegations by Kateryna Polishchuk, a high-profile volunteer medic and survivor of the 2022 Mariupol Siege, of possible leadership problems inside the unit.*

*In posts to Facebook and other social media, Polishchuk charged the 59th Brigade’s top officers with tactical incompetence and having been promoted thanks to nepotism.*

*Using terms like “lawlessness,” “thoughtless criminal orders,” and “completely unnecessary losses,” Polishchuk, an internet personality best known for her nickname “Ptashka” (Birdie) and bravery medals given her by President Volodymyr Zelensky, accused the 59th brigade commander of having ordered key senior personnel from the brigade staff to front lines to serve as infantrymen, where most were killed or wounded.*

*“A few weeks ago, on his direct order, almost the entire top intelligence of the brigade was sent to the advanced positions, absolutely without any need for it. As a result: the intelligence chief of the brigade – killed, the artillery chief of one of the attached battalions – killed, the chief sergeant of the intelligence company – killed, the commander of the intelligence company – wounded…by these actions the commanding general destroyed the entire intelligence management unit of the brigade,” Polishchuk claimed.*

*In a Sunday Facebook post, Polishchuk said the investigation should look into: “criminal orders, deliberate negligence, disregard for the life and health of personnel, actions that led to the deaths of a large number of military personnel, including those from high leadership positions, selfishness, blind careerism, the sacking of commanders “in disagreement”…(and)…inhumane and unprofessional attitude.” She went on to announce her group was ending ambulance and evacuation support to the brigade.*

*Other Ukrainian media widely covered the Russian offensive towards Pokrovsk and, like Polishchuk, identified the 59th Brigade commander by name and pointed to the town Krasnohorivka as the scene of a recent, bloody Ukrainian defeat purportedly caused by poor leadership.*

*Kyiv Post was unable to contact the officer for comment about the allegations made against him.*

*Elements of the 59th Brigade, in the first two weeks of July, were hit by repeated Russian attacks and lost control of most of Krasnohorivka – a tactically important town some 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk.*

*High-profile Ukrainian military correspondent Yury Butusov was one of the first to raise a red flag that the situation Krasnohorivka was deteriorating, reporting on July 2 that the 59th Brigade commander had been promoted too quickly because of nepotism, and that the Russian assault towards Pokrovsk caught him and his staff flat-footed.*

*“(The 59th Brigade commander) does not cope with his duties, battles are going on in the city, the enemy is advancing, and the complete loss of the city of Krasnohorivka is becoming real…The situation is critical, the enemy has an advantage, so let's improve at least what we can quickly change – the quality of management, the order and organization of our forces, Butusov wrote, calling on Syrsky to overhaul brigade leadership. There was no clear official response to the journalist’s public appeal.*

*The medic Polishchuk’s demand that Syrsky do something about alleged chaos in 59th Brigade’s senior command group, and purported heavy losses of ground in Krasnohorivka and defensive positions nearby, came nearly two weeks after Butusov’s report.*

*Polishchuk in other claims accused 59th Brigade leadership of launching recently recruited troops assigned to the unit to bloody and unsuccessful attempts to regain lost ground with counterattacks – although the soldiers had less than two months of training. Fighting the Russian army by micromanagement, without visiting the front line, is ineffective, Butusov charged.*

*Serhiy Tsekhotsky, an officer serving with the 59th for more than two years, in comments to Kyiv Post rejected those claims.*

*He said the brigade and Ukrainian defenses around it were not only holding their ground, but inflicting crushing damage on Russian personnel and combat equipment.*

*“We are cutting them to pieces,” Tsekhotsky said. “Their losses are massive.”*

*Tsekhotsky said that according to official brigade counts, over June, men and officers from the 59th claimed credit for the destruction of 2,969 Russian service personnel in battle. That figure is consistent with heavy Russian losses registered by independent observers, among them Iceland’s Ragnarr Gudmundsson.*

*Tsekhotsky told Kyiv Post the Syrsky-ordered inspection would find a combat-capable unit with a strong command staff and said the inspectors could conclude Polishchuk’s allegations against the brigade’s senior officers were personally motivated.*

*The Kremlin has called the capture of all of Ukraine’s Donetsk region a war aim and for more than eighteen months has gradually expanded control over the region using high casualty, but sometimes successful, infantry attacks, backed by artillery and air strikes.*

*According to Kremlin claims, Ukrainian forces elsewhere in the eastern sector lost ground with the Russian capture of the villages of Novoselivka Persha, Yasnobrodivka and Progress.*

*The independent military information platform DeepState confirmed the Ukrainian losses, however, Joint Forces Khortytsia, the Ukrainian army overall command headquarters in the eastern sector, claimed Ukrainian forces were holding at all those locations. A morning AGS situation estimate reported heavy fighting but no loss of ground.*

*A Monday UNIAN news agency report said that Russia’s heaviest assaults – usually a mix of infantry backed by artillery and air strikes – currently were targeting the village of Novooleksandrivka, some 25 kilometers (16 miles) to the east of Pokrovsk.*",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcXFYTmdoUWJoLTlQczdDRFdDcGpsNzRUcVdRSnFLWnRib3lmZ3ppc0xDU3pDS0tPLXo1OEJ1OENQeGZCeURwNHRNdnJCbEFUcDFNUUJXbVVkV19JR2c9PQ==

"It’s a transition ""issue"".
In German every heavily armored vehicle is classified as a tank (dt.

"He did a [long interview with NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/opinion/jd-vance-interview.html) last month which dived into where he stands on a swathe of issues. Admittedly I don't pay much attention to US domestic politics, but I was surprised that he articulated his (populist) positions with a minimum of bullshit. He seems pretty well-spoken. Whether you agree with his positions is a different story, of course.

Of particular interest to this audience is probably his comments on Ukraine. 

> *Ukraine.*

> Yeah.

> *In the opinion piece you wrote for us, you were very critical of the aid that we were giving to Ukraine. But at the end of the piece, you seemed open to the idea of supporting Ukraine in a defensive posture.
From a certain perspective, that is what the Biden administration has done. Yes, they supported two Ukrainian counteroffensives, one of which went well and one of which did not. But relative to more hawkish voices, including in your own party, they have tried to avoid direct confrontation with Russia. So I’m curious what you think has been so wrong with their strategy. I know you think we shouldn’t have encouraged the recent counteroffensive——*

> That’s the most important divergence between me and the Biden administration. I thought the counteroffensive would be a disaster, that we were motivated by moralism and not enough by strategic thinking. The Russians had really adjusted in a lot of profound ways. It was extremely obvious, when you talked to our military leadership in classified settings, they were exceedingly skeptical that the Ukrainians would achieve any strategic breakthrough. OK, why are we doing this then?

> *Is there a more minimalist J.D. Vance plan that would involve limited defensive support for Ukraine as part of a path to armistice?*

> What I would like to do, and what I think fundamentally is achievable here with American leadership — but you never know till you have the conversation — is you freeze the territorial lines somewhere close to where they are right now. That’s No. 1. No. 2 is you guarantee both Kyiv’s independence but also its neutrality. It’s the fundamental thing the Russians have asked from the beginning. I’m not naïve here. I think the Russians have asked for a lot of things dishonestly, but neutrality is clearly something that they see as existential for them. And then three, there’s going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term. I think those three things are certainly achievable, yes.

> *The critique of you and everyone else who opposed the recent appropriation was that if you can’t demonstrate a durable commitment to Ukraine, then Russia doesn’t have any incentive to make peace. If the Russians think they’re winning, how do you give Putin an incentive to make a deal if you’re cutting funding?*

> The leverage that we have over the Russians is not, in my view, that we can indefinitely keep the Ukrainians in a successful defensive posture. Let me be clear about this: There is no way with our capacity and what Russia has been doing that we can hold off the Russians indefinitely.
There are two big points of leverage that we have. One, they could take over Ukraine, but they can’t govern Ukraine. We’re talking about multiple hundreds of thousands of troops to govern the country effectively as a Russian subsidiary. The second point of leverage that we have is a war economy has its own internal momentum. They’re now at 7 percent of G.D.P. being spent on defense. They have re-engineered an economy around fighting a war instead of around improving the lives of your people. That has some real problems over the long term.
By the way, it’s not in our interest, either, for the Russians to have a war economy for the next five years, because then they’re going to be more militaristic and aggressive than they otherwise would be.

> *You agree it’s not in our interest right now for the Russians to roll through the rest of Ukraine?*

> No, it is not in our interest.

There is much more to the interview, mostly domestic issues, but also a bit on broader foreign policy.

> *How would you describe your foreign policy perspective?*

> Not as “Putin first,” as maybe your readers would say ——

> *I asked how you would describe it.*

> I’m very self-aware, Ross. Many flaws, that’s not one of them. The term “realist” gets thrown around a lot, and I’d say there are three pillars to realism in the 21st century: The first is that moralisms about “This country is good,” “This country is bad” are largely useless, and we should be dealing with other countries based on whether they’re good or bad for America’s interests. That doesn’t mean you have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you’re dealing with, and there’s a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country.

> No. 2 is the most important lesson of World War II, that we seem to have forgotten: that military power is downstream of industrial power. We are still, right now, the world’s military superpower, largely because of our industrial might from the ’80s and ’90s. But China is a more powerful country industrially than we are, which means they will have a more powerful military in 20 years.

> And No. 3 is acknowledging that we’re in a multipolar world, and we need allies to step up in big ways so that we can focus on East Asia, which is where our most significant competitor is for the next 20 or 30 years.

> *Should we defend Taiwan if it’s attacked?*

> Our policy effectively is one of strategic ambiguity. I think that we should make it as hard as possible for China to take Taiwan in the first place, and the honest answer is we’ll figure out what we do if they attack. The thing that we can control now is making it costly for them to invade Taiwan, and we’re not doing that because we’re sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine and not Taiwan.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVGFidDY5Z2tsajFRQ1kwSnkweEZqOFBYN2FlalNjSElhVWZqT2xLTG44OVZOT2xfVWM1LWVoaGgxOUg5WmQ1MGZjMzJ4VEpfaHdWaGRlZEJrVTk1Vk9aSE9sVmxLWWRhbEY5RER0U2pRU009

I think it's a fair guess to say the DoD estimate is likely to be more accurate than something you'd find in the public sphere.  They have access to a lot of infrastructure that captures a lot of information.

For example they may know about quantities of exports of specific industrial materials to Russia year to year that may be used in artillery shell production. Maybe another data point about satellite measurements of carbon emissions over known military production sites. etc

Take a number of these different data points and grab a few strong data scientists and statisticians and you can piece together a fairly accurate estimate.

"There are simply not enough replies to you that are correct in the sense of giving the reason why, and instead trying to relate it to previous examples that are not relevant. It has nothing to do with WW1 tactics. 

It’s loitering drones that are spotters being used in the tens of thousands daily at the zero line. (Long line, but still reports are that you can’t go more than 5-10 minutes without being aware of one)

It has been the case since at least the Battle of Bakmut, and increasingly since, that as the number of loitering drones and availability of FPV ‘fires’ that anything moving from the rear to the zero line is immediately detected during the day time. More recently the same is occurring at night as the drones are more general coming with thermal optics. 

In this manner, it is impossible for either side to achieve any effective mass at the zero line. The objective of sending smaller assaults is that  A). It makes it less likely they will get smoked by ordnance before they even begin the assault. B) dispersed assaults are creating a longer and more intense combat cycle for the defenders who repel slightly lower-intensity attacks 30 times a day rather than one or two attacks a day that are met with a wall of artillery.

In summary: the assaults are at the largest size they can be, and when they try larger assaults the troop movement is smoked before it arrives. In Russia’s case, the main deterrent which is combat losses isn’t even a human concern as much as a mathematical one, so the downside of the ground-beef waves isn’t even really a factor for command.

Ukrainian forces are having trouble even rotating at the skeleton crew level the zero line is at already. The most dangerous times for them, according the the recent comments I’ve seen at least, is during the rotations that happen at night because fewer and fewer drones come without thermals.

I keep beating this horse with ‘drone aspect of the zero-line’ but I will restate it one last time because there was even a post of a legionnaire recently telling people to stop volunteering without knowledge about drones, how they work and how to fix them.

"He's aligned with the supposed Trump plan, but neither of them really make sense and hinge on huge leaps.

Getting Russia to the table: In the Trump plan, this is supposed to occur by surging weapons to Ukraine if Russia advances or doesn't negotiate, but delivering no more aid when Ukraine has too strong a position. According to Vance, Russia will come to the table because of economic concerns.

Russia has proven itself to be completely fine with sitting the West out while losing hundreds of thousands. If Trump forces Ukraine to fight in predictable waves, especially short lived ones, the Russians likely won't mind waiting the West out some more on this. The West has expected Russia to reconsider due to economic concerns a million times by now, but it never happened.

Neutrality for Ukraine: How is Ukraine neutral, but under US protection? The Russians will simply look at Japan or South Korea to realise that even a neutral country with a strong American troop presence won't stay factually neutral. Ukraine, on the other hand, will see an administration declaring ""rationality"", a pivot to Asia and ""no defense for freeloaders"". Why should they believe that the US will make a long term exception in their specific case?

Just claiming to be a realist while making major assumptions that habe no basis in reality isn't a foreign policy. The unfortunate truth is: We've seen this type of deal play out, as designed by the great ""deal maker"" himself. The Afghanistan treaty Trump brokered was an unmitigated desaster, as was his decision to withdraw from the Iran accord. But as long as he gets to claim victory, which his base will believe no matter what, he's fine with any outcome.

"I was just circling back to this to check my analysis given subsequent events, and noticed I missed your comment back when this post was live, but felt it was worth pointing a couple things out. I think there was a critical piece of information that you were missing because I did not state it explicitly. Specifically, the mind boggling quantity of that captured Russian equipment I mentioned.

> 488+ donated Soviet-variant tanks versus around 477 lost. Plus captured Russian equipment

By the last few months of the Battle of Bakhmut, the Ukrainians had captured *more than 500* Russian tanks, mostly during the Russian retreat from Kyiv and the Kharkiv counteroffensive. That's why I took the point as fairly well substantiated, I felt that the 500+ buffer from captured equipment was more than enough to cover any under reporting. Even if Oryx only captured 50% of total losses, the Ukrainians would have had almost exactly the same number of Soviet-derived tanks available as they started the war with around that time. And that estimate would also assume none of the losses documented on Oryx were repairable, which seems unlikely, especially in light of evidence from recent months that suggests the Ukrainians actually have an extremely robust recovery and repair system for their T- variant tanks.

I also do not think that armor availability was a fundamental premise for any of the arguments I made really. I meant it merely as a smaller bit of evidence forming part of a larger, more complete picture of the broader economy of force issues at play. My primary point was that the Ukrainians did not allocate much armor to the front around Bakhmut at all, despite the reports of extremely challenging conditions, suggesting either an extreme deficit in equipment, an intentional economy of force strategy to minimally resource the defense, or both. Given the huge quantity of new brigades they stood up over the past two years, it's not surprising that armor is starting to be spread pretty thin now, but that doesn't mean there is *no* armor. In fact, there's roughly the same amount of armor, just spread across a larger overall force. So the absence of AFVs in Bakhmut reflected an intentional economy of force decision, rather than purely an equipment shortage. 

Just because there are not enough AFVs to equip new brigades doesn't mean there aren't AFVs available at all, so even if there were equipment shortages, the decision not to allocate the limited quantity available still constituted a decision to reserve whatever AFVs they did have for other purposes. That in turn suggests that they were not blindly wasting resources on holding the city at any cost. Clearly they decided holding Bakhmut was not worth losing any of their higher quality kit at all. Instead, a lot of the better legacy kit was held back for the new assault brigades (meaning the AB-designated units like the 3rd AB, not the larger offensive corps composed of brigades equipped with western kit), with the remainder concentrated in mechanized or tank brigades functioning as division-level active defense reserves anchoring a sector of the front. 

Ultimately, we won't really know whether it was worth fighting for Bakhmut so hard for many years to come, when sufficient evidence has been declassified to assess the costs in terms of the actual Ukrainian and Russian casualties suffered, equipment destroyed, and supplies expended. Then, we will be able to evaluate the information available on the ground at that time to the relevant military and civilian decision-makers. At which time, we can perhaps come to some conclusions about whether it was the right choice and whether the results were positive for Ukraine. Which aren't necessarily the same thing. One can be true without the other: a bad choice can have a good result and vice versa. 

But that said, I do think the decision to keep fighting was ultimately the correct one at the time. The UAF leadership made a difficult, politically unpalatable decision to sacrifice units that were never going to be useful in an offensive to burn through low quality Russian troops (primarily prisoners in StormZ battalions) that would have been far more useful on the defensive than they were offensively in meatwave assaults. Low quality light infantry are universally much more able to hold their own trenches than they are to conduct assaults squarely into the teeth of enemy trenches. Unfortunately, despite whatever attrition the Russians suffered around Bakhmut, they still had enough reserves to hold the line against the counteroffensive, albeit when protected by a deeply layered trench system, extensive EW capabilities, vast yet incredibly dense minefields, and Ka-52 attack helicopters capable of outranging any UAF tactical anti-air asset while picking off their tanks and IFVs from the comparative safety of their own operational rear, a comfortable 12km behind the lines.

Without the ability to overcome those threats, the quality and quantity of Russian reserves simply did not become decisive factors in frustrating the Ukrainian offensive. However, StormZ and other similar light infantry were at times decisive during the later stages of the counteroffensive, with front line StormZ units sometimes creating sufficient delay to enable elite VDV units prosecuting an elastic defense to counterattack against and frustrate a Ukrainian assault. Meaning it did benefit the Ukrainians that there were fewer low quality meatwave type units available during the counteroffensive, because more such units may have prevented even the limited progress that they did make. The ultimate question is whether that benefit was worth the price paid. Or at least whether the potential benefit made it a reasonable bet for the UAF leadership to take, given what they knew at the time.

So what's the price paid? Critics of the decision to hold in Bakhmut typically claim that the ammo expended and experienced troops lost compromised the subsequent counteroffensive. Yet when you look at the Ukrainian units involved in the battle from December 2022 until the Russian victory in May 2023, only the 3rd Assault Brigade would have conceivably participated in any offensive, so only its losses really would have detracted from the forces available for the counteroffensive. Yet it did not experience particularly heavy losses during the defense of Bakhmut at all. Quite the opposite, the unit remained so combat effective that they were able to make impressive gains conducting spoiling attacks against the Russians in the suburbs around the city during the counteroffensive. Which they accomplished despite being equipped with some really old legacy western kit like YPR-765s. That means the 3rd AB would not have been one of the tip of the spear units like the 47th OMB with its Bradleys. Yet it was those heavily armored and mechanized tip of the spear units which were not able to break through with breaching assaults during the counteroffensive. Suggesting that a more lightly equipped unit like the 3rd AB would have made no difference to the operations in the south anyway. I certainly think it's fair to at least say that its absence or casualties can't be the explanation for the counteroffensive's failure.

There are also no suggestions that ammunition shortages doomed the counteroffensive. Although ammo shortages occurred well after the initial failed breaching assaults, those shortages were used to justify DPICMs donations and there was no meaningful disruption in Ukrainian artillery fires. At least not until many months later after the complications around the US aid package cropped up. Thus it does not seem that the ammunition expended in Bakhmut detracted from the counteroffensive at all, which in fact saw the Ukrainians establish artillery superiority over the Russians for the first time since the war began.

In the end, only history will tell.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndzRjMlptZW1KOUdpMlNxM29ZS1Nhb1owQ0dRVjlZUVRNSnlvRUs1Q292SUU4R25DelJYcGtVYkNDdXJyOTBOeFVBYWhwXzQwbUplWm1MN3pqTE16c1E9PQ==

This is a massive, massive leap.  For example, the current attrition heavy warfare, which has greatly depleted Russia's cold war and post cold war stock of AFVs, is making it so that Russia is less and less likely to be able to invade any other major country (including a future reprise in Ukraine) anytime in the next several decades.

">Thousands: yes, tens of thousands: no. That would be something like a drone every ~10-20m of the front.

I think you’re likely more right than wrong and I am on the higher end of imagination but I also think the real figure would surprise you if you are conservative about it.

Someone did the math about a previously posted Ukrainian front line experience that described a 5-15 minute windows as a largest time they really went without a drone being within visual or audio confirmable. I imagine that was a very hot area, but again the front line is the entire east side of a Country. They ended up with 10s of thousands of drones being rolled out a day for that to be possible, which was them including both sides and I think a Mavik equivalent flight time. 

According to many sources, but the quickest and the shittiest and most googlable first, Ukraine is fielding about 50k per month in FPV fire-equivalent drones since at least Avdivka in Feb/March. Noting that there are at least 3 times as many reconnaissance type, and the less known but assuredly larger Russian amount of both as well as the larger and more sturdy types available. 

In the few months since then, the number and quality of drones has continued to climb almost like the aviation numbers did when the US entered the war in ww2. It’s clear it’s going to go up even more and that there is no need to be afraid of it slowing the trajectory down.

> they need 10+ drones to do a rotation on the same spot

For this part, you’re actually wrong though. They do need 10+ drones to do a rotation on the same spot because each drone has finite uptime and they need virtually constant uptime at the front because of the nature of the relentless small wave assaults. Any infantry without drone awareness is as good as dead. There aren’t 10s of thousands in the air at the same time, but they are mixed and staggered throughout the day and night.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSDByNFk5a20xbDh4TDZvRDhqVFV2cVpjQ3NvaWdsSkU0enFKTEZaUTRoYnlTdWl5LVppMWpGd09icnEwR1c0aldQWlNhamFSYTc2N1J1NEdBZGlSdXc9PQ==
"yes and Europe realized it by now after decades of friendly relationship with Russia.   
i'm pretty sure Trump didn't and doesn't care about Europe security, he only made this a big topic to score domestically. The administrations before him also called out Germany/Europe for doing too less/nordstream etc etc. Maybe if the US wouldn't have started illegal wars which led to a few hundred k civilian casualties and dead European soldiers, someone would have listened.

"I think a decisive Ukrainian victory makes such a scenario very likely though. Such a victory means moving the NATO border east by a considerable margin, with a likely revanchist Russia angling for a lot of NATO territory. That's a recipe for conflict. I would argue the best case scenario in terms of avoiding such a situation would be a frozen conflict after the Russian Soviet stockpiles have been further attrited. We'd have good reason not to admit Ukraine into NATO in such a scenario, Russia would be less likely to engage in revanchism and we'd have a solid buffer should a conflict break out again.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnX0JCcktudEZKQUNmZFFadUdna1N5eWtwTzBrRWc3U2NnOWZTUjVYN0RkRGEtUE9KY3k0RzlKRTk5cEJ0WnFjNHRQaUpsb1MtTGVwdHBlRmlQMHJHVGc9PQ==
"Nah, Vance was picked because he resonates with the MAGA voter base, is media savvy, relatively smart, and young enough to take over the reigns as the party leader once Trump finishes his term.

I don't get the impression that Ukraine is a core priority for Trump. Which may actually end up being part of the problem when it comes time to negotiate with Putin -- It could be similar to the Afghanistan negotiations, where he didn't really care about the geopolitical implications of the agreement as much as he did about saying he struck a deal, some deal, any deal, thus ""solving"" the problem.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnN1FUVnJ2ZWV2dm43amJOa0FRWUFDZ01pVk5tRmlZZjh4SEJVMzNpVmJKNXF1UWxfSEF1R1JWYXhrdzNBYlNsQ3VCU010MWNSY3gxR2N3QURZR2hTbmc9PQ==
"I find many of these points not self evident at all, they are at best possibilities, in particular wether a further war is guaranteed is pure speculation, most expert warning of this simultaneously qualify it on the absence of NATO reaction to small provocations and not full blown war at all, so in fact it is largely independent of the outcome in Ukraine while assuming basically the US and another major NATO countries choosing to ignore Russian provocations against members.

">Why would the US be best served by a hypothetical decisive Ukrainian victory?

It will show potential aggressors in other parts of the world that America can fund a winnable war against them. It can put worries inside the CCP circles like: "" No matter how long it took,America just threw equipments to Ukraine and they've won the war against Russia. We thought they'll give up on them. So maybe they're actually serious in defending Taiwan too.""

America has the big stick so they can talk softly. If they're afraid of using it due to being bloodied, give it to the people fighting the Russians so they can beat them and humiliate them. Make Russia an example of what happens if you defy American world order. China and Iran wouldn't fall in line by being soft or playing the ""were avoiding escalations"" card. They'll fall in line if you use your strength, not just being contend with showing it. 

By falling in line, I mean, not being aggressive or they'll dial it down.",r/credibledefense,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnVUtQSWMwRjRLU0tmSDM0MVFuTl9hN3JnQldBNTlnNFZ4UFJ2a2RBYTdZNDk2VE9tOHpTaVJJdzZtNGtZWFI2U05zanZHMVZhb2gxbDdTSFZUQnVhZkE9PQ==
"Some are still taking the administrations to be more naive than they should ever get credit for. That is apart from the fact it doesn't really fit with the no-escalation talk that, with markedly different viewpoints, has been part and parcel of this subreddit just about every day. If your greatest worry and purpose is preventing some kind of ""escalation"", and for better or worse you're acting like it, then you're not having your head in the sand. Maybe there are the wrong heads in offices, at the wrong time. But this is something very different. To be clear, I wouldn't just deem Washington and Berlin in particular indifferent or oblivious: they are wrong, terribly, historically wrong and have been from the first day on. And they're not making bones about their priorities, which is about the oddest thing to me: are people just not listening?

Washington and Berlin in particular do not want Putin to fail. Presumably in part because they're convinced Russia would fail. (I can think of further reasons though.) If one wouldn't believe this now, in spite of the objective realities of the--arguably regained--stability of Putin's regime alone, there's nothing else to do. At the same time of course no one wants Ukraine to fail either, or perhaps I should say more cautiously ""can afford"" to let this happen. But frankly I think this is more about prestige, global posturing, and reluctant consideration for allies in northern and eastern Europe than about (true) sympathies towards Kyiv. Either way the upshot of such schizophrenia being what we see, and hardly surprising so: a complete disaster.

I fully support what another user said about ""all in, or all out"". Eating your cake and having it too won't do. More specifically, and aware of what all out would entail, I for one was always opting for all in. But to me that is intervention and could only be. Not ""add this or that munition to the aid package and see what happens"". There were not many besides me. ;) And now guess what, it's too late. It's spilled milk and we'll have to see what another US leadership can possibly make of it. Wouldn't even have to be worse than the disaster left behind by those who came before, and there goes another ultra-cheap win for the hard and populist right, a poacher's goal even; *that* too stopped surprising me some time ago.

Just one more thing, for those who missed the missing invitation at the latest summit: even (social-democratic) Berlin and (democratic) Washington are actively striving, lobbying *against* Ukrainian NATO membership, already! So at least for that it doesn't need Trump/Vance, and if this is what Russia wants (it is) these three parties might as well be talking by this time. Again, wouldn't be surprised if deep down they had already hoped for some kind of change of power, not in Moscow, but *in Kyiv* rather.
