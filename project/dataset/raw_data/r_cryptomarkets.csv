"whiteboardcrypto for basic terms.

coinmarketcap is your crypto tracker. Nothing in crypto is as straightforward and simple as a brokerage account.

Bianance offers a person plenty to choose from already. Trying to get stuff on a dex and then where to put it is a mountain of added complexity. Stick to the shallow waters yet. There are plenty of great projects on binance to make you a boatload of money without jumping into the total degeneracy of micro-cap tokens and especially stupid meme coins.

"My question concerns Coinbase Pro and Coinbase…. I had bought crypto on Coinbase Pro, which was eventually migrated to Coinbase.   Apparently, when they did this, they adjusted the cost basis…. which was substantially lower than my buy price.   Now, my account shows much larger gains than what they “ should” be, meaning that I will pay a much greater tax bill when I sell. Since I haven’t yet sold any of my crypto, I wonder if Coinbase will also collect higher fees from me.

I actually am down from my buy price but because of their adjustment of my cost basis, my account shows a large profit.   This seems like it should be illegal.  

What recourse do I have when I sell??",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbV90OEJxd0ZJbVI1eVFxdFBjaWI1MWxoVmFCRWNxYUszZlp4ZXpHU3BzR1RrQTIzVmRBU1VueVA1ZFdfNWF0cDE5MTBoTkp3a25LSDVxX0lVZkJ2Y1E9PQ==

"For BTC, I'm still really bullish long-term. Despite the recent ups and downs, I think Bitcoin's value as a decentralized digital currency will only increase as adoption grows. You can read from the current news and events that governments and institutions are gradually accepting BTC. So it is easy to say that basic supply and demand makes me think BTC could hit six figures in the next 5-10 years.

With ETH, I'm a huge believer in the potential of smart contracts and dApps, which Ethereum is leading. The upcoming upgrades for better scalability and sustainability have me really excited. The DeFi and NFT projects built on Ethereum are still really early too. If they can pass regulations, the use cases seem endless. I could see ETH outpacing BTC's price growth if it cements itself as the base layer for Web3 applications.

Historically BTC and ETH have been pretty correlated, with BTC driving overall market movements. But as crypto matures, ETH could decouple more and move independently based on its adoption. This is just my opinion.

Still, do your research, but I have been using Traders Union for reading technical predictions. Their edge is they have true experts analyzing BTC and ETH price predictions.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUaUNmSzhyeVVvOWZyV09OWmhGVDE4TlJuT2NyYkVoTTBnLTRjcEJJQmJnd1BRMGx3VWFxR3ZrcEtWNEZnR2FRdTJNd244QWZFd25XNGhHVXQ0QmYxamc9PQ==

"You don’t need any advice from any “crypto influencers” that happen to share your view of the world, it’s as simple as finding those that are out there looking into different alternatives coins and presenting a use case. Then you watch their synopsis of each crypto and make a quick decision for yourself whether it’s worth learning about any further or whether or not the project clashes with what you believe the future will look like. 

Like yourself, I despise the idea of a social credit system, and I want to limit governmental overreach as much as possible. I gravitated to projects like Bitcoin and Kaspa because they are both decentralized (no one entity can control them) and they are the only assets that I have that no government / bad actor could ever take from me if I did not want them to be taken. There is incredible power in that, especially if our governments take a turn in the authoritarian direction you and I are predicting. 

I do not need a guru that happens to believe the same way to tell me what makes a good investment then. I simply look for crypto content about new projects and ask myself “what utility does this offer the world?”, “could it be done just as well without using cryptography?”, and “is this project decentralized?” (Which is in my opinion the whole strong use case for technologies like the blockchain).

"Try USDC. They've been open about their reserve backing and do monthly attestations from top accounting firms. The downside is it's still heavily USD-based, so not a perfect hedge if you're worried about the greenback going down.

Another good option is DAI, which is a bit different since it’s a decentralized stablecoin. It is backed by a mix of other crypto rather than fiat money and it is managed by the MakerDAO community. The code is open source and there's no central issuer, so it avoids a lot of the centralization risks. The downside is the complexity of the system and it can be unstable during extreme volatility.

There is also BUSD. Like USDC, it’s backed by US dollars held in FDIC-insured American banks. Also, it's issued by Paxos in partnership with Binance and is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.

Just a piece of advice, when I am figuring out which stablecoin to use, I spend a lot of time on the Traders Union.

"You can buy some ETH, withdraw it to your own wallet maybe to like Arbitrum, OP, or Base chain (eth L2 chains are way cheaper to use)

Then swap 80% of the ETH for wstETH (wrapped staked ETH from Lido protocol, it’s just an index of ETH+staking yield)

Then create a liquidity position at uniswap where you pair the wstETH with ETH. Set the price range of your position tight around the current spot price. No more than 2% above and 0.5% below. 

This sort of liquidity position should require about an 80:20 split of wstETH:ETH. This is what you want so that as the index price of wstETH rises thanks to the stake yield, your liquidity is facilitating the swapping of wstETH into ETH. 

Over the course of about 3-5 month your entire position should shift 100% into ETH until the price of wstETH is outside the upper limit of your range.  

By doing this you will not only earn the staking yield from staked ETH but also the trading fees from traders swapping in and out of staked ETH. 

On top of that you will also earn incentives payed by Lido for that liquidity. Those are payed in wstETH and added to the other forms of yield this strategies bears.  Currently the incentives are about 26% Apr while the LP pays close to 8% in fees and staking yield is about 4%. 

So if your following along this is a way to generate about 32% Apr in ETH on a position that is exclusively exposed to ETH price action.

All you need to do is claim the rewards and when your pool falls out of range, withdraw it and buy more wstETH with the ETH and then remake the pool with  a new range.  Incentives are distributed by Merkl and just need to be claimed. You can manage such a strategy with as little as one interaction per quarter.

"What I have learned about alpha, real true alpha is that it's pretty rare to find on your own and there's rare, specific conditions where someone will share it with you.

Usually the size of an alpha is too small for a large account to share and accomodate lots of traders. So someone like Miles for example who has a large portfolio and also lot's of discord members won't usually have enough alpha to go around. He'll synthesize some research for you and that's what you are paying for.

If he was willing to not fully exploite a real alpha just for himself either bec the size of the opportunity was large enough for many or bec he felt responsible bec of the paid group fee, and to share with the group you would see the opportunity get pumped en masse through the rush to get in.

A small account is more likely to share alpha. Why? Because they don't have enough money to fully exploite it when they find it and take on so much risk. Also, they're less confident because they haven't made it yet and want other people's confirmation and validation.
So there's a window of opportunity where they got in to something and there's still opportunity for others to follow them in before it blows up to the public.


I'm speaking from direct experience. I called a specific token that I tracked for months. It's now blowing up and I didn't fully exploite the alpha for myself, I shared it for some of the reasons above

That said some of those large discords are good for when sentiment gets extreme if for example they encourage you to have the guts to bet on safe investments like high caps, Btc, eth sol etc when if you were on your own you wld be panicking. Last year if someone was encouraging you to bet on Btc etc then they may deserve to be listened to. Personally I don't participate in those groups myself. 

I am in some small telegrams with friends which also has it's downsides. Bec yes, there's occasionally alpha shared but people also engage in ""alpha share load balancing"" I just made this up... basically what I mean is they feel like I made you money on some particular opportunity, so I have the right to shill you into supporting my other bags.... people have an equation in their minds regarding their give and take with you that never matches your own perspective on your position in the relationship.

So you can always lose money. Ultimately, trust nobody. Do your due diligence in everything. If you strike gold, hit it hard.

"I feel like you answered your own question.

It's unpredictable.

Therefore you're just betting on a line going up or down largely at random, if not technically random, then at least in a way that can't be predicted.  

So, it's a bit like betting on the spin of a wheel.  

If you're making money it's presumably because you've caught a rising market.  And probably would have made a better return just by buying and holding.  

The fees alone make this very hard to make a profit, even if you make the right bets.

Hey, I've been there.  It took me a lot of time and effort to realise that the same time and effort could be spent on doing something that actually gives me a  return.  You know, like working on my career.  

It's funny how much work people put into this only to make very meagre returns.

I used to do affiliate marketing sites in my spare time and would happily make 10k a year doing bullshit blogposts a few evenings a week.  If you're not beating that then why waste your time.

Maybe if you have large starting capital it's easier to get meaningful wins.

But if I had a £1m to invest I'd just put it somewhere safe and enjoy the £50k interest it paid me each year.  No need to be greedy.  For every winner there are many losers and I can't risk losing my money - I worked too hard for it.

"Crypto is only about the price you buy and the price you sell.  Any given coin doesn't necessarily generate wealth over time so doesn't necessarily go up in value.

By right asset, do you mean a wealth generating asset?  Because then time does matter.  Time means more wealth.

Bitcoins price is a function of buyer interest.  That can go up in time.  It can go down in time.  The only thing that matters is selling when there is high interest and you can never know when that peak is.  We hope it's in the future.  But it could already be in the past.

This is fundamentally different to a wealth generating asset.  I bought a stock ten years ago that pays me ten percent.  So I already have my money back.  I will patiently accept the continued payouts for the rest of my life.  Until I die or the company does.

"Your £4.8k profit might feel small over two years, but honestly, any profit is better than losses. Playing it safe can seem slow, but it does have its perks. Over the years, I’ve found that spreading out investments and not going all-in on one coin helps balance the risk. 

Dumping a load into Bitcoin and coming back in 5 years sounds like a good plan for me. BTC’s long-term growth has been pretty good, and it’s less risky compared to newer, more volatile coins. But before you go all in, I’d suggest checking out some resources to improve your strategy. The Traders Union page has always been a lifesaver for me. They’ve got tons of info on how to make smarter trades and avoid common mistakes, which has helped me avoid some costly errors. Plus, Traders Union reviews on different brokers can save you from pump-and-dump hype. It’s like having a free guide for crypto trading.

Another thing I’ve learned is to take profits along the way. Don’t wait for the ultimate high. If you see a decent gain, take some off the table.

You can check out projects(SightAI) with new tech integrations(FHE) within AI, they are using verifiable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to enable secure AI computations on encrypted data.

Solana chain has been gaining traction, so keep some in SOL and related projects like Raydium(dex), Picasso(earn rewards via restaking).

* using SWIFT (Bank Frick)

Outside EU you can still transfer for free using Etana Custody but then minimum is 150 USD/GBP. I don't know much about this option and whether it's paid or not though.

"I would first encourage you to think of alt coins as not one big entity, but instead as a variety of types of assets. 

As an example, meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Dogwifhat - people like to buy into them because they happen to be popular at this exact moment and not because they have any actual utility. 

On the other hand, coins like Kaspa, Render, Solana, etc. actually have technology behind them that could change the way cryptocurrencies integrate into our daily lives.

"-Don't invest money you might need in the next 6-12 months. -Don't panic sell.
-Don't go into debt to invest. (Don't over-leverage or over-expose yourself either) 
-Don't invest all your money at once so that way you always have cash to take advantage of any surprise dips/buying opportunities. 
-Some say don't be emotional but you can actually use emotions to your advantage if you're smart. For example, take some profits when you are ecstatic about how much your portfolio is up. 
-Be consistent and have an actual strategy. Dollar cost averaging can be good for newbs to build initial positions. 
-Always think long term and don't treat crypto as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. 

If you plan to be alive in 10 years from now, why wouldn't you want to be holding some crypto? The long term holders are the ones who end up really making it big. Everyone wishes they had bought Bitcoin 12 years ago but in reality most of those people would have sold it all at some point along the way. The people who have held all this time are now the bitcoin ""whales."" I'm not saying don't ever take profits but you should dedicate a portion of your portfolio for long term hodl-ing. That way you can make money over the short/mid-term and the long-term time frames.

Just because there have been “cycles” of 4 years in the past and just because people see that as a pattern that doesn’t mean the pattern will repeat. There is only a cycle when the cycle repeats and there is no guarantee of that. The past doesn’t guarantee anything. Maybe there will be a bull run this year or maybe the bull run will be drawn out over3  4  5 or more years like the regular stock markets.

"#CBDC Pro-Arguments
Below is a CBDC pro-argument written by cryotosensei.

> The typical retail investor may assume that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a high-brow concept that is still in the conceptualisation stage and will only take effect in the future. However, according to Atlantic Council, ten countries have fully launched CBDCs, the most prominent of which has to be the digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, that was launched in China and continues to make superb inroads into consumers’ payment habits. The IMF also noted in a speech in February 2022 that about 100 countries are currently exploring CBDCs in one way or another. Hence, CBDCs may well become as ubiquitous as fiat currency. Just what are the advantages of CBDCs? 
> 
> 1. CBDCs are backed by the central bank, so they are recognized as legal tender and can be used as a payment app. Besides the peace of mind afforded to citizens, CBDCs come in handy during periods of economic downturns because central banks can deploy them quickly to give out stimulus checks to the lowest-income groups who need government handouts the most. 
> 2. CBDCs are distributed through commercial banks. This alleviates the problem of too much disruption to the financial system. 
> 3. CBDCs help unbanked populations get access to money and be included in their nation’s financial systems. Take for instance Jamaica, in which 17% of the population are unbanked. Since mobile phone use in Jamaica is pervasive, the authorities’ launch of a CBDC called Jam-Dex will help unbanked Jamaicans get paid electronically since they can access it via a banking app on their phones. The same can be said of the Bahamas, which launched the Sand Dollar in October 2020 to reach out to its unbanked population.
> 4. CBDCs provide cost savings. One reason why Jamaica piloted its Jam-Dex program in the first place was the substantial cost (more than $7 million) incurred in replacing dollar notes of all kinds. Removing all transaction costs problems associated with cash will thus save government agencies and business enterprises money.
> 5. CBDCs bolster resilience to the domestic payments market. In China, AliPay and TenPay/WeChat Pay dominate the mobile payments market. Should the private enterprises governing these mobile payments suffer a huge hit to their vitality, the repercussions on the mobile payments system could be far-reaching (and aggravated if there are no safety nets in place). The incorporation of the e-CNY was  aimed to act as a backup to AliPay and TenPay/WeChat Pay.
> 6. CBDCs facilitate cross-border remittances at a low cost. Cambodia launched its CBDC, Bakong, in October 2020. Since many Cambodians work overseas in Malaysia, the National Bank of Cambodia collaborated with Malaysian commercial bank, Malayan Banking so that Cambodian migrant workers in Malaysia could send money to their loved ones without hassle.
> 7. CBDCs act as a safeguard against the illicit use of money. The Bahamas did not have a robust Anti-Money Laundering/Combating Financing of Terrorism framework and was flagged out to undergo extra monitoring under the Financial Action Task Force list in 2018. Following its introduction of the Sand Dollar, the Bahamas was taken off the list in December 2020. 
> 8. CBDCs is a safer option compared to stablecoins, which are largely unregulated and pose risks to the financial system. The recent collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin, UST underscores this point. 
> 9. CBDCs ensure monetary sovereignty. Particularly, the United States would be concerned if global citizens start adopting a stablecoin or a foreign CBDC en masse, thus leading to the possibility that the U.S. dollar might not remain the world’s favored payment mechanism. This explains why President Joe Biden signed an executive order in March 2022 that focused on the exploration of a U.S. CBDC.

"Have you developed on it? I have. You can write smart contracts in python if you want but it has to be transpiled into Plutus, so you have to write your contracts like Haskell just with a python syntax. Also because it's UTXO unlike every other smart contract chain (account based) you have to learn a completely new approach to contract design with a tiny fraction of the developer tooling and information. It's not the language it's the entire development process and knowledge requirement, why would you possibly want to learn the one smart contract language/system that doesn't work anywhere else? They literally build people's contracts for them with foundation money because nobody knows how to use it, I have worked with the team that does it, it sucked.

 Is that educated enough for you? 

'woah token went up! Must be good token with utility. Ooga booga'

If your chain doesn't work with the major dev tooling and infrastructure providers, all of which target account-based EVM chains - nobody can or wants to build on it. For every 1000 dev teams building for the EVM, there's like 1 building on cardano - so there's 1/1000th of the cool products, so there's no liquidity, so nobody wants to build for it, so there's no products etc etc etc

They're permanently promising proper evm support but it never seems to actually arrive. I've seen probably 5 different attempts get announced. The latest is Milkomeda that might or might not make it more attractive but I'm not holding my breath. They get about 5k transactions per day, and cardano total transactions iis like 50k. Ethereum gets over a million. solana (which is also dislike for another reason) gets 10s of millions. These are not good numbers for the cardano evm.

Some time soon chains and tokens are going to have to actually serve a purpose or they'll die - at the moment crypto prices are pretty much 100% speculation which is why PEPE has a 2.3B marketcap despite doing literally nothing. DOGE is a token intentionally designed to be a truly terrible token, madly inflationary and does nothing yet it has a 24B marketcap. Do you honestly think these tokens are going to be worth anything in 5 years? And cardano doesn't even have hype to support it any more lol it's old af.

"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> &#x200B;
> 
> # Ethereum: Use-case driving value
> 
> Ethereum is a very valuable Blockchain. This blockchain is driven by innovation and utility. To understand what makes Ethereum such a valuable eco-system we need to discuss the inner-working of Ethereum.
> 
> # Introduction: Ethereum explained
> 
> According to [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) :
> 
> >What is Ethereum?
> 
> Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet.
> 
> So the topic driving this discussion is badly worded. If we are discussing top coins then we should discuss Ether and not Ethereum. Since Ethereum is such an interesting ecosystem I will treat this argument as a pro Ethereum post. I'd love to see the discussion focused on Ether next time.
> 
> Ethereum is not managed by a single entity nor managed by the Ethereum Foundation but is managed through a decentralized process explained [In their governance page](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/).
> 
> Time for some metrics: Ethereum is currently trading north of 1750 $ and has a circulating supply of 122 millions ETH for a Market cap at around 218 billions
> 
> Let's go back to the quote: ""Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money"". This point is important. Ether is not the only coin which is using the Ethereum blockchain. A lot of value on the Ethereum Blockchain is not in Ether coins. This will be discussed further down. Ethereum is also home to global payment, so Ether and other cryptocurrencies can be used to settle transactions between P2P in a permissionless way.
> 
> Applications called Dapps exist on the blockchain. We are going to discuss all of these aspects. We are also going to tackle NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain.
> 
> Ethereum is also completed by L2s. These are going to be mentioned.
> 
> Ethereum has been switched from POW to Asic resistant POW to POS. These are going to be discussed.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to digital money.
> 
> Ethereum strength is that the blockchain is home to many cryptocurrencies. If gas fees are paid in Ether, many tokens have billions circulating in the Ethereum ecosystem. A quick look at Etherscans reveal how strong the ethereum ecosystem is.
> 
> According to [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/tokens) the blockchain has 40 Billions $ in USDT, 46 Billions in USDC and 7 Billions $ in Wrapped BTC. The market cap of Ether may be around 200 billions but the on chain value of assets in the Ethereum Blockchain is far higher.
> 
> All of these USDT and USDC are stablecoins which can be used for transactions. In fact, it can be used for P2P transaction in a permissionless way but also to buy stuff from businesses. [Here is a list of business accepting USDT (which exists in the Ethereum blockchain)](https://nowpayments.io/blog/businesses-accepting-tether) and [Here is a list of business accepting directly Ethereum](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-companies-accepting-ethereum-as-a-payment-method-in-2022/)
> 
> These classical transactions are not the only use of the Ethereum Blockchain: Dapps and NFT are also thriving !
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to dapps and NFTs
> 
> Ethereum is home to a lot of different applications: Marketplaces, exchanges, defi, wallets, games...
> 
> These application are different because they are called dapps:
> 
> >A decentralised application (DApp,\\[1\\] dApp,\\[2\\] Dapp, or dapp) is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that run on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system.\\[3\\]
> 
> [Wikipedia Dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application)
> 
> To give a glance to these dapps you can head to this website tho be wary of the first dapp listed being an advertisement for shady businesses (I haven't found a better website to source dapps) [Here you go](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum/1)
> 
> While I don't believe in the current state of NFT technology being viable (See my write up in favor of NFT speaking about the future of this technology), we have to take into account that even after losing 60% of their value there is still 3 Billions USD in NFTs in the Ethereum Blockchain [Source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-nft-collections-lost-nearly-60-of-their-market-cap-in-2022-report)
> 
> # Ethereum: Layers of goodness.
> 
> Ethereum can be a bit expensive for people, this is why it was layered. There are side chains existing just to be cheaper than Ethereum while offering bridges to and from Ethereum. For example Polygon.
> 
> >Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution created to help bring mass adoption to the Ethereum platform. It caters to the diverse needs of developers by providing tools to create scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that prioritize performance, user experience (UX), and security.
> 
> So if you want to be able to evaluate Ethereum you need to go and read about the biggest layer 2 pro and cons.
> 
> [A small list of Ethereum layer 2 given by Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)
> 
> # Ethereum: Evolve to thrive
> 
> Ethereum has been a rapidly evolving ecosystem. It has seen the evolution of mining from GPU to Asic. In order to not become reliant on Asic mining, Ethereum was made Asic resistant. This created other problems: A pressure on the GPU market but also a concern for energy efficiency. In order to improve the footprint but also reduce the fees, Ethereum was made to transistion from POW to POS. Proof of stake is a protocol in which you need to stake coins to run a node in the network.
> 
> This shows an ability to look ahead and to tackle challenges.
> 
> # Conclusion: Ethereum is a rapidly evolving ecosystem which has a lot of value in it. Since Ether is their native coin, all of this impacts Ether's value.
> 
> This is where we go back to the TOP COIN aspect of this write up. Everything I have said has an impact on the value and use of Ether. If you believe in the future of the Ethereum Blockchain, you can go ahead and look a bit more into Ether. If you don't believe in the Ethereum Blockchain then you should try to find a competitor.
> 
> Just know that Ethereum is trying to become deflationary and that their economic outlook seems on par with good cryptos.
> 
> Ethereum is one of the techs of the future and this essay has shown some of the most important aspects of it.
> 
> Have fun !

"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chysce which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> **>> Scalability**
> 
> Ethereum's greatest challenge is [scalability](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/ethereum-scaling/introduction-to-ethereum-scaling/). This issue manifests in two ways - long transaction times and high fees. The large number of transactions on ethereum network can cause congestion resulting in delays and very high gas fees. Ethereum Merge event did not resolve this issue, it only paved the way for future optimizations of gas fees.
> 
> **>> Ethereum is not so decentralized**
> 
> Despite its decentralized nature, Ethereum has become increasingly centralized over time, with a small number of entities controlling a large portion of the network's resources and governance. For regular Ethereum user it is hard to run a node so they have to rely on [external node infrastructure providers](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/blockchain-node-providers) who can censor whatever they want.
> 
> **>> Vulnerable to attacks**
> 
> Transition to proof of stake made Ethereum more [vulnerable to attacks](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-merge-makes-network-more-vulnerable-to-attack-security-expert). *""Unlike proof-of work systems, a proof-of-stake (PoS) system informs node validators in advance what blocks they will validate, thus enabling them to plan attacks.""*
> 
> **>>  Solidity barrier**
> 
> Another issue with Ethereum is its programming language. Developers who are proficient in C, Python or Java cannot easily transition to Ethereum and create dApps. They must instead learn a completely different coding language (Solidity). This slows down the process of onboarding new developers and creating dApps.
> 
> **>> Ethereum could be labeled a security**
> 
> There are early [hints](https://www.theblock.co/post/220297/gensler-suggests-proof-of-stake-tokens-are-securities) that ETH might be labeled a security. If that happens any US citizen would have to hire a licensed broker to buy and sell ETH for them. This would significantly hinder its growth potential.

"some rules I've set for myself when investing in cryptocurrencies:

*Do Your Own Research (DYOR) : Thoroughly research any coin or project before investing. Understand its purpose, technology, team, and market potential.

*Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into a single cryptocurrency. Spread your investments across different coins and projects to mitigate risk.

*Set Clear Goals: Define your investment goals and strategy, whether it's short-term trading or long-term holding. Stick to these goals to avoid impulsive decisions.

*Risk Management : Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, and there's always a risk of losing your investment.

*Use Stop-Loss Orders : Protect your investments by setting stop-loss orders to automatically sell if the price drops to a certain level.

*Secure Your Investments : Use hardware wallets or other secure methods to store your cryptocurrencies. Avoid leaving large amounts on exchanges.

*Stay Updated : Keep up with news and developments in the crypto space. Regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market sentiment can all impact prices.

*Avoid FOMO and FUD : Don’t make decisions based on fear of missing out (FOMO) or fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Stick to your research and strategy.

*Take Profits : Regularly take profits to lock in gains. Don’t be too greedy; set profit targets and sell portions of your holdings when these targets are met.

*Be Patient : The crypto market can be extremely volatile. Be prepared for ups and downs and avoid making hasty decisions during market swings.

"On chain forensics is not particularly hard. 

Think about it in the context of Bitcoin:

Imagine you and a friend went out for coffee but you forgot your wallet. Perhaps your friend pays for your coffee, and you decided to compensate them by sending some Bitcoin directly to reimburse them. When they receive the Bitcoin, they would have your public key, which would allow them to see not only how much they sent you, but how much BTC you have in your wallet right now, and they would be able to trace any transaction you have ever made from that wallet. 

Thus, you can see the importance of privacy Layer 2s or privacy-focused alt-coins.

Hodling bitcoin until retirement age. Some spend/replace is good for supporting adoption.

"I've seen a few people talk about borrowing against their crypto but I am not keen to do that with such a volatile asset.

Still just figuring out what is best for me so it's good to hear from other people with similar goals.

For perspective on my situation.

"I made some nice gains on certain altcoin picks over the last year. But one thing I've learned is you can lose money buying into overhyped coins that end up being scams.

With this, you have to do a ton of research and not just buy into whatever coin is suggested in this forum. I like using sites like Traders Union to learn about different altcoin projects. On the good side, they break down the tech, the team, the roadmap, etc in a way that cuts through the marketing hype.

A couple of altcoins I'm pretty bullish on right now are “Ethereum” because of its potential for NFTs/DeFi, and Algorand because of its strong developer community and focus on real-world blockchain use cases for finance. But I'd avoid getting too deep into meme coins or brand-new launches unless you truly understand what they're trying to do.

Stick to altcoins with clear use cases, solid development teams, and active communities. It is given that alt coins are a high risk, high reward game. You could make a fortune if you get in early on the next Ethereum. But a lot of them are just speculative gambles with little real-world utility.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiOVk1WHZ4bGVZUDVHUzVqYVFIcnJLYTB1dzlkbjRzQnRLOUFiTm1zYTNzZHNxT0hpN1ZOcGZpeERGOTdIOWJic19Pa1h5c3BaS3dRT0RpeUltVTJ3TkE9PQ==

"As for strategies when buying an altcoin, most try to look at a mix of factors rather than just going in blind. Market cap is a popular metric. Here, you'll see more volatility but also more potential upside with lower market cap coins.

Checking how long the project has been around and analyzing the core team's backgrounds can give you a sense of trust too.

Maybe most importantly though, I'd recommend looking into the community around a coin before investing. Are there active discussions happening? How strong is the holder base? Just remember that strong communities with good backing can help drive long-term support.

If you're looking for a good resource on building an investment strategy, make sure to see articles on the Traders Union website. They've got guides focused on helping you develop a purchasing plan that aligns with your risk tolerance.

Still, no matter your experience, none of us can control the wild crypto market.

Investing more than you can afford definitely adds a ton of unnecessary stress.

"Currently my plan is to sell 20-50% spread between mid Q4 of this year and early Q3 of next, some of the money I pull off the table I will keep and use, some in offset account, some towards a new vehicle, just lifestyle stuff. Some of what I pull out will also sit in offset account but will be waiting to be deployed if the price drops low enough. Still working out exactly what dates, and what percentage per date, also what price I need the coins to be worth at each selling point before it's worth selling, because if doesn't reach the value I fully expect it to, at a certain point I'm better off just hanging onto it. I only have 10% net worth invested (was much less but it's grown to 10%) so if I cannot touch the money it's ok, but at the same time I'd like to take some off it makes sense to do so. It feels better because then if the downswing never happens I'm happy because the value of what I'm holding keeps going up, and if it falls away after I sell I'm happy because then I can look at buying back to the same position I am holding now but at a discount. The only way this ends up bad for me is if it goes down before I get a chance to sell some, but I will not consider selling anything before December or so.

"Yeah, I only hold BTC, ETH, and SOL. BTC and ETH are from 2 years ago so BTC has 4x'd and ETH 3x'd. SOL from more recently, I think it's about 10% down currently but is a smaller position. I'm most bullish about BTC at the moment so might sell a smaller percentage of that compared to the other two. Still thinking and taking on board other people's plans. At some stage I will come up with an exit strategy to follow. It's probably about 6 months before I take anything (and maybe longer) so I have a lot of time to think. Actually, I've written down 3 possible exit strategies but I need time to pick which one to use (or if it's something different) and even if I choose a strategy there may be changes that are better.

So basically, your cost basis is capped out at 10% of what's on your w2, meaning you can only deduct that figure from your realized profits....  so youre paying more capital gains tax?  Is there really such a provision on this bill?

"Project 2025, also known as the Presidential Transition Project, is a collection of policy proposals to fundamentally reshape the U.S. federal government in the event of a Republican victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[2][3] Established in 2022, the project aims to recruit tens of thousands of conservatives to the District of Columbia to replace existing federal civil servants—whom Republicans characterize as part of the ""deep state""—and to further the objectives of the next Republican president.[4] It adopts a maximalist version of the unitary executive theory—which asserts that the president has absolute power over the executive branch upon inauguration.[3][5] Unitary executive theory is a disputed interpretation of Article II of the Constitution of the United States.[6][7]

Project 2025 envisions widespread changes across the entire government, particularly with regard to economic and social policies and the role of the federal government and its agencies. The plan proposes slashing funding for the Department of Justice (DOJ), dismantling the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sharply reducing environmental and climate change regulations to favor of fossil fuel production, eliminating the Department of Commerce, and ending the independence of various federal agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).[8][9] The blueprint seeks to institute tax cuts,[10] though its writers disagree on the wisdom of protectionism.[11]
Project 2025 recommends abolishing the Department of Education, whose programs would be either transferred to other government agencies, or terminated.[12][13] Scientific research would receive federal funding only if it suits conservative principles.[14]
The Project urges the government to explicitly reject abortion as health care[15][16] and to restrict access to contraception.[17] The Heritage Foundation, an American conservative think tank that leads the development of Project 2025, stated in April 2024 that ""the radical Left hates families"" and ""wants to eliminate the family and replace it with the state"" while driving the country to emulate totalitarian nations, such as North Korea. The Project seeks to infuse the government with elements of Christianity, stating in its Mandate that ""freedom is defined by God, not man."" Project 2025 proposes criminalizing pornography,[18] removing protections against discrimination based on sexual or gender identity,[18][19] and terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs,[4][19] as well as affirmative action.[20]
The Project advises the future president to immediately deploy the military for domestic law enforcement and to direct the DOJ to pursue Donald Trump's adversaries by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807.[21][22] It recommends the arrest, detention, and deportation of undocumented immigrants across the country.[23] It promotes capital punishment and the speedy ""finality"" of such sentences.[24] Project director Paul Dans, a former Trump administration official, explained that Project 2025 is ""systematically preparing to march into office and bring a new army, aligned, trained, and essentially weaponized conservatives ready to do battle against the deep state.""[25][26] Dans admitted that it was ""counterintuitive"" to recruit so many people to join the government in order to shrink it, but pointed out the need for a future President to ""regain control"" of the federal government.[4]
Although the project does not promote a specific presidential candidate, many contributors have close ties to Donald Trump and his presidential campaign.[7][27] The Heritage Foundation has developed Project 2025 in collaboration with over 100 partners including Turning Point USA, led by its executive director Charlie Kirk; the Conservative Partnership Institute including former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows as senior partner; the Center for Renewing America, led by former Trump Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought; and America First Legal, led by former Trump Senior Advisor Stephen Miller.[28][29] The Project is detailed in Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise, a version of which Heritage has written as transition plans for each prospective Republican president since 1980.[30]
Critics of Project 2025 have described it as an authoritarian Christian nationalist movement[31] and a path for the United States to become an autocracy. Several experts in law have indicated that it would undermine the rule of law and the separation of powers.[8] Some conservatives and Republicans also criticized the plan, for example in the contexts of centralizing power,[4] climate change,[32] and foreign trade.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjUEljUU1LbXBHaDJlWmZnRUtHQWhQNzZab1V1WTY5VUdIdVV6NWtmWnZobFdGWHVIYkF5WHVYRUxxMmg2YUZnd1VDV2FiZUR2Rm5RTGc0VjlqdUNlc2hBVWllOHZ2LThmYzJleEhSYi1Na0U9

"All of you pro-crypto democrats must be teetering on the edge of suicide. It’s the democrats in the U.S house and senate that have been the biggest roadblocks to crypto adoption/fact. Elizabeth Warren. Brad Sherman. Sherrod Brown. Maxine Waters. Sean Casten. Gary Gensler at the SEC. 
Trump has said in the past that he wasn’t a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and that’s because BTC is inefficient and there is a lot of crypto garbage out there. What Trump means to say is that he is pro ISO 20022 coins. (XRP, ALGO, XLM, XDC, HBAR and a few others). 
And don’t start the “Jay Clayton was a Trump appointment and sued Ripple on his last day in office” argument. Because most politicians are scumbags. And it was no skin off Clayton’s nose to file a law suit on his last day. He wasn’t going to be in the job that Gensler took over. It was Gensler’s job to try and thwart Ripple’s progress. Which he did. But now that case is coming to a final resolution. Gensler is about to be gone. Trump is about to be President again.

Best advice I can give you is trade only with what u can lose. At first u will lose but you will also learn. You’re getting in at a great time.

"A safe bet would be to invest in coins with great utility but which are not listed on Coinbase/binance yet. During a bull run, listings on those exchanges can cause some extra momentum in comparison to other coins.

You therefore might want to consider KAS and if you are willing to invest in micro caps you could consider KALIS. 

Rumors of Binance listing KAS are becoming stronger and KRC-20 is coming too. Solves the trilemma, with unprecedented speed.

KALIS would be a bigger bet but is a coin with enormous potential. Market cap currently less than 5 mil, but they have a real product already. This is about product certification, combining NFT, NFC and Blockchain technology. T1 Exchange listing coming very soon.

"Trading is a competition. The shorter the timeframe we looking to buy and sell the make a profit, the more competitive it is. Quarterly and yearly holding times are safer for non-professionals. 

A safe approach is to split a $10,000 account across 9 crypto ($1,000) each, and $1,000 is cash or stablecoin. 

Wait for big volatility spikes to take some off to bring the balance back down to $1,000. Also, on dips (~10%) buy some more to bring the balance back to $1,000. So we should always have some cash.

If we leverage our account, a normal 10% move (which is noise in crypto) will wipe us out. Only the broker and the broker's kids benefit from this.

"Define what you you’re really looking for, timeline, risk tolerance, develop a strategy and stick to it.  You can modify the strategy as you go along, but be very wary of FUD and FOMO, this is a time for Fear & Greed in equal parts.

You’re never going to figure out all the thousands of coins/tokens, look for staking opportunities and remember, if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is!

Decide on a CEX, learn about DeFi, and different wallets, what they provide and why, I’d say this is critical before you buy anything!  (You’ll need a CEX regardless to buy & sell).  Your jurisdiction can be an influence in this regard.  

As others have said, BTC ETH are a good bet for not losing anything, if you’re risk adverse, however don’t expect a 10X, or even a 4X (IMO).

"If you’re new then I’d stick with safer coins at least with 70% of your money - ETH and SOL for example don’t have the same risk of loss as most altcoins do 

For the other 30% you can move down the risk curve, but not too far - look at things like LINK, ROSE, MINA, OCEAN, FET.  I’m not telling you to buy these but they’re smaller market caps with potential higher upside than ETH and SOL.

Learn about market cap and how it affects performance, and also learn the difference between market cap and fully diluted valuation (FDV) 

Don’t follow influencers blindly - some might lead you to good coins, but remember all are trying to buy before you and sell before you too 

Join some telegram groups - every coin has one and there are others that are more social and people will share advice and war stories that can help you

You are correct. Avoid all software wallets. Also, do NOT instally Ledger or Trezor on your Mobile phone ever. Do so on a 2nd laptop at home - but make sure the OSWindows or MAc are upto date, and get Tor as well. If you want to use exchange - check out Kraken & Coinbase. BUT Only use the Pro version - can only buy & sell ; can't swap. On the retail side of CB, you can swap - BUT it is very expensive commissions ! Again you need driver license, passport, to be VERIFIED on Coinbase & Kraken for here in UK. Make sure you do this properly..and do not rush...take your time.

Other good options to diversify your portfolio are SOL, LINK, DOT, ADA, and other altcoins.

- Do not invest blindly or give in to FOMO or emotional investing.

- Start DCAing into Bitcoin and keep HODLing your investment.

- Consider ETH and SOL as safer, good options.

- Diversify your portfolio with other altcoins like LINK, DOT, ADA, LTC, BNB, and more. Diversification will essentially help you divide your losses so if one coin underperforms, the others can offset that loss.

- Once you have gotten the hang of the market and done thorough research and have some extra money to experiment with, you can look into meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE.

"Check out moonbag. New meme but has got a good tokenomic for getting profits on the day of release. Its still in its presale here: https://moonbag.org.

99% of memes are junk. However, if you can find one with an active community (telegram, discord etc) and an actual whitepaper with a plan of some sort you may be able to make some money.

Look for new coins. Memes that have already come through a bull run previously will not gain much in the next bull run.

Also, always invest only what you can afford to lose as any meme (or any crypto) can fall to zero in minutes. Going on dex screener and trying to be smart is going to get you rekt. Bots are much quicker than us and you are guaranteed to lose money.

"in the UK, no one can access Binance. it's simply not authorized by Binance to UK residents. Tor, doesnt even help get around it...

Try both CocalCola & Pepsi or Mercedes Vs. BMW. ie: Get Both Coinbase AND Kraken, but only use the Pro side of each (yes, you can swap on the 'retail' side of both, but you get extra burned by the Commission & bad conversion ratio. Now to have both Kraken & Coinbase Super Legitimize you, get your Bank account linked up with both. Then check what are the Transfer in or out LIMITS of cash/FIAT money and redemptions etc... However, the point is - if you are OPENING 1 Exchange that day, you may as well apply simultaneously for the other... and then compare one to the other. Also TRADE with same quantity of Coins/tokens on 1 Exchange and the other (do 50/50) and keep comparing. Once you have access to both Exchanges..it's good. There is more VOLUME on Coinbase I noticed ...which means maybe the Buy/Sell at Market happen quicker... look at Coinmarketcap on the Coins/Tokens you want buy, to see which exchange has the biggest percentage of volume/transactions.

NB: Am keen to open a Binance account, as apparently, commissions are even lower...but I will wait until Binance is officially able to operate in the UK. The point is...open as many EXCHANGE accounts if you want with KYC/AML done by the Exchange...but NEVER ever trust their Wallets, and shift your coins tokens back to your cold wallet if you plan to  keep long term. There are no fees to keep an empty Wallet/Account on Kraken / Coinbase.

Last point - I would personally NEVER open any Exchange account where they dont want to do KYC or AML. Because the coins/tokens that you buy on that exchange, may be from questionable/dodgy sources that can also be comingled with the rest of your 'clean' coins/tokens bought on proper exchanges, and Kraken or Coinbase may have the tools to see you got some 'bad' tokens that are blacklisted and so your whole account then gets stuck for an investigation.  This is why Im also worried that the few times I did Changelly (based in Hong Kong) - the coins that I got weren't 'teinted' and to this day, when Ive transferred them into Kraken or Coinbase, I havent been locked out. Maybe the amount / quantity was too small ? but who knows...",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkcUp3Sk5oTDN6d2ZaSW9RNnVnSEVzNEthLWFXSmhUcjBSQzh1dmNTX1RsMlRYaFZoSVJ4bEQyZkRhUFhoRnduOU9oZ0tpaDFEaVlRZjZCWFlRQ21mT3FNblhPR2V3LV90RnNWRExTOExSb289
"There’s a very HIGH chance you have lost that crypto. If Coinbase does accept BNB network in the future, you MIGHT get lucky. Coinbase is not the best when it comes to issues like this. I don’t think that asset recovery is going to do anything for you, but I would certainly adjust that option to be certain. 
I’m sure you now know, You have to be VERY careful with sending crypto to your wallet, transferring from one wallet to another, and basically everything you do with crypto. Mainly because there is very little point of contact with these wallets and exchanges, and if you f up, it’s hard to get it fixed. 
I’m just letting you know your situation. I have made errors with crypto as well, it’s an evolving process.

"I’m confident it will play out very similarly to the last bull run. 

In early 2021 Dogecoin trended with BTC and ETH hit its all time high. I only had a small portion of my net worth tied to the crypto market but I was watching the ongoing discussion here on Reddit and on Twitter. In May 2021 the crypto market hit the top of its first of the two big upward pushes and the bottom fell out for Doge. There were a few people that publicly said they took their profits, but the vast majority of people were talking about how it was just a short term stumble and “DOGE to the moon!”… but it didn’t go to the moon. It just started dipping more and more and more, and all of the scared bagholders turned to angry bagholders as BTC and ETH reversed course and went on to make their ultimate cycle top all-time highs while Doge continued to drop. 

Now, why do I think Doge failed to rebound? Because people knew all along that it’s actually a dog s*** coin that has a cute dog graphic on it. Thats exactly what PEPE and TURBO are… useless cryptos that are going to have their bottom drop out, probably whenever the market hits its first significant resistance and stumbles. 

As for BTC and ETH, their all time highs were only a day apart from each other in the last run. I expect they will trend together throughout the whole thing, especially with ETF money helping drive the ship for both of them.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkbFNWbmhNUEZBX2lzSVgwTml2X3g0T2JpZGRsVVBRRXVTMVh2Zm1fc0FoTFo0OXRsLUdCRUVoMHRQWnJsR195bjJyeno3ckppbUVIbGY1bnBnbEw5emE1U2UtRHFJczRvOWNxNGx2NEhvOTg9

"Yeah will be interesting to see. I personally don't have any of the shit coins. I have some BTC and ETH from mid 2022 which has grown but I have never added to or sold, and some SOL which is much smaller but bought more recently. I am planning to offload some, maybe 30-50% depending on factors during this bull run and then buy back into the market when it dips. Hard to do right so trying to learn as much as I can. I have some guide numbers in mind already and some exit strategy models which I have come up with already, but I think I will be very active for the next 6-12 months to identify any changes and adjust all my expectations as we go. 

So I guess from this you're saying that if PEPE and BONK are still surging that we probably have not reached our peak in BTC and ETH yet, but that once they crash we may still go up but the crash also could be coming.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdlNrcjFxbDQ4NTgtNGdIQWI4VFVRZ3kyWWRsSUNVY29GUFJwcFNvblNVeDd6N3lLUUJhN2NJQkRyOGdQNm5kSmFtNnBzYi1wcUk0S3g0WllMeENIUlE9PQ==

"For a new investor in the crypto space, the biggest advice I would give is to do some research on whatever you are planning to invest in. There is a lot of crypto out there that has some amazing technology behind it, and even more ""memecoins"" that don't provide any true utility. The memecoins may pump for a while, but eventually, the tokens with true utility will be the ones that keep increasing in value and stand the test of time. 

Well-known tokens such as BTC and ETH are always a good bet for investors. Just don't expect any of the amazing 10-100x returns in these anytime soon as they already have a high market cap. 

The project im moat invested in myself at the moment is Zypto. It has a low market cap at the moment with huge growth potential. Zypto has a real company behind it who have created their own revolutionary payment systems to help business integrate the ability to accept crypto payments directly for goods and services. They also have virtual and physical crypto cards, which you can use like a debit card at most retailers to purchase goods and services with your cryptocurrencies. And to round it all out they have just launched the new Zypto App which is an all in one wallet app where you can swap crypto, hold it in a secure wallet, buy crypto cards and earn rewarda in the form of ""Zyps"" which rewards holders of the Zypto token and those that complete tasks. Zyps can then be redeemed for crypto or other products and services. Definitely check out the website and read the white paper!

As I said earlier though, do your own research on any potential investment in the space. Join project Telegram chats and engage with the community to learn more before investing.

"You must DYOR about what to invest in, I recommend to check these two projects that I never regret buying ($Ocean and $PiCA)

Ocean Protocol, which is my favorite AI project, will bring enormous changes to societies in the near future. It creates something like a P2P market where the main asset is Data.

"I would say $ZYPTO is extremely slept on at the moment, but they just released their app, huge marketing push is about to start, and ETH ETFs are going to push it well beyond 100m marketcap in the near future. If you're looking for a solid, low marketcap investment that you can hold for a while, I definitely recommend looking into them. I think it has the most potential of becoming a $1 Billion+ level marketcap out of all of the low marketcap coins. Sure, you could get lucky with a memecoin, but not worth the risk IMO. Like I said before, this project is solid and has great utility. The app is great and has a 5 star rating on the Play Store with over 1k downloads in the first week. It just launched last Tuesday on Android and will be launching on Apple Store soon. Plus, just by holding $ZYPTO you earn Zyps which can be redeemed for crypto.

If he’s paying you, it shouldn’t have to go to a wallet on his exchange.

Imagine you got a web design / programming job at let’s say PayPal, but PayPal says, ‘um, hey, so what’s your PayPal account so we can pay you?’

Even with it being PayPal you would probably say ‘umm, can you not just direct deposit into my bank?’

I’d never trust a company that wants work done like a ‘hey do this and I’ll give you $800.’ Or something. Even in crypto, and especially running an exchange, you should be keeping meticulous records.

"There's a number of Technical Analysis books available to read. There's no difference between crypto or stocks when learning TA. Its just crypto is way more volatile. The basics of TA doesn't charge. 

Read up on Candlestick's first. The candlestick body and the wicks and what it means. Then learn about different shapes of candles. Then grouping of candles. https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/how-to-read-candlesticks-beginners-guide

After that move on to patterns. Using line tools and drawing resistance and support lines to find patterns. Learn what each pattern means. Bullish or bearish patterns. https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/learning-center/Idenitfying-Chart-Patterns.pdf

After you learn those basics above☝️, move onto indicators. The best indicator I recommend is the Ichimoku Kumo. When you learn all aspects of this indicator you will have the ability to see a huge amount of information of what is going on in whatever time frame you are looking at. https://www.ichimoku-kinko-hyo.info/en/pages/the-ichimoku-cloud-kumo.html

Ichimoku is a Japanese word. It means ""one look"" or another way to say it is ""a glance"". 

Kumo means ""cloud""

When you know how to read this and interpret all the information it's an incredibly powerful indicator! You can get a large amount of information from a short look at a chart with this indicator on any timeframe!

The Fibonacci retracement tool & the trend based Fibonacci tool are also very good tools to learn as well. Combined with the ichimoku they help confirm many things.

There's a lot more other indicators and tools to learn, but learn the basics I stated above first. Very important to learn the basics first! Always make a trade on the confirmation of a pattern. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/confirmationonachart.asp


These things I've given you above ☝️ will take you months to fully learn and grasp the basics. At least 6 months if you practice regularly. DON'T TRADE until you are comfortable knowing these basics. Do dummy trades for practice before actually putting money down. And then when you do start trading for real, be prepared to loose money in the beginning. Think of it as your tuition fee into trading. 

The last bit of advice about trading that you need to know, is to get to the point where you trust the work that you did. Trust the information that you gather from your own TA. DON'T let emotions dictate your decisions on your trade or other people! Trust the information you gather. Emotions will get you REKT!",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSXdHbjVMRjhFYWNLQXh0QzdFNkRKWWxCOTlJSE5FVFBYMmVWcWhMSEl4amxrX0RPUVFiRmFNTUFxRC1KZ2k5NnlpTFM4eEVJRmo5UmRZTHBUcy1VT3c9PQ==

"For me, you need to start by nailing down the core concepts and basics. Familiarize yourself with order types, risk management, technical analysis, fundamentals, reading order books and charts, news analysis, etc. Don't just scan this stuff, but deeply understand it inside-out.

Once you have that base down, then look for quality advanced material on specific strategies, asset classes, trade types, etc. that interest you. Maybe you want to specialize in futures, options, margin, algos, scalping, and swing trades. With this, you need to find courses or books focused specifically on those areas.

When I started in this market, I got many free educational resources from the Traders Union. This page has discussed everything, covering the basics and technicals of crypto trading. Plus, apply what you learn through demo trading until you develop consistent profitability. Do not risk actual capital until you're consistently green and have proper risk management deeply.

It's also wise to find a community of traders you can learn from through discussion. Surround yourself with smarter traders and absorb that knowledge. Ignore all those YouTube videos and signal services promising ridiculous gains. That's not how you develop real, profitable trading skills. Instead, focus on building a solid education foundation first.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVHVhckxuMXZFajhlVk5XaVR0Nlplb1NDbmlqMmM0bS10dHFvWnEtS2tKaVpUREgzM3o5VVFacFlBcVFFNWw4d3NzSllvTWx0WlVGaktjSGx0REFTVUE9PQ==

"People hate on it because they think it's centralised (it's not) and that it's a bankers coin (meh). I can kinda see there last argument but isn't the point of crypto to be a financial used asset? We will always need banks and it's inevitable that crypto and banking will be as one eventually. People may not like the WEF or BIS but if ripple is working with them and hundreds of other banks and organisation's, then that should show you how much potential ripple and XRP has. People who shit on XRP don't follow the news and partnerships ripple are in so still think it's a centralised bankers coin with poor tokenomics, when it's tokenomics actually help with solving the liquidity problem that the banks are facing. People might say it goes against crypto and be your own bank but truth be told the banks will always win. And as for people pointing to TA and saying the chart looks terrible also don't know the potential and aren't looking at the macro. We're at the end of a descending wedge, getting squeezed ready for a big move and with it being bull season very soon, it's gonna be a big move up in my opinion. I'm sure someone will chime in and tell you how bad it is based purely off how ''badly'' it's performed compared to others, but then I'd just point out the case and the constant fud XRP has faced despite all the partnerships and projects ripple are involved with.

"I agree, You should never lose yourself in any single part of TA. Learning all aspects of TA is a good thing. It helps you build better strategies. You can compare different tools and indicators results against each other and see whether they line up or not. If multiple different indicators and tools show similar zones of support or resistance it helps to confirm those areas as being strong. TA is never certain. It only gives you information for you to make better informed decisions. The more information you have, the better your strategy building will be. 

Elliot Wave theory is another strategy. There's a number of people out there that only do EW and say anything else is useless and pointless. I don't understand their thinking. While I enjoy playing around with EW, I never base any trade off of it. But if a wave count matches up with other TA, it helps with confirmation of trend reversals on different time frames. Both Fibonacci tools and Elliott Waves work well together. Combine them with ichimoku its pretty good. 

But for me personally the ichimoku kumo is a massively powerful indicator. The amount of information you can gather from it with a very short amount of time looking at the chart is incredible. Its multiple moving averages combined together. It shows areas of support and resistance as well as trends ending and beginning. All you need to do is skip through different time frames and you can see huge amounts of information at a glance. Provided you know how to interpret all the information properly. Over the years I've used other tools and indicators with the ichimoku and what I've learnt is that they line up with the ichimoku quite a lot.  I don't spend a lot of time staring at charts anymore. But when I do have a look at them, the ichimoku gives me a huge amount of information very quickly. But every now and then I go deep and spends hours doing in depth TA simply for the enjoyment of doing TA 😜.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlLVk5NnNvbGF6Zk5pakhOQlBjdXZWbkpqQXdsWFdGYXFlTl9NNVZIZ2toODZLcHdUSG9wRW13cXB0UnVBeW1mVVQxbW04VlE0el9NemM0YVoySFdwWVE9PQ==

"By in large there really aren't any guarantees in crypto. You can vet the developers and see if there's any real venture capital behind a project which definitely helps, but still nothing certain. 

Keeping your tokens in a hot wallet or cold storage avoids issues of the actual platform scamming you, like FTX, or a platform going broke and taking your money like Celsius. 

If you want to do any long-term holding, it's probably best to stick with Bitcoin. The bigger stuff like Eth or Solana or something we can mostly be sure they'll stick around, but still no guarantees. Check out the Top 10 tokens from 2017 and again in 2021 and you'll see even the biggest ones can vanish long-term.

Alts (any non-BTC token) lose 95%+ of their value in the bear market. And that's if the project even survives through a bear market.

"Bitcoin is the obvious safe choice. Look at any chain that enables BTC interoperability, I personally hold CKB. It's a perfect L2 to Bitcoin, been around over 5 years now, already had its first halving last year, and an insane amount of development has been going towards joining CKB to BTC in the last 3 months. Effectively, the goal is to take all the valuable characteristics of ETH or SOL and secure them by BTC. Smart contracts on BTC, various proof sidechains on BTC, BTC interoperability, etc.

Honestly, I see a lot of the projects that exist to compete with Bitcoin either dying off or joining Bitcoin in the next 8 years because their only reason for existing is that they can do what Bitcoin cannot. Imagine if they could be built on top of Bitcoin, not to compete, but to improve and expand the OG ecosystem.

Can BTc or Eth give you a 1000x on the investment in a short period of time (example in 3 years).

Others know that if that meme coin gives them a 10x then it would be a good return. And they see this as mere gamble.  There are people who buy lottery tickets hoping to get rich. Others do that with meme coins.

"Last time we had a major correction the market was mostly gambling on memecoins and what that indicates is that serious investors are outnumbered by gamblers. To sustain high prices you need a constant inflow of new money but when you lose investors the gamblers usually don't last long and the market tanks.

"Hey,
10+ years financial investor here. Congrats to your decision to invest and sorry if I jump to conclusions but I challenge your decision: have you thought about why you want to invest? HODL strategy sounds good but before you invest in such a high risk asset, have you thought about asset diversification? What is your low and mid risk asset? Have a look at ETFs for example as low/mid risk investments first. Then, and only then -depending on your experience- go on to crypto. A well-thought diversed portfolio has only 10-20% of the available capital in high risk assets like crypto. 
Not only is it high-risk, it‘s also quite complex with alle the wallets and stuff. Make sure you fully understand how it works and what the differences are between cold and hot storage. 
After that, make yourself an investment plan: invest all your money at once? Possibly not the best idea in such a volatile environment. DCA is your keyword.
IMO you should also understand the basics of market analysis. BTC is at the ATH, could be a point of reversal but the general sentiment is quite bullish. Hm what to do?
I don’t know your background so sorry if I underestimate your experience but your questions lead me to the conclusion that you have a lot of homework to do :)

"Thank you. Indeed I have a lot of homework to do. I'm from the Middle East. I come from a security background so I have little to no knowledge in investment. Unfortunately, we cannot invest in US stocks over here, otherwise, that would have been my first option. The only available investments here are either to buy real estate (which is not promising in increasing of value) or to put the money in bank and take interest. I have a US bank account, which I use to keep my assets, but it gives me a low interest. Banks here are not reliable so I don't trust them with a dime.

1. Stocks
2. Crypto
3. Real Estate
4. Share certificates",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRk5ESmZWdzU1ZEY0TzdUOGhfR1RXUnFtZlh3WWMxem5GREJ5c2tKX2lsZE5OOXFxRWJRbmltTUZHVEM0ejFLSE1mUHV6cnRjalk5LVlEcHZUbGxtSFE9PQ==

"Thanks for providing your background. Tricky, indeed. Crypto sounds like an easy way compared to the other options.
My suggestion: put some money on an exchange (binance is big and quite safe, whatever that means in this crypto world)
Buy regularly. For example:
Buy every Sunday. Start with 100$. If BTC Price on the following Sunday is lower buy for 100$ again. If it’s higher than the Sunday before, half your investment (50$).
On the next Sunday check again: 
Higher? Half again (25$)
Lower? 100$ again 

Repeat.

Additional feature: instead of always investing 100$ if it’s lower, double your amount of last Sunday. 
Sunday1: 100$
Sunday 2, higher: 50$
Sunday 3, higher: 25$
Sunday 4, lower: 50$
Etc.

Even easier, on Binance you can setup an auto invest: buy automatically with a pre-planned interval and amount.

If you like to get a bit more risky split up your investment in different assets:
60% low risk: BTC, ETH
30% mid risk: MidCaps like SOL, MATIC, ADA,…
10% high risk: memecoins, single purpose coins like AI (FET, OCEAN…)

In your case, make it 70%(BTC,ETH) / 30% (MidCaps)

Check out coinmarketcap for top10 coins.

AND! Very important: do not trust some guy on the internet ;) make your research and find a way you feel comfortable. Assets can drop hard and you should be able to cope with that.

Obviously utility coins made before the meme coin craze are stuck and grandfathered in with there boring branding .... likewise first generation meme coins are what they are ...

Rightly or wrongly, the retail community had shown a preference for memes, in buzz & press and growth, if not always in investment ""volume"". But that is changing meme coins are starting to over take many of the non-blue utility coins in Market cap.

"Kaspa!

Kaspa is considered a notable cryptocurrency for several reasons, primarily revolving around its innovative approach to blockchain technology and its unique consensus mechanism. Here are some key points:

1. **BlockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):** Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa uses a BlockDAG structure which allows for high throughput and rapid block generation. This structure can handle multiple blocks being created simultaneously without risking the integrity of the network.

2. **Fast Transaction Confirmation:** Kaspa's network can process transactions quickly due to its high block generation rate, leading to faster confirmation times compared to many other cryptocurrencies.

3. **Scalability:** The BlockDAG architecture contributes to Kaspa's scalability, making it more efficient at handling a high number of transactions per second (TPS) without congestion.

4. **Security:** Kaspa maintains robust security features inherent to blockchain technology while also introducing mechanisms that mitigate some common vulnerabilities. Its consensus algorithm ensures that even with rapid block creation, the network remains secure and decentralized.

5. **Fair Mining Process:** Kaspa employs a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism but with improvements that aim to create a fairer mining environment, reducing the likelihood of centralization.

6. **Active Development and Community Support:** Kaspa benefits from a dedicated development team and an active community. Continuous updates and improvements help keep the network resilient and responsive to emerging needs and challenges.

Overall, Kaspa's combination of rapid transaction processing, scalable architecture, and robust security makes it an appealing option in the cryptocurrency space.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWm5mTWdLeU83X0ZFMUdEU1E0TUdZbjlxc0xUeTFWSHFEemJoMXY5UnhuZEZwcHBrMlgybmV3eDRta2h0RGhYRHV5NXA4MlBoem1nMkxCVHM4SUxBXzhZbXJ0OVVORXVzOHBQMUNmRnI1S1U9

"Contrarian reactionary virtue doesn't do it for me but I guess I'll try.

First, Tara Reade was in fact readily believed upfront, out of respect for women and the movement, until it was demonstrated that her story was no longer believable and ran contrary to various good faith sources and fact checking. It's not been disproven, but it's highly suspect and Reade appears to have been influence for bad faith foreign actors. 

Two, *Believe All Women* never meant believe everything counter to the evidence provided about women. It's a slogan that simply asks people to respect people who make accusations of this nature, which was absolutely the case when Reade made her accusations. 

Three, the accusations against Kavanaugh, while not criminally proven, more than adequately demonstrated that he was not the least bit qualified for the job. There is simply is no reasoning yet provided to doubt the accusations provided, unlike with Reade's story. Reputation always matters in court of public opinion, by the way.

"For me, the Bitcoin.com wallet is okay for a mobile wallet, but I wouldn't use their exchange to actually buy crypto. While they are legit, there are better options out there with more coins available and better security practices. For buying, check out major players like Coinbase or Kraken. They are two beginner-friendly platforms for crypto. Still, no exchange is 100% safe from hacks or anything, but they have good records of protecting user funds. Make sure to do your research based on your preferences and country.

Now for what to actually buy. You got the right idea wanting to spread your bets around a bit. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the blue chips in this trading. These tokens have been around the longest and are generally considered the safest.

But tossing some money into a few different altcoins with potential is a smart strategy too. Maybe put like 60% into BTC/ETH, then divide the other 40% between 3-4 popular altcoins you've researched well.

I always make sure to read education websites like Investopedia and Traders Union when I am new to crypto.

"From what I can tell, the speculative hype drives a lot of traders to throw money at random meme coins with basically zero real-world use cases. It's almost like the actual technology and fundamentals don't even matter. Some people are just blindly chasing after the next lottery ticket.

But, I have this reading that this meme coin hype is not sustainable long-term. I was looking at some expert guides from the Traders Union website comparing the performance of meme coins in the markets. In every review, they stated the pros and cons of every popular meme coin that traders should seriously consider. The analysis suggests that while meme coins can have insane speculative runs fueled by hype, they tend to be extremely volatile and give back a lot of those gains over time.

In contrast, crypto projects with actual use cases and strong fundamentals may grow more slowly but increase in value more consistently as they get real-world adoption.

So in my view, this meme hype is probably just temporary. The market seems to go through these speculative moves every so often before the hype transitions to the next new trend. For long-term holds, I think the smart play is to focus on projects with solid utility and strong development teams behind them.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmN3h5OWZxY19oT0R3NzdqTVRyaEZlZUN6amNOZE41RjdEa3dIYzNNS244c19WLW1QV2hiLUZmbzdEQjNCU19LZzR1M3I4VXVmWWRvSEltLWs1UmxiSXc9PQ==

"Meme coins are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It captures market volatility and sentiments by swinging one way or another, and has the propensity to indulge those who are in the space only to ""get rich quickly"".  Nothing wrong with it but the blockchain technology, of which crypto is the inevitable by-product, is more than this. This is where utility coins come in and they are seldom glamorous unless it is the OG Bitcoin and Ethereum. As blockchain technology and its utility take time to develop, the market performance of utility coins is behind meme coins any day even when bullish undertones are not resent. Anyone who is looking to be involved in web3-related finance for the long run needs to focus on utility coins while short-term profit-booking is more the style of meme coin fans and fanatics. For example, I am a big follower of Oasis and its smart privacy utility.

This is indeed a crucial point in trading and after many yours of failing I can tell you this: Timing the market requires A LOT of learning and practicing. \\~80% of not-HODL-investors are losing money. So yes, it is absolutely normal, that your emotions overwhelm you.  
This is a basic problem to us humans. Trading requires a strict non-emotional approach but we are a (highly) emotional species, especially when it comes to money. This is the hard part.  
To get there, find your trading strategy. To execute a trade:   
- Set a limit Buy  
- Set a Limit Sell and Stop Loss  
- Let the trade run

Do not stare at the charts all day and enter or exit trades spontaneus. Plan ahead, think through it, execute, let it play out - get way from the screen.  
Focus on higher timeframes (1w, 1d, 4h), they will give you more time to analyse and plan.  
Before you invest real money, use papertrading (available on tradingview for example). Trade only on papertrading for at least one year. Write down your trades: What made you enter, what were the thoughts behind your TP and SL? When the trade has played out, analyse again: Why did it succeed, why not? Write down everything and read through it before you enter a new trade. Try to find your recourring mistakes and find a solution for it.

If your not willing to spend years of training and exercise, buy and hold. It saves you a lot of money and time.

"There are many strategies and all of them have pros and cons. The pro following this strategy is that even if you coin is down 50% you have only put in a fraction of your budget. Let's say you want to enter somewhere, the price is historically low as it is now, you put in 50% of your budget, at a 50% floating loss you'd are in the red by 25% of your budget, at some point the price hits the bottom, and you break even much earlier, when you have the funds to buy more at -50 or -70%. While others accumulated losses buy triggered stop losses.

No emotions. If you look at Interest rates they are almost risk free if you put money into a earn/savings account, so your profit, nearing the risk of floating losses should be above that. Say 10-20% for each position. Depends on your budget. If you put in 50% of your budget for one purchase you coul add sell orders at +10,+20,+30,+40,+50 and buy orders at -10,-20-,-30,-40,-50%.

When the volatility over more then 10% in a given time period you'd make 10% on the position or 1% of your total budget and after only three or four trades you already made more than putting it on a savings account.

If you do 100 trades in a given time period, you have doubled you money. At that time of your coin goes to 0 your are stil having the profit.

"Yeah sure. But 'if/when' that happens, Bitcoin will behave a lot like traditional stocks. It probably wouldn't do a +100% in one year anymore for example. I think BTC must first see a negative and catastrophic event to make it less of an emotional asset.

For now I guess people associate BTC too much with a risky asset (which it actually probably isn't right now - on the macro term of 1 at least).

"you can't time the market. over 90 percent of people who try will lose money trading. 

Successful traders have been in it a long time and they understand how to manage risk by setting appropriate stop loss and take profit orders at percentages of the trade in order that the wins outweigh the losses. They still make more loss trades than win trades, but their actual profits per trade outweigh the losses. 

They also study technical analysis of charts. They don't predict the future, they make a calculation of probabilities and trade appropriately. None of their trades depend on a 100 percent belief in the market moving in one direction.

Personally I use grid trading bots that I wrote myself in python and use the exchanges api to high frequency trade. It's profitable in sideways markets but stops running in bull or bear markets. This is the least risky trading method but it's lots of tiny profits that add up over time rather than chasing the big returns.

"yes you can do this by creating a token on a network with low fees. There are several YouTube videos to do this. I think solana was the cheapest at some point so most tutorials are for solana. This is by far the easiest option and if you can find a cheap layer2 solution on ethereum you can create the actual token in a few lines of solidity code, or find a web solution that you can use to create the token for you. then its a case of students downloading metamask to manage the tokens.

The problem is you want a cheap/free method so that students aren't paying fees each time they transfer tokens. Most of the chains will be at least a few pence per transaction and the fee won't be predictable. Solana went from under a cent for a transaction to much higher once the chain gained popularity.

In that case you need to set up your own blockchain. It's more complicated but not impossible. Amazon aws has tutorials on how to set up a blockchain in an aws instance that you control... so the actual transactions will be completely free as you are setting up a single node which will verify all the transactions. (I am assuming you dont need the security of several nodes) [https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/)

You can also code a simple blockchain from scratch in python which could run in the cloud (or find a GitHub of a pre written code) but then you also have to code the website or app to manage peoples funds in a wallet of some kind  and it could get complicated quickly...

Coding a blockchain is actually really simple and a lot easier than people think. It's just a few lines of python code to make a very basic blockchain that handles transactions, and a good learning experience to try it. I made my own version in a couple of hours and ran it in the cloud. obviously the more complex the blockchain and the more functions it has,  the larger the code.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmdk1BMlJwOEFpV3FvTFl2QjhaV2ZweHB0V2RPcWk1Wk80cHdJUktWa0hBd1BiYjdrN2pQeVp1SmdXSnB2OUlEQnFCWHZON0tEOXY2TFFReS1EbWt3emc9PQ==

Smartlink - web3 marketplace.

and Etherlink is an actually decentralised Layer 2 EVM (Ethereum-style) network that's faster and cheaper than existing networks, doesn't require an L2 token. Because it supports solidity there could be a big increase in dapps coming to Tezos.

Tezos is about to have a major upgrade next week which will introduce adaptive inflation, increase the % of staked tezos (reducing sell supply) and reduce block time to 10 seconds.

"In order of biggest to smallest bags:

SOL
NEAR
LINK
AERO
ASI (Altsignals not FET- the OG ASI)
UNISWAP
PAAL AI
BRETT

My bags are following my 2 favorite narratives (SOL is not really married to either narrative, but I believe that SOL will climb the market cap ranks to an even higher level once we get thru next altcoin season. And similar logic applies to UNI who is the undisputed Dex king in crypto and I think UNI price will reflect this sentiment)

1) BASE network is going to run this place in a couple of years. Maybe sooner  
*Aerodrome is the choice dex for Base
*Brett will be Base's top Meme coin when it's all said and done 

2) Support for my favorite AI projects.    
*PAAL AI: go explore their community and developing ecosystem and you'll see why
*NEAR: NEAR has been at this for so long and finally we're seeing one of the most well oiled protocols available in the AI space.  Performance wise, NEAR passes the smell test every which way you slice it and is trending to be one AIs biggest beneficiaries of AI narrative during altseason
*LINK- the #1 oracle in space where Oracles will be huge for crypto. Not to mention the importance of connecting blockchains to real-world assets is something that I think will be critical for the performance of the many Crypto AI players
*Altsignals: whether you believe in the use of AI protocols creating buy sell signals for traders or not, it's incredibly clear that this functionality will eventually become ubiquitous in crypto trading circles. It's genuinely a well run company too.

Wallet addresses are one of those things which seem simple enough if you've been around crypto a good while, but they're insanely complicated to most, and a lot of folks just avoid touching it altogether. 

This should really make it a lot simpler and encourage a lot more people to use wallets in the first place as well as letting people in on a lot more off-CEX tokens.

[https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/cryptocurrency/articles/the-new-head-of-ccompliance-at-binance/](https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/cryptocurrency/articles/the-new-head-of-ccompliance-at-binance/)

  
"" **1 February 2024**

Binance has appointed Lesley O’Neill as its new chief compliance officer in the United States.

O’Neill, who was previously chief compliance officer at the digital identity verification platform Prove Identity, will now head Binance’s attempts to enhance its compliance in the wake of its resolutions with the US Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Foreign Assets Control,  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Those resolutions saw the company agree to pay $4.3 billion for huge compliance failures. The settlement, however, provides Binance with an opportunity to at least rebuild trust with customers. That could prove vital for a company that pleaded guilty to criminal charges brought by the DOJ for evading [sanctions](https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/sanctions/) and ignoring [anti-](https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/anti-money-laundering-investigations/a-brief-summary-of-money-laundering-and-how-to-respond-to-allegations/)[money laundering](https://www.rahmanravelli.co.uk/expertise/anti-money-laundering-investigations/a-brief-summary-of-money-laundering-and-how-to-respond-to-allegations/) rules, had to face a raft of civil settlements and was excluded from the US market.

O’Neill’s role could prove pivotal in that challenge, bearing in mind that Binance has to complete a five-year compliance monitorship with FinCen and a three-year one with the DOJ. If these are completed and Binance’s compliance programme is considered to be of suitable standard, the company should be able to re-enter the US market.

Binance reached its settlements in the shadow of the huge FTX scandal. As a result, it stood to benefit if it could portray its failings as compliance failures rather than anything of a more serious nature that was worthy of criminal prosecution.

The appointment of O’Neill can be seen as a large piece of the jigsaw that Binance now has to put together to convince the authorities - and all interested parties and current and potential customers – that it is back on track.

The monitorships that Binance has to complete are the first of a kind and include very detailed compliance requirements. If its new head of compliance can steer it through these, the long-term prospects for Binance will look bright. ""

"""The guidance requires firms that custody crypto to record customer crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets, which critics say could prevent banks from safeguarding digital assets.""

This is a good thing for crypto, because it makes it slightly harder for crypto custodians (which are like banks) to do ""fractional reserve crypto"" which is the kind of BS that fiat banks do that inspired the creation of crypto to begin with.

"I'm experienced both with the traditional markets as well as the crypto market as well, I have repeatedly doing really well with both, due to the fact that I study a lot and I'm conducting really good analysis.

Your initial capital is small so I would suggest you to buy 1/3 Pepe , 1/3 Wif and 1/3 Brett.

Expect at least a total return between 600-900%.

I'm deadly serious regarding the three coins above and I have already done more than 20X or 40X lots of times.

I don't ask anything in return, I really like to help in general and I believe it's the least I could do, if I take account that our generation struggles to make ends meet worldwide.

I wish you truly the best and after you cash out the 7 or 10k + I would suggest you to buy VOO+ QQQM+ SCHD with an equal analogy.

That way you maximised your initial capital and then you invested wisely to ETFs with the safest risk/reward ratio, securing both your investments and also  at the same time diversifying to the 🏆 winners !

More or less after 6.43 years your initial 7 or 10K will be 14 or 20K and if you choose to keep dripping your dividends back to the initial capital it will keep compounding and growing bigger..

But you can use revolut or something like that but keep in mind that you're not actually trading stocks, you lend money to buy stocks. No fees but no ownership. This means that if you hold Tesla on revolut or robinhood you can only sell/buy there which might make it deviate from the actual stock price on wall street because they are one side of a market maker on the real exchange.

I have about 270 in crypto...once it hits a 1000 i'm off to forex or fake stocks with margin trades. Crypto is not for putting in a lot of money, it's a calculated gamble to make a lot from a bit.

"A smartass answer would be ""the ones I've never heard of,"" but I haven't been following crypto as closely in the last year or so as I have in the previous 5 or 6. 

But I did a cursory search on each of them, and this is my gut reaction. Note that I think ""shitcoins"" should be avoided, but that doesn't necessarily mean I endorse the ""legit"" ones, it's just that my barely-researched gut reaction isn't that they're gonna steal everyone's money in an exit scam. And that's based on the content of their website, lifetime price action, available trading pairs, number of exchanges, coin/token distribution, and their CMC ranking.

(note: as I started looking at this, something's come up. If I remember, I'll come back tomorrow and do a little digging on the rest)

I could say the exact same about you. But hey, instead of poor rambling, blind hate, and acting like a triggered insecure incel in diapers, why not just  look at the objectives and facts:  

Economy is best, lowest unemployment, stock market high as never before, under Trump the debts exploded and the consequence was a high inflation shortly after, gas prices are down (when they were up, of course, it was Biden's fault, lol), Global GDP share is highest, innovation up, US reputation is great again (no one would take a president  serious who stinks, is a rapist, convicted felon, and that's why Putin still loves his puppet Trump, Taliban rule Afghanistan again thanks to Trump, the world does not laugh about the stupid former govt anymore, and so on).  

What positive can you say about Trump? Nothing I guess, and that's why you neither refuted my crypto arguments nor posted any other examples. Only lame ad hominem attacks in the words of a 12 yr old.

It's only getting back at our banks if we can prevent the govt. From controlling it the way they have controlled banking. In the UK I've heard of their govt. Telling the citizens that they can only spend a certain amount weekly determined by the govt. So we have to watch out for that kind of control.

"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency that can be transferred via the bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by an unknown individual or group of individuals using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. ([1](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **It's Decentralized**
> 
> * Decentralization is the process through which an organization's operations are disseminated or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group, specifically those related to decision-making and planning ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Decentralization)). One of the core assets of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized meaning:
> 
> 1. No need for a central authority
> 2. No need for centralized servers (peer to peer network)
> 3. Ledger is distributed and public
> 4. Anyone can be a bitcoin miner
> 5. Anyone can create a bitcoin address
> 6. Anyone can do a transaction without needing approval from a centralized source
> 
> **Provides Privacy**
> 
> * Bitcoin is a pseudonymous currency, which means that funds are not connected to real-world entities but rather to bitcoin addresses. If you were to own a bitcoin address, there would be no known connection between your identity and that of the address but all transactions will be public. Although it is possible (but hardly) that bad actors may identify your address via correlating the transactions you made, you can increase privacy by creating another address.
> 
> **Security**
> 
> * Bitcoin operates through what is called a Proof of Work algorithm which is a type of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) demonstrates to others (the verifiers) that a specific amount of computational effort has been expended. In Bitcoin, miners compete to append blocks and mint new currency, each miner experiencing a success probability proportional to the computational effort expended. Miners in Bitcoin are tasked to validate a transaction by solving a complex problem. The total combined total computational power of these miners combines is what's called a Hashrate. The hashrate is an important metric for assessing the security of the network. The more machines dedicated to discovering the next block by honest miners, the higher the hashrate rises and the more difficult it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network. ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), [4](https://etherplan.com/2020/03/21/why-proof-of-work-based-nakamoto-consensus-is-secure-and-complete/10509/), [5](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/))
> 
> **Scarcity**
> 
> * There will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence, once all of Bitcoin has been mined there will no more issuance of new Bitcoins and this give it this certain trait of scarcity like precious metals without the difficulty of portability and also the same traits of durability. ([5](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp), [6](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/))
> 
> **The Coin that Started it All**
> 
> * By this time everybody knows why and how Bitcoin, how it's mysterious maker just vanished from the scene and how it's purpose still echoes as a reminder that power of self-custody is never too late to remove ourselves from being too dependent of centralized bodies that often times go beyond what we allow them to do. To this day, Bitcoin still stands as number one coin (by marketcap) and will probably stay that way for a very long time.

"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> # Bitcoin, could it be wrong. ""Are we the bad guys ?"" 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> In this small write up, I am going to delve into con-arguments against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the flagship of cryptocurrencies but there are a lot of criticism that could be leveraged against Bitcoin. First of all, let's delve into a small presentation of Bitcoin. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: An introduction. 
> 
> Bitcoin is the biggst cryptocurrency. It was created by a mysterious figure. The creation of Bitcoin is a strange and mysterious  mystery. No one knows who created Bitcoin.  
>   
> Bitcoin was started as a way to circumvent traditional banking. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology. Blockchain can be seen as an open book allowing anyone to know where is each fraction of Bitcoin ever.  
>   
> This blockchain is maintained through computer power. In a vulgar way: Bitcoin is mined by solving math problems. The maths problem becomes harder when more people are mining so that mining takes a fixed amount of time according to a timeline known to everyone. In order to respect this timeline, mining rewards are halved every few years.  
>   
> Since anyone who wants to validate transactions is forced to complete a very hard math problem (which becomes harder the more people are mining), no one can cheat in new transactions. Also, every other miner has a copy of the blockchain. Through making sure that no entity has 50% of the mining, you can stop nefarious actors from changing the blockchain.  
>   
> This is using cryptographic technology that I don't yet understand but you can read more about it here:  
>   
> Bitcoin Wikipedia  
>   
> Without delving more into the tech side of bitcoin. Which can also be explained through youtube videos here: Bitcoin explained  
>   
> The Metrics of Bitcoin are currently: 22400$ Per coin for a Market cap of 430 Bilions and a daily volume of 19 Billions. Bitcoin was shortly valued at 69000 usd during the ATH.  
>   
> Now let's dive into what is making Bitcoin so bad.
> 
> # Permissionless: A senseless destruction of world order. 
> 
> Bitcoin is a project existing in a very delicate world balanced by power structure. While we can be happy that the current top dog is the US (yes they are not perfect BUT they could be worse) we know that someone else could be on top. Despite that, we should strive to use the current US dominance to curb rogue states into the world order. 
> 
> The current war in Ukraine is a demonstration of the world order crumbling to maintain itself. I'd argue, the rise of cryptocurrencies may be a part of this crumbling. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that, Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar would usher a chaotic age of international relation. 
> 
> The world has shrank a lot since the rise of internet. The fact is that the stability of the world is much more precious than ever. Everyone can see what happens in any other country and how the supply chains which guarantee our comfort are of the utmost importance. YET, we are pushing forward a great disrupter of balance. 
> 
> Permissionless can help terrorists, permissionless can help crime. YES traditionnal banking is doing it already BUT I'd argue that the absence of regulator and watchdog to make the current system comply is not an argument in favor of a tech which will make regulation and surveillance harder. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: This MONEY Doesn't Work, This Money Doesn't WORK. 
> 
> Bitcoin is claiming to be a currency. A viable alternative to fiat money. But anyone with a neuron or two could realize that the fluctuation in the value of Bitcoin is crazy. Some pedentic nerd and bitcoin maximalist could argue that 1 BTC = 1 BTC BUT if you don't know how much you'll need to put food on the table then BTC is not working as a currency. Yes inflation is lowering the value of Fiat BUT fiat doesn't see wild swings of + or -  30 % in most economies. 
> 
> While not being really MONEY I'd argue that Bitcoin doesn't WORK. To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account. This movement has created economic vitality. Bitcoin, most of the time, is seen as an investment vehicle such as gold. I'd argue that these vehicle are not valuable for society since the freeze money in place. 
> 
> In a bank, your money is working. Instead of Bitcoin, people should be paid more by banks to put their money in investment portfolios since these provide the liquidity necessary to make the economy work. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Bitcoin: A very big spending of energy. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Bitcoin is a project which is wasting a lot of ressource for something which is not making a lot of sense. While Bitcoin is using more and more green energy, I'd argue that it is still a big waste. Subsidies could prop up the green sector far better than the mining farms that go with windfarms. 
> 
> Seeing Bitcoin as one of the biggest leverage of the green sector is a non-sense. Optimization of the energy sector means that the variable production should allow to reduce the use of fossil energy. Not allow to waste energy in a senseless project. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: The harsh truth is, we may be the bad guys. 
> 
> Partaking in an economic sector which allows for a disruption of world order, which doesn't help the economy and which is wasting energy may not be beneficial. This is why Bitcoin should not be seen as a messiah of economic proportion but as something which should raise criticism and should be heavily regulated. 
> 
> Good luck in your investments.

"#Solana Pro-Arguments
Below is a Solana pro-argument written by a deleted user.

> #PROs
> 
> This is the Pros section of [my analysis on Solana](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/vk42tn/solana_research_june_2022/)
> 
> ##Low Transaction Fees
> 
> Solana has very low transaction fees at about $0.0002 / transaction. They could still increase the fee schedule by ~40x before exceeding penny in cost. That's mainly because the fees are subsidized by staking rewards paid to powerful validators, which then contribute to ongoing SOL token [inflation of ~7%](https://messari.io/screener/supply-and-marketcap-EB1755C2) as of 2022.
> 
> ##Moderately-high TPS
> 
> The true TPS limit of Solana over the past year after subtracting invalid transactions and vote transactions is [about 400-600](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/cc7a0d94-7f70-46f4-aae4-2f8810430931#theme=night). It's not anywhere close to their marketed throughput of 50K TPS, but it's still moderately-high for a smart contract network.
> 
> ##Centralization is not as bad as the reputation
> 
> Solana has a very bad reputation for being centralized as **SQL**ana. It's actually not that centralized. There are currently 1900 validators, and the Nakamoto Consensus for shutting down the Solana network (needs 33% staked) is [currently 33 validators](https://solanabeach.io/validators).
> 
> On the other hand, there's almost no information about the identity of these validators, so it's still possible they're mostly centrally-owned by the foundation. We just don't know.
> 
> ##Outage and stability issues likely to be resolved by 2 upcoming updates
> 
> The days of making fun of Solana for their outages could be coming to an end. Solana is working on [2 major updates](https://decrypt.co/103106/solana-new-gas-fees) that are meant to mitigate outages and provide stability to the network.
> 
> **QUIC** replaces UDP for Solana's IP and Transport layer protocols. [QUIC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) provides flow control, allowing nodes to throttle incoming traffic when there's too much from both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks.
> 
> **Localized Fee Prioritization** allows Solana to dynamically charge higher fees for specific high-demand transactions. When a dApp or NFT project is congesting the network, the fee will rise for that app without affecting the rest of the network. This is a really cool solution I'd love to see other networks copy.
> 
> ##Lots of DeFi projects
> 
> There are a ton of DeFi projects on Solana. It has 39 DeFi projects above $1M in TVL. [DeFiLlama shows Solana at $1.4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), which puts it between Tron and Arbitrum at #6.

"#Solana Con-Arguments
Below is a Solana con-argument written by Nostalg33k.

> # Solana: A tale of broken trust and VCs 
> 
> Solana, an infamous name living as the shadow of it former self [Currently hovering at a price a bit higher than 10% of the ATH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/) which is a shame for any investor. In this small analysis we are going to discuss why Solana is a failure on multiple fronts. From Security, to stability. Let's delve into Solana. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # From outages to outrages
> 
> Solana has been transformed into a laughingstock by the repeating outages the network has known. While it is claimed that [Solana is all about speed, with 400 millisecond block times. And as hardware gets faster, so does the network.](https://Solana.com) The Solana network has suffered [6 outages in the month of January](https://fortune.com/2022/01/25/solana-founder-anatoly-yakovenko-crypto-crash-blockchain-instability/) Stability has not been the strong suit of the network. This has sparked outrage against the network but ALSO against some exchanges because these outages are leading big dumps on the markets: [When speculator sell and lead to a 12 % dump](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/solana-suffered-its-second-outage-in-a-month-sending-price-plunging.html) the most dedicated investor are left holding their bags on the blockchain. 
> 
> Every discussion about Solana as an investment should discuss the possibility of outages and swings. 
> 
> # The Main Use case is Bullshit
> 
> The main use case for Solana is to sell useless no common sense NFTs. While there are good use case for NFT technology, art and music nfts as they exist are just a passing fad and will need to evolve or disappear. Being a place linked mainly with this technology is very risky and shows a devotion to speculation and not to common sense use cases. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Security: Hacks, hacks, hacks and VCs
> 
> The Solana ecosystem has known a lot of failures. The fact is that value is on the ETH side of the crypto ecosystem so bridges are required. When the Wormhole bridge saw a hack leading to 120000 ETH being minted out of the bridge leading to a loss which would be currently valued at 160 Millions. 
> 
> When this happened Jump Crypto, a subsidiary from Jump Capital, found 320 Millions to buy ETH and replace the missing funds. This allows us to understand two possibilities.
> 
> 1) Jump Crypto did this from the kindness of their heart  
> 
> 2) Jump Crypto did this because they are heavily invested in Solana and control a large part of the SOL moving around.
> 
> Now this may be speculation BUT recently Jump Crypto was said to be working to overhaul the open source SOL protocol for nodes. This leads to doubt about the legitimacy of the Solana Fundation and who controls the project. 
> 
> [https://protos.com/jump-crypto-forced-to-save-solana-with-320m-bailout-of-its-own-company/](https://protos.com/jump-crypto-forced-to-save-solana-with-320m-bailout-of-its-own-company/)

> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: A lacking use case, a profit motive from VCs and a past of lacking security and stability must lead you to high caution. 
> 
> VCs are here to make money and they must be holding bags of Solana. If you buy some SOL you are putting yourself into their games and are now dancing with them. While NFT is the future for so many reasons (intellectual property, administration and so much more) the current use case are laughable and security will be at the forefront of gouvernements or IP management companies sending patents through your blockchain. 
> 
> Being seen as an Eth killer, Solana is far from making the cut. I'd advise extreme caution. Please don't get burn't by this project.

"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chysce which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> In its essence Ethereum is a platform that allows developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts. These contracts are self-executing and run automatically when certain conditions are met which makes them transparent and secure. With the recent [Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)  Ethereum has switched from proof of work to proof of stake which made the network even more secure and decentralized.
> 
> **>> Deflationary Future**
> 
> As a result of the Ethereum Merge event, the ETH tokenomics are now set up to become **deflationary.** For example only during last month supply of ETH decreased by [31.5k ETH](https://ultrasound.money/)  due to more ETH being burned than issued. If Ethereum can consistently ramp up its user base and transactions over time, it will move closer to a deflationary future, which is increasingly likely given the growing DeFi and gaming ecosystems. The more transactions and people using ETH, the more it gets burned, which should theoretically make ETH more valuable going forward. Current supply decrease is  [0.319% per year](https://ultrasound.money/) and the burn and is bound to increase with the use.
> 
> **>> Staking**
> 
> The upcoming [Shanghai Fork](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-7099021) will make liquidity readily available to stakers at any time, enabling them to have financial flexibility to build on top of it, as opposed to locking their ETH for extended periods. By staking ETH, one can manage it independently, with the assurance that no one can default on their investments, as it is secured on a smart contract. Since the start of staking program there has been a consistent rise in the [amount of staked Ethereum](https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/eth2/total-value-staked?window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line). Currently [\\~15% of total supply](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/)  of ETH is staked and [APR is 4.5%](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/)
> 
> **>> ETH is a DeFi powerhouse**
> 
> Ethereum is the biggest platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. The vast majority of DeFi applications are built on Ethereum, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, and stablecoins. Ethereum's popularity, tools and resources that are available to developers have significantlu contributed to the growth of DeFi on the platform.
> 
> While other blockchain platforms are also entering the DeFi space ETH will always have the first mover advantage and will be very hard to replace. [At the moment the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi on Ethereum (58%) is greater than the  TVL of all other blockchain platforms combined](https://defillama.com/chains)
> 
> **>> Active Community**
> 
> Compared to other ecosystems Ethereum has [the biggest and most active community](https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-has-most-developers-but-these-newer-chains-are-growing-fast). It has  the largest total number of developers, and this number is continuously increasing.  Ethereum's community is known for being open-minded, welcoming, and inclusive. They are also very active in discussing and implementing future improvements

"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by lj26ft which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Ethereum is being shown favoritism and privilege by US regulators. This is the biggest con for Ethereum. Early promoters of Ethereum approached and worked closely with the SEC to shield it from any securities laws. The arguments used by the SEC in the Ripple case can be more easily applied to Ethereum. 
> 
> Why does Ethereum get a free pass from creating a securities offering? Because Joe Lubin started the Brooklyn project before Ethereum even launched. There's multiple threads on this very sub that shows they sold it to more than just developers. I find the hypocrisy and corruption to be the biggest con argument for Ethereum. It's being chosen by the incumbent system as the only standard for web3 so far. I don't think Ethereum would be as highly valued or trusted if it didn't have carte blanche on illegal fundraising/ hosting tens of thousands of illegal securities offerings. 
> 
> The market needs to be a level playing field and right now it's heavily tilted towards Ethereum because of financial interests of early promoters, conflicts of interests from US regulators and their financial interests in Ethereum.

"#Avalanche Pro-Arguments
Below is a Avalanche pro-argument written by a deleted user.

> Avalanche is a relatively-new (only 1.5 years old) multi-blockchain crypto project whose token, AVAX, shot up into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap in just 1 year. It has since fallen a bit.
> 
> It has 3 chains on its primary network (C-Chain, X-Chain, P-Chain) and many subnets. The C-Chain is the most-used chain and almost the only one that's used by exchanges.
> 
> I have a separate summary of [Avalanche here](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/ukjt2e/avalanche_research_summary/) that discusses the platform in more detail.
> 
> This post only lists the PROs
> 
> ##PROs
> 
> * The C-Chain uses an account model for transactions and is EVM-compatible. So it's easy for devs to create apps that bridge between EVM-compatible networks.
> * The C-Chain EVM has many optimizations which make it much more gas-efficient than Ethereum. Most smart contract transactions cost pennies on the Avalanche network.
> 	
> **Low Transaction Costs**
> 
> * C-Chain basic transactions (e.g. transfers/swaps) currently [$.03-$.10](https://snowtrace.io/gastracker) after the Crabada DeFi game moved to its subnet. This is way cheaper than using Ethereum (both before and after The Merge). Like Ethereum, the C-Chain also spam-resistant due to variable transaction fees. When the network was 30% congested while Crabada was running on the C-Chain, transaction fees were still only between $0.30 to $1.5 to execute.
> * X-Chain and P-Chain transaction fees are fixed at a low [0.001 AVAX](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/transaction-fees/), which are currently $0.05 - $0.10 USD (Apr 2022). Both are spam-resistant because you'd need to spend over $1M USD / hour in transaction fees before they start seeing congestion.
> * However, note that transaction fees are kept artificially low because validators are paid by staking rewards, which creates high inflation (over 10%) on the circulating supply.
> 
> **High performance and speed**
> 
> * **Extremely fast finality**: All 3 primary chains have an extremely-fast [1-2 second deterministic finality](https://docs.avax.network/build/tutorials/platform/integrate-exchange-with-avalanche/). Avalanche uses Snow, which is a fast BFT-like consensus protocol that uses a DAG structure for network gossip. Most other BFT-class blockchains have a moderately-slower 4-10s finality time.
> * **Moderately-fast TPS**:
> 	* **C-Chain**: Highest achieved TPS was [869](https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/c-chain-activity/) on the C-Chain, which accounts for over 99% of Avalanche transactions. This is already 50x higher than Ethereum's maximum TPS of ~16 TPS. The maximum TPS depends on the type of smart contracts it sees (300 bytes on average). Currently, the Avalanche C-Chain is only seeing [10-40 TPS](https://snowtrace.io/chart/tx) because it doesn't get that many transaction requests. These are mostly from the Crabada game that's going to move into its own subnet.
> 	* **X-Chain**: This is often quoted to be the 4500 TPS network of Avalanche (though it's quite misleading because this chain gets very little usage compared to the C-Chain). The X-Chain uses UTXO transactions and does not support smart contracts, so it's best compared to the Bitcoin network. 4500 TPS is orders of magnitude faster than Bitcoin's 5-7 TPS. In ideal test situations (150 nodes, 10kb blocks), the X-Chain can get [up to 7000 TPS](https://assets.website-files.com/5d80307810123f5ffbb34d6e/6009805681b416f34dcae012_Avalanche%20Consensus%20Whitepaper.pdf).
> 	* **P-Chain**: The P-Chain is very similar to the X-Chain. Its purpose is for governance, staking, validators, and subnet management. Its 4500 TPS limit is way more than it will ever need.
> * **High uptime**: Avalanche's primary network has had no outages. Aside from a brief minting bug in Feb 2022, it has not experienced any noticeable congestion.
> 
> **Supports Application-Specific sidechains: Subnets**
> 
> In addition, Avalanche uses subnets to build application-specific blockchains that connect weakly to its ecosystem.
> 
> * Subnets allows communities to create their own flexible sidechains that are loosely connected to the Avalanche's primary network. Subnets gain access to Avalanches infrastructure and framework, but not its security. They can have their own consensus model, decide the requirements for validators, be public or private, and have their own native token for transaction fees.
> * Subnet validators must validate the Primary network, which in turns validates the 3 built-in networks. As the number of subnets grow, they will contribute to the overall security and decentralization of Avalanche's primary network (but not vice-versa).

"#Avalanche Con-Arguments
Below is a Avalanche con-argument written by MDot_Cartier.

> Seems to me like avalanche which was delayed by a sophisticated Ddos attack right off the bat is also going to be vulnerable to the same type of governance attack that allowed a hacker to steal $80 million dollars from beanstalk in mid april by using a flash loan which allowed him to buy a majority stake in beanstalk, and change the rules to send the $80 million to his account  all within 13 seconds. If avalanche wants to be the backbone of multiple networks it needs to prove it is secure and I'm not sure it has done that to this point in time.

"#DEX Pro-Arguments
Below is a DEX pro-argument written by excalilbug.

> The biggest advantage of Decentralized Exchanges is already mentioned in the name – they are **decentralized**. What does it exactly mean? If an exchange is truly decentralized it:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * Does not store your assets or personal data = it is **private** and people control their funds. You yourself are responsible for your finances
> * There is no one individual or small group of individuals who have full control of the exchange and there is no one point of failure = just like in (healthy) democracy everyone has a say in every decision and the **exchange can't be shut down so easily** (because its ""servers"" are spread around the world)
> * There is **free access** = you don't have to go through KYC, so not only it is more private than centralized exchanges but also no one can stop you from accessing the exchange from anywhere you live. No KYC also keeps you **save from personal data leaks**. If CEX is hacked, your personal data might be leaked. And since you upload your ID there together with a lot of personal data such leaks are very dangerous
> * There are **no middlemen** = all transactions are made directly between buyers and sellers
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> The last point gives decentralized crypto exchanges a big advantage because – let's be honest – what people care most about is not decentralization or privacy – it is money. By removing the middleman DEXes can take much **lower fees**. DEXes can also save money on customer support, lawyer teams, marketing and many other things. That is why using DEXes is usually cheaper. Of course it all depends on liquidity of assets. But with time – as DEXes become easier to use and more popular (hopefully) – the liquidity will stop being a problem for most assets
> 
> And it is hard to overstate the other important aspect of decentralized exchanges – **TRANSPARENCY**.
> 
> Centralized Exchanges - especially the big ones – can manipulate the market. For example today most trades take place on Binance. This is very, very bad. Because if Binance isn't transparent (and it isn't) it can easily manipulate the market when it generates as much as 70% of total volume (n the case of Bitcoin Binance exchange is responsible for 98% of all spot trading volume - [https://cryptoslate.com/binance-takes-over-98-of-all-bitcoin-spot-trading-volume/](https://cryptoslate.com/binance-takes-over-98-of-all-bitcoin-spot-trading-volume/) \\- whenever I'm reminded of Binance dominance I just wish it was Binance that collapsed instead of FTX. The market would crash much harder but in long term it could be very positive – see: Mt Gox).
> 
> In the case of DEXes everyone is equal. Everyone can see all the trades that were made. Everyone can see market orders. **Everyone has the same data available**. CEXes can give only part of that data or even hide much of it. Then they can use it to their advantage (market manipulation, inside trading).
> 
> Another important thing we need to remember is that Decentralized Exchanges are still a new concept. This might of course mean that it will all go to trash. But I prefer to think positively – I believe that there are many incredible **innovations awaiting us** and the concept of DEX and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) will succeed. I believe there will be many talented developers and visionaries who will come up with wonderful ideas and more and more people will start using DEXes. Eventually all centralized exchanges (both crypto and traditional) will be finally challenged and there will be more balance in the world of finance…  
> Let's keep our fingers crossed
> 
> **TL;DR** – no middleman, no KYC, no centralized power who can freeze your assets whenever it wants, privacy, transparency, lower fees, innovative, the more popular, the more secure, can bring more balance to the world of finance, harder to manipulate the market because everyone has access to the same amount of information

"#DEX Con-Arguments
Below is a DEX con-argument written by Nostalg33k.

> # DEX: A contradiction to mass adoption. 
> 
> DEXes are a big part of the crypto economy, yet they have a lot of problems. I will present the main problems with dexes: The complexity of the legal ramifications, the liquidity problems and finally the lack of on-ramp system. 
> 
> # Introduction: 
> 
> Decentralized exchanges are systems allowing people to directly swap a cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. 
> 
> Main examples include PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, UniSwap and RcpSwap. These platforms mostly work through Liquidity providers (LP) and Yield Farming through transactions fees. 
> 
> While they can be usefull depending on your use of cryptocurrencies, they can also have issues which aren't going to be fixed anytime soon. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 1) The obvious legal problems
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> There are obvious legal problems inherent to P2P trading. You don't know who will be using your P2P system. Since Dexes don't comply with KYC they can work with unlawful parties such as but not limited with sanctionned countries, organized crime, terrorists, hackers and your shady government officials. 
> 
> As a liquidity provider, are your lending your money to offer trading services? Are you offering banking services to people if you allow them to lend money to others. There are far reaching implications raised by Dexes. One can only wonder how long until they are regulated out of existence because they seem like the dark alley of the crypto space. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # 2) Liquidity providers, the true bag holding strategy. 
> 
> Liquidity providers are the key to the inner working of Dexes. In order to have enough tokens to allow trading, you need to have enough liquidity in both sides of the pair. Obviously you can use more complex paths (A token for B, B for C and C for D when the custommer wanted to do A to D) if there is no liquidity in a given pair. 
> 
> Liquidity providers can see a pool be drained of one side of the tokens and the other side can depreciate leaving people with massive losses. 
> 
> Lastly a pool can be drained because of an exploit. 
> 
> All these risks are faced solely by the liquidity providers. While CEXes are also vulnerable to exploits, they are more safely managed through assurance and reserves in multiple assets (non crypto assets) 
> 
> # 3) Dexes will never popularize enough. 
> 
> Dexes are a niche tool, yes they have a looooot of value locked in their liquidity pools BUT a lot of our tokens aren't really liquid (Spoiler: there is not a trillion dollars in crypto currencies, the market cap is far from reflecting the liquidity of our assets). I'd argue that their big numbers are a trap. They are actually incapable of becoming popular for the common man. 
> 
> Most people will not want to have to go through multiple plateforms to check prices and liquidity; they don't want to worry about slippage and they just want a smooth experience. 
> 
> While CEX are not protecting them from these problems, they allow for a smooth ride and for people without technical knowledge to buy and send cryptocurrencies. 
> 
> The lack of on-ramp to transform USD or EUR into crypto is the final nail in a sturdy coffin. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: DEXes are only good for power users. 
> 
> I'd argue that in this small essay I haven't provided reason to turn your back to Dexes. But the lack of simplicity means that the average investor may not need to know much about Dexes and can stay using CEX and their own wallet to really own their crypto (not your seed not your coins) 
> 
> If you have to use a DEX ask yourself, could you do the same in a CEX? If the answer is yes, then most people in your situation would prefer the simplicity of a CEX.

"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by a deleted user which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by a deleted user which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> ####**Intro**
> 
> Overall, Bitcoin's conservative blockchain has failed to keep up technologically with other blockchains. Bitcoin is currently #1 not due to better design, but because it had a first-mover advantage. But how long will that hold?
> 
> Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency. Many crypto enthusiasts often started out with Bitcoin and then branched out. Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**
> 
> **Poor Medium of Exchange**
> 
> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days.
> 
> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny.
> 
> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**.
> 
> **Unstable Store of Value**
> 
> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market.
> 
> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**
> 
> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin.
> 
> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**
> 
> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself.
> 
> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**
> 
> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested.
> 
> **Not a true Layer 2**
> 
> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible.
> 
> **Meant for small transactions**
> 
> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). 
> 
> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**
> 
> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized.
> 
> **Channels require rebalancing**
> 
> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical ""full cup of water"". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity.
> 
> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity.
> 
> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**
> 
> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority.
> 
> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017.
> 
> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/).
> 
> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency.
> 
> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**
> 
> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage.
> 
> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)].
> 
> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security.
> 
> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**
> 
> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare for them to be auditing their pool operators and won't notice attacks until it's too late.
> 
> This could be fixed with **Stratum v2**, but that's not available yet. And we don't even know if mining pools will enable the configuration t...

"Well what is ""significant profit"" to you?  A 10x would put you at $3,500.  If you put it all in Bitcoin, btc would have to reach $680,000 for you to 10x.  

Can bitcoin reach $680k this cycle?  I guess it ""could"".  Doubt it though.  You would prob need to hodl until 2029 for that return.  That's approx 5 years to make $3k...

You have to consider market caps with your roi expectations.  When you hear stories of someone throwing just a couple hundred into a token & getting rich it's b/c they bought when the project had a very low market cap.  Which is high risk & can just as easily go to zero.

Of the cryptos you listed your best bet would probably be Chainlink.  Link will almost definitely 10x from here this cycle.  But if you're really looking to make significant profit you will prob need to hodl until 2029.  Just b/c you don't have much invested to begin with.

"The problem is the scammers spend a lot of time gaining their trust 1st.  They're pros.  There's entire buildings of these scammers in places like Dubai.

They have it down to a science.  Know where/how to find victims.  How to gain their trust.  It's usually a combo of loneliness/depression, then love/lust & good ole greed.

Pig butchering is prob at least 95% of these scams.  Have seen a few where the victims thought they were working w/ a ""crypto expert"" though.

"Okay so any coin you want to look into getting all you gotta do is go to coinmarketcap.com. Type in name of coin, click the markets tab, click centralized exchanges and it’ll show you a list for that coin. 

Brett can only be purchased through coinbase wallet which you can setup through coinbase app. Turbo can currently be purchased on uphold and or crypto.com and crypto.com defi wallet. Myro can be purchased on all 3 up above. Kaspa is also a very good coin for the long term I believe. Be careful with meme coins! Lots of upside but risky. 

Words of advice, stay away from presales! Only presales you should ever connect a wallet to are from legitimate launchpads. And the wallet I’d connect to those would not contain all my bags. You need to be careful of phishing sites/emails etc. There’s no free lunch and no one’s giving you 500 free etherium so don’t click on those incoming to your wallets. Get a cold storage and don’t keep your coins on the exchanges for the long term. Lastly don’t jump to get the next big crypto from said whatever youtuber or google ad.

1. have the courage to buy during lows, look for opportunities to buy when trading volumes are low, and prices are stable or ranging. This often indicates a good entry point.

"It's still a good time to buy Link.  The hype is b/c their fundamentals are strong.  They have the tech (Oracle/Data Feeds), An amazing team (Top Computer Scientists & former Google Execs) & over 2k Partnerships, including DTCC (stock market), SWIFT (world's largest financial messaging system), JP Morgan, Vodafone,  etc.

If Chainlink pulls off what they're trying to do (which is looking likely) buying Link now would be like being able to invest in https before the internet was mainstream/popular.

Link is also 1 of the safest bets to profit from RWA tokenization.  Since all of the blockchains would need a way to interact.  So the risk is low yet the potential rewars is high!

DTCC alone moves quadrillions of dollars every year.  That would all be flowing through Chainlink after tokenization.  & These major financial companies have tested w/ Link for several years.  They ended testing last year & are now in the transition phase... It would be wise to grab a bag before they flip the switch.

"I have used Binance.US, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com, Uphold. Now the the only two I use regularly are Coinbase and Kraken. Here are some thoughts on each, will put it in the same order as OP for the first ones.

1. Coinbase is the one I use the most now. The fees are reasonable on Coinbase Advanced (so if it seemed to expensive you were probably on simple/basic). Withdraw fees to wallets seem to be the best on most coins/tokens.

2. Crypto.com I dropped because I do not like being charged a spread instead of fees. Spreads are not very transparent on how much of a premium they are charging you on their price quotes. Would revisit if they open a proper exchange in the US.

3. Gemini was great when they offered 10 free withdrawals per month. Definitely was the best place to buy ETH and tokens on Ethereum. After they got rid of that, I didn't really see any reason to keep using Gemini because they have less token selection than the others. Some of my funds also got locked up in their Earn fiasco.

4. Kraken often seems to be highly spoken of on reddit. I haven't ever had to deal with customer service/support on any of the exchanges so can't speak to that. On some altcoins Kraken withdraw fees are much higher than Coinbase which is why I favor Coinbase more. I also didn't like how Kraken didn't stand up to the SEC about their staking service and just settled and shut it down for US.

5. Uphold suffers from similar problems as Crypto.com because they just quote you prices instead of having a proper exchange order book. They also have some annoying fees for small transactions. The only thing I use Uphold for is tokens not available on the other US exchanges.

6. Binance.US was actually the first one I tried but is now practically dead. They dropped support for USD deposits and trading pairs so are a crypto only exchange now. Also seems to be slowly dropping support for states including my own and I have about a month left to get everything off of there. Used to be great but I would stay away now.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuU2dmTURZUnh1TmpVWnZKaGtVZVJ1MFZIOVJHWWhRc2dqU2Nmem0xc2pmZFktQTgyRlRHOFpreFpsUDlEeWZld1Ixd0FKV3JtYTB0V1NpbVh4Y2FDb0E9PQ==

Several crimes were found, infact we got more back from the fines than the mueller report cost.

"Yes I do like the lower trading fees on Kraken pro, and from what I have seen of these exchanges it is the best one to purchase and withdraw BTC on. I don't like to leave much on exchanges so I also watch withdraw fees and not just trading. The reasons I use Coinbase more:

-Kraken does not support my favorite altcoin and Coinbase does.

-On some coins Kraken withdraw fees are much worse than Coinbase. For example, Coinbase charged me .02 TIA to withdraw but Kraken charged me .25 TIA, 12.5x more.

Indeed. People buying now would be the same as buying BTC at 20k end of 2020. If you got out at peak you'd be up 3.5x minus exchange fees and taxes. That's with the huge worldwide COVID stimulus and borrowing rates plummetting in countries across the world. We're at that 2021 peak now ~$70k. 3.5x under today's conditions rather than 2020/2021 seems a bit optimistic even. Better than a year in the S&P500 but not crazy high upside for potentially holding too long. I'd rather risk higher for better upside even though way worse potential downside,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvUHpVUXJaa20wNGhLaGRrTXhRLW83VUgxc1QtSk8xMkRXSEtzMGVqZ1BydWVQekE4QU5OTjFVNzJpTm5PalZBR1cyQWhxYUlVYkQwMFpXZ0tSMjVkckR1cXlEdVNXemFocU91NkU4QjRSdFE9

"Meh, if you want to gamble then go to a casino and put your money on black or red! 

If you want to invest and make money over the course of 5-10 years, invest in BTC as its value will double, triple, etc during that time. Eth is good investment since it’s going to get its own ETF and SOL probably as well.

If you want to invest in shitcoins hoping you’re going to hit the jackpot, more power to you! Theres a reason only about 25% people make money in crypto and that number even dips further for new time investors. The problem is the bullshit youtube videos folks put out like they’re making millions. I always find it hilarious how they all their altcoins always hit 2 weeks after the fact it went in a run and they post a video on it.

If it's not a shitcoin or backed by bad intentions, good luck!

"#DeFi Pro-Arguments
Below is a DeFi pro-argument written by etj103007.

> **What is Decentralized Finance? (DeFi)**
> 
> Decentralized Finance, often shorted to just DeFi, refers to the emerging infrastructure of decentralized financial applications on cryptocurrency.
> 
> Being decentralized, there is no middleman in your transactions. All are dealt with by smart contracts on the blockchain. DeFi allows users to perform existing financial applications on crypto without using centralized exchanges. This gives greater freedom to the users but also makes them fully responsible for their assets.
> 
> All these, and more, will be explained in detail below.
> 
> (NOTE: CeFi in this article will be referring to CeFi on cryptocurrency.)
> 
> # Pros of Decentralized Finance
> 
> **1. Decentralized**
> 
> As per its name, DeFi is decentralized. This allows users to freely trade assets without going thru a third party. This is advantageous to users as it makes it open, easier to use, and generally anonymous too. See the next point for more info.
> 
> **2. Open and easier to use**
> 
> One of the biggest advantages DeFi has is the ease of use and generally lower barrier of entry. Both CeFi and DeFi have similar financial applications. However, most CeFi will require KYC to even use, and those without have usage limits. DeFi, on the other hand, does not have these limitations. DeFi will allow anyone to use its services, as long as they understand it of course.
> 
> This allows anyone to use such platforms for whatever use they want. Loans are quite popular on DeFi. In getting one, there is no need to undergo background checks in DeFi. To the smart contract’s eyes, everyone is equal. As long as you have the collateral, the loan is yours.
> 
> **3. Transparent**
> 
> DeFi is built around smart contracts. It is not surprising that it is transparent, and much more so than CeFi. The blockchain is available to anyone; you can see the code itself in smart contracts. There is no need to worry about your funds as the blockchain is immutable.
> 
> **4. Being actively developed**
> 
> DeFi, being in its infancy, is still being actively developed. Hundreds, if not thousands of programmers, are working on various new platforms, applications, and other technologies each day. This means that there is more opportunity for it to grow in the future.
> 
> **In conclusion:**
> 
> While opponents of DeFi might question its unregulated nature, there is no doubt that educating others about DeFi is much more advantageous than just telling of its risks.
> 
> TLDR: DeFi, as per its name, is decentralized, open, easier to use, transparent, and actively developed.

"#DeFi Con-Arguments
Below is a DeFi con-argument written by etj103007.

> 
> Despite all these characteristics of DeFi, it has many major problems that make it unreliable and risky to invest in.
> 
> # Cons of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
> 
> **1. Liquidity**
> 
> Firstly, it suffers from liquidity problems. As most DeFi applications are new and/or still ramping up, they have to make people add liquidity to their pools. However, liquidity providers can be incentivized to move their liquidity to other platforms (thru the vampire attack, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFjXwrCGuog&ab_channel=Finematics).
> 
> Now, not every asset pair will have its own pool. So in swapping tokens, assets may take multi-hops, being swapped for different assets until you get the one you want. In the end, the user gets less or even much less worth of said asset than what they started with. While technically not a fault of liquidity, it definitely is one side issue caused by it.
> 
> This also means DeFi will be volatile in the foreseeable future.
> 
> **2. Difficulties in introduction**
> 
> DeFi, while being generally easy to use and even having a lower barrier of entry, still doesn’t guarantee it will be used worldwide. While many would ignore this and simply say that DeFi is still in its infancy, it doesn’t excuse the fact that this would be the biggest problem for DeFi in the years to come.
> 
> For example, in CeFi, you can freely trade coins on exchanges, and withdraw them with minimal fees. But in DeFi, you are usually limited to one coin and its layer 2’s. Even though bridges exist (both cross-chain and between L2’s), it still affects the user’s ability to transact.
> 
> **3. Unregulated**
> 
> Unlike in CeFi and CEXes which is (for the most part) regulated and abides by government regulations, DeFi will stay unregulated. Regulations will bring about safer markets and less risk for the average person.
> 
> In DeFi, while being anonymous might be advantageous, it might go wrong in certain situations. For example, if some DeFi protocol collapses, there might be no focal person to pin incidents on. Sure, you may blame the developers or others, but what if they are anonymous?
> 
> Regulation has mixed reception within the crypto community. Most, however, think that some regulation is good for crypto. Of course, a regulated DeFi is oxymoronic; you cannot centralize the power in a decentralized sector.
> 
> **4. Risky**
> 
> With DeFi is often called the “Wild West” of crypto; and with all the incidents of DeFi hacks, exploits and vulnerabilities, it doesn’t help at all that it is unregulated. Every week, there seems to be a new protocol hacked, smart contracts drained, and coins rug-pulled.
> 
> But, even if you somehow have the most secure blockchain, the most secure smart contracts, and the most secured DApps, DeFi is still inherently risky.
> 
> Of course, it should be noted that crypto, in general, is risky, but DeFi increases this risk due to:
> 
> * Slippage – Inevitable, but with little liquidity, it becomes a fact of life.
> * impermanent loss in liquidity pools –[see this binance article](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)
> * Front-Running – bots that aim to make profit by looking at transactions.
> * Rug pulls – While not limited to DeFi, most rugpulls do occur on DeFi platforms.
> 
> **In conclusion:**
> 
> While users of DeFi may say that it is still new and being developed, it isn’t a reason to ignore these problems. DeFi developers would need to solve these issues for it to prosper.
> 
> TLDR: DeFi suffers liquidity problems, difficulties in introduction, is unregulated and inherently riskier than CeFi.

"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by a deleted user which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> **First-Mover Advantage and The Network Effect**
> 
> Bitcoin is currently the most popular cryptocurrency and market cap leader by a long shot. The [Bitcoin dominance chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts) shows that Bitcoin represents 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This has increased from 40% in 2020.
> 
> Bitcoin is the **gateway**. People start out with Bitcoin before checking out other cryptocurrencies. They're likely going to keep holding any Bitcoin they bought along the way.
> 
> People will flock to whichever product has the largest user base. For half a decade, Bitcoin was almost synonymous with cryptocurrency. The Network Effect creates a **positive feedback loop** and makes Bitcoin's lead grow even more.
> 
> If Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin were all released simultaneously, Bitcoin would lose to its PoW competitors because its competitors have cheaper fees with higher throughput. But the reality is that Bitcoin's first-mover advantage gave it such a huge head start that the others can't catch up.
> 
> **Has the largest block reward for security**
> 
> Due to its high price, Bitcoin has a huge [block reward of 6.5 BTC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving) (halves every 4 years) or ~$180k per block. This gives it the security lead because its block reward is so much bigger than other PoW cryptocurrencies, which attracts more miners.
> 
> **Anti-censorship**
> 
> Bitcoin provides partial censorship-resistance against sanctions and totalitarian government restrictions. It's much harder to prevent Bitcoin transactions than it is to prevent financial transactions at a centralized bank. [Legal sex workers](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks) (e.g. Onlyfans) and [marijuana industries](https://www.leadingretirement.com/blog/cannabis-banking) are blocked from using traditional financial services due to social stigma. Even though they can operate legally, many TradFi banks avoid operating with them. Bitcoin provides those workers a way to transfer funds around that censorship.
> 
> **Avoids Hyperinflation**: As long as governments keep causing high inflation through money-printing, people will run to Bitcoin for safety, which pumps up Bitcoin's price.
> 
> **Considered a commodity by both SEC and CFTC**: Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that both the SEC and CFTC have openly agreed is a commodity. And the CFTC is much less lawsuit-happy than the SEC.
> 
> **Legal tender**: El Salvador has shown (despite some technical mishaps) that Bitcoin can be successfully used as legal tender for a country.
> 
> **Ordinals provide utility**
> 
> Even though Bitcoin Maxis hate Ordinals, this new protocol gives utility to Bitcoin and adds demand. NFT bros are using it as an **on-chain data storage layer** for their own blockchains (e.g. Ethereum, Stack). This has an advantage over IPFS since IPFS is stored in centralized databases instead of on-chain.
> 
> This generates more fees for Bitcoin miners. Transaction fees have finally [risen to ~20 sats/vByte](https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool) on days with high Ordinals activity like Mar 22-24. This gives hope that there may be sufficient demand for Bitcoin as an on-chain data-storage layer even after the block subsidy eventually disappears due to halvings.
> 
> **Pseudonymous**: Bitcoin's UTXO transactions can provide moderately-high levels of obscurity. A single wallet can produce a near-unlimited amount of addresses, and there's no way to link them unless they interact with each other. It's much harder to trace UTXO-based wallets than Account-based wallets because the former creates new UTXO addresses with each transaction while Account-based blockchain wallets typically reuse the same account.
> 
> **Lightning transactions are near-instant and cheap**
> 
> As long as you're spending small amounts of Bitcoin, you can use the Lightning network to make near-instant, sub-$0.01 transactions. Many Lightning nodes for merchants are connected to 3rd-party services that convert between cash and Lightning, making it easy to transfer Bitcoins. Consumers usually don't have to care about rebalancing issues since they're only spending small amounts.
> 
> And the [total capacity of the Lightning Network](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity) in BTC keeps increasing steadily.
> 
> **Cannot be counterfeited**: Cash can be counterfeited, but you can't fake Lightning transactions. Merchants have to deal with counterfeit cash in many markets around the world.
> 
> **Bitcoin has a very strong community of die-hard supporters**
> 
> A huge portion of Bitcoin supporters have become Bitcoin Maxis who will keep spreading their arguments, regardless of accuracy. Because Bitcoin is a gateway cryptocurrency, crypto newbies will encounter it first and gobble up these narratives because they don't have the experience to know their flaws. And they're very convincing when you keep repeating them in an echo chamber:
> 
> * Maximum supply cap of 21M BTC vs Fed's money printer
> * Amazing past-performance gains vs fiat
> * Works as Store of Value (despite volatility)
> * Had a ""fair launch"" without an ICO
> * Is not a risky altcoin
> * Is decentralized (based on largest number of miners)
> * Has instant payments via the Lightning Network
> 
> **Ultimately, people are mainly using crypto for speculative investing and long-term Store of Value. Most people don't care about technology, Defi, or utility. Thus Bitcoin is sufficient for their investment needs.**
> 
> And since cryptocurrency value is largely based on a Keynesian Beauty Contest (i.e. you buy not based on your own value, but on what you think others are going to buy), people are going to keep buying Bitcoin as long as the investment narrative holds.

"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 3rd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> # Bitcoin, could it be wrong. ""Are we the bad guys ?"" 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> In this small write up, I am going to delve into con-arguments against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the flagship of cryptocurrencies but there are a lot of criticism that could be leveraged against Bitcoin. First of all, let's delve into a small presentation of Bitcoin. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: An introduction. 
> 
> Bitcoin is the biggst cryptocurrency. It was created by a mysterious figure. The creation of Bitcoin is a strange and mysterious  mystery. No one knows who created Bitcoin.  
>   
> Bitcoin was started as a way to circumvent traditional banking. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology. Blockchain can be seen as an open book allowing anyone to know where is each fraction of Bitcoin ever.  
>   
> This blockchain is maintained through computer power. In a vulgar way: Bitcoin is mined by solving math problems. The maths problem becomes harder when more people are mining so that mining takes a fixed amount of time according to a timeline known to everyone. In order to respect this timeline, mining rewards are halved every few years.  
>   
> Since anyone who wants to validate transactions is forced to complete a very hard math problem (which becomes harder the more people are mining), no one can cheat in new transactions. Also, every other miner has a copy of the blockchain. Through making sure that no entity has 50% of the mining, you can stop nefarious actors from changing the blockchain.  
>   
> This is using cryptographic technology that I don't yet understand but you can read more about it here:  
>   
> Bitcoin Wikipedia  
>   
> Without delving more into the tech side of bitcoin. Which can also be explained through youtube videos here: Bitcoin explained  
>   
> The Metrics of Bitcoin are currently: 22400$ Per coin for a Market cap of 430 Bilions and a daily volume of 19 Billions. Bitcoin was shortly valued at 69000 usd during the ATH.  
>   
> Now let's dive into what is making Bitcoin so bad.
> 
> # Permissionless: A senseless destruction of world order. 
> 
> Bitcoin is a project existing in a very delicate world balanced by power structure. While we can be happy that the current top dog is the US (yes they are not perfect BUT they could be worse) we know that someone else could be on top. Despite that, we should strive to use the current US dominance to curb rogue states into the world order. 
> 
> The current war in Ukraine is a demonstration of the world order crumbling to maintain itself. I'd argue, the rise of cryptocurrencies may be a part of this crumbling. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that, Bitcoin replacing the US Dollar would usher a chaotic age of international relation. 
> 
> The world has shrank a lot since the rise of internet. The fact is that the stability of the world is much more precious than ever. Everyone can see what happens in any other country and how the supply chains which guarantee our comfort are of the utmost importance. YET, we are pushing forward a great disrupter of balance. 
> 
> Permissionless can help terrorists, permissionless can help crime. YES traditionnal banking is doing it already BUT I'd argue that the absence of regulator and watchdog to make the current system comply is not an argument in favor of a tech which will make regulation and surveillance harder. 
> 
> # Bitcoin: This MONEY Doesn't Work, This Money Doesn't WORK. 
> 
> Bitcoin is claiming to be a currency. A viable alternative to fiat money. But anyone with a neuron or two could realize that the fluctuation in the value of Bitcoin is crazy. Some pedentic nerd and bitcoin maximalist could argue that 1 BTC = 1 BTC BUT if you don't know how much you'll need to put food on the table then BTC is not working as a currency. Yes inflation is lowering the value of Fiat BUT fiat doesn't see wild swings of + or -  30 % in most economies. 
> 
> While not being really MONEY I'd argue that Bitcoin doesn't WORK. To work the economy needs money to move. 100$ could buy groceries then be used to pay the local brewery, the butcher and many more people before going back to a bank account. This movement has created economic vitality. Bitcoin, most of the time, is seen as an investment vehicle such as gold. I'd argue that these vehicle are not valuable for society since the freeze money in place. 
> 
> In a bank, your money is working. Instead of Bitcoin, people should be paid more by banks to put their money in investment portfolios since these provide the liquidity necessary to make the economy work. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Bitcoin: A very big spending of energy. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> Bitcoin is a project which is wasting a lot of ressource for something which is not making a lot of sense. While Bitcoin is using more and more green energy, I'd argue that it is still a big waste. Subsidies could prop up the green sector far better than the mining farms that go with windfarms. 
> 
> Seeing Bitcoin as one of the biggest leverage of the green sector is a non-sense. Optimization of the energy sector means that the variable production should allow to reduce the use of fossil energy. Not allow to waste energy in a senseless project. 
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Conclusion: The harsh truth is, we may be the bad guys. 
> 
> Partaking in an economic sector which allows for a disruption of world order, which doesn't help the economy and which is wasting energy may not be beneficial. This is why Bitcoin should not be seen as a messiah of economic proportion but as something which should raise criticism and should be heavily regulated. 
> 
> Good luck in your investments.

"I’m someone who took the whole round trip. 

I learned so much by holding my bags through the last cycle, the last bull and bear market, which at one point had my portfolio down 76% in total value. 

I was new to crypto in 2020 and honestly I was on the verge of having invested more than I could afford to lose. So I knew that if I sold at a loss I would lose big and that my life would be directly impacted by the decision to sell. 

Instead I held my investments and I researched the coins I owned. I watched the charts go up and down for years and I felt the most severe emotions, but I learned as I held on.

Holding about 15 coins through a bear market is the single biggest lesson I have ever had. It taught me the importance of planning an exit strategy ahead of time, which coins I want to keep moving forward and which ones to sell.

Having felt extremely low for almost a year… having actually been there… that was a freaking humbling lesson and now I know what to do when Bitcoin hits that 500k, 1M, 10M figure.

This market will not go up forever without pullbacks, nor will it go to zero without pumps. 

It is not the end of the world if you miss the top this cycle. It might actually be the lesson you’re missing.

"I hold a few ETH from the early days.  To be honest I don't buy anymore.  Happy to hold and eventually sell.

Price will go up, price will go down.  

At some point we'll all want to start selling these tokens and only then will we find out what they are really worth.  The price isn't really being tested while most of us hold.

Right now we all spend a few spare hundred each month.

Then eventually we retire.  Then we all start selling a few thousand a month to live on.

That will be a big shift in price pressure.

Only then will we find out whether that was the future or not.

The coin which has a new wave of buyers ready to take our tokens is the one that succeeds.  And we'll need a lot of buyers to support the price we'll all need to sell at.

I won't be getting excited just yet.

But I'm hopeful.

I actually do think ETH has a better chance of sustaining a decent price when the shift happens.  I feel like bitcoin will go much higher but will crash much harder because so many will start selling when they come to retire.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvOWU4R1hVZEZLN0NrU2lyV2tveExCMzVja01hb084SkZPOGFCRWZxOVMwVUJuM0ZOMFRTSURNdzN3WDR1R1VCTnYtM2NrMWNRT1FqQml3UXl1R2NOLUE9PQ==

"ETFs are required to pay dividends based on income - [https://www.proshares.com/faqs/dividends-in-proshares-crypto-linked-funds-and-OILK](https://www.proshares.com/faqs/dividends-in-proshares-crypto-linked-funds-and-OILK)

See the dividend schedule here - https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/strategic/bito.

If you held BITO on 6/3, you are entitled to a dividend of 1.767963 per share, but you can sell on or after 6/3 and still get the dividend. Thus, one BITO held on 6/2 was worth roughly 1.767963 per share more (putting Bitcoin price fluctuations aside) than one held on 6/3 because anyone buying on or after 6/3 would not get the dividend.

"Op and Arb are similar to base in fees. A bit cheaper even lately.  Under $0.01 for a swap. 

Base and arb are essentially op forks, more accurately they are their own implementations of the Optimism stack. 

 Both arbitrum and OP have a lot of the DeFi ecosystem that you know on base. Aerodrome is a fork of Velodrome on OP for example (it’s the same dev team for both) 

Uniswap, curve, balancer, 1inch, ODOS, and a lot of the usual suspects are on all 3 of these chains so you’re likely to be familiar with it when you dive in. 

All these chain use ETH as the gas token too so you just need to bridge some ETH into them to play around.  Using something like squidrouter would let you swap cross chain from Base to OP or ARB for a few cents in fees too

"Personally I look for coins that are strong against Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the staple of crypto, it's the one that poses the least risk. If your altcoin is not outperforming Bitcoin, then you're essentially assuming the extra risk for no reason.

I chart everything in BTC. So rather than only looking at SOLUSD chart, I look at SOLBTC. So what exactly are we looking for then?

Bitcoins big breakout of the 31k-25k range, was a big signal for me that Crypto is now a risk-on environment. Bear market over. This breakout occurred in October 2023.

I would recommend, looking at some of these charts.

RNDR/BTC
NEAR/BTC
SOL/BTC
JASMY/BTC
AR/BTC
PEPE/BTC

What you will notice is that these charts are all uptending against their BTC value since October 2023. This is a sign to me that they are stronger than Bitcoin. The next surge in crypto should really see altcoins gain value.

If you look at coins like MATIC, ADA, and chart them against BTC, you will see that they are only going lower, against Bitcoin value. This says to me, I would rather just hold BTC.

It never feels right buying a token that has already pumped, but at the end of the day, they are uptending for a reason.

So people who think merger is not beneficial, have already sold by now. They won't wait to sell untilll now of post merger. On the other hand, people who believe in merger are holding, even long time after merger. So there's no reason to believe there is a big group of people going to sell at merger. In fact, big majority will hold or buy more.

"RWA’s will be a big deal. Especially when new money comes in, they will want more secure investments. I don’t anticipate them all being degens like the rest of us. Unicoin has already sold $2.3 billion worth of real estate thus far. I started following it when they got into real estate. They will be ICOing when they hit $3 billion. That’s pretty impressive. These dudes have a network show called unicorn hunters as well, where they get equity from all the companies that are featured on it. Panel of judges is the great Steve Wozniak, Chris Diamantopoulos, Lance Bass, Rosie Rios, Moe Vela and others. It’s like Shark tank but better because the viewers get to invest rather than a few already rich sharks.

"Welcome to the crypto world! It's a wild ride, but there's definitely potential to find some gems. While past gains don't guarantee future success, there are some memecoins with interesting projects and passionate communities. Speaking of navigating the memeverse, 8livesio has a great video on spotting memecoins with long-term potential (it's not all about the next Doge!).

Here's a thing to consider when looking at memecoins:

* **Community:** A strong, engaged community can be a good sign. Look for projects with active social media channels and a positive vibe.
* **Utility:** While not essential, some memecoins are building actual use cases for their tokens. This can help them stand out in the long run.
* **The Hype Factor:** Be wary of memecoins that are all hype and no substance. Do your research and understand the project before investing.

Remember, memecoins are still a risky investment. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and don't chase the latest pump. There will always be new opportunities!

Here are some additional tips for your research:

* **Check out CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko:** These sites list a bunch of memecoins, along with basic info like price and market cap.
* **Read project whitepapers:** This will give you a better idea of what the memecoin is trying to achieve.
* **Join memecoin communities:** Telegram and Discord groups are a good way to learn more about different projects, but be cautious of shilling and scams!

Good luck on your memecoin journey! Always DYOR (do your own research) before investing.

To resolve the No quotes available error on MetaMask you need to increase your maximum slippage step by step . You can start by setting your maximum slippage to 3% and gradually increase it to 4% and 5% . By increasing the maximum slippage you improve the chances of a successful swap .

"To answer your question no one knows whether any coin will be good or bad. 
A typical journey goes like this: the asset starts going up and you think yes maybe I should have bought more. then it starts going down and you think ""no no no don't!"" You might sell you or you might feel panicky but hold on a bit longer and then finally sell when it reaches a value of $0.00000001. That of course is when it starts picking up and you see that it's now a good investment. But you wait to be absolutely sure. After it really shows some promise you buy back in but by then it's already too late, the bull run is over and you watch your investment dwindle again. But this time you revenge buy. You're going to teach it a lesson by buying more and more. Unfortunately the last bull run turned out to be a pump and dump and the coin lingers near 0.00000000001 for a couple of years.

Bitcoin is a stable coin. It's no longer as volatile as it was earlier days. The ETFs inflows are breaking record.  We just had the Bitcoin Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL)  when it dibbed at $56k making the Long term holders to sell , increasing the supply and demand at $56k.

If you ask me - We are still in a dib and just 20% off the dip and maybe 120% off the Top.

"I’ve had numerous coins I’ve sold/swapped after making 4XPlus, however they’ve all been relatively small $Value amounts I actually used to buy them.   None of them have come out of crypto to my bank, they all gone into my much bigger $Value coins that I’m holding on to.  

My strategy has always been based on a three tier strategy with largest $Value and lowest risk in Tier one.  Certain coins move between the tiers as they evolve, show promise or they have a price jump.   I predominantly buy coins that are more than 90% down from last ATH.  But there are caveats, a couple of new coins, I discount the ATH altogether, the ATH is a poor metric to me on its own, but you can use it with other fundamentals.  

I sold all my GEKKO/FER/DeRace/LIDO/CAW and a few others for high multipliers that went to other coins.  They were good buys at the average price I bought.  

I’m holding a few others with high multipliers, such as:

FET/CKB/GALA/AVAX/SOL.    These all have much more $Value invested than those I sold/swapped, and I’m holding because I think there’s a lot more to come.  

I’ve other high $Value coins that are up from the average cost basis, but again not enough to sell (between 50% & 1.5X) and I believe there’s a lot more to come:

CRO/EGLD/DOT/KSM/SHIB

I’ve some other small holdings that are by legacy coins from when I first started in crypto, they have done nothing and some are down.  But, not by much and all of them are relatively small $Value each.  

VET/ALGO/ADA/ENJIN/CHZ/GLM/ONE

A high percentage of all my coins are in staking and earning, at today’s market I’m getting around $1250/month from staking.  

I have CDC’s crypto card, and got one for hubby and it’s working out very well in my opinion.   

I do have target $Values per coin/token, however these do change occasionally and I’ll be selling to send to my bank as $ to spend.   Hopefully all this selling will be during the peak, if it’s not where I want it I’ll hold, I don’t need to sell anything fortunately.   

In case you’re wondering, that’s right, no BTC ETH, part of a deliberate strategy.   Is my strategy perfect, no it’s not, I know I could have done better in certain circumstances.  

As a final analysis, whole portfolio is up approximately 120% from what I’ve “invested”.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3dE1yLURxbnZ6S2RFQ054eU1QeTd6dXdMSXhEb1BUbVhLV19CM2JMeWdka1Q5T2tCaVdja2g5bWszdDRXaUZBZlQ0cmFhZTkyN2JXcUdNUnhDa1JZWlE9PQ==

"It’s already recovered a lot of that dip. The markets are still up compared to a week ago. Crypto is volatile AF. Strap in and DCA when you can. I was lucky enough to have some extra cash to lower my average costs on some of my recent purchased coins.  I was in during the last wild bull run in 2021 and panic sold during the crash. If I would have just held until now, I would have been looking at 90% loses for a year but then I would also have been up an unbelievable amount by now as everything has recovered for me.

Lessons learned - 
1) I’ll continue to dollar-cost-average into mainstays like ETH, DOT, SOL, ADA, etc;
2) staying away from meme crap
3) let crypto run its course. If it crashes to historic lows, I’m not selling this time.

"We can't speculate what price will do because it is Sat/Sun or Weekday. BTC price is compressed for last 3 months, Mar-Apr-May. It is likely to accelerate. If it can't stay above 67500, it has good enough 15% down move. If it crosses 73000, it has good enough 15% upward move. Between 67500 - 73000 there is no need to take any action. If an investor has invested $700 when BTC was 70k, he need not worry of loss of 25, if loss increase than 25 on investment of 700, he need sell and book loss of 25.

"You don’t have to register wallets. Depending what coin your are buying you can use a basic software wallet like metamask or trust, but these are hot wallets, connected to the internet. 
This is fine for small amounts for day to day use.
For larger amounts you need to use a wallet that’s never seen the internet. So you need an offline machine that’s not going to ever be connected to the internet. Create your wallet address, then save the private key and public key (and seed phrase if that’s how the wallet was generated)
If you are just holding coins then that’s litterally all you need, those keys saved safely written down is enough. There is no need for any software or hardware. 
Never keep any keys online and never keep large amounts in hot wallets.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eFlWMUVzNVVpWklQWVRVQ1J6SF9yYzhBZU9NSXVZeTJYa3RBcDJPYmxZOTlNUktjcm5DQkRYZ09HLVRsUXRyb1BnWk04V0YzQmJrUG5admtQcUpMTGc9PQ==

"Hedge funds use a clever strategy called the ""carry trade"" to manage their Bitcoin investments. This involves holding actual Bitcoin (spot Bitcoin) and at the same time betting against Bitcoin in the futures market.
Hedge funds buy a lot of Bitcoin and keep it. For example, Millenium Fund bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin. This is a big part of the flows over the last 19 days.
At the same time, they bet that the price of Bitcoin will go down by selling Bitcoin futures contracts. If the price of Bitcoin does go down, they can buy these contracts back at a lower price and make a profit. 

If the price stays flat, they profit from the premium. 

Bitcoin futures often trade at higher prices than the actual Bitcoin. By shorting these futures, hedge funds can earn the difference, which can give them returns of 14% to 30% per year.

This has been done in the GOLD market for decades",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4d2l4NVFEQWJvN2xRZFFHeTNFa2lKYm12MHRhdVZ2b09Ha2RRN2tGRlJ3eGd5U1pKUEI4eV9IeS0yd3hCVWlhZkI2UDlfT01IUWFzQlFGcXRaSjd6Qmc9PQ==

"This seems like a chatgpt response.  I understand the carry trade.

"When hedge funds short Bitcoin futures, it creates selling pressure. This can influence the actual price of Bitcoin and prevent it from rising too much, even if there is a lot of buying interest. This selling pressure can spill over into the spot market, especially if the futures market influences traders' perceptions of Bitcoin's value. As a result, even tho there is significant buying interest in Bitcoin ETFs, the overall price increase of Bitcoin stays flat.

"GMX is the biggest thing on Arb by far. 

Honestly I think the GMX token under like $80 is a solid buy and I have been stacking more and more.  

The max supply is below 14 million coins.  


I also have been buying into ARX if you’re looking for a risky but crazy low cap token.  ARX is the token for Arbidex which is a pretty decent uniswap fork built by a doxed dev team who have a decent track record of delivering solid projects.  

The team is the same as the BaseSwap team on Base chain. 

Either way ARX is deep in the toilet and the token has a max supply of like 20,000,000.  I believe in the teams vision and so play a little gamble positing in ARX still.  I have just been farming ARX/ETH lp on the dex and compounding the yield into it for over a year now and I have over 7% of the total liquidity at this point so you know, I’m biased a bit lol.

"It’s through arbitrage traders.

Futures contracts have a settlement date when people who have short or long futures positions have to pay the difference between the spot and the futures price.

The way it works is something like this:

Let’s say futures traders start shorting the BTC futures like there is no tomorrow. Imagine this hypothetical scenario. There is an endless supply of short sellers, who keep pushing the futures prices down, no matter what. If this happens, the futures price will deviate from the spot price so much, that some spot holders start to think like “Wait a minute, I’m holding spot, and price is at 70k. Futures prices are at 60k. I believe price will be 80k 3 months from now, when the futures contract settles. I’ll just sell my BTC, and buy futures. I’ll make more gains.” And thus, they sell BTC spot. Which, in turn causes the spot price to fall, if many people do this. Which there will be many people doing this if there is an endless supply of short sellers on the futures market and prices are pushed down (which is our hypothetical scenario). This is how futures can push the spot price down.

Now, there will always be some discrepancy between the futures and spot price, because arbitrage trades have risks and costs too. This discrepancy can be larger or smaller, depending on market conditions, but there are always forces at play (arbitrage traders) that pull the spot and futures price closer to each other.

And it works the other way too. If futures prices deviate too much upwards from spot, that pulls up the spot price. Because arbitrage traders will say “ok, this difference is too big. I’ll just buy spot, and short the futures market”. So, they buy spot. Spot price goes up. (*They win either way. Either gain on the spot, or on their short position when the futures contract expires.)* But the point is that these kind of trades affect the price!

Futures affects spot, and spot affects futures. If there are strong forces on either side that causes the price to deviate, the other will follow sooner or later.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aGFJWndsbXRhUlFxZTdXUG03Z2x4b19BWmdUUU1TY0FTbjVsbmZRQmRZVFhKRE1EQzdDVHJORmVpUkhNcnlEQjV6S25SLUp3Rm9IMzlnNjB1U0RGbEE9PQ==
"Hbar is definitely a sleeper, typically shunned by crypto communities, due to its utility and corporate backing. This means the price is low due to low retail acceptance.

Hedera does not need retail adoption to take off, with transactions creating buying pressure for the tokens, which will push the price higher on its own. Xrp has a lot of fourms breaking down a velocity modeling. For some dyor on how this works. 

Once the general public starts to worry more about making money, then they worry about some cyber punk dilution of a sovereign nation currency. Hbar will explode with retail as well. Before then, I expect its transaction volume will carry it a top 10 MC alone.

"15y+ programmer, 7years trader here, programmed myself 2 trading bots/systems in php and python.
I know your struggle and in my experience I can tell up this: programmatically determining trends  is super hard because of the contradicting natures: classic programming is a fixed-rules based architecture. Trends simply are an interpretation of data. There are simply too many exceptions to fixed rules a trend can show.
So yes, an uptrend can have 3 bearish patterns. Or more. Or less. Who knows? The answer is: it depends on the specific situation and chart.

I got my best result by identifying higher highs and higher lows. It works quite well but still I had to work in many exceptions to the rule and i‘m aware that there’s no 100% detection.

A completely different approach is using AI. This is not a fixed-rule approach anymore but somewhat in the human direction of interpreting data. And in my opinion the only way (it will still be complex and hard)

"In my 2nd attempt (python) I completely got rid of indicators because I follow a strict price action approach. I identified highs and lows with pivot functions, put them in chronological order in a list and checked if they’re higher highs and higher lows (or for a downtrend reversed). One exception could occur: it is allowed to have one lower high OR lower low if the following pivot is higher again. If one high is lower than the previous one and low is lower than the previous one, the uptrend is broken.
Then I checked the length of the trend (= number of correctly ordered pivots). If > 4 it is a valid uptrend (4 is a completely random number).
Another exception was, when the pivot analysis detected two consecutive highs (or lows) instead of alternating. Then I decreased the pivot window size and checked for highs and lows again between the two consecutive pivots.

"I have a friend that calls himself a crypto investor... He doesn't own *any* crypto directly. His portfolio is full of bitcoin miners. 

He works like this because he CBA to sort out a crypto wallet and doesn't like the risk of things going wrong. I guess for him he feels secure in the familiarity of stocks. I'm not sure that's the best approach and I think the technical barrier is easily resolved.

In the UK you can get a stock and share ISA (you pay no tax on the capital gains). This *might* represent an opportunity to generate more profit. In the UK at least, most of the time it doesn't make sense to invest outside of your ISA allowance. Saying that, I've not checked the %gain in crypto Vs bitcoin miners (or if they are available within the ISA wrapper). This might be the real stinger... I imagine crypto gains are higher.

You also have the risk of being a company. Stocks and shares can be linked to the demise of a company. It needs to complete filings, continue to operate and someone can fuck up. I don't think this operational risk is really true for crypto. 

Finally it depends on your personal beliefs around crypto. If you believe it's just hyped nonsense that will rip, maybe you don't need the crypto directly. If you believe that it will be a mainstream currency, then perhaps owning directly is the answer. 

Anyway. Just some things to consider!",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5NDl4cjZHSnpuYXI3VXRqeDNCQmw2NExpSjVjWlNkZU4yM25rWTZOTGNHSk16S3FaOEkzcFNvMGdTVG1Eb2U1dTZYWW5rWkU5a1hITk1vbVhxbmpZbXc9PQ==

You either convert it in something less dangerous like BTC,ETH,SOL,BNB and wait until next year at the hype of the bull run and DCA out.Or keep the LINK,stake it and wait for the best price next year.

If you can’t hold,then it’s best to convert in something and try to recover whatever you can from that 14%.

"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by excalilbug which won 1st place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Ethereum has been one of the top coins for more than 6 years now. And there are several reasons why it’s so popular:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * **Reliability**
> 
> Launched in 2016, Ethereum has been very reliable. Some networks (e.g. Solana) had more issues in single week than Ethereum in all its history. The only issues I can remember is of course the [famous hack](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/17/the-55m-hack-that-almost-brought-ethereum-down/) (it was in the beginning of ETH) that led to the creation of ETH Classic and the network congestion in 2017 caused by… [internet cats](https://consensys.net/blog/news/the-inside-story-of-the-cryptokitties-congestion-crisis/). What else could it be, right?
> 
> Other than that ETH remained very stable and trustworthy. It had no downtimes and new partners were joining the network which led to the next pro of Ethereum:
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * **Adoption**
> 
> One of the biggest advantages of Ethereum is its widespread adoption. It had the first mover advantage and it used it pretty well. Today the [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/eea-members/) includes dozens of members, among them such big names as JP Morgan, Ernst & Young or Microsoft
> 
> Every regular visitor to r/cryptocurrency is also probably aware that Reddit chose Ethereum for their community points program. Currently Moons run on one of Ethereum layer 2 protocols called Arbitrum Nova
> 
> Also worth mentioning is the fact that the [total value locked on Ethereum network is almost 60% of all chains](https://defillama.com/chains) and almost 6 times more than its biggest competitors, Tron and Binance chains (both “just” 10%)
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * **Advantages of PoW -> PoS transition**
> 
> Transition from PoW to PoS of course has some disadvantages (the rich get richer) but it’s hard to deny that there are also some advantages. And probably the biggest one is the energy usage decrease. The [energy used by Ethereum is now almost 100% lower](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more) than when it was a PoW coin
> 
> The other advantage of recent updates is the fact that ETH is now deflationary. After the implementation of EIP-1559 ETH now burns a fraction of the gas fees per transaction (so there are some positive sides to high fees too – more ETH is burned :P). [This year, in less than 3 months, more than 66,000 ETH was burned](https://finbold.com/ethereum-supply-drops-by-66000-eth-in-2023-making-it-deflationary/)
> 
> And it’s not the end. Soon, on 12 April 2023, ETH will have another upgrade called Shanghai-Capella (Shapella). One of its improvements is [EVM Object Format](https://sensoriumxr.com/articles/375). It will separate code from data. It should make the network easier to use and it will reduce gas fees
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> * **Layer 2 solutions**
> 
> One of the biggest problems of Ethereum are high gas fees. But thanks to a very active community and smart develoeprs this problem is circumvented. Layer 2 protocols have very low fees while utilizing the benefits of Ethereum blockchain. They decrease data traffic by redirecting it offchain
> 
> Those layer 2 solutions are so popular that Arbitrum has 4th largest total value locked in it and Polygon and optimism are 5th and 6th respectively! ([https://defillama.com/chains](https://defillama.com/chains))

"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chysce which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> **>> Scalability**
> 
> Ethereum's greatest challenge is [scalability](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/ethereum-scaling/introduction-to-ethereum-scaling/). This issue manifests in two ways - long transaction times and high fees. The large number of transactions on ethereum network can cause congestion resulting in delays and very high gas fees. Ethereum Merge event did not resolve this issue, it only paved the way for future optimizations of gas fees.
> 
> **>> Ethereum is not so decentralized**
> 
> Despite its decentralized nature, Ethereum has become increasingly centralized over time, with a small number of entities controlling a large portion of the network's resources and governance. For regular Ethereum user it is hard to run a node so they have to rely on [external node infrastructure providers](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/blockchain-node-providers) who can censor whatever they want.
> 
> **>> Vulnerable to attacks**
> 
> Transition to proof of stake made Ethereum more [vulnerable to attacks](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-merge-makes-network-more-vulnerable-to-attack-security-expert). *""Unlike proof-of work systems, a proof-of-stake (PoS) system informs node validators in advance what blocks they will validate, thus enabling them to plan attacks.""*
> 
> **>>  Solidity barrier**
> 
> Another issue with Ethereum is its programming language. Developers who are proficient in C, Python or Java cannot easily transition to Ethereum and create dApps. They must instead learn a completely different coding language (Solidity). This slows down the process of onboarding new developers and creating dApps.
> 
> **>> Ethereum could be labeled a security**
> 
> There are early [hints](https://www.theblock.co/post/220297/gensler-suggests-proof-of-stake-tokens-are-securities) that ETH might be labeled a security. If that happens any US citizen would have to hire a licensed broker to buy and sell ETH for them. This would significantly hinder its growth potential.

"You *were* fucked by your own stupidity. Now, going forward, know that there are scams, hackers, and malware, that want nothing more than for you to send them untraceable money.

Now, you know that these exist. You know how they got you. You've learned a lesson. Hopefully you've taken away some lessons from the event and from this thread on how to better protect yourself (don't click links that you're not sure where they go or what they do, get a hardware wallet, stay up to date on scams, hacks, and other nefarious things in the Cardano-sphere specifically, crypto more generically, and ""internet security"" as a whole, etc).

I don't know who got your ADA, or exactly how it happened technically. And I know how it's gonna sound, and I don't mean to take a dig at you specifically, but...people like you need to exist (and tell their story) so that others can both understand the risk, and technical folks can stay one step ahead of the scammers and hackers.

Thank you for your sacrifice, and thank you for posting about it. Any other information you have about it might be helpful. Any logs, usernames, emails, timestamps, etc. Post your wallet address if you know it and it might be easy to see where your ADA went. Probably doesn't help in getting it back, but it lets people see which wallets on-chain are up to no good. They can be blacklisted, or exchanges can look into them, or (if it were a larger theft in a country that cares about crypto), authorities could look into it.

Don't let this turn you off from crypto as a whole. It's not *crypto's* fault that you got robbed. Just like it wouldn't be the government's fault if someone broke into your house and stole your housekeys or your cash. It's just something that happened because, at some level, you were not as prepared to be stolen from as the thieves were to steal from you.

"Friend, if you didn't cash out you didn't lose. Here's some knowledge.

Link is an og project, been around for a while. Swapping right now will validate your loss, and you'll eat it up in fees on top of that. 

Everything is down, so even if you swap to another project, you swapped to another down coin or BTC/eth for that matter. BTC weighs alts down when it dips.

Your best bet is to stay calm and chive on. DCA new cash to BTC or ETH at the moment. Link will recover and keep going. 


14% dip is nothing in crypto. Especially chain link. Figure out what your stress or loss level is: 10, 15, 25, 33 or 50% and pull out.

I've been doing it for years now and it took me a while to get profitable and create a system that works. Once I found a profitable system I have had to evolve it over time as the markets have changed etc. So, it takes a lot of work to actively trade. That's why you see the other subs preaching to just hold.  It takes a ton of time to learn and it can be stressful because money is involved. Yet, if you put in the work and gain confidence in your system it can be worth it.  I literally never stress about trades any more. I typically get 70% of them profitable with a net roi over 20% and my losses are never more then 5%. So, since I track all my trades, and run the numbers as long as my stats don't show a dip then I know I am still working with a profitable system.  Good luck with whatever you decide. I will say that these days I trade stocks, crypto etc all from a skill that I figured out thanks to crypto, but back when I learned it was easier.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SHEwUlpSYzY2ZXQ5bUtxMWVOb2ZBVU9vZFpORjk3dnVQcmI2ZDRMM1hFT2FXcEo5am5xWG92c01tTVZ0WGl5RFBkYWEyamYyWFZ6dnZtUklieGs5Rnc9PQ==

"Good for you for beginning to be in the markets and be financial literate at such a young age.

It’s the type of thing that you need to experience once to have a lasting emotional impact to not do it again. $600 may seem like a ton of money, and it is significant, but it’s nothing you won’t recover from.

"Crypto was not created “so that the average person wouldn’t need Wall Street”. That isn’t the purpose nor the best use case of cryptographic consensus, and the wild price action of crypto is just a byproduct of it being a new asset class. 

Also, do not let yourself think that just because retail investors have more sway over altcoins that somehow the altcoin market should be immune to macroeconomic effects. 

I appreciate the sentiment here, OP, but it is better to realize the truth that the market is all interconnected and cannot be fully peeled off from everything else happening around it.

"Coinbase customer service is garbage.  I opened an account in Oct 23', I would only open the app once a month to buy BTC, never spent, sent or received any. In March of this year, I went to do the same thing I've been doing and I couldn't buy any, I couldn't deposit, I couldn't send receive, get cash out, nothing.  

Using chat, they said I needed to send my ID and a selfie to tech dept for them to review and it would be 3 to 4 days for the review process. I waited 4 days and checked cause I heard nothing and it was still disabled. So again went through chat, was told to do the same thing if and selfie, 3 to 4 days for review.  Waited over a week heard nothing, checked acct nothing changed.  So I try to call was on hold for well over an hour, someone finally picked up and instantly hung up the phone. So back to chat, was told to do the same thing, I refused to do it again this time cause I was pissed.  

They called me a liar, asked me why I buy BTC and what I plan on doing with it. They couldn't clearly see that all I ever did was buy once a month cause one of the idiots told me that. All I was able to do after that is delete my bank info which was a relief but I have a few hundred bucks of BTC in my account and can't do anything with it.

"How long have you been leverage trading? Once bitten by the bug, it can create an itch that can be satisfied by creating the individual that masters the art of comprehensive trading. There’s great ways to use leverage. However, going in 100% has the risk of losing 100%. Recently made 800% on $10, thanks to leverage. With less leverage and higher margin, that could have been a better pay out. But, using extremely high leverage can teach one how to really be patient, because there’s very specific indications that are nearly guaranteed to play in the direction of a trade. I can imagine if you’re like me, you’ll be looking at the charts in a week. Look at the past. There are perfect entries.

'Digital silver' was the term coined by Charlie Lee as the tagline for Litecoin because 1/ it was an easily digestible soundbite for CNBC when crypto started getting coverage and 2/ because Charlie Lee wasn't exactly the brightest bulb in the room and didn't really have much to say beyond that tagline. So tbh it is and has always been a phrase devoid of any real meaning. Does the world need a digital silver?

I invested into BTC and ETH without leverage a year ago. I bought rndr recently with leverage and got liquidated because I got greedy and tried to recover my losses. You could hold it until it raises again but that’s only if it doesn’t hit your liquidation price.

"Representing the international community - Trump is universally seen as a blithering idiot who will probably further divide America by playing on the fears of the poorer social classes, whilst simultaneously bringing in financial policies that shaft those same uneducated classes and help investors/big business. Its the far right playbook used the world over.

But Biden is also a blithering idiot for his stance on crypto. He had such an easy avenue to victory but is now positioning himself to lose up to 40% of the US vote (crypto holders) and create a lot of international bad will from foreign hodlers. Its a very serious issue and one that should be bipartisan. The libertarians (who heckled trump) have adopted it as theirs, but on the far left... the anarchic anti-gov element have adopted it too.

"Supply liquidity with USDT or USDC (or any combination of both) into a locked 300 day (10 month) stake that pays 0.35% daily. On day 301 you also get your initial stake back.

If you decide to become a member using my invitation link, I may be compensated by the company, at no expense to you.""  With that said and out of the way, Stable Swap is a private group and membership is by invitation only.  Stable Swap allows the opportunity for it's private members to supply liquidity using USDT or USDC (or both, separately, at the required minimums) into a 300 day (10 month) stake/liquidity provision - hereforth (""PROVISION"") that earns 0.35% daily, which is paid daily to your Stable Swap account.  You have the choice to withdrawl your daily earnings from your Stable Swap account (50 USDT or USDC minimum required for withdrawals) to your Metamask wallet, Trust wallet, etc. or compound your interest by re-staking your earnings (25 USDT or USDC minimum required for a 300 day provision). On day 301 of each 300 day provisions you initiate, the amount of the initial provision gets deposited back into your Stable Swap account, where again you can choose to withdrawal (50 minimum) to your Metamask wallet, Trust wallet, etc. or re-stake it into a new 300 day provision. (25 minimum).  I started with Stable Swap on May 12, 2024 and staked a total of 10,000 USDT so far (1000 May-12, 1000 May-13, 1000 May-16, 1000 May-19, 6000 May-22) and I've earned over 1200 USDT in the past 34 days.  On May-23 I reached the point where my daily earnings exceeded the 25 USDT minimun required to initiate a new 300 day provision, so I've been able to initiate a new 300 provision every day since then, currently over 50 USDT daily at the time of this writing, and that daily amount will continue to grow every day because now I'm making interest on my interest (compound interest) daily for the next 300 days and beyond, since May-23.  I'm able to do this daily!  What happens on the last day of my 300 day provision.  Well, on day 301 of each provision (which I start a new provision daily so starting April 23 I'll have a provision maturing daily), the initial (Day 1) amount of each matured 300 day provision is returned/deposited  into my Stable Swap account, in which I plan to re-stake into a new 300 day provision, which will continue on a daily basis as each daily provision I'm initiating every day matures on their respective ""day 301"", now add each of those amounts to the daily earnings from all the other provisions that haven't matured yet, while older ones will be maturing daily at that point.  Is the light bulb coming on yet??  Compound interest is the most powerful force in the financial arena, and I prefer to have it work to my advantage instead of to the advantage of banks and credit card companies where they use compound interest against me.  I made a Facebook page for the purpose of sharing this opportunity with a wider audience that's also a more time efficient way of sharing it.  Stable Swap is a private group and membership is by invitation only.  I welcome everyone to visit my FB page and watch the 2 min video.

The whole point of crypto is that, once you have it, you can use it 24/7, with no barrier to trade for other cryptos or use it within the ecosystem for some service like DeFi, Gaming, DePin etc.  So as money flows into any part of the crypto ecosystem, it trickles outwards into the rest of the ecosystem as there is very little friction.  

There are plenty of actual people using some of this stuff.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4akpLLXhsc3FtUkdBaDNYRkk4N2stU0tCRVBDc1NvM1lWUy1fVzYwWGRMOWFFVzdtZDJLM0FrbzEzYVBnZS1WU0pFSW92YmY5OGY5Q0FBODVkQjRNY1E9PQ==
"BTC is leader. 

When many cryptos move in the same direction simultaneously, it's primarily due to a combination of market dynamics, investor behavior, and the structure of the crypto market. Market sentiment, regulatory news, technological developments, market trends, and just general economic conditions, such as inflation fears or economic recovery, influence investor behavior across all markets, including crypto, all play a role in price action. When Bitcoin experiences significant price changes, investors are adjusting their positions to accomdate current market conditions. Many cryptos share liquidity pools on exchanges, meaning that movements in one can affect the others. 

With the advancement in technology, we also have algorithmic trading, meaning people are using trading bots and algorithms that follow momentum strategies which can simultaneously buy or sell multiple cryptos based on trends and signals, leading to synchronized movements. And with ETF's now the main focal point of institutional trading, Institutions managing large portfolios often move in and out of multiple cryptos at once, causing broad market shifts, sometimes causing market manipulation by whales coordinating  buying or selling multiple assests. Which then brings in psychological, so the whole FOMO or FUD gets in people's heads and irrational trading happens, causing prices to be volatile. 

While it's not rigged, it can be altered to people's favor at any given time. Just be willing to invest what your comfortable losing, in the event of a loss. Store your cryptos off exchange and seed phrases / codes in a safe place, and ride the wild ride we're all strapped into.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4YlpUX1hZczFBbm90Y1IxeWlYWjE3MG9nUTU0TFlKN2RZd1g5OHZCQTduRHBWZEJ2Q0l5OW9aM21pRTRYTThpa2NueVBKSWRteWFlS01vaEpqRldVR3c9PQ==

"It's actually really simple - crypto is 95+% pure speculation, its entire value derives from speculation. In 10 years there might be serious fundamental value to a certain chain eg Eth because of its maturity, or dot for its interoperability. But for the foreseeable future the value of crypto as an entire asset class is almost entirely purely speculative, based on what people believe it will one day be (as opposed to what Tesla stock is right now - they make cars that sell for money that you can buy goods with). This means all crypto is the same asset class for economic purposes, but additional speculation and manipulation within crypto generates this wildly amplified volatility, but fundamentally all chains and protocols facilitate the movement of value (crypto), so their value is pegged to crypto the asset class. Bitcoin is simply the largest component of that asset class.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4MzV0SmhCbXhjckVIaEpELTFKZ1JjdU5sMXBKY2xCVjhmcVJLU3IzNzFYNldQbUhkMzlOeTA2cFZJY3RBajItYkZVUG1NaW5LZU9Da0ozTjA3YnEybXc9PQ==

Any and all memecoins have a chance of skyrocketing in value and while I have heard of a few different analysis tools for picking memecoins winners that have been quite accurate, I don’t ever invest in them. Why? Because while they may or may not skyrocket in value, every single one of them is going to dump hard when they run out of steam because fundamentally they represent the true gambling aspect of this space. They are all fluff and no real value of any kind other than name recognition and meme appreciation.

"#Tether Pro-Arguments
Below is a Tether pro-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> [USDT](https://tether.to/en/transparency/) is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) issued by Tether, a Hong Kong-based company. The token is pegged to the USD by keeping reserves of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills equal to the number of USDT in circulation. Initially named as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin's blockchain using the Omni platform, it was later renamed USTether and, finally, USDT. In addition to Bitcoin, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **USDT is well established**
> 
> It has built a long history of resilience, reliability and trust because it has been around for a [while](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-23780) (around 8 years in the cryptocurrency market). This had helped to convince clients that the stablecoin is [legitimate](https://www.certik.com/projects/tether?utm_source=CMC&utm_campaign=AuditByCertiKLink).
> 
> As of this year, USDT currently is in the top ten cryptocurrencies by [market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether) with a 24-hour trading volume of around 45 billion dollars and a total number of addresses of up to 4.5 million. In its last known [audit](https://www.fairyproof.com/doc/111.pdf) in 2021 it has been considered to have *""No vulnerabilities with critical, high, medium or low-severity.""*
> 
> **Wide acceptance**
> 
> Tether has multiple gateways for customers (retail, exchanges, and companies) because it is built on several leading [blockchains](https://tether.to/en/supported-protocols), including Algorand, Avalanche, Bitcoin Cash's Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), Ethereum, EOS, Liquid Network, Omni, Polygon, Tezos, Tron, Solana, and Statemine. These transport protocols are made up of open source software that interfaces with blockchains to allow for the issuance and redemption of Tether tokens.
> 
> Furthermore, it has been available on major exchanges such as Bitfinex, Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and [more](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether#markets), Offering a plethora of pairs for users to choose from or that of which is available in their region although as of lately some exchanges have been switching to Circle's USDC over growing concerns of legal issues related with Tether.
> 
> **Buffer against volatility**
> 
> One of the primary functions of stablecoins is to act as a [hedge](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341245986_Are_stablecoins_truly_diversifiers_hedges_or_safe_havens_against_traditional_cryptocurrencies_as_their_name_suggests) when crypto markets are in a downturn. Because the aforementioned market is extremely volatile, traders and investors want some sort of buffer against this without having to directly trade their crypto for fiat as to also avoid larger fees as well. Supported by its large market capitalization, USDT should be less volatile and thus safer.
> 
> **Announcement of a full audit**
> 
> Tether's CTO Paolo Ardoino recently stated in an [interview](https://www.euromoney.com/article/2a8dpi4tnxahuu98a251c/fintech/cryptocurrencies-tether-is-open-to-providing-more-information) with Euromoney that the company is preparing for a full audit with an accounting firm called MHA Cayman (which also handles Tether's [quarterly assurance opinions/reports](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/1np5dpcwuHrWJ4AgUgI3Vn/e0dac722de3cea07766e05c52773748b/Tether_Assurance_Consolidated_Reserves_Report_2022-03-31__3_.pdf)). According to the CTO in the interview, MHA Cayman is one of the ""*top 12*"" accounting firms, and most top accounting firms deny requests for full audits due to the associated reputational risks. In the future, hopefully, this will provide more security and transparency to its users against the number of allegations and investigations it is currently facing.
> 
> **Despite everything, USDT is still here**
> 
> From the past legal troubles it has faced, the ones it's facing right now, the vast amount of criticisms from different facets off the internet and the several crypto winters it endured. USDT is still alive and kicking. Will it still be the top stablecoin in the next 5 years? Unlikely, but I am for certain it was a major part for the growth and expansion of crypto's fetal years. Moving forward it's up to them, the people behind Tether, if they will finally redeem themselves against all the allegations, criticisms, troubles, and not just do another settlement.

"#Tether Con-Arguments
Below is a Tether con-argument written by a deleted user.

> **Tether Cons**
> 
> **Dodgy Reserves**
> 
> Initially, Tether asserted that each USDT was backed by a dollar in its reserves. But the truth is more nuanced, Tether is supported by a variety of:
> 
> * Other Investments (Including Digital Tokens): 8.36%
> 
> * Secured Loans(None To Affiliated Entities): 6.77%
> 
> * Corporate Bonds, Funds & Precious Metals: 5.25%
> 
> * Cash & Cash Equivalents & Other Short-Term Deposits & Commercial Paper: 79.62%
> 
> Of the 79% cash and cash equivalents, only 10.25% is held in cash. Also to be emphasized is the lack of an independent audit of the specific breakdown of Tether's reserves.
> 
> **Regulatory Issues**
> 
> The Paradise Papers dump in 2017 revealed that Bitfinex and Tether are both controlled by the same individuals. The Bitfinex trading platform's owners, who also manage the tether virtual currency, have participated in a cover-up to conceal the apparent loss of $850 million dollars, according to the investigation conducted by the New York state Attorney General. Later, Tether's attorney acknowledged that only 74% of the Tether is backed. Tether is forbidden from conducting business in New York under the terms of the settlement agreement. Despite paying a $18 million punishment, Bitfinex and Tether did not confess any wrongdoing.
> 
> **Competitors**
> 
> * USDC: Circle and Coinbase launched USDC in 2018, and it is tied 1:1 to the US dollar. Issuers are also required to back all tokens with fiat reserves and provide monthly proof of reserves in order to guarantee that USDC maintains a continual one-to-one backing.
> 
> * BUSD: BUSD is a stablecoin backed by USD that is 1:1 secure, compliant, and supported by Binance. It was created by Paxos and has NYDFS approval. To preserve the stability and security of the stablecoin, Paxos hires an auditing company to examine its BUSD and US Dollar supply each month.

"#Solana Pro-Arguments
Below is a Solana pro-argument written by a deleted user.

> #PROs
> 
> This is the Pros section of [my analysis on Solana](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/vk42tn/solana_research_june_2022/)
> 
> ##Low Transaction Fees
> 
> Solana has very low transaction fees at about $0.0002 / transaction. They could still increase the fee schedule by ~40x before exceeding penny in cost. That's mainly because the fees are subsidized by staking rewards paid to powerful validators, which then contribute to ongoing SOL token [inflation of ~7%](https://messari.io/screener/supply-and-marketcap-EB1755C2) as of 2022.
> 
> ##Moderately-high TPS
> 
> The true TPS limit of Solana over the past year after subtracting invalid transactions and vote transactions is [about 400-600](https://dashboard.chaincrunch.cc/public/dashboard/cc7a0d94-7f70-46f4-aae4-2f8810430931#theme=night). It's not anywhere close to their marketed throughput of 50K TPS, but it's still moderately-high for a smart contract network.
> 
> ##Centralization is not as bad as the reputation
> 
> Solana has a very bad reputation for being centralized as **SQL**ana. It's actually not that centralized. There are currently 1900 validators, and the Nakamoto Consensus for shutting down the Solana network (needs 33% staked) is [currently 33 validators](https://solanabeach.io/validators).
> 
> On the other hand, there's almost no information about the identity of these validators, so it's still possible they're mostly centrally-owned by the foundation. We just don't know.
> 
> ##Outage and stability issues likely to be resolved by 2 upcoming updates
> 
> The days of making fun of Solana for their outages could be coming to an end. Solana is working on [2 major updates](https://decrypt.co/103106/solana-new-gas-fees) that are meant to mitigate outages and provide stability to the network.
> 
> **QUIC** replaces UDP for Solana's IP and Transport layer protocols. [QUIC] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) provides flow control, allowing nodes to throttle incoming traffic when there's too much from both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks.
> 
> **Localized Fee Prioritization** allows Solana to dynamically charge higher fees for specific high-demand transactions. When a dApp or NFT project is congesting the network, the fee will rise for that app without affecting the rest of the network. This is a really cool solution I'd love to see other networks copy.
> 
> ##Lots of DeFi projects
> 
> There are a ton of DeFi projects on Solana. It has 39 DeFi projects above $1M in TVL. [DeFiLlama shows Solana at $1.4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/chains), which puts it between Tron and Arbitrum at #6.

"#Solana Con-Arguments
Below is a Solana con-argument written by a deleted user.

> **Solana Cons**
> 
> **Centralization**
> 
> An estimated 1,700 validator nodes support Solana. If a single entity or collection of entities comes to possess a sizable portion of the SOL token supply, the Solana network may become unduly concentrated. The network's decentralization may suffer because Solana requires more specialized equipment to join and is unable to draw a sizable user base. There is a high concentration of stakes among validators, with 22 validators controlling 33% of total staked SOL. Accordingly, if 22 validators conspired, the network might theoretically come to an end.
> 
> **Network Outages**
> 
> * September 14,2021: 15 Hours of outage as bots capitalized on an IDO on raydium
> 
> * January 2022: The whole month faced partial outages of 6-12 per day due to high demand of NFT minting and defi usage.
> 
> * April 30, 2022: 7 Hour outage due to a DDOS attack by bots
> 
> **Solana, the token**
> 
> The token distribution on Solana reveals that the top 0.04% of addresses, or around 3,000 addresses outright, hold 88.5% of the current outstanding SOL. Along with early investors and the founding team, these wallets also contain staking pools and exchanges. 11.7 million SOL are included in the biggest wallet. Less than 1% of the outstanding SOL is held by the bottom 98.6% of wallets on Solana.

"#Solana Pro-Arguments
Below is a Solana pro-argument written by a deleted user.

> **Solana Pros**
> 
> **Proof-of-History**
> 
> The development and use of the Proof-of-History consensus method, which enables Solana to achieve extraordinarily fast network speeds, is the most notable competitive advantage of the Solana blockchain. The sole purpose of this method was to raise TPS more than leading networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Due to the time normally needed to obtain consensus and properly organize the blockchain in response to time passing, proof of history helps other networks' scalability issues.
> 
> **Transaction fees**
> 
> Solana has a block size of 20,000 transactions and block time of 0.4 seconds. The Solana network offers an exceptionally cheap transaction cost of just 1c per transaction, which is made possible by the greater block time and block size. Solana is now among the blockchains with the lowest transaction costs because to this cost.
> 
> **NFTs**
> 
> Currently, NFTs account for a sizable portion of why individuals use these networks. The major factor behind Solana's NFT ecosystem's rapid expansion is the network's scalability, which enables it to handle transactions effectively. Ethereum can only handle 15 transactions per second, whereas Solana can process 50,000. This is important information for users to know because sluggish network speed also equates to expensive costs. The freedom that artists enjoy with their NFT works on Solana is enormous. This is mostly caused by the other blockchains' technical shortcomings. Fast processing times and affordable prices enable artists to produce works that, for instance, would be too expensive to mint on Ethereum.

"#Solana Con-Arguments
Below is a Solana con-argument written by a deleted user.

> **Solana Cons**
> 
> **Centralization**
> 
> An estimated 1,700 validator nodes support Solana. If a single entity or collection of entities comes to possess a sizable portion of the SOL token supply, the Solana network may become unduly concentrated. The network's decentralization may suffer because Solana requires more specialized equipment to join and is unable to draw a sizable user base. There is a high concentration of stakes among validators, with 22 validators controlling 33% of total staked SOL. Accordingly, if 22 validators conspired, the network might theoretically come to an end.
> 
> **Network Outages**
> 
> * September 14,2021: 15 Hours of outage as bots capitalized on an IDO on raydium
> 
> * January 2022: The whole month faced partial outages of 6-12 per day due to high demand of NFT minting and defi usage.
> 
> * April 30, 2022: 7 Hour outage due to a DDOS attack by bots
> 
> **Solana, the token**
> 
> The token distribution on Solana reveals that the top 0.04% of addresses, or around 3,000 addresses outright, hold 88.5% of the current outstanding SOL. Along with early investors and the founding team, these wallets also contain staking pools and exchanges. 11.7 million SOL are included in the biggest wallet. Less than 1% of the outstanding SOL is held by the bottom 98.6% of wallets on Solana.

"I don't understand how a gold-backed, dollar-pegged coin is fundamentally fiscally sound. If the value of gold goes down related to $1 USD, then who is paying for the extra gold needed to maintain full ""gold-backed"" status? Is Tether saying that it will buy the extra gold to maintain the fully gold-backed status?   
For example, if you buy $2,400 worth of Alloy, and that requires 1oz of gold to be gold-backed, which is fine in the opening transaction, Tether/Alloy buys 1oz of gold and your Alloy coin is 100% backed by gold; however, if the price of gold:USD goes to $1,800 USD per oz, then your $2,400 of Alloy coin is only 75% backed by gold (1 oz gold now is only worth $1,800).. so is Tether going to buy another .33oz of gold out of their treasury to maintain the 100% gold-backed status?

"#Cardano Pro-Arguments
Below is a Cardano pro-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> Cardano is a public blockchain platform that is open-source, decentralized, and runs on a proof-of-stake algorithm. ADA is the name of their native currency. Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, spearheaded its launch in 2015. ([1](https://docs.cardano.org/introduction))
> 
> # PROs
> 
> **The Founder**
> 
> * Charles Hoskinson is to Vitalik Buterin as Cardano is to Ethereum regardless of their current rankings by marketcaps. Although the reason for Charles being removed from Ethereum was due to a disagreement between him and Vitalik, Charles still had some kind of influence, intellect, and charisma to be one of the founders of Ethereum. It would be still very possible that he is applying the same principles and approach into Cardano. ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hoskinson), [3](https://newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/22/the-prophets-of-cryptocurrency-survey-the-boom-and-bust))
> 
> **Greener with Orouborus**
> 
> * Network participants run nodes in this context, and the chain chooses a node to add the next block based on the node's stake and other parameters. As a result, the main benefit of this consensus is that block producers do not need to spend excessive amounts of time and computer power solving random puzzles, resulting in less costs for mining rigs, less energy consumption, and less e-waste production. The environment is just as important as decentralization and proof of stake seems to have the better long term and sustainable answer for crypto. ([4](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/17/why-they-re-calling-cardano-the-green-blockchain/), [5](https://www.independent.co.uk/space/cardano-crypto-bitcoin-elon-musk-b1849021.html))
> 
> **Less Centralized**
> 
> * Cardano presently has around 3,300 staked pools operated by various users/organizations from their community. Every block and transaction is validated by any of these users participating within the community and without the reliance from any centralized authority. If any of these participants attempt to act in a way that resembles of a centralized entity then they will be issued with penalties that would be no benefit for them and still protect the network. ([6](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/why-use-cardano), [7](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/proof-of-stake), [8](https://docs.cardano.org/new-to-cardano/cardano-nodes))
> 
> **Other Points**
> 
> * Over the past few months Cardano has slowly integrated itself in Africa in helping solve real-life problems by offering the technology within Cardano. One of their most notable plan was using the blockchain as tool in the betterment of the supply chain in the African market. ([9](https://emurgo.io/cardano-strategy-africa/))
> * The Mary Hard-fork implemented last year allows Cardano to tranform from being just a single-asset ledger to a multi-asset ledger. To summarize, this means that there will be new assets traded on the Cardano blockchain that aren't native. Native tokens, like ERC-20 tokens that can be created and transacted on the Ethereum network, will provide Cardano with similar functionality.

"#Cardano Con-Arguments
Below is a Cardano con-argument written by CreepToeCurrentSea.

> Cardano is a public blockchain platform that is open-source, decentralized, and runs on a proof-of-stake algorithm. ADA is the name of their native currency. Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, spearheaded its launch in 2015. ([1](https://docs.cardano.org/introduction))
> 
> # CONs
> 
> **The Pointperson**
> 
> * Bitcoin worked so well due to one of the facts that its supposed creator/founder stayed anonymous until Satoshi finally went offline and never came back. The problem with Cardano also resonates with much of the other crypto projects/networks, that having a publicly exposed leader/founder leaves the project open to criticisms and especially linked damages incurred if a said founder would be found out to have some issues/scandals. - Humans always have some imperfection in them no matter how genuine and brilliant they are or how perfect they look. Hoskinson is no exception, no one is. ([2](https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/why-charles-hoskinson-was-shamefully-kicked-out-of-ethereum-8b29faa5cd14), [3](https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-under-fire-for-not-dropping-out-of-a-phd-program))
> 
> **Complexity can Slow Things Down**
> 
> * While most of the blockchains in crypto use object-oriented programming language like Java and Rust, Cardano uses Haskell which is a function-based programming. With this. Haskell has more complexities as a language and as a result less known developers. The complexity of Haskell is an asset to Cardano for being using a unique language but it's hindering their development while other blockchains are speeding up their growth. ([4](https://www.cryptoeq.io/corereports/cardano-abridged#technology))
> 
> **Too Much Competition**
> 
> * Cardano runs on a proof-of-stake consensus, a consensus that right now is highly crowded with other blockchains and just like these other blockchains, all are catching up to Ethereum. Cardano ranks 29th in Total Value Locked compared to other staking blockchains and $6.1K daily fees generated while Ethereum has a whopping $2.1M daily. Fees are critical for a blockchain's long-term health and sustainability because they provide economic security as issuance/inflationary rewards diminish over time. This is clearly a great difference due to the lack of development and lack of usage in the Cardano Network relative to the growth of other chains in the same consensus. ([5](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CARDANO_Building-Block.pdf), [6](https://defillama.com/chains), [7](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/metrics/revenue))
> 
> **It's Dependent on these Three**
> 
> * Since 2015, Cardano has been primarily controlled and developed by three distinct entities. IOHK, the Cardano Foundation, and EMURGO are among those involved. IOHK is the development branch responsible for Cardano's design, built, and maintenance. The Cardano Foundation works like a liaison of education and information that works to increase network adoption through education, promotion, and representation of the ecosystem. Finally, EMURGO, Cardano's commercial branch, acts as a bridge to help invite existing companies to the technology as well as invest in it and assist startups that want to build applications within the Cardano ecosystem. These three entities are crucial for the survival and growth of Cardano, if one or two of these entities fail then it will be detrimental to Cardano, leaving it last in the race for dethroning Ethereum.

They are setting you up to be “pig butchered”. 

You can go browse r/scams and see where it is happening to people every single day. 

It’s the same thing every time. They Meet a  “woman” online, become very friendly, friend eventually mentions how much money they are making trading crypto and want to help you make money too. 

The websites are all faked and it gives you the illusion you are making money but whenever you finally go to withdraw your millions you’re gonna have to deposit thousands of dollars more to “cover the fee”. 

These scams are designed to take every single dime you own and then the “friend” will encourage you to take loans or do whatever to get more money.

"The things that made the main difference for me:

1) Becoming an investor instead of a trader.

As a trader I was trying to guess the direction of my positions over the next few hours, but that didn’t have anything to do with the fundamental value of the projects, that felt like trying to guess the next wind gust while in a hurricane. I would panic as soon as I was losing any amount of money and that isn’t sustainable. 

As an investor, I realize it’s impossible to buy a coin and expect to always be in profit. Price action whips back and forth, often based on no news about the project at all. I learned to analyze projects and determine if they are undervalued compared to where I think they should be relative to the rest of the market, and it’s this kind of analysis that has made me a great sum of money.

2) Developing conviction before deploying money. 

This is the reason I don’t buy an memecoins. Could I make more money if I did? Yeah, maybe, but I have zero conviction in them and I wouldn’t be able to hold on to them. If I bought TURBO today and it went to zero I couldn’t even be surprised because it, like the majority of crypto projects, is absolute garbage as a project. The crypto world became way, WAY easier for me when I started to realize what aspects of crypto projects make them actually valuable in the first place. Also, watching the market through COVID helped me. I watched in real time as the Bitcoin price fell off a cliff in March 2020 and then rebounded. If that didn’t kill crypto then it’s going to take way more than an unfavorable Fed meeting to kill it. 

3) Only investing up to the point where it starts to feel uncomfortable and not past that. 

I have seen the phrase “invest only what you’re willing to lose” stated here a bunch of times, but it feels a bit disingenuous. I’m not a gambler, I look at my investments as bets towards what is going to be big 2-5 years from now and I do actually buy when the price of each of my assets is down and everyone is saying “crypto is dead”. This happens all the time, and crypto is never actually dead. Never FOMO into a project that is pumping, buy when projects are on sale, and take your time adding to positions. It takes time to get used to seeing your positions move up and down all the time.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEMm1RVF9jQUR0eWJvc1I3WWEtNzZsd1RkVndMbVFhWFVNQjJEVkRaNjhuT1NyZ0NFSjBjb2tWZTNQbkhZbU1XY1hxZ25namtPU0Rxa2RXMlluUDJBU1RmVVJPQk85T3JIUlNYMnQ4cXh5S1k9

"""I'm stepping away from this market until I can learn some discipline.""  When a trade goes against you and you close it out and then it reverses right back, then you panicked.  When a trade goes against you and you close it out and then it keeps moving against you, then you were disciplined.  It's as simple as that.

That's a bit of a joke, as a trader definitely needs trade entry and exit discipline and risk management discipline.

However, if you cannot rationally and reasonably explain why you have an edge over the general market you cannot expect to make money trading other than by pure luck...which is usually fleeting. 

This begs the question are you trading or investing?  I no longer trade, I invest.  I made a very good living for over 15  years trading options professionally.  At the end it took me a few years to realize that my edge was gone, no longer definable and wasn't coming back!  Bottom line though, if you are trading in and out of anything, why should you make money vs the other side your trade?  Can you really reasonably define why?

"It takes a lot of experience to be able to interpret how the market is behaving. For instance, this current crypto market is seeing the death of most of the cryptos we all know. That’s why we are seeing them do 88 and 98% retracements from their recent runs… they just have no conviction. This sentiment is different for each bull run as we have had different factors going into each.

In crypto it’s never a good idea to “invest”. You may end up losing most of what you put in because these projects are dead and never going anywhere. The best strategy is make entries when prices are low… very low. Like I said before, when prices are like 88-98% down from highs. That’s when you get in.

Another thing about timing is that you don’t need to always be trading. If you had waited for lower prices, you’d be in a better position. Also, while -20% movements are NORMAL for crypto, set stop losses. You really don’t want to be down more than 20-25% on something .., that’s a lot and will be a while (or never) to see it back there again. 

Bitcoin and ethereum I would say are the only ones you can just ride through the pain. Eventually they come back.

One last thing is timeline. New investors should be looking at timelines that are in the months. If you buy Bitcoin today, expect to ride the good and bad days for a while. Say, 6 months or 12 months.

"by understanding the nature of crypto markets - HIGH volatility

risk management, risk tolerance, market psychology. specialize in a specific set of niches in crypto - that way you can see when certain projects are undervalued compared to others. 

  
For instance: solana > memecoins/NFTs OR AI OR gaming, and so on

Ethereum > RWAs OR memecoins OR gaming, etc, etc. 

Cardano > cardano alts

Avalanche > avax alts

Believe it or not, there are degens thats specialize in memecoins. There are people that specialize in DeFi, RWA's, Gaming, AI coins, Bitcoin ordinals/runes, whatever category you can have an understanding of.

"> I'm stepping away from this maket until I can learn some discipline.

That's wise.

I'll never forget the covid crash in March 2020.  Bitcoin was plunging.  $1k down.  $2k down.  $3k, $4k, $5k... down down down.  That would be like seeing a $40k drop now.

Lots of people sold and then got crushed when Bitcoin rebounded.

What did I do?  I turned off my monitor, shut off my phone, and I walked away for a while.  I held, and I'm glad.

I've posted this before, but it's worth repeating:

**Don't be your own worst enemy.**

Every 4 year halving-to-halving cycle sees so many people sell, chasing quick cash, only to realize they'll never be able to buy as much Bitcoin as they used to have.

Owning 100 BTC in 2012 was nothing. How many people still owned 100 BTC in 2016? Very few. Most sold. Now, they tell stories about what they used to have.

Owning 10 BTC in 2016 was no big deal. How many people still owned 10 BTC in 2020? Very few. Most sold, but they probably don't talk about it.

Owning 1 BTC back in early 2020 wasn't that big of a deal. How many people still own 1 BTC today? Very few. Most sold and can only wish they were still whole coiners.

How many of those who own 0.1 BTC today will still own at least 0.1 BTC in 2028? Many will lose it by trying to time the market.

People keep selling, thinking they'll buy back in when the price drops lower, because of course they will, right? But that money's long gone when the price drops because when they had money in the bank, they spent it. And that assumes the price keeps dropping. There will come a time when buying Bitcoin under 70k will seem like the good old days.

Hold on to what you have.

"What was your entry into crypto? My impression is that many of us start by getting orange pilled via something like the *Hidden Secrets of Money* series by Mike Maloney. Some of us stay BTC maxis and some are willing to branch out to altcoins. Either way, we come to realize the difference between money and currency. Money is a store of value over time. What we tend to think of as ""money"" in fiat is really just currency that loses its value due to inflation.  Does this mean we should put our entire life savings of currency into one memecoin on Solana? Ofc not. We should still respect and appreciate what we have.

There's lots of great advice here from others. Time spent in the market > trying to time the market. Investing > trading. The list goes on, but I believe they're all secondary principles derived from a deeper theme.  I'm talking about being consciously aware that currency is losing its value, so we should try to allocate it towards something that either retains value or appreciates in value across the span of one or more cycles.

Admittedly, we all roll our eyes at anyone who says they're purely here for the tech and underlying philosophies. People who say they're here solely for the money (though they mean fiat) are at least being honest. The problem for them is they're at a greater risk of being tossed around by their own emotions and being manipulated by P&D influencers since obviously they place fiat on a pedestal. In a similar vein, there are people who invest in crypto despite believing that it's worthless and a bunch of ""air"" as Warren would put it.

My question to them would be, ""Do you really want to invest based entirely on the greater fool theory?"" Granted, in some technical sense, we're all in a game of musical chairs where we take turns being exit liquidity for each other. Even when you buy a bag based on ""fundamentals,"" whoever buys your bag later is your exit liquidity.  If that frame brings somebody success, cool. My concern would be that such an individual would become so obsessed over who is the exit liquidity that they can't see the wood for the trees. I personally believe you'll get rekt if you don't have conviction and don't see any value in your investments. If you're in such a hurry to hand off your bag of ""air"" to your exit liquidity, then you could be missing out life changing gains. *Oh shit, I don't want to be left holding this bag full of shit / air!*  Sure, that works if you're jumping in and out of a P&D scamcoin on a DEX somewhere, but you need to ask yourself if you hold those underlying views and are applying them to the long-term cycle.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFNmhPUktONm1QclY1ZmtHLTZ4WkhMLW5pOVpRdmU1di1xNGZ0ekZmOV8wU0xCQ1pZclIzVFoycE4xQ0RPSnBrVVJ2SUx3YVlvbW4yTDVkZUc5Q2dQUWc9PQ==

"1. Do research on when market is at bottom. A rough bottom is actually quite easy to spot (I mean there was a period of a few months, where the crypto market was hovering at -75% from ATH in late '22) and so far (pre-ETF), crypto has been very cyclical. DCA from there and graduate out of DCAing as market picks up. If you do this you won't stress as much, instead of just aping into projects because they are suddenly on Tier1s and all over socials. The next bottom, if the cycle format continues, will be between late '26 and mid '27 (most likely).
2. Crypto is risky. Never put in more than you are afraid to lose. 
3. Do you believe in your projects (do they bring anything new to the space, are the development teams active, do they have social media buzz and strong community?). If it's a solid project then wait for liquidity to come back into market (there is always shakiness, profit taking and consolidation after the halving).
4. Have realistic expectations of returns (market as a whole is only projected to 5x from here, ofc some projects will momentarily pump way more than that).  Try to get your initial cost basic out as quicky as possible (for me, I take 1/1.5x out when a project hits 5x, and so im never stressed about losing money).",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFMGRjLUJDMFpFV3JtRFNKUXlwNXhyWkV2OTQxdHhLTU5SbUxNa2wxWEFWSzZKX3ZMeV9sdWJBMEd6YmxiZ24yenhwbDhIc00yZG9MN3I5S2Fjb3VDQnNabDZvMkUzeG52YnBwRXpoMkpuSlU9

"If you are looking for a project with a proven product already in the wild, with a team that has consistently delivered, I would highly recommend researching Zypto app/Zypto pay and their token $Zypto, where token holders receive a share of ALL REVENUE transacted through their payment gateway. The app is amazingly easy and straight forward to use, unlike other Defi wallet apps available. I personally think their in-app cross-chain swap is the best feature, but there are many other unique features to explore. In your research, don’t miss their first Global Integration Partnership (affectionately called the “Dubai Deal” by the team, because that is where the deal was signed). Zypto is currently integrating their payment gateway into a Fortune 500 company’s payment system(undisclosed due to NDA in the contract). The deal was signed just 30-days ago after extensive contract negotiations and corporate red tape. This project has flown under the radar, which will not last much longer.

"Exercise extreme caution with questions like these. Scammers are obvious but there are also shills who push their latest memecoin hoping to create liquidity while they offload.


Your best bet is to invest in the big basics like BTC, ETH, and native tokens for chains you believe will be successful over time. I’d urge you to look at the price charts for Solana before listening to the people saying to put money there. Solana price is being artifically propped up by a massive wave of celebrity scam tokens and is around its all-time-high….. buying now is likely to be buying at the top with a good likelihood of a 90% drawdown back to more typical levels coming. That’s only an educated guess but Solana is trading at prices similar to the late 2021/early 2022 bull run. Consider long term price action or you may get caught holding for two years just hoping to break even.

One recommendation that I didn’t see below is Chainlink. Don’t expect a sudden moon rocket but look into the fundamentals and you will see $LINK already has real world use cases and partners like Google and Associated Press. May not have significant price action for awhile but if you are looking at a longer time horizon the utility provided may turn it into a real winner big picture.



 You may also want to set aside a small portion, say $1k and break it up into 10 $100 lots and throw it at memecoins with a sell order at 10x. Due to the gambling nature of those “projects” they often have ludicrous pumps before crashing. Going in early and seeking a conservative 10x is going to greatly increase your chances of making a profit before the inevitable crash.

Both can be true. If we stay above 60 i will hold all my bags. Of we see two weekly close under 60k i will sell a bit and we can see one ( prob last ) nasty drop.

"It’s already stoped out. 

I don’t disagree that there are forms of leverage trading that are gambling but that’s not what I’m doing. 

Gains network and GMX are paying ARB token rewards for open and close fees on their platform.  

I open and close massive leverage trades generally at a wash and end up farming the rewards.  


Yesterday alone I earned 1,285 ARB tokens just from reward kick backs for opening and closing leverage plays. 

I also use leverage shorts with 1-1.5x leverage to hedge LP farms to create a neutral delta for the price exposure of the farm assets.  

Leverage trading is not just betting on price direction, that would in fact be gambling. 


Thanks for your concern but I am not gambling. Leverage perpetual contracts are just a part of my investment strategy. If anything I would recommend you try some perpetual trading on Gains or GMX since the kick back rewards make the risk profile accessible even for a gamble.

- stocks are going crazy at ATH (election year)
- general state of living & economy is terrible and people are struggling real bad - where will the funding come to take crypto up that far, if day to day expenses are difficult, is crypto the risk worth taking with the funding people have available when prices are at 70k to fomo buy in when the room to pull back feels greater like a Jenga tower.
- if wars are upon us, gold will touch a higher peak and possibly digital gold (Bitcoin) as well being safe heaven asset because the dollar is very slowly being turned away from as the dominant global currency. 
- at such difficult times in business would people transact in crypto risking their business capital on the volatility of it going the wrong way?
- america printed so much money during Covid it avoided a recession but that led to inflation and money becoming less valuable. 
- makes me wonder if Bitcoin even gets to 100k at that point what will the spending power even be of it in USD if the dollar gets screwed because of US debt and economic troubles it’s already facing so intensely.

Reddit may be the among the worst places to go for financial advice. Just dyor and don't trust some rando on the web.

Since we aren’t making any more land, I feel like this will be a coin that a boomer that’s scared to enter crypto will like. They also have a feeder network show called unicorn hunters that’s similar to Shark Tank. The main difference is that the viewers get to invests. So rather than watching 5 already rich sharks get richer, this show allows the viewers to invest. Hosts of the show are Steve Wozniak, Chris Diamantopoulos, Lance Bass, Rosie Rios, Moe Vela, Chris Carter and others. Basically, all the companies that are featured on the show give a little equity to the crypto coin. So the coin is always getting more equity. I think they are filming season 2 now.

"Unfortunately I don’t. I was an investor in their other business, then they pivoted to the show and coin. I got in on the coin because I’m a nobody and I never get an opportunity to get in before an ICO. So to me, the ROI was worth the risk. The shareholder emails have always expressed that their goal was to ICO at $1 per coin, but that’s when their goal was to sell $2 billion in real estate. They blew past that goal, so not sure what the new plan is as they near $4 billion. But dude, locking in over $3 billion is impressive. Think of what these properties will be worth in 5 years or 10 years. I feel like the boomers that love real estate will like this coin. They had a white paper at one point, but it was a bit ago and I’m sure they will update as the market is evolving so quickly. I do like that they are audited and publicly reported. So they are trying to do things the right way in terms of legislation. Plus I don’t have any multimillion dollar properties, so I do get a sense of reassurance that people with that kind of wealth/assets are buying into the coin. They just started an aggressive marketing blitz too. So they are trying to get the coin some buzz. They are being interviewed on financial shows n shit.

"I guess my biggest concern and also that of any boomer or serious investor is the logistics behind tying the value of these properties to this token. 

For starters selling a token with the promise of future profits from the participation in a shared enterprise is a security offering. I don’t see their SEC licenses for doing so. In which case the work around is claiming the tokens being sold are not securities and have no value proposition or expectation of performance.  

Promises of future developments without any existing product or prototypes are risky. I like their pitch but absence or vagueness in the documentation is a red flag.

Projects that set overly ambitious milestones without a clear roadmap for achieving them can be problematic. It’s impressive what they claim to have done so far but the verifiability of those claims is lacking for sure. I’m not looking to trust them if they want those minimum commitments.

"“I hope so” in relation to this being a local bottom not like I’m gonna lose my shirt. 


I leverage short while covering the collateral in kind with 1x leverage. Like short selling 1 BtC @ $64,000 while covering the collateral with 1 BtC. 

A position like this will always be worth $64,000 no matter that happens to the price of bitcoin. 

If the BTC price pumps then my position is still worth $64,000 it’s just gonna be less Bitcoin units. If BTC dumps I still have $64,000 but now denominated as more Bitcoin units. 

So I’m able to lock in my USD value while earning more BTC from funding while not having any risk of liquidation. Why is this a gamble?

"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> &#x200B;
> 
> # Ethereum: Use-case driving value
> 
> Ethereum is a very valuable Blockchain. This blockchain is driven by innovation and utility. To understand what makes Ethereum such a valuable eco-system we need to discuss the inner-working of Ethereum.
> 
> # Introduction: Ethereum explained
> 
> According to [Ethereum.org](https://Ethereum.org) :
> 
> >What is Ethereum?
> 
> Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments, and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy, bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the internet.
> 
> So the topic driving this discussion is badly worded. If we are discussing top coins then we should discuss Ether and not Ethereum. Since Ethereum is such an interesting ecosystem I will treat this argument as a pro Ethereum post. I'd love to see the discussion focused on Ether next time.
> 
> Ethereum is not managed by a single entity nor managed by the Ethereum Foundation but is managed through a decentralized process explained [In their governance page](https://ethereum.org/en/governance/).
> 
> Time for some metrics: Ethereum is currently trading north of 1750 $ and has a circulating supply of 122 millions ETH for a Market cap at around 218 billions
> 
> Let's go back to the quote: ""Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money"". This point is important. Ether is not the only coin which is using the Ethereum blockchain. A lot of value on the Ethereum Blockchain is not in Ether coins. This will be discussed further down. Ethereum is also home to global payment, so Ether and other cryptocurrencies can be used to settle transactions between P2P in a permissionless way.
> 
> Applications called Dapps exist on the blockchain. We are going to discuss all of these aspects. We are also going to tackle NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain.
> 
> Ethereum is also completed by L2s. These are going to be mentioned.
> 
> Ethereum has been switched from POW to Asic resistant POW to POS. These are going to be discussed.
> 
> &#x200B;
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to digital money.
> 
> Ethereum strength is that the blockchain is home to many cryptocurrencies. If gas fees are paid in Ether, many tokens have billions circulating in the Ethereum ecosystem. A quick look at Etherscans reveal how strong the ethereum ecosystem is.
> 
> According to [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/tokens) the blockchain has 40 Billions $ in USDT, 46 Billions in USDC and 7 Billions $ in Wrapped BTC. The market cap of Ether may be around 200 billions but the on chain value of assets in the Ethereum Blockchain is far higher.
> 
> All of these USDT and USDC are stablecoins which can be used for transactions. In fact, it can be used for P2P transaction in a permissionless way but also to buy stuff from businesses. [Here is a list of business accepting USDT (which exists in the Ethereum blockchain)](https://nowpayments.io/blog/businesses-accepting-tether) and [Here is a list of business accepting directly Ethereum](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-companies-accepting-ethereum-as-a-payment-method-in-2022/)
> 
> These classical transactions are not the only use of the Ethereum Blockchain: Dapps and NFT are also thriving !
> 
> # Ethereum: Home to dapps and NFTs
> 
> Ethereum is home to a lot of different applications: Marketplaces, exchanges, defi, wallets, games...
> 
> These application are different because they are called dapps:
> 
> >A decentralised application (DApp,\\[1\\] dApp,\\[2\\] Dapp, or dapp) is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that run on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system.\\[3\\]
> 
> [Wikipedia Dapps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application)
> 
> To give a glance to these dapps you can head to this website tho be wary of the first dapp listed being an advertisement for shady businesses (I haven't found a better website to source dapps) [Here you go](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/ethereum/1)
> 
> While I don't believe in the current state of NFT technology being viable (See my write up in favor of NFT speaking about the future of this technology), we have to take into account that even after losing 60% of their value there is still 3 Billions USD in NFTs in the Ethereum Blockchain [Source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-nft-collections-lost-nearly-60-of-their-market-cap-in-2022-report)
> 
> # Ethereum: Layers of goodness.
> 
> Ethereum can be a bit expensive for people, this is why it was layered. There are side chains existing just to be cheaper than Ethereum while offering bridges to and from Ethereum. For example Polygon.
> 
> >Polygon is a Layer-2 scaling solution created to help bring mass adoption to the Ethereum platform. It caters to the diverse needs of developers by providing tools to create scalable decentralized applications (dApps) that prioritize performance, user experience (UX), and security.
> 
> So if you want to be able to evaluate Ethereum you need to go and read about the biggest layer 2 pro and cons.
> 
> [A small list of Ethereum layer 2 given by Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/)
> 
> # Ethereum: Evolve to thrive
> 
> Ethereum has been a rapidly evolving ecosystem. It has seen the evolution of mining from GPU to Asic. In order to not become reliant on Asic mining, Ethereum was made Asic resistant. This created other problems: A pressure on the GPU market but also a concern for energy efficiency. In order to improve the footprint but also reduce the fees, Ethereum was made to transistion from POW to POS. Proof of stake is a protocol in which you need to stake coins to run a node in the network.
> 
> This shows an ability to look ahead and to tackle challenges.
> 
> # Conclusion: Ethereum is a rapidly evolving ecosystem which has a lot of value in it. Since Ether is their native coin, all of this impacts Ether's value.
> 
> This is where we go back to the TOP COIN aspect of this write up. Everything I have said has an impact on the value and use of Ether. If you believe in the future of the Ethereum Blockchain, you can go ahead and look a bit more into Ether. If you don't believe in the Ethereum Blockchain then you should try to find a competitor.
> 
> Just know that Ethereum is trying to become deflationary and that their economic outlook seems on par with good cryptos.
> 
> Ethereum is one of the techs of the future and this essay has shown some of the most important aspects of it.
> 
> Have fun !

"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by lj26ft which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

> Ethereum is being shown favoritism and privilege by US regulators. This is the biggest con for Ethereum. Early promoters of Ethereum approached and worked closely with the SEC to shield it from any securities laws. The arguments used by the SEC in the Ripple case can be more easily applied to Ethereum. 
> 
> Why does Ethereum get a free pass from creating a securities offering? Because Joe Lubin started the Brooklyn project before Ethereum even launched. There's multiple threads on this very sub that shows they sold it to more than just developers. I find the hypocrisy and corruption to be the biggest con argument for Ethereum. It's being chosen by the incumbent system as the only standard for web3 so far. I don't think Ethereum would be as highly valued or trusted if it didn't have carte blanche on illegal fundraising/ hosting tens of thousands of illegal securities offerings. 
> 
> The market needs to be a level playing field and right now it's heavily tilted towards Ethereum because of financial interests of early promoters, conflicts of interests from US regulators and their financial interests in Ethereum.

"The whole point of these movements are to squeeze people like you out. People place leveraged trades predicting the market, exchanges and lenders often move the market against these to either get them to close their positions at a loss, pocketing the difference in collateral (likely provided by them) or even better, for them to liquidate these positions entirely, taking all their money as collateral + the lending fee. 

If you buy crypto tokens, buy the ones that show the least volatility and buy consistently over time, never in one shot. Once bought, don’t consider them money so much as your collection of tokens, accumulate those tokens, stake them, lend them. Make them earn more tokens and keep buying. 

Fiat as we know it is in huge flux, the defacto currency of the world is likely to flip, where the money ends up is anyone’s guess but I don’t think everyone is going to want to inherit the Chinese yuan.

"My 2c, don't go chasing waterfalls. As an investment vehicle BTC and ETH should return well over the long-term, but if you're going in with expectations of 10/100x returns then you're likely going to get tripped up chasing those gains with high risk tokens. 

A lot of people on this sub will jump in and say 'nah, I 1000x this shitcoin from a pump last week on Solana' but you aren't going to hear from the thousand or so others (the guys that acted as that guys exit liquidity) that lost money. Most traders lose money, let that part sink in. Gamble with shitcoins, expect to lose money. 

And even within the larger cap tokens there is isn't infinite liquidity to sustain some of these valuations—consider that crypto user growth is only about 6% per year, thats not enough to send every token into an exponential bull market every cycle. More likely many tokens may never see ATH's again, and the market consolidates towards the 'winners' over time. 

The days of (lower risk) exponential returns are long gone imo. The period of initial uptake in 2011-15 was kind of a binary bet—no one was certain crypto would be here to stay, and for that reason there was a relatively large risk on the table but with a relatively sure return should that bet pay off. Crypto isn't really in that phase anymore—if anything it's a 'prove it or lose it' growth investment. For that reason I think it's also a little redundant to talk about specific crypto cycles, I think it's far more tied to the traditional markets and global economic conditions than ever before.

Good luck.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGM1FFRThYa01PN2FuNVM1VzdYT1JpYlhDUFRlbGJQQWRlRklfSlFQZTZWaFgyUV90blFXNmJQalVyV1JrOGVpXzV1bnVNLWFrZEFiVFdaWU1mcmdQelE9PQ==

"Bitcoin and top alts: The days of crazy life-changing gains might be over, but imo it's crazy to not take advantage of this market still right now. I'm a poor person and not an expert by any stretch, but for example the last couple years I've doubled my investment by only messing with BTC and a little dabbling in top alts like SOL (and I probably would be doing better if I hadn't sold as much in 2023, I've been better about identifying the tops in 2024 though).

Meme/get rich quick coins: You can still get huge gains if you pick the right one, and this will always be true. But it's not a fair game to play. With new tokens especially, there are various ways that devs can screw over the holders and it even sometimes happens with tokens that have high scores on sites like TokenSniffer. So not only do you have to research thoroughly (and quickly!) to try to avoid scams, you also have to get lucky enough to have your choice tokens pump.

Conclusion: There are legitimate gains to be had in the safe/top altcoins and Bitcoin.

The percentage of growth will always go down each cycle. This one will be less than the last. That’s the nature of the beast as long as nothing makes it stop existing. But people predicting stuff like a million a coin by 2030 are smoking pipe dreams. Even with inflation it won’t reach a value that’s greater than 50% of the rest of the world. There’s no reason for it to grow that much as it’s pretty much just a Ponzi scheme where you are buying it hoping someone later will pay more for it with no reason for it to be worth more later. The demand is created by articles and influencers saying it’ll hit some crazy number in value by xxxx year. Since it only lives off of this and the hype people can generate off of it and fomo strictly then it doesn’t have a secure future and even with ETFs it’ll flash out eventually. If you want some crazy gains you have to pick the right meme coin before it blows up in value. This is very much gambling but if you know what it is and accept it and don’t try to lie to yourself about what it is than you should be okay. Careful because with this and gambling alike the dopamine rush from a small win outweighs and tricks our minds vs a large loss and makes people create hopium and copium to be able to accept it in a palatable way and not blame themselves. So no you won’t see something like 600% gains from here in any reasonable time (I mean like a cycle) maybe not even 100% more gains from here before it fizzles out and goes into a bear cycle judging by past patterns and trends.,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGbThNT2NsLUQyZ253ZEdWTTVwbEJxTmNKYmxjOEZhRlRqWlMwR25NenNSNTNjSzJKWHZqdGFjMHViaGE1WjYtNmVBUjVMbDVGQU9ZbjdaemFLVmRFNmc9PQ==

"AI is in that speculative bubble right now and EVs were there before that a few years ago. Nvidia went from 100 to 1200 split then to 120 and went to 140 so equal to going from 10 to 140 in a little more than a year. And what we have now is just advanced algorithms that can’t actually create anything new on its own. It doesn’t think like true artificial intelligence would so where it goes from here is very speculative. This speculative bubble is causing a ton of bad imitators that will try to push a quick made bad product out and sell it purely on hype for the space that it’s in. You can see it in there being leading AI programs for stuff like image creation making way more advanced images than the imitators but people will invest and back the imitator hoping they are a disrupter in the industry and prove to be worth the investment. But those winners that aren’t imitating just to make a quick buck but rather innovate and change the industry are diamonds in the rough that are hard to pick out and few in between. 

Now if you can figure out what the next speculative bubble will be before it happens or recognize it and the signs of a huge speculative bubble coming than you can try to invest in that thing before it goes crazy. Nvidia is far overvalued now and the AI speculative bubble is slowing in growth and potentially popping soon so I wouldn’t try there just yet. Not that it won’t see steady decent growth and I don’t mean it isn’t worth slowly investing in (slowly since it’s already grown a ton) but I think more growth is available elsewhere, it just isn’t being spoken about yet.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGaXpzRFh0ZFI2YVVOTHE5RlJvb0RDVHF2cVdZaTlCdHI4aW1pTjJHMnNJZ19iWU5TdmdnRUhWQ195c25LbmVKdXpMVlRMSkNNOE1ISkQ0cjh5ZG14dnc9PQ==

"I do think China’s market in general is primed for a sudden very hard burst upward in value before a sharp decline similar to Japan in the 80s and 90s. They are positioning themselves to make powerful political moves soon with strong threats with tariffs, manufacturing, and spending. Already most games and movies are being made with the thought of “what would China think of this” in the back of their head because that market is so large that even a tiny piece of it is worth it.

India is the other country that is poised to see a ton of growth since they have had such a large population boom and are now seeing more money start to flow into India. Adani is a man with a vision that can lead to a large economic boost for India and a lot of manufacturing is moving from China to India currently as it is. India’s growth will be much slower and would be more akin to buying BTC in the early speculative stages but with a little less risk I think since India is already starting to prove its value and is growing. There will be bursts here and there where it will go up in value and hold most of it and the hard burst up is kind of a decade or two off kind of thing so there’s a lot of time to make investments there.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGMDdlZWpEQVFBTEFUelh2ZWZxalZmM1hvV1RyWERNekVDSXEwVzBLOW9rakFza2h4azlwT1hOZWRLNzRxX2Z4ZzAzRGNXLTRXYkoySm5CZVFCa3kxMUE9PQ==

High beta assets (i.e. things that multiply Bitcoin's move) is risky in the way that you need to get your market-timing right. For example, a DeFi project or DeX can 100-fold your money. But it can absolutely crush down 90% too, if the market conditions turn unfavourable.

High alpha assets are *differently* risky, in that they may have downside volatility, but trend up in the long term.

Finding high *alpha* is hard, but finding high *beta* is easy. 

You also need to think about risk in long time horizons. Predicting price moves within a week is insane, anything can happen. But predicting price moves within a decade is relatively easy, most of the noise cancels itself out.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGMF9qMGRqUlF1dC1SYkRGbzdJa2ctMWZxQmhOWUF2MmNSei1GelJXQy1BTTF1MTlTM2U2a052WmYtU2lOWFhfN0k4S1RsU1JuSldjVWxxNFdxX2Y2V0U2S0s3N1BHcV91WUFIZVprR2RaRnM9

My big risk this run is Drops marketplace.  It’s an erc20 token that has a market for buying and selling locked liquidity and they just partnered with dx sale.  It’s a little funny but it gives devs the opportunity to sell off locked liquidity before it’s freed for them and they also have a lending program against locked liquidity for projects that aren’t liquid enough.  It’s a simple straight forward project that has a pretty massive use case even for just sucking the leftover money out of dead projects.

Floki $FORK.

Floor is in at $1M with 4273 true holders.

Team wallet has held from being worth millions to the bottom with holders.

Poloniex silently loading - a wallet linked to Justin Sun silently loading.

Tier 1 #CEX locked in. Listing with mc increase.

There's a lot going on in the background. Heavy hitters from shib, pepe and doge are holders. They've brought out staking with 5% apy with no lock up times. Take in and out freely. They're bring out a revenue share model which will be paying holders in ETH, which is unreal.

It's extremely hard to find a high reward meme coin that's not a scam or the team won't just bail at the first sign of a down turn. Team wallet was worth over 2 million at ATH and they didn't sell a coin. Huge things coming for FORK.

"The benefit of crypto vs stocks is they behave more like commodities. A stock can have shares printed diluting their value down to zero, so if you see a stock that’s fallen 90% it almost always is going to zero and will never recover. Cryptos have limited supply, so if a crypto has fallen 90% it can and will recover if hype returns to the market. This is evident looking at any long term chart for stocks vs crypto.

Therefore yes, if you buy a big pullback then it’s a reasonable assumption if and when hype returns there will be another bull cycle. “Too late” depends on where in the cycle you’re buying, it’s not about what year you’re buying. Currently the mid and small caps are all down 50% or more from highs so it’s arguably a good time to start a position if you intend to keep adding if things go down further, assuming you believe in the philosophy I’ve just described.

If we’re talking investing trends in general, crypto has had a couple of incredible times in the spotlight, then it was weed stocks, then it was housing, then it was AI, and I predict in the very near future compounding pharmacies selling GLP1 drugs will be the next big thing.

Having said that, again crypto is the only among these that’s immune to dilution. Imagine bitcoin breaks $100k, it doesn’t matter what else is going on media attention will return to crypto. The same can’t be said for any of these other trends. So the best time to buy crypto is when everyone’s attention is focused elsewhere. Which it is right now.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNGMDNRdHdKdnpwc3hPSnBJUDNUNlYtbFhWT3Bxb2hNdFdIV3FjTzVfMXlPZG4wTFlpamxrYnZYXzc1aUVLM253NmJodVhOSlk0ZkhrSngyeXNnbENDckE9PQ==

"Again, I’m new to this too, so don’t take advice from me.

I subscribe to 5-10 popular crypto influencers on YouTube. They all have their favorites and they all have conflicts of interest (AKA they are recommending coins they own trying to pump their own bags) but they will start to give you an overview understanding of large, mid, and low cap coins.

Then, start figuring out what YOU believe in. AI, Gaming, Real World Assets… then start doing your own research parallel to following updates on YouTube.

I don’t recommend aping into any coin just because it’s already pumped 1000%. Inevitably, it will go down —probably right after you buy. Only buy coins you believe in and only invest an amount of money that equals your level of belief. Otherwise you’ll sell at a loss at the first 20% drop.

"I set this sort of service up 2 years ago and have found that people who have money and are serious about investing it, do not want to manage their own funds. 

I had to pivot the business to basically be able to allow clients to invest in the business so the business will manage their funds for them. 

People with real capital, don’t have time to manage an investing portfolio for the most part. They are busy with vacation, boating, skiing, and travel lol. 

You’re targeting a niche of a niche. I still maintain the subscription service along side the investment business but it’s a small community and my fee is $68 per month.

"I started out targeting that crowd too, thinking I could help some people navigate this market and offer things like a private TG with trading signals, custom trading view indicators, and member only documentation and videos. It was a crazy good deal for the $10 a month I charged. 

But that crowd is not interested in such a service, as you can see from your reaction to this post. They are targeted by every scam and BS honey pot scheme on the planet and so are very guarded about joining something like that even when I offered free trials for a month at a time and back test data of the performance of the calls made.  

It does not matter, that audience is not looking to pay any sort of money for anything no matter how valuable it might be. At least that was why I shifted to more serious investors. 

As for charging for the service when you’re making money with the same calls, hell yes! Why would you give it away for free? Why do people seem to feel entitled to it just because you make profit with it yourself already?  100% don’t just do it for free. The people who come for a free service do not convert to paying costumers.  They are looking for free shit only.

"My take is that the big money in crypto has already been made. You’re not going to get the returns that someone who got in early to BTC or ETH early (and who tend to be most bullish) and are up by 100, 1,000 or 10,000x. 

There are undoubtedly opportunities that come up. For instance, being early in ordinals (like NFTs but on Bitcoin) which launched last year had some great opportunities. And there have been some successful meme coins like $PEPE that have had good returns. 

A lot of it really just comes down to timing. And also knowing when to take profits as many things will go up by massive amounts and then tank (think BAYC).

"I wouldn't say there's a single best TA method, but I can tell you what's worked well for me. The MACD is great for confirming those signals, and RSI helps me avoid buying into overbought markets or selling in oversold conditions. Plus, Fibonacci retracement is another tool I love. It’s like a magic tool for identifying support and resistance levels. I use it a lot to spot potential reversal points and plan my entry and exit strategies.

I have adopted this one from the Traders Union. You can visit this one if you want to dig deeper. They have a ton of info on different technical analysis methods. The key thing I've learned is that no single indicator is a magic bullet. It's more about using a combination that makes sense to you and your risk tolerance.

And as you said, staying on top of market news is highly important. Sometimes that outside info can confirm what the charts are hinting at, or give you a whole new view.

Still, it’s all about practice and tweaking your approach as you go. Don’t be afraid to mix and match strategies until you find what works best for you.

"My thoughts:
- Dash has been around since 2014 and is still irrelevant. Lame. 
- It uses X11 which is like a modified Proof-of-Stake consensus… yuck.
- The whole master node thing is intellectually interesting but seems to be very PoS style and allows for coin staking. No thanks. 
- It has interesting features as a privacy coin so I’ll give it a point there I guess.
- Block speed of only one block every 2.5 minutes, that is faster than Bitcoin but still way too slow.

"Dash is probably a better currency than Bitcoin, I’m not refuting that, but I’m proposing something that I believe is quite important: 

Time has proven that Dash is not sufficiently usable enough as a currency for the public to care much. A decade of existence and it only has a market cap of $0.28B means that it’s tiny and does not have a ton of prospects of increasing that position. 

In this case if it were new or particularly novel then I would be interested but its block rate is slow even compared to many Proof-of-Work projects, the fact that it is Proof-of-Stake make it a “rich get richer” coin even though you claim to oppose that mentality, and there’s nothing about the project that makes it uniquely useful as a spending currency compared to other existing options. 

 As for your final statement, the analysis of alternatives here should not be between DASH and memecoins. Meme coins are useless junk in the long term and there are plenty of legitimate projects out there that are trying to solve the blockchain trilemma. 

It’s entirely possible to invest in a cryptocurrency that is valuable as both a store of value AND as a usable peer-to-peer currency, but DASH seems clear to me to not be the answer. 

If you like DASH, by all means buy it, I just don’t personally find it to be compelling given its characteristics.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHejlobkhPOVFwU2ViaVY0enMwTGlxQV9vbXN6cjdnVUFlNzNrOGh5c0VRX0luZ2lDblBDSWtyQ1pZQWhUUXlDNjFqeHB1V01oMzh6X2xaZkJnY2VnX0JhMldHcDFpeEt4YlV4YklBOGp4azg9
"Sorry for the misunderstanding.

I didn't mean to make 50$ from the monthly 20$. That indeed is an absurd and unreasonable profit.

 What i meant is to deposit a monthly amount of 20$ so that it accumulates and while i do so, i try to profit a small percentage from trading crypto. In a daily compound interest calculator i calculated that in order to reach the 50$ profit each month and with 20$ deposits each month, i should have a 3,8 interest / week (in the final month the final balance will be 839$, minus the 240$ that i will have deposited by then ≈ 600$, 600/12=50$). So in the first months of course i will make very small amounts (e.g. in the first month i remember the calculator said that i would make 3$, the second month 11$ etc)

I think that even the 3,8%/week interest is also big for a new investor so even if it is a biweekly profit I wouldn't be mad.

"Look at the technology, a lot of crypto projects have interesting real-life use cases. If you can use a bit of intelligence and insight, you can make very decent gains. 

There are a lot of naysayers, of course, but it’s really about how you position yourself. Can you be strategic, can you ride the cycles, are you able to pre-empt where the conversation and the consensus in the market is going? 

The beautiful thing about Crypto is, you don’t need to rely on the fundamentals too much, like you would in the stock market, because they are much less defined and much less time-tested. It’s a lot more fun because of this, but that’s exactly why it’s high risk. As one other commentator said, it operates more like a commodity. It’s similar to pricing for wine or art, in that it’s intrinsic value is given to it.

One thing I will say, it pays to be critical, you have to make up your own mind. If you can’t be a truly independent thinker, it will be much more difficult.

"My bet is that alt coins/vccoins wont perform as good as expected and only a few make (but make it big) out of a saturated market. The biggest gainers are going to be meme coins, once retail sets in. Because retail doesn't care about the complexity and utility. After those start pumping fomo sets in from those holding on to alt coins and will go into wild bull market for memes. You can already see it whenever bitcoin pumps. After there's probably a need for utility to cash out once it drops. After the drop you rotate to bitcoin and everything starts all over, prob with some new narrative and we'll have to wait for some years.

"yes, EVM is not unique to ethereum. Hence bitcoin L2's are adopting it as well to enable better interoperability with other EVM chains (including ETH itself). Other blockchain VMs exist as well but besides solana, none of them are getting anywhere near the traction of EVM.

"For explanation. ASI is a upcomming coin that contains three different coins that are going to sum up in one big coin.

There is Fetch Ai / FET (I prefer this), Ocean Protocol /OCEAN and Singularity Net /AGIX. 

All three of them doing great stuff and trying to solve interesting problems that may have a great future. Checking up on them, reading its future plans etc. is def worth it.

Attention: At this moment you have all three coins you can invest. The merge to the one and only ASI coin will be somewhere mid july or later. After that merge you will get different amount of ASI, what is depending on what coin you buying right before the merge. 
eg. FET will be traded 1:1 to ASI, AGIX will be 0,43:1 ASI.

Gas price futures markets is a very sophisticated genre that is under rapid development right now.

The market cap is incredibly low, like 5mill but effectively only about 1mill mcap because the Oiler foundation and Nethermind hold basically locked 75% of the supply.

All time high was 500mill so you have a clean 100x from here if the thesis works out.

As an investor you are fortunate that the holders got fully flushed during the bear market while the product was halted until recently Nethermind committed to seeing the development through.

"Algorand! I'm amazed it gets such little public attention 🤷 Currently has the highest tps (don't be fooled by Solana numbers - they include failed tnx in their numbers), highest RWAs, MiCA compliant, advisory to UK Parliament, never needed to fork, zero downtime ever, price is currently ridiculously low, quantum secure, only blockchain that has python as native prog language,instant finality etc, etc
When crypto has mass adoption, public and institutions will want reliability, usability, security and integrity... I feel like it's a no-brainier for mid to longer term investors
Have a look at Hesbapay and EURD - digital European currency run on algorand. Bank of Italy too. Even Lavazza coffee uses it!
Just my thoughts but I can't see how this won't blow up within 5 years. They've also made huge developments in India, Europe and South America. 
Bitcoin is obviously a solid store of value. Eth feels like it's beginning to crack and needs roll ups for future use so I'm concerned about longevity. Solana just doesn't work well - would have thought they'd iron out the glitches by now. Just doesn't seem reliable for day to day commerce long term. Plus it's reputation can be a little shady with the amount of dodgy meme coins.
For me algorand just makes perfect sense so I've got in as early as I can. It's also worth noting that Marc Vanleberghe is the CMO - he was responsible for marketing android.
It's still early days in crypto in regards to mass adoption but things have started to move fast this past year. I think algo has solid credentials and foundation to move into the next stage of crypto use.

"I can write a long answer about this and we can discuss in DMs if you’d like, but the top real world use case at this exact moment is the ‘hard money’ use case that Bitcoiners also claim BTC to be. 

It takes the two major strengths of Bitcoin, fair launched decentralization and extremely secure proof-of-work, then adds on top of it what Bitcoin does not have: extreme scalability. 

Now, the theory is that Bitcoin was novel in that it invented electronic ‘hard money’, and Ethereum was the next major milestone by making digital currency programmable. Kaspa intends to take both of those novel concepts and combine them. Many Kaspa fans like myself believe PoW to be inherently better than PoS, and so the prospect of combining the two major innovations within crypto is exciting. 

There’s no doubt that Kaspa is just in the early stages of this, and projects like Ethereum and Solana are currently implementing that second use case very well with a lot of projects on their networks. Kaspa is only two years old and so this use case is just now rolling out on KAS, so current investment in KAS is speculative on this part. That said, the market cap is very low compared to what it will be when it is running with various projects on it. 

Happy to discuss more if you want in DMs.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNSVc0U3ZhdGc0WXFaVXcybWpiS1drazQtLVA0bVpiT3lvUUg0NEtUSnJWa2xxalBkUDZnWFZtZllwSlJOMTlhNjlpalhJbnJnLWJIdGJYUjVnQUF2Z3pBRXJoMDBEWEFRbjhJdFhWLWZqUzg9

"As far as BTC and ETH go:

Bitcoin will always be the main store of value in the crypto market so that's always going to be a solid investment.

However, I've never felt as good about ETH because it just doesn't have the same kind of permanent value BTC does. ETH's main value is in it's ability to run dApps and it's been relatively slow and expensive compared to other dApp platforms for a long time. It really is only a matter of time before ETH gets dethroned by another dApp platform that just does the job better, but that can't happen to a store of value like BTC.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNMDBQLWZkY0xoMnBFbnZWUmwtVkhvVE01M0c2N1BvSUpjQmR5am1hUk81UHZDNGJjdExxeVBGTUgxd2VzNm1yaTNfai1Xd2tIcm96MFM3dVRmVEZUMkE9PQ==

"I'd love to have a normal conversation and argument about which policies of both candidates, but the fact remains that Trump is far from normal and really doesn't have any policies he is running on.

He is personally running on a platform of retribution and pardoning himself so he doesn't go to jail; both are horrendous. The people that are footing the bill for his campaign, however, are running on Project 2025 which will turn this country into Christian theocratic state with an dictator at top; also horrendous. And this is all before you mention all the multitudes of other horrible things Trump has done and promises to do. The last debate, he blamed every problem on immigrants, every single one. He lied and said immigrants are all rapists, murders, or mentally ill and are ""invading"" our country; abhorrently racist. Trump is also open to taking money from oil companies in exchange for legislation that will help them even more than they already are subsidized. The list of horrible ideas and problems goes on and on. Trump fundamentally doesn't care about anyone but himself. He will do and say whatever he needs to stay in power and out of jail.

Meanwhile, Biden and the Democrats are running on actual policies that will help regular Americans.

It allows large players like Base which spend millions of dollars in tx fees monthly submitting tx to eth mainnet to hedge their costs by speculating/locking in block space at lower prices.

Read why Jesse Pollack is so keen for this to be built.

It's a fundamental part of Ethereum infrastructure that hasn't been built yet. Block space derivatives, since fees fluctuate so much, there needs to be a way for the biggest Ethereum users to hedge. Think apps like Maker which spend millions in high cost eth environment or roll ups like Base, Arb, Gnosis, Starknet etc

"Its not a ponzi scheme. But I do agree with you about that it was supposed to be money. Not an investment. It was meant to be used and to provide its users with secure censorship resistant fungible money. Its failed at all those things! 

But it is not a ponzi scheme. By definition. The people at the top get paid by new people buying into the scheme. Bitcoin doesn't pay out a dividend. There's no people at the top getting dividends from new people money. To get money out of Bitcoin you have to sell your coins. That's not how ponzi schemes work. The moment new people buying in stops, a ponzi comes crashing down. If people stop buying bitcoin the price stops going up. It doesn't collapse! A crash in price is when more people are selling BTC then buying it. Its not a collapse of the network! 

People are buying crypto because they want to get rich quick! They have no understanding about the fundamental basics of what crypto is about!

"And the doubts are the same, every cycle.

We should expect the same thing in 2028.

The Halving doesn't trigger a bull run.  What triggers a bull run is the slow buildup of strain on the incoming supply of newly mined coins after the halving...  and that takes 4 to 6 months.

Why?

Picture the market for Bitcoin as if it's a giant lake. Buyers take water out of the lake and sellers dump water in. But there's also a river constantly flowing into the lake. In this analogy, the river is a steady flow of newly mined coins entering the market.

Dam up a river and the level of the lake it feeds into will eventually drop. But it takes a while for the effect to be noticed, because the effect of the dam is tiny at first but it builds up over time.

Once every four years, the Halving cuts the flow of that river of new coins in half, which means even if demand for Bitcoin stays flat, there won't be enough coins for sale to meet that same level of demand.

That's why, after the halving, it takes four to six months for the halved amount of new coins in the block reward to have an effect on the market.

Think about it.  When the halving happens, it only affects ONE PERSON: the miner who won half as many coins.  Ten minutes later, another miner wins only half as many coins as before the halving.  Ten minutes later, another miner...  ten minutes later, another...

It takes 4 to 6 months for that to add up to enough of a change on the entire supply to cause a shortage...  but eventually, there won't be enough new coins reaching the market to meet demand.  That causes a supply shock, which causes the price to go up.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOLUhVZVJoT1BwdVphYWVhYnRuZ2JSdDVzaklzX1pHU05BMEdNOWpSMVU2X1R3TEM3Q3dyVWFxUGl1cmxPa3NLcHViWFdHLVZSaDhfa2xNUThCNmthLTlEYmQwdWxMbTMtbHVpck52WFdWQWc9

"Trump isn't running on any policies, but he also wants to turn the US into a theocratic dictatorship. We can't debate what Trump's platform is, but he's also a really big fan of this policy book the Heritage Foundation put out. It's one thing to think a candidate is dangerous, it's another to hold two completely conflicting ideas about him in your head at the same time. Either Trump doesn't have any idea what he wants to do, or what he wants to do is terrifying and he have to do everything in our power to stop him - pick one.

  
I'm not interesting in debating the specifics of what Trump does or doesn't want to do, for two reasons. The first I've already outlined, Trump had a term already and proved himself to be an ineffective administrator who fought with his own party, the Democrats, and was routinely sabotaged by people inside his own administration. There's little reason to believe this will change with a second term, his policies are just window dressing for the idea that electing him will totally own the libs. It's his whole appeal, something about Trump so totally breaks progressives' brains that they react in a way that can be very funny to watch if you don't take the idea that Trump is warming up the ovens for LGBT folx seriously.

  
Do you remember when Trump wanted to appoint Herman Cain to the board of the Federal Reserve? If Trump can't even get that done, he can't turn the US into a theocracy. It is not easier to suspend the constitution, abolish congress, and install Paula White as Spiritual Guardian of America than it is to appoint someone to the board of the Fed. It simply isn't, this is fearmongering. 

  
The other reason I don't want to debate this is because Biden's recent debate performance pretty much sealed the idea that he isn't mentally fit to run for POTUS. He was obviously in a state of cognitive decline during the last election, but now it's so bad the Democrats continuing to run him comes off as elder abuse.  The thing is, the terrible things that Democrats were afraid were going to happen all happened under Biden's watch - Roe being overturned, loosening of gun laws, states' putting the Ten Commandments back in schools, etc. What are you really voting for at this point? If this is the guy steering American away from the Christian Right, he's asleep at the wheel.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOTUMzSmlpYi1lWmd2a193QmhXMjhfUlBhQTVkWGtxSW5ZVUUyTkdPTGJfd2ZZbjUxYUtfbmNhX3JKU2FvQWJibDhNT0ZweHJOekdWNGx2Y05BWUNRYlpMVVNSYnZTTXVoaWZBLUlwMjdCS3c9

"My response to these sorts of posts is to say just look back at what people were saying a few months ago.  Everyone was so certain it was hitting 100k as it went to 70k.  So much certainty.

But everyone was wrong.

It stalled.  It barely broke the ATH.  Few sold at the top.

And that's that.  Now it tumbles again.

And now we see a load more predictions which will all be wrong.  It's humbling to go back and read the sentiment from when this bull run was actually charging up.  Do the same for 2021 posts.

Nobody knows.

With hindsight you can see everyone is wrong, with the occasional stopped clock (even a stopped clock is right twice a day)

If betting on a line randomly going up and down isn't for you then don't play the game.

"Yes the community is made up of people who just DCA in regardless. 

It doesn't matter what the price is, they all put their $200 in, or whatever they realistically save from their wages, and buy some coins and availability determines price.

The real test comes when bitcoin has to support a community of retirees alongside the community of buyers.  This will be a big shift in market dynamics.

Everyone who bought $100s will want to sell $1000s each month.  This will mean much more bitcoin is available combined with fewer buyers as people stop working.  

Some buyers will be replaced but they will still be buying a few hundred from their salary, they can't buy 1000s of these retirees.

This is when the real price test comes.  Likely in 10-20 years?  I'm a 40 something who bought my first coins in my 30s and I'll be switching to sells when I retire in a decade (mostly with traditional pension investments - my bitcoin will had some luxury to my life - hopefully)

That’s when you dca on the way down. But when bitcoin goes up, they all go up. Good luck to you my friend.

"It's fine if you think that fundamentally I'm wrong, I have no problem with that.

"Incorrect.

Crypto is not just a bubble, it is very much growth.

You are talking as if the economy of America is the only driving force of crypto, it's not.

Crypto is all over the world, and remember, when the American economy is collapsing, some other economy is profiting. Who could that be? Developing countries like CHINA and Vietnam, countries in Africa, in South America, and many more countries worldwide.

Many, if not most of those countries are quite keen towards crypto and some are actually very friendly to crypto, such as El Salvador, which has already adopted Bitcoin as LEGAL TENDER. So it's not just America. America isn't everything, and Bitcoin exists without it.

These developing countries very much drive the growth of crypto, if not the majority of the growth.

The United States of America sure is a good liquidity provider though with the ETF approvals and all, the institutional & pension money has been flowing in.

"people who talk about economic ""equality"" are inherently wrong, you guys are radical to the left without even knowing it.

An economy with ""equality"" isn't a capitalist economy anymore, its a socialist one. A capitalist economy needs to be competitive, and if we impose policies to make everyone equal, like with equal wages and income, it isn't competitive.

Equality has proven to be disastrous, Soviet Union collapsed, China had to open up, Vietnam had to open up aswell, and so on.

Government policies promoting ""equality"" are a waste. Shame on those governments, who make such policies! Shame on them for promoting socialism.

If one coin can hit 1 million dollars in 10 years and you can buy 3 or 4 of them now then I'd say it can make you rich,r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPbkxwOWFZM1g3ek5ER2dUa1UxSzBXWjdjNWFkWUlCOXJndklva0wtaGZRY0tRdFVUU3dDNTZFWE9aY0Q3MU9La0EtZUN0dXhtcEdmeVRDZ2lFV0RjREE9PQ==

"I’m not talking about socialist policies, i’m talking about the fact that QE funded the government and the government themselves were the major buyers of assets, propping up the market the way it has since 2008. Which leads to a greater concentration of wealth. Which is way more like socialism. 

It literally caused greater inequality. It didn’t lead to more growth, or higher wages, or more full time jobs, it didn’t lead to more purchasing power. All it lead to was higher asset prices which fewer and fewer people can reasonably afford.

"You made probably more in trading than most of us here, but you shouldn't be too confident, cause this might be your demise in trading. Where psychology and how you think is the most important part.

Anyway the more you have, the more you can lose. Of course It's good to have so much money, If you want to play safe, but most of traders are probably sick gamblers especially at start, because we seek to get rich quick, but what we mostly get it's just higher dopamine, frustration and sometimes debts.

IMO day trading is more for street than experienced traders, because it's always so well advertised which is kind of psychology trick. It's trick because most of ppl look for switching their ordinary job and whatever they do in it for comfortable sitting in the chair and make few daily trades. They don't even think that THIS IS NOT ORDINARY JOB. They think that they should work by making trades daily, but the more trades you do in the day, the more you risk and mostly lose.

To sum up. I wouldn't advise you day trading, better stick in swing trading which work out for you already. It's better to do few trades in the week or even month, but smart than few trades daily thinking that you are smart. And If you are crypto trader like myself, stick to trade bitcoin only and learn technical analysis. Altcoins are much better for investing, never for trading(too risky and speculative).

"Yo, so look man, best advice I can give is diversify your 600k. You can legit learn to day-trade crypto, with a $100 account, and run it up to ten bands while you get your sea legs and develop your trading strategy. Just make small positions and focus on having a thesis, an entry and exit, and an invalidation point where your thesis is incorrect.

You can cover your down payment on a house with a decent note using maybe a third of what you have and then continue earning money from your job(s) to pay the mortgage which will likely be cheaper than renting and build your equity over time which is good for your credit and good for the opportunity cost of the remaining part of your stack. I’d take most of whatever you have leftover and break it up into 5-10yr investment plays that you really believe it. Obviously take profit on the way, but one of the oldest sayings in trading is “time in the market is always better than timing the market.”

Day trading is a sucker’s game. You’ll make outrageous wealth investing in the cornerstones of our future global infrastructure. But I still say you set aside $5k, and then try your hand at running up a $100 account. It takes practice, but if you are committed and you actually research as much as you can about day-trading, you will absolutely be successful. Just remember that day-trading is your fun money, real estate and investments are your wealth and your future.

When purchasing you can use that income you would be getting for the other units to help your increase your income when purchasing (this helps if you are doing a loan) there is also seller financing that helps in these high times with the housing market.

"> However, there are some other variables at play currently, which is also causing a momentary disruption to the price.

That will always be true for any fiat currency, any crypto currency, any asset used as a store of value, etc.

Also, the explanation I gave didn't mention hype, which drives the price much higher than the post-halving supply shock.  And I didn't mention things like how the collapse of FTX or the repayment of Mt Gox coins has an effect on the market.

The world is not a simple place, but too many simple people seek simple explanations and simple causes for what they mistakenly think are simple effects.

It's always important to zoom out and see the bigger picture.  Or, if you're a fan of The West Wing, as Jed Bartlett would say...  ""See the whole board.""

I was just explaining why it takes a period of months for the halving to have enough of an effect on the number of newly mined coins reaching the market to cause a post-halving bull run.

But here's the thing.  Understanding the big picture stuff - in this case, the delayed effect of the halving & what causes it - can give you a better understanding of the cycle as a whole, and it can serve as a guide for what to do in times of instability.  For example, if the Mt Gox coins were hitting the market in 2023, it would be an obvious reason to sell.  But they're hitting the market in the period between the halving and the supply shock, which means they're adding a bit of a delay to when the supply shock will probably kick in (since those Mt Gox coins, and the German coins and others) are adding to the supply during a time when the halving is decreasing it...  which means...  in my opinion...  buy buy buy and HOLD.

I'm all about the big picture.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNPaml5X09GRGt6blUyUi1ZUlgya1ZNMW9QZkdibzdLdWMtOThxODR2cHZ4REJYaEZjc3RNOGhzTVl3c3pZbFA4Rldid2k5QXkzc3p5bDNKVkJ4Q19YZ2Y4WkkzbnN4TElBRllId0YyU2FTazg9

"You probably know much more than me to be fair. I thought consolidation is where the prices bounces around vague but fairly close top and bottom price levels due to market indecisiveness e.g. people buy and selling fairly evenly before there's either a trend where most are buying (run) or selling (dip) which sends the price in that direction substantially. I think time has to be a bit of a factor... If nothing else, for whales to make more profit. 

Seems like prices have been gaining - losing - gaining - losing around 10-20% this year. This seems to reflect previous 4 year cycles so I'm thinking it's nothing major and prices will start to jump up into a more extended run for a year or so.

Germany, US and Mt. Gox potentially diluting the market might have an effect that will be interesting to see. Plus US Fed and elections. Who knows.

"Yes that the one. It’s solid for scalping. 

For regular trading I would recommend GMX. You can trade limit order to buy and sell BtC and ETH and USDC and other tokens. You can also swap trade and the main show is the perpetual futures contracts. 

Like you said you’re not into using leverage untill you get comfortable, GMX is the place to practice.  You can use like 0.5x leverage or 1x so that you are not ever at risk of liquidation. But like I said you can just stick to spot trading and use GMX to create your limit orders and such.

- Why does this project exist?
- Are there other projects that are trying to accomplish the same goal? Usually the answer is yes, and so how is this project different?
- Is the project decentralized?
- Is it fair launched or was there a premine and/or VC allocation?
- What kind of consensus model does it use? What are the pros and cons of the model?)
- Does the community size make sense for how long it has existed? (Do people care about this project?)
- If the project is successful in accomplishing its goals, where would it reasonably end up in market cap and how long until it accomplishes those goals?
- What does the historical price action look like for this project? (Did it have one major spike and then has been flat since? Perhaps there has been a slow but steady uptrend?

"Don’t trade at 100% leverage. Use the usual risk management and position sizing formulas to manage your exposure. And do your research. If you just go all in and roll the dice, sure it’s gambling. But if you pile all your fiat into anything without risk management or research it’s just as much gambling regardless of whether you are trading futures, actual coins or shares of AAPL.

On top of that futures are great for hedging and passive income. I hedged my entire cold wallet with perp shorts the other week. Basically shorted the same exact same amount of btc futures as I hold actual btc in my cold wallet. That means if BTC goes up $1 my shorts lose $1 in value, and if BTC goes down $1 my shorts go up $1. It’s always net zero, locking in a “worst case” price at which I can sell my coins. But I did not have to touch any of my actual coins for that.

The worst case scenario in this setup is that I might miss out on profits (if BTC price goes above what I sold my short futures at). Best case I sell the futures once I see the trend reversing, lock in the delta from the drop as profit and use it to buy move BTC for my cold wallet with it.

On top of that you can make some passive income this way. Granted that is peanuts compared to the price swing in the actual asset, but it’s still about $12/day per bitcoin at the moment.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQdHlQMmpBd2ZYZkcxbGpQV21US21uS0hRdE9TbExvVnlTU1E4RFZKR2gwTzBmUzJPTHBZSnZPTmpFY2Z0aXR4V2RRZ25zNS12OHJVVXg0N01lOEFjNnc9PQ==

the bots that siphon pennies, they predict market movements with safe bets inside of a box where high and low can be measured.

the 2nd bot (shadow) follows the penny bot and then predicts the larger corrections within safe bets, anything from 5 cents to $1.

the fees are calculated in to protect the bots from over purchasing within the box high/low, and they move in tandem to each other. 

whale bots then learn how the macro effects work and move $1k chunks every hour, doesn't sound like a lot, but after 24h, that's $24k.

"If it's anything like last time, Trump will devalue the dollar significantly and the price of all things will go up including crypto. Last time Trump devalued the dollar by over 25% in 4 years. 20% of all dollars ever printed and put into circulation were printed in 2020, remember all of The $1,200 checks and $50,000 PPP loans? 

A weaker dollar means inflation, the price of all things goes up, from food, shelter, stocks, gold, crypto, everything. The underlying value of goods does not change. However the dollar becomes worth less and less with inflation. 

Biden is actively strengthening the dollar, through long-term investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and manufacturing here in the US. As well, he's actively removing money from circulation, undoing the dilution that Trump caused. 

I would say that biden's policies are sustainable, and point us in the right direction. 
Trump's policies were not sustainable, and caused a lot of debt, turmoil, and inflation. Frankly, the way he speaks, his ideas, and his plans for this country are Un-American. Trump aims to change our country into a dictatorship, and plans to install loyalists into all levels of the government, much like he did the first time around installing loyalist judges into courts. This time around, he will not be held back by his own ignorance. At this point, he could change the Constitution, have his opponents murdered, put the USA into a police state to trample our civil rights. He can decide that we don't get another election. At this point he would be above the law, and is already likely to pardon himself for the crimes he committed last time.

Like, ok. So is he going to legitimize BTC as a recognized currency rather than taxing it at every sale? Is he planning to ask the treasury or any major financial institution to set up easier onboarding or offboarding crypto? Maybe pushing for mining subsidies in states that could use technological boosts, or have the power grid to support? 

Just say ONE REAL THING that you actually want to do to support the cryptocurrency community aside from ""oh we're willing to accept donations in crypto now""? And like, can you push to have the republicans to put that on a bill now?

"You seem really forgetful.

I'm not a fan of either, but Biden's policies have already spurred long-term economic activity (for better and for worse) for the common person, and ultimately push the country in a better direction (renewable energy, semiconductors, mining, etc.) by incentivizing new innovative businesses to get started (while still being able to cater to the wealthy).

Trump's policies actively helped the rich get richer and didn't push our country in a good direction for the long-term IMO (watching out for big oil, kneecapping any climate initiatives, tax cuts for the wealthy, etc.), which resulted in short-term happiness for the common person, but like a kid who plays on an iPad all day every day not realizing it's because the parents just want to be able to ignore them, it will crash and burn unless the people in charge are a little more proactive.

One microcosm example of how they may seem the same but are different is in how they are treating mining and manufacturing jobs: Both parties want them to be able to work, but only one party is trying to get them to shift to industries that have the future in mind, while the other one is trying to keep the (unsustainable) status quo.

The last thing I want is a party of yes-people who cater to the highest bidders at the expense of all of us, our labor, our livelihoods, and the future generations.

I use a Trezor hardware wallet with my windows PC 
 
I use Rabby chrome extension or MetaMask for obscure shit and connect them to “Hardware Device” both sides f those wallets use the same trezor. They are interchangeable. I prefer Rabby for the transaction simulator before signing a transaction. (If your new to crypto, Rabby makes it super easy to use ETH and ETH layer 2 chains) 

I then sign into GMX with Rabby and make a “one click trading” wallet in the interface. That will be the hot wallet that signs transactions backed by funds in my cold wallets on my trezor.  

Then I fund the one click wallet with some WETH to pay gas for fees when I trade. 


Now that it’s all set up the trading is super easy. Just setting my buy and sell limits and adjusting positions all from the GMX one click interface without needing to use the trezor each time to sign the transactions.

"You can use Binance.US no problem. Binance.US does not offer futures trading though so idk why the hell you would use it for spot. 
You cannot use the regular Binance if you only have a US id: It doesn’t matter that you can bypass the ip address block with a VPN. In order to trade with regular Binance now you have to pass mandatory KYC and upload an ID from pretty much any country besides the US, then you can trade on Binance. They don’t allow US ids for KYC. If you have dual citizenship and have an ID from another country you can use a VPN and upload that ID from another country and use Binance.
To recap: You cannot use Binance with a US id period. Binance.US only offers spot.
Binance is practically no longer usable in the US as the SEC and CFTC have cracked down on exchanges recently and forced them to implement mandatory KYC. When an exchange has mandatory KYC and isn’t registered/licensed with the SEC and CFTC for operation in the US, that means US ids are banned from KYC and anyone with only a US id cannot use that exchange period. ip address block negation with a VPN is no longer applicable since most exchanges have mandatory KYC to trade now and don’t allow US ids for KYC.
I recommend the following exchanges for US customers: BTCC, Blofin, BYDFi, and LBank.
BTCC, Blofin, and BYDFi are all licensed for legal operation in the US by the SEC and CFTC and they actually ALLOW US ids for KYC no problem.
LBank is usable in the US at the moment simply because they don’t have mandatory KYC yet.
I highly recommend BTCC: They have 500x leverage available for max degening, only 0.025% maker fees for limit orders, 0.045% taker fees for market orders. They have demo/paper trading: The best way to practice and learn futures trading with no risk. The downsides of BTCC are they have a $200 deposit minimum which is annoying and don’t offer isolated margin, only cross: mildly annoying. Isolated margin can be negated by using stop loss. I personally am insane and don’t like using either take profit or stop loss. I prefer to close my position manually when I am content with the profit.

"Honestly screw hardware wallets. If your device breaks in the future you may lose all your crypto. Also hardware wallets have limited storage space so you can’t have that much diversity in your portfolio: your diversity will be severely limited by the storage space on the hardware wallet.

I have a Ledger but never use it because: 1: The fees to buy/sell/send/receive are absurdly high. 2: I cannot have much diversity with the limited storage space. 3: If it breaks I’m screwed. 4: I cannot spend the funds on there since the bastards are taking years to send debit cards to the US and probably will never.
I cannot speak for Trezor but if they are like Ledger which they probably are, stay away.
Use Coinbase and pay the $30/month subscription for Coinbase One. Then you get $10,000/month free trading volume with no fees and a physical debit card, unlimited diversity, and don’t have to worry about a device breaking.

"Market and current price are and aren't the same. Their difference is almost like a spread in forex, but not exactly. For example on bybit if current price of the coin is like $12 and it moved there from $11.50, the market price is still $11.50 to that point that current price have been $12 for some time. So there's a delay between those prices. Example if current price spikes up from $11.50 to $20, the market price could still be at $11.50 and your take profit doesn't hit.

Gas is a fractional amount of ETH or whatever the utility token on the chain your using is being spent to pay the block validators to add your transaction to the blockchain. You can pay lower or even no fees if you want but it’s possible your transaction just sits in the “mem pool” and never gets confirmed.  Gas is you paying for the miners to include your transaction in the next block they find.  

Miners are gonna fill their blocks with the most high paying transactions, so during times of high transaction volume it becomes a bidding war for fees to get included as soon as possible. 

That’s why gas fees can get so pricy sometimes.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYklsdVNZYnlfQk5vTFh2UUo4T1lJby1hbzBXcnA3Qk9KTHptTFRXeHJpVXZYSkNWNnNLRDdYckhNWjRKdVFoMVo4SG9xcEFReVFaSGwyT1MzQUF0MVJXWkl2X3hhY0dndmdCLWVHT0ZCYnc9

"The technical levels are mostly just the “how” part of price movement. The “why” is mostly about institutional intent, which is driven by market sentiment and corporate balance sheets.

Why does a market consolidate and trade in a range? Well, some large companies own a bunch of inventory, and their entire business model is to buy that inventory at a discount and sell it at a premium. They sell until the buyers dry up, wait for them to come back in and drive the price up, then they sell more, and they repeat that until they have finished selling the inventory they intended to sell.

I had taken $5-10k profit on the way from $20/coin to $60/coin but I still now have $15k+ SOL with SOL being at like $150/coin. I wish I didn’t take profit.

second is upto the dApp.

"1/ The previous bull market occurred during one of the greatest speculative bubbles of our lifetimes, fueled by stimulus and low interest rates. See: NFT’s and half of the top 50 crypto currencies. Many of the ATH’s set during that time are completely arbitrary imo, and most tokens are unlikely to ever reach them again. 

2/ There are now over 20 thousand tokens, and an absurd 67 with over 1 billion in market cap. Every large cap that enters the market dilutes that speculative money even more, and there just isn’t the liquidity to support the majority of large cap tokens. 

3/ Look around- the global economy ain’t exactly on fire. There is only so much capital in the world and crypto is still at the speculative end of the investment tree. 

4/ Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the only two ‘sure bets’ in crypto imo. It’s really as simple at that- and they are exactly where the vast majority of capital should be going. There will be a lot of large cap tokens that aren’t around in 10 years from now, simply because they are designed purely as exit vehicles for VC’s and early investors to dump token allocations on retail (see almost every layer 2 and retaking protocol)- the incentive is for a chain to derive metrics (TVL and user count) in the first 12-24 months- beyond that many of these chains don’t have sustainable plans for growth for the longterm.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZW9IWlBUWm9pRTZ6OGpvYjNURTNkNjVvbHpHZ3ZrXzF3dnBzZDZiOFZhMFRNTHRDYy1SVFlQdWxsbjluaHNNVGd2Nl9ZdjMyUV9ScE5Yc3dWb3lIZGc9PQ==

BTC just doesn't have the risk reward anymore since 2018. Yes, if you bought lows, you are up of course, but if you bought at say the $18k peak in 2018 and held since then, you would have gotten a better return with less drawdowns in Apple.

Also note a big thing going into the BTC ETF was Grayscale GBTC selling their 6% or so of the BTC supply. After the 2021 run, GBTC went as low as a 50% discount (it historically traded at a premium).

BTC is highly sought after because of decentralization. And the finite supply of coins means that as the demand grows so will the price.

"Creating a crypto is easy. Selling crypto is easy. But there's a lot of steps in between, both for rug pullers and for responsible folk. 

You can create a new coin in 10 minutes using existing templates. But then you need to gift some of it to yourself, into your own wallet. Not an exchange, but *your* wallet. Then you need to convince 5 or 10 or a million people to buy this coin. If they don't, the price doesn't go up, right? And they can buy it from you, but if not, you need to get it listed on exchanges in order for them to buy any. So you have to convince Coinbase or Binance or Kraken or any other exchange that this is legit. But in order to get listed on their exchange, *they* will want a cut. Either a percentage or an upfront fee. So you send them a million shitcoins just to be able to sell your other billion shitcoins. Now you're in an open market, but no one knows who the hell you are or what the hell this coin is for. So you need to make up a story and build a website. You need to market and post on Reddit and build a fanbase.

Once you've done all that, you still need to get lucky. But if you do, people will buy and the price will go up. Then, and only then, can you dump on unsuspecting idiots who fell into your trap.

"Uhhh the right's whole argument is that millions of rapist prisoner murders are crossing the border daily to do horrible things and take our jobs, while babies are getting chopped up in the 9th month of pregnancy. Those are fear based horseshit, and the votes they gain serve to elect someone that is only going to lower taxes on the super rich and stack the federal courts with Christian judges that rule based on the Bible. They want to eliminate the separation of church and state and raise taxes for the working class while beating science down in schools.

"Stacking the courts with conservatives so abortion is being made illegal in many states is pretty bad. Generally Republicans increase wealth for the top 1%, and Trump was no different. Then again Democrats do too in a more sinister way (they seem to reinforce the rightward economic shift inbetween Republicans who yank it even further right). A big focus on racist policies like scaremongering over immigration, building a border wall etc conning the public that immigrants are to blame for hard times when it's really a system designed to serve the wealthy that's their problem. Trying to repeal Obamacare without having a plan to replace it was pretty psychotic to be honest, would have caused a lot of harm had he been more successful with it (and I say this as somebody who dislikes Obamacare as a policy, it's still a private health insurance giveaway). Lots of things really but IMHO Biden is a fucking psycopath with his policy of arming Israel's genocide of Gaza - however that's also a bipartisan policy. A huge lack of focus on green energy as the climate gets more extreme, again fairly bipartisan. US politics is fucked up with insane priorities rather than giving people healthcare and housing. Y'all should do yourselves a favour and vote Green, try and get money out of politics and escape a situation where you have 2 deranged geriatric liars as your main options.",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacmFZd2ZXMEduSGFZeWZHY2tYZUREdi1jYWV3TGxPbkJ3ajJhNENBWHlmSmlybWxNR1F0SkhHVUcxWUtvMlFhcjV6Snk0U0oyRm1CV2tESU9JOWt0aVE9PQ==

But while he was president? We know now that historically low interest rates caused massive out of control inflation that fucked up the housing market. For at least a decade. 


Remember the Floyd protests? He sent national troops to disappear innocent protestors that were miles away from any federal building and then lied about it.


He tear gassed protestors in front of a church so he could get a photo opp.


He allowed in more illegals than Obama, and then lied about it. 


He printed more money than anybody in history. 


And then after he lost the election, he tried to convince a violent mob to help him commit insurrection, which thank God was a failure. But they did manage to kill a cop.

"# Comparison of trump and biden deficits

The national debt has increased significantly during the presidencies of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Here’s a summary of the key points:

**Trump’s Deficits:**

* Total debt increased by $8.8 trillion during his full term in office (2017-2021)
* Major non-COVID drivers of higher public debt were his signature tax cuts (causing $1.9 trillion in additional borrowing) and bipartisan spending packages (adding $2.1 trillion)
* Debt held by the public grew by $6.0 trillion during his full term

**Biden’s Deficits:**

* Total debt increased by $6.9 trillion during his three years and five months in office (2021-present)
* Major non-COVID factors include 2022 and 2023 spending bills ($1.4 trillion), student debt relief ($620 billion), and legislation to support health care for veterans ($520 billion)
* Debt held by the public grew by $6.9 trillion during his three years and five months in office

**Comparison:**

* Trump’s deficits were about twice as large as Biden’s deficits, according to a new analysis
* The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) found that Trump’s tax law is set to expire at the end of 2025, and fully extending it would increase deficits by $4.6 trillion over the next decade
* High interest rates make the taxpayer burden of both existing and new debt higher than it was during the era of near-zero interest rates

**Key Takeaways:**

* Both presidents have contributed to the growth of the national debt, with Trump’s deficits being significantly larger
* The national debt has increased by over $15 trillion since 2017, with the majority of that growth occurring during Trump’s presidency
* The growing national debt poses significant challenges for the US economy and future generations",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMjhDQkZURzJWSW5GdWxxMHhVMTNDNDJXb1k2bDZrV2FCZDJOM2VOeUZYQ0F0aGpYeGQ2R2VxU05veDhHNXN0MG1XY0M0bkRGUUVXdkRQS0lFVkxXWlE9PQ==

"Focus on the hopeful bull market first. What you make or don't make in this market can effect what you choose to do with your money going forward.

Otherwise, max out your IRA each year. Next time around you'll still at least be able to pick up BTC and ETH inside an IRA. You can be avoiding a LOT of taxes that way, particularly so if capital gains taxes are increased in the future, which wouldn't surprise me at all. There's also crypto-based IRAs where you can trade a lot more than those two.

You can also max out your 401k contributions each year.

And if you don't mind the capital gains, you can always just put whatever money into a traditional brokerage account and hope for your 10-15% while you bide your time to put it in crypto again. And if you do make good money this time around, it would be wise to spread it around a little, anyway, instead of putting a single large amount on any one asset class. I'm not one to normally sing the praises of diversification, but it would be wise with crypto considering how many people got rekt last time around in FTX and Luna and Celsius. I'm sure we'll discover our next round of crooks next crash.

"No, more that an asset's volatility or lack thereof largely dictates how you should treat it--whether you should hold it forever or sell it the next day and anything in between.

Bitcoin loses about 75% of its value in every bear (down) market. So why continue to hold an asset if it's going to be that volatile? Something like that is better for trading--holding until you've made a profit and selling when you feel it's too inflated and there isn't much more to go up. Then let it tumble and if you still believe in the asset, buying it again when it's down.

If we move to the stock market, Warren Buffet has owned Coke for I don't know how many decades. It's one of those companies which sure won't make you rich overnight, but through the years it's been a consistent winner. One of those stocks you buy and forget you even own it and then maybe check it out again when you retire. It doesn't have much volatility.

It would be absolutely correct to say that you can pick any four-year period in bitcoin's history and it would be in profit. But buy BTC at $69k where it was at three years ago and hold until now and you'd be $5k yet. But sell at $69 and buy back at $16 and you'd sure be happy now. Granted, that's not to say anyone can time the market perfectly.

And I say focus on the bigger ticket cryptos if you have plans on holding for a long time as you seemed to suggest you would, because many if not most of those bottom-feeder tokens just won't be around at all for the next bull run five years from now.

If you're looking at monthly buys, look up ""dollar cost averaging"".",r/cryptomarkets,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnblZQQTZyLWV3TTF5VHkzd2xTd2tSbC1PbC1ZX1dVMVZWbUxrVC1wTTZvdVRJYUhYX1dDa0tWLXV0QllsdGdLMkd2SGkzUUczclZVNTR5NUt1T3ltR3c9PQ==

"These ain’t emotions buddy. The market was extremely oversold for only a week or so. Of course, that itself can be a catalyst for the bull run, however, it’s just been 3 months since the halving. Trump assassination attempt definitely played a pivotal role in this surge but i feel this surge would be short lived. But there are also those etf inflows. Once the etf inflow reduces bears will doom the territory for a short time.

Also, the technical analysis indicated a bottom hovering at 50k. Bitcoin could reach to a greater all time high than the current cycle if there is correction and consolidation at ~50k price mark.
