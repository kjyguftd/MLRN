">astroturf data as a form of protection

I don't hate this idea, but those who would use this data against others would likely have a easy time validating the authenticity because location correlation isn't difficult.

Think about it this way..  If you were to say, change the cell IDs to random values.. Well, it would be impossible for a device to be in California with one record, then appear on a cell site in New York just 2 minutes later.

So, for it to be any kind of effective, you'd need to map all cell IDs and then put some logic in there for reasonable travel time, without making obvious pattern of life changes.  It would be quite the undertaking.  Even shifting identification values wouldn't work because attribution is also easy to determine, so the data would just appear fake and the real copy would be obviously real.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbmcxeUVzU3pPRHI1ZjEzaVlsR0t2SWZpZUtkWXNEQmFuQzBodUF3VGJmZ0Z0YzJfeW5FdVJ0MnNPMTJwOS1IRjFsVkpwU0staDVBZHF6VncwLVJfSWc9PQ==

"I’ve always looked at it like this, what is the purpose of the test

One type of test is to find all the possible combinations of ways an application, environment or asset could be compromised. AV/EDR/XDR/Firewalls/security controls or otherwise mitigations can prevent you from finding every single possible hole

The other kind of test is, as an outside entity, with all controls in place, what do THEY see and how can they hack the environment. You need a more skilled approach for this scenario than the first

"If you build an environment and it grows organically, stuff like this happens very easily. You purchase a new tool, this can only integrate with X but is not compatible with Y and so on. It's not surprising that you struggle with this.

I have two suggestions:
- Document everything you can in a central place. If you have to put research and effort into an issue, you should document it. If something similar happens, you can go back.
- KISS (keep it stupid simple). You environment seems complex and maybe it makes sense to reevaluate some of the solutions / tools you use. Maybe you have the potential to get rid of some of them and reduced complexity results in less effort to track down issues and maybe even saves you lots of money longterm.

"But you've got to understand that is completely anecdotal. You have not met enough people in enough different places/situations/companies to have a reasonably large sample size. 


I have a 180 degree opposite anecdote. The most competent person I ever worked with had a cyber bachelor's degree, like 10 certs, and only had a few years professional experience. He was just insanely smart and devoured new information like starved lion. He'd ask me a ""noob"" question about something I was fairly experienced in, and then a few weeks later we'd talk about it again and he'd have knowledge like he'd been working with it his whole career. And it wasn't bullshit, he actually *could* just learn (and actually comprehend) a year's worth of information in a couple weeks. 


The real lesson is that someone competence in this field is very often totally uncorrelated from what it looks like on paper. Assuming that someone with certs and degrees sucks is just as silly as assuming that someone without certs and degrees has no idea what they're doing. It's all over the place, there's really no surefire way to tell without actually talking and working with someone.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeVFoVW5RQk11cUxjeU4xbklGZDlhVXVUYUxSc1BFTWpuVE9xcTlnSkhBRWwwMDZLY3VsLV9CU1dSTkZsVTdnYUVMdG5lN0FkdWdublI5UklTLXMxUmc9PQ==

"I’ll make the argument that it does most individuals no good because pretty much every credit card company and many banks offer free monitoring. There’s “free” (where your data is the product) services like Credit Karma and CreditSesame. Many folks have already gotten years of free monitoring from other breaches.

Getting another free credit monitoring service really does no good at that point since we’ve already got it. And they’re usually only good for a year, but your SSN can’t be changed outside of an extreme circumstance. A free year does no good 15 months later. 

Companies love it because they can just buy monitoring on retainer and pay dollars per customer and hope it works out to less than the cost of actually giving a shit about security between breaches.


Monitoring is good but free monitoring for a year is almost always going to be relatively useless. ",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeE5sTWxkZkFTdlktNk5fTmtFdW1Wc05KUzg3QjQyMEUyZkZnVDNNTk9lY213dlllUzVZUzF3ak1QcEt6cURTSFdJRzJnTkdCTEJmak5TVEVxd3Y0LUE9PQ==
"I think hefty fines — I’m talking high percentages of total revenue — are the only thing that will truly convince CEOs to make prevention a priority. 

With how many data breaches have happened in the last few years, I think there’s less of a concern about prevention. They happen with such frequency that consumers are left to just accept it as a part of life and take their own preventive actions like freezing their credit with all three credit bureaus. If everyone was hacked, no one was hacked, essentially. 

Putting on my conspiratorial hat, it’s almost like there was a deliberate effort among CEOs/CISOs to allow lax security practices so that the proverbial bandaid could be ripped off and consumers don’t have anywhere to turn because everyone was comprised in one way or another. It turns infosec into more of a reactive PR/damage control effort than a proactive prevention and deterrence effort. Is it better to spend $10 million once (random number) to do damage control, or spend $10 million annually to have a properly staffed cyber security department? (Again, conspiratorial — what’s more likely is that people don’t know what they’re doing and implement insecure architecture/code without realizing it, especially as more companies move to cloud service providers.)

This case in particular is especially insidious though… if hackers got a hold of call logs, locations, the contents of texts, etc., I think heads are going to roll. 

It also makes me wonder if iMessage messages were exposed. In theory, those are supposed to be encrypted at rest and in transit unlike SMS, so if service providers like AT&T had access to them, that’s a _major_ issue both with iMessage as a secure messaging platform and public trust with AT&T storing supposedly encrypted/secure messages.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeXdoeXQ4a1ZUako4dWpLV1J4YXhNTzJCbGVpd1RQY1h0SElNVVBJNXRieGNIekVlSEJvTTBXZm03NFJENFB0eXRlRVEzZU52dHIyX19VYlFLeG52RUE9PQ==

">the contents of texts

Are not stored in call detail records, AT&T stated the contents were not part of the breach.

>if iMessage messages were exposed.

Not the contents.  Probably not in the att records either since they are transferred with a data session rather than the SMS/MMS handler.

Location information is part of it as derived from the cell ID.  The location, sector, and antenna and other info can be used to determine a fairly accurate location, which are part of that ID.  Data sessions also have these cell IDs, so even if you didn't have a call or text whilst visiting your secretary for some lovemaking, your device's location can be fairly accurately approximated due to the passive data transmissions, which are logged in these records.

"Hello I am looking for some career advice. My goal is to be a cybersecurity analyst and I'm trying to find the best path forward to achieve that. I currently have a bachelor's degree in computer science and a masters degree in cybersecurity. I also have the security+ and CySA+ certificates. My current job experience is a short stint as a software engineer. 

I recently received a job offer from a fed agency for a systems analyst role multiple states away from where I live. The starting pay is 55k which will go to 66k at the one year mark, 78k at the two year mark and 93k at the three year mark. It also provides me with a secret clearance. 

The second option that I have is to keep applying to all remote positions that I can find. I have some interviews for contract help desk positions which are paying sub $20 an hour. 

The issue that I am having is if I move to the job offer I will barely be able to afford it at the start and most likely have to dip into savings. I will have to find an apartment, buy a car, and pay on 100k+ student loans on 55k salary. If I take the second option I will only have to worry about student loans. 

Any advice is appreciated.

"A lot of factors - the military puts people in charge that can lead but have little to no domain experience or expertise at all. 10 years as an E-6 doing sysadmin work on base is HUGELY different and less rigorous than in the commercial world.

I can do nothing about this.  This feeling that “we’re DoD so we’re special” is rampant and the prime reason why they dont get taken seriously most of the time in the real world.

The DoD contracting world is full of money games in which you can get stuck on a subset of contracts but doing a very simple job. I have two contracts in which I literally only run SAST cans weekly, write a report and email it to someone that doesnt read it. I have another contract thats balls to the wall, up and down appsec testing but its almost certainly going to end in three months.

Were it not for my non-DoD background, id be just like 4/5 people in this system that are borderline frauds. Its frustrating.

"Hi Everyone,

I'm currently in cybersecurity. Have been working in it for slightly more than 4 years while doing my masters degree from a top 10 cybersecurity school on the side. I've learned about this industry in multiple ways and have become slightly disillusioned. It seems that a lot of it is just boring -- and boring IT especially. Maybe it is just a function of being in my particular employer but I'm starting to doubt that I can do this for the next 35 years. To be blunt = I'm miserable. Investigate phishing email this, crunch a security alert this, consult on some tool that, do some adjustment of configurations, monitor your network, adjust the firewalls, push some paperwork, pass an audit. I feel that my brain is rotting.

I also would like to note that I can type code like a software engineer since I've been doing it since age 13. But ""computer science"" people who just type ""if-else"" and are programmers are over-saturating that field as well. Besides, just generic software development isn't as interesting nor as specialized.

Then there is the automation issue. We are seeing an increased reliance on automation of alerting tools and capabilities in this space -- and organizations have been moving more and more functionality to the cloud. \\[Yes, I understand that cloud isn't a silver bullet -- especially cloud spend with regards to having on-premise servers\\]. As things get more and more moved towards the cloud, then with the new introduction of automated software tools and now AI, it seems that more and more of the functionality will be taken away from end cybersecurity analysts & engineers.

Then added into that, in the private sector there is massive outsourcing of IT and security functionality. I see for example SOCs being near-shored in places like Costa Rica and security engineering colocated for companies in India. I also am currently in the public sector -- and it doesn't appeal to me (work culture, lack of advancement, etc).

So I'm trying to determine the next career steps -- and even flirted with the thought of quitting the security industry entirely for greener pastures. Wanted to ask you all if you have any ideas for potential next steps, both cybersecurity and non-cybersecurity related. I hope that whatever step I do next is mentally engaging -- I feel that my brain is rotting.

Thanks in advance!",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZMlRqOWhzV1lJSkItVUNwWEhaT0kxd3pQZXNzVlJhZURobDlrRmxJcXFUOThuNF8xRUlwODhqczlNNDZseUpoeXRVLTFZVWFUcWpOYlpIOU5xSFZUOFE9PQ==

"Learning and managing burn out sooner.

You don't actually wake up one day and realize you're burnt out. It's low and slow, a gradual process, like a parasitic daemon gradually eating up resources but never raising alarms. Burn out is actually a *slow* burn that occurs on a daily basis until you check your stove and realize there is no wood left, and you are in the dead of winter.

You have to keep stoking your fire. You have to make sure you keep playing. You have to be creative and lighthearted. You have to remember to breathe and make strong efforts to have fun, to be healthy.

Otherwise it's very easy to tip in favor of the opposite direction. Work is a wildfire. It's easy to be anxious, sleep deprived, even paranoid. It's easy to see the flaw in everything.

"If you are a beginner in cybersecurity, a good place to start is with the free (ISC)2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification. This entry-level certification will introduce you to important concepts and help you develop a solid foundation in cybersecurity. 

Once you have a basic understanding of cybersecurity principles, you can start building your skills with platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. These platforms offer a range of challenges and exercises that will allow you to practice your hacking and security skills. 

If you are interested in specializing in security operations center (SOC) work, [DefBox.io](http://DefBox.io) and BlueTeamLabs are good resources. These platforms provide realistic SOC simulations where you can learn how to respond to security incidents. 

There are also many helpful YouTube channels that can provide you with additional information and guidance. Some channels to consider include NetworkChuck, David Bombal, and Cyber Mentor. 

Finally, Google offers an introductory cybersecurity course that can be a good place to start if you are completely new to the field.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSjlUQ20zSFVGY3dCbzZMNmhxRjJsQnlpQU9kUmp6RVpMc1BReS1JTXM2TWZSSnU2aWpfTk1YUEI0MWZNb2FDTE9xdzJCaXNZNV8weWFFMmlnS01UUFE9PQ==

"Real-world organisations should have multiple overlapping controls.

This makes it hard to test any single control. It's OK to disable or compromise another control in order to allow a good test. Especially if it's targeted in a way that just lets the tester in, no other threat actors. No biggie.

Whitelisting an IP address is a very common example, but think of it another way: If an organisation gives a pentester a badge to go onsite and lets them access a rack in order to test some device in the rack, even though the tester isn't a member of their wintel engineering team, the organisation has just compromised their physical access controls, right? If it was a truly black-box test they wouldn't have got past the reception desk or the boundary fence.

This is super common in pentesting. It's ubiquitous. Every week I issue credentials to a tester, or a cert or a key, or send them the secret URL, or whitelist some IPs, maybe share our confidential architecture diagrams or a db schema - all this helps allow a more effective test of controls. The platonic ideal of a ""black box"" test is for teenagers on reddit.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZN3RFRzNoMGRJdjNiQUgxN2ZKeGRoLWRVVnFSazZLSFRqQ0JxOTlpTTAtNXhpZlRpMHlJYnZVQkZud2Ntd3VvUkpEQWdhUE81OW1kUEpLaDRkbEw3bW9IdFB1dVo3NmtNNnAzZ3NEUzYzLW89

"/u/the_90s_were_better I'm genuinely interested in your perspective on this.

>Whitelisting apps is fruitless. 

Whitelisting is difficult, maybe not worth the ROI in every situation, and isn't your only option. Audit mode alone can provide valuable context and data points for investigations and hunts. Deny lists can also be helpful without having to manage allow lists.


>It’s more effective to block them with next gen firewalls.

Even if NGFW had complete feature parity, it wouldn't negate the possibility of ever benefiting from enabling another layered defense. 

>It doesn’t matter if the app can launch and not connect to anything.

You're assuming the NGFW is infallible and perfectly configured. Also there are many common architectures where an invected endpoint can spread laterally and vertically without traversing or being inspected by the NGFW. Two endpoints on the same layer 2 network segment can't communicate without being inspected by the NGFW?

>This can also be done with SCCM. 

So? Use SCCM then, as long as you're doing some application control you can benefit. 

>No need to use yet another app to control all the other apps.

More of a feature, not an additional app. It's not like it requires the overhead of an additional single use agent on every client. 

>You’re simply one vuln away from bypassing app locker and being right back where you started. 

This is the single worst argument in my opinion, I'm confused why this would ever get brought up. Does AppLocker have a track record of being vulnerable to bypass compared to any other endpoint security measure? The argument doesn't hold up: $EDR can be disabled by an attacker, so never use one? $NGFW had an exploited 0-day one time in its history, so never deploy it? 

""You’re simply one vuln away from bypassing $FW and being right back where you started.""


>It’s much more effective to control endpoints using transient devices rather than the endpoint itself.

Defense in depth is your best chance of success. Something being more effective doesn't negate doing anything else. Perfect can be the enemy of good, yada yada. 

>You’ll learn in due time.

I'm confused why you'd choose to sound snarky. Does your argument hold water, or not? I get that managing process allow list can be a bottom less pit, but I'm genuinely curious what in your experience has convinced you that a NGFW is the only answer in this scenario.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZQ1lKa0MwbzZxNXloRmZROVJYekkwVHliTGVqWS1BUlBoZjd2d2ttczIxSF9BU3VHVjhCYUd5WGdkVTdzTGhpTHQ2cDViRHFKS084bFhhZG02dDJJMXc9PQ==

Then they might recommend to you the need to let them perform actual PenTesting on the application or web service itself (which at this time whitelisting the specific user IP address with associated MAC address of device can be done to allow for the pen-tester workflow).

"This is a very good question. I don't know the 100% solution to this, but in a server environment, when we know *exactly* what a server is supposed to do, we usually have DTrace scripts running that watches which process have been executed, who executed them, who forked them, which files they opened, etc.

The data then is fed into a logging system that monitors these actions and alerts as needed. This would be hard (but not impossible) to implement for a desktop environment, but very easy for a server environment if you know exactly what the server is supposed to do.

Luckily, DTrace now is part of Windows and we don't need to install it manually anymore ;)",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZZFljRGxReFd4bVNsVklHTjRoTEtzdEZxTzRIdDFJTWJXNlR3OXVEcTBKNDV6NWxtLXJyQXVvR0ZUd2RObTJJbFpvQVo2QWR4cWFhbEpFSzJxZ3Bqd0E9PQ==

"Some useful information you might get from the IP would be:

* geolocation: knowing where the device with the IP address is located can be useful to determine further action. An NA or EU IP address can lead to follow up action by law enforcement while an RU or CN IP might be blocked outright if there is not business case to be accessing resources in such countries.
* ASN: the Autonomous System Number can give you a general idea of what the IP is for. It can say whether it belongs to an ISP's client range, a cloud service provider or an organization with it's own ASN (this last case is extremely unlikely to show up on a malicious domain search)
* passive DNS: you might discover other domains resolving to that IP address.

"Potentially, but hard to answer so broadly, peculiar routes could just mean it’s a certain type of network to meet a specific requirement and not mean you’re in a DMZ. Peculiar routes could be internal subnets go to one IP and the default gateway of the host is a different IP. But again, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in a DMZ.

A DMZ is generally setup in the same way as any other network. External firewall/internal firewall and your servers sat in between. The only way to determine if you’re in a DMZ would be further exploration/enumeration of the network and neighbours from the host you have access to. You may get lucky and the hostname may have dmz in it. 

It also depends on the purpose of the network you’ve infiltrated. If you hacked into a network we look after, you’d find every server in the dmz has an external NIC with a unique public IP assigned to it. That would be a tell for me, but someone who hacked in may think something else. The question, in my opinion, is a case-by-case base, and being in the service provider world, I can tell you after seeing 1000’s of customer networks that they are rarely setup the same way, or even make sense. 

Only go off what you can find as fact, and one clue will lead to another.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUi1QbmFtUnlubGJqTHdKUDJDdzdpX19kdUlKZkdJTGctek9mcUFLUy1ZR2xLdTZmbzhIWDVrYWdQRmpYUWVPeUpmdUwwM0w4MzhaOUJvOW9fTFJGQmc9PQ==

"Which Undergrad certificate should I get? Plz help


I am going back to school after a break but now I’m having trouble deciding between an undergraduate cyber threat hunting certificate or an undergrad computer networking certificate. My goal is to just be on path to get a job that will make me hopefully $100k+… most likely as I spend more time in the career. I just want to be in a career that will give me the financial stability for the long run.

Does anybody have any insights on which would make the most money and have a lot of job openings? As well as what jobs exactly that I could get. The university (UMGC) that I will be attending said that they offer support in finding jobs after completing a certificate because I’m a military spouse but I’m not sure how helpful they’ll really be. I also have no prior experience with anything computer related but I do have an associate’s in general studies, which is pretty useless to me at the moment lol

There are also some other certificates that they offer like cloud computing & networking, data analytics, digital design, and web design, but I don’t think they would make as much as my top 2 choices. I’m not too sure tho!

"1 - This is all about managing relationshipssoft skills and seeing and you work in teams and overcoming problems. I'd say I'd sit down with the other individual and go through how we got to each of our conclusions and try to understand each other's point of view. Give an example about how drawing a 6 on the floor looks like a 6 to me but a 9 to someone standing opposite me. We are both right yet appear wrong to each other.

2 - To this there is no right or wrong answer here. Anyone who says data in transit or data at rest without more information or an understanding of 'the risk' doesn't understand this question.

You need to link this to risk and the interviewer is trying to see if you have this understanding. You need to understand what's your bigger risk and address that. Give a very high level example of data being stored in a physical location (say a room) and you have physical control of that location (say a secure room). Storing this unencrypted could be seen as less of a risk than unencrypted data that traverses the open Internet. In this case I would prioritise protecting data in transit as this is where my biggest risk sits. 
The opposite example would be a situation where data only transits a network within a physical controlled office and is then stored on hard drives. These hard drives are taken off site and stored by a third party. This would be an example where I would prioritise protecting stored data because I see this as my bigger risk. Yes there's far more information you need in a real situation but this what the interviewer is after. Link to risk...

3 - I'd say humans but we must also caveat this humans are also our biggest strength. Good organisations are starting to try and change the negative attitude of humans being the weak link, which we can be to humans being a strength or even a saviour at times. We've all heard cases where a potentially catastrophic incident was averted because an admin or user noticed something was up and felt confident and empowered to report it yet all we like to bang on about is users making mistakes.

"The first one I would preface by saying I'm humble enough to very rarely be 100% certain about any hypothesis. Id' talk it through with the other party and possibly engage others to see if we could resolve the points we disagree on. Assuming we are talking about a security matter, I would expect it to progress through the organisation's risk assessment process and the risk owner would have the ultimate say. My responsibility is to support the risk owner in making an informed decision and my ego doesn't come into it.

Second one, the criticality/sensitivity of the data matters more than it's state. That being equal though, probably data at rest because of the volume. Data at rest potentially encompasses the entirety of our data whereas data in transit is only a subset.

Third one, humans are the weakest link. However, it is dangerous to focus too much on securing one area/element as that means you will neglect others and attackers will exploit your weaknesses where they find them. Better to adopt an effective defense in depth strategy, coupled with zero trust to mitigate the human risk as much as possible.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQnJrTnFNR1FXM3VCUDVJd05uXzRDVkc3MDRyX29neWs1by1YUDFDZEJyMVhmVzFHRkp2ZGNXbV9CUllObHBhdlNhd1JRc0FJbmdKeC1hM3Z1R05Cdm96MnR5U2ZLM0V4SmQtSk4zaTg5RmM9

"I got a job straight out of university, 10+ years ago. I’m in the UK, and think the job market is a bit different here compared to the US.

Hack The Box, Try Hack Me and Portswigger Academy are good places to learn the practical skills. In general, you need to have a decent understanding of the fundamentals of networking and general application stuff (such as the various languages, how a web server works, what a database is, etc.), plus some understanding of how to go about hacking those things.

In terms of certs, I think OSCP is well regarded in terms of technical abilities; but I’m not sure if just having that and no experience is enough in the US.

For somebody getting into the field, I’d make sure you’re good on the technical stuff; but also be able to communicate well in writing and verbally. A large part of a pen test is conveying what you did and found to the key stakeholders, so being able to produce written technical documentation, and articulate your points well in meetings is an invaluable skill to have.
On that point, make sure the spelling and grammar on your CV/Resume is flawless, and that it’s presented well. It should also sell your knowledge and experience in IT and Cyber.
Id also suggest that you practice interviewing if you can. My university’s careers team offered mock interviews with really helpful feedback, which was good for getting a feel for interviews. I think by about the 3rd or 4th real interview, I was then able to present myself well enough to get the job.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabFh1VkZMTzVRRmQ4S0tXUTFQUXg0SUVrOTVETjNEWnBpTjN6UzhVSF9tR0pvT25fWGs1dlpmcWptaG00ZDZoWHBtbXVVSzFSNDdMd2JlRXBBcENOOFFsd0ZNanJnaG9nRHh5N0tfeFB3d0U9

"Hi Everyone,

I'm currently in cybersecurity. Have been working in it for slightly more than 4 years while doing my masters degree from a top 10 cybersecurity school on the side. I've learned about this industry in multiple ways and have become slightly disillusioned. It seems that a lot of it is just boring -- and boring IT especially. Maybe it is just a function of being in my particular employer but I'm starting to doubt that I can do this for the next 35 years. To be blunt = I'm miserable. Investigate phishing email this, crunch a security alert this, consult on some tool that, do some adjustment of configurations, monitor your network, adjust the firewalls, push some paperwork, pass an audit. I feel that my brain is rotting.

I also would like to note that I can type code like a software engineer since I've been doing it since age 13. But ""computer science"" people who just type ""if-else"" and are programmers are over-saturating that field as well. Besides, just generic software development isn't as interesting nor as specialized.

Then there is the automation issue. We are seeing an increased reliance on automation of alerting tools and capabilities in this space -- and organizations have been moving more and more functionality to the cloud. \\[Yes, I understand that cloud isn't a silver bullet -- especially cloud spend with regards to having on-premise servers\\]. As things get more and more moved towards the cloud, then with the new introduction of automated software tools and now AI, it seems that more and more of the functionality will be taken away from end cybersecurity analysts & engineers.

Then added into that, in the private sector there is massive outsourcing of IT and security functionality. I see for example SOCs being near-shored in places like Costa Rica and security engineering colocated for companies in India. I also am currently in the public sector -- and it doesn't appeal to me (work culture, lack of advancement, etc).

So I'm trying to determine the next career steps -- and even flirted with the thought of quitting the security industry entirely for greener pastures. Wanted to ask you all if you have any ideas for potential next steps, both cybersecurity and non-cybersecurity related. I hope that whatever step I do next is mentally engaging -- I feel that my brain is rotting.

Thanks in advance!",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaU29nWVhhd0hnSUR4cjhmY20wX1VlVGxQUDB3Q2MxUG95S3Q5WGxWeHhTZHUzam9vOGZaZWpyOGVyd2hQem0xYlNSajdfWFBFUlB3Z0FyWWxQNkRJQ0E9PQ==

"Ciso : chief information security officer. Head of information security, may have physical security responsibility as well.

BISO: business information security officer.  Newish title doing the round, halfway step between the business and cybersecurity.  If your CISO is a good communicator or the cybersec team has good comms or BAs on staff they should not be needed. Who they report to, unsure, never met one.

CIO: head of IT. Infrastructure, cloud, networks, coders, helpdesk, business systems and ERP etc. Often has cybersecurity lumped in with them but that should not happen as CIO and CISO objectives conflict. CIO often report to CFO COO or CEO depending on organisation, size, market, and needs.

"I am gonna throw some gasoline on this discussion

I don't think humans are the weakest part of security - seems almost like a cop out answer to me 

I'd say the biggest problem in security comes down to how do you manage change to your security model once the original team that builds the environment is gone.

How do you extend your iam roles in the cloud for say a bank 

How do you know if a firewall rule, or an org policy will impact something down stream by increasing the number of attack vectors. 

How do you continue to get funding for your secure team (not toys) when your cjo and board are enamored by a cloud provider or product company's sales team.

"Regarding USB Flash drives there are NO exceptions in SC/TS environments, and very few for other removable media. Even down to CUI, flash drives are not permitted. Some allow removable media but They have to meet very stringent requirements and all systems (Endpoints)  have that port disabled by default. 

Agree with you regarding capabilities of most companies. Most companies have AV and nothing else. Most don’t have EDR capabilities at all. And most don’t have vulnerability scanning or any other basic cyber capabilities. 

If we come back to best practices though, no one should be carrying around USB Flash Drives plugging them in all Willy nilly all over the network and running programs or executables from them. It’s a really bad practice. 

At the bare minimum (good) disable those ports by default, and scan any removable media that is coming on your network and make manual exceptions or create AV policies that scan any removable media as soon as it’s plugged in. If your company has more resources , implement the solutions like the ones you mentioned before with InTune and MDE (better).

"You are not wrong, but neither is your boss.

You can certainly integrate everything into your centralized SSO environment - there are benefits to doing so, such as having a single policy enforcement point.

The critical step is to ensure that administrative accounts and administrative systems are configured to NOT have an SSO experience. Admins and those with access to admin apps should encounter MFA at every authentication instead of have transparent SSO occurring.

"I finished mine not too long ago with my degree as a cum laude student and have my security +. So far I personally think you should start applying already even if you don’t feel confident that you qualify. The competition is horrible rn and the reality is that it’s going to take some time to get into the field. You may have to start as IT help desk and work your way up. I’m even considering to join the Navy to jump start my career since the military look for those skills at the moment, and will train you. Network as early as you can and do internships even if they’re volunteering. 

At the moment, experience from work matters over certs from what I’m seeing. Most applications would state that security + is desired or a plus in entry level jobs. Education will only get you so far, and it’s the experience that completes it. It’s crazy as there are not many willing to train incoming graduates for entry level. Just food for thought, an entry level help desk will ask 2-3 years from a previous Help desk role! Like wtf

Don’t let it get to you because you can do it just like others have shared their own stories. If you really want it and work hard for it you can make it happen. Getting the first job is the hardest part if you don’t have people to get you in. Maintain your knowledge, apply everyday, work on projects like on hack the box, do home labs, get out there and network, prepare to do jobs you may not want, keep up with technology, and never lose sight on your goals. It’s all possible but it’s not as easy as it would have been 3 years ago with COVID. Just hope you realize it and start seeing if there are plenty of jobs in your area or if you have to move. A lot of things to consider and I really hope for the best for you!",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnRi11cU5Ec2NoOWNHOWlVMHNObVVJaHNXWk5oYjJsaFVTT3phdmc2aWR4VnltUzFNajRsSU5XdzlaakJVdlBCbG13OGZseUVpVXUyVGQtSF9zVG5seVE9PQ==

"I don't think your expectations are necessarily aligned with reality. ""Working with a CISSP"" - when you phrase it like that, it sounds like you're asking what it's like to play football with Messi and Ronaldo. It's not.

  
The CISSP is a certification which a person who has 4 years of experience in cybersecurity can get by studying. It's an exam. 22 chapters, 1000+ pages, and a large number of those chapters have nothing to do with tooling, vulnerability management or in-depth knowledge in those areas. It even says in the beginning of the book it's ""mile-wide and inch deep"".   


The person's experience always comes first - if you were talking to a cybersecurity pro with 10 years of experience, but who never worked in a Soc/SecEng/Technical position and has worked in GRC, or security awareness, or a bunch of other stuff, would you expect him to know how to interpret alerts and grasp the finer points?

"SSO is trusting an external 3rd party to do your authentication for you - it's handing over the ""keys to the kingdom"" and hoping they do a better job at it than you.  Sometimes it's hard for an org to accept this, other times it's seen as an upsell where they can charge more for basic SSO. 

I like SSO - it reduces password/MFA fatigue, it allows for additional conditional access and other great security tools so it should be welcomed. 

We have both in our apps - local auth and SSO/MFA but once a user authenticates with SSO then we lock them to it and disable their local auth.

"We use Aglide. You connected it to Okta via SAML & SCIM then mark which users/groups have what app (e.g., Marketing has Figma). 

When users sign in to Okta, it flips the accounts to Aglide SSO apps by changing their email address password and 2FA. 

Apps are then in the Okta launcher. End users can just access them the same way as they would a SAML app. 

Not sure exactly how it works, I inspected the network traffic and it wasn't just autofilling the browser. 

It all basically hinges on the idea that end-users can't access original account credentials, so they can only access it through SSO - that's why you can do stuff like conditional access",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWU5QN08tWEIxMmEydjBhT1NpMmVTQkF1eDB1MEdvTl9NWjBSQXA5UXdKRnFSYkxhRXFiVmdCNkFKTFpVSU5uWG9nOER3SlRHNFQ0WEhJQVhqb2dXcTlib1JQRmk2Z01xTHZRSzhkSTAxUm89

"Be aware that cybersecurity is not an entry level field, we could even challenge if there is a ""simple level cybersecurity"" at all.

Cybersecurity intersects all areas of an operation, it's a chain that is not stronger than its weakest link. Hackers will hit you from all sides at the same time - nobody can be an expert in everything, but you need to know they exist and why. Governance, risk and compliance (GRC) is cybersecurity even if it's not technical. Software development security is cybersecurity. Identity and access management is cybersecurity. Network security is cybersecurity. Endpoint protection is cybersecurity. And more, and more.

"Having a CISSP neither guarantees nor precludes ability working in security. Many security professionals have it, but many don't advertise it. It's a thing you get primarily as evidence for people outside security - evidence that you can get it and that you've had the motivation to do so.  Actual skill in security is generally developed through experience and self directed study or experimentation.

Try not to focus on it too much - get it if it's something you need and ignore it if you don't. Conversations about it's value are mostly a distraction.",r/cybersecurity,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncERuR0dNZkJLU1RYQ0V0OWZyeVZ1ZkdBX1pjdkdKOVk2Y0FTMHJ6YWE4YXJMYXdsSXEzSHQ1YXRGZi0tdks5Zk5sZnZhTjRHWnF1UVczRkh2UFd2OXc9PQ==
