"I think it depends on what level you are. I think there are much more valuable skills than learning how to implement everything from scratch. Also you are not expected to build extremely advanced solutions until later in your career. You are required to have a solid understanding of the basics as a junior.

Things that I consider more valuable are knowing how and when to use each algorithm, knowing plenty techniques for feature engineering, always seeking business knowledge, knowing how implement and deploy models to production, like cloud/databricks and all that, and being a person that is always keeping up with new advancements. For me these are much more valuable and will take you further and faster to a higher position. 

After having more knowledge and experience, knowing the ins and outs of algos becomes more valuable as well, and you'll have the maturity and skills to decide when to go for something more sophisticated or customized or not.

There was a similar discussion to this a while back, between A) spending years studying then seeking professional experience or B) going to the job market asap and learning while doing.

"Need to talk to the analyst team manager to set expectations around roles and responsibilities. If it’s your role to pull data for every analyst request then you need to formulate an intake process and even hire more people. 
Have seen this sort of dependence at one of the places where the analyst team was basically lazy and getting away with it because their director was powerful and a bully.

It's just not neccesry 99% of the time. The reason people learn algorithms in detail during education is so that they're comfortable understanding implementations later in their career. You do need to understand what various algorithms do and how they work. More than likely, you'll never need to write them from scratch.

If any professor is saying that, generally, you will need to do this in industry or you will be expected to demonstrate an ability to do this in interviews, then that professor does not know what they're talking about.

"In  my opinion , Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. The process begins with formulating two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0), which represents no effect or status quo, and the alternative hypothesis (H1), which indicates the presence of an effect or difference.

The testing involves collecting data and calculating a test statistic, which is then compared against a critical value to determine the p-value. If the p-value is less than the significance level (typically 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. Hypothesis testing is crucial in research and data analysis for making informed decisions based on empirical data.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTT29qMnB3NTN6N0VSQ1Z2cUltS3M2M0VkbklVM3NnMkZWd3o2c2s5MGFXVGlEX0FJcGtZS3ZXWGR4VmJEUFZkZkhMcjhsOExFQlA2dldiaU5iaFhkYUE9PQ==

"no, please stop trying to solve my ""problem"" -- the question is a math question. I'm literally asking you where the math is to impose a curve on a skewed distribution and then find the point at which there is X area underneath that curve.   


I am trying to say this different ways to clarify, but it's only getting murkier. I'm literally just asking for the mathematical functions I couldn't find googling for ""imposing curves on skewed, bimodal, and non-normal distributions.""

"> where the math is to impose a curve on a skewed distribution

No, this is almost certainly an [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378). ""Imposing a curve"" on a skewed distribution is not what you want to do. You might want to model a skewed variable, but even then that is not a mathematics question as much as it is one of domain knowledge (the ""math"" there would be enough of a background in statistics in order to develop a reasonable model). It's hard to know exactly what you want to do without more information, but curve fitting non-normal variables is almost certainly not a path towards developing a reasonable simulation.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZVlTS0dBaWpsWkNZR3hleXZ5THp6QW1scUwwcDFpdjZ6LTdubDl4VEQ3VnB2UDNFcEtESHhiVmdRMEV3dmZBblNLUmI5ZkV0a0hZNWh0clEwcEE4QXc9PQ==

"Agree with u/dfphd on the standard for ICs being higher than for managers. In terms of how to be twice as effective, the typical model is someone who is a specialist, often through a PHD.

But, another model that I've found effective and perhaps more achievable, is when a teammate is good, if not the best, at two things. In my work, that's been someone who was an excellent applied scientist as well as excellent ML engineer. She was able to understand the latest models and also understand how to scale them to deliver results reliably. Even though she was an IC, she had an outsized influence on the team by creating standards and best practices that she persuaded everyone to follow.

"I've done some work in sales in the past. It's very different from marketing. 

The key KPI was production to a goal, sliced different ways depending on what we were looking at. 

There's a lot of data science-type work that can be done depending on the sort of sales you're working with. Goal setting requires some data science, and it can be used for deployment too. Propensity to book, scoring leads in some way, identifying priority accounts/leads, and streamlining the sales process are all helpful. 

Sales people can be challenging when it comes to data. Some are great, but others don't like the data interfering with their process, or just don't understand it. I'm over-generalizing sales people, but a lot of them went into sales because they liked working with people more than they liked working with ""stuff,"" and they tend to not be super patient about learning, so they can be challenging stakeholders. 

They're a lot of fun at conferences though.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN3Joc0pRTW95U2RqeG5aamNYMlpnUlYtd0hSSXozdmhiVmNRUjFMSFpWN0pfaWczVkYyZjlwc19TRGxoYVUyZndrM3BqbjZFWDNyZjRCNzFjUThRVUl6eUNXek4za28zTmdtRHFuZ2laY0U9

"Honestly does anyone else just feel kind of hopeless about the job market? I graduated in May 2023 with a MS in Statistics and have a BS in Math. I just passed the one year anniversary of my graduation and am at about 1,400 job applications, and it really feels essentially impossible just to even get noticed.

  
From those applications, I've only gotten a handful of initial recruiter calls or preliminary coding tests, and only been through the interview process for Data Scientist roles at two companies. Each of which are extremely well-known and well-respected companies, and I made it through 5+ rounds of interviews at each company. I got exceptional feedback, saying that I was a perfect cultural fit at each and did great in the interviews, as well as had interviewers tell me how impressive my personal projects were. One of those companies even flew me across the country to their headquarters for the final interview to meet the team. Ultimately though I was told I was the second choice for the role at each company.

  
I feel like I've taken all the general advice and done everything that you're supposed to. I've done personal projects to make up for being a fresh grad, I've networked, I've fine-tuned my resume to satisfy ATS bots, etc. I've had multiple high-level DS managers that I know through networking or being hiring managers I interviewed with tell me my resume looks great and that I would have no trouble getting a job in data science if it weren't for the current job market.

  
I also apply to essentially any job quasi related to DS or Statistics; Data scientist, data analyst, BI analyst, statistician, decision scientist, any kind of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ analyst, etc. I'm also in the US and have no visa-based restrictions. Meanwhile I seem to see people all the time from non-stem backgrounds doing online data science ""boot camps"" and getting jobs right away.



I guess this is more of a way to vent than anything, but damn, is anyone else in a similar situation? Has anyone gone through this and finally gotten a job at the end?

"Getting back into the field after a couple years off doing personal projects, traveling, and 10 months total of contracting work.

I have a B.S. and M.S. in engineering fields (the M.S is operations research). My last two roles were Senior Data Scientist, including the contract role. 

I've worked on everything from visualization to machine learning modeling and deployment on GCP, with airflow and databricks as well for pipelining, data warehousing, etc. Nothing cutting edge, but you know, what I consider to be a solid skillset for anything not PhD-level research based. In total 8 YOE.

I've been applying for about 2 weeks now, which I know is not a lot, but I want to maximize my chances. I've reached out to connects, posted on Linkedin (for the first time ever), and am applying to any jobs that fit my skillset, since I know the market is insane right now.

What worries me are the gaps- I haven't been employed in the last 7 months. While I've done a lot of productive things in that time, none are related to data science or engineering.

While I'll keep applying, my other ideas were
1. Take some courses to update my skillset (iffy about this one)
2. Build a small AI/data app, nothing world changing but to show I still got it
3. Change careers into SWE, though I imagine that I might have even less chance there lol

2. How many projects should I have on my resume or is 1 fully fleshed out impressive project good enough?
3. Can you provide ideas that would considered great for personal projects ? A generalization please since I know it should be something I’m interested in. 
4. What certifications should I go for if necessary?

"Just finished up college, is a field in IT, data analytics/science, or something else right for me?

I  realize this might be a tough question to answer but would greatly appreciate advice on the matter.

 I graduated with an Econ degree, concentrating in Information Systems and Quantitative Analysis with a minor in stats. 

A few years my goal was data science, but then in the last 6 months it shifted into IT because I was interested in cybersecurity and AI/Machine Learning, and how much it would pay + its potential demand. 

 But, I've been applying for the last few months into IT roles like help desk with no luck and I'm really demoralized and thinking it's just not for me. Especially getting into a field like cybersecurity which I used to think was highly in demand, but now finding out it is over saturated. I've been working on my Network+ certification with plans on getting the Security+ but now I'm wondering if I should just change my plan altogether. 

 To those in IT, data science/analytics or any other her relevant field, could you please give your insights on which field do you believe is more in demand in terms of the highest pay ceiling one can climb, especially in terms of the future? Also I'm interested in learning Python and SQL, are these applicable to all these fields? 

Is there a certain type of ceiling that each type of these job roles can reach and if so could someone with more knowledge than me help me outline where each path could reasonably get you to? It’s just a lot of information and closely related role.. I just don’t have any idea where any where anything leads to and I’m afraid of making the wrong choice.

 Once again, thank you. I'm a bit overwhelmed right now and struggling with not only finding a job, but finding the right career path for me.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTYWItQ3RDZ2xva21vUHNkTVpPcVNNOTllblZYOGN4VjM0SDdqa2hRNWNUNlFXTEF4VUM2eEhPMk1zWkZvVWFRSHhGV1JsSzJEcGkxOEJqRm5OTDRUT2c9PQ==

I also never hesitate to ask questions. Everyone has something to learn, and everyone has something to teach.

"Sure - the biggest challenge I've seen is missing the context around what they're doing. It usually manifests in a few ways - 

1. Missing the real question that's being asked. We usually get asked the immediate question, and the real question is much more complicated and buried somewhere underneath it. ""What is driving the change to projections this quarter?"" might well mean ""I don't feel like I have enough visibility into my business.""

2. Not tying work to incentives of the stakeholders, aka not explaining how the model is going to make or save the business money. A lot of data scientists think this part is self-explanatory, but to people who aren't neck deep in data, it's often not. 

3. Missing the ""real"" stakeholders. Often the end user of your product isn't the person you're presenting the work to. If we don't understand who is going to be actually using the output of our work, we can't design it in a way that helps them, and even if it gets deployed, it won't be used to it's potential, and someone will come back to us and blame us for developing a poor product. 

4. Not articulating a path to production. A lot of good models fail here because they're hard or impractical to operationalize. I once worked with a team who had a model that took 26 hours to run... and ran every day. 

The (easy to say, hard to do) solution is to think through the project from concept to delivery, and think about the stuff we don't normally think about - what the real question is, and how the solution is going to be delivered. 

There's more to unpack than that, but those are some themes. :)",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeDNYUHNYYWxiOG91cklES0MzS2pWNmx4eHFsbktfUXVLVkZMZ0lSVE9xS3RWOWZCRTVEMUQwQmk5WmVpY2d1NU5JU01sT1BvSmc1ZEZqYXFJcjREV1hOOE5OU3g3MnoxelNiN2ZVVjJOYWs9

"Easy way to practice is writing up a document communicating the project you’re working on.

"You can still practice some of the skills you'd need. Help frame up the presentations you're doing and look at what is changed. You can ask for exposure to that sort of thing. 

Even if they don't want you to make the decks, listen to the questions they ask and frame conversations so you're answering the questions they have before they ask them. The best advice I got was to anticipate the questions I was going to be asked before I got them. 

It's also worth talking to people outside the team - if you push yourself out of your comfort zone a little, you'll find it gets more comfortable.

"Why?

Not all data scientists work with machine learning, and those who do often engage in limited ML projects. 

I'm skeptical that many will implement techniques more advanced than Xgboost. 

The role of a data scientist can be ambiguous—many simply write SQL scripts and dabble in Python occasionally. Their notebooks can often be a nightmare to navigate. 

If you're excited about GenAI, consider transitioning to a Machine Learning Engineer role. Your DevOps knowledge is highly sought after, and you could even step into an MLOps Engineer position to secure a higher salary. 

I previously worked as a senior data scientist before switching to a machine learning engineer role for smarter work and better pay. 

If you're interested in GenAI, check out communities like r/llmops and r/LocalLLaMA.

Don't just study data science—it might disappoint you.

Instead, build ML pipelines and LLM apps, and aim for a role in MLE/MLOps. 

You'll likely be much more in demand.

"A lot of us are venting here, it is what it is.

I have to ask though - are your interests very broad or do you not care much about having a passion for what a company/org has as their mission? If not to both of these, how did you find 1K + postings to apply to?

My struggle right now is that I'm stuck doing mostly data wrangling at a mental health research lab. When I contribute to modelling or regressions, I always have an opposition to the process because of what, to me, are very clearly questionable research practices (usually just fishing expeditions). I want to find a posting for DA or DS in the social sciences, preferably related to housing policy, but I've only found 5 (five!!!) postings I care to apply to in a whole month. I have an Econ MA from a well known EU school, but most of the things I use as a DA are self-taught and I've frankly forgotten a lot about econometrics at this point due to lack of practice...

The grass is greener, etc etc, but I truly feel like I'd feel less hopeless if I was applying to dozens of postings and not hearing back. But I just dont find any postings I care for...and I know that if people out there are applying to 1K + postings to get their job, then surely I will get nowhere applying to just a handful per month...

"If you have about $800 look into LHH. They’re an outplacement, executive recruitment assistance, and leadership development consulting. I know a couple colleagues who’ve used them after being laid off and had very positive things to say.

They have “brand” consultants that rework your resume for both ATS and HR legibility and coaches they run basically support groups and help you navigate the whole process.

A lot of their income is from companies they hire them for laid off workers.

If you do t have $800 look into them a test just to see if they have cheaper services. Also try HR and recruiter folks more than devs/DS as they may have some advice for getting on the door.

Also dont be afraid to reach out to recruiting firms like Robert Half, Adecco, etc. Their folks are both good resources and get paid by finding you a job. Stay away from off-shore firms (they hide that fact but typically their company name and ultra thick accents are a give away), those that are  pushy, or just tingle your spidey senses.

"Pretty cool! 


I tend to tinker a lot and create products for myself, but never really go beyond that in trying to acquire customers outside of my job.



Where can one learn more about it? Like, some questions directly on my mind.



I've never heard of product hunt. I guess it's just one of the places to advertise, like what this post is doing. Where else do you make yourself present?



Product structure. What are you selling in the end? Access to the tool you deployed? How long do you intend to maintain it? What if users try to use it and the solution is down?



My front end skills are basic. I learnt that most people care about how pretty the interface looks, the tech itself is much less important. What are some resources to get that up and running even to just build a nice landing page.



Legal stuff scares me. I wouldn't dare selling a software product because I'd be afraid of the legal implications. What legal agreement do you have with your buyers? Did you just copy it from somewhere?



Taxes and seeing this as a side job. My taxes are already an international mess, so adding extra incomes like these feels like it might complicate things beyond what I want to devote to it. Questions here would probably be country specific.

"# Career Transition From Defense Industry to Data Science and ML



I currently work in the defense industry, specializing in C++ and Matlab, and I am 25 years old. I plan to pursue an M.Sc. focused on data science through machine learning (ML), as I am passionate about this field. My thesis project centers on time series analysis and ML, areas that have always intrigued me.

Despite numerous posts on this and other subreddits highlighting the difficulty of finding a job in ML, I am determined to build a career in ML engineering, data science, and Python programming.

Can anyone provide a roadmap for transitioning into these fields?

I am especially interested in strategies for keeping up with the rapidly evolving information in ML and data science, which is quite different from the more static technological environment of the defense sector due to safety and policy restrictions.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

"I work as a Senior DS and I agree that it's not a smart career move to move over to DS. It probably won't be for a long time due to the huge influx of juniors that attended DS programs at uni. I'm lucky to be able to work with modeling myself, but this is mainly due to the fact that I'm extremely specialized in one field (over 7 years of work experience). Many other DS in my company are doing mainly Data Engineering/MLOps/SWE work, or are being pushed towards doing so due to pressure from management to move existing implementations over to things like AutoML on the cloud.

Just for my interest - why do you want to move over to DS? I've heard many people say the same during my years. Unless you're very interested and experienced in statistics, building models is very shallow work, often with very limited benefits. The salaries are falling quickly as well .

"The phrase “data champion” is definitely corporate speak and more than likely from a non technical person. No self-respecting developer, etc would ever call themselves that unless it was satire.

It sounds like they want a senior dev type person to lead, but maybe not Manage? A team of folks whom monitor power bi reports/dashboards and then act on that in some capacity - something you should definitely find out the details on.

Is it an industry or company you’d like to work in but in a different role? The extra pay sounds nice though you need to weigh other options like this is probably a largely dead-end role where you’ll likely end up being a power bi developer.

"Been in data science and analytics for about 8 years now. Took a new job last fall as my prior employer had no opportunity for advancement and I felt like I had hit a dead end. The new job has been a big disappointment. I’m overwhelmingly busy and I feel overqualified, but it’s recently gone to a point where I know I can’t stay longterm. This breaking point was that I got a rush assignment and provided baseline numbers. Then sat in a meeting where the business folk plugged numbers into a spreadsheet until they liked what they saw and called it a model.

I realized that 1) my job is pointless; if they aren’t going to use the numbers I provide and if they want to fudge a “model”, which takes away a feeling of job security and 2) I can’t deal with this, from a moral/ethical standpoint.

My employer is a household name that most people would’ve heard of. These “models” they make are highly revered and have been published in reputable mediums such as New York Times amongst others.

If I could get some advice on 1) how to deal with this while I wait out the job market, and 2) when do we think the job market might recover a bit? Right now my job listing searches come back without anything worth considering and only a handful at that. Also I know I need to be in job for a while to have something on my resume so there’s that too.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUMzFwV0RFUGRZTS14M2tHRlVTb051NDVNZlI0STVadms0YVdVTGhZYlpoV0JIX25NTHdhNUZUWmhDOWZ5X3p1ejVDLTRTZHZJX0YyenZfODFsNXlMaGc9PQ==

"Wondering about a ""results-oriented"" resume as an academic. I'm an early stage academic researcher who has really enjoyed the programming and data analytic portions of my job and am looking to transition to ""industry"". However, a lot of advice suggests to make your resume results oriented. ""Implemented xyz model saving company $ amount."" etc.  
As an academic your top result is going to be things like ""published results in top tier journal"", "" presented at conference and won an award"", "" results used to win $$$ grant proposal"".  
I don't think those results seem interesting to industry, maybe some consulting firms that put out white papers.

"Here a couple of tips for you to improve:

* Put a lot of emphasis on your comms. Like double or triple down on it.
* Read others' work, internal and external, DS related and non-DS related. This will help you to understand how great story telling look like. When your team members or anyone presents try to understand what worked well and what didn't, for yourself and by reading the audience
* read books (storytelling with data for example)
* incorporate what you've learnt like that and make conscious decisions about what worked and what didn't and iterate
* get feedback and try to get mentored by people that are great communicators (I. E. I worked closely together with an internal consultant to improve my and my team's presentation skills including plotting).
* always try to get better

I'm managing people for a while now and this is a skill that I more often than not have to double down in with new hires. So you asked a highly relevant question.

Lastly a couple of general tips for storytelling:
* ask yourself who your audience is and what's most relevant for them. How will they use it? What's the business value of your work? 
* write a story with a clear call to actions and name the teams that in your opinion can or should own the action.
Keeo it easy to understand and efficient - no one wants to desipher your message or go through technical details before getting to the meat of your message.
* Keep it as simple as your audience needs it.
* plot for purpose and remove unnecessary clutter. Plots should be self expainatory even when embedded in text. Make em simple and use the title for the point you want to make. The subtitle can be used to add any necessary description.
* are you presenting? Is this a write up? What you show should be also aligned with the type of comms.
* manage the audience's cognitive load wherever you can. The focus should always be on your main points.
* be opinionated. You are the expert. You are expected to have an opinion based on the work you did.
* adjust your write up multiple times until you are really convinced that someone with way less context than you understands your intention.
* always keep it friendly but don't shy away from pointing out results that are concerning. Those are most often the most interesting ones and have the potential to initiate change. That's actually the reason why you get paid. To change things for the better :)

Those are just a few points and sorry that the above isn't very structured. I hope helps tho.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUcTRYZjZNNlRqMC15SDg3WHJQazg4TGoxX1NrNUswamZrNlJMbmRja2FkMVdfel9xM0JGeGdQSUhpVkFSZVRXX0xkb2pJckRCaHNfVWNsZnR3ay1BRWc9PQ==

"Basically every single day for the past year I've spent a few hours throughout the day searching and applying. I have a search query (""data scientist"" OR ""data analyst"" OR ""statistician""  etc...) in LinkedIn, then filter based on jobs posted within the past 24 hours and filter based on most recently posted. I go through that entire list and apply to what seems within the realm of reality of me being a potential fit for. I refresh the page a few times throughout the day to get the most recently posted jobs. I do a similar thing on Indeed, but find that Indeed is harder somehow for me to keep my focus on (maybe because they don't have company logos like LinkedIn), so I just use indeed to search in the cities I have the highest preference to relocate to.

  
I also check [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) which has a job board, and even find a lot of jobs just through google. And to answer your other questions, no I'm not only focusing on companies in my field of interest or passion. If I were to do that, I'd probably only have 5 jobs a month I'd be able to apply to haha. I was told by an alumni from my school who is now the director of data science at a large company to just apply to literally anything and everything that is remotely related to my background.

* First, I’d try to get specific about the kind of communication that you’re trying to improve; analysis docs, speaking, decks etc. Because each requires a different skillset, I’d focus on one form to begin with. Every time that you communicate, even a slack message to your team, is a chance to practice
* As I’ve worked on more docs or decks, I’ve gotten a better sense of what good communication looks like. I have a swipe file of examples of excellent communication and I’ve compiled a list of the patterns that they follow - a communication checklist that helps me diagnose if my communication is unclear. Many of the best examples follow [Barbara Minto’s pyramid principle](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/minto-pyramid-principle-scr) or answer first communication
* Simultaneously, I would also try to identify your own communications patterns and figure out which you’d like to change. For instance, I observed that I tend to get nervous before I speak, and consequently speak too fast. Slowing down my breath beforehand helps me improve dramatically. You could even recruit someone you trust to give you feedback if it’s difficult to identify these patterns yourself

I’ve found that communication is a skill where I’ll always be learning, especially as I need to adapt to new audiences with their own preferences for how they like to receive information.

Hope this helps!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUelFaVHItenlNWDQzVXRzeDdzeUljZG9BVVdsbDFPUWZncER6QlJaWTdlckVoc1A4NFRxRXZpQjN5N2V4aEZ3UnlweFNJdlNXZkRzSmVPT3V4SGdXOThFZWVDalFUcGJXbjRJTmZjTWJfZXM9

"[https://github.com/philipl/pifs](https://github.com/philipl/pifs)

π (or pi) is one of the most important constants in mathematics and has a variety of interesting properties (which you can read about at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi))

One of the properties that π is conjectured to have is that it is *normal*, which is to say that its digits are all distributed evenly, with the implication that it is a *disjunctive sequence*, meaning that all possible finite sequences of digits will be present somewhere in it. If we consider π in base 16 (hexadecimal) , it is trivial to see that if this conjecture is true, then all possible finite files must exist within π. The first record of this observation dates back to [2001](http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/01/Jun/pi.html).

From here, it is a small leap to see that if π contains all possible files, why are we wasting exabytes of space storing those files, when we could just look them up in π!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUZHFwdHpCdFhDYkhUSWhEcmJzYjZYYkhFdmJZejJ5NWZXbmVDWTFSSWFDQnlRWjF3bUlBUENNdnVIQnFTdmdwYTF5Zld3S0ZtcTJfb1VkUG5OQjQzb3c9PQ==

"Software Engineer to ML engineer is an easier transition. And personally I find that the role involves far more dev work than data science. 

I got hired as a standard backend developer a year ago and transitioned into an MLE about a month into it because of a data extraction project.

I don't think it's an ideal role for new grads unless it gets simpler. It's very much a 'do everything' role. The amount of known unknowns (being an inexperienced junior) and unknown unknowns (LLM application is very immature) can be very overwhelming. Especially if you have little guidance (it's a fast moving field for seniors too), have to communicate expectations/timelines for your projects, have tight deadlines, or are assigned 'impossible' projects set by people who don't fully understand the strengths/limits of ML.

"Retail DS Project as Transition Vehicle:

I am attempting to transition from mechanical engineering (currently doing nuclear power projects) to data science. I have a friend who is willing to refer me to an entry level role with his company, which provides a wide range of DS services to retail clients. I taught myself Python back in college for fun and went to a few hackathons, but as far as coding in industry I have only done some VBA automation (ew). 

In an effort to build up my resume, I would like to execute a DS project on retail data I found on Kaggle. The target company mostly uses Python so, with some occasional guidance from ChatGPT, I have done some initial exploration of the data with pandas, matplotlib, etc. Now I would like to move onto feature engineering, and then predictive modeling and visualization. I am looking for recommendations for where to focus my efforts in these phases. What types of features should I be most concerned with? What are some common analyses or model that are employed for predictive purposes in retail? To be clear, my aim is not to do anything novel or profound, but simply to show that I have made a good faith effort to prepare for the role.

But the key word there is 'product'.

That does not mean they are a good data scientist or data engineer. It just means that they will probably not abuse the shit out of the infrastructure and run up massive cloud bills.

"Hi, I'm a current graduate student. I received my bachelor of science in Computer Science and am currently pursuing my master of science in Computer Science concentrating in data mining and intelligent systems. During my undergrad I took courses in Python, SQL, and Mathematics along with other standard CS topics. The mathematical courses were Calc 1-3, Discrete Math, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Physics, and Elementary Statistics. During my graduate courses I've taken Intro to Machine Learning, and Intro to Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Keras. In the Fall I'll be taking coursework in AI, and Data Mining where we learn Apache Spark. The other courses will most likely be Data Visualization, Digital Archeology, NLP, Computer Vision, and some computer architecture courses.

One question of mine is what math is expected of me in this field. It's been awhile since I touched any difficult math problems (I took Calc 3 and Linear Algebra in 2020, and elementary statistics was a very long time ago). So I was curious on what I should refresh on as I'm quite rusty. My ML course didn't touch the math portion too much although I do plan on reading through the textbook to advance my knowledge.

Another is, is software such as Power BI mandatory for this field? I've messed around with it prior but I wouldn't say I have foundational knowledge with it.

And finally what is the feasibility of landing a position in MLE, Data Engineering, or Data Science? I know companies are cutting back quite a lot so I would like to at least get a glimpse of what to prepare my expectations for. Standard software development doesn't interest me too much as I wanted something more mathematical in nature and I just enjoy working with data.

Thank you.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUZ2JjcjVBc3l4NU51OWVraXBSTGd6VDVXa3F1bVpObEE4M1AyRTI1TXpIenJnYTZHczN3SGo5bVF2TUZwYi1POVI2UmhQTFhDSlJ4NzlHd1NLLWtVTVFvLU9jOWRsazlFQVlXeWpjbTRaU1k9

"Completely subjective, I enjoyed my 20s, but because of it I had to grind hard in my 30s when I had a wife and kid and mortgage and it was not as relaxing as it could have been. With that said I loved the second half of my 20s and wouldn't change it for the world. Optimally you should find a balance that you don't hate, and honestly that's the threshold that really matters.

For some context I dropped everything and solo traveled for 4 years, at age 27. I don't regret it at all and I will never be able to live that freely again in my life so I'm glad I did it when I could.

I switched careers to data at age 31, during the pandemic… then everyone else wanted to enter data. Despite having what people say is a great resume, job applications get more difficult each year and I get offered jobs with lower salaries as I get more experience.

Now I’m exhausted, I’ve had 3-4 immediate family tragedies, I’ve been laid off 3 times, and I just want to live my life for myself at this point… but I can’t afford to let my guard down, because I need to survive. I just want consistent health insurance.

"Propaganda with a healthy dose of nonsense. 

One of the most universal patterns to emerge from anthropological studies of hunter gatherer societies spread all over every continent - societies which have sustained themselves for tens of thousands of years - is that the amount of labor incumbent upon the individual to survive is vastly less than that imposed by agriculture, and later by capitalism. 

I point to our least technologically-sophisticated societies to emphasize that the notion that the cruel realities imposed by capitalism are somehow natural or intrinsic to our existence is absolutely absurd. 

Our struggle is not against nature. It's against men that use the labor of other men to create a cycle of compulsive authorority.

"Yes, but those requirements come from the nature of capitalism, ie perpetual growth. 

My point is that this philosophy is not ""natural"" - it is an artifact of capitalism. And it has been exacerbated over time. 

Even within recent memory, eg the heyday of Americas post-WW2 boom which was probably capitalism at its most benevolent, it was perfectly reasonable to expect that the skills one had acquired upon maturation would be sufficient to support oneself throughout adulthood. Support a whole family, even, on a single persons efforts.

Unthinkable today.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdmFpZzhyUXRKVGZzbF9OU1JlbW15aGFhZkNLcFVOdnlXUC1QZEN2N1NKX0lEUkZjcmVwRF9GTXQtOFN1S3F6TVVXaThPcTQySzQ3T3dkUGlZd3Y4OFE9PQ==
"As everyone else has said it’s very subjective, and your priorities and perspective will change with experience. The way I see it is an overlap of a bunch of different categories that people prioritize in different ways:

Mental Health/Stress/Work Life Balance
Short term Salary
Career Growth Opportunities
Industry Interest
Project specific Work Interest
Luck

For me, early on in my career I was more focused on career growth and salary, then realized after my first job I needed an industry that was cool because risk-averse financial banks were boring as hell. In addition to that was a whirlwind of shit with my mental health and learning how to deal with my bipolar disorder, which led me to a higher prioritization of mental health and work life balance so that kind of guided where I looked for a new job. My second job was very unlucky, and a strike out, really cool industry and really cool projects, but severely adversely affected my mental health so I had to cut that one. So I re prioritized my search and tried to look for places that more aligned with what I needed.

And then that leads me to Luck, an overlap of all categories that provide just enough of each to make you content. I wouldn’t know what contentness was at this point in my career unless I experienced what I had in the past to give me that perspective, as well as taking a leap to explore other options and not remain stagnant with no change, that will lead you to insanity. It’s like the fallacy in Reinforcement Learning of Exploration vs Exploitation, sometimes you gotta explore the world to experience more reward than what you think is out there. You may just so happen to stumble upon a company that the stars align and you probably won’t leave unless you’re fired. This won’t happen with everyone, but make sure you’re vocal at wherever you are to express what you think will make you content. 

As with most things in life it is a balancing act. Some people get hard ons for showcasing their projects and bragging about their work on LinkedIn and how they work 80 hours a week. If that’s what they enjoy then good for them they have their priorities in line and can focus on work/career growth/salary. Some people get hard ons for their hobbies and extracurricular, traveling, seeing friends and therefore their work life balance will be a higher priority. And for them I think that’s great if that’s what they love. For me, I get a hard on for not being depressed and wanting to kill myself every night before going to sleep, and that’s why I prioritize mental health over everything else. But again I wouldn’t know that unless I experienced what I had in the past. 

So to you my good sir, try not to compare yourself to others so much. Do an introspection into what you prioritize the most. Take some leaps of faith, don’t listen to the world around you, and find your peace. Only you know what will make you content.

"I agree with you on the infinite growth point as it's obviously not sustainable in a finite world. On the other hand the limitations apply only within a single business or domain and not globally as some domains die out but others emerge.

With regard to a specific domain I think it's due to the sigmoidal nature of its growth: once a new domain is discovered it grows easily and exponentially at first and then platoes bringing diminishing returns on investment of effort.

E.g. 20 years ago one could make a living from knowing how to re-install Windows and change cartridges in printers. Now one needs a CS degree from a top uni + yoe + certifications and may still struggle to find employment.

"> Usually only senior get the projects cos you want to vet them more carefully.

My experience of this has been the opposite - a relatively short project isn't going to do a good job of distinguishing between 4 decent candidates for a senior position because the skills that a short project typically tests aren't the skills you're using to pick a senior. However a short project can do a good job of demonstrating the thought process of a potential junior, showing they can code etc. 

As a senior all my interviews have been much more heavily focused on soft skills, project management, maybe delivering a presentation on a previous project that I worked on/led.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUa3lWNDBmMWZJSTk1dFg4X0NqTWI0V0JicFkzeEE1ZkdVYTdzbVMxUG1kWEJpVWVjcU1ZUjBYRy1udGNOVHNQcVdBOGZGRXZKVkVVY2xIby0tc0NyUmc9PQ==

"As a hiring manager I refuse to include any type of homework in the loop. It’s unfair to candidates, and I don’t trust candidates not to cheat. So it’s not bringing anything meaningful to me.

As a candidate, I have been asked this and last time it was a surprise. So I withdrew. I have a good job and wasn’t all that excited about the role, and springing a complex financial statement analysis on me (which isn’t what I do anyway) was too much.

Without knowing your situation, I’d say you have to balance the investment in this homework given it may not lead to a job, versus the knowledge that refusing will certainly not lead to a job.

"I'm going to mention something that's not been mentioned below.

Coefficients in non-linear models are conditioned on the other coefficients and values for the additional variables. Effects are non-linear so focusing on coefficients is a bad idea. Some people look at odds ratio but if you look at who does that the most: medical clinical trials which are experiments so they are basically blocking other variables or making other variables part of their design (like demographics).

With what you want to do, you can't do this, so I would encourage you to look at probabilities. You can check out Gelman and Hill's book on Hierarchical modeling because their chapter 3 or around that is on logistic regression and MC simulations.

The causal aspects is iffy because models show correlation, but I don't think your manager is talking causal in the proper statistics way, more in the ""I want an explanation for this"" which is acceptable for models and what the other commenter said -- thinking about confounders, controls, data structure, what is affected what and how and why, etc. not throwing the kitchen sink at your model",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcFZXeGo3Um5lWUtFQzVjTUt6d2VDQjQ4anpZU1k5T05CSkVQSTNoSmI5M3hXbHFoUkFpOWc2VktuY3pKNXp1SkFFZ3QtdjFtT3lfbFMtNWhiV2RuWlE5cGNJT0JMTjBrWTB0ZERhaFpUUEE9

"You're on both the right and wrong track. Starting with simple models first is a good idea. Linear regression and logistic regression are fairly easy to interpret and generally where I start.

"You need a price and promotion study that uses hierarchical linear models to test the variables and coefficients at multiple levels. A logit regression model won’t work because there’s too much noise in the data for it to accurately predict when a promotion is on or off. There’s also a lag effect with promotions.

"Oh sorry I missed this

Bro you've missed like an entire field of science called anthropology, which includes detailed studies of dozens to hundreds of such societies all around the world. Margaret Mead was a particular famous example; in general, a common goal has been to identify common characteristics that emerge i disparate communities and environments, so we might identify some truly human characteristics. Karl Marx was likewise interested in this field, considering a sort of fundamental communism to be a common core across the world.

But these types of societies didnt persist for just ""hundreds"" of years, as you seem to find incredible. Rather they endured for tens of thousands of years, essentially up to the emergence of agriculture, which provides war-making capacities that typically drive sustainable life styles to extinction.

You don't need some fancy source for this. It's all common knowledge you'd get in an intro-level undergrad course.

"I've recently changed roles and company, going from a managerial position into IC. Since joining it's become apparent that progression will be harder than i expected and I am in fact being moved under other less senior staff than I expected to report into. I had hoped to gain deeper technical skills in the role from learning from colleagues, but more often than not, I am actually training them on software. It's MLE, but most data work is dashboards and slides.

 I've only been here a few months but it's getting me down, because I left behind a company i had progressed well at, and am constantly second guessing if I am losing momentum in my career and potentially letting hard gained skills rust.

"Oh I didn't see all these people correct you already.

The general thrust of what is being repeated here is the same: humans, worldwide, employed a variety of labor / proto-economic systems prior to the emergence of agriculture and subsequent specialization, ie dedicated non-workers, which enabled subsequent barter and currency. 

But even following the emergence of barter / currency it was millennia before capitalism emerged, post enlightenment. And heck even now there are entire cultures, eg particularly Muslims, that view any form of usury / lending as inherently immoral, which puts some twists on what we mean by capitalism (Saudi wealth funds notwithstanding) 

Anyway, again, the idea that capitalism is the only system humans have used is just factually wrong; and, the idea that the perpetual forever-struggle for survival i modern capitalism is the only way, or how things have only been, is likewise silly",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWnVQQXJ2cXZicUV1ZUd6LXNqWDJHTmF2a1BmTmFPWUtCa3QzYmZuaXhLYS1udlNmZ01mOXk1NDdGZ1RpRlBvcVhVMUFzWDBqTFA5UDAwSUJNYTg0UVE9PQ==

"I think you made interesting points here, particularly with respect to the expansion and decay of role values.

This wouldn't be a problem if we were playing something like SimCity or Civilization or Stellaris; pops would just hop from domain/role to role in perpetuity as the relative value fluctuated over time.

But in real life we only live so long and this reductionism is terribly cruel. For example a diligent kid might mortgage their future with loans in order to get the education to be the IT guy, only to find - surprise! - were no longer valuing that gig by the time they enter the workforce. And sure folks can switch roles, but this comes with costs. And no one can predict the next big thing - if they could, why bother with a job at all, when they could just say trade to riches?

"If you have a time limit it's usually the one who spent the most time on it.  Most jobs require learning and when you have one assignment and never let the candidate defend their work you won't discover which candidate can adapt and pivot their skillset the most.

So many employers have wasted so much of my time with  bs assignments.

Lots of interviews but their not wasting free time and don't seem to have a problem with DS not having the right skills without an assignment.

It was the rampant, unregulated growth of industry, which used public air, land, and waterways as a ""free"" dumping ground, that created many of the environmental crises we live with today.

"Data Engineer build ETL pipelines (extract transform and load) for example extracting data from a database like microsoft sql server, transforming it with pandas, and loading it to a data warehouse like BigQuery. Then you might schedule that pipeline to run at a specific interval, i.e. everyday at midnight, with a tool like apache airflow or cron.

Machine Learning Engineer sources the data (maybe from a data warehouse or other sources), performs data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection. Then they have to deploy the model. Many companies do this in the cloud now. For example, an mle could train a model using Google AutoML with data that he has in BigQuery, and then deploy to and endpoint in vertex AI (Azure and AWS have their similar product offerings). There is also model retraining in some cases.

Take a look at AWS or Google Cloud certifications for example and see what their certifications talk about for these roles:  
aws has machine learning and data engineering certifications and so does Google Cloud:  
[https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/exams/)

[https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification?hl=en](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification?hl=en)

Finally, you will notice that neither Google Cloud and AWS offer a data scientist certificate, but they do offer Machine Learning and Data Engineering certificates...

A data scientist is a bit more loosely defined depending on the company. Some define it as the people developing the models and performing machine learning research, but at others places these are called simply machine learning researchers...",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcHI0T1dUWDRfODl2Z1VuTjVRZTl6RHFDTl95bGVid1RlT0tXZS1KNHJ4U0xQNjBwYURYWFhMZUwwdEZ3dmlZOVprZDlIajFZdGtfaEg0LURaX3VVcXc9PQ==

"I'm in a similar position at a mental health research lab. No outright manipulation of numbers to get desired conclusions but still negligent practices like garbagecan regressions, fishing expeditions, ignoring unexpected dataset row reduction after JOINs, what have you.

I just want to echo the dilemma of this being a common issue, which makes it hard to decide where to jump to when one wants to jump ship. It takes quite a toll, at least on me.

Today I was asked to look into LLMs, and essentially ignored when I said we shouldn't be blinded by the over-hype (ie LLM isnt what we need for causal inference, for example) and that we can't just keep throwing datasets with a lot of columns from our data warehouse without first addressing our lack of knowledge of the warehouse now that the dude that built it quit recently...these mfs really just view DA/DS as a monkey's job IMO...

"For some context: I graduated from UCSD with a B.S. in Data Science in 2023. During my time at UCSD I enjoyed learning about the entire Data Scientist workflow and applied my knowledge to some interesting projects, giving me a solid foundation in the Data Scientist workflow (data cleaning/preprocessing, EDA, viz, modeling, interpretation) 

Post grad: After graduating I got a job as a SWE. In my 10 months of working I’ve worked on 4 different projects (developed an internal MLOps tool, time series forecasting with sktime, backend development in Java Springboot, and most recently DevOps with GitLab)

My goal: I want to eventually become a Data Scientist or ML Engineer or go into MLOps. I’m afraid that if I stay on this DevOps project for too long I’ll pigeon hole myself into becoming a  SWE and forget my DS skills.

The question: Is it worth pursuing a Master’s in Data Science or CS with a specialization in AI if I want to achieve my goal of becoming a Data Scientist? Or is my B.S. degree and SWE experience enough?

"Well the one I found seemed to lay out the problem with ohe very well (dimensionality explosion with very spare data) and proposed an embedded layer as a solution, so ideally I'd like that one but I realize that might be like finding a grain of salt in a pile of sand.

So, any papers that specifically discuss the pros and cons of these two methods would suffice. I've found several that discuss embedding techniques, but I liked the idea of an embedding layer because (if I'm not mistaken), the authors created the layer size with len(df[col].nunique()). If I'm remembering that right and it works, I think it would be a great way to create a model that is flexible enough to help with the training of a large population model but specific enough for deploying to a single user, because the size of the layer is created dynamically each time based on the number of distinct values in an ""identifier"" column.

I'm trying to convince my peers that one hot encoding is not the best way to transform it identifier variable, because the dataset will become so sparse that the variable will essentially become meaningless within the calculations, and want to back up my stance.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVQkN4MDlicVkycnJITlVpa3diM3FEU3pxS2NuVjJtRkZmeTNDYXhFR1JCOElrdU5qNlNfam14dUxVeUkxcFVNekpXQlZmLTNkSFlvc2p2VHRLM2VockE9PQ==

"In Data Science x YouTube, I think there aren't as many famous Data Science influencers. Some of the biggest names that come to mind are Tina Huang @ 500k+ and Ken Jee @ 200k+, but they transitioned their content away from Data Science and into Productivity or other work topics.

However, come over to LinkedIn and you'll see a lot of influencers – there's folks like Zach Wilson for DE (300k+ followers), Daliana Liu for Data Science (200k+), Aishwarya Srinivasan for AI (400k), Jess Ramos for Data Analytics (175k+).

"I feel like leaders in an organization implicitly decide how important data will be to the organization's decision-making. Frequently, data is competing with user feedback or experts for primacy in the company's notion of truth. For instance, companies like DuoLingo lead with data.

Imo, this comes from Luis von Ahn, who is a highly technical co-founder and values that approach to decision-making.

"I think that ""using a lot of data"" is often mistaken for being ""data-driven"". 

If you run a lot of reports, build a lot of models, but decision-makers ultimately pick and choose what numbers they choose and believe and make whatever decision they want without it being retroactively scrutinized relative to a data-drive approach, then you're not data driven. The data doesn't do any driving, the data is in the trunk and it's brought out when you need it to justify your point. 

Here's what I have seen: smart companies don't fool themselves - they look at the things that can and should be data driven and make them data driven, and then they take the things they don't think can be data driven and just focused on having a well-defined, disciplined process that can be evaluated and improved on.

So, for example: I worked at a company that had incredibly stable, predictable sales and very infrequent and clear-cut price changes. That company was *insanely* data driven as it related to price changes, because they *knew* the data told them 99% of the story. There was no room for people to come with opinions to a pricing meeting. 

On the other hand, this company often introduced new products in new areas - and they *knew* that data would never answer 100% of the questions they had about products with no history. What they did do is set up a very structured process for how to approach those situations in a way that was repeatable and decomposable - so that once you got to see what actually happened, you could go back and ask ""well, what went well and what went wrong?"".

So, for example, in defining the plan for a new product you would make some choices:

1. What past new product is this most likely to behave like - and why do we believe that?

2. What is the rate at which we will introduce the product to the market from a supply chain perspective?

3. What are our anticipated marketing funds/promotions/etc going to look like over the onboarding period?

4. How have focus group results compared to past, similar products?

So the strength of that process is that once things actually happened, if you missed big it wasn't just a ""oopsie poopsie, we messed up"", it was ""well, it looks like we overestimated how quickly we could roll this out, and we overeestimated the effectiveness of ad campaign A"", which then allows you to go back and evaluate *why* you over/underestimated specific factors.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVeEtMQUJ0QTZFMk5yR29NSUxUVjVDSi1hbkotRU1lZ3piT3dHUmQ5dGtBb1I2OVc3YjA5REEyek80bzY2TncwVHJiQ3FVOVZlT244XzdTV2xsdzlUVFE9PQ==

There are two types, descriptive and prescriptive. Would you argue that ""literally"" means exactly - without exaggeration or metaphor - or does it just mean the same as ""really""? There are dictionaries that define it each way depending on whether theyre prescriptive or descriptive.

">Just the fact that ""data are"" sounds weird is enough to discredit its common usage. For most people *data* is singular.

That statement is entirely circular, though. ""I believe anyone who uses datum is a pedant trying to look smart. Therefore, you should stop using datum and if you continue to do so you are clearly a person who is just trying to look smart and tell other people who they should speak."" 

Additionally it is odd to find someone arguing against prescriptivism when their entire argument rests on handing out their personally-preferred prescription to the rest of the world. I believe you've left out an important phrase in your sentence -- that ""data are"" sounds weird *to you* should be enough to discredit its common usage *in your speech.*

There are many people to whom it does not at all sound/look weird. If theirs is not to be the master of your preference, yours cannot summarily be the master of theirs. So unless you are prepared to come out as simply a different flavor of prescriptivist, the argument you're making is not linguistic, but solipsistic.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVMHV1aFNiVTJtbHVqb1JZZzg2UXFOQ2NTaHh5VTd6UE5uUHpEdm5EdklJamxQcVpha184a1JtdGRnZl9EMy1KYl96cUliaGstN2NvV183SW15TlZBTVE9PQ==

"Wrong.

The distinction you're noticing - but misattributing - is that people often talk about a ""data set,"" which is a singular thing, without actually saying the ""set"" part.  **A data set is.**  When it is clear from context that the data in question is being discussed as a set, using plural verbs reasonably sounds a bit off.

On the other hand, ""data,"" referring to the individual data points in that set, is plural.  **The data points are.** The thing you're missing, again, is that people often omit the word ""points,"" and just expect us to get from context that they are talking about data points, plural.   The word ""data,"" in this usage, is a countable plural.  

And yes, data are countable in the English-grammar meaning, because you can write them in a list.  Or, to use the singular meaning of ""data,"" (a set of) data is countable because you can write *it* as a list.  



My favorite data set (singular) is the one where there are five data points (plural).",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVNTAySFNwSWtZNjNkY21tWVNaZnQ4MF9EM1hXc2Zha3Q2M0Vxal8yUWhpYmlndXhFNHRvcGlJUVh5bkwtQloxTHg2dmc0TDgxQnFySHFIVFJza3JrVG5WaERwV0huT21ycmVTcEtiemczSnM9
"What I’ve seen in my industry of our small DS’like vendors is:

* provide some off the shelf “solution” (usually a dashboard) in a locked down portal that requires the client connect and provide unfettered access to their data stores to fill in for like $10k-$20k.

* provide hourly billable support to offer interpretations of said “solution” on a regular clip with like 1-2 free hours monthly. $250-500/hour

* provide billable hours to modify off the shelf “solutions” with regular maintenance and patching free. $250-500/hour

* wrap each of these “solutions” plus the hours as individual packages so clients can’t just pool the free hours to have customization and interpretation done for one of the products they value the most.

* they keep all the data they can access and use it to train models and provide industry insights to other clients that those clients theoretically wouldn’t be able to have without them.

* they rely heavily on outsourcing the actual technical work to LCoL regions. Usually this means clients have very long lead time for customizations and such meaning they are more likely to keep paying for those extra billable hours each quarter for interpretation and simple customizations to present to executives and board. Kinda like MMORPG game devs making you grind xp while paying a subscription thing.

* modeling is very rare and expensive. Nothing they provide is sophisticated. 

* “ecosystem” meaning they have a bunch of stuff that’s locked into their portal and only works for their data stores and such. That way, you have a harder time as a client finding competitors and converting to them for the same results. 

* proprietary data proxy type stuff like “tech propensity score,” and whatever else. Usually some shady, opaque scoring mechanism that has no real rigor behind it that provides clients with what amounts to very made up information about their customers. Consider your clients don’t have internal expertise so they won’t even notice the distributions and such are synthetic (I’ve found this at my employer and have to have some very sensitive conversations with the executives and other leaders who’s performance and successes are pointing at these things).

"It’s about how you react to difficult situations, you see this more in senior non-technical roles.

I’ve seen this a lot using tactics like questions with no right answer; awkward silences; straight-faced/confused reactions; short replies to your answers - it helps you filter out the ppl that would panic or start rambling non-sense or lose confidence when out in uncomfortable situations. The ones that have good critical thinking and a strong ability to verbally articulate themselves stand out.

You need to react with confidence and articulate your thoughts well. If the question confused you ask clarity in a way that leads to additional information like “oh is this concept x similar to concept y(maybe explain how you made that connection)”.

"TL;DR —Thanks in advance if you read and reply!

Not strictly a data science post but is data science related and need advice on data science degree.

I am 31 y/o, went back to school recently, and is currently finishing up my second year of BCIS(Bachelor of Computer Information Systems), but am trying to decide if I want to/should even get the full BCIS degree or not. I wanted to do accounting/finance but wanted tech knowledge too so went BCIS with the idea of using all my business options & electives to take as many accounting classes as possible than switch to business for 1 year to finish remaining CPA prerequisites and get BBA Accounting degree. I am trying to decide now though if I should continue with that plan or not. Here is what I’m trying to decide between, hoping to get input from people:

—((1)) Stay on the path listed above (50 courses total & 5years school, then the 30 months for CPA PEP). Finish with both BCIS & Accounting BBA degrees. *BCIS has a mandatory non-credit 4 month work term co-op as a graduation requirement.*

—((2)) Accept offer to transfer to Bachelor of Science in Data Science w/ concentration in Finance, at same school. Would take me 42 courses to graduate instead of 40 and then would need to complete 10 missing CPA prerequisites for 52 total courses, so 5.5-6 years total and then could start the 30month CPA PEP. *BS in Data Science also has a mandatory 4 month work term co-op as a graduation requirement but it is for credit. Would make it 51 actual courses completed instead of 52.*

—((3)) Accept offer to transfer to Accounting program at same school and finish in the standard 4 years w/ 120 credits (from Canada, don’t need 150 credits only need 120 to start CPA program). Come out with Accounting BBA degree & BCIS minor.

—((4)) Accounting & Finance double major. Would take 42 total courses, 44 to still have all CPA prerequisites completed (4.5 years total then start CPA PEP).

—((5)) Either one of option 3 or 4 and then doing a post bachelors certificate or diploma in data science/analytics/Machine Learning/AI. Or even just self study along with a portfolio by completing online certifications from IBM, Microsoft and Google during or after CPA.

*Would finish with a BCIS minor in any scenario as I have already completed the necessary courses for that.

Any advice or opinions would be appreciated!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcEdYY3FLd1VqTlNjanB4RHM4YUhOdV8tVHh1WDR4Zk9IN2h1dVpwZnh0M3JOT3NreFN6SnRaUlpHZVNWS1hWbGVRcFViSXZBb2hrUjdYYzVZQUM5b2c9PQ==

"I think you hit many of the top data science influencers I'm aware of.

If you broaden ""data science"" to analytics (eg I'm an applied statistician, but I might mainly work in sql, prefer spreadsheets and bi tools), there is a much larger group.

For what it's worth, I've been thinking about this and am happy to share my thoughts -- I'm certainly no authority on the topic though.

1. Firstly our space is already very small and niche. There are huge skin care influencers, but there's also a ton of people with skin.
2. Proportionally, fewer data scientists want to become an influencer:

I think there's a large barrier to entry, since the opportunity costs for data scientists to move to ""influencing"" full-time is so high. Why quit your comfy, well-paid, fancy, often-interesting research and/or corp job to make pennies on the dollar sharing content on social platforms? And so, there's just a smaller pool of people who want to create and share content.

3. Data science influencers  grow slowly, and it's early days.

Also, I think these folks audiences and reputation will grow much more slowly then in less-niche, very broad topics. I could be very wrong, but I see the data science influencer crowd as being biased towards folks who are very good communicators, more charismatic, and they value sharing with others what they've learned. While many folks who are more technically minded (by that, I mean people developing new methodologies, contributing to packages & tooling, writing the most popular books and text-based resources I'm aware of) are -- no offense -- less skilled on-camera, and often couldn't care less about social media beyond blogging or giving conf talks.  
And so those technical folks, who we might prefer make more content, tend to make cool stuff, write blogs, books and talk at conferences. Their content is very technical (harder for broad audiences to appreciate), content that's unlikely to go viral.

I think that means these the aspiring data science influencer crowd mainly grow audiences first with novice/learners, and people considering applied stats as a major or career. Therefore these folks won't have much of a reputation until their audiences become more senior.

Josh/StatQuest (the biggest I can think) I think has only been full-time for 2-4 years now. I personally think Josh is amazing, a really lovely person, makes great videos and has a fanbase that agrees ... but he's \\[""only"" growing at 20k a new subs a month\\](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/joshstarmer). So, that's an ""it's very early days"" argument, for why we don't see many big folks.

That is, while a travel influencer might be able to grow quickly, in the ds space, folks with no reputation will probably take a long time and a lot more work to grow a sizable audience.

4. The most popular ""data science content"" is domain-specific, & domain experts talk about our work better than we do.

And then I feel no-one has really cracked the format to make data science in-and-of-itself more broadly interesting. I feel the most ""viral"" data science'y content tend to be interesting plots (see r/dataisbeautiful, chartr-daily) and great data journalism. The content that really blows up is often attached to a specific domain.

For instance, 538 has amazing data scientists sharing their work, but Nate Silver isn't know as a ""data scientist"", he's well know an elections modeler and sports analytics expert.

"Hey all, nice to meet you. Been lurking here for a minute and figured this is the best place to ask this question. This is all over the place so apologies in advance.

I’m a chemist and worked in process engineering for manufacturing organizations for 13 years now. Learning and utilizing stats programs like JMP and Minitab was a huge key to my success in experimental design, data driven decision making, and technical communications both up and down the corporate ladder. I’m typically doing regressions, ANOVA, t-tests with Tukey Kramer analysis, some optimization modeling, control charts, outlier tests, stddev etc and all the other baseline tools needed for a non-stats person to pretend like I know what I’m doing lol.

Stats work + data processing have been the most enjoyable part of my journey thus far and also feel it would open up many career opportunities in the future.

My goals are expansion of abilities for director level roles that require technical background (chem and process devt) with expanded abilities in data processing and statistics - potentially clinical trials and the like. Alternatively, a full blown career change to DS or stats for manufacturing organizations may be equally fulfilling.

My problem is: I’m not really certain what I’m getting myself into. What is doing graduate level statistics like in school? And what is it like in industry? 

Would anyone care to share their perspectives on the above to help me make a more informed decision?

Not really sure what your point is here since ""data"" is *also* Latin, and the bit about there being very few doesn't seem terribly relevant. 

Regardless, your claim that they are always Latin is incorrect.

"I won't defend it, and I always shared what I learned, but one thing you may not realize is that person may have gone through pain and agony to figure these things out themselves, often with no help or guidance, and somehow navigated through to be SME's. And suddenly, there you are, taking a short cut never offered them, demanding information they went through many obstacles to acquire themselves, and they may feel resentment that it is so easy for you, after they laid all the groundwork. They may even be stuck in their careers from all that back-end work, which is often unappreciated or rewarded, and there you are, all young and shiny and energetic, moving forward on your career in what they perceive as climbing on their backs.

Do they have a right to withhold their hard-sought information? No, it's not theirs, and never was. But having worked over the years with many SME's like this, I believe you need to master the art of appreciation, of small talk, of valuing what others achieved, of becoming one with them, and giving credit where credit is due.

"Information is not free. 

Good, valuable information is rare.

If you were in OpenAIs insider circle, you would get rich very quickly from the information they share. They have all the data, all the market trends, all the user information, all knowledge on the models and how to optimise them. Their information is very important and they spent billions to discover it.

It sounds like you want information, so you think it should be free.

If you discovered very valuable information, let’s say you spend 12months in isolation working on a novel project, you wouldn’t want to give your methods out for free, when you could patent it or productionize and sell it for millions, giving you generational wealth. Or would you give it away for free? Academia is the only industry where methods and knowledge is shared for free, and as a result, salaries and pay is much less in this industry because everything is transparent, but at the cost of greater respect and status.

This is a biased argument because you want something others have. 

Instead discover valuable information that others want from you, not only will you understand the power of information, but your career will exponentially yield you results.

">Regardless, your claim that they are always Latin is incorrect. Japanese loanwords like [ninja](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ninja), [manga](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/manga), and [kana](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kana) end in ""a,"" are plural, and can be followed by the word ""are."" For example: ""Ninja are known to be sneaky,"" or ""Kana are the basis for collation in Japanese.""

Oh thanks for pointing out that some Japanese words end in 'a' and fit the criteria as well, awesome!

At the same time, I don't feel you represented my whole criteria all that well. Further, These Japanese words and their grammar were borrowed and do not have much historical impact on what I think most English speakers would consider normative or obvious. So have less weight in the discussion, unlike Latin rooted words.

Also to be pedantic, Ninjas is a typical plural form of ninja.

""u/ttcklbrrn was attacked by reddit ninjas"" is typical to indicate many individual ninjas.

Not ""u/ttcklbrrn was attacked by reddit ninja.""

And this whole conversation is about what's more immediately clear/typical for English speaker.

But I can understand why you would be confused. In your example, Ninja refers to the category which ninjas belong to, so it is a ""Collective Noun"" (part of my second point in my original comment). And collective nouns do not refer to many individuals, but to a singular category (Ninja) of which many individuals (ninjas) belong to.

I don't think many English speakers would read ""Ninja are often sneaky"" and think you're referring to many particular ninjas you could point at. The typical understanding would be that you're referring to the singular category we call ""Ninja"", while you *might* be incidentally bringing it up in order to imply that ninjas are nearby.

This is my primary point. The whole ""data are"" discussion hits on a nuanced confusion between plural nouns and collective nouns.

When one says ""the data suggests"", I think we really mean ""The collection of data I interpreted and summarized into singular personal interpretations."" or ""the category of all data recorded during that time""  interpretations/recorded observations at some time are categorical summaries, not many individual instances of that summary's category.

Another example of this confusion in language is in categorical syllogisms. Saying:

""All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. therefore...""

A more formal way of phrasing the middle statement is

""All (people who are the famous ancient Greek named Socrates) is a (man).""

Now this may seem pedantic, because there only ever was one such Socrates, but it shows how when forming categorical arguments/referents (e.g. like 'the data suggest') we can hide that such a thing is a category because we're relatively familiar with it in our senses. I'm familiar with images and statues of what Socrates may have looked like and these images are what I think of when I consider him. So I may not think of him as belonging to a singular category. Even though he really is part of a category, despite there being only one member.

Similarly with data, we may be too close to our senses and imagination (imaging stark tables, and records)",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVR0NHRGVNNVBQTEdHcnB1ZTBjZ3VjYjhxVEFlSGlONXFoQXdBSS1FcTlaQUFJSl82NGEyVHl3VVVzOEpWcHlGN3lsTTFsNUtpNTZiajkwNDd0QU1ZMmc9PQ==

They kept everything in their heads, they considered it “layoff insurance.” I’ve never agreed with that. Everything I’ve done has been documented in a report or entered into the data lake. I consider this a fundamental part of my job (I work in R&D). To me, if it isn’t documented, then it was never done. Sure, knowledge is power, but you get little if you just hoard it. Better to use it as currency, to exchange with others for your benefit and the company’s. It doesn’t have to be straight quid pro quo, but if you find certain people are always taking but never giving, don’t deal with them. To me, this is just politics 101. But if information is used for evil purposes, then you have a toxic culture, and I lay the blame squarely on management.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVV1VDRjNZcTlrQTBRQUlpcjRfLUY2cC1Ebi1lZDE5RUFidXlNbmJJYjFkTWgtd200Zmh2U251NzI2OFdraWhnOTJUS0xrclhRdkVfUkRETFoxVW53UEFYWHFiR2QwOGhCSEdXSlZkaHJKdTQ9

"I'm working in a big company and my task was to enhance a model from a co-worker of another team.
The guy was not willing to share any code snippets (because according to him they are his) and he was even gatekeeping the data. When I talked with his team leader about the issues, he was sorry about it, but not willing to take any actions, because he is the only person on his team with knowledge about the model and cannot afford to lose him.
Throughout my 3 years there I had many similar encounters, some because of laziness some because they want to remain the person in power.

The results were (given this is only me) is that I became much more valued by the organization. I became the person known for solving tough problems, I got to hand off what I discovered to other people and then work on the new hard problems. This gave me much more practice at solving tough problems, which then made me even better at it. 

The gap between me and my co-workers at solving difficult problems grew, and I was able to find managers who gave me a lot more flexibility so I could pursue areas that interested me. Others have mentioned stack ranking (which we don't use) but we have a relatively high annual layoff as a percentage of our company and I've never really been worried about it.

"Hey! Hope everyone's doing well.

I'm having some trouble making a decision and would appreciate any help from people to assist in making a choice.

I come from a non-CS or non-quantitative background (but from a STEM field) from a Canadian university for my undergrad, and I completed a DS-focused professional master's program at a well-known Canadian university as well. I completed a year long internship during my program.

Recently, I was fortunate enough to be given a chance to enroll in a research-based master's program for a degree related to Machine Learning. At the same time, I landed a job at a pretty good company with a good salary for a SWE position. This job I got through my connection, which was very fortunate for me.

I want to pursue a career path in data science or data engineering in the long run. I'm wondering which one I should choose: should I pursue an additional graduate degree for a paper publication, or should I accept the job offer? I've heard from people around me that not getting a research master's will haunt me like a taboo, and I can't make a decision between the two. What would you do if you were me?

"No worries, and full disclosure, I am not a hiring manager or anything -- just a dude who's been a data scientist for 5 years because that's what you did in 2019 after getting a pure math PhD if you didn't want to go into academia, haha. (I'll have to look for another job soon myself, my company's not doing well, and I'm a little terrified of the process!) Also, I am in the US, not Canada.

Gut feeling again: an internship is much better than no experience, especially a year-long internship if you were able to produce a couple nice ""wins"" for your resume while you were there. Honestly, I missed you describing your internship when you wrote your original comment. My bad.

That said, I still wouldn't quite put a year-long internship on par with normal full-time salaried work experience. And even if others would and I'm just being a downer, 1 YOE isn't that much.

SWE experience would be extremely valuable if you want to be a data engineer, and even if you want to be a data scientist, SWE skills are only becoming more and more valuable. I've picked up a lot over the years, like I'm fine containerizing stuff, my code is clean, I can make a little Flask server for people to interact with my model/code with, I'm down with best CI/CD practices etc now... but SWEs and people who have a deeper CS background still run circles around me with some of that stuff. And God forbid you ever try to get me to work on anything front-end, lol.

Even if you publish a paper, I'm not sure how much another Master's will push you over the edge for jobs. While there are definitely people out there with Master's degrees that have cool research jobs, the majority of research jobs are going to want a PhD, preferably with directly related ML research but if not then in one of the usual suspects like math, stats, CS, econometrics. On the other hand, I think SWE experience will move the needle for non-research jobs (the vast majority of jobs) much more than a paper. 

Get as many opinions as you can. Both choices could potentially lead to you kicking yourself down the line, and like I said, I'm just some dude, haha, not a career coach or hiring manager.

"Yes, that's correct. ""Data"" is technically a plural noun, with the singular form being ""datum."" However, in common usage, ""data"" is often treated as a singular noun, especially in informal contexts. Good to be aware of this distinction, especially in academic writing. Using ""data"" with a singular verb form like ""is"" or ""has"" is generally considered acceptable in modern usage, but purists may still prefer to treat it as plural and use verbs like ""are"" or ""have.""

"'Data champions' is a corporate term - at least that's how I know it. It's basically an employee who is proficient in a given software - that could be Excel, VBA, PowerBI, the sales software or whatever else valuable tool the company is using. 


They're the first person to contact if a normal user™ has a question or needs help with their work. It's typically one effort towards building a community around a certain tool or set of tools.   


Example: John wants to set up his first PowerBI dashboard, so he asked Alice , the power user, to help him set up. Alice does that and recommends some beginners courses on the topic.  A year later John is proficient but might need help with more advanced usecases - in which case he asks Alice for help again. She might help him with PowerBI or write a python script in KNIME or a VBA macro in Excel.



It can be an interesting job (or subset of tasks) if that's the kind of thing you like. If it were me, I'd be interested what other community building initiatives they might have and how much of it would be part of the advertised role.

"The distinction is whether you are talking about a discrete collection or not. So called noncount nouns or mass nouns like in your example water are treated as singular, because of their inherently uncountable nature, or are otherwise undifferentiated units of stuff.

You don't give many help, you help a lot. You have a lot of water, not many water. The issue with data is, that in data science it's not rare for you to know exactly how the data looks like, how many pieces of information you have. To data scientist the data which they write about is oftentimes a group of *known* individual facts, which makes data a discrete group of units of information and therefore a counted group of things.

Please keep in mind that this distinction is usually only made in academic papers (or coworkers you don't want to grab a beer with after work) and normal people will simply always use data as mass noun.

Anyway, relating back to one of my points above, can you help me think of any examples where phenomena is used in the plural non-collective form and immediately followed by the word 'are'?

I can't think of one, nor can I induce chatgpt to return any such examples. The closest I can get are examples like:

>""Various atmospheric phenomena, such as lightning and tornadoes, are often studied by meteorologists to better understand weather patterns.""

The jarring prosody between 'are' and a plural word ending in -a is softened by an aside that separates them. It may also help when such an aside makes it clear that the noun is plural and non-collective, since 'lighting' and 'tornadoes' are specific and individual phenomena being referred to. That, and having 'tornadoes' next to 'are' just feels like good ol' murican english!

Also, after a bit of research it looks like this phenomenon (hah) poses some difficulty in the court room and is perhaps the reason why they say ""the (individual) members of the jury were seated"" as opposed to phrases like ""the (singular category) jury was seated"".

"Your comment is the exact reason I wanted to combine some kind of technical knowledge to an accounting/finance background. Probably want to get my CPA as well.

What’s your thoughts on the following options I am trying to decide between? 

1) Finish with both a BCIS degree & an Accounting BBA degree. All CPA prerequisites done. 50 courses/150 credits.
*BCIS has a mandatory non-credit 4 month work term co-op as a graduation requirement.

2) Bachelor of Science in Data Science w/ concentration in Finance. 42 courses/126 credits. Add 10 courses to complete CPA prerequisites and get Advanced Accounting certificate. Add additional 3 courses for other missing business courses needed to receive accounting BBA degree on top of the BSDS degree if I feel necessary.
*BS in Data Science also has a mandatory 4 month work term co-op as a graduation requirement but it is for credit.

3) Get BBA in Accounting. 40 courses/120 credits. BCIS minor. All CPA prerequisites completed during degree. +30 months to complete CPA. 

4) Accounting & Finance double major. 42 courses to graduate with accounting/finance BBA double major, 44 courses to do it and still have all CPA prerequisites completed.

5) Either one of option 3 or 4 and then doing a post bachelors certificate or diploma in something like data science/analytics/Machine Learning/AI. Or even just self study along with a portfolio and completing online certifications from IBM, Microsoft, AWS, and Google either during or after getting CPA.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWWVlEZ3FPeGk5YjhPTFVqanR4dndPeHlncDBPN29iUTBGRDg0T3YwYU0xYWlsVmhYM3ZTSW4zYUtDb0dJV2ZrY05rNFBhX2xhazZmVk85TDRmNWdxbEE9PQ==

Honestly what helps me is that if there’s an idea or project that I’m curious about then I’ll try to just go do it—don’t worry too much about the consequences if you feel really aligned with what you’re doing.

Echoing what others said, there is a certain upkeep that we have to take in our fields and that’s not going to change soon. But it could help to reframe the problem as what you’re doing for yourself, intrinsically and at the current moment, than what you expect you need to be.

"**Should I self-study data science or work towards actuarial exams?**

I’m graduating from a Big 10 school in a few weeks as a math/statistics major. I didn’t have good enough grades to get into my schools MS stats program and was too late to apply to others. So I’ve been working towards taking the SOA actuarial exams instead. However, as I’ve been studying for these exams, I’ve realized how much I enjoy learning applied math and statistics concepts on my own. It’s making wish I could take graduate-level courses in statistics and making me reconsider the actuarial route. 

Unfortunately, most stats-related jobs usually require a graduate degree (that was why I was drawn to the actuarial exams since you just need to pass the exams to demonstrate proficiency in a topic and can do that on your own). And I don’t have the technical skills needed for a data analyst job since my degree was more theoretical. 

But I’m wondering if the time I’ll be spending studying for the actuarial exams (which is a lot; about ~200 hours/exam on the lower end, and there’s multiple exams) in the upcoming months could instead be used to bridge the gap in my skillset for data analyst roles. Meaning I could easily become proficient in the skills needed for an entry-level position in a *fraction* of the time needed for the actuarial exams, and hopefully land a job, then reapply to an MS Stats program for next year. Besides, I hear graduate degrees are becoming increasingly valuable for actuarial roles in recent years. 

The only downside is that actuarial exams have a well-defined structure so you know exactly what you need to study and how to apply those topics, and there’s lots of resources on it. Plus, it’s a very linear career path. And each exam serves as a proof that you understand the relevant topics. It’s difficult to prove this when self-studying stats/data science (outside of a GitHub, I suppose). I don’t see any online certificate programs that seem worth it, except maybe the one Google has (please let me know if there’s others worth looking into)!

I’d appreciate any input on this!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWdEFfeDZodWxYeFhGRll0ak1GX05xSXRVOGVwcHFybDhLLUM2SElVUWlSTGxMWUhGQmprZHNYU2hIVGJTT3RFWS1qMWwzTjBPZDhvVzVRbTJRd3RuZFE9PQ==

"Yeah, I feel I shouldn't have to be doing this much work to convince him, but here we are lol. My colleague (who is a literal, definitive genius) thinks that in federated learning, since we have no access to data, we have to build the centralized model with one-hot encoding and just keep a count of how many users we would have. So then we maintain a table on the users device with that number of columns and just update it every few months, but train on that dataset with all of those empty ohe columns. ""It's a neural network, it will be fine"", but he's saying that we HAVE to build the most basic version of the model possible, we can't generate any synthetic data or acquire any data to build a baseline estimate, because that is the point of federated learning.

I disagree with that, and feel a dynamically determined embedding layer:

based on one or multiple categorical variables that would include ""user_id, as a way to distinguish one user from another and making the size of the layer dependent on range(user_id), so it scales properly on the patient device with 1 id, or the centralized model with the outputs from whatever number it ends up being....

would be enough to ensure each user has a chance at receiving a personalized recommendation that would improve over time.

"I recently got my PhD (M26) in ML and have got a consultant style job for the region. I spent the last 4.5 years grinding to learn as much as I could and develop my skills as much as possible, I also dedicated myself to the gym and fixing my diet to get myself in shape. Professionally it has certainly paid off and my health is the best it ever has been. 

On the flip side, I have become more distant from most of my friends and my family. Especially my parents - my Dad and I went on holiday together last year and even after that I feel like I have missed out on so much time with him. Since starting my journey there have been 6 funerals of family & friends that I convinced myself not to attend because ""they would want me to continue working to succeed"". It doesn't help that I live away from home but I can tell you I wish I had the chance to say goodbye properly to those people.

6 months ago I got back into painting warhammer, I also gave myself permission to play video games more often. These things work for me as perfect relax time when I'm away from work and I've found that when I have the hobbies as well, the quality of my work improves on the days I do work. 

I would encourage you to strive for balance, theres far more to life than work! Spend time with friends and family while you can and live in the moment. For me, I have a strict schedule of when I allow myself to do any work stuff, then outside of those hours I split between hobbies, socialising and gym. If you stick to work and work alone, burnout can be severe and can take a long time to recover from. So be curious and pursue a better version of yourself. The rest will work itself out.

"Because you’re looking at buckets of promotions and they’re all related, you can’t use an independent modeled approach because the promotions run on top of each other and they’re usually highly correlated. You either get into it using a hierarchical linear regression where coefficients are modeled separately and you create a new dependent variable or you use the HLM which allows you to bucket things. Consider it a mixed effects regression model if it makes you understand it better.

Edit to add: when I ran price and promotion studies at Nielsen for manufacturers, we often used the HLM to understand either promotional campaigns as the buckets or we ran the types of promotions as their own buckets.

"Fraud Analysis Courses and other tips

Hello y'all!

I'm currently working as a data analyst for an auditing company that is starting to be proactive in their audits. The plan is to start using ML or any automated process to detect frauds or unusual transactions within the clients financial reports. 

Researching I found different ways to deal with data to cluster them. KMeans, KMode, KPrototype. My data is all over the place and mostly mixed data, that's why k-prototypes might be a thing. Additionally, my data has millions of rows, but not necessarily highly dimensional, less than 50 columns/features.

I'm also aware of PyOC, which uses different methods to find outliers, mostly using only numerical fields. Whomp whomp. 

I guess what I'm looking for are tips on courses or resources that I can consume to better prepare when the requests start coming. Any tips are appreciated!

Thanks!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWRjlIblU0QUVITF9GV2g1cTZ3OGFQUk9uMU10bC1paDRTenI0UEdxelp6UWt2S2lyTjJYQ3laMFBwbGM2dzZJTVpFQUo2ODZOdWFtWmZKWWJMTG9sS2c9PQ==

Make sure to find the reasons and logic as to what method you want to use.

"Today? Tomorrow? Probably not a lot. It’s a colossal investment to get a data science team off the ground. First you need a mature data analytics team, then a mature data engineering team, then a mature data infrastructure… *Then* you’re ready to benefit. A lot of companies are pushing to implement AI before they even have a mature data analytics team, much less the data infrastructure to support CI/CD AI development.

But, that long-term investment is useful for the same reasons that data analysts are a useful investment. As data scientists, we’re not here to tell you how to do business things. That’s your job. I always yield to my stakeholders’ domain knowledge. We’re here to understand which decisions you need to make and provide analytics tools to equip you with more information to make those decisions. *That’s* the value of AI: a well-supported team can provide great information to aid in decision-making. The guy in the article who said that it “ultimately comes down to learning [the new tools]” is spot on. I can’t tell you “this provider is committing fraud and you need to sue them” - but I can build a tool which says “based on previous patterns, this provider looks suspicious and it sure seems like we should sic a fraud team to investigate.”. That suggestion is based on a lot of data scrutinized by data analysts and structured by data engineers. It takes a village, and a lot of companies ignore that fact in favor of a catchy marketing term.

"I recently reviewed a thesis where the author applied classic machine learning models (random forests, support vector machines, etc) to a set of equipment maintenance data.  After training the system, selecting the best model and applying it to the test data, they then looked at the cases where the chosen model gave a different predicted result than the test data.  In 90% of those cases, it turns out, after more careful evaluation, that the human generated labels in the data were wrong and that the ML method was actually correct.  So in a sense, while it wasn't the purpose of the tool, it identified data quality problems in the source data.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWUHplZmcxRnRrYlQ2XzF1ZTJyNFk4RmpSQk51QWZKX3NLUDJXOVk5dURRUzd2UTZSVTdiY05TRTNxaC1HY25HeWo3SWJzTzYyS2dGQVp2S3ZhMW5uaUE9PQ==

I definitely agree there is some degree of benefit of implementing algorithms from scratch because often times people don't really have mathematical intuition and just blindly use packages. Sometimes I low-key get disappointed because I see data scientists use sklearn's implementation of SVM but not know what a RBF kernel is or can't derive something trivial like bias variance tradeoff for mse. I don't expect ppl to be able to bound the hypothesis space for something like pac learning but they definitely should know the very basics such as why autodiff works and criterions needed for a model to converge.,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU3RzX2hmUDhxVElFWW9uMzV1d1BnZUJ4U25fa21HSUNHNjN4bG83SkNzWDVDTHBHWk5kSkN4TnB5MXhmeTNrbHRKd09wZVAwQW1FRDJGNlBYUGFvY3dpazJtRUR0cWlaU05NVXBJSk9vNXc9

An average human using AI will likely get to an acceptable answer to C than an average human without AI. AI will also make getting to B easier for most humans.

Scientist implies someone who has a PhD and has published original research in a peer-reviewed journal.

"My sense — at least from the discussion here — is that data scientists don’t know or don’t care about math, which is kind of necessary if you want to do scientific research in statistics or machine learning. 

I saw a post about this fresh grad with tons of grad level math courses under his belt from a top school who was not getting interviewed; everyone was just harping on him not having work experience / internships. This was strange because some of the most scientifically oriented firms (quant funds or real labs) care about the rigor of your education and your raw problem solving ability. Quant funds don’t even care if you have ever done finance before, just whether you can solve hard problems. I thought that attitude would permeate DS too but it doesn’t.

Out lab had an environmental monitoring project with an institute involved, that did the work on the data. We got the final report and with nice plots in it. Our head of the department told everyone (even on confereces), this Institute used ""data science"" to analyze two years of the monitoring. 

After reading the python files I realised what they did was only sorting an grouping huge amounts of data. They interpolated missing data with linear Interpolation using pandas. They then performed some math on the level of elementary school. They then plotted some nice diagramms using matplotlib / seaborn. That was all and everyone called it ""data science"".

And thats the problem in my option. People are mixing up ""data engeneering "" - handling and plotting big data for example - with data science, where for me, scientifical methods and therories are applied to the data to get new Insights or proofe theories. 

I often export data to pandas, sort and filter this data, do basic calculations and plot it for reports - but i would never consider myself a data scientist.

"Communication is a skill that people have different aptitudes for, the same as any other. It’s not something you can just assume that any person with a PhD can learn to do well, loads of them can’t, and PhDs set you up poorly to do it. 

The fact you think it’s “faff” suggests you have quite a narrow idea of the work data scientists tend to do. You seem to assume people will be working in places like quant firms or DeepMind or OpenAI where senior leaders already take it as a given that you know what you’re talking about and have something valuable to say.

In most places, that’s not the case. You have to convince them that you know what you’re talking about, that your work can be trusted and that you’ve dealt with whatever concerns they have, in language they actually understand.

"I think you are exaggerating the time to learn docker and CI/CD for data scientists and most companies. 

Quite frankly, docker is one of the best data science tools available. It lets you share the same environment between the entire team, dev, and prod. Being able to run a container is typically sufficient. 

The CI/CD knowledge I see requested is also pretty sparse. They want unit tests, linting, and formatting.  Again, very basic skills to improve the quality and effectiveness of your team.

Personally, I believe my company overvalues the scientific portion of data science.

My manager was criticizing Master’s degree level data scientists because they are overtrained on implementing existing ML algorithms on different data and use cases.

"As an MBA who understands business, picked up the technical skills, and has now been working as first an IC then manager and now director over data science for more than a decade, the truth is that for most DS roles the soft skills and business acumen are more critical than the technical skills. Unless you’re working in a FAANG company and you’re developing applications straight off of research papers mostly what you need to be able to do is understand the business problem, understand and manage the data, select the right model, and use an off the shelf implemention combined with good SWE practices to deliver an effective solution. None of that actually requires getting down into the math of, for example, how the machine actually minimized the loss function of your XGboost model (or even what the loss function is for that matter). SWEs use libraries all the time without understanding the low level details of their construction, it’s not a big deal. 

Now if you’re doing a lot of more stats type stuff like designing full factorial experiments then yes, you need to understand the underlying math. But I’d guess that for most data scientist in non-big-tech firms most of their work is just building a succession of classification and regression models that are fairly plug and play.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiYmY4a1hHbFhsZk9xeHZjcWFlOG1VSVhUcGhJRzczU2tFbmp0dEJHcEkxb3AyWmxFb0hGU3g4dXZaLVRZeHhvaHRLQTRTckE4RVVWRDk0bFRsLTg1bEE9PQ==

"Karl Popper’s positivism is the key difference. In science you can’t really prove something, but you can reject competing hypotheses for a phenomena. In other words, science proceeds via negative rejection, slaying one idea at a time until the best (or at least most resistant to falsification cough string theory cough) are left standing.  

AI follows a drastically different path, in which money flows to leverage massive computing power to validate a vision. Generative AI is even weirder - we construct new positives through association. 

So in this sense, the term “data scientist” actually would mean the opposite of what the job actually entails. I imagine if Popper had heard the term, he’d assume you’d spend most of your time demonstrating what can’t be done with the data. 

Though I don’t want anyone to take this as if data scientists are somehow lesser. IMO, the strenuous process of cross-validation and data withholding are marks of better discipline than most scientists practice. I once tried to publish a paper using AI to show that a commonly accepted theory was inadequate to form predictions, and the peer reviewers weren’t able to comprehend cross validation (they called it “fake data”). I do think there is room for a more rigorous concept of the “scientist” part of the word, but as long as most development occurs because of VC money and short term goals, the “data” part will be primary.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiVl9IcDM3My1URUFTUlNzV192MW0zLW0xMlhvYkZ4Z08yOHRXUmlJbUd6czMyWDBBVVVtMkt3UW9iTWc1S3VuRUE5ZVloMER3Tm5ucC1lSHpoU0FaZnc9PQ==

"Bit late but I come from a scientific background (biotech), and I think this has really helped me think about problems in a different way to other people on the teams ive been on. The more i progressed, the less I used the normal libraries that youd typically use as a data scientist and went more into putting things into production (SWE). at the end of the day, data science is an iterative process, just like being at the lab. Try a model based on some intuition, if it works, keep it and move on. I suppose anyone can do this, and it doesnt require understanding how to multiply two matrices. I have since forgotten all the math involved because Im not in research. When I was in biology, I worked on bacteria. I didnt need to know every bacteria on earth to do research, and i certainly knew nothing about the cellular processes of the bacteria I was working with. If the bacteria turns green -- good, no color -- change approach. Likewise, I view data science in the same way. As you progress you get a certain intuition for when to use boosting or how many layers you need to make something happen.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJielRMeTBVTl8yR2JNR1d0cVRLRjVoZnNXYlFRNkZYRU9Sb0NVODF6OW9Wb1B3YmJTbkgwMlF1aHE3MnVIcEtiajNIRDJ3dWJUR25nSU16TjFKdlNPTnc9PQ==

"This is what copilot had to say about science vs. engineering. It summed it up pretty well, IMO. Scientific method: state question, do background investigation, formulate hypothesis, design and execute experiments, analyze results and draw conclusions, publicize results. Engineering method: define problem, constrain/scope problem, propose possible solutions, build a prototype, test/refine, productionize. Based on that definition, most people outside of academia and FAANG are doing engineering. Copilot’s final thoughts: 1) scientists focus on understanding nature; engineers focus on practical solutions 2) many projects fall in a gray area between science and engineering.

"It feels like a significant and important STEPPING stone to something more transformative, which so far I think e can only see the following aspects of as being a sure thing: 

1) A very natural and intuitive Human-Computer interface. ""Natural language is the new and hottest programming language"" as Andrew Kerpathy once said. I think this will become even more apparent when multimodal models that can understand and respond in expressive speech become more prevalent (such as GPT-4o and any other systems currently training on this end-to-end multimodal architecture) 
 
2) Systems that can automate or at least make very efficient and accessible various kinds of highly cognitive tasks -- such as homework tutoring, long-text analysis, etc. 

3) Agentic system: Too early to tell what this will look like, but it seems like the general LLM / LMM / LAM landscape is evolving in this direction. 


So I don't think LLM's are hype in what they represent: 

- A significant milestone in making machines that don't just follow human instruction, but are capable of some degree of understanding human intention behind the instructions. 
- The foundation of systems that will be far more intelligent, autonomous, and intuitive to interface with. 


But as of this current moment, if we stayed totally frozen where we are in LLM development / adoption / integration, then yes -- it's not transformative on its own. Not for most people at least. 

In short, I think the hype is justified, assuming that neural network and cognitive architecture research, training, and development continue on the same pace. 

But what we have now feels like... the first webpages of the 90's, or the first capacities touch screen phones of 00's.

"I work for a tech CEO that is constantly just spewing LLM word salad.

"Yeah, and each big release has a declining rate of improvement (and by this I mean actual improvement for every day use, not theoretical numbers of a chart). Don't get me wrong, LLMs are important and a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. Honestly, I could see them replacing traditional search engines in the near future.

That being said, I've seen all the graphs which show the capabilities of these models increasing up and to the left. I think this models are really up and to the right in my every day work. They are better than the last update, but each update is more and more underwhelming. The writing level is around a upper-class high school student, and has been for a while.   
  
Take for example cars. Cars have been getting more efficient for a while (in terms of energy consumption per unit of distance), but they archived this efficiency piece meal over multiple iterations. That was true until a fundamental change was introduced, the hybrid/electric vehicle. LLMs will continue to improve, but I don't expect any huge advancements any time soon. I also think that LLMs are hitting a wall in terms of added value; a wall that simply throwing more computing power will not solve.

"Not at all. IMO, the people that think its all hype happened used them. Some use cases:

- Transformed Human Computer Interaction and Design  
- Universal Language Translator  
- Simple Jarvis-like assistant  
- Automating LOTS of tasks (generating recurring emails for users, writing code, summarizing articles, finding general patterns in text)

Also, when people talk about ""it can't reach AGI"", I clearly have no idea what they mean. Because large language models are already generally intelligent. Am I missing something? What person can:

- Speak in English, then french, then chinese?  
- Code a basic React project in a few minutes? Not an extremely sophisticated one, but a simple, working one?  
- Knows a little bit of nearly every single programming knowledge in the world

"It doesn't ""know"" any of those things, because there is no thought and no reasoning in the model. It is very good at outputting the same words that someone intelligent would write, but it's just statistical correlation.

It's impressive until you look closer, partially because humans read charitably and try to interpret the meaning behind writing which leads us to credit it with more understanding than it actually has. But there are lots of little cracks once you look deeper which show that it clearly isn't reasoning.

As a simple example, ask it to count the number of words in a paragraph. Or write a paragraph with a certain number of words. Occasionally it will get it right on accident, but none of the models can do this consistently (and most consistently get it wrong), because it isn't reasoning.

"Whats weird, now that I'm thinking about it, is that I was pretty skeptical when it first became popular and have mostly remained that way since. I love telling people its overhyped, lol. But somehow along the way I've been using it more and more for a ton of different things I do both for work and just for fun.

Like I have zero experience coding, as in I really, really, don't know how to code. But using the gpt models over the past few months I've coded a bunch of stuff. I've created a scheduling app for my work, I've built an android app that listens to business meetings and instantly spits out a professional bullet point summary of the meeting afterwards, I've scraped some subreddits and have done all kinds of cool python based data analysis like turning comments into embedded vector files and doing TSNE, PCA reduction analysis (have no clue if I'm using these words right, also don't really care, its just for fun for me) and seeing the general trends, opinions, tone, controversial topics of that subreddit and then graphing it against other subreddits to see the biggest differences in all of those things, I've made fun little computer games for my nephews, I've made bots that chat and argue back and forth with each other about whatever topics using different llms, I've made a personal email bot, I've made a bunch of different websites and designs just for fun.

Another helpful thing I use it for is to have it straight up tell me why I'm wrong. I like discussing philosophy especially philosophy of mind and consciousness and I've entered a bunch of different essays and long comments I've written over the years into llm's and have them tell me everything they think I'm getting wrong. Which tbh is super useful. It can take a lot of time to figure out whats wrong with your deepest held beliefs on your own because, after all, you wouldn't believe them if you didn't think they were good ideas. But having a chatbot who isn't a person that wants to argue or call you an idiot just straight up tell you why you're wrong and give as many resources to prove it as you want its actually pretty exciting and useful.

I don't know if any of this is groundbreaking or revolutionary to me personally but I have been using it more and more and in ways I didn't think I would just a year ago.

"As multiple people pointed out in that post, your *proposed solution itself* was almost certainly misguided (i.e. your post was an XY problem). Those ""nosy questions"" are how people provide *useful* answers.

> I'd assume, as a beginner here...

If you're a beginner, why did you argue so rudely against *experts* who were trying to provide you with advice? Why do you think you understand what a proper solution looks like?

One of the problems with ChatGPT is that, being trained on written content, it shares most of the same misunderstandings as most of the popular data analysis literature on the internet -- e.g. asking for advice on dealing with non-normality often leads to completely inappropriate suggestions, or incorrect descriptions of common non-parametric tests. Most of these things *sound* reasonable if you don't have an expert background, so the kinds of people using ChatGPT are probably not equipped to understand when it's spouting nonsense.

"MLE roles are fairly senior positions in general in part because it takes a lot to become sufficiently proficient in core competencies like cloud infrastructure, modeling, system and software design, *Ops, all while accumulating domain expertise. You'll serve a nexus for DS, DE, DA, and product.

From a non-CS background, it'll depend on what the non-CS part is since CS covers only a few of the competencies. I've observed that the folks with stats backgrounds that could pick up the CS parts had the best outcomes since that tends to be the more challenging competency to obtain.

I'm coming from engineering (Electrical), but focused on DE, *Ops, and DA because those were the most common project needs I've encountered, despite being trained for MLE positions.

For providing text descriptions for entire product bases using some table fields, image and product sheets. (This one is genuinely useful!)

For providing a chat interface to dashboards and pivot tables (on the fence on usefulness, a good dashboard is fine and pivot tables are easy, plus it can get confused).

Chatbots (these are genuinely impressive with very little effort needed). Even just a few examples or how to speak to customers and guard rails is enough to get started. Add some RAG in there and it's a FAQ chatbot too.

Retrieving information on a customer from a customer service chat or speech interaction (retrieval augmented generation), while the agent cracks on with their job without having to look everything up. Grounded in real documents and tables.

But it’s really good to know that having another master probably won’t make a huge difference - you’re right, I guess PhD is much more valued in the research industry.

Or should i contact a lower link in the change such as talent acquisition specialist.

"Eh, in my (fairly substantial by now) experience, this isn’t exactly a panacea. Discrimination involving choosing between multiple outputs is decent but simple self critique is poor and requires a lot of hand holding. I have added LLM validators w/ Instructor to my classifier and quite often the initial guess is right and the validator is wrong, or the initial guess is wrong and the validator just waves it through. This is from hundreds of dollars of gpt4 api calls that I’ve hand checked at every stage. I’d say in my hands on average LLM self validation is a slight net positive but adds a good bit to costs, so whether it’s worth it depends on constraints. It helps if you learn the kinds of mistakes the model tends to make in your task and point those out explicitly in the validator call.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjaWhnSVlOWkw5TWNzanlVLTNQUVY5X3BYLVg2SUhqdjJQWkRweEs1YU5Ja0pUc05vU0FvTk4tcUc4V3ZhNlZTNHRtS0UwOTFYb0p1akx0TE9yLVFnaXc9PQ==

"I can't stand the ""is just next word prediction"" or ""is just statistic"" line of thought.
Yes your brain then is just electric signals. 
Nobody could have predicted that just by optimizing for predicting next word you would learn basic math, problem solving, theory of mind. These LLMs are learning intelligence by reverse engineering language, and they are converging towards the most efficient way to do so. That is probably intelligence, how do we know? Because evolution converged there to.
And probably what we have discovered is that language and intelligence are strongly connected (and empathy too for example, that explaining TOM as emergent capabilities).
Because we have an intuition of the architecture that doesn't mean we know what these language model are. Nobody knows how TOM works in our minds, the same way nobody knows how it works in an LLM.

It doesn't make you look smart downplaying the potential of LLM, it makes you look like you are not understanding the potential reach.

I agree that by themselves they won't reach full AGI, because they lack a physical world representation, that may prove very hard to reverse engineer from language (although not impossible). But a mixture of models may get there, and multimodal LLMs will still be probably the main course of the AGI meal.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjU1JyT3F1LWp4VnU2TTZwWVZOekNHcTNJUTd0MlNVSDN2VWF1QVlRd21yTlA2Zzl6dVJRT2JTdUVPeWJZT19hUXZYQXRmZHZfOHBWeERHTU12UVVLamc9PQ==

"I do not believe you provided the best comparison, but I respect what you are trying to say. AI research output and competing for DS jobs are two wildly different things. As long as you are an academic (some PhD in an academic organization), there is theoretically a limitless number of publications/research projects you can produce (as long as you can secure that funding and other stuff), but not enough jobs for everyone to become a Data Scientist (regardless of overseas and/or foreign competition). The second item is that the competition aspect of the comment ALONE is not what elicits xenophobia.

I feel that I should clarify some of the points of my comment.

1. I said ""borderline xenophobic."" But for the sake of argument, let's look at a definition: ""xenophobia is the dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries"" from Oxford Languages. This definition is in line with several others from other dictionary sources. So now what makes this comment ""borderline xenophobic""? The OP unnecessarily mentioned their lack of an accent in conjunction with competition from Asia, implying superiority in communication acumen to their ""supposed competitors."" It is the combination of the two that implies that the OP sees themselves as superior to Asian Data Scientists and Data Scientists from other continents in communication skills because of their potential dislike of their accents (among potentially other items but I will not make accusations that surpass the evidence). If they didn't, why even bring up accents in the first place? Makes no sense at all to do so. Even if its not xenophobic, it is disrespectful; this violates rule one of this subreddit.
2. OP's comments were completely off topic for their goal. OP should've just asked about what Data Science jobs are highly statistically rigorous. But OP went on a weird tangent and became the subreddit's next meme.

Unrelated to my comment (you can ignore this if you want), but I do want to address this because I have seen some anti-Asian sentiment in other subreddits (and I REALLY would hate for that to start here). There has been competition from Asian nationals for IT/CompSci jobs for decades. It comes in waves. New companies become successful, they lay people off, they outsource a number of jobs, they hire foreign nationals claiming to lack native talent, newer companies emerge, etc. It is not the fault of Asian nationals who want good jobs. It is the greed of large corporations.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjTG1Xanl2d2JhMTJkWjZRVXZ2TW9DVk9ueDhSZmRKMktfNllxck5hVGhUM2hnSDlPQVJ4WXRvbnE2eEpxVWo5Z2FlSC0wMVZfSjFVckwwZlhuLWJHTlE9PQ==

"Hi everyone,

I am a 35-year-old physicist from Chile, currently living in the USA, with both a bachelor's and a PhD, who lacks confidence in applying for data science roles because I feel I don't fully grasp all the foundational concepts. I have a diploma in Python applied to Data Science, where I learned the basics of data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. I gained proficiency in libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, as well as the fundamentals of machine learning, including algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering.

I was considering enrolling in the Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) at Georgia Tech, but now that I am moving to Vienna, Austria, I am contemplating applying to the Master in Data Science program at TU Wien. I feel very confused about what to do. Do you think one master's program is better than the other?

The core courses of OMSA are interdisciplinary, covering basics such as Computing for Data Analysis, Introduction to Analytics Modeling, and Business Fundamentals for Analytics, as well as advanced topics like Data and Visual Analytics, Data Analytics in Business, and Computational Data Analysis. Additionally, students can choose four elective courses and complete a practicum.

On the other hand, the TU Wien program's foundations are structured around Fundamentals of Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics, Big Data and High Performance Computing, and Visual Analytics and Semantic Technologies. This includes courses such as Data-oriented Programming Paradigms, Experiment Design for Data Science, Statistical Computing, Advanced Methods for Regression and Classification, Machine Learning, Advanced Database Systems, Data-intensive Computing, Cognitive Foundations of Visualization, and Information Visualization. Moreover, students have the opportunity to choose electives from different areas and complete a 30 ECT thesis, along with additional credits focusing on Domain-Specific Aspects of Data Science.

The TU Wien program appears to offer a more structured approach with a focus on foundational principles, while the OMSA program provides flexibility and a broader range of elective options. In terms of cost, the OMSA program is priced at $11,000 USD, while the TU Wien program costs approximately 3,000 euros for the two years.

I think LLms will form the basis of knowledge base for AGI, we would then need model equivalents for math, creativity, vision, hearing, speech, etc. Mixture of experts and the conductor would need to be built more in order for us to get AGI.

It takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets. How long does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?

"DE would probably be a bit easier to get into than MLE (and can lead into MLE in the future), but I would recommend you follow other's advice by taking relevant electives with lots of applied CompSci. If you can afford to do so, start looking at DE internship/part-time job/full-time job requirements NOW and work your way towards being able to meet the requirements of those jobs. Finally, consider studying the material of any DE Professional Certification (check the exam preparation guides). You don't have to go and take the tests, but knowing cloud tooling in detail will greatly help you in interviews. Just pick the cloud platform you like and work from there:

But it's worth mentioning that the other commenters here were trying to point you toward the fact that there are a bunch of different models built to solve this situation using probability theory, etc., that will almost certainly work better and have fewer failure points than an ad hoc simulation. A reference point for this better class of solutions is poisson process, which might not be the right model family for you but at least gets things rolling.


It's possible that, in your situation, it isn't worthwhile to learn the ideal solution and that putting together something homemade is simply faster for you. Such is life!

"Lab sciences are very bureaucratic because being a PI then means being a lab administrator and fund raiser. I think “sciences” like stats and economics are better in that they don’t usually follow the lab model but work with data and produce empirical findings and — more crucially — produce new methodologies. My use of the word science in this post here is colloquial; it’s more of a shorthand for rigorous, mathematically sophisticated, research oriented roles which are admittedly in short supply. 

I’m an Econ PhD student who has (luckily) landed a tenure track offer (we don’t usually postdoc in Econ) but I suppose I would have taken an Uber or Lyft economist role (which are primarily research based) if I had gotten those (hiring is way down for such roles) since I wouldn’t have to move.

"Hi I have a PhD in bioengineering and currently am a postdoc in computational modeling, process engineering, at a major pharma company. My previous postdoc was centered on bioinformatics but really not rigorous enough to become an expert in the field. My thesis was centered on using ML to predict cancer drug response in cell culture. I currently have 3 first author publications in bioinformatics type journals with several additional second author publications. In the postdoc I am currently in I was really hoping to gain some solid AI experience but so far that hasn’t panned out. I have been thinking to transitioning to more DS roles but when I apply I don’t even get a screening interview. It has left me thinking about doing a DS masters but a lot of the courses and subject material, I.e statistics, R, Python, traditional machine learning (SVM, regularized regression, GPs, tree based methods, clustering etc) I’ve already been exposed to and it seems a waste of time and money. My other thought were to take a graduate certificate program specifically in AI but my free time is limited. The third option I was thinking was doing some projects I am interested in a making a webpage with tutorials but again free time is limited and I don’t necessarily have the computational resources for deep learning, Though AWS might be an option. My kind of final option is that staying at my position for the next year will give me some name recognition because I work for big pharma in a computational role and figure out how to better sell myself. I just know currently I am not getting enough satisfaction out of my job or growing enough. I like computational work and thus DS seems like a good fit. I also don’t necessarily want to stay in biotech because I would like to move back to Colorado and it seems opportunities are limited compared to the coasts. Any suggestions would be great.

"Yup the bar is only high for math/stats/physics/econ PhDs because most of the other sciences (including physics to a great extent) have been swallowed up by the lab model where papers are pumped out by massive teams rather than written by a small group of scholars. It’s not practical to kick people out for failing quals or admit only the best when you need underpaid labor to do grunt work in labs. 

Math is not strictly speaking a science but math’s influence on stats and Econ is the only reason these fields remain “rigorous”. There was a substantial effort to axiomatize both these fields in the 20th century which ensures there’s a unified core of knowledge and standards for training. Econ PhDs typically come in with background in graduate level real analysis and point set topology and so do stats PhDs, which ensures some minimum standards of quality in matriculating PhD classes",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjNmZobU56Q0IyVkx6MFRNNmpDYW9LcHhvZi1hcTJqbEY3X2xuWGNkb2FKNVVnQ2VVMGxoVWlpUW10eXZfOXJ3QlFFUVJMOHlxWXBiQjdMb3FaRF9RWWh1WGJEWHhlNzNfN1ZPOG5aM0tFVmM9

"> no, those were not useful answers.

You didn't get useful answers because you refused to provide any information, and -- as a beginner, as you say -- you didn't understand enough to know what information was important to give. That's fine, that's just part of learning. But refusing to actually engage with the people who are trying to help you solve the problem isn't going to get you anywhere.  For example, even if the curve fitting you were trying to do *was* the correct approach (which is likely wasn't), it would be impossible to recommend any specific approaches without knowing what the fit is being used for, and how it should be evaluated.

"There's really no other way to say it clearly. The whole attitude that gets someone to """"I am going to ignore this simple question and instead appoint myself to consult on and redo the entire project!"" is beyond unreasonable, arrogant, and rude. 

A simple answer would be ""mapping weibull distributions tends to handle time until X situations pretty well. Maybe you can try that. SciPy has some utilities that are built for this. I'm not sure about your use case, though, so be careful with it."" But, instead, the humans decided they wanted to answer questions like ""is this method the best way to handle this scenario?"" and ""Is mapping a curve even appropriate for this data?"" and **not** the question that was asked.

Nothing you can say is going to make discarding a request and appointing oneself to fully reexamine a problem defensible. Whereas GPT4o says ""here's a dozen methods"" (all were more or less reasonable) ""here's the package that maps them"" (yep, that was what I was looking for! thanks! And it exists and does the thing.) ""here's the resulting curve over a histogram for visual reference"" ""here's a couple ways to test fitness"" (after research, all were correct and valid ways of evaluating fitness for this task).

">  The humans just didn't know.

It's ridiculous to claim that no one in a thread full of data scientists knows how to structure a simulation. If *everyone* is asking for more information, you didn't provide enough. This is exactly why ChatGPT is dangerous as a knowledge source -- evaluating its output requires enough expertise to do some basic fact checking, and enough to formulate the question properly to begin with; and this is exactly where the difficulty lies when you're a beginner. Most of the work in consulting is just trying to get the client to formulate the question properly to begin with, and it's extremely common for people to ask for advice about how to implement the model *they think the need to implement* instead of explaining the actual problem they're trying to solve. Your question was a perfect example of this problem, since even if some kind of curve fitting approach was reasonable, it would be impossible to actually *select* a procedure without more information about the specific problem. So it is *flatly impossible* that ChatGPT provided a reasonable answer unless you provided it with more information than you provided in your post, and it would be impossible to *evaluate* its answer unless you already knew enough about these procedures to understand when and how they should be used.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjQlJ0MjBRcHMySk5lNVhBM25sSThJOVZMd1FZQ213LTI1WDY0c0N2alJIcndDc0VPYy13Ny0tbngzNHJnMEh3Sml2SUh0UEF5Z1hlWXYxOVBvRFpkOVE9PQ==

"This interested me too. So I looked around. Don’t know if this is what you’re looking for but I guess the intuition is this. When the values of beta are small, the coefficients approximately match the percentage change in the dependent variable. 

To see this, take ln(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1•X + some error. Now for a small change in X ( del(X) ), it can be seen that ln(Y_new/Y_old) = beta_1•del(X). Suppose the change in X is 1 unit, then e^{Y_new/Y_old} = e^beta_1.

For beta_1 = 0.04, Y_new/Y_old is approximately 1.04. You can see how it’s useful in a percentage change sense.

For higher values of beta_1, I see that the approximation doesn’t hold. This can be attributed to the Taylor expansion of e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + …
For small values of x, the higher order terms can be ignored. Not so much when x is large.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZENNUVo0MWVYS3Z0X28wbHB0ellNbXBsM0U2MnQtS3J5RTBxTVppdXlRZlY3cVk0aTFvQzh0Ti13aDN4aFF4aXNaa1VSMWVBdk9GMDZSZGdVNXEybXc9PQ==
"The coefficient estimates in a log-level model (logged outcome, untransformed regressors) have (approximately) a percent interpretation. For example, a coefficient estimate of 0.1 can be interpreted as a one unit change in X is associated with a 10 percent increase in Y. This only holds for small coefficient estimates.

"Think about self driving cars. They can never learn to drive cars like humans, if they are trained by just looking through lidars and cameras. Because driving a car requires general intelligence. A large language model has a model of the world, that it has learned through words. But it is a model of the world no less. The model clearly understands things, and while some people say it is just predicting what to say next, I would argue that this is also what humans do. We predict what our next action should be, and this prediction is expressed through voice or muscles.

A large language model can understand a picture, because it can relate stuff that it sees in the picture through a generalized understanding of the world. So a large language model would be my best bet at building a truly good self driving car. It will be able to achieve human level evaluation of the obstacles it sees on the road, even if what it sees is a monkey riding a bike with an old grandmother chasing it with her purse up high.

The main difference between llm an humans, is actually in my opinion that we have access to its thought process. It's first though must be correct, or we will consider it dumb.

"These are good points. To be a little more clear on my problem, I’m working with a recruitment firm that hires senior executives for client companies, and they have a lot of data from searches where they have recruited people to different companies and have a large dataset of pretty much all senior executives within a couple functions. In each of these roles there are large, intentional efforts to find women, trans, non-binary and underrepresented minority groups which will help somewhat with the bias, but you are right that that will not help much  with the industry-wide / systemic bias toward majority-representative candidates. 

The goal is not to replace the “off the page” factors, but to give recruiters a good head start by recommending candidates that have a high probability of getting the job, and relevant searches from the past that will have similar candidates.

"Scoping:

- Is this a screening tool? I.e.,  callback y/n
- Is this a full candidate pipeline tool?

Define what problem you're solving. Recruitment is a multistage process that used hard and soft data to arrive at a decision. Understanding where your solution fits in will help you. Without knowing this, the suggestions I make are very general. 

Also, get some domain knowledge on this stuff. What sort of tools are used? What do they say about a candidate? 

I'd also check for biases by looking at gender/age and seeing if they have any correlations in the existing data to any key selection criteria. You may want to look into methods to limit their influence on the target. This stage of the journey can also yield some insight for your firm on what they can do to start addressing biases. 

I'd also want to do some rigorous feature selection to see if there is maybe too much data being collected that's redundant to simplify the model and provide insight on potentially saving money in recruitment. 

General ideas for models would be logit regression potentially with ordinal outcomes if multistage. Perhaps even elastic net

"# Career Transition from Defense Industry to Data Science

I currently work in the defense industry, specializing in C++ and Matlab, and I am 25 years old. I plan to pursue an M.Sc. in data science through machine learning (ML), as I am passionate about this field. My thesis project will focus on time series data modeling and prediction, which has always intrigued me.

I am determined to build a career in data science and analysis. Can anyone provide a roadmap for transitioning into these fields?

I am especially interested in strategies for keeping up with the rapidly evolving information in data science, which is quite different from the more static technological environment of the defense sector due to safety and policy restrictions.

My issue is not money, as I am paid very well in the defense industry. My passion lies in data science prediction models and related areas.

"Anyone who has a background in a field that deals with exponential growth (eg, finance, econ, ecology, etc) is likely to at least sorta remember `e` and logarithms. Worst comes to worst, you have a plot of `log(1:100)` in your Appendix you can flip to. Most anyone can see the shape and get the intuition behind the transformation.

I regularly need to communicate about ""small counts"" models (Poisson / negative binomial models) -- including hurdle models -- and stakeholders in our marketing department don't have too much trouble getting why things aren't quite as simple as a vanilla linear model. 

I'm not afraid to have a ""stats slide"" up front (with a playful ""you can do it!"" or ""hang in there, kitty!""), as long as you play it fun and they trust you're trying to communicate intuition for them and not hit them over the head with complexity for no reason. This takes balancing the tone with the content, and only if you really think it's necessary to anticipate questions or concerns.

Usually, though, you can get away with skipping discussion of the functional form altogether, after a brief stop on ""inputs"" (as appropriate).

>intepretation of those coefficients easy to explain to stakeholders? I

That's really the whole ball game -- **know your audience**. Frameworks like `marginaleffects` are useful, and in the super generic case of describing the coef on a logged variable ""% change"" is usually good enough.

"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently building a model that aims to predict a KPI based on a set of control factors (in-house company data) as well as psychometric data (personality, logical ability etc.. the type of tests you see in many recruitment processes nowadays). 

Unfortunately, we do not have much data to work with, around 50-60 observations in total. This is further complicated by the fact that our total available predictors are around 30. 

I am not from a data scientist background, my background lies in psychology / statistics. With that said, I am unsure what type of model is best to fit this task. Which type of model would produce the most accurate estimates while still allowing for an explanation of the results. 

What I mean by that is that apart from predicting the outcome variable, we're also trying to explain the relationship that the different predictors have with the outcome variable. For example, let's say a personality trait like openness is used in the model, then we would like to be able to explain that this predictor displays a concave downward relationship or a strictly positive relationship with the outcome and that being within x and y score on this trait is desirable. 

I am looking for any guidance and learning resources on how to approach the task, which model would be best suited given the conditions and restrains of the data (50-60 observations) and how could we best approach feature reduction.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkWUxOLU54OG54YW95TGphWU5lWFNyQ2pzbndFVS1pLWM4NmQ5UFZkSXlmZUFqcVpFWXdUajVaTkNOSDYwZ2ttaklwVFBJUTVUZ2p3LUlGcFF3RWNLbEE9PQ==

I love this aspect of my job but hate my current work situation. I would like to branch out into something less geoscience- and more visualization/data-related. 

My question is: what should I try to learn to become employable?

I can't really code (yet). I am currently doing the Data Science: Analytics course through codecademy. Is this enough? 

What do you folks recommend? Is learning a bit of SQL and Python enough? How do I get better at it? Why, oh why, didn't I take any coding classes in school???",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNVlMMjAxT1djdkNOZGF3MG5DODd0cDktU2J4bVBSVUZNdXYyaGxLalh2akVsUzRLQmJfbTl1MG9nSGJQNlFJQm1mbTZLZXdYUnZsd3hSZlJINmlfbHc9PQ==

You should focus on learning the math first and how to communicate second. Soft skills are super important, but they can be learned on the job. 

I personally don’t communicate all the math. It’s in my white papers and appendixes, but I won’t ever put it in a deck.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYWJiVUxKeGJoQU1kSFlOVURINVhLdmlNN29hdERyMHZiNVFEZ1FxSElfWmpyU2Q2cjNIVkEydlowaEM4cE1JYkJ5bnBTbkpJZTczanFmdFhHdWRKYnc9PQ==

"#College student in medical program want to transition into Data Science degree.

About me: i'm first year in medical degree and i got an offer to Data science program (in another country). It also come with tuition grant with 3 years work agreement which i see as an opportunity to build up my portfolio with work experience. I have done some side project on web development with help of senior in the college and i start to liking it.

#the question i would like to ask is
if i want to break into job on data science field. Should i stick to medical degree and take online data science courses. [pro. I will have a very stable degree to get an employment in case i failed landing on ds job. and medical degree might give a lot of credit for easier job finding]
Or
I dropped from medical college and move to data science degree, take my 3 year work agreement after grad, build a good portfolio and try to land a job. [pro. This is a straightforward path to career in ds. I will need less time compared to 6 years medical program and less stress. I will also got into ds community]

main point of concern: importance and efficiency of DS program AND Comparison of 2 choice i mentioned.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkLTBBTkZuajdqcUNxeXJlS1lKcF9PZWljZzdZQkVTLWJveHE0U01xR3BDbzVwOHoxU05YdzJWZUNWcEM3bmpTa2Z0c1REOTNOUnNGcElmUDZaNG5PSGc9PQ==

How to explain this to stakeholders?  People who understand something in mathematics do not ask stupid questions, so we can simply say that this is how mathematics works.  If we go into details, we can, of course, say that minimizing the mean square error is equivalent to the maximum likelihood principle, if normally distributed errors are assumed, something about the Gauss-Markov conditions, after that explain for a long time what the maximum likelihood principle is, and so on  Further.

Edit:

As you probably know, bayesian inference is used over frequentist (regular statistics) and is very model dependent. You have things like BIC or AIC to try to choose which parameters or model best matches your data.

For example, let’s say I take a scan of your lungs. There will be some kind of signal that is some standard deviation over the background.

Now lets say you have some infection in your lungs that we can see, and it has some shape. But its all over your lungs and maybe its because you are a smoker and its scar tissue. I can either say that’s an unimportant random event or having knowledge of how lung infections spread I can say that it is pneumonia.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkQUZmbWtyQVU1cDF4dHRfTEdEYkk4dS1NcncwRVMyUXIzNGVlRG4yeVdGMHB2bVdUMFN6aVFJclNGMWtUWGRKVlpGTlJHb2Z2akROOXR1Yjc0dDRNTlE9PQ==

Indeed now additionally engineers must know to communicate with who pays for such a system, scientists with who uses it.

First of all, super happy that I found this subreddit, literally already feel excited about what could come next.

"A bit older than a lot on this subreddit so some techs may seem outdated:

Joined the military out of high school but was injured during my first contract.

Was planning on studying engineering but a smaller school provided a full ride scholarship between academics and partial GI Bill so I ended up attending there. 

Studied economics and mathematics. I had a really good advisor that highlighted the need for extra mathematics to be competitive for analyst roles and graduate school. Interned more on the quality control/operations side between years 1/2 and 2/3. Interned as a quantitative business analyst intern my third year. However, due to a curriculum change I was able to graduate after my third year.

I applied to grad schools with a focus more on statistics as data science was starting to get its big push. I lucked out with my mathematics department being heavily tied to the computer science department so I had taken some programming classes along with the mathematics theory. My econometrics courses were also taught in SAS which at the time was still seen as a good skill. 

I got into my first choice grad school with hovers inside the top 20 graduate statistics programs. The degree was an applied statistics program that eventually became a MSDS program. My graduate program required a practicum so I got to tack on another internship like experience.  Applying in the fall and spring I was able to land a role as a data scientist at a big tech company straight from grad school.

"Hi Guys,
I have 15+ years of experience , can be classified as Supplychain. Up to VP level, my last 4 years have had been self employed as consultant and as I love data  and math in general ,  a friend of mine was considering career change to data analytics and they did one of the expensive boot camps , while I studied by myself and I got to a really good intermediate level with SQL while  also learned R - beginner level- Phyton beginner level( now I have started to focus my study to Phyton )

I want to pivot to the world of data however I am also worried my higher level kind of makes it challenging to get through the barriers - I am willing to take some salary cut - recruiters/hiring managers looking at it as risk?
I have great people skills , after all the years great understanding what is required for a supply chain and how to assess the data and prepare presentations etc 
I also thought about product management courses - because I have managed non technology related products entire career- costing, timelines , managing several parties, aligning them are very easy for me
What level of positions do you think best to approach , should I do a masters just so that the Technology companies look at my resume more favorably? 
Any suggestions would be highly appreciated , thank you

"Thank for the response. I like data science more.  But transitioning to other degree means that i have to give up my medical program which has very stable career prospects in my country and moving abroad is a look really challenging for me. I would greatly appreciate expert opinions on whether the data science degree at NTU singapore is worth it or not.

in conclusion my choice are 
1)Going all in and goes study in Data science 

pro:
-I like it

-I get connection (hopefully)

-I get out of my comfort zone 

-I can try to drop the medical program i'm studying. in case thing wont goes well i can return (if possible)

con:
-I have to go abroad and live alone (it sound fun but also scary)

-if thing don't goes well (college life/job prospects) i might regret giving up a highly sought after degree for a delusional dream of working as data scientist.

2)I continue my 6 year medical program, try to do side projects and attend online course. even if i didn't land a job I can still work as a doctor.

Pro:-career path is very straightforward and stable

Con:
-trying to catch two bird is very tiring and working as doctor is known for being restless and having less freedom.

"Anything truly SOTA done under the guise of a financial institution is NOT going to be broadcast on a public Internet forum. 

At a high level, I can tell you model tuning for fraud detection at scale will likely lead to marginal improvement. 

Odds are there is far more value to a bottom line in improving data / business intelligence, optimizing governance processes,  and improving feature engineering. 

[*Outside of research work] I would propose prioritizing processes like the above over spending significant time trying to tune a model. Based just on the context provided, I would recommend building a model in a framework like xgboost near the end stages of the project. It should take up a far smaller portion of time compared to governance, feature engineering, and improving intelligence. 

Big picture, at the end of the day your goal should be to have something to show non-technical folks like finance as it relates to bottom line. If you say you spent a month working on technical development to generate a 1% improvement in model accuracy, it’s going to come across as an inefficient use of company resources. 

Think of what you want an ideal outcome of the project to be when deciding how to prioritize your time. Think from the perspective of non-technical folks. 

A perfect outcome in the future could be walking in and saying “I made these governance processes 150% faster by automating the ETL process over the past month. This has increased our detection rate by x% and decreased data error rates by validating our ETL procedures”. 

Or, “I identified the following data sources as noise and removed them from the model. This led to an improvement in accuracy of _% and decreased our cost of resources by $_.” 

Or, “I met with the _ department, and we identified the following data sources as relevant. They are now included in the model leading to higher accuracy rates”. 

Sorry to go on a tangent, but these are the kinds of things you should be thinking about if you’d like to be considered a high achiever, high impact employee at your organization. This kind of mindset will get you noticed, especially by non-technical management, while focusing all of your time and energy on marginally improving model performance will likely be considered an inefficient use of time.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkNld6aGpia3JnX193anV6Z0JEbmhlNUQ0YWFqWmIwOE9CQjFhaUhWTFpBT09pNFU2TGh4ekhibDI1VjhDc3ZNOUFfeFlvVzIzTUpqenpyY3lvcnN6YVE9PQ==

"As a general rule, Bayesian approaches are useful for modelling ""small data"", high value problems. E.g. the probability of a loan default or insurance claim, where these events don't happen very often, but they are very costly, so it's important to estimate the probability accurately. The second reason to use them is when you have prior knowledge that you want to incorporate into the model. In the case of these two examples, if you are just opening a new loan book or insurance line, you might estimate the likelihood of default/claims using a prior distribution crowdsourced from industry experts. This allows you to start doing business with no default/claim history, and to learn as you gain experience through these events.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkaE4xendwR1hlSGRKMGlfb1lfdmtaSDR5bnhOMDlVLWtyci0zZlhaX21Ha2RRY2o0QXBZVE9FblV1SjhBbklUZnUzRHc4ajlfT0ZDd2s1Qk1nb2F3Q0NveTFCNTU5cFdWdGctMUp4MklJMEk9

- Just apply more. 2/100 is a decent hit rate for interviews

"Hey guys, I'm a doctor in the UK and currently working 3 years post grad. The pathway to becoming a doctor in the UK is an undergraduate degree (MBBS).

After spending around 8 years in the medical field, especially in this current environment, I'm desperate to leave clinical medicine. My only passion has been tech and programming; however, due to family pressure, I ended up in medicine.

I currently have a couple offers for a Msc in Health Data Science. My main question is trying to choose between UCL and LSHTM. The thesis for LSHTM is a summer project which the school states ""The project will typically involve identifying appropriate data to tackle a particular research question, extracting and cleaning the data, analysing the data and creating suitable visualisations of the results. Students will describe the whole project in a detailed written report."".

Whereas, for UCL, the model for the dissertation is a journal article, where an independent research project is researched and written under the supervision of a member of academic staff.

I feel like the former is more employable with evidence of a project and possible networking. However, UCL offers a bit more courses that I'm interested in and is a more prestigious school.

I appreciate any insight that you guys provide! I'm currently learning python, relearning calculus, linear algebra and statistics to prepare...",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeXl1MkcxYTd6MnVUc2J6cnFVckFxNXRHSzcwblJwbDNLbUU0RU9xVnA4alFjNEhmSDhqTW5PdnVsNG9UR0s0SE9SQlZOQUQ2eXkzRGxBeHNyTWU0RV9BSHYtOEY2OEE5OU5mZVVrODhTRGc9

"Data science, analytics, data engineering and business intelligence are in a weird space right now. Job titles are WILDLY misleading and there's a ton of overlap between what jobs do at different companies in different industries (and even within the same companies sometimes). Make sure you're searching for all those job titles and looking at the job descriptions and the responsibilities to make sure you're looking at the right jobs. 

Have you reached out to a recruiter who works in the space? Or to any of the companies you're interested in working with directly? That can be a viable longer term approach as well. I'd work through your network, through your alumni association from your masters degree.

"Just curious as someone who recently is unemployed what rates are you looking at? Are you only looking for positions with ml or have you thought about ones that might be less appealing? Are you only targeting remote roles. 

I would say reach out to network that's where you can find the most opportunity and ease of getting through even if resume is bad. I would recommend being open to go in office even if not preference. Main places hybrid are big banks. With recruiters try different ones and the best is if you have any friends who are recruiters. The best is if you can get someone from bigger chain in local office. Then they may have inside scoop on how to sell you what opportunities fit. They may also have repor with hiring manager and can more likely get you on short list. 

I do know though for instance some of the positions I'm looking at the range midpoint is below my salary but I'm still going to try and get around my old salary 126k but if I can't then I might jump on it. I know too lots of places locally like to do contract then open to converting to full time. On those rates I'm looking at is a bit lower at like 60 an hr.

"(Bad: The best roles would be actuarial if not analyst, Ds, or ml. But they require exams you most likely don’t have. I’d focus on cost cutting now to extend the runway you have, lower your burn rate to last longer.

(Better:) I’d also look at startups. Look at venture capital companies and look at their portfolio and apply to any job. Use a OCR template, use a lot of the lingo of each job description in some of your bullet points.

(Solid advice regardless:) Don’t be complacent thinking your resume is good. It sounds like you got pushed past the ocr with your friend, and maybe the gov didn’t even use one, but a default fill-in-everything application. Make a google doc basic bullet point resume.

Get LI premium, search for job title, use the actively hiring filter (only available in Premium), go to the profiles to see if they recently posted any openings, then reach with 2/3 lines of msg summarizing why you're a good fit.

"You’re presenting this? If so, all of those words should be things you say and not things written in the dashboard. I previously was in a role that was similar to what you describe and some key rules are a) if you have to write a paragraph to describe what is being shown, the visualization is not good, and b) never put a bunch of text and instead explain it to your audience. Visualizations are an aid for you to tell a story. The story should not be on the slide (and this type of text should never be in a dashboard). 

My own preference would be to also divide the information up, either in a slide deck or across different sheets.

ETA: and just for knowledge, the main use case for dashboards is to view metrics/trends that might change over time, with data that automatically updated. As such, the story you tell today might be different from the story you tell two weeks from now.

"You should look into the services that scan your resume for keywords and compare it to job postings.

I had a service help me redo my resume and the way they did it felt awful and made me cringe but I started getting at least 2 or maybe 4 times as many responses as I was getting before that. Like I think the game is just changed and you basically have to do a sort of seo on your resume or its not even worth applying.

Edit: Additionally I've found applications are mostly meaningless with all the job post finding services because every post will have 1000 applicants in like 2 days.

I have a Mathematics background in academics and just started learning python. I want suggestions from you guys to know if this is the right path to follow or I can add/ delete something from it.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkYUNpeGItUzJMNk1RUFMxUGFTbWwwUmxSQ0pScWJ6ZFhMS2puMFc3MEhIYm5MZkczaXlOempYbXZKVGROdThuQzNyNFJSMEQxcV83UE5DNXJhZmQwQlE9PQ==
"I’ve had multiple people in DA/DS roles review my resume and tell me it looks great. I have master’s in DS plus a year of research experience where I led analyses involving machine learning approaches and using Bayesian inference, multilevel regression, and probabilistic simulations. (I even built a Dockerized Python package application around the probabilistic simulation, complete with unit testing and CI/CD through GitHub actions.) This led to multiple papers published in top academic journals for my friend. 

I also have a year and a half experience as a data analyst now, and I do freelance consulting building ML and stats models for a small corporation. 

I haven’t landed a single interview for a DS role in the last thousand applications I’ve put in. Granted, most of them were low effort easy applies on LinkedIn, but I’ve put solid effort into a lot of them, and even to places where a friend referred me and sung my praises. And still not one single interview. 

I’m pretty comfortable saying it’s the market that’s the problem and not our resumes.

EDIT: wanted to add actual advice, though take it with a grain of salt. I’m using the fact that I can’t gain traction in DS and the fact that I’m at least employed as a DA/freelancer to pursue side hustles based around unrelated interests. For example, I’m booking paid photography and videography gigs, as well as paid music gigs. I’m also considering teaching salsa dancing here and there. 

I got into DS for purely practical reasons (I can learn pretty much anything fairly quickly, and the market seemed so great when I started), and if I knew it would also be this hard to make the type of money I aim to make, I probably would’ve pursued talents I’m actually passionate about. (I’d rather struggle to make it as an artist to be honest.) So don’t be afraid to explore any other passions you have and see where it lands.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSjhyWmcxT0ZlZTN5b05tUDZTaG1scXJKQ1ZzclRSYVUwZ2ltY1pnT3pick9EZDJ3VHNhM2J4VUZyX0VyRUJKVms1VDJqNUducS1zYWxKakR1alQySEhTLXZZN3JURTRCOExJcXRqSVJkVFk9
"I have been trying since January of this year and finally got some offers. I only have 4.5 yoe you can do it! I keyword loaded my resume. I scraped LinkedIn for positions that I wanted and I did a word cloud to look for common keywords. I noticed some I didn’t put in my resume even though I had a synonym in my resume and I increased cold calls that week I uploaded the update to job boards. It took a bit after that to get an offer but it happened. It will just take some time. 

I didn’t lie about any experience I just made sure I had multiple versions of certain skills to match what people were looking for. You may also want to look at resumes of people recently hired to see if they have some keywords your resume doesn’t. 

Example of some keywords instead of just extract transform load ALSO put ETL or ELT.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkeFR4eldobjNQdUhHc2lCbGtKdEVoREtrRDM3d1AyZFhzOVhCTWYxMXVQVjVOZVNUUkFBT05YT2I2Q1RxcEFBVnF0R01BSmZxSUV1c25tMzZkcm9YRHc9PQ==

Ironhack's AI School offers courses that could give you an edge. These courses are designed to simplify complex data analysis with AI, which is a highly sought-after skill. By enhancing your skill set with AI knowledge, you might find more opportunities opening up in both data analysis and data science roles.

Check out Ironhack's AI courses to see how they can help you boost your career: [Make Complex Data Analysis Simple with AI](https://lp.ironhack.com/ai-school/make-complex-data-analysis-simple-with-ai).

In the meantime, while you're learning and upgrading your skills, you could explore short-term roles that are somewhat related to your field or those that leverage your analytical skills in different ways. IT help desk roles, for example, might not be your ultimate goal, but they can keep you in the tech field and possibly lead to better opportunities later on.

"I'm sure this will start some sort of semi-religious (pun intended) debate. Former truck driver here (about 10 years exp), before a career move to IT a couple of decades ago. DO NOT leave the IT industry entirely, and especially to drive truck. It's a horrible job, and you probably wouldn't last (nothing personal - see turnover rate in the industry), but that's another conversation.  

In short, even a crap job within IT will look better on the resume than one with zero relation to the field. Besides, it's a lot easier to add fluff on your resume to an IT job than trying to explain how spending 12 hours / day behind a wheel enhanced your IT skills. Think ahead to your next interview. As you're discussing past experience, are you spinning it in a positive light (any IT), or apologizing for it (truck driving etc).

"That depends on the company culture. Certifications can be good for your career plan to satisfy internal HR development plans, that is. Also, as a manager, they can be a good means to send all of your team members to a training to justify building up a new skill within the entire team. There's some pressure then for everyone to really do the training. Beyond that I don't think managers or HR are very much interested in your certifications, to be honest.

But it also depends a bit on your age, seniority, field etc. If you are very young and fresh from university, having a certificate could show you are keen to learn something new. It's a small plus, but not a huge one. Also, if you attempt to enter a new field, then yes, I would suggest you do some certifications there to show you're being serious.

Consulting agencies esp. smaller boutique ones historically could be a good bail out option, but I’m guessing those companies aren’t in a great spot rn.

"I keep bringing this up because I'm now old enough to have lived through several of these.

The issue with new technologies is that you *always* get to a stage where a technical person says ""this *could* revolutionze *some things*"", and a marketing/sales/product person translates that into ""this *will* revolutionize *everything"".*

Big data in the early 2010s - some companies and researchers showed up to the table with specific applications where the ability to harness granular data at scale via the combination of parallell architectures and parallellizable methods made a huge difference over the status quo (aggregation of data, classical methods). 

Here's something I hadn't quite processed: the ""big data"" revolution that got hyped in 2010 and had ""died"" by 2015... we're living in it now. All of those things that were promised to be a huge deal - we take it for granted now, but being able to spin up a kubernetes cluster to run inference on whatever you want as fast as you want it? That's it, that's what big data was supposed to be. 

And here's the thing: it didn't revolutionize *everything*. But it did revolutionize some things. 

The same is true with LLMs right now - the issue is that non-technical people are very impressed by what it *can* do, and as a result all of the people who are selling LLM based solutions are feeding into that - every GenAI startup is crowing about all the things that LLM can do (and sometimes lying about it), which leads executives to believe that LLMs - because they sound like a person - can do *everything*. 

This has actually more and more become one of my big pet peeves with executives as of recently: it's become extremely obvious to me that a lot of them take on the attitude of ""my job is to have cool ideas, your job is to make it happen"".

Which is fine and dandy when you're talking about things that just require *work*. It is not ok when you're talking about things that require research. 

And that's what's happening with LLMs. LLMs are great for some things - like, beyond incredible for some applications. And smart companies with educated executives know to triple down on using LLMs for the things they're good at.

Dumb companies with non-educated executives are trying to solve every problem with LLMs. And that's where the hype is - the perspective from some executives that because they think it sounds good, that it will work AND make them/save them a ton of money.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbElRQnc3LUNvZ1dPOGJoV3ctbmpsNng5OWdEQ2t5aEVHai1fS0lJZ1otLUF0bW9zV0hzX0pFWjdYbGhPZE1YV1d1S1JnaTRFWUFZMVVBa3BHZjkzNWc9PQ==

">Data scientists don’t really seem to be scientists

I agree with this, and even the people that are doing research in data science are not often doing actual ""science"" research as muchs they're doing engineering research. Source: am (traditional) engineering PhD. 

Data scientists are business employees, not academics. And everything else in your post seems to be missing that. 

>Everyone on this sub downplays the importance of math and rigorous coursework, as do recruiters, 

People downplay the importance of math and rigorous coursework *past a certain point*. That is, if you want to focus on getting the most out your career - any career - then there's a balance of skillsets that you need to bring to the table. The reason we emphasize this a lot in data science is because there are a TON of people with strong technical skills and comparably very few people with strong ""everything else"" skills. 

It's not that we're saying ""hey, don't even bother with learning statistics"". What we're saying is that most people reach a point of technical skillset where the incremental value on becoming technical stronger has a lower ROI than becoming stronger everywhere else. And that's partly because it becomes so much harder to keep becoming more technical, and partly because it's sooooo much easier to just learn the bare minimum of soft skills to become well-rounded enough.

That doesn't mean that there is no value in becoming more technical - many people do. It's just that the share of people for whom that equation is ROI positive is much smaller - it's basically limited to the people who are both technically brilliant and also beyond limited in their soft skills. Which, again, especially with the incidence of neurodivergence in STEM fields, is not *that* rare, but it's going to be a smaller share of professionals.

As to what recruiters/hiring managers are looking for: we want people who can both do the necessary technical work while also functioning in a work environment that is comprised of and led by people. Which means you need to know/learn how to deal with people productively. That's pretty much it.

>and the only thing that matters is work experience

If you took a lot of rigorous classes, and did a lot of great research *and you can't translate that into workplace productivity*, then yeah - you're not a good candidate. 

This is like a RB running a 4.35 at the combine and then averaging 2.3 yards in the NFL. I don't care what you did in a lab - I care what you do in the job that I'm hiring you to do. Again - data scientists are business employees, not scientists.

>I do wonder when datascience will be completely inundated with MBAs then, who have soft skills in spades and **can probably learn the basic technical skills on their own anyway.** 

Again, you are mistaking ""limited value beyond a baseline"" with ""zero value"". 

I forgot more math in one summer than an MBA grad will have known in their entire lives. And I'm not an extremely technical person these days. I have worked with a bunch of MBA grads in my 10 years in industry. Some of them are extremely smart, but as it related to technical skills not only are they well below the baseline expectation you'd have of a data scientists - they also have next to none of the building blocks you'd need to learn this stuff on your own.

I learn most machine learning on my own after graduating with a PhD in OR - and that's because I had learned more statistics than I care to remember + optimization + discrete math + linear algebra. The average MBA grad will be lucky to have learned linear regression at a surface level - literally ""draw a line through these dots"" level shit. 

They don't know matrices; if they learned calculus ever, they forgot all about it by now. The general concept of programming is completely foreign to them. 

Again, I would imagine generally speaking a freshman in engineering/natural sciences/math/computer science/etc. would all already know more about the technical prereqs a data scientist would be expected to have than the average MBA grad. And I'm not talking about the technical prereqs that you see on paper - I'm talking about the prereqs that you'd need to have to actually do the average day to day job of a data scientist.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRXpWWmZkdEtoeWp3Y3lRZk42ZG1ZMHVJTm1kUWhWdXh0alllNnFDQjZ4TDhCQ3NtTnMxcHZVdFF3UHRmbEhTbUFnOWR0ZW45R3BQQVp6Vml1cGJaeGc9PQ==

"It’s not that people can’t translate rigorous classes into workplace productivity. Indeed, some of the most selective firms in finance select exactly for that and do pretty well for themselves. It’s more that people with those rigorous classes are being dismissed by DS recruiters because they are not experienced yet. This happens — unfortunately— to people who thought they were gonna enter academia but changed their mind and so couldn’t do an internship in time.

If I were a recruiter for a large DS team I’d happily give someone with As in measure theory and functional analysis from a good school an initial screen at the very least because I know how sharp such kids are and their general problem solving skills are usually top notch. Everything else can be learned on the job (conditional on passing technical interviews).

Small teams are a different matter.

"It really depends on the organisation, the hiring manager, and where you are in your career.

In my experience, certificates are largely uncorrelated with competency. Certifications indicate that you can pass exams, but exams are completely different from building things in the real world. Moreover, many of the popular certificates (AWS, Microsoft, etc.) are primarily intended to sell the company's products and tie you into their ecosystem, not to actually teach you any meaningful skills. 

For that reason, for anything past junior engineers I personally see them as a ""yellow"" flag: they don't add anything to the resume, and if the resume leans strongly on certificates then this gives the suggestion that the candidate's *actual* skills don't speak for themselves. I don't care what you've learned, I only care about what you've done with your knowledge.

For junior engineers the situation is a bit different though: juniors aren't expected to have much practical experience at all yet, and then the ""theoretical"" experience of a certificate could be a minor plus. Likewise, if you're aiming to transition to a slightly different role (e.g. SWE to DE), then certificates in the new area could also compensate for your lack of experience in the area. 

But, opinions on this differ. Anecdotally, I've found that A-tier companies and companies with a strong technology culture value certificates less than B-tier companies or companies where technology comes second. Thinking being that A-tier companies tend to focus on hiring engineers with a high level of competency (no correlation with certification), whereas consultancy/B-tier/non-tech companies tend to focus on hiring a workforce with _standardized_ skill sets, which certificates _do_ demonstrate. 

So I would tailor your resume for the job. Include if:

- It's explicitly mentioned in the job ad.
- You're on the junior end of the spectrum
- You're applying for a job where you have not much relevant real-world experience, but you do have relevant certificates.
- You have space left on your resume. 
- The company appears to value certificates (e.g. look at what existing employees have on their LinkedIn)

Exclude if:

- They're not relevant to the position you're applying for
- Including them would distract from stronger signals of competency, or would even require you to remove relevant experience. (IMO resumes should be 1 page max, including certificates almost certainly require you to drop something else)
- The company appears to not value certificates much at all
- You're senior+",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNVdHZlZaeG1pSWwyUUZsbHN3RElZSVBjU2hRd0VST3dvcjV3bnpHVHVSUWJzZUY2YnlwZUJuMlg3enhVRmxUZ1l3d3FhUnZ1SUtfczRocldzSzM4eXc9PQ==

"I was for sure lucky so I wouldn't say what worked for me is all that helpful but here's the info:

Only a bachelors in cognitive science specializing in machine learning and neural computation. Anyone with a DS or CS major would be much better off but I could at least talk about some less common things. I had to do a lot of personal learning to keep up with competitive skills though(extra stats through ISLR which now has a python version, extra programming, SQL, docker)  so hopefully that isn't the case for you!

No internships since I was working multiple restaurant jobs all summer in a beach city to pay for school.
Was in the data science club at school but I don't think that added anything.

Personal project site through github that had:

* project to determine an All NBA award prediction with explanations of choices
* project detecting the side of the body moved based on premotor brain activity and mapping it onto a 2D brain map
* DA projects using excel, pandas, and sql to do transformations and connecting them to tableau for a dashboard, as well as a superset dashboard
* use of docker just enough to show a basic understanding


If I could go back and add anything at this point it would probably be some use of cloud (probably between aws or azure depending on what you see on job postings most but doesn't matter that much). I work for government contracts and pretty much all of my work has been in government cloud tenants and I had 0 experience before getting hired.

Also anything LLM I assume is hot right now, so maybe get a version of llama working locally and use langchain to make custom embeddings for private documents and query them so you have something to show.

"Started my B.S. in Industrial Engineering

Did a supply chain internship at a small company

Next summer I did a supply chain data analytics internship at a Fortune 50 company. Did projects with SQL, Power BI, Tableau. I realized I liked data more than supply chain. I requested an analytics/DS role for the next summer

When I went back to school, I sought out opportunities to improve my code/DS skills so I started working as a software engineer at a local startup in my college town. I was ok at Python when I started but I learned more about code best practices and making things production ready. I also started doing ML research and decided to stay for my masters in IE, focusing on data analytics, optimization and ML. 

The next summer I went back to the F50 company and was placed in a data analytics role on a business facing team. Worked on Python API projects, ML, and a couple business facing dashboards. 

I continued doing ML research and focusing on statistics, theory, and programming in my masters classes

After I graduated I stayed with the same company and was offered a role as a data scientist for their digital retail team. Looking back what helped me the most throughout this was:

1) Getting domain knowledge through multiple internships at business/supply chain companies

2) Improving my hard skills (Python, SQL, R, Power BI)

">It’s not that people can’t translate rigorous classes into workplace productivity. Indeed, some of the most selective firms in finance select exactly for that and do pretty well for themselves. 

What works for finance doesn't work for every company. So yes, there are absolutely industries where pure academic rigor translates great into business result - fraud detection, high frequency trading, large scale product analytics. Really anywhere where you have engines running and where an improvement in the accuracy of a model results in immediate financial improvements, you will see a lot of value from academically rigorous people.

The problem is that most companies aren't like that. Most companies have many layers of necessary people-driven processes, and in those companies you need more than just technical skills to deliver results. 

>It’s more that people with those rigorous classes are being dismissed by DS recruiters because they are not experienced yet. This happens — unfortunately— to people who thought they were gonna enter academia but changed their mind and so couldn’t do an internship in time.

There are two reasons for this:

1. Someone who has already shown they can do the job is always going to be preferrable to someone who hasn't.

2. *A lot* of very academically capable people struggly *mightily* in corporate america. It's just a different world with very different constraints and challenges, and I've seen a lot of people who thrived in academic environments not be able to adapt.  

>If I were a recruiter for a large DS team I’d happily give someone with As in measure theory and functional analysis from a good school an initial screen at the very least because I know how sharp such kids are and their general problem solving skills are usually top notch. **Everything else can be learned on the job**

So, as someone who also got a PhD and struggled to get his first job - and who was really frustrated about it because of the same reasons you're highlighting - I immediately understood it upon entering the workforce.

Most teams that are hiring data scientists today are not large teams. They are relatively small teams that are trying to get off the ground, and because of that they don't have time to train talent. You say ""everything else can be learned on the job"", but that ignores two things:

1. You need someone to spend time doing the teaching.

2. It takes time to learn - time that person is not being productive.

If I am a Director of DS at a company with 4 data scientists who already has 2 projects that not getting worked on, I can't hire a fresh grad. I already don't have the time to spare to train someone with no work experience, I also can't afford to wait 3-6-9 months until this person is ready to start contributing. I also can't afford the risk to hire someone who ends up hating corporate life and becomes a negative force in the team (which yes, happens very often). 

Now, for larger DS teams - teams who have a range of experiences in them, and who depend on constantly building a talent pipeline in order to feed their recruiting needs - that is where you'll see hiring managers being more willing (even prefer) to hire fresh grads - because they're much more likely to be able to absorb the lack of productivity, and because taking big swings at really smart people is much more valuable.

That is why I think you'll likely see the best DS companies in the world being much more active in hiring fresh grads.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQzJKTnprZ0JlX1JYWk5zUzVZMWpoeTUyZzN5T3FEQ2Z5ai1xRmZCTHpCOUJjcEluZjFCTklackZIbE1ubTJDT0lRZnl5TTl1M213RjRJMzl3bDdaZHc9PQ==
"Personally, I feel like sharing projects that you've done at work are more helpful in an interview context. That's because, while the task is related to drawing insights, you might naturally get questions like, how did you communicate these insights? Was there resistance from certain stakeholders and how did you manage that? You want to have the interviewer believe that you'd be a natural fit at the job and that you've possibly worked on similar problems that the company does.

If you do stick to the current project, I would structure in a way where the problem is stated more clearly and the solution is broken down into sub components like stated in this article [here](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/minto-pyramid-principle-scr) i.e. the pyramid principle. If I had to take a crack at it, it would be:

Problem: How do I improve my win rate

Problem 1: Openings -> solution

Problem 2: Mid-game -> solution

Problem 3: End-game -> solution

I think this would help you craft a more coherent narrative and show that you can break down large questions into smaller solvable problems. Relatedly, I would also cut anything that's unimportant to your narrative like the home countries of your opponents.

I am currently unemployed, and my approach has been to be honest about it on my resume and cover letter and explain that it wasn't my fault. However, I haven't put open to work on my linkedin yet and I'm not sure I want to advertise that fact to the wider world right now.

Maybe it's just my experience, but the quoted part really sounds like a baseless assumption and/or personal bias. HMs shouldn't judge like that.

Lots of people are achievement-driven, they like to ""collect"" accomplishments.

"Fresher Q: is it always like this? 

HI - I'm new to Reddit and new to Data Science - so if I am doing something here I shouldn't be - please course correct. 

I left a 20+ year in communications and marketing (all channels  - tv, radio, print, digital, etc) to do data science. I am not sure I love it/like it. So I'd like to ask the community if this is what it's like everywhere, or just my experience. 

I did a DS bootcamp about 2 years ago. Landed a job as a data analyst right out of bootcamp. I've been in DA role for a little over a year. I understand (mostly) the difference between a data scientist and data analyst. I often compare it to ""doctor vs nurse"". I knew when I took this role I was an analyst. 

These are the things I struggle with and want to know ""is it like this everywhere?"":

* I mostly pull marketing data. I use a very frustrating email campaign tool to pull email audiences.  Sometimes I use SQL to pull data. 
* In my analyst role, I do hardly any modelling. I can do modelling and enjoy it! When I have brought it to attention - I often get the ""we don't need"" or ""we don't have budget"" response. 
* I do no campaign analysis - the other part of my team that does this is basically populating a spreadsheet looking at p-value. I can do so much more than this, but again, ""not my lane"". 
* I have done a few side projects that involved bigger analyses - sentiment analysis, NPS vs credit-card-holder,  but I had to initiate those myself and I often feel like I get the side-eye of ""we don't have budget for this"" or ""not interested"". Also, I haven't had the chance to see my modeling work implemented into a 'real life' situation so I can't say that my work ""created a 50% increase in email open rates"" - those quantitative facts that look good on resumes. I can make a ton of suggestions of what to do with my results but those generally seem to go no where. 
* I do a ton of lackluster reporting which involves running pre-written SQL code (now Big Query code) and literally copy and pasting outputs into another spreadsheet. There has been little interest in moving this to a dynamic dashboard environment. 

I want a role where I can use my communications skills and data modelling skills together to inform strategy, answer questions, or uncover hidden gems in the story of the data. 

Is there a specific job role out there that has a stong emphasis on the communications side of data? Are all analyst roles like this? And should I start being much more specific in job hunting looking more towards the ""scientist""/modelling side of this career path?",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlT3dUTDUyTkxmNmhGYWI5SDE5bHFfV1QtNzcyTzNXcEtCZWZtb0FMUWd1dzY5Z2F5R3QtNV9UNFBDaUdST0JFSGZlamZJMGpkVjVZcmc1WERYT0FLcnc9PQ==

Because of everyone being exposed to the mass layoffs, I don't think that's the perception now. I've hired two people that were laid off recently and I didn't consider it an issue at all.

"# A Message Through Time: Communicating with Higher Dimensions Through Experimental Analysis

**The Question Behind The Experiment:**

Is communication with higher dimensions possible?

We live in the 3rd dimension (x, y, z). We move through the 4th dimension (time). The 5th dimension and above would operate outside of time so it would make sense to communicate with higher-dimensional entities we would do so through time.

To effect this communication, I have been running a long-term experiment. Over the past 5 years, whenever a similar event has occurred in my daily life, I've noted the time and date of the occurrence. Now, with around 5,000 data points, I'd like to analyze the data for common patterns.

My aim? To turn these data points into an audio file to 'hear' any possible patterns. I've been using AI for parts of this analysis but find myself hamstrung by its limitations and my programming skills.

This is where you, my fellow Redditors, come in. I'm seeking help, input, thoughts, guidance – anything you can offer. How can I further refine this experiment? What could I do better in terms of data analysis? Are there any programming or AI experts who could lend their expertise?

Thanks in advance!

I'd actually challenge that and argue that indeed only real DS knows the math. Fake DS (like analysts wearing the DS hat) don't

"One of the crazy positives (?) of this time right now is that something like 40 percent of U.S. workers have experienced a period of unemployment at least once. It has thus become more ""normal"" and is far less stigmatized than in the past. There is a strong likelihood that at least some of the folks interviewing have themselves experienced unemployment and bring that perspective to the interview. 

That said, it is a truism that it is better to be working while interviewing, as that gives you an extra sort of leverage, in when to leave, what to apply for, what to accept. And yet, in my case, early on, it was sudden unemployment that forced me to take charge of my destiny, and I followed a very different career path as a result.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldURHNkpVaGNweGhhSEVoY1VxWGJfTng4NFFRWFB1OFZfREstS0lzZmdtQ3VrTnA1MDFmYm56dXpMbkp4MEpWblA4NjNOaUNWVHk5Ymh5TkI0SG1ZSGc9PQ==

"There’s trade offs for doing this, it’s not all upside. 

If you know the math well and specialize in it you can be a decent DS for all companies, knowing the base info.  However the downside is when this knowledge isn’t particularly useful or special in the age of abstracting away, since you’re using the same methods you just know a bit more about them. The end result is the same. Think about computers: who is hiring assembly or binary developers?

You will thrive in famine situations, when companies lack resources and have to build their own, or if someone is building a brand new product that needs to go from the lowest level and requires special nuances. These situations are not uncommon, of course, but this is where you will have an edge over normal people.

However I feel like the math is not where DS’s should specialize. Rather you should specialize in a domain of another field. You have an advantage in the industry over people who studied the math more closely(assumed finite time where you have to choose one or the other) with the intuition to even take on the product management or business analyst aspects of the job. You know what to look for, and as people who studied Bayesian, we all know choice of priors is important. Companies also love it when they don’t have to hire extra people to do parts of the job, so you’re not completely screwed in the famine section either. Your only issue is if your sector goes out of date, but as long as you pick a long-standing stable sector and are willing to learn the specifics closely you will land on your feet.   

I mean look at what the smart people are doing; they’re hiring people who already know their industry, looking for that specific industry experience. Close to the math seems a bit too generalist for a strong DS who provides tons of business value. Seems more suited for a researcher DS or MLE.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZnQ2VmRDNnNlaE1LUGdORll4N3hueTBkRnV3MG4zV3NBRFY0cHdjUzFsbWJ4c3hobTU5Y3dNdFdPZS1GTlp4d3V4YnJjY2xWR0E3S0phQ2JMeXM4QWc9PQ==

"The way I usually talk about the distinction is ""empirical"" versus ""from first principles"".

I would say a ""from first principles"" approach would be like if you fit a certain model that ""should"" be correct, or at least e.g. an engineeer or other SME tells you ""should"" describe the data. Wheras an empirical approach is more ""whatever works"".

Personally I prefer to stick to a first-principles model if I have a starting point, but that's probably my bias as a trained physicist working in still a very engineering/physicsy domain, where you can realistically predict that the thing you want to model depends on certain things in certain ways or with certain symmetries.

"If they care too much about a certification I'd view it as a red flag. It tells me they probably don't have competent people.

That being said certifications don't hurt a resume and are a minor plus. They are easy thing to point out if someone asks about your proficiency in some specific skill. ""Do you have any exposure to X? Well I did a certificate in X. ""

  
The thing to get is if your at a org with a large swat of qualified technical people (places that hire MS CS/Stats/Engineering/Econometrics/Math/Physics) that did a thesis of sorts. There is a general understanding that no one knows everything and people have different skillsets that they bring to the table.  Furthermore, if your  team is highly educated there is a general understanding that people can pick up things as they go along.

Certs are a good way to show that you have some exposure to a topic that a specific job may want even if you haven't used specific skillset in your previous role. Yes they aren't substitute for an actual project. 

As an example, lets say that you are a  data scientist with 5 years of experience and a masters degree in stats from 2018. Lets say your previous role involved mostly regression models/logistic regression projects in R or SAS  for a bank, and now your interviewing for a role where your going to be probably going building decision trees and XG boost ML models in Python for similar products at another firm.

"I think you're making a fair comparison between DS and engineers. The implication is probably the same too. The amount of deep knowledge you need depends heavily on the job/company. For most places bringing in business values is more important than possessing deep technical knowledge. That means the engineers would need to be great at designing software systems and collaboration, not being a kernel guru. The data scientists would need to be great at designing experiments, decision making and strategic thinking, not knowing how to implement xgboost from scratch.

Of course having the knowledge is an advantage, but it's not the ""goal"".

"In a way, I hate what you say because I consider it to be true. I started college in August of 2015 and graduated in May of 2019. I then went on to graduate school to try a doctorate in statistics in August 2019 but mastered out in May of 2021.

I say all this because I loved math and went on to major in it, and I was CONSTANTLY told “Bro get that math degree and you’ll be fucking set. Get yourself set up with a nice data science job and you’ll be such a hot commodity. You’ll have your pick of the litter!” The same sentiments were told to me when I went on to grad school in stats.

But when I was applying to jobs (even more so now than then), I found myself **constantly** passed over for people that maybe have a biology background and even though they maybe only took up to Calc 2 and maybe an intro stats class or two in grad school, they picked up R or Python and did some projects and talked about their grad school research, and so now they are chosen because they have specialized domain knowledge. Or maybe they minored in CS or something.

The TL;DR here is that over the last decade, there’s been a shift from hiring math people or stats people to people with CS and domain knowledge background as abstracted solutions arose and big data technologies became more popular, and so the focus shifted to computing technology knowledge + software development experience and domain knowledge.

"**Free webinar to help you build a competitive data science portfolio**

If you are an aspiring data scientist trying to break into the job market but lack enough relevant work experience, then check out this free webinar I'll be hosting on **Tuesday, June 4 at 2:30 PM EDT**  and **Wednesday, June 5 at 11:30 AM EDT** (2 dates available) where I will show you how to build a competitive Data Science portfolio that will get you noticed by hiring managers.

As a former hiring manager and Data Scientist with 6+ years of work experience, I know what you need to bridge the experience gap and show potential employers that you are ""business ready"".

During the webinar, I will answer these common questions:

* What type of projects should I include in my portfolio?
* What are hiring managers looking for?
* How many projects should I have?
* What should a finished portfolio look like?

I know how difficult the current data job market is right now, but with the right strategy, you can get the data job you desire.

I had this webinar with over 100 attendees last month and had great reviews, so I’m bringing it back with some small improvements.

Sign up [here](https://topmate.io/andres_vourakis/1001714) and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andresvourakis/) and message me if you have any questions.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJleVVNYXhrTlRST3luUjQwR2RKbzAyUVNiTktlMXNYWjlESjhKTkQ2UXM3MGhTQko4M005RGJ1YVV1ZEtoQnMyN3VvV1dGZ0hPODEzNGhLQndYdTUzeFE9PQ==

"Hello everyone,

I'm a 20-year-old in my third year of a Data Science degree, and I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed by the vast scope of things ahead of me. Here's a brief overview of my skills and experience:  
Data Analysis & Manipulation: Basic to intermediate knowledge of Numpy, Pandas, and Sklearn.  
Visualization Tools: Experience with Tableau, Power BI, and SPSS.  
Development: Some experience with Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and a bit of .NET MVC.  
I have Completed one or two projects in each of the above areas.

Given my current skill set, I'm trying to decide where to focus my efforts next. And I have the Follwing Questions:

1. Specialization: Should I deepen my knowledge in one of these areas or continue to broaden my skill set?
2. Career Roles: What specific roles in the Data Science field are available for someone with my background?
3. Next Steps: What should I prioritize learning or doing next to make myself more marketable in the job market?

Any guidance or insights would be appreciated

"Start with a project idea that you’re interested in. For example, one of my first projects was about predicting chemical properties given a set of molecules (via Graph Neural Networks) because I have an academic background in chemistry. This sort of project assumes you already know the fundamentals of coding, and you know (or are capable of learning) an ML framework like Torch. If you’re stuck, I would look to Kaggle for inspiration and general code style for creating, training, and validating an ML model. The good thing about Kaggle is that it has a vast set of ML challenges with great code.

Once you implement a model, this is where the software comes more into play. You have a model, now what can you do with it? This is a great opportunity to learn about how to optimize your code, make it available on the command line, etc. I recommend looking at Docker and Streamlit to start. Make a usable tool that others can use, and make sure it runs optimally, has logs and error handling, etc.

I’m a big advocate of “learn by building”. If you need something that’s more structured, there are a lot of tutorials out there.

"I love python because it’s great for numerical and statistical analysis and there are a lot of great libraries for that kind of stuff. I went to grad school for population genetics and it was the language  we all used. I love C++ because it’s super fast. I would avoid C, C++ is just C with objects, C isjust procedural. So I love to develop with python because you can develop really quick, you don’t have to keep compiling. you know code test, code, test, code test! I know when I have a program or script running properly then I will rewrite into C++ and hopefully be done, but sometimes there is more rewriting but development is basically over. 

Since you’re already a programmer, you don’t need to relearn about data structures, loops, or all the other stuff because all program and language says, have the same capabilities. Just a matter of syntax, so you do not have to learn the syntax, and you just need to learn to call variables. One of the online sites that I used, online books, to learn python was written by a computer science professor. Introduction to computer science use Java, which I hate anyway, she started using python because it’s a great language to learn on. You don’t have to declare variables, you don’t have to deal with, get rid of garbage. That is all the things that you’ve used that you don’t need to use anymore and you need to deal with the free up memory, python does that automatically. C++, you have to deal with that so I highly recommend C++, and I would say that the approach I described is probably the best way to use python and C++ together. Python is actually written in C so just using the python native code is super fast, when you actually have to use your own code and then call python functions and libraries that’s where it slows down. Also, you can write C or C++ programs and call them from python programs, and then write a script to integrate a bunch of programs, bunch of libraries.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlRG8ydTltUk85clRpWWxZeDNiLVJWNXRzMHdZV1l0QzNvUG80S1RFaThBelFrQTlHNEFvWEVBaUxqd2Rzb2tmWGhBalYtT2J5d293UkpROWFLaVRoTFE9PQ==

I'm a master in physics with 1.5 years of experience working at a University. I have been searching for a job in data science for months with no luck. I'm aware that I lack experience and a degree in the field, but I didn't know my physics degree would be so meaningless in the data science jobs.

I also know MATLAB and Fortran. At my job I work with large data sets (analysis, interpretation, and visualization) and I also know SQL. I would appreciate recommendations for free courses that get you a certification, but are not for beginners in coding, math and statistics.

"**Background**: I'm in my early 30s living in Japan. worked as a teacher these past 10 years and after COVID hit, things went from bad to worse in my industry. I've got a bachelor's in arts majoring in Japanese Language so i've at least gotten the language down over on my end. but I've got nothing on IT or science. I'm looking into possibly transitioning into data science at the recommendation of one of my acquaintances. He told me the pay wasn't bad and work from home was quite common.

I'd love to learn more about coding, it was very fun and interesting to learn HTML and Visual Basic back in the day and I've dipped my toes in some online tutorials on basic Python. I'm looking to invest a sizable amount of time(6months) and money to take up a course on le-wagon([https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo/data-science-course](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo/data-science-course))

I've looked up a few vids on the 'basics' of data science and i'm genuinely interested in the field. based on my surface-level understanding of it so far, it feels very much like understanding trends on much deeper levels. In terms of my personal skills, I'd say I excel at communication and presentation in both Japanese and English. 10 years of teaching in japan really helps with honing these skills

If i were to seriously dive into this field, could you please tell me what are the challenges i'd likely encounter on my way to becoming a full fledged data scientist? What type of things would HR want from me? what kind of companies should I be keeping an eye for? Would you recommend even going into this field of work in the first place? If you were still to recommend it, would you mind pointing me towards the right direction for my journey?

I would greatly appreciate any serious response to my situation. Thank you very much in advance!

"  I don’t fully understand the problem you are trying to solve. But my 0.02 from previously working on solar gen forecasting 

if you haven’t seen the pvlib python library, id recommend checking it out.

It nothing else it makes it easy to pull NWP forecast data - in your case solar irradiance as an input to  solar gen forecasts. If you don’t have any background in NWP models it might be overwhelming. But honestly, irradiance forecasting is probably the most important piece of PV gen forecasting, so it’s worth understanding. 

Depending on your forecast horizon, you prolly want to use the HRRR for short term, GFS for longer term. 

They also have functionality to convert solar gen forecasts into power generation. I think in general, this approach will do close to the best you can get for general PV generation forecasting. 

Here’s a paper that seems to have some details 

https://forecasting.energy.arizona.edu/media/papers/pvlib_fx_pvsc_43.pdf


If this sounds too in depth for what you need - I saw someone recommend a nearest neighbors type approach based on similar weather days. That’s a lot simpler and will do a decent job.  Get irradiance forecasts, find top n days in recent history with a similar profile, average PV gen for those days as your forecast.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlbFNiT1ViYjNmbVdzTC1LekY1Mi1IMTVQblhfUlp4a1NRWkltd19rQ1JWc0tNWmZicl9icVBIbllBcXI3VVQ0UDQ4Q3haTkVuZ0pNeExNbzFKX2lDc1h4bjd6aF9uWGFmRkpnS29aZllrRFE9

"Got it. Yeah, nothing you've said changes my vote that I'd take the SWE gig if I were you. If you already had that degree in Biomedical Engineering and a cool deep learning project to go with it, then it would be neat, and we'd be having a conversation about how you can use that experience to spin your resume as a good fit for a DS job. But the marginal value doesn't seem that high when you already have a DS Master's, and when the second Master's wouldn't be in one of the ""typical"" fits like CS, stats, math.

You said you wanted a DE or DS role eventually. Being a SWE is a very lateral move to DE, so having SWE experience *directly* helps there. And it indirectly helps with moving to DS, more than I expect another Master's would. And you get paid for the next year or two, instead of either having to pay or not making much money even if the new degree is free.

edit: and more succinctly, if the goal of all this is to get a job, and you have a job offer in hand... seems wise to just take it, right?

"Another commenter said it perfectly. Portfolios are an outdated extension of the way design professionals used to prove their abilities in low-information environments.

Your resume and how well it matches your answers in interviews are the overwhelming way I evaluate a candidate's past work. If it's an entry-level position and they don't have much experience, I use short tests.

For the time it takes to evaluate a portfolio or project, it's not worth it to a hiring manager. You'd have to assess is it good on multiple dimensions, is it original (and the candidate did it), etc. It takes way too long for how low your confidence in that assessment will be. Having seen hundreds of githubs packed with unaltered forks, by the book BootCamp projects, and other useless projects, I don't have any way to use anybody's ""portfolio"" to assess their abilities.

Maybe you are applying to a certain niche of businesses or something about your work history makes you hard to evaluate in a way that makes a portfolio useful. I don't know any hiring managers who are up on best practice who do this anymore.

My advice: reiterate to these potential employers that the summary on your resume and the answers you deliver in an interview will be the best representation of your work experience while respecting the ownership of those projects and their resulting IP. You would give them the same share of your attention and right to ownership/privacy of projects you worked on for them.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlcXJBdUxaN0RDeTl3ZWc1YzRGV242Wmt5VzdGRXdnLVdCcTN4ZC1SV2E5bWRmYk9oR3JfRG10SF80Wkd2NndyOEJaNVJwZ1Uxd19yRGZFQjVjQ2NvTHc9PQ==

"I totally agree! For context, these are data analyst roles requiring 2-3 years of experience, and they have the automatic application process with a place to link a portfolio.

Every other job I’ve applied to this past year at bigger companies asked for links to portfolio, that’s why I was wondering. I also didn’t get second round interviews, so I’m wondering if it’s so competitive, that HR is using portfolios to weed candidates out.

I actually prefer interviews like the one you described, because I’ve done well and received a job offer for the 3 that did call back (out of 100s). It’s just the automatic screening process at bigger companies. 

I really like my current job and manager - he has over 10 years of industry experience, and was able to tell from the interview that I had a solid foundation. It’s also a good place to learn. However, the salary is literally below poverty wages, so I might to have to look for another job when the market isn’t so crazy.

I appreciate your advice, and everyone’s advice here. I’m going to set aside a little time here and there using government or publicly available data for similar projects… one day, my resume will speak for itself! Until then, have to manage my time better and grind myself into a pulp haha.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldWxrQkNzRUJYOHROTDBSWllpWkRHZnJvdU1qR2s0SGdFXzFPUlpGVjBGTUVlU0hmT3ppdVBwSFg2d1hDZFhPcGtGTHVFMjhKNXhzV0ZjdHEzSVdHZkE9PQ==
"Yes, I plan on taking everyone’s advice and building a portfolio with public data - I was hoping to catch a break, but this is what I have to do as a result of changing careers in my 30s haha.

"This ties in to the earlier debate about whether “data science” is science or engineering. In the old days, people probably often did create their own algorithms from first principles, so they could make some claim to be doing science. However, with the development of standard Python and R packages, what most people do now is closer to engineering. While it is true that being able to do things from first principles makes a person more versatile as a data scientist, it is hard to justify the time and effort. In today’s work world, domain expertise will trump mathematical chops almost every time. As the earlier commentator suggested, whether seriously or in jest, better to invest your effort in things that will make you money going forward.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMUM2VkFpekRrbTBaRUEyVXg4QkxrckNmOS1wRTlLTmNfT05hemxuLVRTVzdVeXNkaU5xbnNGSW8zcjIxbndiSm50cTlDQzB2R2JOZk1ydEhqRldhRW41Umg0UnVoX0pvNmZaSmJnaGlfRTg9
"It all depends on how much experience you have before the break and how long the break was. And whether you actually have the skills or are just missing some skills.

You might consider applying for similar roles, getting a job, picking up skills, then moving to data analysis.

You can also look for volunteering opportunities that involve any data analysis. 

I don't think bootcamps are worth the money right now when you are doing a big transition. The market is difficult. And many bootcamps are the same money as grad degree.

"So I am in this particular situation where I am studying Bachelor's of Science of Business Administrations with an emphasis on Business Analytics and a minor in Computer Programming. This business program had me take calculus, statistics, and operations management; I enjoyed them all so decided to declare business analytics as my emphasis, which has taught me data structures, basics of AI, data analysis with R, big data, and so much more. I also completed the certificate program ""Associate Data Scientist with Python"" on my own as I wanted to improve my skills in Python. Plus, with the computer minor, I had the opportunity to learn computation and various other coding languages.

"To be honest, I haven't used Shiny in a year. However, based on my experience with it, here are the key differences from a user perspective between Shiny and Rio:

With Rio, there's no need to distinguish between frontend and backend. You create a component and specify your UI in the build method, similar to React or Flutter.

Rio embraces modern Python features such as type annotations and asynchrony. This keeps your code clean and maintainable, and enables your code editor to assist with code completions and type checking. If i remember correctly, Shiny supports asynchrony as well.

In Rio, you don’t need any decorators to make your code reactive. It continuously watches your attributes for changes and updates the UI as necessary.

In case that you are more familiar with Shiny than I am, I would appreciate it if you could give Rio a try and provide us with some feedback.

But he stands firmly on the fact that we wont be collecting any more data. Once more, why is completely beyond me. We use customer's data to build models as consultants, models require data. It is in every party's interest that more data is collected. 

So I asked him, what we should do then, given that the conclusion is more data yet the willingness to collect more data is nonexistant. He looked me straight in my face and told me that I need to do ""magic"".

"Thank you! I feel really fortunate, because my entire department was laid off the same week I got a job offer. Especially with this job market, it really was a relief.

I was applying to any entry level Data Analyst or Analytics Engineer role that seemed aligned with my experience, plus more responsibilities so that I could learn and grow.

I believe my last batch of resumes got callbacks due editing with feedback like yours - for my previous work experiences, it didn’t always quite fit into the sentence structure, so I broke my role down into these 3 components in general: 

1. Org level: Support leadership in data driven decisions with accessible reporting using Excel and Tableau dashboards 
2. Team level: Automate and streamline data / workflows using Python, SQL, etc to achieve X hours in workload reduction. Collaborate with other teams to complete X project with X impact (emphasizing my communication skills here)
3. DA role: Independently research and apply (insert statistical model) to (insert insight here)

I definitely need to go back and improve my resume with keywords that better describe what I’m already doing.

I think my resume got auto-rejected a lot because it is a nontraditional - I have a math degree from a fancy public university, but transitioned careers after teaching high school for 7 years, so I put my degree at the top, followed by most recent DA work experience, then teaching experience, and a recent personal project.

Edit: I think the personal project actually helped with my current job interview - I explained an obstacle getting the data, and how I had an “eureka” moment to get around it and answer the question for my project. It ended up being aligned with what my manager wanted as a goal for the org (I didn’t realize until recently, my manager was asking me to research topics related to the personal project lol)",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmNzhibXBIM0tSSmhyMkU4ak14VVpVWmVvWFFReUNpLWt6VWhiX1U0b3VnMVRyWTZuQVZKaDl5a0h1Y1dMSWloM3hPS3gydnVuLUlPeXZhYmR1UDVMWXc9PQ==

"As long as your language is understandable. I wouldn't worry about the accent. Everyone speaks with an accent. 

The thing you can do to instantly improve your speech. Is to pick a better pace of speech. Many techies speak way too fast, which makes their speech grating, and harder to follow, especially when you are talking about technical things. It makes you sound rushed and anxious, rather than calm and collected. 

Another is speaking from your stomach, rather than your throat. You can look it up, it is a thing singers and actors do. It gives you a fuller, often a tiny bit deeper, voice. It can be an even bigger improvement if you normally have a nasal voice (even worse than speaking from the upper throat).

"For graduate positions it depends a bit on the country. For example, in India we are looking also (but not exclusively) which university you're from. For European countries that matters less to us usually. Next, you'd need a combination of street smart and education smart to make it through the interview process. The education smart we test during the interview with standard questions. (I personally still like to ask: ""Can you overfit a multiple linear regression?""). The street smart part you could demo through some side-projects you've done (e.g. your own Git repository), or by showing that you have worked for some student club at university, or whatever. Just anything that demonstrates you have some passion for something in life.

For the interviews, many people think that they can somehow ""trick"" their way through the interview when it comes to personality by saying ""the right thing"". I have never seen that working. You cannot make yourself appear different than you are. I've seen my share of narcissists too, there are ways how to detect them with some certainty.

Also, we are interested in graduates who have the intention to stay at least for some time, and not just change one year after being hired. Depending on the country there is a tendency to job-hop and that is frustrating for an employer.

Last, but not least, if you don't make it through the interview process, don't take it too personally. Sometimes we have two or even three very good candidates, only one can be picked, and making a choice is hard. So, don't take a ""no"" immediately as an indicator of personal failure. Look at it more like a ""key-lock"" problem: it's about ""the right fit"" - whatever that mean.

Not sure what their prices are for foreigners, but it's a top university with a huge international reputation and most likely they are a lot cheaper than most unis in the USA.

Then again, you also won't get the crazy salaries you might get in Silicon Valley, but on the other hand you get a lot of other benefits in many European countries, for example some level of job security.

"# Help Needed: Clustering with Feature Selection and PCA in R

Hi everyone,

I'm a university student currently working on a clustering task using the UCI Adult dataset.

I'm looking to perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features for clustering, and I plan to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

"Yeah DS degrees are a bit knew so there’s a question about the quality of them unless you come from a recognizable school / program.

Whereas comp sci is much more established and opens up more doors. I personally have a BS/MA in Econ and it was easier to enter the job market with this background 7 years ago than it would be today.

However, getting another degree doesn’t seem to be a great idea.

Apply to more analytics and BI focused jobs and study more CS on the side (boot camp / certs / etc.). Should be able to fill in the gaps, especially with a partner who knows this stuff. Your background is really useful once you get the job, it can just be harder to get your foot in the door without internships.

"Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I came across this community and saw many of you are experienced data scientists. I’m considering pursuing a similar path and would love to get your advice.

I currently hold a Bachelor’s degree in Finance and am now working as a bi analyst. I believe that data science is the logical next step for my career. From what I’ve gathered, it seems that obtaining a master’s degree in data science is essential for advancing in this field? 

The master’s programs I’m currently interested in are:

	1.	Illinois Tech MDS
	2.	Eastern University MDS
	3.	UT Austin MSDS

Im mainly looking for affordable online programs that offer flexibility as I have 3 kids at home. Are any of these good? Do you recommend any others? 

Given your experience, could you share any insights or advice on the following:

	•	How valuable was your master’s program in your career progression?
	•	What skills or experiences should I focus on to make a successful transition to data science?
	•	Are there any specific courses or resources you would recommend?
	•	How did you navigate the job market after completing your degree?

For some context, I’m particularly interested in leveraging data science in public safety or city management roles, given my current position in a fire department.

Just keep churning out job applications and do your own side projects. Take advantage of the fact that you are in a situation where you may still have income (sounds like your husband may get a job quickly) during this time. The job market is brutal right now. Like others are saying another masters is not going to help in this situation. I would only encourage another masters if you’re truly intrinsically motivated to go back to school.,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmb3dZNFNOREJDVDFiNVJuQ1RYM0NrZ3V5R0YwNFJCX0NfS2loblk2VmxMZkY4RGxXX25WbURncFVpeE9ZbnhJeG9wM3NiRmNRdFFWX2JHT2UxeTJRT2c9PQ==
"Likely one of those it depends type of questions. Full disclosure, I have a MBA that was paid for by my current employer. I did a part time program with a big Midwest school that is good at football. Networking events tend to be pretty well attended which is a plus. I think the MBA provided a nice rounding of skills or ideas that would be hard to self study unless you are super motivated. I was also paired with a career coach which was nice to help think about where I want to go next. 

As far as DS wise, I did apply to some tech PM jobs while taking classes. Had an offer from Amazon but didn't like the onsite location. The MBA just helps to get you into the pipeline if you are looking to pivot a bit. I also get more recruiters reaching out for manager roles but I am also a lead so that may not be some much related. 

I liked my classes and learned a good bit. I also like the new network to tap into. If I had done a full time program and had to take out $100k plus in loans, I am not sure it would be worth it. I have friends who went to T10 programs and it has worked out for them as they often changed fields.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmVFhqMkJmOTlUYXdDX3UzWW01bXhlTlJJY3o2OENGeDBCTnY0SktETHJvZ2h5YktHZGlqV1NOMmYxSmZVR0gzeHBqNHVQZktoR2hIQ0RpZzhEVlE3M1RfU0VtZmtrLUs3azJlekY0WVdtM009

"I'm gonna be honest: we're jumping the shark with the whole ""soft skills are the most important thing"".

No they're not. Soft skills *are* important, they are by no means *the* most important thing. Not in data science, not in business in general.

There's this perception that e.g. marketing people only build decks, and so when you see a marketing executive present a deck, that is *all* they do. That is only a part of what they do - that is like saying ""all data scientists do is code in jupyter notebooks"". 

The most valuable thing that every person in every function does is solving problems. Marketing's main activity isn't building decks - it's finding ways to optimize spend across a range of avenues to maximize financial performance. 

Even the softest of soft areas - strategy. Strategy lives and dies with decks. But again, the problem they're solving for is not ""building a deck"" - they are solving for strategy problems, and the delivery is a deck. What is the future of our product?  How do we intend to react to changing demographics/demand for our product? What are natural extensions of our product line that minimize cannibalization and maximize synergy?",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmOGlreE1aUnYxTl9YeEZNeU45U241akhuUmt0ZmpBVkJ2QTVwbk5lWGlDTWlYY3U1cmJBY1VpSWt2TUVLYVdJN0hibHpqT2tPOFpCTm1lS3JQeF9VR0E9PQ==

"Whilst I agree with most people in their recommendation for you to get a job, and to not pursue yet another masters. I also do think that your issue may not only be due to a lack of professional experience but rather that you are desperately pursuing education as a solution to your unemployment. Here are some things you should consider:

1. Publications - Many MSc DS programmes are course based, but companies love research. The reason for this, is that it establishes you as a subject matter expert, and demonstrates your ability to fit into a R&D or more research heavy roles. Whilst it would be better to have published a few papers during your period of study, you can always publish independently.

2. Projects - Whilst in school, and after school work on projects that are captivating, personal, and most importantly each one should use a programming language or software that solidifies a set of skills (programming or statistical) that you claim to have on your resume. It would be best to display these on GitHub, and on a personal portfolio website (not necessarily at all but definitely a competitive edge)

3. Revamp Resume - Reach out to seek feedback on your resume (ie. contact a recruiter, or someone that was recently hired in your desired field of work).

4. Consider a CS Cert. or Nano degree: There are many affordable micro, nano, certifications available online (ie. edX, Coursera etc.), this can make you more well rounded and can address the skill gaps you believe you have.

5. Socialize and Network - Go to network events, reach out to alumni with similar credentials or in desired field of work.

On a final note, you might need to be a bit more introspective. Could it be possible that your husband has a done more in the areas listed above?",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmeklnX0lWMXhhTFJURHdfZTVudS0zTTZYSjFvZ0JwUm94NGV0MDQwQlo3cnpMNzVmQ3QtSGU1WVBLbm1RZDI4T2xNRUJNWV9wdUthTDNYa1k1dkszSWc9PQ==

"Where do I fit in best in the world of data? Do I fit anywhere at all, even in the broader tech landscape? Should I just give up and go live under a bridge?

For three years, I worked as a ""solutions engineer"" at an AI startup. I applied and was hired as a ""data analyst"", but I was given ""solutions engineer"" as a title instead, early on. 

The problem is (1) I'm not even really sure if there's a consistent understanding of what a ""solutions engineer"" even is in industry (and what I've found doesn't align all that well with my actual experience or career goals) and (2) that my job for the past 3 years looks almost nothing like what most people call data analysis or any other real data job. 

My job was to work directly with the company's AI framework (which was symbolic and non-statistical) and build specific solutions (e.g. computer vision, RL, multi-class classifiers, etc.) using it. I didn't make use of much of my mathematical skills or knowledge of probability and statistics (which, anyway, was never a particularly deep knowledge, as I've only taken one course in probability). What makes it even worse, is that the company was not successful. The founder hired a kid with a math bachelors (me), a kid with a psychology bachelors, and a guy who used to teach robotics to build and invent all these supposedly ""groundbreaking AI"" solutions. 

Surprise, surprise: getting a bunch of people with no specific AI or CS background to invent reinforcement learning solutions with a completely unconventional symbolic AI framework (if it can even be called AI!) didn't pan out so well!

---

So now I'm in the shitty and unenviable position of trying to figure out where to even fucking look for my next job. 

**Data analysis** postings need SQL and data visualization. We never had datasets or databases big enough to require SQL. We weren't trying to tell stories with data, so data visualization [outside of matplotlib or plotly graphs as part of exploratory Jupyter notebooks] was practically non-existent. I still have SQL listed on my resume, since I have done some SQL lessons and am confident I can Google my way to solutions. If there's any virtue to be had in being thrown into a field you're unqualified for (in my case: trying to invent useful and scalable solutions with explainable, symbolic AI), it's that you learn to be resourceful with books and Google to learn just enough of something to become passable at it. 

**Data science** positions often require expert-level strength in being able to do statistical modeling. I've never really done that, despite my entire career so far being in ""AI"". I used some baby math and stats for some solutions, but most things I was able to do using various Python packages. I don't have a whole lot of honest stats modeling experience. The whole point of the startup's ""AI"" was that it didn't create models! Now, much of what myself and my poor coworkers tried to do was modeling the outputs of the company's AI to create ""schemas"" or ""frames"" out of a ""learned"" (learned in quotations because this ""AI"" framework didn't really learn anything) knowledgebase, but again, this was mainly using a lot of premade modules from various Python packages. And, anyway, I became so jaded with the company's ""product"" and the awful work environment (founder was a fucking maniac, surprising no one) that I basically started quiet quitting after my first year. I deeply regret that, as I could have at least used work as an opportunity to upskill. But hindsight is always 20/20. 

**Machine learning engineer** positions are closest in description to what I was made to do as a ""solutions engineer"", except I don't have nearly the required SWE background, nor traditional AI background to really be competitive in this space. 

**Sales engineering** (which I've often seen as being synonymous with solutions engineering) is similar to what a lot of my job actually ended up being: building and running demos for clients to try and get them to buy in. But I really hated this part of my job and wouldn't particularly enjoy doing this for a living. I much preferred the more behind-the-scenes technical aspect of my role. The even bigger problem is that sales or solutions engineering roles are all very dependent on what specific technologies, industry, and products the company is seeking support for. I only have experience with this one shitty AI startup whose foundational technology is not used anywhere else (because it was made up by the founder who never bothered to put the resources into actually making it scalable and production ready). 

**Data engineering** is a nonstarter, as I didn't really handle large volumes of data whatsoever. Much of our work was using basically toy datasets to build R&D demonstrations, that were basically like stupid little puppet shows we'd put on for prospective customers.

---

Oh, and the customers. I was ""lucky"" enough to have been the lead engineer on the only paid contract the company ever won throughout my entire three-year tenure there [is it any wonder we went under?]. I went in knowing that the company mainly marketed itself to DOD and IC customers but felt I had no choice but to accept the only offer I had after 6 months on the market. I hate the defense industry. No offense to the people who serve our country, but it's just not my environment, and not something I like. I took on the aforementioned contract hoping it would ensure a paycheck through a very stressful period of my life and felt that it was my only choice for keeping the bills paid. I hated it the entire time. But it's pretty much **the main thing** I have to talk about regarding my experience there. I had an actual, paying client who I was accountable to. That's only experience I have like that. 

The problem is that it seems to me that the data world is very industry dependent. So now I feel like I'm sort of locked in to the defense industry. I had people trying to help refer me to their own companies, but none of them wanted anything to do with my application, even with referrals. The connections I happen to have are mainly media and marketing data professionals who I was generously introduced to through a family friend. These companies want people with media and marketing backgrounds, not me.

"The employees of the client did in-house tests. Not that high participation rate.. and well I dont know why we cant get more. My boss just says we’re not gonna open testing again. Why is beyond me. 

What we do have is A LOT of employee performance data. Each day an employee worked we got data on their performance on a KPI and other data points that relate to factors that influence the KPI, like miles driven etc. 

The best idea I have is to use all the data to train an initial model on a train/test/validation set. Then use the predicted KPI performance of the employees that Did the tests (so about 40 in total) and use the Inital model’s predictions as the outcome variable of the next model. 

That way I can control for the factors that influence performance, get accurate predictions and see how the test-related variables can be used to explain these ”initial predictions”.

"I was a hiring manager for a large data analytics department, and I worked with recruiters a lot.  I think you're running up against a couple of issues.  With no relevant work experience, you should be commanding an entry level rate.  However, you have a MS degree, which usually means that the applicants will want MS level money.  Those two things don't mesh, so recruiters (or the screening systems they're using) will automatically filter you out.  To get around this you need to do a few things: first, go to career fairs at your school, because the employers showing up there will be specifically looking for folks with your specific degree.  Second, you need to network hard.  Find out what employers you're interested in, and start doing some LinkedIn research.  You'll likely know somebody who knows somebody at that organization.  Try and get an informational interview or even something less formal to discuss the company and the department you'd want to work in.  Third, use your career center at the school to review and update your resumes.  They really aren't intuitive to build, especially with all of the technological hoops they have to get to before ever being seen by a human being.  ChatGPT can be useful, but the folks at your school build and polish resumes for a living, so they can't be beat.  Lastly, I definitely would not recommend another degree unless you get a PhD and become a researcher or R&D.  Another degree will price you out of the market even more.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsYnJleGpyV1gzdFZwVWRvVkM4SEJCX29vbEtwSnhuN1Nqc3BUSTgtWjVkcEZLYTJQOW8ycmprZ3VoSFdBZnp3QkIyVzJEVlE3VjY5am9yYUJDa0xkclE0VUdva2NoNHc5VmNTaUw0MnBGQm89

I'm pretty much lost since I don't have much idea where to start.
Would be very helpful if you share your insights on what skills are needed nowadays, will it be easy to get a job in this field again, do I need to get certifications? Do I need to enroll in a school and get masters degree? which platforms, could be helpful on doing that.

"Path Forward

Hello All. I'm Masters student pursuing an MSc in Data Science and AI (stats focus). For my thesis project, I am pursuing a Quant finance project with implementing Reinforcement Learning frameworks (I have till April 2025 to finish it). However, going through the research, it seems that RL has taken a backseat to LLMs and Gwnerative AIs? I'll be candid, I don't have any specific field of interest (post graduation). I'd be happy to get a MLE job post graduation, but now I'm confused should I focus on RL, Deep Learning, LLM and Genrative AI, or Computer Vision. I know there's overlap between these disciplines, but I'd like to focus on a couple of specific areas. If I have to say about specific industry interest then I'd say I'm interested in compqnies/products which cater to Consumer (Behavior/Media/Analytics). I understand that traditional ML methods (supervised/unsupervised) are still the way to go, and I do focus on those too. I would appreciate any advice.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsR194Y2Y1XzZ5YmExTWNIWHZraXluYlJ6Z1dubjZxeHdNSG84Q2JsaHZWMWZIVFU3SG9NNWl6T240ZUNNcDhQaU9xekFFYzRZUXF6YXJYRUowelNoUXc9PQ==

"ML Projects and GitHub Help

Hi! I’m new to the community posting wise but I’ve been a lurker forever. I have about 8 years experience in data visualization and analytics. Primarily business intelligence (Tableau, PowerBi, etc.) with a few certs in AWS and I just finished the first year of my masters in Data Science at UMBC. I loved it and did really well (4.0!) I’m excited to fully pivot into data science/machine learning, but I feel behind the curve. Could be imposter syndrome? Could be just wanting to learn more? 

At any rate can anyone offer tips/guidance on the following: 

1. Where can I practice becoming more fluid with my python coding? I feel like I need to be faster. Should I focus on leetcode and kaggle? 

2. I have one major project and plan to develop more this summer but any tips on how to build out my GitHub? Any assistance with finding interesting projects? 

3. I’ve been casually looking at jobs and I seem to be qualified for quite a few. Should I start applying now? I feel like I have the knowledge but idk if I could pass a live technical interview even though I know SQL and python fairly well. Maybe nerves? 

Anything else I should know or be preparing for with this pivot?

"Generally for this setting id recommend to look into bayesian structure learning for PGMs. See Koller , Friedman chapter 18 http://mcb111.org/w06/KollerFriedman.pdf . They develop standard metrics to quantify the match of the learned structure to the data. The only details here to be careful are i) watch out for data size, their methods dont scale well so you might need to write your own libraries ii) be careful about how you represent the sequence especially if there can be loops (non DAG) - can potentially break basic bayesian network assumptions.

"Does this still seem like nothing but hype to you guys?  
Neuroscientists use AI to simulate how the brain makes sense of the visual world:

In the following article about how neuroscientists are using AI to understand how the brain processes visual information, it discusses the development of a new kind of AI algorithm called a topographic deep artificial neural network (TDANN). This AI model is able to replicate the way that neurons in the brain organize themselves in response to visual stimuli. The researchers believe that this new approach will have significant implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. For neuroscientists, the TDANN could be used to study how the visual cortex develops and operates. This could potentially lead to new treatments for neurological disorders. For artificial intelligence, insights from the brain's organization could be used to develop more sophisticated visual processing systems. The findings could also help explain how the human brain operates with such stellar energy efficiency. In future work, the researchers hope to use the TDANN to develop virtual neuroscience experiments that could be used to test hypotheses about the brain more quickly and cheaply.

Training large language models on next sentence prediction (NSP) more closely matches human brain activations: 



“The research team trained two models, one with NSP enhancement and the other without; both also learned word prediction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from people reading connected sentences or disconnected sentences. The research team examined how closely the patterns from each model matched up with the brain patterns from the fMRI brain data.



It was clear that training with NSP provided benefits. The model with NSP matched human brain activity in multiple areas much better than the model trained only on word prediction. Its mechanism also nicely maps onto established neural models of human discourse comprehension.



The results give new insights into how our brains process full discourse such as conversations. For example, parts of the right side of the brain, not just the left, helped understand longer discourse. The model trained with NSP could also better predict how fast someone read—showing that simulating discourse comprehension through NSP helped AI understand humans better.“

"Disagree with people saying a portfolio is a waste of time - it’s not, for multiple reasons. 

1) it will positively affect your success rate- try incl. in your resume along strong experience- i think your callbacks for interviews and overall success rate probably doubles or so. Anyone who doesn’t believe me - run a simple test with randomly incl. examples of work on one resume vs not- you will see im right (unsure exact magnitude of the effect but expect it to be large, actually partly because so many view it as not useful to incl :))
2) you will learn a bunch of stuff which will get you 2-3 steps ahead your peers who think its a “waste of time” . Rewarding in itself , you will be able to do more, go deeper, faster on average than others. You will notice it in your work, guaranteed. Also a secondary boost on success rate

"IMO, being 'closer to maths' is more beneficial if you aim to specialize in a research-focused industry or if you're working on cutting-edge paradigms, like creating new implementations in a new programming language or implementing new models from the latest research papers. This requires understanding the intricacies of ML algorithms and various optimization methods.

However, you don’t need this level of expertise to grow as a Data Scientist in a typical role, where the goal is to bring value to shareholders (whatever this means). Developing new algorithms and implementations is time-consuming and requires highly specialized teams. Frankly, it's not something 95% of data scientists need daily, as their primary focus is solving business problems within short timeframe. This can almost always be addressed using conventional methods (e.g., `from sklearn import ...`).

That said, having a solid understanding of what's happening under the hood is highly beneficial. For example, when building a neural network model, defining the correct loss function is crucial. The model's performance depends on the neural net architecture and the loss function chosen. Understanding these aspects helps avoid going down the wrong rabbit hole and solves problems faster than those without this knowledge. But there’s a balance—you need to know just enough.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsc1FCajd0eEQ0bUkyZnZlcHpXQTR0b2llVl9CVlVHdUEycF95dVFfbTZCY3NtNmFrQTc4TlVhUzBFR3puUXRjNHdHdHlZT19OMXlVTkhwd2VJYkFyckE9PQ==

"First things first: I am currently familiarising myself with text mining and am still very much at the beginning. I don't want or expect any ready-made codes for my problem. 

I would like to describe my project below and would be grateful if someone could give me ideas or methods for a rough approach. As the topic is simply very complex to understand.

I would like to recognise trends based on a database of scientific articles, such as Trends like AI, ChatGPT, Security.I have started to clean the data (Stop Words, ...) and am currently experimenting with LDA. The problem is that I often get words that occur frequently but are not trends per se (e.g. ‘data’ or ‘management’).

Is there a way to analyse the text and get only words which could be trends? I suspect that this might go in the direction of machine/deep learning to build a model that looks at whether a word is a trend or not?

But as I said, I would be grateful for any feedback or a roadmap with the core terms or methods for implementation! If I have forgotten any important details, I will be happy to add them if required.

"I work in data analytics at a pretty big solar farm. I am trying to think of how you would make a model to predict the total max output, and it seems likely that model would still include many mini-predictions for each hour. 

I’m not sure where you are, but where I am, maximum solar output is on average around noon or a little earlier. That isn’t the time of maximum sunlight, but it is the time when the sunlight is highest compared to the heat (as solar panels lose efficiency when they get too hot.). This is ignoring cloud cover and more true in the summer, when it is most hot.

So the biggest factors in solar power output are solar irradiance and temperature. Solar irradiance can be calculated pretty well, except for cloud cover, so I usually split it into 3: solar irradiance, cloud cover, and temperature. All three can have massive effects on your model. The main crux is that the interactions between them aren’t really linear. Like a 50% chance of clouds at 2 PM is meaningless unless there were cloud at 12 PM. So you would need to build a model to predict the chance of clouds at 12 PM first. If there is a 50% chance of clouds then, then you would want to go to the next time, let’s say 12:30, and predict the chance of clouds again. There is a 50% chance there were no clouds at 12 and this 12:30 model doesn’t matter, but that also leaves 50% chance the clouds were there at 12 and this 12:30 model is needed. Predicting the chance of clouds at 12:30 is more complicated though, because it will be correlated with the 12:00 model. So it might be a 50% chance of clear skies, but only like a 5% chance of clear skies after the 12:00 had cloud cover.

I apologize for the wordiness of it. As I started getting into it I kept remembering more things we need for our own models. I hope I made the idea of the model clear though: we start with the time that should be the best, ignoring cloud cover and temperature, then we work forward and backwards in time from there. It is mostly individual models at each time increment, but there are a couple variables we pass between the models to deal with the correlation between them. 

Other things to consider: 
- cloud cover does not mean no power. We have to account for chance of cloud cover, percentage of sky covered by clouds, and cloud opacity. Some clouds are thin but don’t completely kill power output.
- do your panels have trackers or are they stationary? We have some panels that don’t track, and they’re positioned slightly off so they get more power later in the day as energy prices tend to go up then.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtM1p0ZVNRTy1YUHpLbUhUOGU3bjlDamJOeTBDVDVPWi05YnROVXRfRF9nZURDRzhpZGNUQWhTU0s2WGQ3VHlhaFRRV0tzd3dmbjcxdFFhdk1vS21uRDRfSkJabTJzSEZsZUdoYVp5Sk9aRlE9

"First, I don't think you know which ones are wrong in production. If you did, you wouldn't use a model.

You should probably take a step back and consider data balance and whether accuracy is the right metric (it probably isn't and you're thinking your model is better than it is). Look into precision, recall, and F-scores.

As part of validating, you might want to characterize and  understand the types of errors the model makes. Maybe you want to collect more data or do augmentation to reduce specific types of errors.

Once you have everything properly validated, you have to accept some error coming through the pipeline. Track as many metrics as you can to understand how data inputs and pipeline outputs are changing over time. As the data evolves over time, your measurements of generalization and error analyses will no longer hold. Significant change should alert you to retrain. Additionally, think of ways you can collect some feedback on predictions (if possible) to generate newer datasets to train with.

Edit: typo fix",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtQUZvcDJTVVhHWlBSVzlJNlVtMURLd2RkLW45eV9ReV9XcWc0bVFaalBTa003ZG05NFRtWUZGMUUwTFk1QjIzQ210QzBHMmJVejRGSDdHbGlHS0ZrU1E9PQ==

"Also know that annotations also have an error rates. Imagenet data had around 3-5% error. You won't realistically reach 100% for any metric. The return on effort is logarithmic too. 

For most metrics 

.5 to .8 is a relative effort of 1. 

.8 to .9 is 10x that. 
.9 to .95 is 100x that
For every 9 after, the effort keeps going up.

Also what's the prevalence of you positive class? If it's also 95% them your model isn't performing well (Think constant predictor). Accuracy isn't always the best metric, and metrics shouldn't be evaluated in isolation. 

Sometimes you'll also saturate metrics. At that point it's no longer a model problem, but a data/feature problem.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtUVUtTEgxTks3ajRsUWNRVUxQOE9Wa21sQi1wekhjQzd3eFhRMWZVMFdHN3NWaEhsbjlEXzVDYk1NR3VDcDIyYkk3bk1uRDdQVlhDczBSUHg3eTcxdE9ERllYVnpPcnp3SUxGTVFOXzRDMk09

"Are you certain you can get admission for an MS in Applied Math at a top 20? I ask because I don't know your background academically, and it might not be the cost that holds you back tbh. 

Depending on where your ugrad and ds degrees are from, a 2nd MS in Math from a school that places directly into tech (University of Washington for Amazon for example, or better), might be worth it. If you did your DS degree online at a large school like Georgia Tech or something, I'd definitely encourage it.

That being said, I think you could break $200k in a HCOL area in 5 years, depending on your role in finance WITHOUT THE 2ND MS.

"Just to add to what others already mentioned, version control would be the first priority for a couple of things:
1. You can track code changes better.
2. You don't have to manually copy and paste code from dev to prod. You can separate dev and prod branches.
3. Prevention of catastrophic failure. That is, if your server suddenly shuts down, you would still have backup for all versions deployed in prod.

git is pretty cheap these days. I think the bigger challenge for you is how to drive that transformation using soft influence.

Starting out blunt, don't know if I should even do data science, definitely interested in CS since I did my undergad in it, but I want to specialize in all aspects of spatial computing/vr/ar. Also have some IT certifications under my belt, was thinking of a more general computing and information technology course route.

Anyways, aspects of engineering has always interested me, I plan on working with computer vision and robotics, AI, all this stuff interests me.

My options are as following:

University of Nottingham
University of Manchester 
University of Warwick
University of Dhurham
University of Birmingham 
University of St Andrews 

I've heard good things about Warwicks mathematics/computer science field, as well as aspects of their engineering.

However, University of Manchester has shown interest in robotics, and in comparison Nottingham has shown interest in robotics and investment in virtual reality tech. 

St Andrews seems to have very good concentrated facilities, and their teaching seems to be more focused, more personal.

Not really interested in the city, all I need is a computer and not to get stabbed. 

Would like to hear any aspects from your point of view on the universities, anything - teaching, course flow, specialization, anything really.

Thanks and stay safe and healthy",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtSUhVTkYxMWVxOHd2bkVrSGYzeUI5R2M4V2hlZVM5M1EybVk3NFlFYzlNRHZMV2trWGlpU2JtTFpLc1NNT1BxaF9aVjJGY3F1YjJ2Ry13eWtXS2pjb3c9PQ==

"I'm not sure if this question is for humor or real. I'll treat as real.

1. **Evolution of need.** Many models needed by businesses, especially those that are used for internal operations and administration, are commodities these days. There isn't a premium to build new model architectures in these spaces, really, since commodity models give enough lift.

2. **MLOps is to lower the human costs (labor costs)**: its a darn good idea spend time learning MLOps principles and getting certifications on various useful tools -- Databricks, AWS, Azure, Snowflake, etc. -- proves your capabilities with the tool stack. Note that skill hires (based on experience/certifications) typically command a lower premium than talent hires (specific knowledge base).

3. **Businesses are leery to pay for R&D**. Data science requires discovery -- aka R&D -- for things that aren't off the shelf. Many companies have been burned by R&D that goes nowhere and have no appetite for it.

4. **XAI/Fair AI are increasingly important.** Check out the NIST AI RMF -- it's a good framework to adopt. It highlights the recognition that AI/ML is part of a production process. Learning how quantitative models integrate into a business' service or delivery is a positive action for your career.

5. **To make sure your work is accepted, get a strong executive sponsor.** Ideally whomever owns or has the ear of the owner of the purse strings. That can be the CFO, the CEO, a director who can clear the lane, you name it. Actively identify who this is, convince them or abandon the idea for a better one, and your ideas will become easier to get adopted.

"I’m currently wrapping up my MSDS degree at Colorado. I’m a 40 year engineer working full time and I have two kids. The CU online program breaks  courses down to 1 credit hour chunks that can easily be completed over lunch breaks or evening. I’m clearly not a full time student. 

Okay so my experience has been good. I’d say the content is 50% new and 50% previously learned. The new content has been engaging whereas the previously learned content has been boring. The TA support has been good. 

When I started the degree I was seeking a career change. I have carved out a niche in my current role as ‘the stats and data model guy’ and this has helped my advancement. I’ll likely never be a hired data scientist at this stage of my career as starting over again would be a nonstarter financially. That wasn’t my objective when I started the program. My objective was to get the degree to help me break through professional barriers. I can honestly say that this degree appears to have done this for me.

"Guidance with Data Science

I'm a 17-year-old male college student studying BICTE. I've been interested in data science since I was 15, but my college doesn't offer any courses in this field.

"I don't understand why this is so low

Data engineering is always the biggest challenge at my job. 

Not because the data doesn't exist or because people aren't asking the right questions or because people have the wrong expectations.

Just, fundamentally, the data engineering sucks. Data lags are huge. Data runs slowly. Data is stored in views instead of tables, making it slow. No one runs table stats or creates indexes or partitions on their tables. No documentation. processes fail silently. 

Bad data engineering creates a ton of extra work for me.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtN0FxdDBkcGpoSVFqeGRiUkh5Y2xQNXlHQmFJVU9HcmVCeDRfZEpwVHU3b0w0RXNPZHNkZkUtTm82X3kzb0dGQzRvcEJSaXMxQ0swSnJ5SDFLeWNuT2c9PQ==

"As a current data engineer, this fits with my preconceptions and I agree wholeheartedly: we do all of the heavy lifting and the precious little data ""scientists"" just write a couple of 10 line scripts to randomly split the data into different subsets and run linear regressions or (if they're feeling fancy) machine learning libraries on the output. They then expect people to treat them like Nobel Prize winning particle physicists. 

Only joking. You guys are great, and I've done enough data sciencing in my time to know that it's harder than it looks.

To be honest, from where I am, the biggest problem I see for data scientists is that (the ones I work with at least) rely on models which don't have a close enough resemblance to the real world to be useful with the data. Things like: assuming that all amounts will be positive, when in the real world things like negative repayments exist; assuming that a company will only offer n products, when in reality they offer n³; assuming that most data fields will never be null, when real world data is sparse; generally assuming that their preconceptions about what data should look like are correct and that the real world processes that produce it are somehow ""wrong""; when in reality these issues aren't a matter of the data needing to be better ""cleaned"" or engineered, but of data scientists' models needing to be adjusted.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtYUczOGNMSFRIVFJaX0h1MU1GUlhVVHVTZ2F6QnRrcHNlcnlxN3hjWS1QVGNHbVNrOVg0dXRXYTVBR3BXNko0MzhfRkQzVmRKS181bEh0Z3oxb3h1djVWTTRCbjR6ekJrcndia1FSVHEwTFk9
"**Should I go for Degree or Skills?**  
  
Hi everyone!  
  
I don't have a background in Data Sci or Computer Sc. but I have developed a great interest in Data Science.

I want to become a Data Analyst. Already working on it.   
Done with Excel.   
Learning MYSQL for now.   
After that will learn Tableau & Python.  
  
Acc. to my research securing employment in Data Analytics doesn't require a background (degree) in computer sci. as long as one has the necessary certification. I plan on getting the certification from Coursera and some other sites as well.

What I am not sure about is whether I should keep learning from online sources or should get admission in MS Data Science.

The benefits I see in getting a MS DS degree:  
1. It will help me further refine my skills in Data Analytics.  
2. It can also open the door towards Data Scientist career.

Is getting a degree really worth it?

I agree that a lot of people don’t have a good understanding of the real world and how it relates to the data. Especially true of the processes that create the data (customers have to sign a contract before you can get a rate card, a new service has to exist before it has a price on that rate card, etc.)

But like…. My gripe is that the current engineering solutions makes engineers’ life easier and life for end users harder. I can’t run an explain plan on my queries because all of the upstream tables are views… and the recommended solution is to create a table version of the view into your own schema.

"Fair gripe. 

I think that's a particular instance of the same general problem that takes up most of my time: we have good tools for transforming data from one form to another, but pretty crap tools for measuring how and why the data has been transformed.

The easy part of my job consists in hammering user input into our required in-house relational data schema; the hard part of my job consists in doing so in such a way that we are then able to make sense of the resulting data loss.

My manager thought it would be a great idea to replace them with somebody from the same country. Turns out they're a fraud too. But I think they're here to stay.

"I work in the social sciences and believe in consumer lead decision making. The problem is qualitative researchers are not statisticians and do not realise that quantity matters to ensure an effect is not missed.

What they don’t realise that to ensure sufficient power they need a much larger sample to reach the 80% power level (for any size of effect they want to measure) 20 depth interview just not hack it 

This leads to model mispecification and so data models only take into account effects that are measured.

Other than that, Causal Inference and Discovery in Python by Aleksander Molak is good, but I find all examples too simplistic (but great for learning as well). 

Last, the author of Causal Inference for the Brave and True has also recently released a more complete version of the free book. Search for Causal Inference in Python from Matheus Facure. It is complementary to the Brave and True rather than a full replacement.

As for today, I consider those three to be the best ones.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM2NqOHVHWGhVNWJ0R3ZWcGY3UU91Zm1Xalc4MHh4a1hpRElDN0k5OHozNk83R3Znd2JiQldUWU9iU241bDR6bGZHR1RQaU9ZbU9wMzNXei16aThBQ3c9PQ==

"Quick story.  I work for a mid sized consulting company and have been in and out of DS for over 20 years.  When the GenAI craze kicked off last year, every non technical principal at the firm became an armchair AI expert overnight - spinning up decks and hosting video/podcasts talking about how we’re fully equipped to solve any AI challenge.  Absolutely frustrating to be mid career and seeing people pull the power card to land grab.  It completely alienated every data scientist at the company and some have quit since then.  But this story actually has a bitter sweet ending bc as our numbers slowly decline at the org level, the owners came in a fired every principal trying to recast themselves into AI as they still weren’t actually selling AI projects.

And I feel like this is the real crux of our challenges as data scientists.  We’re a relatively younger group and c suites are proactively trying to keep us numbers people out of the top ranks.

"Paul Rosenbaum - Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference. Some of my favorite statistics writing ever:

""Having an exact distribution is nice, like having a sharp crease in your trousers, but it is not one of life's larger achievements.""

""Rather than ""Simpson's paradox,"" the pattern in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 might more accurately be called ""Simpson's irritating reminder"" because the relationship between these tables is commonplace and perfectly intelligible, just disappointing. Simpson's irritating reminder is disappointing in the same way that the reminder ""Everyone is mortal"" is disappointing: no one doubts its truth or finds it puzzling, but we keep trying to put the matter out of mind.""

""Typically, if you analyze one data set several times in slightly different ways, you simply repeat yourself.

"> AI bubble

There's definitely too many companies that started AI infrastructure businesses (they are all begging hugginface to buy them now) or training foundation models. Next tier down is the companies trying to apply it in domains that don't make sense or spending a lot on consultants to basically end up with an overpriced RAG Chatbot that never gets tested and underperforms commodity search/CustomGPTs. Once you get past those, though, I think there's quite a bit of durable value creation and disruption.

That said, there's an even bigger bubble lurking: SaaS direct sales. SaaS companies have been spending so much to acquire new customers, even while the customers get smarter and make their buying decisions without a salesperson more and more often, that many of them take 6 years to pay off acquiring a customer now. 0% interest rate days are over and these companies are all waking up to it. This is going to interact with AI and the potential bubble in interesting ways - i.e. it will be hard to tell if a company died because of chasing AI or because of an unsustainable acquisition model.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuN1RzMmJFN1E4cWs1b01zRmZGTFFMcEVZU2VjN2s5OGtSakpWbUZPckZ6M0JtTGFLaFowaE5fd3ljaDlwYmNMR1RtZGFHZXhSMVpjUk81LWZHdk50VEE9PQ==

"I've read a bunch.  Here are what I found useful in ascending order of usefulness.

* _Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction_.  Incredibly verbose and very mathematical.  Ruben (or maybe its Imbens writing) is just so long winded that you can safely skip paragraphs at a time.  Only recommended if you want a very mathematical treatment of the subject.

* _The Effect_ and/or _Mixed Tape_.  These books are written at the same level, by the same type of person.  My advice would be to pick the book according to color (The Effect is teal, Mixed Tape is Orange, pick what you like).  I think Mixed Tape has R and python code so maybe that will swing you one way or another.  My chief complaint about these books is that they are very example driven, which is hard when I know next to nothing about the topic (e.g. police stops, education, etc etc).

* _Counterfactuals and Causal Inference: Methods and Principles for Social Research_. Good book that explains DAGs and a bunch of introductory causal inference methods.  I think reading this is when causal inference really started to _click_ for me, but lacks explanation of several topics (e.g. regression discontinuity).  The treatment is fairly general with repeated applied examples used in the book.  This is an improvement over the last two in my own opinion.

* _What If_.  Good book by one of the most important people in modern causal inference.  Very good treatment of the potential outcomes framework, and the only book I've seen which examined the g-computation.

I don't think there is 1 book which will teach you everything.  In my experience, reading each of these was nice because some concepts were re-enforced while others were re-introduced in new ways which helped me understand a lot of stuff.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuM2tlcldzMHhBS2xYY3lnUlBmbjUzbzFTQVNwR04xUnQ0SjVHbzdpMWFLM0lzTlRzTms3OGhPdTU0d3VRY3ZkVXppZWlPeGZSX1d3T0ZiTEFhRFFpTUpqZndqVjc5Y1JvOUlPTmJZbllSbDQ9

You can add \\`jax\\`, \\`jaxlib\\`, \\`numpyro\\` and \\`blackjax\\` to use the Jax backend with the blackjax and numpyro samples.  You can also use the \\`nutpie\\` sampler to take advantage of the fast Numba backend.

"Hi,

Given I work with a lot of data, I took on and have just finished a 4 year on the job Bsc degree apprenticeship in Data Science, I loved it and am trying to figure out what I do next. 

In terms of continuing my education my workplace offers two options that I can pursue starting the end of September, I have to make a final decision by July.

Level 7 A.I and Data Science apprenticeship with Cambridge Spark: [https://www.cambridgespark.com/data-apprenticeships/level-7-ai-data-science](https://www.cambridgespark.com/data-apprenticeships/level-7-ai-data-science)

MSc Data Analytics with BPP: [https://www.bpp.com/courses/data-and-technology/apprenticeships/applied-data-analytics](https://www.bpp.com/courses/data-and-technology/apprenticeships/applied-data-analytics)

I'm truly torn, in the long term I want to fully transition to a Data Science Career. I feel a MSc would be more favourably viewed by employers than a level 7 certificate and the course content is more relevant to my current position. However the Cambridge Spark course simply sounds more interesting overall and may be more relevant a couple of years from now.

Any opinions would be appreciated.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuQjZHbjFKLUxYUW50a3FlaTlmaFN6eERnZ01zbTh0MzZucUdXT2lRQXJfQU9hRkxxRWJybUZ4N1lBME9vUFFjekk2bEZ1QkMwMUR4SFZrcHRKZzFwbVE9PQ==

"Guessing you wanna do an MS in DS for grad school? In that case, statistics will be a great advantage here since a lot of ML algorithms are rooted in statistics, but you'll also be learning calculus in stats, which is very important. Also, stats classes will likely teach you programming in R and SAS.

UW would be a better choice for undergrad, not only for rankings but also because it's in Seattle, so you're in proximity to a bunch of big companies with DS internships. If I could go back without doing a BS in DS, the next best thing would be a BS in Statistics. I recommend getting at least a minor in CS to get more of those programming classes in, Python and SQL are two other huge languages in DS.

">GPT has been around a while now and improvements are minimal. 

Improvements have been minimal?

I was in a meeting with my boss today and he said: ""I can't believe how much easier this stuff is now compared to six months ago. GPT-3.5 isn't smart enough to do what we needed and GPT-4 was way too expensive.""

Our use-case went from ""basically impossible"" to ""easily doable"" in the last six months.

GPT-3.5, which is the model which rocked the entire world 18 months ago is now in position 60 with an ELOs score of 1068 compared to 1287 for GPT-4o.

And GPT-4o is cheaper AND faster than GPT 3.5 was at launch.

">They want someone to hold accountable in the event of a data breach, and they believe that paid software is the way to do that.

Based on just one sentence I'm saying you're a long way off being ready for data science.

What is the state of your data governance? Who owns data assets? Who authorises usage? What is the process for allowing access, and how is that documented? What level of cyber security/ data security training is in place? What audits/ detections/ logs do you have? Do you have an effective least privilege security model? Do you have documented change processes?

I could go on, but you get the gist.

Buying something *does nothing* to mitigate your professional, ethical or market/ brand responsibility. The idea that the company thinks they can cut a cheque to abdicate their responsibility indicates an abysmally low level of data maturity.

"I’m not disagreeing with you that there are massive improvements that can and should be made.

You have an ethical responsibility to behave appropriately and in the best interests of the organisation whenever you use the data and resources you have the privilege of having access to.

If you're so full of self interest that you can't see that responsibility, and you can't see that *I've outlined the proper way to get what you want* then you are part of the problem. You can choose to be better, and professionals choose to be better, because that's what professionalism *is*.

"It takes time and trust building, and there's frankly no way around that.

As far as them making insane demands that you will never be able to deliver: this is partially down to the temperment of the stakeholder in question and you can never fully eliminate it. What you can do is engage with them and make it clear that what you need to understand is their pain point, not what they believe will solve their pain point. A lot of people resist this initially, but try to be honest and say that it's not always possible to produce a useful model of something for any number of reaons (ultimately it all comes data availability/quality, but try to give more proximate causes as appropriate), but there may be other ways to address the problem. Especially because alternatives might be faster or easier to deliver. 


For building trust in your models: at least in traditional industry I've found that people tend to trust _people_ much more than they trust _models_. Though this may change as the older generations eventually retire. In general I've found that it's best to engage with your stakeholders early and often- and again, always try to get face time (or video call time) with the person with the problem, not their boss or the person who directly asked you. Ask to shadow them to understand their painpoints and how this thing they're asking you to predict fits into their workflow. If you get pushback make it clear that this has a number of benefits:

1. Potentially identifying faster and easier ways to address their problem. No executive can resist the allure of a 'quick win'.

2. Understanding the context of a prediction is important because a lot of superficially similar numbers can mean different things. Like what if it turns out that when they need a particular prediction you can't rely on feature X being available? Is the cost of misclassifying Y equally bad for false positives as it is for false negatives? Do you care much more about your numerical prediciton being very wrong than slightly wrong, or does it not really matter beyond a point? Also, you need some basic background to detect bad data, or to know how much it matters if you can explain the model's results. Seriously, context is everything.

3. You can leverage their domain expertise. This is often genuinely beneficial for modeling in feature selection/engineering, because even if some of their heuristics aren't actually right they often have a kernel of truth (do not just go tell them that they're wrong) and they can save you a ton of time in EDA by helping guide you to the most important relationships. In the days of ANNs and AutoML this practically doesn't matter as much (though it does still matter), but I promise you that going through this exercise with dramatically increase your credibility with the person who has the problem.


Basically, to get people to listen to you, you need to make sure they feel that you're listening to them. Do this at the level of the person experiencing the problem, not executives. If they're on your side, their bosses and their bosses bosses will be much more receptive to you.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvbzdNbDZDQk9vM3gxUjVyZWlJSmZsTUhhU1d3cVFXRFdySS11MDhyYmpfcElRWUx5dUd1SmxsNzRSQnYxcXl2WERWWm1NUW9ISm9MNWNySWYtWExSbmc9PQ==

"Agree with matlab - I used it at a company that sounds similar to what you're dealing with. It's very similar to python/R and the team at mathworks actually does a pretty good job of maintaining the products AND has a help line with someone you can talk to (this was big for me since senior mgmt was also worried that with open source I could get stuck or we could have an issue and not have professional support)

  
The downside is that they require more payment for different packages, so I would be very clear about what you need and see the cost of that vs just the baseline. For example, they had an econometrics package that seemed pretty good, but my company wasn't willing to pay for it, so I had to write some functions on my own",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJveWc2aHBULXdSYm9LZXNNZ25UOGtISzlockpCbW0xNG9nWHJOeDNFVmtxdjlGU2w3V3h1VDdGR1U2SnRBU3RIUVlqUXg3d1A2TXFmMmhHVURVV1ZibkhYYnNtUFV1SXB6Z0VOaFZ5NWlrRjg9

"1. Our hype bubble energy has moved to Gen AI: Hiring
People don't hire us 'just cuz' anymore

2. Our hype bubble energy has moved to Gen AI: Misapplication
We are expected to apply that overhyped nonsense where it doesn't belong (when we should be applying our own overhyped nonsense where it doesn't belong!)
* I was convinced of this by a recent Modern MBA video: Why AI is Tech's Latest Hoax 

3. Finding good applications of DS: Heuristics
Most of the time, simple methods do well enough that fancy ML models are not justified. I don't even mean use a linear model instead of Neural Nets, I mean a simple heuristic, summary stats, exploratory analysis.

4. Finding good applications of DS: Snipe Hunts
There have been so many times I have received requests from doctors and other non-mathematical clients based on hunches that are a beast to actually investigate, and never have meaningful results. 

5. Finding good applications of DS: Misaligned Incentives
Has this ever happened to you?
Client: here's my data, show the value I'm adding to my funders
DS: Sure.
DS (later): Turns out your organization is a net negative to the company 
Client: ...
DS: ...
DS Manager: Let's take this offline
[Based on a true story]

I find that sometimes my projects have implications for a level or two above who I'm doing the project for, or generally there is metaphorical money left on the table.

6. Finding good applications of DS: Failure of Imagination 
Has this ever happened to you?
Manager: solve this problem 
DS: while looking at that, I see a major opportunity for improvement over here (more detailed life expectancy methods, cost prediction, price estimation, simulating economic macro trends, etc)
Manager: oh some other team does that (without DS methods). Don't talk to them.
DS: ...

I feel like I see this as an even bigger issue from afar with companies that get tunnel vision for using DS for one specific thing. Like the tragedy of Google using Deep Mind to work on search and ads, leaving GPT for someone else to pick up. Or anything with healthcare having the ability to know what would keep people healthier, but not wanting to jeopardize their profit centers. Or my biggest personal hobby horse, Facebook Dating (I know, I'm one of like 5 humans to ever use it, and after the first week it was just a morbid curiosity.)  Supposedly they have all this data on people, so they should be able to help people pair off, but they couldn't even rid the thing of the most obvious bots! That could just be a lack of resources given to it, but generally dating apps are aligned to keep people on them and spending money. I'm more frustrated by FB dating than the others (or at least I was when people still used FB) because they actually have the data to help people actually match.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvaW9Da1E4aWxrQjNOc2tVU2FxS2dMWlBWeG0tdnp0UjZCSGxLeWQwLUVVLWdiUE1DQ3l2Nl9ENmVJamRIeW80XzhHeWd5ZTFzY0lRSnJ5X2xTUkxGeWpRbnRDbGlHdW5wd0NWcy1xUHVWeUk9

"1. The hype bubble moved from DS to Gen AI: Lower Demand  
'nuff said

2. The hype bubble moved from DS to Gen AI: Misapplication  
Managers want to throw overhyped Gen AI nonsense at every problem, when they should be throwing our overhyped nonsense at it!

3. Overapplication  
Not every project really needs full DS. I have had multiple projects where we didn't need boosted trees, or even a linear model. Just some simple summary stats and heuristics were enough.

4. Snipe Hunts  
Have you ever had a client / manager want to follow some hunch, even though the data would be spotty and difficult to find anything?  It's happened a few times.  Maybe 10% of the time does it turn into anything.

5. Misalignment of Incentives  
I once had a project that wound up showing that our client was losing the company money. What do you even do with that? It becomes less of a DS question and more of an office politics / ethics question.

6. Failure of Imagination  
This is almost the opposite Overapplication, but is not just underapplication.  A few times I have seen opportunities where DS could really fit the use-case, only to be shut down.  ""No no, we need to focus on this thing where we add marginal value. There is another team for that idea that makes sense (don't talk to them).""  Ex: pricing, longevity forecasts based on individuals instead of traditional population averages, pricing (again), random economic data generation, etc.  
In the big companies: Google turning Deep Mind resources to ad optimization and giving up the Gen AI race, political campaigns only using DS to optimize email fundraising, dating apps (especially Facebook Dating. Don't get me started) probably having the info to make real matches but focusing on squeezing money out of users... generally skipping over game-changers and focusing on playing the game slightly more profitably.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvRFFveDRQTFJpaHRtVF9CeHkyYTVUeDJ5YmY2bUxxZUtCdVk5b3lSVVY1S0dTN0I5V0hEYjgtU2dSY2s1ZEg5UzlLNE1NeGhVWXpubGZBUkhHWklrb0g3Nk13VWZCRmJKUjVCdlIydnpJTEk9

Post-graduation, I worked as a Due Diligence Analyst for about a year (contract) and then as a Data Analyst for another year (contract) where I utilized Excel, SQL, and Power BI extensively. Currently, I’m working as a Strategy & Operations Analyst, a role where I don’t directly use data analysis/science tools.

While my career path hasn’t followed the traditional data scientist route, I’ve consistently seized the opportunities that came my way. I possess intermediate to advanced skills in SQL and Power BI, and advanced skills in Excel. I also know other relevant tools, but these are my strongest areas.

I genuinely enjoy working with data and these tools. Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in data science and I’m eager to learn Python to expand my skill set. I’m also considering pursuing an MBA with a focus on Information Systems this Fall. The program offers an advanced certificate in Data Analytics/Science, which I can pursue alongside the MBA.

**Given my background and current situation, I have a few questions**:

1. Can I still become a Data Scientist if I pursue an MBA with a focus on Information Systems and the Data Analytics/Science advanced certificate? Or would a Master’s in Data Science be a better path?
2. Any recommendations on the best resources or strategies to learn Python effectively?
3. Are there any specific skills or tools I should focus on to better align myself with a Data Scientist role?

I appreciate any advice, experiences, or recommendations you can share. Thanks in advance for your time and help!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvZ1BSbS1PNFRydGY4Q0N4dGNORXQteVNlYzhvYk14RHhzdEp0ZDJCdF9NdUhQQnpHZkNIdGRXejVrRk1nOWdFSzNJNVdONVNkM2dfanBDSGhxSFZPSGQ3WlF0MWZwT1RCSzRXd2VNdGVUbWc9

"If you can convince your management to go cloud-based, that's really the better choice. Easier to manage costs, more flexibility, and more long-term potential for growth are all there and all NOT there with running your own infrastructure. At the end of the day, are you an infrastructure company, are you a data company, or are you a company that just needs to do things with data and has some other core concern? If you're not an infra company, don't waste your time building infra. Cloud companies have done it better than you ever possibly could, and provide it to you at an incredibly low cost. Not to mention the industry is very focused on cloud, so if you want to hire people in the future, that's how they will expect to work. You'll have a hard time bringing in people to a environment that isn't cloud-based. 

That said, I know a couple people have mentioned infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and specifically Terraform. I can't recommend IaC enough. It's really the way to go! Instead of manually managing your servers and data resources, you can just describe what you want with code and let the IaC tooling do the work for you. That said, I'd suggest looking at Pulumi, not Terraform. The main reason for that is it sounds like you're a small team, and are primarily data scientists, so you're probably comfortable working with Python. With Terraform, you'd need to learn a whole new language to use it (it's called HCL and it's kind of awkward/confusing). With Pulumi you can just write in Python. That means you can reuse your existing skillset instead of trying to learn new skills and also being stuck being the only person at the company who knows how to work with the infrastructure because you're the only one who knows HCL... ask me how I know, LOL.

(full disclosure: I care about this problem so much that I now work for Pulumi, and I advocate for it whenever I can, because I genuinely think its a better approach. IaC is cool. Terraform is cool, but Pulumi is a next-gen product vs TF and was created with the benefit of hindsight. No shade on what TF has accomplished, but Pulumi just does it better/easier)",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvNlpVLVJacXdfSG5BZ0tYeVZmNFp0eW9fM1JIbkduNV96TklCS2Zhb1NWWm5oWE1qSlljNWExVUpMUGlBeUlpSzQzZkxLbmJZenZHdmxacjZqV2Rmdnc9PQ==

"> having resampled down to equal class sizes

Please don't. You want to train your model on data that matches the distribution of classes that you're going to see in production. Then you can tune your decision threshold using some sort of metric. If you can assign a dollar value to correct/incorrect classifications then you can turn a confusion matrix into a cost-benefit matrix and optimize for profits.

"Interestingly enough, the most helpful thing for me has been to empathize with them. I had a bit of an epiphany that I’ll share:

I was trying to buy a house and going through an inspection: the inspector would tell me a range of problems identified, but wouldn’t tell me what were the scenarios for each identified issue, the likelihood of each one nor the associated cost with each scenario. The moss could be terrible, the foundations could have been compromised by the leak - only added uncertainty. Every time I asked the inspector for specificities, or odds of something happening, they wouldn’t address it out of concern of saying something was low likelihood that could then end up being true.
I was trying to make a decision about buying a house, understand the risk associated, and how much I could potentially end up paying on top of the house’s price.

This helped me realize stakeholders are trying to make informed decisions. They don’t want all the details upfront, they want to minimize risk and they don’t want to waste time.

"I have found more niche communities more helpful and responsive and lack of a good community for Python. If you come from OR background you probably do some optimisation, then Julia JuMP.jl is a good example how many optimisation packages collected under one interface. Also I found Julia community quite welcoming, because it is smaller. But that is another programming language and not an immediate thing to learn. 

Earlier ago StackOverflow was decent, some help may come from r/learnpython, especially if your question is well specified. A lot is just reading the documentation, and now you have ChatGPT, Copilot, CodeLlama for help. Community is nice to have, but it just may not exist as Python skill is becoming generic and people move fast pass the learning phase. Last untrivial thing is hiring someone to fix a specific task when you are really stuck in edge case - and gives an extra skill in explaining your task and negotiation. Does cost money, also better and worse cases, essential to keep the focus on a specific task.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwUHJnTVczVno2Yi1icGk2dHN4djVIVFpiQ1pTYnZaamgzd0lhaEJHNWJqWFp3bWl4WkxHVmRUWmpvclVwV28xd0hMNTltZTJKOWk0MVVkb2lYSU5KaHc9PQ==

"you shouldnt resample except for memory issues/cost of data collection
(this is a common misunderstanding)

https://gking.harvard.edu/files/0s.pdf

you should use regularisation (rare event estimation has high variance)

see figure 6, rmse of probability estimates

the bayesian ( ie regularised) approach outperforms the standard logit, which itself outperforms the bias corrected version

the errors are only noticeable at *3* standard deviations from the mean of the normally distributed independent variable)

and figure 7, where the bias is roughly a 1/10 of the rmse ( and therefore variance ) error

you adjust the intercept to match the incidence rate of the rare event ( on your original training sample)

">Ex: we have to build an upsell model related to specific campaigns. Since some of the products are seasonal it has been suggested that adding yearly data, rather than only the data for the season of interest would reduce the discriminatory power of the model in the presence of static data.

I frequently have to clean data. I work in marketing DS and most of the variables we use are hardly standard statistics textbook variables so transforming and cleaning data works a lot. We also get variables like NPS which clients want a lot but they don't have normal distributions so log transformations can be helpful for including them in models and not having to explain to a client why either 1. they weren't included or 2. the model is more complex to handle non-parametric data. Neither of those conversations normally go down well when talking to a room of people who have worked off the same five metrics for 10 years and have no stats experience beyond looking at averages and bar graphs.,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwTjBXYkI4eWFXYUJiaGJFT3I1X09RNlBKWVVVcE9sUWUyY294cVhSejVQLWsyT2lXbEM3Nm9jWDd6bXRIcGhHTE1KNW1GdlBzZ3Vodld6dWpqdWZWVXc9PQ==
"LLMs are fun blog/emailing writing programs and they have some use with fluffier business roles like marketing copy and strategy copy. I also find it very useful for code debugging like most people.

If you consider the hype has literally said the end of human civilisation is coming from LLMs or that LLMs may transcend into a singularity like god-AI, then yes that are almost objectively hype. 

To be honest if OpenAI has come out and said this is ChatGPT 4 it is a blogger writer and coding buddy no one in the world would have cared. The same way no one outside of DSs and software engineers cared about the earlier coding helpers or Jasper. Saying you've built the new machine god gets a huge amount of media coverage so naturally they went with that.

Actual real experimental DS work is very rare and even amongst other DSs that I work with most are just making dashboards on sales reporting metrics which is not science and the others have just been around for a while but never did lab work. Lots of folks did some analyst job once, last five years and auto promoted to DS when it got popular because the company didn't want to not have one.

"Hi everyone,

I’m a data scientist with 2-2.5 years of experience at a consulting firm, primarily working with transactional and financial data for manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, etc. I have a Master’s in Applied Statistics and strong technical skills from a Python/data science boot camp.

However, I often struggle to connect my statistical/ML/AI expertise to business problems and solutions due to what I think is a lack of business knowledge. My manager is supportive of me pursuing an online MBA, and my company will cover the costs. To me, the MBA wouldn’t be the top item on my resume, but rather complimentary to my experience working in industry. I’ve heard “oh you’ll pick up this or that with experience”, and maybe I’m still so new, but I feel after nearly three years I should feel more confident in identifying business problems and prescribing solutions.

I’m looking for insights from those who have been in a similar position:

	•	Have you pursued an MBA after starting your career as a data scientist or considered it?
	•	How did it impact your ability to understand and solve business problems? Do you think it was worth it? 
	•	Was it worth the investment in time and effort?

Any advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2TE1FWHpNbnNQazh5Y1ZHNFVRaUtYVHM3OHZvWDQ5Zl9CZ1RxLWJpY0l3NkR3QlJ4MlNDRWd6RkJXUFlHYXI5Zmx5N2pKcmE0M3dpM3RUTTl2Z1VsZWFBelpNUVlVT2dvYnlZZG1OdGdjc0k9

"I bet that this issue is a result of misaligned expectations. Now, you may not have control over your boss's expectations but you can influence it to some degree. For example, ask them to provide more details about their ask. You can then estimate the time needed to complete each task and ask them if they agree with your estimates. Also, be ready to justify your estimates.

Bosses who just say ""just do it"" probably lack enough data to provide a reasonable estimate and that means that there is room for negotiation. Unless they are totally unreasonable, if you come prepared with your estimates, you should be able to influence their expectations.

Thats what I'm kinda thinking about, like I have 250 NAs for this one column out of 2500 rows so I don't want to impute. But was wondering if keeping it would help the model capture the values stored in the other columns of the corresponding row where these 250 NAs are present for one column. And  this seems to be an important column so I would like it to learn from the remaining values that are not NA, that's why i don't want to remove this column.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2V3FMWTVsYUNub3NPZGVBd0F6Y1FGOEJwdTVNVE9QelhDdUFvNVQ1UG4zTzYyeFdUQ1lKcHE1TnNVNklzaVdtRjA3UlpOX0hwSDBYNWItR25oeGNLbXc9PQ==

"I can give you advice but I can’t promise it will work.

- Break down your work into subtasks and provide hours estimates. Log your time. Stick to your guns.
- Use version control systems, remote repositories, kanban boards etc. these tools create a paper trail of your work (beyond endless email threads) and help to CYA. They will neutralize the ability for a (reasonable) colleague to blame you for misunderstandings. Document as much as you can. If your manager refuses to manage, then you should devote more hours per week to managing. Document that too.

"I should start by saying I am a Power BI specialist at my company. I've had a bit of an unconventional route to get to this point so I have minimal experience in coding/data management. We are in the process of switching one of our safety tools from one that has a very straight forward integration with Power BI to one that does not. Typically our IT Department provides financial data to me through snowflake while I go directly through the safety tool to get safety data, so our IT department is not going to provide this safety data through Snowflake.

  
I figured I could try and build my own tables in Snowflake, but as mentioned my coding experience is limited. I have at least a basic understanding of SQL, but I have never used Python before. My understanding is if I want to pull data from this new tools API, I would use Python to make requests to the API and pull  data and SQL to query it, organize it, and make tables to pull into Power BI and create reports. Is this correct? Would anyone be able to expand on the relationship between to two?

"Hi all,

I have been attempting (off and on) to get a job in data science for several years, and I don't really know what to do to bolster my resume and actually get my foot in the door. I have an advanced degree (mathematical economics, PhD ABD) from a very well-known \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Institute of Technology, an undergraduate degree in math, and almost a decade of experience teaching in university statistics and CS departments. I did a (kind of a scam, I think!) data science fellowship program a few years ago that left me with a pretty decent project on my github. I have had many final round and onsites, though few recently. One consistent problem I've had is getting passed over for junior positions due to being overqualified, and getting passed over for more senior positions due to lack of experience.

I know for a fact that it has nothing to do with my technical skills, as my conversion rate on technical screens is essentially 100%. I have multiple friends in the industry who have told me they really can't understand why I haven't been able to land a job (I have tried to lean on these networks but just haven't been successful). I always interview well with technical team members. One area that I do know that I can improve in is that I think there is sometimes a disconnect when I interview with more senior/executive level people. Sometimes I feel like a bit of an outsider because I don't use some of the tech/business language that gets thrown around very often in these settings, or that I can't do a convincing enough job of explaining why I want to leave my (very depressing and underpaying) teaching job for one with more security and room for growth. I have tried talking to some friends to get ideas on pointed questions I can ask in those settings. 

Any advice or tips would be supremely appreciated! Thanks so much.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2RENJdjJ4dFBjdlNWYURlWWhuNmNKa3BkUEQ5STBOOEI0anZScmFQbUJGUEhYc19lOFR0R2hkTm05aHlENUJtTGNpanIxb2R5ZS1PZkVPZ0p6Q3dRcFZKWEN3Wk0xQy1hU2RtQ3Vkb192czA9

"Navigating the complexities of restaurant sales data, especially with the issues you've encountered, requires a blend of strategies that involve data analytics, software tools, and possibly even some manual adjustments.



1.Handling Idiosyncratic Notes and Modifications: Implementing NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques can indeed be helpful here. Techniques such as sentiment analysis or keyword extraction might allow you to categorize comments or modifications in a structured manner. You could use Python libraries like NLTK or spaCy to assist with parsing and understanding these textual modifications.



2. Addressing Inconsistent Naming Schemes: A potential approach to standardize item names despite typos and stylistic differences is to implement a fuzzy matching algorithm. Libraries such as \\`fuzzywuzzy\\` in Python can help match similar strings by calculating the distance between words, which can be useful for identifying and consolidating different expressions of the same item name.



3. Analyzing Order Timing Variations: Understanding time-of-day and seasonality effects can significantly enhance your analysis. Tools and techniques that analyze sales data trends over time can be pivotal. For instance, exploring time series analysis to predict busy periods or seasonal trends can provide actionable insights that help in menu planning and staff scheduling.



For more detailed insights and a comprehensive approach:



- Software and Analytics Platforms: Consider exploring specialized restaurant analytics platforms like jalebi’s restaurant analytics software, which can offer in-depth insights into performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency through visual dashboards and detailed reports.



- Restaurant Analytics Best Practices: Engaging with best practices in restaurant analytics can offer guidance on optimizing your menu, reducing food waste, and improving customer satisfaction by analyzing sales data, feedback, and other operational metrics.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2MHl3UUVXdTF5b3F6RnpfRlBFajdIRVFQZVlZTzJ3VDY2Mk01dXVHbUtrbFQ4Q2lVaWs2MHlIcDJQeXhlYWUyM1RHUU5Rd0J5OGFraHNucGhUV19WSFE9PQ==

"You definitely do not need to be a mathematics genius to be a Data Scientist. You do have to be willing to sit down and struggle with mathematics a little bit in the goal of getting a bit better at it (statistics at the college level is more math heavy and can be math heavy depending on the job).

However, not every Data Scientist job is EXTREMELY math heavy. Some require just some basic algebra and stats at most. Even during times where you need more robust mathematics, you can always consult with colleagues, use textbooks, etc. 

Also, do you have a college degree in a field such as Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Economics/Quantitative Social Science? If you don't, then a data science bootcamp is probably not going to immediately get you a Data Scientist job. Maybe a Data Analyst job though (though even that depends on your local job market).

"I've worked extensively with large-scale restaurant data and faced similar challenges.   
  
Using NLP techniques like **tokenization** and **named entity recognition** can help standardize idiosyncratic notes and inconsistent item names; libraries such as spaCy and NLTK are excellent for this. For data cleaning, tools like OpenRefine can be invaluable for standardizing inconsistent entries. To address the heterogeneity in order timing, conducting time series analysis with tools like Pandas and Prophet can uncover patterns related to time-of-day and seasonality. Once the data is cleaned, applying machine learning algorithms can effectively classify items.

Scoping out a project can be a project in and of itself. The best method I found for estimating a project is to get a sample of what's being requested and then build out a sample and then scale up.

"I've been around a while and I've concluded that the 'just do it' mindset isn't an issue of understanding problem solving and solution execution processes. 

This is an issue of personality and power dynamics. They don't care about reasons, they actually don't even care about outcomes or timeframes, all they care about is whether they believe that you've done the best job as fast as possible.

They will never 'understand' because they're not looking to be educated. You have to make them *believe*. This isn't a logic problem or a project problem, it's a sales problem. It's a persuasion problem.

A shitty boss with this approach has two ways to get there. They either need to see you be constantly berated and defeated to the point they're satisfied that you're at breaking point and beating you won't make you row faster; or they need someone to push back so hard that they believe you're at breaking point and fed up with their bullshit.

Start small. Try a grumpy persona. ""Look Jerry, I need to analyse the problem, solve the damned problem, document it, write the code, test it, make sure it doesn't fuck up anything else, put it into source control, get Jenny to peer review it, schedule the change, make the change, test the goddamn change, and then update all the manuals because that's how professionals work. If we want to just half arse it and you want to skip some steps send me an email, otherwise I need you to push back on the customers and let them know that if *they* want quality then it takes some time.""

The problem isn't just that the boss is shitty, it's that they have people pushing on them who know even less than they do, and because they don't really know the work involved they push down instead of pushing back.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2czdLWnVWay1WWW1jZDR2QnVyTUNlQzlUUXRYNXpObmxVSldsc3NMX29SbEJkNGx1OFNScTdLcEdfeEZBNVlLbE1fUzR0c0xTSmVpQThZWjIxRU40RUE9PQ==

I am saying that he is being disrespectful by bringing up Asians and other people's accents as if that makes him better than other job applicants. For one, it literally DOES NOT MATTER what accent you have when you work in Data Science. People care about your ability to do math, stats, computer science and to communicate that information succinctly. You can communicate succinctly with any accent imaginable.

"I was a contractor at some different agencies than the ones you mentioned, and I won’t say much more than that. But there’s a huge difference in the types of jobs you can pull based on whether you have a Secret or a TS/SCI clearance. The latter will be tremendously helpful if you want the flexibility to transfer to other positions. Yes, I think you could ping pong between different jobs as long as you don’t burn bridges and you keep your skills sharp. The combination of federal contractor + qualified data scientist is quite niche and I have seen full time recruiters work hard to hire talent for empty positions for months to no avail. Can’t comment on those agencies in particular, but I did not enjoy my time working as a contractor. I faced the same problems data scientists always face, with the added pressure that my colleagues were mostly neurotic and treated every little thing as a matter of national security. I can’t say it wasn’t stressful. I will say it was an exciting way to start my career, and I actually don’t regret it. I was paid well, I got to work on some interesting problems. However the “data science” that happens in the federal contracting space is different from corporate data science, as you probably won’t be doing SQL queries on a database of sales transactions. And there are seriously federal data scientists who are hired for positions where no data really exists, because an executive living in another state wanted to make their suite of agencies seem more cutting edge on paper. If I were you I would schedule a follow up interview and ask more questions about the type of work they do, the environment, how your performance will be judged, opportunities for advancement, and the data and technologies they work with. Another factor: Maryland puts you closer to D.C., the epicenter of federal contracting jobs. If you’re young you may also just want to pick the job that pays better since you’re at the building-wealth stage of life.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2emcxTnYyRlJJeGlIQmlFMTJ3ZTVwZ3FqMncxM3owUkhIZFl5Y2w4bVVtalNxQk9GcmNUUVhWSEhNY3owdVdrM2p0RmNyaWp3bVNHZEx0MC1rVDhXYnc9PQ==

"If there is anything I have learned in my long work life, it is not just what you do, but where you do it. Many years ago, I was working on a team in a Fortune 500 firm where my brain was being taxed daily with complex tasks that stretched me and yet I was in despair. The company was a good one, so I did not want to depart, and instead looked for other roles, and found one via networking to death. In my new role, my brain was being taxed daily with complex tasks that stretched me, and I was in heaven. Same company, different departments. 

In department 1, I was working for a boss who did not fight for me or appreciate me, on a team where I was odd man out, and which had odd, incomprehensible dynamics. In department 2, I was working for a boss who fought for and appreciated me, where I fit the team like a glove, and the dynamics of the team were client centric.

"What I have learned is that it is not the work that burns me out, it’s the leadership and colleagues. If even 1 is outstandingly bad, it can really be crushing. The work is a constant and it is often full of ups and downs. Well mostly downs until you figure it out, get the great insight etc. Otherwise it’s a lot of failures to get there. So if you have an outstandingly bad colleague or leader it just compounds those days of trial and error 100x. 

So if you are feeling burned out, check if it is the environment too. Those bad colleagues, try to figure out how to not let them add to the work burn out.

"Yup, that's burn out alright.

As a person who experienced this HARD as an English teacher 2 years ago, and still recovering from it, Taking a real step back from work helps a lot. not just a vacation day here and there or even a 'long' weekend, but like 2-3 weeks or a month.

on a personal self-care level, I welcome you to try the following:

* unless you already are, **try to eat healthier**. im not asking you to completely change your diet. but try doing a 'healthy food day' once a week. As a data scientist, try logging how you feel on that day.
* **try adding some magnesium and potassium into your diet**. I know this is a bit of a weird one, I had difficulty sleeping for about 2 months, my heart just kept pounding so fast and hard while I was in bed, no caffeine for more than 24 hrs, until I saw a post about how stress causes an increase in blood pressure and cause people to burn through their electrolytes. I figured, why not? worse that could happen is it not working. I had some non-sugar sports drinks, a magnesium supplement pill, and some potassium-added salt an hr before bed. slept like a baby that night. 
* **take LONG regular baths**. not a quick 10-15min shower, but a good 30min, no phone, no screen, sit in the tub and scrub your feet and nook and cranny kinda bath. its a form of meditation and self-care. log how you feel afterwards try to do this twice a week

I urge everyone to not underestimate the importance of mental health. Society loves to treat it like its just a side-note, only the 'weak' get burnt-out or mentally ill, a rarity, an anomaly. It's not. its incredibly important to a person's well-being and more and more data is coming out to prove that it is.

"Nice visuals as the other person mentioned. But I found the actual explanation after the teacup story overall Confusing and overly compex/verbose. The teacup analogy on the other hand was very clear. 

Like are we saying the drug can only be effective if it decreased the average time by more than the 4 days go out of the 0.95? It would. Seem that's it's impossible to have any improvement unless it was 4 days or more, we would ignore all Improvements of 1, 2 or 3 days then? 

Maybe I guess we can say that on each individual result (i.e. This person lowered days to 16, but that's not enough to say it was significant) but if you're talking about 31 individuals wouldn't the probability be cumulative and thus probably goes beyond the 95% confidence? 

I get you're an author and for sure know more about it than I do. But maybe we're glancing over things that are obvious to you but not to average people like the sample size or what does the average mean on the study (if the 18 days average comes from 30 results at 10 days and 1 with 200 for example).

Fast forward one year: I am still missing something. should I go back to uni, doing the things that I loved? not that the environment is perfect, never is, but it makes me feel good even when things are hard, maybe because I feel deeply connected to the end goal.. a thing that I don't have at work. 

Find your path, but you gotta move on. Make your choice and embrace the risk, otherwise you ll always feel stuck and may end up in some depressive spiral, without even recognizing it.

Use this time to understand the things that drive you off and take a path forward to find your next spot, that'll likely wont have those.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2eTNyd2hFLVFoRGs4Q09rT2phd0M3bjF6THhXRW0wZmR0OEFXUzhWenRvVWlhVm9nUEpWSVZ0TS1aTmJGTXV0emN0czhpekpkMDFGWjJzbXpWRXF1cVE9PQ==

"Hi guys,

Those of you who are either students, or recent graduates, and working as Data Analysts / Business Analysts, - what are the top 3 most useful tools that you wish you would have learned at Uni? Is it visualisation tools like Tableau / Power BI, or SQL, or stats tools (regressions, t-tests), other?

For context: I teach the final course in Business Analytics within a MSc program, based in Australia, and would like to update it every semester to make sure the course is most useful for students. We mostly use Python throughout the course, and there's a Project as a final assessment. I'm trying to see what skills / techniques / software people would find most useful in their future jobs!

"I don't know if this is your case, but I'll share my own experience. I used to work for two companies, and my job there was quite similar. Every day, my task was to fetch data upon request and create dashboards. Before that, I worked as a programmer and only transitioned to data analysis after three years. So, getting accustomed to metrics/KPIs was challenging for me, given the numerous questions about the reasons behind these metrics/KPIs.

One thing that bothered me during that time was my lack of business knowledge, which made me uncomfortable proposing changes based on data. You know, you can't propose things that others know for sure are not feasible. Even though I had a lot of such proposals in mind.

Secondly, there was a lack of guidance. Surprisingly, both companies I worked for had only one data analyst position for the entire office. My statistical knowledge was my saving grace despite lacking business knowledge. However, it still wasn't enough to make me comfortable in my position. Instead, I always found it difficult to apply this knowledge in practice, especially without any references from predecessors' work. The projects I proposed felt very risky. You know, when you apply a predictive model to a completely new dataset and realize that your results are nearly meaningless due to missing key features, you realize that in such cases, the only thing you can rely on is business/domain knowledge. Meanwhile, all I had was statistical knowledge (statistical models and hypothesis tests) and no business knowledge (I didn't even know what margin meant).

As a result, instead of doing things that I found interesting, like design/build statistical models and making data-driven proposals, for over a year, I only fetched data and created dashboard, feeling like my job was more suited for a Data Engineer. You know, companies need to see your results, and if you want to spend time researching for your career advancement, you'll get tasks in a somehow related but completely different area. This is especially true when you don't have the experience to clearly define your job scope, and the company isn't entirely ready for that position but relies on your experience (it was my case). My experience in development helped me stay there a bit longer until I felt I couldn't learn much more.

Ultimately, I made my decision and proposed to my superior that I would work part-time and spend the remaining time on research. I believed that this would balance my current work and my future career. However, the result was not as expected, and I didn't get approval from my superior. I left the company and continued my research up to now. I focused on what I do best and traded a boring job for it. The important thing is that I still know who I am and my inclination instead of just having it nominally while completely changing the nature of my work.

You might wonder what my research is that made me make such a decision? People often say that to do well in data analysis, you need two things: statistical knowledge and domain knowledge. However, for me, this is not entirely true. The important thing in data analysis is to extract domain knowledge from the data using statistical knowledge and sometimes change existing preconceptions by observing the data itself. You can categorize user groups using existing domain experience, but when doing data analysis, you have to temporarily set that experience aside to reframe the problem based on the data and do so more sharply than your previous experience using statistical tools. My work after leaving the company entirely focused on this, and sometimes I found it challenging but never felt burned out.

Recently, I initiated a challenge inspired by my observations on data analysis, which you can check out here: [Kaggle Discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/510271) and discuss it. Maybe you'll see yourself in it.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bTdmbERLcGRjS2RHQ3o2VFNRelg0cGt5VXJwSVF6OGVqRDRSQzRzUnczTEpuUlpMT1QxRWhNTG5NczREOVlZOTZYc2M3b25OUjZEeG1NOWxpd3BLaUhrYVZuYkkxQjJkME9TQkVFR2ZROU09

"Not sure what impute mean here: (1) Replace NA with some value or (2) Remove NA row/column

If it is (2) then I dont agree with this view. There is no reason to remove data/information. If the NA is not missing at random and the NA/target is correlated then any imputing will reduce the model performance. If NA is missing at random then include that feature does not increase nor decrease model performance hence no drawback

For example: A person with missing credit rating may have higher default rate than an average person

"I am usually a very disorganized person, and I have previously felt in the problem of ""what was this code for?"" after a couple of months without using it. For me, it's a way to solve this problem.  
  
Also, the idea of the company is that, if this innovation project works fine, they want to offer it to other companies (this is, let's say, a ""pilot"" project). As you can imagine, sometimes things work fine, but most of the times we encounter different problems that takes us time until we figure out the solution. Right now, what I'm doing, is to give a general overview of the project, descript the different steps, point out problems/tasks and our suggested solutions, and also indicating which code/documents we used for each of the steps. Of course, this does not mean that we don't need to re-read and reinterpretate the code in a future iteration of the project, but I think this will save some time, for me or for anyone interested on this. 

Finally, for me is something I like to do because I would like that, if I enter a future project, there was some documentation of why things were done like this, and how where things done in general.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2Y2Rnb2tMSWNodlcxUERNMXZObHp6TzNmb291OURqZjZsZnpROTFpeGVRVlV3MXZpNHprNzZJZnJyWl95Mk9VYy1RS0xpY0VOaG9WYmhDdTZXNk91T3U3NFE3Q1owaHBkdE91V2dfV192bk09

"You know, I have been hearing this generic answer to many questions lately. That’s not how the world works. That’s not how corporations work. 
Even if you do decide to change boss, the boss’ do not roam around with their communication stats on their heads like video games. You will still be taking a leap of faith. Even if one such boss exists, they should also be willing to hire you. Even if they are willing to hire you, they should have the budgetary approvals . Even if they do have the budgetary approvals, other parameters should be a match from both sides. Even if you do end up getting hired, the boss’ attitude or expectations can change over time. Even worse, the boss themselves can be replaced by someone else in corporate restructuring. Remember, your contract is with the org, not the boss. 
This flippant answer sounds like a generic copy paste from the nutcases over at antiwork who revel in instigating others to resign. Which works from them, because most of the issues highlighted there are actually from entry level jobs, which are aplenty. 
Data science is a niche area. Data scientists are a rarer breed. Problem is, data science in and itself is not a very marketable product. It will always be used to support some business activity or other. Activity that is tied with financial goals. And the people managing those activities rarely have a technical background. Most of their exposure to data science would stem from Hollywood movies and tv shows. 
My suggestion, set some time apart with them to walk them through what is it that actually happens when a data scientist tries to service a request. Share with them your requirements that make your job easier and set expectations in advance. Reinforce it by following the set procedures. It will be a difficult journey but the rewards will be worth it.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2OU4wOHpWajlQZG51d2NleTEzamNZcWI4d1dHLUlfbTVOYkRnanBKd2F3c19neWJKTXNadEZIVEtGWjk1WXFzVlVwUWhrakRQYnk0N3NVQWlfelFBbmpEeHlIZFpaMkUwWjk4akJmZTZfZ1U9

"No one in other industries knows what NGA is/does. While you're right, satellite imagery, remote sensing, etc is huge (esp. In the industy im in....hence why I hired some NGA folk as geo data scientists)...it's still a very niche set of skills. You get job security though.

Sure...you can make the drive from the capitol in about 30min....during off rush hours...using toll roads.

"I hit a deep low couple years ago during grad school as I was starting my second job. Echoing some others here, I have to see the value in the work to be motivated by it. Working in tech the past couple years I switched more to building internal tools for my team, because I at least cared about them and not the click rates.

I blurred the lines between work and personal at my first job because it was something I was truly interested in. This lead to 90 hour weeks and of course feeling under appreciated. I took some time off of everything, whole summer I didn’t try to learn or do anything technical. Now I’m at a better balance, job and company I enjoy (took a pay cut to get out of tech). 

I have bursts where I get really interested in something, and then just lean into it and dive into a project. Then try to take time to do something else.

"Currently, I'm working as a Business systems analyst in the banking industry. I'm going to be working mainly with operational metrics using Power BI. For the past 2 years, I was employed as a Risk analyst in a tech company centered towards financial services and before that I was an financial auditor. 

Throughout my career I have worked with data and statistics in multiple ways. So far my greatest dive into Data Science was to set up a database, ticketing system, DataFlow and reporting structure for a multinational enterprise.

I have the data fundamentals cert from Microsoft, a couple of data analytics certs from CodeCademy and while I haven't taken the test, I have the knowledge and work hands on experience for the Power Bi data Analyst Associate cert from Microsoft.

I know I need to deep dive in terms of education and have been looking for masters in the area of Data Science and Analytics. Currently heavily considering NorthEastern's Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering and Colorado Boulder's Masters of Science in Data Science.

">You know, I have been hearing this generic answer to many questions lately. That’s not how the world works. That’s not how corporations work.   

That is exactly how the world works. If you don't like your job and you cannot change the things you don't like about your job, you should look for another job. No one is implying it's easy - the implication is that as hard as it is to find another job (especially one with a better boss), trying to, from the bottom up, change a bad manager into a good one is even harder. Some would argue literally impossible unless you have blackmail material on that boss.
 
>Even if you do decide to change boss, the boss’ do not roam around with their communication stats on their heads like video games. You will still be taking a leap of faith. 

And that's why you might need to do it multiple times. This is no different than dating - you don't just marry the first person you date because it's scary to take a leap of faith entering the dating pool again - yes, the dating and job pools are cess pools, but if you *know* that your current job makes you unhappy, you have to keep taking shots out there - and probably filtering better up-front. 

Especially since, as you gain experience, you also gain leverage in interviews to get more info about the company's cutlure, approach, etc.

>Even if one such boss exists

A boss with decent communication skills? Yes, they do exist. Not that rare. Great bosses are rare, but decent, competent bosses aren't.

>, they should also be willing to hire you. Even if they are willing to hire you, they should have the budgetary approvals . Even if they do have the budgetary approvals, other parameters should be a match from both sides. 

This is deliberately trying to make ""opening a job requisition"" seem complicated. It's not. Tons of companies are hiring and always will be. 

>Even if you do end up getting hired, the boss’ attitude or expectations can change over time. Even worse, the boss themselves can be replaced by someone else in corporate restructuring. 

Dope - and if either of those changes results in shittier work conditions, you should look for other jobs. 

>Remember, your contract is with the org, not the boss. 

(For the US at least) your contract is with no one - that's the beauty of at-will employment. If your job wants to keep you, both your boss, your skip level boss, the whole org, HR, and everyone else around you need to make it to where you want to work there. If any of those factors make your work experience bad, you can leave. 

I cannot emphasize this enough - you don't owe your company *shit* other than doing your job in exchange for money. 

>This flippant answer sounds like a generic copy paste from the nutcases over at antiwork who revel in instigating others to resign. Which works from them, because most of the issues highlighted there are actually from entry level jobs, which are aplenty. 

This type of mentality is what keeps all levels of workers from realizing they are all equally taken advantage of by companies. 

>Data science is a niche area. 

No

>Data scientists are a rarer breed. 

No

>Problem is, data science in and itself is not a very marketable product. 

No

>It will always be used to support some business activity or other. 

I guess, depending on your definition of business activity. Although there is R&D.

>Activity that is tied with financial goals. 

Sure, activities have financial goals.

>And the people managing those activities rarely have a technical background. 

No.

>Most of their exposure to data science would stem from Hollywood movies and tv shows. 

No.

>My suggestion, set some time apart with them to walk them through what is it that actually happens when a data scientist tries to service a request. 

The same person that mindlessly assigns you tasks with no concern for your workload is not normally a person that has any interest in being sat down and have something explained to them.

>Share with them your requirements that make your job easier and set expectations in advance. 

Again, the same person doesn't care to make your job easier.

>Reinforce it by following the set procedures. 

I guarantee there are no set procedures. Because the type of manager that has set procedures is not the type of manager that treats devs like chatgpt. 

>It will be a difficult journey but the rewards will be worth it.

I can speak from direct experience here - it is definitely a difficult journey, and it is 1000% not worth it. 

I spent 3 years working for a company where non-technical people led the Data Science team, and it was a freaking nightmare. And I worked hard to educate these people, and set up processes, and try to stick to reasonable timelines, and everything you just suggested. You know what happened? My VP committed to deploying a POC we hadn't even finished in 3 weeks - directly over christmas and new years eve break. Why? Because he wanted to look good in front of his boss and because he wasn't going to have to do jack shit for this project, so he got to enjoy it while 4 of us spent 4 weeks working 80 hour weeks rolling out a nation-wide program built on the shittiest technology stack you can conceive. 

Since then, I have only worked for companies where I felt confident that we had either a) senior enough DS leadership that I wouldn't have to worry about this (i.e., at least two levels of more senior data scientists above me, normally Sr. Director and VP), or a leadership team that could give me ample evidence of understanding that they would need to defer to me on data science topics. 

And that has worked out greats for 4 jobs in a row now.

I did a project like that recently, actually, though. I’m in finance so it was using past payment activity (and other time series predictors) to predict future payment activity. I used a time series LSTM where each “row” (it was a 3D dataset, but using row colloquially) of data was a customer time series comprised of all their past behavior (each month making a payment or not) which then predicted their next month’s behavior. And then the model was trained on all those time series. 

Because the LSTM is modeling the time series itself, you account for the autocorrelation issue. The model “knows” that it’s the same person and you shouldn’t get any bias leaking to other people. 

I think it’d be a good solution in your case as well. Pretty complicated model though, so depends on how much you’re willing to bite off. But if you’re already doing computer vision, could be an easy extension.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2UmZFdU9HVi1EWHQ3X3BBTnJzeEg4UU5wa3BjSmtDWlg4TG9pN05zSXZDUzFFTmFjN01zSmdIWVVOWFpkc0xKWEpfclhpbGh4WmphaVRHTXp4cnZmcXc9PQ==

DS team culture is good. Some people have left recently but it’s quite stable, several of the employees have been at the company for years now. Good benefits and pay, comparable to non-faang tier big tech, employees are encouraged to learn more and interact with the products that the company makes (unreal engine, fortnite, and the other games their subsidiary? studios make). Weekly play tests teams are encouraged to join in on. WLB for DS is phenomenal and afaik is still remote friendly.

New ventures by their nature are uncertain.

For my part, I've found reframing problems helpful. If someone is trying to figure what set of product features to invest in, you can answer that with descriptive inference: What features are users using the most? But, if your team was curious to try something different, you could also answer that with causal inference: What features cause a user to do more of the action that you want?

"You are projecting. You went out of your way to insult me by calling me a snowflake over the internet because I hurt your feelings. I pointed out what was wrong with the OP's choice of words on a post. Simple. Took me all of 1 minute; no feelings hurt on my end. You attacked me with Ad Hominem: the most childish form of attack. You have yet to actually defend yourself or the OP properly and I suspect that you lack the capacity to do so. Just because you say ""I am right and you are wrong"" or ""This person has the right to believe in such and such"" does not give your argument validity. Any Data Scientist knows that you support arguments through evidence: numerical or otherwise. It is apart of the scientific method.

If everyone in the sub sees a problem with OP's argument besides you, would it not be logical for you to do some introspection? Maybe this could be a good learning opportunity for you and OP.

"I don't know what field you're working in, but I think you should look for data similar to your previous work and reproduce your analysis using Python packages. That's the quickest way for you to showcase your analytical skills in a different language. If you want to expand into Python-specific capabilities you haven't explored before, web scraping is a decent example but not the only one. Instead, you could try projects in Big Data like data analysis with PySpark. Nevertheless, your analytical skills are still the most important, and choosing data that can better demonstrate that will save you a lot of time in the transition. Unless you want to do something completely new, then you should refer to existing projects with many reviews. Evaluating the scalability of these projects will also be simpler than starting a project from scratch.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3ekdmWG92Tk9qLVJEejBkeEE1UTZlQ0J4bWNTN0Z2YnNfUXNOa0F2SXA4dmplbG4ycTEzRy14Z19CRUUwQWJZWVdqd2lOYjVzaG55LWI3NlhzZGNkb3B3TVdVTEk5TmhGLWFrNzZLeUtFOUk9

"What worked for me was that I worked for a year at one team in big tech company, which was boring - same situation as you. There was career growth though. I then transferred to a more startupy team and that helped to get more motivated.   
  
More interesting projects, more ownership, more stuff to learn and obviously more straighforward career growth - you build important things, you get raised. The downside was that you also had to work harder.  
  
After honey moon period though, I still got a bit unmotivated - since I was a new engineer on that team, I would get smaller and more boring tasks and I would not care much to do them quickly enough and not do my best job basically. So, just changing the team was not enough for me to look forward to working everyday basically.  
  
Later I realized that best engineers also excel at those small, boring tasks too, earn more trust and get assigned bigger projects. So, changing teams worked, but you also have to change your mindset and attitude as well.

I've also seen the problem of boring work solved by just continuing to do what people do, but really have a great quality of life :) Weekend trips, getting food with friends each evening, rock climbing and other things engineers like to do.

"Not sure what type of projects you mostly work on want to get into it but here is what I work on at my job. Using citations(for research papers) we have in our internal database, we first scrape those files for citations within them. So say 200 internal papers/citations internally and each contains 10 references that they cite. So now we have a pool of 2000 citations, called our citation data. Next step is to establish how much of those citations are already present in the database. This is where you need NLP, rapidfuzz, or use your own text similarity algorithms. The cited papers often have slight variations in titles due to versioning, puncuation, etc. Once you've done that next step is to start building nodes/connections. Like oh this guy has cited this paper, the authors, titles, subject matters, etc maybe related for these two papers might be related. End goal is to create an LLM that recommends papers based on a given citation. 

You don't need to get to that end portion. Steps 1 and 2 are more than enough. Just basic string similarity problems like in step 2 would be pretty helpful in improving your python.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3SjFndmlNYzJobzdUWktobWM3UjNEemFiMW1UWlN5UDhkLWctRXJCNlEtdUdvazNqeE42NkFLcFhlbkdFQUt3S18waWpPLUVfU1ZqbmJ4MnU5QUJ1T2c9PQ==

My local college is offering up a data science AS degree that I'm planning on starting this fall, but I wanted some kind of experience before I start. I don't have much experience with machine learning and am kinda overwhelmed with all the options for online courses and bootcamps. Many of them are too long (ranging from 3-6 months) and I've also heard some of them can be a ripoff if you don't know what you're looking for.

"PhD in computational sciences here! with bachelor in Psychology and MS in Methodology/Statistics. I faced the struggle to leave academia, which is quite difficult sometimes, more because of the mental impact it has on your mind (changing context, role, friends, what is called the ""comfort zone"") than because of your skill set.  
  
My advice would be: don't worry, friend, and keep trying. Some companies are reticent with people who comes from academia, as you will have to prove that your expertise is related with the field. It took me lot of resumes sent to be able to get a few interviews. At the end of the day, I got what I wanted. Also, I decided to go for a junior/medium data analyst role, instead of data scientist or data engineer. I think I have background to be data scientist and some notions of data engineering (few), but I preferred to be humble, go for a job with ""less requirements"", and then start climbing from there, when I have at least one year of experience and I can refine my skills with real examples. 

My case, also, is from Spain. I guess that, if you are from the US, you will have the enormous advantage of English being your first language, which is the thing that, at least here, open most of the doors. Also, try to keep doing some courses to keep your resume updated, maybe you could try Datacamp or something. But, most important: persist!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VzZsRG02UzczdnhDbmptRUM4S3NaSkw4TDRidFdTeTZxWVRKYmhWeGVZUjNqRHBycE9lNnRHLWtfdTVqNlc2Tlp4alVyQ21tU1I3UklQRUNxSkZBQ3otbFB3emFEV2lCWFNneU80RFpOXzA9
"Data Science has become very broad. In some applications, data science has commoditized and is something you mostly do using specific software tools, like Microsoft BI, Tableau etc. Although you no doubt can do such jobs, I expect many hiring managers to reason that you are overqualified and therefore if hired would look to find a better job and therefore risk leaving. This isn't very pleasant and is known to happen to those of us who have a PhD and then look to pivot into another field.

Ideally, you would look at Data Science roles that are more quantitative, perhaps where you run experiments as well. In some cases people may specifically look for DS with PhD, so add such search terms as well. Finance or some types of hardware engineering might be candidates. 

Machine Learning is getting hotter and it still requires a fair bit of coding. I think you would have no problems learning how to deal with ML, showing that you are fluent in some standard tools and frameworks is an easy-to-measure quality that stands out in the 2-3 seconds of CV scanning you typically receive. Investing a few hours into some ML/AI Coursera certificates could help (I am sure that with your background, these should not be too challenging).

Otherwise, keep rolling the dice to drive up the base rate. The job market is not working that well generally. The silliest reasons are far too often used to either hire or not hire a person. Having a connection at the company you apply to goes a long way. It is weird that still is the case, but it is.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3UG5nN2EwdzhuaDJOSW5JY29wWURNLWRERkZRTUhTNW9neDdjV0xjWXpuMU5qT0h2VGRDQlU5cE9ZQ2dNOFJnSEdvVGFpSFFkNGd5dUhHMFI4Ykt6MlJlWnd0aldNenkzYmRnVGpJcTVGaVE9

"Academia has a tendency to make you feel like you need to be laser specialized in order to land something. You feel like you don't have enough ML to be a data scientist. You program, and use SQL and spark, but you're worried you don't do it data scientistly enough. Honestly, you're overthinking it.

Here is the deal with industry. You get the job first, and then you learn how to do everything. It's not a grant proposal. What you're going to find is that the challenge of the job isn't highly technical. It's mostly communication. You may have some hyperspecific packages you need to learn here and there depending on what you're doing, but what it comes down to is accurately listening what your boss/client wants, doing what's best for them, and then showing them what you did in a way that they can understand. The tools you use to get there are sometimes very specific, but none of them are hard, especially to a hard science PhD.

"I will not pretend to have one answer to rule them all. But here is my reasoning for why they might to some degree.

There is a theory of why education helps with employment that is *not* what most overeducated people like to hear, and that is that education is a *signal* for being a person of sufficient intelligence, diligence and character. The *signal value* of a degree from Harvard, Oxford or Stanford is itself high since those institutions are understood to enforce some standards and create high-value networks. An extremely smart person, but with a degree from a no-name university may be as smart or smarter than a fancy degree person. Yet, if I had to bet on career prospects, the high signal value school will count for a lot.

This is all to say that my assessment is that the OP has the skills to do data science work. What may be lacking are signals to that effect. It is too late (and expensive) to go back to Harvard, so to speak. Rather, the Coursera certification can signal interest and desire in the field. The person screening the CV does not have to understand that having solved large systems of differential equations numerically for a condensed phase (to take one possible topic in computation physics) makes a person able to solve for principle components of products in online shopping carts. The case I am making is that signals matter. Knowledge without signals attached does not help in the early stages of the hiring process (in the latter parts, raw intellect matters more).

There are exceptions of course. In the small companies I have worked for and hired in the past, I was often the first to read CVs, and I am technical. But one thing that happens as large companies scale is that they offload the technical staff from early hiring decisions. So smaller companies may be easier to get to with non-standard signals.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NzZINmVDWGxlZTNOUnE5NE45MFU5LTItMVpGSy03T0tIbjhHTXNGM3VDT2VXOUhKN0Q5V2JNYVE4UVRnSkItdWxmYldsbUFnZlFZTElaVzRqMDNzeTBMTWtRcDk4bEt6TUhMQ1NYMk9VXzg9

"I have a PhD in computational solid mechanics and I can tell you it is not that you lack experience. 

I am 99% confident is how you market yourself when you apply for these roles. It starts from writing your CV and how you talk about your projects.

This is a completely different world from academia. If you go to an interview and you talk about your experience the same way you present your work to other academics, you will most likely lose interest as the conversation naturally goes into technical details of the work.

The main thing you need to show to your potential employer is that you know how to navigate corporate environment. Here is a non-exhaustive list:
- can manage expectations
- you can be pragmatic in your problem solving approach (people from academia need to learn this!)
- understand how to talk with different audiences about your work (e.g. when you are talking with non-technical managers, you don’t talk about technical details of your work, you have to effectively dumb it down and just present the key findings)
- Not come across like “knowitall”. again this is from personal experience from feedback I have received about myself and what i have noticed working with other PhDs.

"This is solid advice. In behavioral health they often apply an ‘ecological’ perspective to helping better understand and improve human functioning. It’s simple and bolis down to evaluating the sum total of what we take in as a human—our inputs—which results in the quality of our output. If all inputs are negative, so are all our outputs, which might manifest in a variety of ways—insomnia, stress, strained relationships, etc. However, modify the inputs and the rest follows suit. I had to take a medical leave two months ago (best decision ever) because of burnout. Instead of staying at home and doing therapy I went scuba diving and traveled.

"Hi, hiring manager here. Of course that I can attest to my experience but while having a PhD is a big bonus, it isn’t a coincidence that it isn’t a requirement for most of the DS jobs. 
I myself have two masters and let me tell you, what we call research is very disappointingly different from what they call research in academia. In a startup you have to be able to move much faster and do incremental progress on a weekly basis. You have to be able to work with people, treat them with respect and work together towards a shared goal. 
Math - as a Physics PhD I am sure you have enough knowledge about theoretical concepts in differential calculus. That’s not what we do. We need to know enough math to read papers and to make sure we don’t do gigo, but not much more than that. 
We had a PhD person who was a dick and it was a chore working with him. He was fired quickly.

Also check the job posting to see if they mention specific things and try to have those in resume. Again I wouldn't lie but if job talks about making regressions and you know how to do that list it.

The reason for this is most of these resumes go through some screener that tries to figure out how good of a match you are. Until you get through this you won't even talk to a human.

"You are a computational physics PHD, the question is not whether you have the technical chops, its whether you can handle business problems. Frankly a majority of job descriptions are just badly worded requests, and you quite often have to figure out what the real problem is yourself (even if you get a job)

These are the skills you have: 
- Research skills
- Analysis skills
- Coding and Stats skills.

The first 2 matter more than the third, *on average.*

Many firms who have DS roles don’t have the infrastructure to actually enable the work that needs to be done. They want to get somewhere, and “DS, ML, AI, GENAI” are the magic words to get there.

To take a liberty and generalize, theres roughly 3 rough issues / Niches.

1) Basics: Someone wants a DS team, or ML magic. Someone is needed to translate ambiguous problems, and make headway towards some solution from really, really basic start points. Most of the time, you will go to making dashboards.

2) Data engineering. The firm is slightly mature and is actually looking to set up data pipelines, automation and the like. Also time will be spent on dashboards.

3) ML Models: There is enough data to actually do predictive analytics and the rest. Also time will be spent on dashboards.

The further you go from Tech, S/W, etc. the less infrastructure will be “baked in”. So its safe to say that most firms are dealing with issue 1, and simply do not have the data to do DS. 

Your CV is doing the job of saying 2 broad things:

1) Notice the PHD> I know stats

"Great question. A few ways to inject into your narrative:

1. Highlight joint work and outcomes on resume

2. In cover letter, emphasize teamwork and outcomes

3. In interviews, highlight your contribution to a team and outcomes achieved. You want to balance your ego here -- your contributions were critical, but you didn't do it all alone. It can be any domain-overlapping team -- hackathons, group projects, research with coauthors, etc.

Key term is to emphasize -- not replace fully -- individual contributions. You want to show you got the stuff and can walk the walk too, but that's a hurdle to clear instead of winning the overall race.

You want to give the impression that you're not some monk living in an ivory tower but that you can talk with people (not down to people) and that you can get tasks delivered that solve the problem.

"I transitioned to data science after a postdoc (theoretical math) 8 years ago. The market was a lot hotter then. One of the problems you're facing even if you don't know it is that there are people who got laid off from Google and Facebook. I certainly would interview you first, but I'm an oddity in this field; most people are going to go with ex-Google or ex-Facebook.

There are two skills that you haven't likely needed to develop as an academic: lab data is, I assume, relatively clean. Real world data is a disaster. How things are collected over time isn't always consistent, fields might come and go, how things get labeled by humans isn't always consistent. There are always major data issues that need to be worked through to make something work.

The other skill is more of a soft skill thing: communication with software engineers and product/project managers (depending on whether you're working for a software product company or as a consultant). It takes some time to understand what the needs and goals of these roles are and how to communicate and collaborate usefully with them. And also to understand when they're great at their job and when they suck at it and how to work within each of those scenarios.

As far as concrete advice: don't think that taking an entry level position is beneath you. My first role paid $75K (in the Midwest where that's livable) and the work was definitely beneath me. But I moved up quickly and have a pretty solid career to date. With your programming skills, you could also consider software engineer positions. The upside in pay is quite a bit higher, and the market might be less fucked. You might still need to start with a junior position, but you again should be able to move up quickly if you absorb what you need to know and can knock out hard problems like you're used to doing.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3cEJVZ2VmRWl5UGNzREp1ZzNQTG5TSXk1cmNsN0RIdExHRTFQa0s1RTRCc0E0S2t0eDhDV3NtQlF3Z2FKSVFIV05GR1VKRXdIWmtiUnNUTmg1RG1Hamc9PQ==

"My advice is get your resume perfect, then get those application numbers up and get some interview practice. Once you’ve put in a couple hundred apps you should have some interviews. 

You’ll likely fail your early interviews but you need to get the bad interviews out, so to speak.

"> maybe 40

Sadly, you gotta pump those numbers up, those are rookie numbers in this racket. There are way more entry-level applicants than there are jobs for a few reasons (over-hyped, over-sold by MOOCs/bootcamps/private universities, over-hired during the pandemic, RIFs post-pandemic). Thousands of applicants for an entry-level data science or data analyst position has become the norm without much advertising or active recruiting.

Are you looking for any kind of visa sponsorship? At this time, that is generally an auto-filter for entry-level tech roles.

Are you networking? If you can go to meetups and you have enough knowledge (and presentation ability) to demo something like ""a deep learning network for predicting position in n-body systems"" with enough accessibility that the audience is engaged a lot of them would probably be blown away. There's many relatively unskilled participants in these groups and their might be competent practitioners who are really curious about the physical sciences. There's also recruiters and employers at these events. Audiences are bigger at conferences but it's harder to get a speaking role. Make real social relationships with recruiters, too. Don't just connect because they're a recruiter, try to strike up real conversations and relationships and even see if you can offer a couple candidates for their open roles.

Carpet bombing applications and networking will NOT guarantee success but they're the two most obvious routes to look at.

Keep it simple, remember that a computer will be the main reader, and if you can, use AI to try and customize the resume you're sending to get direct matches between the position listing and your resume.

"You could absolutely get a job as a data scientist, analyst, or software developer.
Targeting algorithms engineering, machine learning, and other more specific roles is likely going to get more bites on the software side.  
      
You also might be surprised at how many physicists work at financial institutions. If you can tolerate being around money guys, then consider broadening you search to investment firms, hedge funds etc.    

Being a contributor to a FOSS project is great. Having a portfolio of stuff people can actually see is a great benefit these days.  
     
Try not to get too discouraged, the job market is way more rough right now than a lot of people want to admit. Everyone has to project an air of success, so a lot of companies just keep positions open with no real intentions of filling those roles. 
The problem of so-called ""ghost jobs"" has been getting noticed since at least 2022, I've read that a survey of hiring managers had ~40% of managers admit to posting a ghost job for various reasons. Even still, lots of postings stay open after the role is filled, via oversight or laziness.   
    
Even software developers with years of experience are having to send out *hundreds* of applications and get single digits of responses back.

"Ehhhhh, that’s a stretch. Businesses are not jizzing themselves over AI because it’ll create an equivalent number and equally paying variations of new jobs to the ones it replaces. 

Businesses want to profit, and to profit they must eliminate expenses. They will use AI to cut jobs and will work extra hard to make sure they aren’t supplanted by other jobs that pay the same and are in the same quantity. 

There will be a net loss of opportunities for humans to make livable wages as has been the case throughout history with regards to technological advancement. 

What more often occurs is that with higher productivity comes theoretically higher surplus of resources. In turn, more humans are born to infest this planet. With more humans comes more demand, so the remaining human jobs that serve humans pick up clients or become more numerous (look at how many Starbucks exist in a given square mile). Doesn’t mean people get paid more to make coffee and give massages. Just means more coffee shops and massage parlors on every corner. No replacement for decent paying white collar work that was eliminated. 

And before anyone comes in with, “qUaLiTy Of LiFe ImPrOvEmEnTs,” nah bruh. That surplus of resources is not distributed equally nor is the access to technology.

LLMs are great for writing test cases. If it writes the tests 50x faster, even if they're less accurate and more janky, you can reasonably get WAY more tests in and have better code coverage.

I’m not sure what the world would need to look like for the bears here to change their minds. The goalposts keep shifting and it’s more than a little funny to see it happening in the one place you’d expect to see more sober minds prevail.

"As someone who went through that:

The difference between job satisfaction and burnout is not normally the type of job, it's mostly the team/company culture. 

And to be clear - there isn't just ""good"" and ""bad"" company culture. Everything is a trade-off.

So, for example - my first job had great work-life balance. In turn, it felt like nothing that we were working on mattered that much and everything was super slow. So I got burnt out from *not* getting enough done. My second job had terribly work-life balance but I pumped more work out in those 3 years than at any other point in my career. So it was like running on adrenaline - it's exciting to work 60 hours week but also put out a bunch of stuff out into the world. But then I got burnt out from getting *too much* done.

Another example: I had a job where everyone was expected to be a hands-on worker. There was no ""leadership"" in terms of people who just manage - everyone needed to be able to model, code, etc. When I first joined, that sounded great because I was leaving a job where management was explicitly disincentivized from doing hands on keyboard work (which, again burnt me out). And for 2 years I enjoyed it. And then I realized ""man, I'm getting old - I don't want to code every day"". And started getting burnt out.

I know people don't like to hear this, but you need to try other jobs, do your best to filter during the process, and keep trying until you find a job that fits what you need. And be prepared for ""what you need"" to change every couple of years.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3S0NwQlllU215TGVxZVM1U2FNYzBBQk5jTk1QTmg5ZnVXVUFmRV81YmxmQ0I4XzRiQmpDZ05mSExtU2Y1Q19xNUptMHlOMHFXY0IxbUFkdlZLRm9WVWc9PQ==

You know what else, so far the source of the petabyte claim is from a single website (that I shall not link or name), and I have yet to find the methodology. (perhaps its there, somewhere). 
Heck, do you own that site or have something to do with it? (that would actually track).

> I dont have to help you become better, and frankly i dont really want to.

Maybe you thought that was a mic drop moment, but its just makes everyone think ""Please, please dont help me"" and that you definitely have communication issues.


PS: For anyone else who comes here and wants to gain something useful:

- ML/AI implementations have a HORRIBLE success rate. 

> A sober analysis of AI in business contexts, however, reveals a story that may at first seem at odds with the headlines. According to McKinsey, only 15% of businesses’ ML projects ever succeed. Another study by Gartner found only 53% of AI projects ever make it from prototype to production. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/04/10/why-most-machine-learning-applications-fail-to-deploy/?sh=1f920f98736d

And thats if you get to AI/ML. Which presupposes you have clean data in the first palce.

Data transfer and controls are inherently a political issue, as much as its nice to think of it as just engineering.
Good data flows move decision making power across a firm. Most ERP implementations fail (75% according to Gartner)

"I definitely remember having trouble interpreting and trying to explain shap values to others but once you figure it out you’ve got a workflow you can use them for most machine learning models and most of your ML explainability needs. Whether that’s variable importance, understanding what relationship your model is attributing to a feature and the response, interaction effects, etc. I find shap values make explaining a model substantially easier and quicker to code up compared to any other ways I’ve seen. Having the ability to explain individual predictions can be essential in highly regulated environments where the decision you make based on a model could be challenged by a customer and you need to be able to explain exactly how you/your model came to the decision you did.

"ITT: People completely missing the point that AI rapidly improves and will very rapidly be able to do things that it isn’t able to currently.

The short answer is that nobody knows what the future holds. AI can’t fully replace data work right now, and it may be anywhere between a few years and a few decades until it can.

But one thing that is certain is that AI will automate many of the parts of the job that are less subjective. Meaning that if 75% of your job is writing code and 25% is communication, and AI can replace the calculation part… all of a sudden, aggregate demand for data scientists drops by 75%. Large teams will be downsized, and certain responsibilities that currently come under the banner of “data scientist” may be outsourced or folded into other roles.

Or, none of that may happen any time soon. But people miss a lot of these critical details when giving a simple yes/no answer.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eXpwUVdkT0tiU3VZVVREVnJ6aDFwbkxGUkR2bkRrM1R1bTNRNnYtUG9oWXV3V0dFZGpyZnAwajVlVVVVcHNHYW1tck1PR1hnajdGMUpodGNaRkNRU3lLeW0zczI4RzlmUVR3N0xZVGJkQTA9

"While I mostly agree with you and upvoted your comment, I don't think using zero shot classification for labeling unlabeled data is particularly useful.

Because either you're having to manually check the output, gaining nothing in terms of productivity, or you're blindly trusting the classification.

If you're blindly trusting the classification you don't need to train a model after, you can just use the LLM to run predictions on new data, so the labeling becomes moot.

Sure, you could manually label a small portion of the dataset so you have a performance metric for the zero shot classification, but that performance is unlikely to be good unless you're working with a very generic NLP problem.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4MEJBbWxkWmZjbE45MUJaQmluZDhPV3Z0cnBoTVdLdURiRnBpSVFYMlZkY0phdVJrV2Rad0Q3YVB5dnM2aER4dEFLNUpwdEVRYUxyY0JvVUhCOTdCN0E9PQ==

Even a single, 3 deep tree with 8 nodes is too much for the bulk of business stakeholders so...

I just tell them ""I'm using AI to make money, these are the top 10 variables that are useful for making predictions"" and that's good enough.

I’m currently employed in the tech industry as a data analyst, but it's not my dream role. I'm looking to explore new opportunities in this field. With a strong background in financial analytics and 8 years of experience, I bring a wealth of knowledge and skills to the table.

"I have a family member who is a professor, and we often discuss the differences between academia and the real world. In academia, you are expected to continuously learn and eventually teach, with the expectation that you should know everything to avoid being looked down upon. However, in the real world, employers value someone who is smart enough to admit what they don't know and willing to learn. 

In the job market, once you know enough to avoid major mistakes, you are considered qualified. You continue to learn and improve on the job. As you become proficient, you are promoted to more challenging roles because it's difficult to find someone who can handle them. Since you already understand the company culture, it's easier to train you on what you don't know than to find an outsider who might not fit in. This cycle of promotions continues until you reach a point where you can't perform a task, which is rare if you are truly intelligent.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4STJNaFdTQXNaMnEwQV9sRlEySW1VbXprUm1sWUhxMXk5dEpqV0dSREl6eUc4RXhsekhaS0dmTFlOa2RJVEowSXo1cmd1LXc0OWxYMU1ycGdkaHE0RUE9PQ==

"I was in the running for a junior DS position earlier this year before even finishing my bachelor's.

"I never prepared data structures for DS interview. I always personally felt those are questions for CS developer. Eg: as a DS I would be utilizing Python sorting function rather than writing a sorting code on my own. Got few rejection after technical round due to me not solving data structure questions but moved on. I touched mostly easy of array & strings and few medium ones in leetcode. 

My experience in technical round was mostly SQL questions, 1-2 Python questions and then data science questions. Few had take home, few were live where they gave data and asked me to show my approach to data analysis in Jupyter notebook. These interview mostly ended with discussion of which ML approach to use and why ? Couple had a hypothetical data science scenario and asked me to lay down my approach to the problem. Prepare for some common behavioral questions too.

DS field is hot and actively changing. With LLM’s now almost in most jobs employer wants a DS with 2-3 yrs of LLM experience. But think as an employer wishlist.

"My first job out of grad school was a senior level position in ML, and I had never even touched SQL or spark. I've been working in that and similar positions for years now, and I still look up basic commands every time I use either of them. As long as the work gets done, that's enough familiarity with the technology.

When I get a new hire, I have to handhold them through learning the processes we go through at the company... how do we do pull requests, how do we make things run on the cloud, etc. That is the kind of stuff that's different at every company. You will definitely be learning those things on the job.

When a new hire says ""my sql is bad, how do I even start this?"" or ""how do I connect to github?"" or ""how do I configure a python environment?"" None of these are problems. I help them get started, then turn them loose to work on it and look things up. That ""using them on a regular basis"" step is exactly the part that you will learn on the job.

What does piss me off is if when new hires can't understand what I want them to do, don't ask questions, and just end up getting nothing done. That is almost always due to them worrying that I will discover that their skills are not already perfect. Another related problem is if they don't understand the business needs behind what we're building and end up making something complicated but useless-- this is also due to lack of communication.

The way that we try to screen for this in interviews is by talking people through coding problems. Are they asking about the constraints? About how we want to receive the results? Or are they just making assumptions, running into a wall, getting stuck, and berating themselves or giving up without asking the interviewer for help? This is how you prove you have the communication skills-- discuss coding problems with interviewers not like it's an exam in school, but like you would with a real problem on the job.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4THhIZnpXZWZIWXdSSTNjNlB2LTNSQm4zQ0RPVlI0MHlOY2I4UWxIaWw4d1hwS3VKcEJIWmFQZTVURW9RejRDSTl4d1o3Y29jQlFhSTE4Z1NaSE5faGc9PQ==

"Not DS, but in Bioinformatics. Still relevant as there's a lot of overlap.

No.

However, ""AI"" (wish we could call it something else) tools will enable some people with no technical skills to do ""analysis"" (and have no idea what they're doing) and spit out ""answers."" Businesses will often just use those, until they get bitten in the ass by edge cases, non-performant code (if it works properly at all), lack of consistency, and lack of ability to explain how their solutions were found to stakeholders.

Data scientists will end up having to check this kind of work, which will often take just as long as doing it themselves, and will have to redo a lot of things. Best case scenario involves Data Scientists being more productive when the powers that be understand this, but there's going to be a lot of push to just ""ask chatGPT"" in the short-medium term.

"Research the company on Reddit, Glassdoor, and Blind. You should not trust blindly what the hiring managers and HR tell you about culture, WLB, etc.  Ask about delivery expectations, what are normal project timelines, how often do you deal with fire drills. You also have to just like the people, or not. Sometimes you just don’t get along with people, no reason behind it. If you get that feeling and have options, feel free to reject offers that are in that category.

Edit: Also, with regards to your earlier post, a lot of this work stuff is just reaching out and making friends with people, asking if they have time to hang out after work, or helping/asking for help. Corporate culture is something that is quite similar to clubs at school mixed with cliques at school. That’s the main way to navigate it. There is no secret language secret sauce, it’s just people and you gotta make sure they like you, or you at least stick with the ones that do. All comes with experience; if you are struggling, keep trucking along and try new things when you’re hitting a wall.

It's just not reliable information.

">I get the impression that they don't want you to learn things on the job, they want you to already be familiar with the technology

Yes, this is generally the case. Executives are using the bad economy as an excuse to dump unnecessary pressure and manufactured urgency on middle managers. They need to hire people who can do the job on day 1. 

I'm a senior DS who transitioned from a PhD in comp bio several years ago. I can tell you from my experience a PhD in quantitative field != data science experience. These days you need to know a lot of tools and platforms for things like pipelining, orchestration, MLOps, cloud, dashboarding, etc. In addition, a lot of DS roles require you to manage non-technical stakeholders which almost always requires some level of domain knowledge and experience making McKinsey-style decks. A lot of teams just don't have the time to train you or to wait for you to learn these things. Besides, it will be VERY painful if you jump into a role with no knowledge of the tools or domain and have to face presenting your first deliverable to senior stakeholders in a few days.

With the available talent on the market, companies can just hire someone with years of experience in these things rather than a fresh PhD who may be very bright but hasn't used the day-to-day tools. Not trying to be discouraging; you are more than likely fully capable of learning all of these things. It's just not a good time to be looking for an entry-level DS roles because there is so much pressure to deliver and so much available experienced talent on the job market at the moment.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4eEVkMFptcnBQVHd0LU85ZjJmOTdFSVBtamZTTHFNLTNrVzhFbThwVXNIOGg5cUZfTHBxVGlXMmxtb2F3UkhNbHN3UnFsYXlvSjhiZW9kNWF1T3RqblE9PQ==

Typically those programs are a mix of tons of things without a clear direction and professors belong to other departments, not to wherever the DS PhD is hosted in.

"I'll assume you're not talking about technical interview questions which the applicant fails to answer. 

Although similar to those lines, I'll typically ask a candidate to explain a really simple concept to a layman (e.g., ""what is a standard deviation?""). If you can't effectively explain a simple technical concept in terms understandable by a nontechnical audience, then I'm not interested in having you on the team. It's not what you know; it's how you communicate what you know. 

There's also some organizational fit questions where there aren't necessarily right answers, but they're definitely wrong answers.

"SOME of these are being slowly automated though.  For example at my wife's school she orders lunch, and a robot delivers it.  Nothing real fancy, but that does replace a job.  There are robots mowing lawns and mopping floors.  These replaced jobs many didn't want to do anyway, so it wasn't as much of a replacement as a cost savings to those who needed that service done.  We do have lots of big industrial robots doing things and have been for decades, but those are very repetitive tasks.

What we need is the robots that are doing unique tasks and figuring things out or working in unique situations.  For example there isn't a lot of reason why we do not have robots that could build a house, and build them much better than the folks that do not (at least in the USA, especially here in TX).  These will not be a hardcoded thing of doing A-B-C, but will need to work with each other, following a blueprint, being able to work together, and that sort of thing.  

Replacing folks at mcdonalds with robots like the boston dynamics ones, tied with AI to do their jobs and work together, as well as taking an order, is coming, and will be here within a couple decades.  This will be expedited if minimum wage goes up as in order to make more profit, they will need robots over people.  Robots can also work 24/7, never take sick days, do not need insurance, and as they become smarter they will be able to do those jobs.

"Yeah linear models are more easily interpretable, but 1. not everything is linear, 2. linear models fail when the feature size is larger than the number of samples.  An obvious example is doing machine learning from MRI images to detect diseases -- this is a nonlinear ML process.  Another example is using multimodal data like genome-wide methylation markers in combination with somatic DNA variants to make determinations of cancer status.  Another example is that people commonly use polygenic risk scores as linear models, but PRSs are derived from individual effect sizes from GWAS studies, and there's no reason to think that every variant in a GWAS acts independently of its neighbors.

"Devil’s advocate here, from the perspective of having been on both sides of these presentations. Often, the way that data scientists cite ROI or value uplift is naive at best, and worst it can offend business-side managers who understand the economics of the business and see the ROI claims as reductive. 

Not saying data science doesn’t create tremendous value. It sure does, and it should be paid and valued for it. 

But outside of some crystal clear A/B tests, the data science group won’t have a clear enough argument to make about ROI without sounding tone deaf.

"Not your job(should be your manager’s to build this case through collaboration and leveraging his/her team members), but you can potentially come up with a calculation based off of tracing your business decision all the way to where it affects customers and present it to your boss to disseminate. Depends on your industry and transparency of the teams you work in and with it may not always be possible for a junior analyst working in an isolated team.  You’ll need to potentially contact your customers to fuel the understanding to build out such metrics.

Reporting and supporting with reporting itself can be a metric though not directly attached to a dollar amount, can claim you indirectly supported the efforts of X number of employees which comprise Y% of the company as an example.  Metrics don’t have to just be dollar signs, though to less effect, with enough emphasis on the widespread impact the case can still be strong.  Again this is your manager’s job, to really put this big picture of your team’s value together and communicate it both up and down the chain.

In the end, if you can’t make a case to justify your continued existence when corporate comes knocking, you’re screwed either way. Focusing on results and impact is important for these teams, and again that’s your manager’s job to keep y’all on track and producing things the company finds value in. It’s your job to do your best to solve the problems that come your way, learn, and sometimes struggle that you alone cannot control your destiny in the company and must rely on others for advocation, no matter how talented or outspoken you are.

"It’s many, probably. Centralized data scientist structures actually are problematic in the many different functions they can need to serve, the annoying-to-other departments prioritization lists, and the specializations that they need to focus on. It may be too disconnected from actual customers to truly function well. Integrated, decentralized data scientists reporting to non-tech verticals but all bound by a central support system like a community/a central data engineering team are far more common(heck decentralized in general is far more common and often how the centralized departments even start up)

Edit: as an example, in a large company where you have whole teams of DSes supporting various functions like accounting, a centralized DS team may deprioritize the accounting team because other aspects of the company are more important. Then the accounting team fangales HR to get them a DS or DS equivalent to support their efforts and their efforts only. Rinse and repeat for the whole company. Eventually you end up with a (main) group of DSes supporting one effort and a couple unofficials supporting the neglected efforts.

"There are four major red flags that I have seen in 12 years in the industry:

  
(1) Teams which do not follow proper software engineering practices. Especially regarding code reviews, version control, unit testing and clean code principles. This is where the real disasters happen. I've seen code which is riddled with bugs and horrific errors go into production with disastrous consequences. 

(2) Team which do not validate models correctly. The impact can be similar to above, these models fail miserably in production and then require months and months of reworking. Wasting significant amounts of time.

(3) Teams which have no clear route to value. I've seen DS teams sit far too far from the business they are trying to impact. This means they develop useless solutions which go no where and therefore create zero impact.

(4) Clueless management. Often point (3) is driven by the fact that management are clueless and fail to initiate the right conversations with the business to help set up the right opportunities. These sorts of managers tend to obsess over the latest buzzwords and want useless POC's created so they can brag about how in tune with Gen AI they are to their peers.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4M213dDdFUGJBWnJELUdVcm5OdFZPek85WjRoVUN4RXdlbDRQUFBsS0R1UG9iWVZyUlBEWWJyT2FhRGJYWFUzV2huWHVqcC0tNng3QVlwQWRIMndQLVE9PQ==

"> That’s fine in good times

Yeah, this is key. In some businesses ""fancy businesses analysts"" may do extremely fancy things, like digital twins of factories or entire business processes, fancy demand forecasters, price optimizers etc. None of that is customer-facing, but it is a heart of the company.

However if the management changes, all of that can go to nothing in one day, essentially. Having lived through an extremely unprofessional merger-takeover, it is somehow super-painful. Seeing several years of tough work that used to bring real profit being ruined by unprofessional leadership, after they have fired the previous board, is quite traumatic.

"According to Gartner over 80% of data science projects fail. This raises serious questions and begs reflection on the part of all stakeholders. I will not reinvent the wheel, as you can search for the respective article, but some of the elements are:
1) Lack of clear objectives
2) Poor quality data
3) Poor communication 
4) Overemphasis on the technology side of things, in detriment of the business problem
5) Unrealistic/misaligned expectations between stakeholders
6) Lack of an iterative/continuous-improvement approach to the project and team 

Reversely..:
A skilled and diverse team, acting in a continuous improvement/iterative way under supportive leadership and well communicated business goals between relevant stakeholders, are green flags in any data science project/team.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VGJQeldXWWVCOEpWQzBzM0EtV2hNSGswS0E3MVY0d0k2MXh0ZG9yVGM5MFFQMzYteS1XWmxETmR5R3VtZkE1NWd1azVudmg4a0NGSnNZN3RnOUpFbUVKZ3BrcVlucklremd2SDhtb3VtSVE9
"Hi! I have an undergrad degree in eletronics and computing engineering with a master in mathematical economics. I work as a economist/strategist nowadays using a lot of excel to analyse economic and financial data, but I am a bit rusty on the technical side of things.

I would like to be more data driven and offer more quantitative modern solutions, both with economic data and price data, to my team. I am particularly interested in time series, the ins and outs of seasonal adjustment methods in the most important economic data (payroll, ism, cpi, pce…), how to evaluate them (were they weak, strong, their composition, their core measures, how predictive of future activity they are) and how to asses their impact on prices on release. I already do it, it is my job description, but I would like to amp it up. I am trying to switch all my spreadsheets to R and trying to do some interesting and atractive visual exploration of the data.

I would like to get better at the things described above (80%) and perhaps get a certificate on my resume that I know modern techniques(20%). The signaling aspect is less relevant because I have 15 years of experience, I am employed and I have a decent academic cv, but I would like to qualify a bit better to data analist/quant leadership positions at a big financial company.

My question is: are data science masters on gt or texas worth it to this end? I want to go through some structured learning of data analysis and econometrics (data science to learn good/modern habits and econometrics to go past OLS or at least learn to analyse its results better), but I am afraid of wasting time. I think this knowledge/approach/output would be valued by my company, and I would like to do it as eficiently as possible. I dont wanna go on a wide tangent, I would like it to be really grounded. I have kids and a full time job.

Do you have some suggestion of online resource/certificate to this end?

Thanks, sorry for the wall of text!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4TzRqYW9RQzRtSlBGVTFXRndRRUNfT2FtNFBXektZYkFXdlByRnhEZGNuREg3aUxRLWxfREcxVnVpWVFubWc1Y01JZkRyR21pNkV2cjNzYjNGUGptLWc9PQ==

"I just still find it crazy that people say they’re “learning” SQL yet proficient in C, R, and Python. SQL is by far the easiest of the four.  I feel like everyone sees only one side of C,R, and Python and claims proficiency/comfortability. 

Python has millions of packages and even base Python is infinitely complicated. SQL has three sets of functions(at least in my experience, it’s read, write/design, automate).  C is the source of many other languages and can be made to do so many things. SQL does one thing best: databases.  R is a complicated multifunctional calculator that can be adapted to do many things that Python or C can do. SQL has few flexibilities, other than integrating with lower level lanaguages, most use cases revolve around databases.

My main suspicion on this is that SQL is the least copyable and pastable language amongst these four, which is why to those who only develop surface level understanding of all these languages, it feels the hardest or most complicated to understand, since you actually need to know why and how something works rather than just a copy and paste answer.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4S0Y0Q3N3Smk1TGVCNFRnclNyLVVTYmdoYzVyY2JDT3JPTDM3MFRVSXJ4Zjk4QzM0YkgwOTNDdWs1QXNyX2J5bm8zd0s3Mm5Sb1BpNHUzSGNTQmpvOGc9PQ==

"Legal questions aside, the only problem with the “illusions of productivity” question is the difficulty of measuring the outcome in real life contexts. The fact that it’s difficult to measure does not suggest the net effect of tools like co-pilot one way or another; it suggests neither that it helps or harms. That said, anyone who requires large randomly controlled trials and Cochrane reviews to say whether something works is destined to “never knowing” whether AI tools improve productivity. 

But if one is willing to consider some of the messier and more complex data I think it can and will become clear how these tools help people in time. I don’t blame anyone for wondering where all the large signals are in the data, but its also not entirely unexpected given how it can take a lot of time to learn how to actually use LLMs. I guess to me it’s clear that the *raw materials* are all there for transformative technologies based on models like GPT4.

Label encoding maps categories to numerical values, while hashing techniques like HashingVectorizer map data to a lower-dimensional space.

Out of curiosity, I applied to some of these openings (in Europe as I live here). Out of the ones that offered me an interview (6), I asked all of them why LLM experience was a requirement, and what is the use case for it. Out of those:

- 2 wanted to ""test the usage of disruptive technologies"" (basically their words)

- The other 4 ping-ponged the question to me: ""You should be the expert. What are the use cases we should be interested in? You find out, as it will be part of your job"".

As a corp. data science division lead who often encounters young candidates in your career stage, it seems like you might be running into a fairly common issue — which is that you’re collecting internships and certifications for your resume like they were pokemon without actually learning the fundamentals, leading to challenges in completing technical skill tests.


Ask yourself this - when you’ve taken your courses do you leave them with a solid understanding of the subject or do you usually “study for the test”?  In my experience the vast majority of candidates are the latter.  If you’re in such a position then my advice to you is to refresh your fundamentals and to develop your soft skills.

If you do genuinely have a strong grasp of technical skills, then I’d still recommend developing your soft skills with the time you have left in your degree. One commonality you’ll find if you’re ever searching anything along the lines of “what makes a candidate most attractive to hiring managers” on this subreddit, is soft skills.  I promise you hiring managers are constantly seeing resumes from young graduates that are stacked but end up being a house of cards when it comes to actual capability. I have 15+ years in the field and I’ve seen resumes from graduates that are more stacked than my own with skills, but it turns out that candidates will take a 6 month course or certificate on a skillset and just confidently label themselves as experienced and proficient. Extending your degree to stack on another internship just seems like the same type of resume stacking without substance. 

If you’re on track to graduate in 3 years why are you so worried about securing a job this coming August?  You should be applying to full time positions the year prior to graduation, not 3 years ahead.

Also, while it is great that you have ambition to work at specific companies, you should also know that working for a specific company should never be the end goal.  Dream jobs are often overrated.  Instead you should focus your career search on the goals you want to accomplish with Data Science and ML.  This will inadvertently make you more valuable for ‘dream jobs’ as they will see a candidate with ambition that goes beyond simply getting a position at their company (think from their perspective, once you get the job then what?).",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MlV3bEwxVm44YUUtVmE5OEpmZEhKMGRVRnNlOHpMMjFDRERDbUVvVEdQaEdJLUVweFdYRnFHcFFkeWZSLXRqMjhwN3lDTkxuRWxkc3RFSklueTRsckE9PQ==

"Delaying graduation by one semester could not be a smart move. Whatever  time you have to intern at a larger firm, gain valuable experience, and better prepare for technical interviews. This extra preparation can significantly boost your chances of securing a job at a top company.

"I appreciate your detailed response. Sorry for the confusion; should've clarified I'm entering my 3rd and final year this fall, so that's why I'm looking for jobs this Fall. I would say that my soft skills are fairly strong; I network often with alumni and peers and I have always done well in behavioral interviews. I also believe that my technical skills in Python and SQL are fairly solid for my age, and I've always tried to get the most out of my classes regardless of the grade. I'm afraid, however, that my technical interview skills are lacking (think LeetCode, probability brain teasers, etc. ), and I would like more time to prepare for them before this upcoming season. 

You mentioned it yourself though; if I'm in such a position that I'm lacking fundamentals (which is certainly possible), wouldn't an extra semester of college and an additional internship give me the time to focus on refreshing fundamentals? I just don't see how it would be any easier to do that once I start working full-time, especially if I'm unable to land the role that I want.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cDFIMjEwTFpod0JNeVZIOWhuVmdXdVl2QjZITmFySnZVejRYdHpFcU1qdFFlenBMRmdpanlVa1hmcm51R1BvQmRTV2pfRi1wX0V3N185V0FSRS01SHc9PQ==

Basically lack of depth of really understanding under the hood of these statistical tools and ultimately improper applications of them are really common and nobody notices until a project starts having issues.

Lots of overboard tools used for problems that are much better suited to simpler methods/models and as a result much time being spent on diagnosing issues. (For example, throwing neural networks at a time series problem as the first solution.)

The toolkits people have are so vast that its often scary someone can fit GBMs without knowing what the CART algorithm is or people not knowing what generalized linear models are (but they know logistic regression).

"I'm a PhD in physics who has used ML but mostly done biostats for 20+ years.  I am deeply unimpressed with most of the intro-level books in applied stats- they usually have appalling blind spots.  While computational procedures like bootstrap and loess are gradually finding their way into such books, other central topics like robust and resistant methods still get short shrift.  More importantly, they don't teach enough about attitude, the importance of study design (S. Lazic's ""Experimental Design for Laboratory Biologists"" looks promising, but i haven't read it carefully yet), and critical thinking.  But to give you a reasonable starting point, consider Bland's ""Introduction to Medical Statistics"" followed by Harrell's ""Regression Modeling Strategies""; perhaps also Julian Faraway's books on modeling.  Then read some aticles on what I might call applied philosophy of stats, like a few I posted on another thread:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1d3mab4/comment/l6afpnu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/1d3mab4/comment/l6afpnu/)",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5b3psRElkTEFHSlFRT1lzSlpFOUNiMXliVjEyenJxbUREbk9WSDJ5a3k3a21rS20yLTZsTGVGdnJMX1k0VURvTlJmN3VfLXJjZVFENFQtUkluTlN6NHc9PQ==

2. **""Can you tell me about the team I'll be working with?""** It's great to know how the team is put together and how I might fit into the mix.
3. **""What are some of the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?""** I like to know what I'm walking into and think about how I can help right off the bat.
4. **""How do you measure success for this position?""** It's important for me to understand how my work will be evaluated and what they value most in this role.
5. **""What tools and processes does the team use regularly?""** I'm curious to see if I'm familiar with the tools they use or if I’ll need to pick up some new skills.

These questions help me figure out if the job's really the right fit for me, and they give me a sneak peek into the team's day-to-day life and challenges. Plus, it shows that I'm thinking seriously about how I can contribute to their success.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aDRnZXAzQ1dOSkx6enhRNFg2U01Oc0o2Z3hFaG9UclZsbDBwdDdaOEowLW95aXpMTnNfN2VManBJbzQ2UnNmTnJ6eHUxMVZIdXRMaDVfbU0xT0dCNUE9PQ==

"I'll be honest - i've seen a lot of statistics mishaps that had no practical effect. But I think that has a lot to do with the type of company you work for and how ""direct"" the effect of ML is.

I was just talking to a friend about this over the weekend: if you're a company like Netflix or Pinterest, where there are a LOT of segments of your business where ML is driving decisions automatically, then bad statistics can have pretty immediate negative effects on your business. 

For example, if someone configures an A/B test using the wrong statistical test, and it overestimates the performance of a feature, then you might implement a feature that starts degrading your performance literally instantaneously.

By contrast, if you work at a company where *all* the decisions are still ultimately made by people, then the margins that statistics tend to matter in don't generally end up applying - because there are so many other barriers to prevent risk and ultimately the uncertainty of the system as a whole is *so* much larger than the uncertainty of individual ML assumptions.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5MGNYNXI0YWhxWm82azN0Njltb2pXSklweVpodFR0Y0N0QjdiRzM5RTZTR1V5aFBLT2VudTdub0NfTHEtUnlRcUlWMjNycVNwQW9WT0xoeS1qRHhxbkE9PQ==

"You're getting a lot of resounding nos, but I'm not as convinced it's as horrible an idea as everyone is thinking. However your logic for why you should is bad.

These are bad reasons to delay graduation:

* give myself a chance to intern at a larger firm
* have more time to study for technical interviews

These are good reasons to delay graduation:

* in order to graduate you have to take too many classes and you will be struggling to graduate, let alone get good grades, let alone get good grades and prepare a reasonable amount for interviews
* if it's at the point where most of your graduating classmates already received a job offer and you haven't yet.

Now, the other side of it: instead of delaying graduation, you could instead sign up for grad school (given that the job market looks bad right now, punting for another 1.5 years might be a good idea + you know, getting a MS). The only catch there is that I would only do a MS if I didn't have to pay for it - i.e., a program that covers your tuition via a research or teaching assistanship (or alternatively a program with in-state tuition which makes it not terribly expensive).

"Red Flags:

* No specialization. Everyone is supposed to be able to do everything.
* Too many projects per person. Everyone is working on 4 to 5 different projects at all times.
* The most senior data science person in the company is not senior enough to have any real power (I would say for a Fortune 100 company, you need someone at most 2 levels below the CEO)
* No vision for how things *should* work. It's fine if things don't work great, but you need a leader who is constantly setting a vision for what things should look like, and striving to make steps to get there over time.
* Constantly flip-flopping in strategy. 
* No speaking truth to power. If you don't have people who feel comfortable telling non-technical, more senior colleagues ""no bro, you're off your rocker"" *frequently*, then that just means you'll eventually drown in unreasonable expectations.
* Never pushing back on timelines. I worked for a team where senior leadership love the ""how high"" approach, which always meant I got signed up to do projects in insane amounts of time. Now I have a boss that *knows* how long things take, and I have yet to get an assignment where I was like ""I can't do this"". Life changer.
* A lot of talk of being data-driven but without a process-driven culture. This is becoming more and more my mantra in corporate: if you can't describe how your current process works in an algorithmic way, the odds that data science will help you improve it dramatically are slim to none.

You don't need a company to pay for it (in fact, few companies pay for MS programs these days). Instead you can just apply to a bunch of schools and see which one offers you the best financial aid package. Schools have a range of options to help - teaching assistanships, research assistanships, scholarships, fellowships, etc.

The one thing I would say: do not pursue a MS in DS because those have huge price tags and limited financial aid. They are the MBA format of grad school.

"Fortune 100 company.

The most common problem is:

""Today, we have a process to do X that requires either a bunch of people to do it, or requires some people who are really important to spend too much time doing it. Also, it takes too long. Also, we don't do it very well because it's too hard to do consistently and we don't have good tools for doing it. We want someone to build AI that does that"". 

AI = ML, Stats, OR, heuristics, logic, whatever. 

So it could be forecasting, setting inventory levels, setting prices, adjusting prices, predicting price elasticity, optimizing allocation of inventory, diagnosing outages, have a GenAI customer support bot, etc.

So it is mostly aligned with your Example 1 and 4. 

There is a LOT of Example 2, but as you said that's normally what analysts do.

There is some Example 3, but you have to very quickly go from ""here is some data"" to ""ok what are you planning to do with it?"".

"Hello friends!

I have recently graduated with a BS in data science. After having little to no luck with job hunting in my field these last few months I am now strongly considering pursuing grad school. 

I have 4 internship experiences (no FAANG or anything crazy, but I definitely still feel accomplished) to date, all but one are highly relevant to DS/ML. Despite this I still feel I struggle to stand out amongst other talent while applying to junior level positions. As a result, grad school has been a strong consideration of mine for the last few months. However, all 4 years of my college career I have been financially independent. Due to some financial literacy and decent planning I was able to get through 2 years debt free and then finance my last 2 years myself. I don’t think I have the resources to put myself through 2 more years of college (I will almost certainly go broke). As a result the option of pursuing an MPS has become appealing. 

Requiring less time and money, this option seems to provide the flexibility I need in pursuing further education. However I do have concerns about the long term implications of such a program. 

My questions are as follows:
    
1. MS vs MPS in Machine learning: Will I be       at a disadvantage when applying to ML positions? In other words, is the MS significantly more appealing?

2. Has anyone who is reading this pursued such a program? Are there any regrets? was this a good decision for you?

3. Are there any certifications or alternatives that I could pursue they may help in achieving DS/ML positions with simply the BS in DS and my internships.

Finally, any advice is welcome here, regardless of if it’s not on this exact topic. I always appreciate guidance and would love to hear any insights you all may have. 

Thank you!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5eERrSWtZUUZ4SHZYZDg3ZmJqVVFLTnpFSnJJanFRV05iZWpITXlkdW1TclpLU25lSDQzS05VLXUwanJjVWVScjQtQV85R2ppUUcwZ29nZWZseVRldmc9PQ==

It takes some effort to develop programmatic thinking, and it can really really help the transition once he starts getting into formalized programming classes.

3. Assuming he plans to continue his education, I'd recommend majoring in either CS or Stats while minoring in the other. DS degrees are still fairly hit and miss with regard to quality, you're generally still better off with one of those two. Economics is another option, especially if you focus on econometrics. 

4. Take advantage of career fairs and career services while in college. Internships are a great way to get your foot in the door, as the entry level market is very competitive right now. 

5. General college advice: get enough sleep, take mental health seriously, choose friends wisely, and get involved in student organizations. Get to know your professors, they're not like your high school teachers. They can open all sorts of doors for research opportunities that look great on resumes.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5S3NIRTk2WmU3ZVR6V1hGQ2xNdGhCZkFscjdpaFFFcnlLTFBEaUpDU3VOM2xuMDQ0OWRtMTZ6ODBoWnc3MjB3cUN0VDRnaDNFR1NPUXdURUFqLVNKUDRRNkFHOWdLVnlyZWN2WU1mMFZqZW89

"Hey! Nice work. I've been interested in Dask for a long time but never had the chance to try it out. Could you help me with something I don't quite understand? I'm working at a big tech company, using SageMaker, and we don't have a Spark cluster at the moment. With this in mind, I've been reading about Dask to use on the SageMaker cluster/machine.

Sometimes, I need to read large Parquet files that are much bigger than the available memory. I need to manipulate them, train a model, and then apply a Scikit-Learn model to an even larger file to evaluate the results.

Is it possible to use Dask on SageMaker like a ""local"" machine? Do you know how to use Dask to apply a Scikit-Learn model to a large dataset to evaluate results? Or do you have any materials that teach this?",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5c0MyaFFDQ1p6RHkxVGh4aTlwSE5SVUNBUEhocnMzQjNJY1RyVUNlVnh1RUVqTkVBQjdwUldNNzg5VWJ3d2xuLVJscHdVdG1SWFhQUGFvQnQ0QWFfR0E9PQ==

"Hey,
I have a doubt. I have been applying for internships on various platforms but unable to get none in Data Science and Machine Learning. Let me give you guys an overview on my experience.
Background: I have been getting experience in Data Science and Machine Learning. I have learnt about Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Training and Testing a ML model, Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross Validation. I have also been working learning Deep Learning. I sometimes also feel that I lack various skills which I have to work on like Computer Vision and NLP, but can't get started.
I would like to get some suggestions on what other skills like API building, CI/CD, Docker is essential for ML. Also, want a thought on how to get aways from this stuck phase.

It might indicate that I am confused but a help would be great!

"My points was to highlight that it might not be a good idea (in case you're using regular linear regression), to include high dimensionality categoricals such as location, or ""product type"" at all, since within the different categories, the other features you are using might affect the target in different ways.

Let's say we have two products, A and B. You are trying to model the sales for the upcoming week and you are using two features; last weeks selling, and a rolling average of selling per week for the last 4 weeks. If you would include ""product"" as a model feature, the model would attempt to find a good equilibrium of weights to apply to your selling features, and explain the rest of the variance through the categorical.

However, if you train two separate models for product A and B, you might find that A is much more consistent in how it sells whereas B is more reactive. The model for product A might result in 0.9x rolling average + 0.1x last weeks selling, whereas model B could be the exact inverse. Attempting to model both of these products selling with one model using a categorical would be very suboptimal.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5UHlyNzVQdWctV1QtbmZOb0llU19MaUtpREM5MDRySld5M01TeVVrdXZ4bWhMeXo1QTQ0MGdiaWxtTmRGVXF3VVVFalBHWnBLd2t5Z1laazhINnI3cmc9PQ==

Some places prioritise having a person that doesn't talk bullshit.  Not many though, as such people often micromanage.  But some teams have a strong technical culture, and a non-technical leader would not build a good rapport.

"I second u/fishnet222 's recommendation of math + core CS/DS classes. 

It is also good to think about what kind of job you want to do. CS/DS is being increasingly specialized and there are several kinds of roles. There are different strategies to optimize for each position.  

There is data engineering that focuses on frameworks/architectures for collecting and managing data; ML engineering is similar but focused on building scalable machine learning research, tools, and production-ready code. A data science or computer science degree may be optimal for these kinds of roles.  Then there are roles for bioinformatics/statisticians, which would be more suitable with a math degree. There are research roles that generally require a PhD (or equivalent work experience in research). Generally, research focuses less on hardcore programming/software engineering and more on experimentation (depending on where you go). Depending on the research, the math degree may be more beneficial here.

There's ""data scientist,"" which is a loose term that everyone defines differently. Could be any of the above. Often, I see positions looking for a ""jack of all trades,"" usually in startups or smaller academic groups. 

Then there's the domain you want to apply this to. Finance, biotech, etc. I know that there is a demand for highly skilled people who can understand both biology as well as math but can also program. If you meet that niche intersection, you should be well set up to either get into a PhD program or a research-related role in industry. 



I would also highly recommend internships. Do one every summer and try to find a research lab to join during the school year. Biology labs love having CS people joining, but can be tricky because if the lab doesn't have strong expertise, you may not get the best mentorhsip.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5b0J0WWpWTE5FNUFkcDdaaWVXbENzWmFac3BrVG53Zl9OcnRxS1ludWljLWk3elZiX3pEVWd2SE9zWDhBeDRENFM4SGk3ZUE2NHY0X2liaWU5RHNqSlE9PQ==

We'd go through it on our own, I put together a shared google sheet with the topics of the section and people could put in what they wanted to discuss about the section on the sheet. Then when we met for 'book club' we'd go through and discuss what was in the notes.

I recently graduated with a degree in International Relations (IR) and will be starting my master’s program in IR this September. I am interested in pursuing a career in data analytics and have some questions about integrating IR with data science.

I am considering writing my thesis on the application of data analytics in the IR field, with a focus on security, international politics, or international trade. I am curious about your experiences in data science as it relates to IR. What should my priorities be as I transition into this field?

"As the other comments have said ""Data Science"" programs can be quite garbage (take this from someone who has a degree from one of these programs).

When I work with students in these programs, they all want to throw every statistical idea at the wall and see what sticks. It is often overlooked that the vast majority of business data problems can be solved with a simple bar graph in excel.

There will always be a use case for the more advanced stuff, but in my experience it is quite rare. Being able to take complex problems and provide simple solutions has done more for my career than lengthy statistical analysis in R.

"My work is in dynamic pricing algorithms which usually is an OR field. The bulk of how the dynamic pricing algorithms work is really based around optimization and how you defined the problem / objective function (this is the OR piece that's very important). In that optimization are model forecasts as inputs so the ML piece is really focused on demand models and models used in the objective func. This is really common in supply chain and logistics DS roles as well.

"Well sure for a recent graduate.  A research PhD is a job after 1st 1.5 years, working semi-independently.

Masters programs take money from students, Universities make profits from it.  They will be less selective.

PhD students specifically cost universities money, specifically to a grant funded dissertation advisor. 

If you earned money working in a competitive environment for a professor who has options to hire, and succeed at creating something significant and novel through numerous years, that's a reasonably reliable signal of capability.

And then there's the other signaling effect that the standard for being admitted to research PhDs is much higher than many masters programs---because of course PhD students immediately cost money and time and the hiring professors only want those who will help and contribute above their burdens.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5ZTVvZU9EOEsySmVyZWVpMWo5eXBDU3FUUW5BVlJnNDNGZGpJSDd3VlEzZHJrSjVrZ0xPNkphbzZ2RjJOQmJWcmVvX0dTMmpZUWVESDZJcHg3SmJZYlE9PQ==

Also briefly covers Simpson's paradox and regression to the mean, topics often ignored entirely.  Extremely limited discussion of robust estimators.  Nothing on experimental design, bootstrap, cross validation, scatterplot smoothers, density estimation, etc.  You will still need another book to get broader coverage of regression models including logistic regression, Cox regression, mixed effects, and so on.

"I have a social science undergrad degree, and to me, social sciences teach you how to approach problems and how to structure answers.

Plus, I find these folks tend to be better at thinking through the theory behind a question and applying methods based upon what's actually needed rather than because it's their favorite widget (at least compared to some CS/dedicated DS degree folk I've worked with).

"Data Scientists analyze and model data to find insights and predict outcomes across various domains. They often explore datasets and build algorithms without a specific business decision in mind.

Decision Scientists, however, use data with a clear focus on supporting specific business decisions. They’re more involved in creating actionable insights, setting up experiments like A/B tests, and directly influencing business strategies.

"Both degrees you’re considering have their own merits and can lead to exciting opportunities. Let's break down some of the key factors to help you decide:

# Mathematics:

1. **Foundation**: A rigorous mathematics degree provides a strong theoretical foundation that can be invaluable in various fields, including data science. The courses listed, such as Measure Theory, Complex Analysis, and Numerical Methods, offer deep insights into the fundamentals that can be applied in advanced areas of AI and data science.
2. **Flexibility**: With a solid math background, you can branch out into diverse roles beyond data science, such as quantitative analysis, cryptography, actuarial science, or academic research.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Math trains you to tackle complex problems and think abstractly, skills highly valued in top tech companies and research institutions.

# Data Science:

1. **Applied Focus**: This degree seems designed to give you practical skills directly applicable to the field of data science and AI. You’ll learn about data structures, algorithms, and specialized topics like machine learning, which are crucial for modern data science roles.
2. **Specialization**: The option to specialize in your final year allows you to dive deeper into a specific area of interest, whether that’s AI, bioinformatics, or another domain. This can be a significant advantage when targeting roles in these fields.
3. **Employability**: Data science is currently one of the hottest fields with a high demand for skilled professionals. Having a degree explicitly in data science can make you a strong candidate for roles in this rapidly growing sector.

# Considerations:

* **Career Goals**: Think about the kind of projects and companies you aspire to work with. If you see yourself more on the research or theoretical side, a mathematics degree might be more appropriate. For more hands-on roles in AI, big data, or data-driven decision-making, the data science degree could be a better fit.
* **Learning Style**: Reflect on whether you prefer a more abstract, theoretical approach (mathematics) or a practical, applied learning experience (data science).
* **Market Trends**: Currently, data science skills are in high demand across industries. However, strong mathematical expertise is always valued, especially in roles requiring advanced analytical capabilities.

Both degrees can lead to exciting and lucrative career opportunities. If you're leaning towards solving real-world problems using data, the Data Science degree might be more directly aligned with your interests. If you love pure mathematics and want a deep theoretical understanding with the flexibility to apply it in various domains, the Mathematics degree could be more fulfilling.

In the end, consider what excites you most and aligns with your long-term goals. Both paths can open doors to working on interesting projects at top companies.

Basically the goal is to blend elements of PyTorch with LLMs to create prompting pipelines that are self-improving without ever writing a single prompt (this idea has become very popular in the past few months but this package was working on that problem long before).

One of the researchers created a pipeline that could do text classification with over [10k different classes](https://x.com/lateinteraction/status/1752020758971437240?s=46&t=Sfyn0fYB_7h9jFWWL6MHiw).

The package has a bit of a learning curve but it’s the real deal and many people who use it swear by it as the post-Langchain method of building LLM pipelines",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6MWRQSGVqODZVREp1RHpUU0JsdVFLNEU4dG9OSU5oNHVma24zN1RpSHhpWWdUMDNreUd6ckMxZ3JnMlBSYXg1S1U4d0VqdlZqVS1sZEQtYUdXbFR0X1E9PQ==
"I was referring to both, but of course I'm limited to just what I have experienced. My biggest concern with the programs is it is one thing to learn how to create a model, but it is an entirely more difficult challange to know when to create a model, and I feel that second part is where schools tend to flop. Let me give you a real example from my experience:

I was tasked to make a product recommendation model, and I remembered back at school we learned about the Apriori algorithm and how that is exactly what Amazon uses for their recommendation engine. So great, I set out to implement Apriori, I created all these indicators for demographics and whether or not the customer bought product X, and I got some results. But here is the issue. My company only offers like 6 different products. I know now that Apriori doesn't work in this scenario because there isn't enough predictive power in just the 6 products and for the most part they are all quite independent and the average customer only buys 2 of them so the cross sell data is quite sparse. Combine all of this with the fact that these products have a defined order in terms of profit (Product A is more profitable than Product B is more profitable than C, etc.) and you start to realize really quickly that you don't need data science to solve those problem, you just need a linear If statement: 

If customer does not have A, recommend A
ElseIF customer does not have B, recommendation B, etc.


There is a lot more that went into this decision that it hard to elaborate on over text, the final model is more complicated than what I described above but it is much simpler than what I would have come up with while I was at school.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SkI0M3RxREo1azFpUWNQY2k0eDJoTDBObkFhQjFvMXRkSEFZellwU0lTYzRWTERuWmlqZ3J2X1dhQ05BdlRVd090Z3hEaGRjVVVQdWJGeTVOVXFpdUE9PQ==

Don't worry, there is a set of models in the company I work for that uses an *average* Mean Absolute Error to determine its RAG status.

"After scouring over this reddit, it seems Data Science degrees are becoming this weird hybrid of watered down statistics and business, with the job market saturated by data science majors from cash grab programs. 

I am coming from a line of work in local government budgeting. Most of the work is simply in excel. While we're not busting out the ARIMA models here (maybe we should - government budget forecasts can be woefully inaccurate), the field is *trying* to move towards BI tools. 

Personally, I'd like to become more useful in statistical analysis and stay ahead of the field or leverage certain desirable skillsets in more specialized roles - even if it means moving towards federal work. 

I had considered [this](https://datascience.fsu.edu/students/course-descriptions) graduate degree program, specifically the statistics track. There seems to be a fair amount of R, SAS, & SQL, and plenty of statistics courses to choose from. 

My question is, does this degree pass the ""sniff test"" so to speak and do you think it's worth pursuing rather than simply learning on my own? The cost isn't an issue (tuition reimbursement). Time isn't an issue - planning on part-time student status.

If you’re looking to impress technical people you have two dimensions:
- Research. Demonstrate your ability to generate novel ideas.
- Execution. Demonstarte your ability to execute ideas.

If you can do both as a 4th year student I would be impressed :) 

Bad Example: Here is a titanic dataset and half baked notebook I forked and modified.

Good example: I like the works of Hemingway so I vectorised them and now you can do semantic search and talk with his texts, measure similarities between different works etc. Oh and btw it’s wrapped with docker and ready to be deployed and scaled.

"This is where hypothesis testing comes in. You test to see if the marketing strategy is statistically significant through either a 2-tailed t-test or f-test. Chances are you’re going to run an f-test. So you ask the question, can you reasonably reject the null hypothesis that your marketing strategy components are close to or equal to zero. If the t or f test comes back that the statistical significance of the marketing strategy is high, then you can reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that the marketing strategy has a level of significance or level of causation against the dependent variable (which would be sales). 

Most stats packages will have a way to automatically test it but it’s always good to test if each marketing strategy component is statistically significant vs the dependent variable. The variance covariance matrix is good to see if you’re going to have any high correlation between independent variables. The more correlations between them, you may need to change how you run your linear regressions because chances are, your marketing strategies will influence each other, driving up their significance. Thats why we test them together and individually to tease out variables that should have no impact on the dependent variable. 

There are other methods you can use such as chi-squared mean testing (same idea as t and f tests), observing the p-values on the stats readout, and then finally observing your r^2. Each of these together can give you a good idea of causation potential. But again be careful with correlation making it seem like there’s causation because variables will actually do that and mess with the process. We have tests that are separated from the usual tests such as Durbin-Watson (tests to see if your data is correlated with itself over time), whites test (tests to see if your data is evenly distributed, and if not you can add weights or get more data),ANOVA for 1 outcome on variances and MANOVA for multiple outcomes on variances. I’m sure I’m missing a whole bunch of other tests to check for heteroskedasticity (biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median), autocorrelation (data correlates with itself over time), and other issues that arise from running panel data. 

The biggest issue you’ll run into with marketing strategies and testing for causation, is that marketing strategies often carry multiple components to it, so teasing out one component vs another becomes tedious as you have to test each vehicle separately as an independent variable. And some of those variables have lagged effects such as TV and print. So we often have to put in retention rates on the campaign pieces and each one will have differing retention rates. Then you also have to sometimes lag one item vs another because there’s a lag effect from the moment the consumer watches the ad to when they go out and purchase the product. 

My point is, for marketing strategies, it’s often a complex enough thing that a whole industry was created to essentially study, disseminate, and understand what marketing vehicles work best and how that consumer preference for media consumption has changed significantly over time.

Edit to add: you’re always going to have noise outside of a variable. In the real world, there’s going to be random stuff that will affect the dependent variable and to say there is no outside noise is disingenuous. Thats why when you often run regression models you have residuals. It’s basically the left overs after teasing out the variables you are testing vs the dependent variable. The closer to 1 of an r^2, the less noise you experience or residuals in your model, but that should be a huge cause for concern if your model fit is really close to 1. It means that your model isn’t accounting for things outside of your control such as competition, consumer spending issues, government mandates, etc. Unless your company is a natural monopoly, there’s absolutely no way you won’t have some level of residual noise in your data. That should indicate that you’ve got a problem with your data or your model itself.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6RFpHWmN4N2p5WUhHZTZERmVEbDA2SmRKZ0FkRl9GY0xKNHVRMVFqWHN6REJad2hwUFpDOXlwbmExQXhqSkU5eWIwWTQtazhGX0RMUl9QX0h4VjdUU2c9PQ==

"A large company I worked for had an almost even split between FTEs and overseas contract labor (as well as in-Florida contract labor, and then all of our office staff was comprised of contract laborers as well). It led to extreme siloing of projects, difficult-to-trace dependencies in the data, and mountains of tech debt. Contract labor, especially contract labor overseas, was obviously much lower paid. Practically, Data Engineering was contract labor, and Data Science was FTE, for the most part.

What really made me feel icky was how racially segregated positions were: FTEs were typically white, with the occasional person from China or Japan. Contract labor, typically Indian, even in the Florida location. Office staff -- Black. FTEs got a certain amount of job security. Not so with the contractors.

Spurious correlations in compositional data is an epidemic in bioinformatics. There was a workflow developed called WGCNA which really pioneered association networks in genomics but the premise was wrong because you can’t use correlation to analyze compositional data. Since then there have been developments from geology that can be used as a drop in replacement (Rho proportionality and partial correlation with basis shrinkage) that can be used instead of correlation then the rest of the workflow can be used. There are also some other flaws in the workflow like signed and unsigned transformations of correlations but the idea of clustering in the network is cool.

"From a quick glance at the course material, I would say the program looks pretty solid. Good options to specialize in one direction of Data Science (which I have seen on this subreddit as being one of the more problematic parts of Data Science degrees: lack of depth in any area). I believe good Data Science teams should have a mix of Statisticians, Mathematicians, Computer Science experts/Software Engineers, and Business Domain experts (it is just impossible for one person to be everything). So to see a program reflect that is a plus in my book.

If you can, try to mix some coursework from other tracks as well. Specialization with some exposure to other areas will give you a lot of perspective on the Data Science field.

I would also try to reach out to some of the alumni on LinkedIn and Reddit to see what they think.

Although if you're more personally interested in Statistics in general, maybe try for an Applied Statistics degree with a Data Science track as well.

Working analytics at a multi billion dollar public company and fighting for a few millisecond throughput advantage / .1% edge in a highly competitive quantitative market is going to be much more advanced theoretical work than analyzing something like ticket sales for a sports team.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NFc1VUR6dGNsME44cTh0c2E3Z2xHVXZ6Q1hrWkJVNDRQMVRhaVBXV2pmY2h0TWFoU3hCbm1ZVVp2WGdySXFfU3dnSDBxTS1JbmszQ1JYd0x2OHNaMmc9PQ==

.think of it as a fraud detection problem in the credit card domain

Every year you are likely to get frauds because of stolen identity.

Every 2-4 years you might get a smaller fraction of frauds due PoS terminals getting hacked

Every 7-10 years you might get an instance of a fraud due a organized scam network.

Now if you want to model frauds and take a time slice of 5 years, it's very likely you will miss out on the last kind. Very likely that you will not have enough examples of the second kind too. Too have a comprehensive coverage of all reasons for frauds and a reasonable amount of examples you need to stretch your panel period

PS. Want to clarify here that frauds in this case would not follow a set cyclic pattern like you might be led to believe in my example, that was just illustrative, in reality they are far more randomly distributed over time, which makes the problem harder since if you pick any one particular year, there's a possibility that it has higher occurrences of a certain type of fraud for some reason or vice versa.

- 3 screens with team members around working with eng/design/PMs, experimentation, and then a ""how would you approach this problem and what metrics would you define"" interview. Was very casual  
- HM jerked me around for a few days and said he was going on PAT leave and won't actually hire for another 4-6 months. No offer.

Company B (even smaller startup, very small team), Analytics Engineer role:  
- HM screen  
- SQL screen  
- Business case conversation / tell me about a project that you had significant influence on interview  
- Python screen  
- Python Leetcode screen  
- No offer

What I find very frustrating is in the SQL and business case screens, I asked both team members what needs they had on the team, and their answers were essentially exactly what I do now and things that I could contribute day 1.

"For product analytics DS roles, it’s typically been: 

1. Recruiter 

2. Technical - SQL always and sometimes also Python

3. Hiring Manager to do a deep dive on your experience and past projects 

4. Panel with anywhere from 3-6 sessions - usually at least 1 product manager for case study questions, a DS for technical or stats questions, someone non-technical for behavioral/values alignment and/or collaboration or cross functional questions, if it’s a people manager role then also management questions 

Sometimes steps 2 and 3 are switched.

Sometimes (less often) there is a takehome instead of or in addition to the technical. Sometimes that also means a presentation and maybe a code review. 

Sometimes there is a final round after the panel with a more senior person. The skip level manager or VP of DS or CEO or something depending on the size of the company.

"TFW we feel it’s necessary to model sales for an addictive substance. 

My interactions with people in the domain have revealed there are bigger problems (lower hanging fruit) than automating pastry ordering(?):

* improve POS device interface to be efficient, non sequential, and stable - I’ve heard these devices at shops with complex menus are an absolute fucking nightmare. Nothing is ordered in a rational way, multiple pages of selections (with no apparent order), and entering in drink/food customizations is sequential and an immutable order. Think, if you change your mind about the milk choice, the cashier has to back out the whole cart and re enter everything. 

* improve order in general. Employees throw stock anywhere and everywhere when closing leaving opening shift to go on treasure hunts. Meanwhile, algorithms have decided it’s best to schedule people for clo-opening shifts because it’s most efficient (because they remember what random closet they put the cups in the night before). 

I dunno, automating pastry ordering? Half the reason people buy pastries is FOMO impulse when they see that last cheddar croissant sitting in the case.

"I think the question is ""how can I calculate a treatment effect of a variable after controlling for other variables?"" A method that's popular is Double ML based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00060). It allows you to  calculate treatment effects of a variable (your event) after accounting for explanatory variables (other events that might have changed between versions). It's also fairly simple to implement in Python. I'm still getting to grips with how to use this method appropriately though, and I've seen both intuitive and funky results. So if you do end up using it let me know how it goes!

I built a tool that streamlines my data science work with Python notebooks using AI. I shared this app a few months ago ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1agknrn/i_built_an_app_to_do_my_data_science_work_faster/)) and got some great feedback from you all. After some iterations, my buddy and I just released an open-source version catered to data scientists like ourselves!

We created this tool to solve common problems we'd faced in our data science work at previous companies. We released it on GitHub yesterday, and I'd love for you all to take it for a spin:

"Something light.  I once had a job interview that asked me to do sentiment analysis and report back.  I was told to spend around 2 hours on it and I could take my time sleeping on the problem before getting started.  Take home assignments like this are my favorite because I get to comfortably show real work.

I put the sentiment analysis job interview project on Github.  After that every company I interviewed with including every recruiter asked me about it thinking it was the coolest thing, as if it was some major project I had done.  I was honest and told them it was a job interview project, so it was basic sentiment analysis from a library, not anything too complex.  This didn't matter, because by this point they were already interested in me.  That single job interview project helped me get my foot in the door for many interviews after that.

Ironically I've done some really cool personal projects and none of them caught anyone's attention.  It's the small scale stuff everyone takes notice in.  In 2010 when I got my first DS job the company interviewed me because I was listed as a maintainer of PfSense, a popular router software.  All that I had done was fixed a single line of code because the maintainer of that part of the codebase had been MIA for 3 years and the bug had a large influence on my network.  This gave tremendous credit, but it was just a one line change that took 5 minutes to do.

Speaking of bug fixes this one video game company gave me access to their source code to show off.  I'm not a gamer and I run Linux at home, so I modified (""fixed"") their makefile so that it could build and run on Linux.  Upon them finding out they bypassed all of the interviews they planned for me and sat me down with the lead dev of the company asking for me to personally work under him.  I'm a DS that does analysis and pattern matching.  I don't want to do SWE work, so ofc I turned them down.  I guess they just hyper honed in on that one part.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R1BiV1dHSllEU2l1cTktQ2lPdDZRTnp1cFNlZzMwUUtXMzVGYy1QQmFLR0ZnT0NHM2xDbWJxaEFQVEdfYXJPRzZlMTgzU2dJNTBGMmhhaW1PRUw5bWc9PQ==

"u/Powerful_Tiger1254 gives good suggestions. Just wanted to clarify this is indeed causal inference based on observational data (because, for whatever reason, you cannot use the gold standard of A/B test). 

Causal inference, and even more so, when done on observational data, requires much more than the model or the data. So, before jumping onto the modelling part, I'd suggest the OP some hints:  
  
1. Establish both plausibility and the path by which the specific event ""causes"" the engagement: is it directly or through some other mechanism? (Read up on Bradford Hill's causality criteria - a bit dated and somewhat coarse, but useful nonetheless)

2. You must learn the difference between colliders, mediation and confounders. Otherwise, you're at risk of doing silly models.

3. Use DAGs to help sketch 1 and 2 (I mean real DAGs not a bunch of arrows LOL)

4. You don't have to use pure ML model for this. There's a huge body of literature from epidemiology, biostatistics and econometrics (indeed, one of the last Nobel prize in economics was awarded for this type of problems). Propensity score matching (I'm not a fan, just illustrative of the vast body of work) was developed in the early 1980's.

  
I suppose that if this is a game, you should have an easier time to isolate a possible causal link (because presumably in a game hard rules are known ahead of time).",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1ckVZZy1TZDhEbENCOS1VQTdqdEdpNmg3U21ZdGVZZjUzUHhDX2VfQ09YcHdETWc4ajNkUFdPa19sY3JySGpfMjlwajRvQ0Q0U0FEOVJaMWlndVdZU3c9PQ==

"People are usually let go soon after hiring due to ""bad organisational fit"".

The interview process, even after many rounds, can not fully uncover all facets of an applicant's personality, and most usually it's how they fit in the team, and colleagues across the organisation.

"Clearly the interview process does not produce results with roc auc of 1. 

Therefore, the interview process is not fully capable of identifying the optimal candidate. And that assumes each instance of collecting applicants has full access to the entire pool of employees, employed or otherwise. It does not.

A business seeks to maximize profit. There is likely a diminishing return to further expanding the candidate review process in terms of resultant employee profitability. 

In human terms, a company can only hire from the people it can access. It cannot hire people it cannot access. Timing, weather, location all play a part. A perfect candidate may have eaten a bad hot dog for lunch and bombed the air interview. A perfect candidate may be interviewed by a panel who ate a bad hot dog for lunch and was subsequently viewed in less than perfect light. 

Considering the diminishing returns, it’s probably easier and cheaper to hire and fire than to spend months or years fretting over the unknowns of a specific candidates projected quality. Especially when doing tech developments that require first to market results to be competitive. 

Then consider all the other factors that may influence a company to hire and fire. Top of mind is when a company pays the majority of comp in equity that is forfeited in some part when an employee is terminated. Suddenly one can attract the best talent by hanging a shiny golden carrot in front of them, then yank it away right as they cross the finish line with a pip and termination. 

Then, let’s also consider firms with hire fire notoriety also tend to align with stack rank culture. If a manager has a solid team but is required to stack rank and drop bottom 10%, they may just make some sacrificial hires throughout the year who will be pip’d and fired. Then the manager gets to keep the core team intact.  ",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1NGozMzB6VUN5S2hWV2R3Snh4NkhxNnpIczZraEwwNDlQRTBFMTM0Y2VQMmtXQXZQVTZJcmtLNnVhYTJUU3l3NzhEcmgyWmpkcDhiQnZ1WXo2VDNVeWc9PQ==

Interview processes are imperfect. Even longer ones typically don't add up to more than a days worth of evaluation. To some extent, you still need to see how someone works for a period of e.g. 6 months to know whether you made a good decision.

"An aspect of personal projects that I think is underrated is that you’ll be able to talk about them during your interviews. Multiple interviewers asked me to talk about a project I worked on, and I was able to use my personal projects to answer those questions. Sure, it’s unlikely that the recruiter or the HM will actually look at them, but it gives you something to talk about. 

I think you should come up with a project that is personal to you, that way a little bit of your personality comes through in the response as well.

"This is usually a bad fit for the company, and that can mean a lot of things. 

The biggest problem is usually a desperate person being hired by a desperate hiring manager. I have seen a manager who burned through 4 people in one position in a year. One guy lasted 3 weeks. 

She was the worst micromanager and would talk down to everyone who worked for her and she was a horrible boss. She would shit-talk the people who worked for her to other managers in front of the people she was talking about. 

I was approached by the guy who had been there for three weeks about two weeks in and asked if he could move to my team. I had to let the other manager and my boss know what was going on so that I wouldn't get into the situation, but I honestly felt bad for the guy. She evidently ripped into him and was very disrespectful and she basically said she was going to PIP him out and at that point dude just left. The guy she hired about 3 months later left after less than 3 months after she PIPed him. 

On the other hand, I've also fired some people who have clearly lied on their resume. We do pre and post-hire background checks and I have had to let people go who lied about their last job. He said he worked as a manager at a competing company and was a VP there. The background check after he was hired came back with him not working there and also not a VP. He was a programmer and had been fired from the company almost 2 years earlier. 

I also have had people who just don't want to do what they have to do for the job.

Im going into my junior year of college, studying Statistics with a minor in Data Science. What can I do to land an internship next summer?

"My current role was created for me specifically. I'd been working in internal audit, or other risk/control roles, at financial institutions for around 10 years. I'd been with my current employer for a few years in the audit department on the audit practices team and was there while I worked on my masters. About the time I finished my masters I actually put a model into production that caught the CAE's attention and he decided he wanted me working directly for him at that point.

My current role varies a lot from day to day but I would say is very heavy on data science knowledge, but at best 50% of my time is doing hands on data science work. I basically have four primary focuses:

Advise the CAE and Audit Executives on subject matter and best practices. Lately this has been lots of conversations about what AI can and can't do. Low hanging fruit for quick integration and adaption of AI into current processes. I also do a lot of advising on how audit should be covering model risk, from the strategic level on where it fits in our risk assessment, to the tactical level of test procedures when models are involved in processes. This is around 30% of my time.

Root cause analysis and predictive analytics around strategic decisions. This tends to be ad hoc analysis around policy or procedure changes to help support large decisions. For example, we recently made some policy updates and the CAE had me do some analysis on how the changes would impact hours budgets for audits and issue validations. I spun up a few regression models and estimated the effects on hours budgets in the different scenarios. This is probably 40% of my time.

I occasionally get to build actual models that go into production. Recently I built a model that clustered audit issues and then had a dashboard for each cluster to show why the issues were clustered and visualize how the issues in the cluster affect the enterprise and the severity of the issues. It's reviewed by a user to identify thematic issues. Previously someone used to read every single issue and try and manually identify themes. I don't get to do this often, maybe 10% of my time.

The remaining 20% of my time is just data analyst type work. CAE or some executive wants a report and I go pull the data and build some pretty charts. I try and push back on this work by educating my leaders that this is an underutilization of my abilities and by teaching others how to do this work so they can instead be assigned this work. That said, sometimes it just needs to get done so it falls on me to do it.

There's definitely a lot of positions out there that are just business/data analyst type roles with a data science title. Unfortunately there's no consistency across companies or even within them on this. It really comes down to the knowledge of the hiring manager on what data science actually is. In order to avoid those roles you really have to be careful to question the hiring manager on what the deliverables are for the role during the interview process.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1YlFjaHVsQkNyZzd6VjJ6eTh5em4tazFaWm96NFpsWEEzeDlxUjdPa2kzQnFqQnFOWFFTdklUeDFPenJqSml5T1pjdWJVLVU0U0VfMnV1bm1uTEhVd2c9PQ==

like i get it, i didnt like being taken advantage of, being paid 1/3 of what full timers got paid, while doing the same level of work as them. but on the other hand, at least i had a nice resume and can get a better next job. my current resume looks like im more like an intern program manager than data",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1U0FVdXN1ZE5nZTdQY2xYam1mRG9xVm1fcmRRYTR5V0xKa1J2aV9IeHpJcFVxNlVhR1YydzRxX3BmU0V2VUJZLVV5TVU0Z3ZlbUJ1RzNIZFdRc250SHc9PQ==

"Try to retrain the model on the same data with the same hyperparameters and the same machines. I believe you'll encounter the same scenario. The local minima that is obtained when you train your model would be different for every new model you create. That could be why your output is similar but not an exact replica.

I think you're right that I'm arriving at slightly different local minima each run, and i think it's probably with HDBSCAN and that's the cause of the issue. The umap scatter plot looks the same across runs aside from being rotated bc the x and y axes are flipped sometimes. 

I've basically taken the approach you described by just tuning and saving the model I like to load into python later, but something about the approach feels wrong to me... Like, the local minima are different enough that the research conclusions would vary a bit between runs. For example, I cannot even confidently say what the three most frequent topics are because they switch a little bit each run.

"I have a different view from you about why the conclusion isn't consistent. It could be possible that the data inherently has 3-4 topics that are nearly equally prevalent. So while their ranking might shift due from second to third for example, the margin by which they do is so small that a slight change in model will cause it to assign topic 3 a value of 19.9 and 4 20.0 while an earlier model gave topic 3 a value of 19.8 and topic 4 19.9 resulting in a change in ranking.

"""The company is paying more than for an equivalent FTE"" - not necessarily once you consider costs of benefits, hiring, training, etc. General rule is that a FTE costs +50% to +150% of their cash compensation. With a contractor at least the expense is all wrapped up into their pay.

""the contractor is less motivated to do quality work because it's going to be someone else's problem soon"" - questionable assertion, and if you think that the *someone else's problem* syndrome isn't present in FTEs - then you've been very fortunate!

I lead a small consulting group. We get hired because we have specialty skills and can work quickly on a specific problem. And when we're done, we're gone. No PIPing, no coaching, just *thank you for your service*.

You can put that Astrophysics research experience under your work experience. Maybe give yourself a relevant job title like ""Research Data Analyst"" or ""Research Analyst"" or something.

"Currently going through with my undergrad degree, and am going to graduate in 2026 with a BA in Geography with a concentration in Data Science (GIS equivalent at my school), a minor in Statistics and a minor in Data Science. While technically a BA, my major is fairly technical, as it includes a lot of work with data and a good amount of coding (R, Python, Java, etc). 

It would make more sense to graduate with a more technical degree, but unfortunately due to my school's system of allotting majors, it wouldn't be possible for me to switch to a Stats or CS major at this point, so Geography DS is the closest I can probably get. My question is, with this degree, how can I begin to align myself to be a competitive applicant for a MDS?

The stats minor is a late add, as I now realize that I need a much stronger foundation in math. The coursework for the stats minor covers calculus, probability, ""statistical computing"". I see a lot of programs also are looking for Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calc, which the stats minor does not cover. Are these two topics required for all programs?

"Hi everyone, 

for over a year now I've been building [DataAnalyst.com](http://DataAnalyst.com) - a platform specifically focused on data analyst career path - from daily jobs (all including salary ranges), interviews with data analyst professionals, monthly report about salary trends as well as the data analyst salary guide (by industry, experience, location).

In that time, I've added over 2,300 data analyst jobs in the US, and 14 different interviews, that I believe bring different point of views, stories of growth and sharing unique paths that each individual took to navigate their careers.

There's an absolute ton to learn from these:

- how to land data role internally within an organisation

- the power of showcasing and reframing your experience outside the direct data analytics field, and

- how moving into more leadership roles requires more than just being a data wiz

I've been building in public, sharing monthly updates, and just wanted to share the latest one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1dea6rw/dataanalystcom\\_i\\_launched\\_a\\_niche\\_job\\_board\\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1dea6rw/dataanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board_with/)

Hopefully if that's something that reasonates with the community here, going forward I could share directly on the subreddit, rather than in the weekly thread. 

Always happy to chat about feedback on the platform, as well as feature experienced professionals who are looking to share their journey. 

Thanks!

We've hired juniors in the past, including one guy who had just finished his Bachelors, but that was 2-3 years ago when we were hiring a lot more people.

I know getting to the interview is often the hard part  though. 

Networking is always useful but unless you're applying at a small startup or you're at the staff+ level that just lets you skip HR filters, you're still going through the recruitment pipeline. Networking might also let you know of positions before they hit the ""open market"". 

When selecting which candidates to interview I usually took their resumes into consideration as well as how they did in our technical assessment.

In the resume I'm mostly looking for problems that require creative thinking and some production sense. I'm looking for people that know stats and ML but I'm not looking for PhDs who can't even do a pull request.

"`fit` is a training step, which may or may not be deterministic depending on the model. BERTopic is, at its heart, a clustering algorithm and training clustering algorithms are generally non-deterministic. K-Means clustering isn’t deterministic in this way either. There may be deterministic clustering algorithms. I don’t know, but generally I don’t expect them to be. Clustering algorithms often provide a `fit_transform` convenience method, but it is fitting the model and performing inference at the same time. With many, but not all, clustering methods, you can `fit`, save the model, and use `transform` on new data points to classify your new data point into the closest cluster from your training run. Then your clusters won’t change for new datapoints. 

UMAP also is also a source of randomness in BERTopic, [as they describe in their Best Practices document](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/best_practices/best_practices.html#pre-calculate-embeddings). 

```
from umap import UMAP

umap_model = UMAP(n_neighbors=15, n_components=5, min_dist=0.0, metric='cosine', random_state=42)
```

I suspect this is the source of your complaint. You’re getting different clusters each time you run `fit`. You need to seed its random state with a static value to get deterministic behavior. I typically use a bash command to get a random seed that I stick into a variable at the top of my notebook.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1MG1uZkpMbTQ1QXRfYXlkYm9UR1RYZDRwaUFwS0FtaXB1VTlPY0xJdm9pTERhLVRqZ2hOTVl1T3ByVUlsNDlRZVBCTk5rLWlTSWJNdkRqZ0R6T3EtWnI1VnRwT0U2bDh0Qnh1ZkpPS0R3bVk9

" I do appreciate that you wrote this out but as I mentioned:

1. I already set a random seed for UMAP and get different results each time (albeit not majorly different)
2. I am already aware that HDBSCAN is stochastic, it's just that the documentation I read suggested there would be little variability, and I observed what I considered to be a lot of variability. I think I will switch to a different clustering algorithm that supoorts setting a random seed/state for reproducibility. Models can be stochastic and still reproducible with a seed, like you mentioned, if that's supported functionality. It's not supported for HDBSCAN. But I know for a fact you can set a random seed for reproducibility with Gaussian Mixture Models (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html). 
3. As I mentioned, I have no need for inference. This is not relevant to my project and not a use case I need, though I understand it's common with BERTopic. I have one, self-contained dataset I am using BERTopic to describe.

"As a Data Scientist who was educated with Master program in the U.S and now taking management role in terms of Data Science in Vietnam, I have to say the hiring process, especially for higher level such as senior staffs or even managers,  was evaluated by business persons who just read some over-marketing magazines and over-evaluate the data scientist, like, data scientists can do every thing. It is similar to the thought that AI can do every things now just by an inquiry, just like ChatGPT. In some aspect, we cannot deny the capabilities of ChatGPT or GenAI, however, they seem far to fulfil the imaginary thoughts of the business persons.

"I'm a hiring manager not a recruiter. 

Recruiters don't know or understand shit if we are honest. They are chunking everything including the kitchen sink at an opening to get their metrics filled. 

Honestly, right now you are pretty screwed if you are hoping to get a job with only your undergrad projects. 

Your projects should get you internships and your internship gets you a job, OR you get a job in industry and your experience in the industry gets you a job. 

Maybe you go undergrad to grad school and never have an internship and your grad school projects get you a job, but if we are all being really honest, most schoolwork doesn't do enough to make you a great candidate. Especially when GOOD jobs and even semi-decent jobs are getting overwhelmed with responses by people who have industry experience or much more data experience. 

Not to be mean, but why would I pick someone who took who knows how long, to build a model, that takes who knows how much from someone else,to show me something about a field I have absolutely no idea how insightful the information is, and how accurate it works, when I have 5 guys who have a minimum of 5 years in the industry and/or 5 years of data experience? Those people might be coming from another school and just finished working in a data program, but their prior industry experience is going to trump you. 

Here is my biggest challenge hiring a no-experience candidate, I don't even know if you know how to adult yet. 

Its too hard for me to try and teach you what my industry has to show you, AND teach you how real-world data works, AND make sure that you are not going to screw up as a person fresh into the professional world.

10 years ago I might take a CS major and give him a shot. But now, there are a significant number of people who are boomeranging back to school for data and they come with industry experience. 

That person has half the amount of training needed as you. 

The person who was in XYZ industry doing data and now wants to work in data in mine only has to learn the industry. 

The next person I am looking for is going to come with an internship under their belt, and they can at least show me they have done some production work. They hopefully can run some SQL queries, maybe knows a new toy I don't know but want. 

If you still have time I recommend getting an internship and leveraging that into a job. Its your fastest way into a perm role. 

If that doesn't work out, you should be looking for a substantial experience role in the industry you want to work in. I highly recommend (if you don't have a financial background) looking at jr nonfinancial auditor jobs in the industry you want to work for. Its not super easy to get those jobs right now as well, but it's easier. Those are boot camp jobs that will teach every aspect of the industry. 

There is a downside to this expect to see some traveling. 

If you have a financial or accounting background, the financial internal audit positions are great as well and are high-visibility roles near the people who you need to network with. 

I am in the finance food chain and I'd pick an auditor in my company to move to a data role before I would pick an outsider with only college projects. 

TLDR: go get a job in audit and work your way over, or get an internship and try to find a solution that way.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2S2ttdURtZFFtaDg1RHRDbW1ncm1rMDdFMnNzdHdZdDhMMTRvRDlJWkdmaU50XzlWOEJMcHRPOTlCZXRycWtiQzZpUTZJaXJjWEF5amZWN0xhUnNiTUE9PQ==

If schools doesn't work I look for someone that served in the same Army unit as me or a similar one.

I’m currently working on my master thesis and I’m looking for some inputs for the following situation:

I have data of 2-20 sensors all measuring the same variable at 1-3 different locations in 15mins-interval (=96 obs/day), so I expect all measurements to be almost the same (if same location) or relatively similar (if different location).  In my thesis, I introduced an approach/algorithm which performs anomaly detection using pairwise regression of sensor data (of same location) and (in my opinion ) smart tracking of the coefficients, and it seems to perform quite alright. Evaluation is done using artificial errors which have been added in collaboration with domain experts, since generally no ground truth is available. An error always affects only one sensor, but it’s possible that multiple errors are active at the same time independently. (While I definitely appreciate your comments about this, this should not be the main point of my post) 

For scientific reasons I need 1-2 other techniques to compare my approach to, which is why I’m asking for your advice here. Generally, it would be nice to have fundamentally different approaches (e.g. my algorithm with regression, something DL-based, something completely different) but this is not too important, I only need a way for a scientific and objective comparison. Since the method described above should be the main focus of the work, the additional methods should not be super much work. I have 1,5 fulltime-months left so I can (and will) definitely implement sophisticated approaches and do not need to take something “out of the box” (in case that exists), but implementing the other methods should not be another master thesis. 

 I was looking into Matrix Profile ([https://www.cs.ucr.edu/\\~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html)) since it seems to be a quite promising technique, however its main focus points seem to be univariate time series and my problem needs to be considered multivariate, since the behavior of the data can change quite a lot (which is fine if they all show the same). I tried applying MP to one single sensor data and it only found the most obvious errors and also many false positives. There are some papers about extending to multivariate case (e.g. [https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611977653.ch77](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611977653.ch77)), but it does not seem to be very fitting in my situation where errors usually only show on one sensor, not on k out of n. So I don’t really know how to best apply MP in this case.

 Beside that, I thought about Deep Learning based approaches and found DAEMON ([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9458835](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9458835)) and USAD ([https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394486.3403392](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394486.3403392)). However, they seem to be quite experimental and I don’t want to spend weeks to rebuild a NN from the written description not knowing if it is even suitable in my case.

So I would be really grateful for recommendations of methods (or other advices) for my situation, and feel free to ask if something about my problem description is unclear.

Thanks a lot!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2LTRHamdyME9tSm5CNXRSaVd5d2xJeFh2YzVObVBuOWh5QVFlR2NXdmhBVFlYTlc3emZaQmkxQ1pBRG1kZ0J1dkhJTWpTWUhQY2RIQ2tQdUhSV2wtdnc9PQ==

Additionally, you can use regression models with engagement as the dependent variable and the event as an independent variable, controlling for other factors.

To estimate the potential uplift from adding more events, you could use a predictive model like ARIMA or a machine learning model like a Random Forest that includes the event occurrence as a feature.

"Yes, you can keep NA values when building a machine learning model, and the information from other columns can still be useful. However, not all models can handle NA values directly. Algorithms like decision trees and their ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest) can manage NA values better, as they can treat them as a separate category.

For other models like, you might need to encode NA values differently, such as using a specific value like -1 or creating an additional binary indicator column to denote the presence of NA values.

"That’s the goal of Double ML (DML) or Double Robust Learner from econML, I would look up how those models work and get applied.

I’ll explain it briefly, DML fits two models: 

One to predict the outcome (say revenue from a user in the next X days) based on controls (user attributes, behavior, etc.). Calculate residuals Y_res

Second to predict the assignment of the treatment from those same controls. Residuals T_res.

You fit a new model Y_hat = theta * T_hat. This is typically called inverse propensity weighting when your treatment is binary. 

Theta from this regression is the Conditional Average Treatment Effect. Which accounts for the fact that your promotion was not randomly assigned.

"Sure. 

**Robyn** - not my favorite. I question the usefulness of their DecompRSSD metric - it feels a little too much like marketing grading their own homework. I also don't love it not being bayesian. It is pretty user friendly though and generates quite a few useful outputs. 

**LightweightMMM** - pretty decent. Supposedly going to be deprecated when Meridian is released to the public.

**pymc-marketing** - I've not used this, but the devs are making some great progress. Definitely one to keep an eye on. 

**Orbit** - build your own adventure. Probably the most flexible of the packages, but requires a bit of knowhow to make something that's actually good. 

**Other/BYO (Stan, PyMC)** - Takes quite a bit of knowledge and has a pretty steep learning curve. Definitely the most flexible and customizable option though.

Tips:

1. The most important part about MMM is the data. You need stakeholder buy in to generate good variance across channels. MMMs fail to generate good channel reads when the channel has constant/very low variance in spend over time (mostly ATL/OOH/TV type spend). You need to convince stakeholders to spend up/down in these type of channels over time, otherwise you won't get anything useful.

2. MMMs won't save you from needing to run experiments. Calibration from experimental data is hugely important in generating good consistent readouts. Generally these experimental results are fed into models as constraints/priors on specific channels.

3. Lots of marketing spend is collinear, which causes all kinds of problems with inferential models. Similar to point 1, it's important to convince stakeholders to adopt tactics that reduce collinear spend.

4. Be thoughtful about any macroeconomic factors you incorporate to the model. Most of them are produced on a substantial lagged basis, which makes it hard to be have timely results.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2OGZLbUpSWE1MckIxVGVLY3g3bXl3TmdpbmJRLVh4RGpMVFBheThvTnJfMEhzZXExcWxTY0djcDdSZ3pxbEhBQ0tRNW1rUTU1bC1XbEF5TTlPQ2tPcHhDLW4tc2dJWnRCUG9aQVJpSWdwcXM9

"This post from a couple of years ago still stands: [\\[D\\] What are the issues with using TMLE/G comp/Double Robust estimators to interpret ML models with marginal effects? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uk2ifk/d_what_are_the_issues_with_using_tmleg_compdouble/)

In general, although I don't have experience with marketing applications, I tend to frame these problems under the broad Frank Harrell and Andrew Gelman philosophies. Besides the specific modelling method, I pay a lot of attention to selection of covariates, optimism, calibration, sample size, specification of non-linearities, internal validity etc. These issues can be as important or more important than the choice of method alone.

For modelling method, I find the proportional odds ordinal regression extremely flexible. It's a semi-parametric model that makes fewer assumptions than many other parametric approaches and can handle numerous nuances with the data in an elegant way (such as count responses, clumping of the data around 0, flooring/ceiling effects, extremes in Y). You can estimate both mean and any percentile of interest (the latter better than quantile regression). You can also estimate exceedance probabilities (i.e. P(Y>y)) and this is extremely useful when translating results in practice. It's also robust to model misspecifications since misspecifications do not affect general assessments of effects - only individual predictions may be affected. Frank Harrell's rms library has a lot of functionality (see here for resources: [Ordinal Regression (hbiostat.org)](https://hbiostat.org/ordinal/)). Frank also has a Bayesian counterpart that would allow better inference on mean differences.

I also sometimes use multilevel models and, I'm not a fan of quasi-experimental approaches like ITS, although I have used them in the past and can be useful in some applications. Again, Frank Harrell has a nice use case where he uses splines and (I think) third derivatives to more flexibly estimate the effect at the jolt (i.e. the 3rd derivative).

"I couldn't figure out how to pass precalculated embeddings to BERTopic (didn't try too hard), so technically I'm doing the inefficient thing and vectorizing twice. But my data are only ~10k short comments, so it's pretty fast. As you mentioned, I also think the embeddings are deterministic and not the problem, though. I also set torch and numpy seeds in both blocks, too, so the embeddings should be the same even though I'm doing the dumb thing and vectorizing my text twice. 

I think the answer to my issues is either (a) not being able to set a seed for HDBSCAN, (b) differences between machines I'm running on (I'm using a diff. Machine a lot bc a cloud service), or (c) inherent complexity and the model just arriving at local minima. But even if C, then using a clustering algorithm with a random seed/state should solve the problem? 

I'm going to try it with a Gaussian Mixture Model later today and set the seed in the GMM. I think that should reduce the non-reproducibility... Unless its machine-level variance

"Lots of good answers, but something I would push everyone to clarify before going too far down the techincal discussion rabbit hole:

What do you mean by ""promotions"" and what types of sales?

Promotions mean a lot of different things in every industry. Like, at major CPG companies (Coca Cola, Pepsi/Frito Lay, General Mills, etc.), a promotion is normally a broad promotional event that is not targeted to individual consumers but rather to large swaths of consumers. So a promotion would be selling a 12-pack of coke for 5.99 instead of 6.99, or buy one get one half off, etc. This may be implemented by market, or by channel, or by partner (e.g., Krogers), but it's not going to be specific to the individual (i.e, Bob gets a 5.99 promo and Sandra gets a 5.49 promo price).

Promotions at other companies - like in B2B settings - may be literally specific to the customer, or in the case of some online services it might be targeted to literally specific people based on their attributes.

If you're in the first world, MMM is going to be more than enough to get the answers that you need. Because generally you don't need to worry about the decision maker-level influence of the promotion - it's more of a temporal thing (when was the promo active) and coverage (which segments were impacted). So it's fundamentally a macro strategy with macro effect.

If you're in the second world - i.e., where individuals, based on their attributed, were presented with specific promotions to try to induce them to buy - then everything you're seeing about causal inference becomes a lot more applicable. Because then you actually need to be very careful about how much of the impact that you saw can be attributed to the fact that you presented a promo to those people vs. those people (who were not randomly selected) being impacted by other exogenous factors.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2c0dRVkZvR3hTdjhYUjFBTXFlZE52clhrVk53VmNXb0F2aHQ1dWdISTMxSmowd2JGMzhXSFZpRnB4Q3h0SnVBRkZhQ0pYVi1JWUpwV25OanNlTWFiLVE9PQ==

"Couple of thoughts:

1. Recruiters don't care. Hiring managers might. 

2. If you want to impress a hiring manager, build an actual thing - like, ideally, build an app that does something that is actual somewhat useful. It doesn't have to be broadly useful (that's hard), but if you can build an app that does something useful for any group of people, that will draw some attention. 

The example I always give: I like fantasy football. If I was going to build something as a personal project, it would be a web app that scraped sports-reference or the espn fantasy data and gave you the ability to generate forecasts using a range of simple, adjustable methods to compare what those numbers look like depending on what you want to emphasize. There's probably all of like 20 people that would care to use this, but to those people it would be super cool.

My point being: don't start with an easy dataset and then show off your modeling skills en route to building something no one cares about. Instead, start with something you care about and then make it work.

3. Instead of spending your summer doing personal projects, I would recommend getting any type of job - even if not related to DS. Like, literally any type of job - Starbucks, retail store, temp job doing data entry, stocking stuff, waiter, whatever.

Why? Because weirdly enough something that is really valuable of a candidate is them showing that they can work in a standard work environment. That they can deal with customers, shitty coworkers, politics, pressure, learning things on the fly, etc. Experience as a waiter/waitress/retail worker/starbucks? Probably means you've learned how to talk to people better than the average data scientist. You've probably also learned how to work in an actual fast-paced environment. 

Another great option - tutoring. Why? It shows you know how to teach & communiate technical topics. 

The other advantage of a job over a personal project: you have to actually work. It's hard. You have to be there on time, you have to work on days when you don't feel like working, and you have to be good enough to not get fired.

Personal projects = you work whenever you want on whatever you want and no matter how bad you are, it doesn't matter. 

As a hiring manager, I would rather see a summer job of any kind over a personal project unless it's an extremely impressive personal project.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2NG54T3Nkd2dmNW1wdG5OQ2lFeFRLbnEtOHlINENoTlNRdUxYb2NVVmNxellSSFEwdnhPMlRucGhsUUJNM09LU1VmbHZaR1FWd0x4MnJOMEFHV2wyeHc9PQ==

"* Soft skills aren’t taught in school, but they make or break good data scientists. Stakeholder management is what will determine a good project from bad the majority of the time. A book could be written on how to manage a project and its stakeholders, but a few important notes are: (a) clarify expectations on timelines up front. If a new feature is requested, be clear on how that changes timelines. (b) determine what their problem actually is. A lot of times they think they need a particular solution (cough, LLMs), but that’s a solution-focused approach. You need to understand the problem, then pick an appropriate solution. Don’t be the person searching for nails, and don’t tolerate those who are (conditional on political constraints). (c) Determine what, if anything, they are currently doing to solve the problem. That is your benchmark. It’s not “can I beat just fitting the sample mean” or some other metric were taught in school, it’s “can I improve on what they already have?” If they have nothing, then my view is “anything worth doing is worth doing badly,” although there are times where no solution is better for sure. 

* A simpler, interpretable, quicker solution beats a slower, difficult to interpret, slow solution almost always. Simpler solutions are also easier to maintain. Boosting will be as good as a neural net on tabular data basically always. Linear models with a good understanding of interactions will be as good as boosting frequently. 

* Get it in writing. 

* Quadruple check for data leakage. You have it. You don’t think you do, but you do. 

* Ask for help, get others’ opinions when you’re stumped or uncertain, and don’t be afraid to say you don’t know something. Help your team, too. 

* Be careful when suggesting alternatives to a current solution in the org. Chances are, you’ll be implementing it/involved if you suggest it. 

* Keep an eye towards production always. Your solution is only a fraction of what has to be done, and it has to interface with other things. It’s best to think about those things ahead of time to save you some headache later. 

* Have a rollout plan. Fixing bugs in prod a day after launch is a pain. Having a rollout plan can smooth these things over a lot.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZXlNV21hLUFlczJueUhPZ2ozc01VdUFvZHotdlVnLXBCUDZlOGdLTURieXJkUW9MdnY1NVQ3V2ZlZ1ctcnVQN3djT0JoZFlLZzYwUUxLM2x4VlMwbXc9PQ==

"Hi all,

Subject: Keeping Data Science 'in my pocket' whilst doing a PhD

I'm very interested in Data Science but feel like my passion primarily lies in Academia. As such, I am going to apply and hopefully complete a PhD (Uk, 29M). I'm based in the UK, age 29, Male.

The PhD would involve coding a lot - definately Python and Matlab, maybe R too; I'm sure it would involve Machine Learning too and everything else - descriptives etc.

My question is thus:

How can I 'keep my toe in data science' as it were? Basically, if I finished the PhD and never wanted to see Academia again (like the other 99% of PhDs), how could I keep myself relevant throughout the PhD?

Obvious answers are Linkedin posting, creating a cool portfolio/ website etc.

Also - I'm wondering what people's predictions are for the Data Science market - increasing / decreasing, will AI take over and steal jobs, salaries decreasing, jobs shipped overseas.

Thank you and well done if you got to here!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TXBLZG5MWlBIOXgya2hERnpkVTkyZXZlYWxNam1JLVJwT19SMkJhZ3cxbzZxdTZ0NF94alFqZHdhNGZtdVFNS2V6RGltYmxTSWFYZzE1NHdwLUNLb2c9PQ==

"I'm in a different spot altogether, but be gentle with yourself, let's say common folk have been put through the wringer, and there is yet more to come. Great and terrible changes are on the horizon .  Depends on how we handle it all.  It is staggering .

Fitting in can mean different things.  I think you can channel your ambition into the managerial push for incorporating AI.  Though you may not yet have compelling use cases (do you?) , one long-term  use case is preparatory for future use cases: that is, getting your team acquainted with AI and necessary foundational knowledge of neural networks and stochastic optimization , data driven vs model driven methods.

Although it may be off putting, whatever your business' purpose is, it's clear that there is at least enough hype to create pressure from investors and clients to at least be able to tangibly say that your AI initiative is being actively assessed by a team of experts.

"When did Tableau become THE thing that hiring managers require?

My first experience with data science was in graduate school doing bioinformatics with R and Python. During the pandemic I was working in a more IT-related job, and after I was building a website using Python/Flask, Postgresql, and R/Shiny on the theory that I should learn to be more of a ""full-stack"" developer so that I could build apps to work with data in real time.

Unfortunately, now I am actually looking for my first job in the data science/data analysis field, and it seems that half or more of the jobs on Linkedin are for Tabeleu developers. All the Python-related positions seem to be extremely senior.

Are Python and R being phased out in favor or Tableu (or other BI dashboards) for everyone except actual computer scientists/engineers? When did this happen and how did I miss it? I never even heard about Tableau until my recent job search started.

I feel like perhaps I made a mistake by ignoring all those Facebook ads warning me that ""coding is dead"".

"I'm having difficulty understanding where my experience and knowledge fits into this saturated job market.

I recently graduated from a Masters in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with almost 10 years prior experience in FP&A and corporate finance. I moved from Analyst -> Sr. Analyst -> Manager before I decided to pivot careers. I loved the ad-hoc analysis in FP&A, primarily because it involved diverse problems to tackle and learn from.  It often involved significant modeling in Excel and development of business acumen, and on the very rare occasion where it involved statistics or SQL coding, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

However, I strongly disliked the crux of FP&A work, which revolved around the monthly/quarterly close monotony and small, generic financial data sets. I wanted my work to revolve much more around uncovering patterns in large/diverse data sets and simplifying complex insights for the rest of the business to work off of.  

I've been looking into everything from entry level Data Scientist, to Sr. Data Analyst, to Economic Consultant, to Management Consultant, to Strategic Finance positions. My Masters gave me a solid overview of near everything.

Hello! This is my first ever post but I don’t have as much time as I’d like to dedicate to this issue. I have never programmed before in my life and have recently gotten into a REU (research experience for undergraduates) program. In this program I was tasked with finding the peaks in valleys of this data set from an experiment. I would have loved to have been able to just go through it manually but there is just too much data 100000> entries to sort through. I had told my mentor that I had never done any coding work but she said this was a great chance to learn. So I started doing this Harvard CS50 python course and also have a data analysis using python course I’m going to go through. Unfortunately she wants results and I cannot deliver in the time frame she is looking for. I was wondering if anyone had any advice for what I should do as far as coming up with a way to automate the process of analyzing this data. She wants me to have a program I can give to her she can just plug and play. Any advice is appreciated even something  as simple as telling me to figure it out it’s not that hard lol. I tried reaching out to a professor I had last semester who does data analysis for a living but she’s on Vacation in Italy for the summer and has not been able to respond to me. Thanks!,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ZWEwRlhpNDU1VTNXcHROQV84UTZEY19HQ2FGM2xoYjhyVkhpSGZEQkdNV0t4NXItUklwV0lvWUNILWR4MkRlUnVIQVcwTkpxeHBGcHFMOWNpX0g4VGc9PQ==

"Should I quit my job?

I am a Compliance Data Scientist, two years out of an MS in data science from a non-impressive state school. The phrase 'data scientist' should be taken with a fistful of salt, because the most coding/math I ever do is write simple SQL queries. I mostly just make reports and conduct super boring testing. I don't like it and I'm not even that good at it.

I desperately need something more challenging. Something at a place where I can \\*learn\\* new things. I've found the job search to be very difficult, especially because my current job hasn't given me any good experience towards the more stat/math heavy job I am looking for.

I live in Seattle and work remotely for a place in the midwest. I want to find a job that is hybrid or in person, and I don't want to leave Seattle.

I make 100k with no stocks/bonuses. I have about 15k in liquid savings, and my girlfriend has a very solid job and could, in the worst case scenario, support me with expenses for quite a while.

Would I be insane to quit my job and lock myself in a library for a few months until I find something different? I would work on a few personal projects to throw into a portfolio. Brush up on machine learning concepts I haven't thought about since I was in grad school. How shitty is the job market right now?

"I moved from ""passion"" to ""passion"" rather quickly growing up. When I got to college and had to pick a major (and while I am the type to be indecisive beforehand, I'm also the type to stick it out with whatever decisions I make) was the first time I spent 4 straight years primarily focusing on one thing. I was in love with physics that whole time. After a year at my first job doing nothing physics related at all, I think I finally figured out that the longer I spend doing something, the more passionate I am about it. The more details I can learn and dig in, the more vast I realize the minutiae of the topic are, the more I learn how impressive it can be for someone to *really* excel and have expertise in a field, the more I fall in love with it. I started a new job a year ago that's about 10-20% embedded hardware & electronics design, 30-40% programming, and 40-50% test engineer (hence being here), and I gotta tell you, there's been a massive shift in the flavor of my personal projects recently.

"Thanks for your inquiry. It is hard to pin down what people do in complex systems because people interested in such systems work in a variety of natural and social sciences. In general, they are interested in studying the emergence of phenomena in a system that is unexpected based on the behaviors of individual agents (flocking birds and the segregation of neighborhoods are two common examples). It is kind of a ""whole is greater than the sum of its parts"" thing.

In my own work, I focus on classifying and predicting chaotic time series data. I have also developed agent-based models of simple economies to understand how various tax structures affect the distribution of wealth.

If it's either of the above, I agree with you. I believe the issue is that ""data science"" has changed definition from meaning a field of study & research, to meaning a title that HR puts at the top of a job description. That would kind of explain the change in posts I have seen in this forum the past few years.

> It’s not BS if you understand what the role is. Some manager needs to make some changes so they can prove to their supervisors that they should keep getting promoted. **That manager can come up with their own plan, and if it fails, they’ll be blamed and limit their upward mobility. Alternatively, that manager could hire a consultant, and if the plan fails then clearly the consultant sucks so it shouldn’t limit their career trajectory.**

> If you think the game is telling business leaders things they don’t know about their business, yeah it’s bs and you probably will feel unfulfilled.

"It’s a good approach and how I’ve seen it done in the past.

Ceiling of the method is ultimately based on accuracy of the individual forecasts, which are going to fluctuate on intermittent cloudy days like you have seen.

Only suggestion I have is using interpretable ML models (try EBM from the interpretML python package) to better understand the ensembling on timestamps you are having issues.

For those forecasts, see which models it’s weighting the highest in the prediction.

Then check to see how each individual model forecast compares to the actual for that prediction.

If it’s weighing the most accurate model the highest, but the ensembling is still off, it’s prolly related to base NWP model error.

If it looks like it should be weighting other models higher, see if you can feature engineer your way into it weighting the models correctly in the situations you are having issues

Another suggestion would be to use some form of quantile regression. You can do it with lightGBM.

Forecast p(0.05), p(0.5), p(0.95). You’ll then have uncertainty intervals for your individual point predictions.  You can check to see if forecasts are biased towards either tail during the periods you are having issues. You’ll also likely that the diff between p(0.05) and p(0.95) forecasts are wider during the intermittent cloudy periods",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2emd3c2QzTXllc0l5TkxIaFlnZGw3akxaVjREclRPbkxfVEtBUVN5ZFB3Qy1jSzExTHlWS2lZYmJpWHptQW1nZ3hmRG1lOXhDSC1jLVJjRjRxWU5fSmo2NWJpaXV3YS1nSTYzTmt0YmtUYmc9

"I experience this sometimes in my work. In one particular problem, I ended up with a blend of the two. I hand selected features based on domain knowledge and tried to reduce collinearity (e.g. if 2 variables were highly correlated, I’d select the one that was more business relevant/ intuitive or rename it to capture the essence of both if possible).

From there, I built an elastic net model and tuned/validated using rolling time series out of sample predictions, but kept the regularization as low as possible to minimize bias on my coefficients.

For the output, I presented the “impact” of variables by multiplying their relevant z-score (say last week) by their coefficient. This is essentially what you’d do if predicting last weeks metrics, but I reported them individually rather than summing to provide the dependent variable. I believe this is done in mixed marketing models (though I don’t have experience with them).

It’s not a causal model and still prone to omitted variable bias, but it’ll give more intuition to stakeholders as to what’s happening behind the model.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2d1l1b3dvbUxURnE4WlVYNlhhdTJodDY4MFhOMlg3MlptdFFRVlBjNkE0VENEdENid2NCUHJHdkE4RjZyUHp3Q2V6N1hZWFowQkJXVjl3Mi15QUp1QnIzTDZoVFhtLThLUXk5YXU5TXNRdjQ9

But the short answer is almost all credit scoring models are logistic regression. The exceptions are at mega banks with gobs of data (I am talking 10s of millions customers) then XG Boost is sometimes used. Deep Learning is never used, because when you deny credit you have to give reason for why you denying and be usre that its not denying credit on the basis of race/gender/age etc. You might say your not doing credit scoring, but credit risk, but credit scoring is credit risk.

To me this feels generally still feels more in Alice's turf because of the holdout scores being key to the final model.

I suppose one way of framing this is whether one justifies a model a la - Alice - a nonparametric model justified by a holdout, or Bob - a parametric model justified by doing the best to satisfy all the parametric assumptions. Perhaps? In that sense, and in your example, I think Alice can still wield many of Bob's techniques but that final question can still lead to different models and explanations possibly.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2eHkwYUM2ZUgtWm5PYks1aVRPWFlDc2c2SVhKRVVHYWUxWnNJQkFJc25ZYnpyd0lsOFRSYzU2bXNlVWcxNzRSS0F4eDY4SU5UcGhOTnFob25lREZja0E9PQ==

"As someone who doesn't work in a tech firm but builds quantitative models, understands how AI works, and also an older millennial who remembers just how long it took for computers and the internet to fully integrate into society. You guys are expecting too much too fast and the entire tech industry is. This kind of technology takes decades to fully integrate. Gen AI has some very obvious productivity benefits, and most Americans hadn't even used chat gpt at the end of 2023 (Source: Pew)

I can tell you in my industry which makes up a massive 20 percent of GDP,  gen AI isn't even allowed for firmwide usage yet. Data privacy and other concerns have to be worked through. My firm is the industry leader for the space, so until its widely used here I doubt anyone else is following suit.  So how can you measure pay offs when most industries aren't even really using these things wide spread? 

Why would their be pay offs to foundational AI? When it isn't even significantly monetized yet ?

Tech firms in general have benefited a lot from easy finance from 2008 to 2022 and as a result the whole industry has adapted to basically hyping up every little project they do in order to attract investor dollars. If you want to understand how the world works, you basically should leave the bubble and start talking and reading what other people think.

AI isn't going to do everything the tech industry claims. It does however have very real productivity benefits (in forms of speeding up bureaucratic documentation work and hopefully becoming search on steroids), that will turn into tangible pay offs. But that isn't going to happen until its usage is widespread. That goes even more to current startup projects related to AI.

Again depends on use case. If you’re only predicting then use Alice’s model all day. If you need explanatory then Alice’s model is useless. The usefulness of Bob’s depends on what level of risk you’re willing to tolerate. I’ll take 90% accuracy in Bob’s model over just guessing. As that accuracy comes down I’m less likely to use Bob’s model. The risk is also situational.

That's an extremely strong and I'd argue unjustified take. I know plenty of colleagues who would do just as noted and extract some useful value out of it, and I have as well.

"You can't completely ignore predictive performance even when the target is inference, mostly because if you have bad predictive performance then your model is likely mis-specified. However, an inferential approach would not *optimize* for predictive performance since there are variables, when added as covariates, might distort the coefficient of interest (e.g. colliders). In a predictive context, however, it doesn't matter as long as it adds information. 

You also can't completely ignore explainability if looking from a prediction only perspective either, you might not care about the magnitude of effect, but you're interested in seeing what the model thinks are good, especially when you're considering complex black box models like NN. There are a lot of cautionary tales out there of people not looking at what the model is using to predict carefully esp. in the presence of systematic bias, such as those early radiology CNN papers where the model uses the background contrast. 

In your example, I would be worried for Bob if Bob's AUC is 0.5 and Alice's AUC is 0.8, and vice versa I will be worried for Alice if the AUC is 0.8, but the model decides the top feature is some useless metadata.

"Hey I appreciate this thought-out reply! I agree with you writ large, but troubling on some specifics:

>I will be worried for Alice if the AUC is 0.8, but the model decides the top feature is some useless metadata.

I guess I would feel that a well-specified problem (needed for both Alice and Bob) and a hold-out covers this fairly well. I also think implicit in both Alice and Bob's approach is making sure there's no features that are information leaks, which is a bit easier to say for forecasting event outcomes, than otherwise though.

>However, an inferential approach would not *optimize* for predictive performance since there are variables, when added as covariates, might distort the coefficient of interest (e.g. colliders)

You know I think pointing to the ""coefficient of interest"" is important and further specifies my confusion. Very often when I'm approached with a problem, that coefficient of interest doesn't really exist. It's usually just a wide-open door. So thinking of colliders, if there was a ""red car"" kind of problem a la in insurance, that would still be interesting and would just lead to further modeling to suss out what's going on there. In which case I think putting on Bob's hat is critical. Noteably though I guess that has me starting off as Alice, even if ending up as Bob.

>As a Bob, I will also defend Bob in the sense that Bob is not pulling a causal graph out of nowhere, and Bob will likely perform a lot of sensitivity analyses to ensure that this assumptions are at least not severely impacting his results.

I hear you. My hesitation here is perhaps simply that Bob's work is (I think) honestly a bit more complicated than Alice's, and it's easier to make a slip here because real world problems are so complicated and getting to do experiments is rare. So having optimized for performance first makes me feel like I have a much quicker attachment to empirical outcomes, from which it can be whittled to more specific business needs.

Yes and no. This is limited to how well a firm can capture and present data about each individuals state within the lifecycle, including (unknown) relevant external data that is influencing those users decisions at the current state. Outside of FAANG and firms with massive data purchase budgets, that ain’t happening and some parsimonious ad-lib style template will get them 80%+ where they need to be in terms of effect and ROI.

"Yes and no. What’s the utility? Take call volume off call center? Reduce “don’t get hit by a bus” effect in staffing?

We released a customer facing QA bot a few years back. No llm, but I’m sure the vendor who sold it to us is porting. 

Anyways, our performance metric for the solution revolved around decreasing call volume to the call center in hopes that would reduce some of the on-hold metrics: time on hold, count on hold, etc. Possibly, if it improved those metrics we might have been able to reduce call center staff, dial back after hours outsourcing (way more expensive than in house), etc. 

It did none of those things. We had to hire a team to baby sit the bot and specialize a whole role that reviews chat exceptions and labels those conversations so they can be added into the tuning dataset for the next version. 

None of the wait times improved. 

It ended up costing us way more than just not having it. Why? 

It seems customers in our industry don’t want to communicate with a guard rail bound bot. They want a human who can empathize and break the boundaries if needed to solve problems. They want real people, if not just because it makes them feel warm and fuzzy inside. They call because they’re lonely old codgers whose spouses died 5 years ago and their kids won’t visit - the nice lady at the call center always answers, always listens. They call because they’re fearful of something, and a human can sense that immediately and console them. They call out of habit and just can’t handle the digi-log version of a human on the other end. 

One might argue our system isn’t sophisticated enough. It’s not true.

"Was watching a marketing staff member generate voiceovers for a commercial. Problem, the more they regenerated the same lines with the same “voice” setting, the more it was obvious the output was not consistent. While generating can scale infinitely, one cannot use humans to discriminate infinitely at scale. 

Specific problem was that the commercial would be run in a geographic region with a heavy accent and documented and admitted xenophobia. They had to get an accent close to the regional accent and include colloquialisms and etc. 

They also ran into timing and cadence issues. If casting a human VO actor, they could’ve easily just said, “speed that part up, it’s gotta fit this 2 second limit.” The bot required them rewriting copy (something they were also using GenAI for).

1. On Alice’s well specified problem: I totally agree! If Alice did her due diligence and look at SHAP/VIMP values and ensure that there is no systematic issues with the data then there are no concerns with Alice. Similarly, a good Bob will also have to do the due diligence and assess model predictive performance.

2. On the coefficient of interest: I think you just haven’t worked in fields where this is the case. I work in health research (I am a biostatistician) and it is very common to have one specific effect of interest (e.g. treatment response) and the other variables are used to ensure that there are no confounding variables distorting that one covariate of interest.

"I don't think it's that cut and dry. There are some important activities where genAI already has a big impact - writing code is definitely one. It's not hype: developers can write higher quality code faster and with higher job satisfaction with an AI assistant. When broken down well, many tasks can be improved with genAI.

That last part is key. If you throw genAI onto the end of a process or just try and throw the whole process into context and get a completion, you'll get trash out. Even Google Search has fallen victim to this magic thinking, and they invented transformers (and modern search).

New technology has ups and downs.

"Hi,

I would argue that these are very different roles and you are missing some jobs. Let me try to identify the roles, their limitations and skills. I am sure many in the field will disagree, since it seems to have not yet settled and is somewhat subjective.

A Data Consultant is someone who's main job is to provide advice to (mostly external) customers on how to store and process data. My experience is that many consultants have a fixed set solutions they try to convince the customer with. They often organize or do the migrations from one solutions to another. Sometimes these are very spezialized solutions for certain domains or industry sectors. Bad consultants are just little more than sales reps with a some technical background.

A Data Engineer is actually a software engineer with the skills to develop solutions that can handle large amounts of organized und unorganized data. Data lakes and ETL pipelines is not only something they should be able to use, but something they should be able to develop, test and run. Data Engineers are also able to implement solutions to acquire or collect data. There a lot of admins moving into this field after as it can look like they don't need to code as much. The ability to code solutions makes the difference between a good or an excellent Data Engineer though. I recommend a Software Engineer who was an admin at some point.

A Data Scientist closely works with a Data Engineer, but they are not necessarily Software Engineers, although that makes them much better at their jobs. They are people who are able to analyse and interpret the data. They create the right (!) interpretation of statistics in the contexts of the business. They are also aware of the data's limitation and caveats. Biases are their arch nemesis and some would consider themselves as data wranglers or controllers depending on their industry. Often they are people who are good at creating reports and visualizations for management to make decisions. This person is also the data owner, but needs to understand their job security depends on the added value they provide, not on their technical irreplaceability or on their ability to make nice diagrams. They need to be flexible and communicative mathematicians with a business understanding. Rare breed. 

*Edit Here I cannot stress enough that Data Scientists CAN be the most valuable asset to a company. Excellent ones are Like unicorns. To be honest I have come across 2 people like that. They were both severly underpaid, underrated and talked down to by the CEO. Am anecdote: One guy saved the CEO millions by providing data that was contradicting the CEOs opinion about the market. CEO was not amused, kicked out the guy but followed what he had found in the data. Excellent Data Scientists can save companies. *

An AI/ML Scientist is a person who is able to train and develop completely new models for specific tasks. A ML Scientist understands the use case and selects or creates a model to be trained. They understand the difference between train, dev or validation, and test set. They work closely with the Data Team to get the right data. Together they need to come up with the data in the right quality. They will tell you the hyperparameters to run for inference. They will tell you what model to use, not the other way around. Management should stfu when it comes to the selection of the model. Even if it is trendy to use an LLM for everything right now. They will also tell you if an LLM is overkill and you should be using something smaller. They know why and how to use GPUs and when and why not. They will also tell you if ML is even the right solution for the problem. This person needs to be the most honest of them all. Blunt even... And a bit of a mad hatter really. Most have a PhD as a lot of theory goes into these models.

Getting the data right for the task is 90% of the work. Data Scientist and ML Scientist need to work closely together if they are not the same person in the project.

An AI Engineer is again a Software Engineer, but  with the skill to pick up a model from the AI Scientist or an open source one and use it to implement a product to solve the intended problem with it. Depending on the environment the people working as AI Engineers benefit from knowledge about cloud architecture and cloud administration. This requires quite a few years of software experience in my opinion to get any good at this. They are wizards and wise/trained beyond their years.

You see they all have slighlty different purposes and jobs. In reality people wear multiple hats. The best people in the field are those who can do or understand everything in the process, but have in-depth understanding of one part.

These are some of the roles that are being mentioned in MLOps (in contrast to DevOps).

So, which job to pick for a bright future? First of all, all of them are very expensive employees. Small and medium businesses probably won't hire Data and/AI Teams after the current hype(s). However, the demand for Data Scientist and AI Engineers will slighlty increase as more and more tools need/have AI in one way or the other. Model training as part of AI Research is something most companies cannot afford. They will tell their AI Engineers to use one of the open source models instead... And then get upset that it does not work for their use cases.
 And consultants... Well, Consultancy is always a thing but it will not be paid as well as the other jobs. Maybe their work will be taken over by an LLM Agent at some point?",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Sk85Z3cwNm0wczJXbm9DanFSTWkwcS1BVzBjc1ViTHdvTEtVdXFYTmV2WHprS2dhU3VMcjROLTcwSUxhMVNMSUN3SDNxeVFMeXFkUW9ZZ2V1T3lrSFE9PQ==

"TL:DR at the end.

I was fortunate to learn on-the-job for 1.5 years since I had to be ""full stack"" on a startup. So I got comfortable with using a cluster that was already set up and being managed.

On my new job I'm leading the set up and management (even though I'm using autopilot GKE) bc MLOps/infra is veeery early stages, to say the least. There's no one that knows more than I, and I don't know a whole lot lol.

On the learning resources, I don't consider myself a pro to tell you with certainty the best ones. But here's what I got:

- [This experienced dude](https://youtu.be/wXuSqFJVNQA?si=vYr7xX2rVktSImOa) goes through basics you should learn before k8s. You *can* be functional in k8s by just watching 10 min videos on this stuff (and helped by LLMs). Especially if there's a DevOps managing it for you. But here's what he recommends:

1 - Containerization (Docker)

2 - Cloud basics

3 - YAML

4 - Networking basics

5 - Linux

He links some courses on each of those. If you want to work on your foundation for productionizing apps, I'd also work on:

6 - SWE best practice for creating reliable and easy to maintain apps

7 - How to write production-level code in Python. It's VERY different from notebooks

8 - Monitoring tools: Prometheus, Logging (Python lib and your stacks' solution. Like Prometheus+Grafana or GCP Logs Explorer)

If you're able to grasp stuff like deep learning and stats, none of this is an issue. You just need time, and hopefully a job in which you can put this all to practice with some mentoring.

- The official [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) page is very rich and thorough. Albeit discouraging for most beginners. I'm eating it up though because I love the topic and already have many questions that arose from my own usage.
I get very bored with bureaucratic learning like manuals. So I just go through tutorials, use it, play with it, and then go back to docs with my own questions.
I've already done the former, so now this page is where I spend most of my time.

TL;DR:
- K8s official page is full of documentation and tutorials
- YouTube link has course suggestions from someone that knows better than me
- Don't be afraid of setting it up on your machine, playing with it, and using it on some projects to practice
- It's crucial if you want to put your models to good use instead of being stuck in ipynbs",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MEk4OEpCVFVpZUs3RE5PdVNXQjM5RXB5bWM1SDZQQlJ5dGdoOUJhWW9IRENzWDFvU3VVZEgzUVJybFVnSXpwb0lFdWQzcmhKQnktLVZBSktHdTRDZnc9PQ==

"I think the answer here entirely depends on what the data is. What is it you are trying to model by performing these regressions?

If you have one numerical output, and multiple inputs, and multiple categories, but you are only concerned about one of the inputs, a linear regression of that one input to the one output could be fine, and you could use the other data to demonstrate that you have a sufficiently broad set of those other values to show that they do not interfere with that one regression. Similarly, you could have a higher order regression with one input and and one output, or non-linear functions, but which function you chose should be base on an understanding of the two variables and their relationship to one another. 

Looking at only one input and one output could be especially valuable if there is only one input you can control (say in an engineering context, such as a pump speed) and you can monitor all the other variables.

You may alternatively use one input and one output, and then use the other variables to see whether you should have multiple analyses for different sets of conditions (say by performing a Principle Component Analysis, PCA).

If you have a dataset where there are multiple inputs and you want to model how they affect an output (or multiple outputs) there is a broad number of ways to examine this Multi Variate Analysis. A Multiple Linear Regression could be fine, but it is important to understand the assumptions for such models (independence, etc). If variables are not independent you could use PLS, but again understanding WHY you are using one method or another is very important.

The ""simplest"" way, conceptually (though not in practice) would be to slap every method in your dataset and see what sticks and gives you apparently useful information. I say ""apparently useful information"", as the real risk of just throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks is that you may build correlations that are arbitrary or spurious due to coincidences or collinearity in the data.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3QlA1WjFWekMtWnVReFNnZHNraTNyRUR1WnlaX1AzSVNJQWh4MThpLUsyV2JsZ1BGWmxFN2pNM1NSRjRqZmNzMlhmT2tDSXU0UFVrWnpQM2Q1OGZmdFE9PQ==

"Tableau dashboards, and those of similar tools, are one of the few ways in which you can really showcase a model (and its behavior and results) to business stakeholders. They are also kind of a cheatcode when working in projects, as for non-technical users a locally run model that outputs to a dashboard still counts as a deliverable. In my experience those dashboards can get you a promotion, but not necessarily the equivalent respect of your peers.

That said, if you want to do mainly Tableau it makes more sense to be the product/translater/analyst person in a data science team.

Larger companies can have several dashboard platforms in their environment.

"Hi everyone,

I'm finishing my Master's program in Data Science in two months and have about three years of experience as a MuleSoft developer, specializing in APIs and ETL integrations. Currently, I'm writing my dissertation and beginning to apply for jobs. As an international student, I will need to secure a work visa. I'm unsure if I qualify for a data scientist position as a newcomer to the field, since most job openings seek experienced individuals. Should I consider applying for data engineering or machine learning engineering roles instead? Additionally, I'm not particularly fond of the extensive statistics included in the degree. Are there any areas within data science that are less focused on statistics? I really enjoyed our modules on big data and would like to indulge more into cloud computing. Is there any area that brings both data science and cloud computing together?

Thank you!",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3YmRmS3FCNjl0bjBGTjNmZEJHN1Zaak1XU1dKczdGMjA4WE5kRm5tQXUyaFJibkU1aUdHY3BqSzR0U2FfdzdZV1JYenZwemJKU0UzdEpXYzd3cXY5aElIcVFaRVQ1UTVFTXBRZDFPLXZ6SHM9

"Hey!

If I understand your post correctly you are looking at this from a freelancer perspective? If so, you are probably serving small teams within big companies or smaller companies that want to do their AI/Data transition. 

If my assumption above is correct, I would say that data and AI are like peanut butter and jelly—they go hand in hand! So if you can position yourself as a data consultant who also rocks at AI, calling yourself a ""Data and AI Consultant"" totally makes sense. It shows these teams you’ve got the skills to handle both.

"It depends on what you're trying to do. If it's purely a prediction problem, then tree based methods like random forest or XG boost typically outperform most linear models. They are also easy to implement 

I typically only use linear/ polynomial regressions in instances where explaining how the model works is important. If that is the case, just know that as your model gets more complex, like going from a linear regression to a polynomial regression, it gets more challenging to explain to stakeholders how certain variables affect the predictor. One way you can identify if a polynomial regression would fit the data better is by looking for this pattern in the error terms of a linear regression.

"Anyone with any ounce of experience knows that the best mushrooms grow in bullshit, including mushrooms that help with hallucinations!

Trying to decipher the title and a few comments, because I’ve seen this report on a couple of different platforms now, my highly scientific assessment is that people are tired of nonsense or simplifications, or mistakes being called bullshit or hallucination, when bullshit is actually something that comes out of the anus of a bull, and hallucination is what you get when you consume hallucinogens like hallucinogenic mushrooms...

But if you put this all together, you don’t get hallucinations without bullshit, or cowshit, that can grow the mushrooms.

Actually, in business I heard a few times people described as 'mushrooms'.

That is, people who are kept in the dark, and fed shit. Where shit, in this sense of the word, is informational nonsense, and being kept in the dark, is to be lied to, or to be excluded from aspects of a business.

I haven’t read this paper, I skimmed a couple of paragraphs at the beginning, but I am curious about whether or not it mentions mushrooms, or the type of grass that bulls need to eat to produce the best bullshit for the best hallucinogenic mushrooms. 

Actually, I might finish by mentioning that it’s difficult to get store bought mushrooms that haven’t been grown on animal wastes. 

So, you can get mushrooms from bullshit, cowshit, and other sorts of shit, but you can also get mushrooms called 'wood mushrooms'.

These are mushrooms that grow from timber, fallen trees, or selected harvested wood that is seeded.

I think the classic wood mushroom in popular culture is called the 'shitake' mushroom. It is not hallucinogenic. I think it tends to be expensive, where I am, AU$50-AU$60 a kilogram.

"Yes, this is a common problem that companies face. This gets worse as the company gets bigger. Instead of departments, you have entire country sites with different definitions.

The scenario described is a classic symptom of poor data governance practices, particularly the lack of centralized business metadata.

LookML is a data modeling language and not specifically designed for metrics management. While it can help with data standardization, it might not be the best fit for centralizing and governing metrics definitions.

You have a few options depending on the company size and capabilities.

**Informal Solution**

* For the time being, you can have a dedicated team or person responsible for maintaining a centralized metrics dictionary or catalog. This can be a physical document, a wiki page, or even a dedicated platform like a metrics store.

**Formal solutions**

* Metrics catalog platforms like Metriql, Metricsstore, or Datacatalog, which provide a centralized repository for metrics definitions and calculation methodologies.
* Data governance platforms like Alation, Collibra, or Informatica, which offer features for metrics management and data cataloging.

Typically, it's a Data Governance team's job to work with business to get a consistent set of definitions. That can be a challenge given that each department has its own perspectives on definitions or have metrics that are native to their department.

"For sure, change it. The purpose and intent of HR titles is very different than the purpose for your resume.  Prioritize a title and clear description that will accurately communicate what you do, did and are capable of. A resume is a communication tool.  I say the same for LinkedIn. It's no ego, or vanity, or lying, it's clear communication and you deserve for people to understand what you do.  Titles are widely different across companies. With that, you can apply this same philosophy when looking for a job,  don't judge a role by its title. 

In addition to changing the title for communication, I think with reason, you can change to appeal to the company you apply for too. Don't change it to overplay what you can do, but If you notice the company likes engineer or analysts as part of there company language and culture,  update it so that you relate.

1. [Elements of Causal Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262037310/elements-of-causal-inference/) by Peters et al.
2. [Causal Inference: What if](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) by Robins & Hernan.

I have used both as references alongside Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/). Peters et al. is definitely harder to follow though. If I was starting from scratch, I would use suggest [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/), it is the smoothest read.

"They are light on the math. These are supplementary books.  graduate level economics students will take several courses on econometrics which basically cover the mathematics of linear regression in depth. 

Causal Inference as these books cover them are essentially research designs that set up contexts for where linear regression can be use to estimate the causal effect on X on Y. 

In a business context companies can actually generate these setups through experiments, i.e., pricing in different markets.

If you have a solid foundation in linear regression, I think your good for these books. If you don't. The simplest book on the subject would probably be wooldriges introductory  econometrics, which is an undergrad text that does not use linear algebra.

If you want something that's more rigorous Fumio Hayashi's econometrics is an elegant treatment on regression as a subset of GMM estimator. Davison and Mackinnon is a mathematics oriented treatment of regression, as a linear projection. It's elegant.

Hayashi does have sample code.

None of these books are code heavy.  Economists aren't trained in python and python has only become popular recently.

"> Most stats packages will have a way to automatically test it but it’s always good to test if each marketing strategy component is statistically significant vs the dependent variable.

This isn't necessarily relevant. Especially when the predictors are correlated, the univariate effects suffer from omitted variable bias. 

> If the t or f test comes back that the statistical significance of the marketing strategy is high, then you can reject the null hypothesis and can conclude that the marketing strategy has a level of significance or level of causation against the dependent variable (which would be sales). 

A standard t/F-test doesn't indicate causation any more than a measure of correlation.

> I’m sure I’m missing a whole bunch of other tests to check for heteroskedasticity (biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median), autocorrelation (data correlates with itself over time), and other issues that arise from running panel data. 

Assumptions should not be explicitly tested. For a wide variety of reasons, most of which are outlined in the context of normality testing [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2492/is-normality-testing-essentially-useless).

> heteroskedasticity (biased data that has outliers that separate the mean from the median)

"OK! Imbens & Rubin and Peters et al. are the most Maths heavy. Huntington-Klein has the ""best code"".

In general, the Maths side of things is not *the* most important. Informally, a standard Causal Inference project has four stages: 1. DAG creation, 2. Identification, 3. Estimation and 4. Refutation. While all stage involve some Maths, heavy Maths mostly revolve around stage 3. Maybe at Stage 1 too, if you choose to Causal Discovery. Identification and Refutation are pretty clear-cut for the most part. So yeah, I&R if you feel Mathsy!

That said, if you work at a startup, I believe you will come across many chances to do a lot more things that can be of value.

"If you are early in your career and substantial life circumstances aren’t pushing you to earn more, then take the long view on your career.

Here’s some tips from someone with 12 years of experience:

(1) It is enormously emotionally draining to have a very clear passion and to be doing work outside of that passion 

(2) Over the arc of your career, your focus on the soft and hard skills that will significantly increase the scale of your impact and correspond with promotions. Short term deviations into things that don’t grow your skills, even if they come with a pay bump, aren’t generally beneficial in the long run. You need a significant amount of motivation and hard work to climb the title and pay ladder and it is much easier if you are excited about the work. The one exception is if the role would open up doors that roles that match your interest cannot. For example, I took a role that doesn’t align with my long term passion but was with a top 5 tech company. After, I was on the radar of all the recruiters of top companies and have only been working in elite companies since then. 

(3) Aim to start building a network of data scientist you’ve meet at conferences, meet ups, or prior jobs that can help you make these types of decisions",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3T1VwMWdwVHk1U0JQdmI0dUt0Y0J0UnN4bUhzZHV6MEU5QzVFX3JRSGtJNGdQYnNtQWhTUGw3WjVIQm5oTER4VmNTN2QwVzlEdV9jRkgzNjNIbktXVUE9PQ==

Spent six months building reports from data that nobody had any confidence in, but little by little we've made small improvements and now we can say that we have a platform to build on. 

From a personal standpoint I spent the first 12 months getting maximum 4hrs sleep because I felt like I was terrible. Our governance was so bad that the problems were overwhelming and I didn't know how to start. 
I Wondered if I had made the right career move and dreaded work.


But then I got a new boss who is the most understanding and supportive guy I could ever have wished to have leading our team.
I'm now looking forward to the future instead of living in fear that I'm terrible at everything.
My reports are improving all the time and I feel like I'm ready to get going on the bigger problems - launching new apps which will give us better data. 

I would say your problem seems identical to mine. But I got lucky when we hired a guy whom I can call and have an open and frank discussion about problems and he doesn't judge me If the problem was easily fixed.

It feels very strange having worked as a DS for so long and only now getting imposter syndrome. In my case, the team I'm on seem to have no visible problems with their work.

I'm at the point where I feel they hired the wrong guy and I'm struggling to see how I can contribute given how unusual and messy the infrastructure and data is.

"This can happen when reporting isn't maintained and you get some filters that are no longer necessary or they change and no one updates the code.

The other thing could be a lack of knowledge of one of the parties. Maybe one does a distinct step just in case of dupes where the other was told there would only be one record for each order. Then things like this can change as systems change.

Finally different departments can have different rationale for calculating things differently or having different data sets. For instance customer surveys data I maintained had test surveys to test pilots or certain things. These data were excluded from say score cards for Frontline employees but might be used in those test case or other broad verbatim analysis.

For your example total orders does it include future orders that haven't happened yet? One group might want to recognize they've sold 100 orders when looking at sales however if you're in another group you may not want to recognize the order till you actually receive the money.

"Some companies have a policy that referrals have to be looked over, and the recruiter has to contact the person, and it's mandatory. Other companies, don't have this policy, so you can have a referral and nothing happens, or the recruiter looks at the resume, and ignores it.

Some companies get so many referrals, that it's impossible to look over every referrals. For ""campus"" recruiting (e.g. new grad, early career, internship), Google got so many referrals that now, they don't follow back on referrals and they don't give the referrer updates. Also, unless someone had an internship at google, campus referrals are basically ""I know this person because they are my friend or they went to my uni or I know they parent"", so my opinion is that this are unfair.

Also, referrers can write something about you on a referral most of the time. Are people writing something about you? Do they personally know you or have some connection? In small companies, it might not matter, but in larger companies it could matter (particularly if they get too many referrals).

"> Also, consider stability: a big pay bump for a role or company thar might disappear in 12-18 months is probably not worth it. 


 This is the big one for me. I had some time at a couple jobs where the pay was great, but if the company had one bad year they'd go under, or a bigger company that does layoffs. I hate starting over as a new guy, and it takes a solid year at a company often to *really* get settled, learn their systems and data and who to talk with for X and Y. 


 Now I'd much prefer a company where I can stay for an extended period and feel secure I won't be looking for another job next year. Pay is a bit worse, but I've got a pension and more PTO, and have lots of coworkers that have all been there for a decade or two so I'm not worried about going anywhere.


I've done the startup thing and it's not fun work. So much setting up infrastructure and some dashboards, but not fun mathy stuff or ML, they didn't have time for it. Pay was good, but it was constant fires of things not working, and just trying to keep the ship afloat. And from all my friends that also went that route, most don't last past a couple years.

Consider reaching out to people who were ahead of you in school and have been in jobs for longer or attend the same meetups/networking events over and over again so that you can build deeper relationships with people.

"What roles are you applying to? I don't see many skills or experience beyond data pulling, exploring, and some analysis / visualization. All very basic minimum requirements for data science. I don't see statistics or machine learning results in your experience, just some vague allusions to it which is a red flag. The experiences overall feel lacking when it's worded this way.

1) Core implications of the CLT
2) what's p value and the intuition behind it 
3) RCT and the core assumptions around it
4) Intervals and the intuition behind it
5) Design of experiments, sample size estimation, power
6) Describe t-tests with reasonable depth (why not a z test, Welch vs student's,etc)
      
Moves someone from OK to solid (any one might do the trick):
1) Observational studies (PSM, IV designs)
2) Familiarity with Slightly more advanced causal inference ( DiD, Regression studies) - you need not have done it, but know about the broad concept 
3) Multiple comparisons 
4) Non parametric tests and why to use them
5) Some familiarity with Bayesian stats 
6) some.familiarity with naive bootstrap based testing 
7) Delta method 
8) Cuped
9) testing for metrics that aren't mean (quantiles, winsorised means, etc).

Very likey you're going to need to do a personal project that has results like a useful web app you make yourself or a project that makes a difference for some business or your university you have a relationship with. Toy/school projects like these you have so far will rarely get you a job and when they make up your whole resume it's a red flag for a company especially with the tight hiring budgets today.

For anything causal related, I get worried if people seem to be applying a recipe. I like it when people try to think through the mechanisms they're explaining, take time to understand the process they're modeling, and *then* apply some sort of method.

"Here’s how I’ll approach this challenge!

First, I'd like to clarify that estimating the incremental impact of a new product is a classic problem in econometrics and data science. To approach this challenge, I'd follow a structured approach:

*Step 1: Define the problem and objectives*
What specific product are we considering? What's the target market? What's the goal - revenue growth, market share increase, or customer acquisition?

*Step 2: Gather data*
Collect relevant data on:

- Historical sales and revenue
- Market research and consumer surveys
- Competitor sales and market share
- Seasonality and trends
- Product features and pricing

*Step 3: Explore and visualize data*
Analyze and visualize the data to:

- Identify patterns and correlations
- Understand consumer behavior and preferences
- Detect potential biases or outliers

*Step 4: Feature engineering*
Create relevant features to capture the relationships between variables, such as:

- Product category dummies
- Seasonality indicators
- Price and promotion variables
- Consumer demographics and preferences

*Step 5: Model selection and estimation*
Choose appropriate models to estimate demand and incremental impact, such as:

- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- ARIMA or Prophet for time series forecasting

*Step 6: Model evaluation and validation*
Assess the performance of each model using metrics like:

- Mean absolute error (MAE)
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- R-squared
- Cross-validation

*Step 7: Simulation and scenario analysis*
Use the selected models to simulate different scenarios, such as:

- Different pricing strategies
- Marketing campaigns
- Supply chain disruptions

*Step 8: Interpret results and communicate insights*
Present the findings in a clear and actionable way, highlighting the estimated incremental impact of the new product on revenue, sales, and customer acquisition.

Throughout the process, I'd collaborate with stakeholders to ensure the approach aligns with business objectives and that the insights are actionable.

"I would go down one of two routes:
1. Use historical data from past launches and modify it to suit expectations for the new product
2. Launch the new product to a subgroup from which you can extrapolate performance of a full launch (A/B test, in other words).

For the historical data, look at past product launches. You want to ideally find a similar product, but it will never be perfect so just do the best you can. Also remember when you mode the impact of the new product you should take into account:

- differences between the customer base now and when past products were sold
- seasonality, such as time of year
- difference in the selling price and repeat purchase rates (people will repurchase toilet paper more than a tv)

The more recent and relevant the past launches are, the more convincing the forecast will be.

If you go the A/B test route, what you’re doing is basically a limited launch. So you want to be very intentional about the audience you launch to so you can extrapolate the results to your entire customer base.

This means the test group should have similar demographics and purchasing patterns, and be large enough to be statistically significant.

Also pay attention to how you notify the test group of the new product and what the adoption rate is - if you just make something available on a website for the test, but for the real launch you have a ton of marketing and awareness building, you’ll get different results.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SW5UWnk0UnE0MExmSC1CWG9CZnhnRXRaOHZ0UHFveUFyTE5CVzBFdXdjVXpUbWxvWDl4S1VxRjlsRlRDN1dQR0xLeHdscWItRWdva29KcjIxMWdqNEE9PQ==

Similarly, you can ask it e.g. ""Give me methods for how to solve kinematics in rigid body mechanics as taught in mechanical engineering courses with multiple degrees of freedom. Provide an algorithm. Provide an example for a system with 4 DOF"" or ""What methods can I use to solve an oscillating electrical circuit using Kirchoff laws""

**or** - and this is the best example for making my point - ""I'm working with simulink to create a software component that holds 4 different states based on a velocity signal threshold. The state increases to a higher state every time another threshold is exceeded but only goes back to state0 once zero velocity is used. Suggest how to implement this? Consider both a simulink model and stateflow. Provide reasoning."" and subsequent ""can this be implement solely in stateflow?"".

It's in my opinion clear that the architecture shows some emergent behavior that goes deeper than only prediction next words. We can discuss whether the output can be valuable in any way but it's IMO not merely ""writing a document that looks like the one it's intended to summarize."" It's taking information from its training data and attempting to combine it in a linear way to fit user's query.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4WDViTTRnUWhsRFhQdVJnNVQ3WmhFNjNDcThKZzVnTVRtc3JNaDVUTmd3UmZxLVpJbGN1ak5XczVXUmNQR3lSQV9GaF9QaVFfRFp4TnFPNGJKaS1EQzRreHVaWGhZWlFFcVhrY3l6VHRZWjg9

"Do you know how retrieval augmented generation works? The very simple answer is that they feed the user's question into a traditional search engine, then put the search results and the query into the LLM, so that the LLM has more than the initial training data to use. The domain knowledge isn't necessarily part of the training data.

So again, the LLM is, very literally, not doing a search. The search is done by a traditional engine, and then the LLM ""summarizes"" it.

LLMs may demonstrate emergent phenomena, but under the hood, they do not engage in anything that resembles human cognition.

"**Do you have any other offers on the table?** Because my immediate question would be ""why does someone want to give you a 50% bump to do analytics?"". Meaning, there are two possibilities - either your market value is that 50% more you're being offered, or alternatively that company is making a bad choice offering you that much money.

Why does that matter? Because if your market value is 50% more than what you make, then I would just wait for a role that is a better fit and offers you about that much. But if they're making a bad choice, then you can think of it one of two ways:

1. You should take it asap because no one else is going to offer that and I don't care how much money you make, 50% is a *lot* more money. And understand that a 50% bump will likely have a cumulative impact over the rest of your career.

"But that's pretty much what RAGs do, though. 

Yes, a more traditional search engine feeds them relevant documents but then the RAG is used to retrieve information from the papers based on users query - it is, again, essentially searching the information we fed it and picking some specific knowledge the user is requesting. I'm not sure if we're arguing about sematics here or you don't agree with what I wrote above.

Do you disagree with the above?

>LLMs may demonstrate emergent phenomena, but under the hood, they do not engage in anything that resembles human cognition. There is a reason they're called ""stochastic parrots"".

I never said that it resembles human cognition.

But I've already given several examples to back up my point - a LLM somehow stores information provided to it in the training dataset (or whatever you choose to feed to a RAG) and it can the retrieve relevant chunks of information and return it to the user. 

Do we have a disagrement here?

>So again, the LLM is, very literally, not doing a search. The search is done by a traditional engine, and then the LLM ""summarizes"" it.

It is not a conventional search engine like Google but I also never said it was a search engine. Since my first comment I only stated that it does some sort of search over information (in an abstract sense, not literally) that has been provided to it and returns relevant chunks (or some simple combinations of relevant chunks).

">Yes, a more traditional search engine feeds them relevant documents but then the RAG is used to retrieve information from the papers based on users query - it is, again, essentially searching the information we fed it and picking some specific knowledge the user is requesting.

The issue is that you're saying that the LLM retrieves information. At the most basic computational level, this is not correct. There's a reason it's called generative AI - because it generates new text based on input (strictly speaking I know it's a transformer, but that is probably too nuanced here).

I'll grant that this might seem like semantics, but it's actually the crux of how these large language models work. Because the text is so good and human-sounding, we all have a tendency to ascribe deeper thinking or action to the models. But that's really not what's happening. The LLM is not retrieving information, certainly not in an information theory sense. It is using the original result and prompt to generate a new document - which, most of the time, contains a subset of the information that was in the input. If it was truly doing retrieval/search, then that ""most of the time"" would be ""always"".

So yes, we do have a disagreement (a friendly one I hope) about the characterization of the model as storing and retrieving information. The reason I brought up human cognition is that we all, myself included, have a tendency to project human thought processes onto the model. In this case I think that hinders our understanding of what the model actually does.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4U3V4LVZEQU9hRjE3UHJHSDVkMFRKcFNLbTd2Q3ZYNlR6MmJaUUotWlNEVTFsOGQxbUZ5RzZaTTNZVTB3U1QyQXE0ZjJoMkttNUQyZkdXM1lDSVVrUnc9PQ==

My advice would be to focus less on the classes (these should all be fairly straight forward anyways if you have a data background) and focus more on connecting with professors and other students and asking informed questions.

"Nah man, we can just disagree here.

MS in DA (stand alone) is lower, to me, than a BA in Stats, a BBA in a field of choice (if appropriate), or a BS in CS. I can teach the stuff you get in an MS DA pretty quickly. I can't teach solid understanding of programming logic, statistical logic, or business logic as easily or quickly.

Someone who went to a bootcamp is better than someone who is identical in all other ways but did not go to the bootcamp. But I would argue not to hit a bootcamp unless you just need a specific skill rounded out.

"Did an MSBA which was heavy on econometrics.

> 1. Did your courses actually teach you technical skills?

Not enough to clear every interview even at new grad level, but I did get a minimum baseline via homework and projects. We also had a programming class, but it was at a basic level.

> 2. Did you have to teach yourself almost everything?

This is grad classes in general. Lectures give you a basic idea, then send you home to work out details. The idea is that you really get a handle on the concepts by discovering them yourself, at a level you'd dismiss if you just copied. In a way it's practice for research. Eventually you do get stuck, and that's where hints in office hours or class discussion boards help.

Lecture notes are your best friend and will also help with interview prep years later. Textbooks are hit and miss. Online resources are an important supplement.

> 3. Would you recommend your program to others?

YMMV. As a way to learn, it fit me well. But that's not what we're really talking about about, is it?

Did it get me a job? It was enough to start in big tech, but not in a conventional way: I wasn't getting almost any DS interviews. I was near the top of my cohort in terms of GPA, but I didn't have fancy internships, so recruiters weren't taking a chance on me. My university was outstanding but only in ratings that didn't consider research, which is to say it wasn't ranked on the most mainstream lists, so pedigree wasn't there either. I ended up with one of the two positions that were hiring based on our industry projects in the program.

Did it help my career long term? I see the statistics understanding as a minimum qualification, and it gave me basic exposure to ML. And recruiters really do take the masters or PhD qualification seriously when screening resumes. So in that sense, yes, absolutely. But had I already worked in ML before that, idk if it would've been as necessary.

In any event, I later found myself pushing in the engineering direction anyway. To do the work I wanted to do within DS, it wasn't enough. Went back for a CS masters, and am happy with what I learned. This didn't majorly affect my prospects since I already had a DS resume.

> 4. Do you think a Masters in data analytics is worth getting?

"Why are you comparing a BS and MS? Of course a BS will be a higher quality but you can’t get into a MS without a BS or BA in the first place.

I mean ROI for any masters program is hard to measure what is the ROI on a MBA? Masters degrees are about networking and that can be incredibly valuable but hard to quantify. If you don’t network then any MS is practically useless. 

When every industry is hiring more people with masters degrees, it isn’t a bad idea to get ahead of the inevitable.

"I did a MS in Industrial Engineering at the University of Florida. The program allows for almost all electives 8 of the 10 courses I took were geared towards data analytics, ML, databases, operations research, and computational fairness.

1. Yes many courses did teach technical skills such as implementation of ML algos, analytics, dashboards, and SQL but I would say the courses that taught those concepts had a greater focus on the theory and fundamentals. I actually liked this, as the hard skills are easier to learn and practice with enough self-disciple, compared to theoretical concepts.

2. Most course resources were very helpful but they were almost never enough and asking LLM’s, googling, finding more literature, etc was necessary for every single class to gain a true understanding.

3. I would not recommend my program to others. It’s simply not a reputable DS graduate degree. For learning purposes, I was definitely able to learn a ton and was incredibly helpful at helping me gain more skills prior to beginning my full-time job. Also, many DS roles require a masters and it did open more doors simply from having the graduate degree.

4. I think it is worth it because of the exact reasons you stated. The field is saturated and a graduate degree gives you an advantage over many candidates.

It's really focused on Bayesian, but gives you a good background on frequentist standards. Hands on examples are all in R.

"I did the MISM-BIDA at CMU. I'll stick to the numbers of your questions just so this stays organized.

1. Yes. SQL, Python, linear algebra, statistics, machine learning, etc. I came in with a finance background but no previous technical skills. I took a couple prerequisites the summer before but that was it. I won't say it's easy but it was doable.

2. Resources were very helpful. People that skipped class were stupid IMO. Ignoring that you're spending a lot of money and just wasting it, the professor has prepared slides/examples/code/math proofs and they are just giving it to you instead of you having to figure out all out yourself. Most professors had slide decks, the primary ML professor actually had 10-15 page pdfs that were dense with math of how models actually optimized. I saved those on my hard drive and have been meaning to go back and read it again, it was that good.

3. Absolutely. It got me my internship, which got me my first job. The brand name alone of CMU has helped me a lot. Even if I did the same exact program/everything at a different school, having a high powered name on your resume helps (if you can swing it). I didn't use ratemyprofessor or whatever the younglings are using these days but I did in undergrad. It's a dogshit site because, like yelp, people only post when they have a bad experience. I used it every semester and I'd guess I only ever reviewed 1 professor. Grad school was smaller in the sense that the senior cohort or one of my classmates had already taken a class with that professor and I could ask them or it was just a mandatory class with that professor and I didn't really have a choice.

4. I think it's going to become really important if you're serious about data analytics. The rise of boot camps and certifications means that no one is able to tell what's good and what's crap and therefore won't waste time trying to figure out the difference and everything will be assumed crap until proven otherwise. A masters shows you were smart enough to do a masters, dedicated enough to actually finish the thing, and committed time that could have gone to working (about half my program left previous employment to do the masters. They lost a year and a half of income before they paid any tuition). Also a lot of big companies might say they're open to non-traditional candidates but at the end of the day they still want to see a degree and degrees are an easy way to weed out a bunch of applicants when you have hundreds.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4cjV4LUpISk5oaVY2YTVOeWQ4SjFhNGFiYUs5bkluajlfUmUxVVdBRWVZWklPMUtnai0yaDJ4NnpnRGUxVmllMkdOUENWQy11X3NoU1hHd3JKWWUtaVE9PQ==
"This sounds like my program too. I'd guess we spent 80-90% of the time we were studying ""machine learning"" looking at math and then the last 10% was the TA giving us some example code. It's kind of wild to me that you can ""build"" a machine learning model in SKLearn in 5-10 lines so the differentiating factor becomes ""do you know how to choose a model beyond trying them all and see what does best"" and ""what each model actually does and optimizes for.""

"I did a statistics program at a flagship state school

1. They taught technical skills but it wasn't perfect. A lot of redundancy between courses and a lot that I never learned that I felt I should have. I will say, however, that I felt I was set up to learn on my own effectively.
2. Depended on the course. Some courses were structured great, others I had to fill in a lot of gaps that I felt I shouldn't have had to. I learned a lot in all of them, however.
3. Yes, but only because it was cheap. I obviously haven't gotten a degree at any other programs, but I would imagine a lot were better than mine and if money was no object I think I could've found a better program.
4. I don't have an MS in DA so I can't say. I can say that my MS in statistics has been massive for me. It almost doubled my salary, led to a lot of career progression, and now that I'm unemployed I know it really helps me stand out from other applicants in a tough market.

additional comment: I wish I would've learned more coding and CS skills. Obviously I learned how to run analyses in SAS, R, and Python, but as a applicant gunning for DA, DS, and especially DE roles, I feel I really am lacking on the engineering front. I don't really know what I don't know, so it seems like a stretch for me to be able to teach myself.

I would get a masters in the field you want to be in for a long time because that masters will have people in that field so it will allow you to network with them to break into the field that interests you.

"Did my Masters in Data Analytics with a major in AI at Western University. The course in itself is presented as a cross between statistics and computer science but I would say in reality it's only for people with stats maths background to learn coding. 

The majority of my batch ended up being a data scientist but there is a huge gap between what they teach and what actually is needed in the industry. It only makes you skilled enough to build models and understand how data science works but lacks any teaching to make AI ML products that can be used as a production application. 

I had 3 years of software engineering experience before and put together with the Masters, I chose to work in the ML engineering and Data Engineering space as I was not feeling confident that I will do justice to being a DS.

1. Absolutely, it was very rigorous. Algorithm, statistical inference, ML, time series. Professor showed proofs in class and it as very math heavy. I liked it.

"I NEED A STRAIGHT FORWARD ANSWER EVEN IF IT IS BAD.
I have a double major in Chemistry and Biotechnology and I wanted to go for bioinformatics for my masters which introduced me to Python and Machine learning. I found bioinformatics a bit boring so I shifted to machine learning instead. 
I started off with simple python coding then learning about machine learning algorithms using YouTube videos and online courses and I also studied about different statistical concepts used. Then I learnt a little SQL and I ended up getting two internships - one industrial and one for a research project. I learnt a lot more during these internships with real life projects. 

I applied for several jobs related to data analytics and data science after this but all ended up rejecting me or not replying. I don't understand what I am doing wrong. Is it my degree? Is it my resume? Is it my lack of knowledge? Do I need to learn about more tools?

"Currently 10+ yrs work exp in finance, have the main degrees and biggest certifications

My selling point has always been understanding the data and technological side behind how things work in this space. (Some CS in HS) Can easily write scripts to query DB A, DB B, clean to merge, reorganize, do calcs, write to DB C, and then point a visualization tool at it.  Mainly with python np/pandas, have done with R and SAS in past.

More and more finding myself in situations where rather than go to the ""true"" developers, it's easier for both the business (and myself) to just write up a script to solve the immediate need.  And many times when interfacing with a dev, I'm teaching them where to go for the info and what the calculations should be.

"OMSCS grad and hiring manager.

1. No, no relevant skills for the current job market / environment. Almost nothing you learn will be a requirement on job apps. A few thing maybe, but not most.
2. 50-50 here. It's mainly self directed. Some courses were straight garbage (Grad Algos)
3. I would not recommend any analytics or data science masters. They carry extremely little weight compared to relevant job experience.
4. No. Maybe CS is 'worth' it. But here's the think, they all (especially OMSCS) take an extraordinary amount of time and have very little to show for it. You're better off doing 2-3 personal projects that solve meaningful business problems in a domain area you have previous experience in. I would take that candidate over a masters any day.

I have actually told my HR that I'd rather have 1 or 2 offshore SWEs than 1 junior DS/DA/etc. The offshore guys are awesome, they don't distract me during the day, they ask off-shore coworkers trivial issues instead of me, I assign them work and show up the next day and it's done. A good offshroe guy with work experience, that can be self-directed, and has access to any sort of coding LLM is better and cheaper than on-shore junior.

Literally we hired a off-shore senior data analyst who told us in the interview he didn't know python. We've given him ONLY pyspark and python library dev work and he's crushed it.

">**Did you have to teach yourself almost everything?** 

Isn't this called ""studying""? 

There is basically a limited amount of time in class and for a 3 credit course, you are supposed to be studying 9 hours per week outside of class. That includes completing all the readings, looking for anything you have a gap, revising the lectures, and doing assignments. 

You are 3 semesters in. It's a waste of time to go to another program.

> So far the highest rated professor I've taken has been a 2.6 or something

I don't know who the professors are, but professors at R1 do research. They are not the college professor at a SLAC that only focuses on teaching and that's what they are evaluated on. So even if you did a MS in CS at Stanford or wherever else, a professor is not going to put all of their effort in teaching. That's is why you are there. Maybe once in a while you get someone who is an extraordinary communicator, but that's rare.

I'm very unsurprised. I work for a very large non-tech company in a technical role and every other day it seems like theres some big brand new idea for using genAI (and other AI tools) but I still havent seen where these projects lead. It seems they rarely get far enough into production to have any substantial business impact. Everyone's hopping on the bandwagon to join these projects cuz of the hype but (in my experience at least) the delivery of these ideas always ends up poorly executed. Seems like every manager wants to be lauded for bringing AI into the company without doing the difficult work of hiring the right people and evaluating the cost and impact in more than vague terms.,r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDUVBvSkFib2xsa0NIdTJCOEJXeTRGdkh6STk2S1FZbkNXZmZPdUptT2U3Tnp5SDNMRHpZQV9hUjNkbHZieF9BU0lPSU53VllYYkI3Z2FhN3YyazRSU2c9PQ==

"It's usually a business metric being considered. Also, real world use cases usually require some balance of precision/recall since predictions require a corresponding call to action or serving process to go with it and resources for these aren't infinite.

Example: Churn prediction. You don't have enough customer care specialists to cover all cases so you might try to keep false positives at some acceptable level even though that means false negatives will be higher. Also, in this case you're probably going to prefer a model that has higher AUC under the Precision-Recall curve, meaning it offers you a better trade-off between false positives and false negatives so you can allocate resources better.

There are also models that don't perform particularly accurately but if it keeps users on a platform longer and create a wider funnel for downstream stuff then that could be valuable too.

Example: Content recommender might not predict with very high confidence that the user will watch any of the content shown, but maybe it delivers novel enough content that a user will keep scrolling for more options, thereby increasing time spent on platform and more ads viewed.

And then finally even if you would normally use a t-test, if you see a non-statistically significant 1% improvement in your bottom line, are you really going to recommend switching to the previous model? I think your question applies more to biomedical settings where it's more like ok rolling out a treatment with a 1% non-statistically significant improvement is a huge waste of resources so we won't do that.

"thanks for this

i think given your good inputs here and sharing of use cases

i think the question for me is that: are we really improving in direction? because if not, we can possibly let's check our methodologies

i think even precision (and recall) can be ""resampled"" or ""bootstrapped"" to see if the mean precision of the new model is actually better than the mean precision of old model (knowing the variances of precisions from the new and old models)

if we don't check, there could be a high probability that we could be going in circles in the big picture thru these iterative improvements that aren't actually statistically sound yet

"Honestly trial and error. If I'm not limited by Seaborn plotting functions I'll use that and then matplotlib utilities to set everything else. But I got some pure matplotlib ones for automated reporting.

Most of the time, it's just playing with colors, font type/size and chopping up the plot frame. Matplotlib defaults suck.

First thing is make spines not visible if not required. Crazy how much this make a difference.

Have a custom colour scheme, there are resources for this but I use my companies branding guide typically. Otherwise the xkcd color library isn't bad.

"Statistical Rethinking by Richard Mclearth - as mentioned by other posters - is very good. 

Regression and Other Stories by Gelman and Hill (also mentioned by other posters) is the one statistics/methods book I would have if trapped on an island. Here is a  [link](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) to the free online version.

While both focus somewhat on casual inference, if you are interested in learning more about causal inference I recommend:

The Effect by Nick Huntington-Klein. It is available for [free](https://www.theeffectbook.net) and is very approachable. 

Causal Inference the Mixtape is also quite good, but is less approachabke than The Effect. It is also available for [free](https://mixtape.scunning.com).

For machine learning I have heard great things about An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James et al. Heres a [link](https://www.statlearning.com) to the free first and second editions with code in R and Python.

All of these recommendations are more applied statistics and are not necessarily math and theory heavy if thats what you want.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDVmhhY3g5RXVzZGdiS3VQWlJJT3FVdDJjMjMyREpyQ2JqNWhFeW9hNFlWaGQwVFExa0I4d3RSWkVINENMUlZDMlVoa201QUY5T3Bkcm5maFZienpua0E9PQ==

But usually you just check your order of magnitude and be done with it. And usually you only really care about this at all if you're comparing to a dummy model or something like that.

"You're not really missing anything, you're just under-valuing the benefits.

You try a bunch of different hyperparameters or try different models and you want to use the one that does best. Best is difficult to be sure about though because there are uncertainties on the value of your metrics. You can counter this with cross-validation or bootstrap sampling so people do this.

If your validation set is large enough the uncertainty on your error metric is very low and this becomes unnecessary. However, this is a really unusual situation! For you to be sure your uncertainties on your metrics are so small that any perceived difference between hyper-parameters is really is a high bar and not one you will often run into.

"Hi everyone,

I'm finishing my Master's program in Data Science in two months and have about three years of experience as a MuleSoft developer, specializing in APIs and ETL integrations. Currently, I'm writing my dissertation and beginning to apply for jobs. As an international student, I will need to secure a work visa. I'm unsure if I qualify for a data scientist position as a newcomer to the field, since most job openings seek experienced individuals. Should I consider applying for data engineering or machine learning engineering roles instead? Additionally, I'm not particularly fond of the extensive statistics included in the degree. Are there any areas within data science that are less focused on statistics? I really enjoyed our modules on big data and would like to indulge more into cloud computing. Is there any area that brings both data science and cloud computing together?

"IVs still remain indispensable for demand estimation outside of a context where you have experimental variation in prices. Presumably firms running a data science team can readily produce experimental variation in their own prices (although not the prices of competitor goods/services) and use that in conjunction with a supply shifter to get a decent first stage on a demand system. Not ideal but almost everything in IO needs an IV and we still haven’t done a good job of finding decent ones (BLP instruments — yuck).

"I can appreciate your defense of the role of IVs in the IO setting, and I can agree that while weak IVs can still provide some insight, they aren't the most reliable tool for many practical applications.

I am a third year computer science student at the lebanese International  university , and I want to pursue  my education in the field of data science and ai. So for that , I want to create a data science / machine learning related project as for my senior project, but I have no idea where to start in data science or what project should I start with. I really need some advice for this matter, I want to make an outstanding  project and become proficient in data science, but I am truly lost and I don't know where and how to start. 

Thank you all in advance , I hope you have a great day/night <3.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOTl5czhCOVctc0VJMF93MkdxN1M0NndzMHZ4MmktdnRkRWVoXzJnTEFaTGdpZGVLTF82aGlfaV84bThXQXFEQlBpNFpYeUhxbVRUMHhRbXd5VDhOcjNNZlVaMFZJa2FWY3pCZldXQko2UVU9

"Basically, Blockchain was a way of executing database 'insert' commands.  These commands were mathematically invertible.  Meaning that it kept receipts and that you could always verify that the 'insert' command happened from this IP address and that the record was created Over Here.  The method relied upon a security token that had to be constantly verified to 'prove' that the database metadata was accurate.  The token authenticated the record and identified who 'owned' the database insert command.

The overhead of the security creates a significant inefficiency ($$$ and electricity) compared to existing databases, and the problem it solves -- fully auditable database insert commands in perpetuity -- is not a problem that anyone actually has in conducting business.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYWtJcmVoTmNDRi10bDlIOVhKUjQwbEdDb1ZsOHRPOVpSWlRYUWdXX2drMkRjWmFESXBCM25IMkVzTkdvNm9CenQ2NGNYTGE4bk5xSk03WUYzQTdxZlE9PQ==

"When tackling the challenge of building an effective image classifier for a reselling marketplace, it's crucial to start with a solid foundation: a clean and well-curated dataset. Your initial step should be to validate and clean the existing 300k images, which likely contain mislabeled and low-quality entries. Automated tools such as Amazon Rekognition or Google Cloud Vision can swiftly scan and flag images that are blurry, poorly lit, or incorrectly labeled, making the initial culling process more efficient. Complement this with a manual review process, perhaps using crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, where multiple reviewers can verify each image’s label, ensuring accuracy through consensus.

Once the dataset is cleaner, enhancing data quality through augmentation techniques becomes essential. Libraries such as `imgaug` or `albumentations` can help create variations of your existing images through rotations, flips, crops, and color adjustments, thereby enriching the dataset without additional data collection efforts. Given the hierarchical nature of your labels, structuring your classifier to respect this hierarchy is vital. Consider a multi-level model approach where separate models are trained for each hierarchical level, or a tree-based model where broad categories are handled by the root node, and specific subcategories are managed by child nodes. Implementing transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or Inception and fine-tuning them for your hierarchical labels can significantly boost your classifier's performance, especially in the face of noisy data.

Continuously evaluating and refining your model is key. Utilize hierarchical precision, recall, and F1 scores to measure performance accurately across different levels of your label hierarchy. This ongoing process should include regular reviews and cleaning of your dataset, retraining of models, and adjustments based on the insights gained from these metrics. Expanding your dataset with high-quality images from external sources that fit your label hierarchy and maintaining a robust validation set will ensure your model's effectiveness. By iterating on these steps, you'll build a powerful, accurate image classifier that can handle the complexities of a reselling marketplace.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT0NvY3Z1QTFXcGppUThsQmtEUzBpS0g1ci1SQ2hwZ1UxdGtMRHN2VGJMaGpjZ041ekRMWWtyR2tCWXJJanZHR2dFZDh6THRLT3Q1VFgyc0RuV3JpRkE9PQ==

 If someone say clones a world leader speaking and posts it online, agencies will be able to prove whether they said or didnt say those words if the orginal video is encoded into the blockchain either by cryptographic hash that just points and says which is the correct video or having the entire video loaded in (a database wouldn't be trusted source as much as an immutable public record).

"That’s a pretty impressive project! 

Few years ago (2014 to 2018) I did almost the exactly same thing as you (trueskill, data augumentation, backtesting, machine learning models, Kelly criterion…) and even the result was almost the same (0.7ish auc) but for ATP/WTA Tennis matches.

The final conclusion was that statistics can only do so much to a point where there is no performance increase no matter what you do. 

The natural randomness from the human sports, the fact the the betting platform can do almost the same or even better with live data and that they controls the monetary return, the platform will always have an advantage and the math guarantee that you will loose money in the long run.

"Thats a hard straw man arguement, VHS was not build for privacy so why does it enter the discussion but since we are here. 

Porn is actually a great predictor of what society will be doing because they are usually a head of their time in terms of communication and distribution because they have some of the most pressing need to widely distribute their material and have ready available buyers to do it. They led the VCR and home video movement and were also the first to put content on the internet, the started putting up internet content in 1995 10 years before youtube was created, they were the first to make online transactions with credit cards available. 

Where porn goes the world often follows, every letter in FAANG uses some of the technology that Porn companies were the first movers on (internet content, online transactions, home video and entertainment, video streaming). One can say that Porn companies were the first movers on technology that makes a over 50% of the current s&p 500 value.

We are all data scientists here, or aspiring data scientist when there is a linear or exponential trend of multiple points over the span of over 50+ years its not unreasonable to assume linearity and do a regression something may change but we have strong evidence it probably wont. Coincidentally Porn companies were also one of the first to adapt bitcoin and crypto as a transaction medium. Odds are that may become a standard of transaction in the future , of course it may not but the data shows a  strong trend. 

As a data scientist to put your feelings and comfort with how the world currently works above data that is very clear and in front if you is a bold choice to make.

Also! For any of you early adapters that want to buy items privately using crypto or other means check out anonshop : https://anonshop.app/

Anon shop lets you use Monero to buy anything that you can buy on the internet but you buy it anonymously even the site doesn't store your data as it uses zero knowledge proof to get the order shipped to you or an amazon locker near you. 

You can buy things as small as computer parts, fun gifts or even gold bars (and you dont have to be doing financial crimes or selling drugs). This sounds like an ad but i actually just think the service is really cool ive seen their development over the years and it shows one of the clear use cases for crypto.

"You probably do not need a fully correct dataset.

First thing I would do is see how these images fare with a simple classifier. Think single-layer CNN or stuff like that. That is your baseline. If you can't get that baseline up with a more complex network given enough time, then yeah, it's the dataset. But you should be able to do so, because a bigger network is not only able to learn more rules based on your data, it's also able to denoise your data more.

So personally, after a single-layer CNN, I'd go towards Resnet-18, then Convnext, and then maybe some small vision transformer. After each iteration you'll get a new baseline. If at some point you have no gains no matter how well you train the model, you know that's the limit of your dataset. After that, you dig into it.

The first thing you have to do when cleaning a dataset up is a good, gold label set. You'll have to go in yourself or hire an expert you trust to get that. After that it's just training on that, then picking outliers from the remainder set, and trying to label those. At some point, you'll be surpassing the performance of your model. I would personally stop once I cut the error rate to 1/5th of the original dataset - this is just my rule of the thumb. So, if you currently have 50% error rate, then you do this until you reach 10% error rate. If you have 20%, you go until 96%, etc. After that point, it would probably be not feasible to continue.

"So let's think about this Certificate of Authenticity thing. Let's also keep in mind that we have PGP so a CoA could have a QR code that holds a piece of data that can be verified using the manufacturer's public key. The manufacturer is responsible for assuring us it is theirs and can revoke it.

As soon as you have some sort of CoA that a consumer can see, it can be copied. You have a physical good, how do you know that that CoA goes with that exact item?

Even if the CoA has some sort of item identifier on it and the physical good has that identifier stamped on it, what would it take for a knock-off to fake this? A photocopier and a stamp.

I have always loved statistics and being able to interpret data. While I don't have a strong background in coding, I have been able to do well in my courses so far. I am just wondering though if pursuing another master's would be worth my time, or if I am choosing the wrong field.

"Think of it like the dotcom bubble. Everyone knew the internet had promise, but no one knew what to do with it yet. And it was going to take time for adequate infrastructure to build up around it, enabling cloud computing and Web 2.0.  

Right now, blockchain, crypto, etc. is in a similar place. There remains a lot of long-term promise, but it’s very compute-intensive, too slow for many practical use-cases at scale, and too complicated for everyday users. It will take time for niche communities that can truly benefit from the current state to develop and mature the technology. As compute hardware becomes more energy efficient and developers start figuring out the right way to apply it, it will gain more adoption.

I wouldn't go for DS degree, the only online master degree that can help is Georgia Tech but I'd go for computer science, not Analytics. Doing computer science opens more doors. Georgia Tech is also affordable compared to others.

Option 3, in person master is a good option, for maybe a statistics masters or computer science, but it's extremely expensive unless there is a good one that's affordable close to you. 

I think that an online masters part-time and her doing internship (or even unpaid volunteering internship) during the summers (since she'll have them ""off"") could be a good option.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaQVd5SmprOVFQLU9COFpBSFNEMURxLW5PamhYeDRDOWhLd2lzcXkzamZXbnRfamVFeUJlcktJR3FPRTgwMmk5MHd6NnZ3YjMxOTVEd3VTUWlvMkpiRVZEWW1vUEpXNHkzTjV3SGdyTk5LZG89
"I’m a Colombian Data Scientist, I have 3 years of experience without counting internships. I’m looking for my next role, the experiences I’ve had are:

	•	I started out as an intern on a quant team at a pension fund.

	•	Then I moved to Data Science at a major ratailer in my country. Did all sorts DS and DA. (junior)

	•	I got 1 year contract to work as an ML engineer on a computer vision project. 

	•	Currently I work as a Semi Senior Business Analyst looking at the electricity market 


The long term goal that I have is to be a lead in Data team, hence the variety in the roles; I want to have practical knowledge on each aspect of a team/each team of a department. In that order of thought, the next thing to do is Data Engineering. I know some ETL and cloud stuff (mostly vertev AI, BigQuery and Storage), but I probably need to know more things like dockers, and other things I’m not aware of  before I can get DE role hahaha
 

I thing is that want to change sooner rather than later, I got into this job mostly because the difference in pay between a US company and my previous Colombian employers was to big to ignore. I’m willing to get another BA/DA/DS role while I get good at DE.
 
I have three questions:
 

1) What are the things I should learn given my background?

2)Is there a chance I can get a DE role rn without loosing the income level I’m on? (currently 25.5k USD per year, which in a developing country is a lot compared to the 20k tops I could make working with local companies if I get a role as a senior)

3)How can I get offers from American companies? what are the websites, events, networking things I should use? I got my current position from talking to a friend who got reached out to but didn’t speak good english, so he sent the recruiter to me. XD
 

Any help on either of the 3 questions is very appreciated",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVENnTDFweWNXQ290djEtaGkyU3dONTExYktmanJDeUJ3ajh0YWtQSGVFbkJSR2RsbEtVdXVGZmp6ZGJxOS1EUkwzandnaUcwc0JGa1MyQ0R1eXFjVnc9PQ==

"An idea i had. Combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with blockchain technology enables a secure, decentralized, and collaborative approach to model training and knowledge sharing. Each participant trains their local LLM on private data, ensuring data privacy, and then encrypts and stores the updated model weights on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and verifiable. A decentralized aggregation process retrieves these weights, aggregates them using federated learning techniques, and forms a global model that reflects the combined knowledge of all participants. This global model is then redistributed to all nodes for further local fine-tuning, continuously improving through iterative cycles. This method leverages blockchain’s security and transparency, ensuring trust and integrity in the collaborative learning process.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVUVjOVdjRjNYOHFyYlpxMHBZV0luY1JHTDJTWHNvWGZsdU80Y2o0WHg2bVJuYjRMUEZzcDhybnByMV9EdmhVQXpicGR3VW92LTBoWWptMk9NQVFOUkE9PQ==

"That's also a bad idea for the same reason that a gold ETF is not a good form of money.

Assets with a fixed supply lack the stability of value. 

Inflation is not that bad of a phenomenon for money. As long as VAR(delta(price)) is low. 

If the variance in the price is high, you can't easily make contracts or loans with a volatile money. Because you need to denominate the contract in something over a period of multiple years.

Writing, say, a  gold-denominated 7 year loan would have a really unappealing interest rate because the underwriter would have to price in a couple of standard deviations of possible price movement.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNacUU3QU9BWktwcjJ0Q3h5RlB2WjRqZjFmTFZINm9aUHRzVE8wVWVNeXlOZ0d0c0xLM2NZNWlwOHJMbWY3SU5XR1FmODFBdjF1UWtpSzdJeUdtQTJBZmc9PQ==

"This actually doesn't matter all that much. In order for someone to sell you a fake bag, they have to have a real certificate of authenticity on the blockchain and be willing to transfer it to you. That means they had to have a real bag at some point and then switched it out for a fake one. The lack of the certificate would completely destroy the resale value of the real bag, so they'd only be able to pull this scam once. That's decent enough protection from the type of scam where someone will sell you a real certificate and a fake bag.

Then as a second line of defence, the thing that ties it to the specific bag doesn't have to be very complicated. The thing you're trying to do is not fall for fakes that are mass-produced, not completely stop anyone from being able to make a fake that matches a certificate. So long as it's painstaking and time-consuming people won't bother, because it can only be used as a one-off. Once they sell you the certificate they can no longer pull this scam any more. Something as simple as a stitching pattern that encodes a sequence that's in the certificate would probably do it.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTdoeGZPdEhZWHI1VFF3c0dnRWYwY3FaQWtRd1g0SndZS2tqY3pleEdqWmZvQ0ZfencxYWREXzdzWmd4RWFYclpWWUYzdTEzMTB1QUU1RXRlVzdlamc9PQ==
"They can't copy the CoA because it's only valid if it has a chain of custody back to being minted by Gucci on the blockchain. That's like the only feature the blockchain has that's worth a damn. They could upload the same data again, but you can validate that it's source isn't Gucci and you know it's a fake certificate.

The certificate doesn't necessarily need to match up with one exact bag, though it would certainly help. In the scenario we're imagining, a lot of the value of a bag is tied up in its certificate. Someone would have had to have a real bag with a real certificate and then sell a fake bag with the real certificate. This would destroy the resale value of the real bag, as they no longer have the certificate, so they can't repeat this scam. They do get to keep a nice bag I guess.

The real scenario that this protects you from is someone making 10,000 fakes and passing them off as real, not someone painstakingly making a copy of this exact bag. The thing that ties the bag to the certificate doesn't have to be incredibly complicated for this to be good enough, say something encoded in a stitching pattern.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNadDFLN2FCRG9PREdrZXF4NUI4bTdtcExRX3lnYXZmUjQzbURUV1hUaTdWOFBfSzdiRFA4b2xiYnpQdmRzR18ycU9OUm9NYVFLNW44alFuekZkYVNvcHc9PQ==

Right now I’m currently considering of pursuing of becoming a data scientist in the medical field or in healthcare. I don’t have that much professional experience aside from tutoring statistics and having a BS in mathematics and minors in computer science and data science.

I have all the requirements to be a data scientist in this hospital except having at least two years of healthcare or lab experience. I’m also considering to become a math teacher and get my credentials and maybe pursue higher education while waiting for a data science job but I’m afraid that it might be too cost effective and not beneficial.

"Hello guys. I'm in dare need of help. I'm currently working on a workload optimization project for my msc final dissertation. I'm tasked to determine the appropriate number of staff a company will need daily based on the amount of load coming in and leaving the company. So, the company is a logistics company that has inbound and outbound sections. The inbound is made up of items coming into the warehouse, and outbound is made of leaving the warehouse. Each of these sections has people working there.

For the dataset, I have 3 important datasets:
1. The inbound dataset: This has a record of all the items coming into the company, the time they came into, the number of pallets in the truck, etc.
2. Outbound dataset: This contains all the records of the loads leaving the company.
3. Workers schedule dataset: This, for me, has been my major concern as it contains a record of how each worker works daily, such as start time and end time, number of hours worked. But my major concern is that it doesn't tell the department the workers worked (inbound or outbound).

Please, I really need help with the problem, I'm struggling with the thought process, and my submission date is drawing pretty close. I'm willing to share more insight into the problem and how I'm struggling. I can't wrap my head around the right thought process. 

Thanks.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabDR0SEYxTllKcFE4UTBuRzZoWU9xT3JGSkJzdWFoREVtc0hudGZxYVJzWU1MX1pJTm84cUh3LXhiYU9sQThzNWRXc2Y3T1ktT0t4bDV2dzFlc2N0bW5UcGREVWkwb2g3REZMQ0xRd0dZU2M9

"Hi! I'm the exactly opposite of yours. I'm in the medical/hospital field for +-10 years and now I finished my data science course and have some certifications... What I can tell to you is, the hospital field have a little limited space in DA or DS because there is a lot of assistance jobs. You can do a big job with dashboards or predictions, but in general their don't care, I think they don't know the real value of the data analysis, the time and the money saved for the hospital...

Maybe in the big pharmaceuticals company's the game is different, because there they give a real value in our jobs of analysis and the impact of predictions or anything like that in the medications can have a huge difference in the results...

So, in summary, its look similar, but it really depends of what area of medical or Healthcare you will be.

"That's the hardest thing to balance in a project like that.

Great product is built through rapid iteration, changing as you learn as quickly as possible. Great software is built in the exact opposite way, by building a very clear abstraction with consistent contracts and complete consistency, no backwards incompatibility, tons of docs and example perfectly up to date. 

Those are fundamentally irreconcilable unless you are an oracle, know exactly where the use cases are going, have nothing to learn. IMO it's why frequently the second mover wins in software, not the first mover.

"IMO you don’t need to really stay up to date too much to do a job, a lot of places have older and more stable systems anyway. 

Sure it’s fun and there are certainly places looking for the newest and greatest thing but most places just want something that works, they want to use the same metrics they’ve used forever, the same systems they’ve used forever.

Basically I want to study AI and become an AI engineer, but I'm also really interested in becoming a data analyst. I have two options in front of me. 
1 - persuing a bachelor in AI & robotics at a globally recognised University 
2 - or persuing a bachelor in AI & Data science, which is the perfect program for me, except the university is less reputable.

Given your knowledge and  background that led you to becoming a data analyst. Would studying an AI program be good enough to do Data analysis as well?

"I think everyone goes this direction. Models don't live long. I had built two fantastic models for a company, then left, and learned that my replacement tore down both my models as soon as they had something to put into production. Totally political. Whereas no one destroys a pipeline just to build their own. 

Even when you're at a company for 10+ years your models will evolve. The business teams will change their strategy, the business will change who they target or their risk tolerance or their decision structure.

"I'm thinking of transitioning out of data science, at least from the private sector. I expect to be on the job market soon due to downsizing. I have 15 years in analytics, the last 5 as a data analyst with a data scientist title, writing queries and building BI dashboards. I have not put a model into production in 2 years because it has not been asked of our team, but I have helped three consulting firms understand our data so they can build models for us. 

I think I haven't worked at a company that understands how to use models to generate value. My most common request is to deliver a spreadsheet so a product owner can look at it and find insights. It pays well but I don't expect to find another job like this because I don't have experience that matches my title. 

Is it worth it to train up in Gen AI and try to find another private sector data science job? Should I be looking in the public sector, where the work might be less political and more about problem-solving than justifying some project's continued existence?

"I have a masters degree in economics and have taken graduate-level statistics courses. In an enterprise environment, data science methods are often treated as black box where your understanding of math is less important than your ability to solve problems. The mathematics have more to do with knowing the impact of excluding observations from your training or test set, or looking for balance or imbalance in those sets. Yes, at one point you needed to know matrix algebra to implement support vector machines or kahlman filters but that's push-button now, and AutoML systems will just decide which algorithm is best for you.

"So the lab experience is an interesting requirement. Is it a research position where you would need to know experimental design? The difference matters because health care data is its own domain, especially when you talk about treatment, finance (insurance) or public health/epidemiology. Those are all very different problems and very different sets of data. 

I'd still suggest applying for the position at the hospital and leveraging your volunteer role to ask for an informational interview. Get 30 minutes with the hiring manager and ask about gaps in your resume - and then communicate with that manager when you fill in those gaps with a course, a project or even other experience.

Your other choice is working by teaching, which has a complex set of incentives but does NOT pay well. It is easier to go from industry to education rather than vice versa because so much of the education degree focuses on the classroom rather than on building ML systems or supporting analysis. I've looked at the reverse path - leaving industry to go into teaching - and it would be at least 2 more years of school for me, plus unpaid student teaching (a non-starter for me as a midlife person with small kids) and would mean a 50% pay cut.

"I totally agree that you need to follow the money to find the analytical jobs. A hospital will have fewer than the hospital management company. The hospital management company will want to do anything to improve on metrics related to reducing costs, reducing repeat visits (which dings them with regulators), improving insurance collection, improving patient outcomes (which helps them with regulators), and improving retention of staff. I'll also be honest that hospitals continue to shed staff through waves of consolidations and the loss of business to urgent care and outpatient surgical clinics. In another decade, hospitals could be a very lean operation, so I'd suggest aligning with one that is diversifying by going into urgent care and outpatient surgery.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhSWF5bXZzeE5LcEQzN1Z2aERMX2JMSzRaYmpnRjZETVlRaEZtbnhUZTJyR1dIM2E1UjBnekhER2QtUnNZWVRnUEY2U1BQOE84U0t5cC1QcDB6QW1oQ2xxYnBTdFZhRXFETUFLZVR2b3RCNlk9

"I think the problem with ""staying up to date"" with such a broad field as ""data science"" is that there is huge false positive potential. Unless you are on the cutting edge of a really niche area where any news is relevant to your work, you usually are wasting your time by reading things just because they sound ""interesting"". 1% of what you stumble upon might end up being truly useful to you if you're lucky.



My approach is to keep working with the current knowledge I have, but keeping an open mind by constantly reevaluating whether my current approach is appropriate for my goals. Once I've identified some part of my workflow that appears to be a trouble spot (model not accurate enough, training/analysis taking too long, question I'm trying to answer doesn't fit neatly into standard classification/regression task, experiment design not flexible enough, etc), I'll simply spend a while googling that specific topic. Usually after reading a couple blogs or article abstracts/intos I'll have a general idea of the problem space, common techniques used, and hints of what to dig into to investigate further. Then I can just keep going until I find what I'm looking for. With this approach, I keep myself fully engaged because everything I'm reading is relevant to the problem I'm working on (even if I don't end up using a specific technique, having a more complete understanding of the area is great background knowledge), and my false positive rate is very low.


For example, I recently found myself wondering if I could improve my team's experiment analysis approach. We'd been using OLS on switchback data up until that point, which I was starting to think was limiting us because of the difficulty of modeling dependence on nonlinear features. A couple days of googling on the subject led me down a rabbit hole where I discovered new ideas like g-computation, double ML, generalized etimating equations, targeted maximum likelihood estimation, influence functions, propensity scores, etc. Now I've implemented some of this into our analysis pipeline and we are getting tighter error bounds on our inferences, and are more confident in the results. And now I'm the team expert on this kind of thing.


Or the time I realized a project we were treating as a binary classification problem could benefit from understanding time dependence. Some googling there led me to the concept of survival analysis and now several teams use it after I introduced it to them.



So don't waste your time; looking for solutions without a problem to use them on is a giant time sink that will make you go mad.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhcGRkOFdudW5oSXJGLVdqTEp3WmI5eHVGRl9TeC1OVXhLN19xMFpJeTBOcDBBYU9JaElId1BuNERfTjF2Q1lCeHA3dEpQeWpvMGlDYVkzTFlwblJ5Tmc9PQ==

"100% agreed on the Edward Tufte recommendation. I’ve been a fan since I saw my first sparkline decades ago.  

I think I’m trying to ask one step more abstract than where to learn Power BI — taking that as an example, I feel like I only even know these things exist because they get mentioned on this sub with a bit of a “well of course everybody in the industry knows X and uses it daily…” And that’s fair, I’m not a data scientist, there are bound to be things I’m unfamiliar with. So I end up with a lot of “oh ok, I will learn that too” moments. BI suites are just an example - it could be some specific technique for regression or something for estimating probability distributions. Like a comment is “obviously we’d all use data envelopment analysis for that” and I’m on Wikipedia searching DEA.     

I think that’s maybe my difficulty articulating my question — I don’t even know what I don’t know. And so I’m asking more about resources for what to learn rather than how to learn it?  But I realize as soon as I type that that it’s just a setup for “it depends”.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWjhOY0ZZaUl6RmVTTzg1SktjR3doQ21tS3o4LWFOVTF6bjFESDV2RVE1dUVoQWxPRldlWnN4MjlxbzZpcENFT0ZpZjQxRmZqYVYzYWN5ZXlkR0Rlcnc9PQ==

Now that I have joined, it feels that people here are so much smarter. it doesn’t help that my manager is very harsh in feedback and the first task i did for them didn’t go very smoothly. i guess my anxiety stems from the fact that i feel that im overpaid for my skill level. i want to learn more but im lost at where to start.",r/datascience,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna2NpYmpPb2hnQ0Q1VVgyMXo3Y2ZGRmk1NFh5VkxBS3NCeWN0VXM4aUdRa3pWOHdUVm1ITjlFSGs1TjBrNHdiaThocXEyX21pM3RFN0ZCakJMUGI1bEE9PQ==

"The problem with fighting to be up to date is you become a beta tester, spending lots and lots of time figuring things out and dealing with many headaches along the way.  Or you can wait a few years then learn the tech.

What I do is I hear chatter irl and online (this sub is a great source for chatter) and then I keep a mental note if I see a new tech mentioned multiple times.  After around 2-4 years when I have some free time I'll check it out and pick it up.  The exception is when this new tech is perfect for what I need right now and it is a godsend, then I'll learn it immediately.

So e.g. in the last 4 or so years from chatter on this sub I've checked out: VSCode, Polars, Plotnine, and DuckDB.  That's it.  Poetry I might get around to checking out in a couple of years if I'm in the mood.

Back in the day it was CUDA in 2008, Python in 2010, Pandas in 2012, CNN in 2013, Jupyter Notebooks and XGBoost in 2014, Spark in 2015, PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2016, Plotly in 2017, Transformers in 2018 (LLMs), Prophet in 2019, and SQL from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

If you look at it there is a new tech worth checking out every year to every other year.  Each tech take a couple of days to a couple of weeks to learn.  If you're spending 2 weeks out of the year keeping up to date, you're pretty much up to date.
