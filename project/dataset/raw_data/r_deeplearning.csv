Linear regression is only accurate when the interaction between the two variables is linear (a * x1 + b * x2 + c) since linear regression is trying to fit a line (or plane) to the data.

"As for any other field, there’s only one way: read. Read cornerstone papers to get the concepts, then read derived papers to understand more general ideas. Finally, ask yourself questions and try to answer those.

An example: I read the residual network paper (Ho et al. 2016 IIRC). Then, I check relevant related papers that include RNNs. By reading, you eventually acquire the idea that the recurrence extends the temporal horizon of your representation, that is, by using a recurrent network your model can remember things from the past (very very simplified explanation here). 

Finally, you need to decide a model for your own project. You ask yourself “does my model need to remember things from the past?” If the answer is yes, then you know that you have to use a recurrent network. Else, you don’t. Supposing that you need a RNN, the knowledge acquired by now should be enough to let you at least try an implementation from scratch. If it doesn’t, go back to the papers you already read.

"Basically, if you're resourceful you don't NEED to upgrade. If you're learning, most models can be run just fine on 4GB of VRAM. If you want to use larger batch sizes during minibatch gradient descent, you can further subdivide minibatches into subbatches and accumulate gradients as you perform several smaller forward passes (just to address the possibility of anyone complaining about being limited to small batch sizes). If this still isn't enough you can pay for cloud GPU which is very cheap compared to a new PC.

If you'd prefer to own your own hardware, imo the minimum hardware that would warrant buying would probably be a 3090 for that sweet 24GB VRAM, a decent CPU with 32GB+ RAM.

Personally don't recommend someone directly dive into doing ML projects. Without mathematical foundation all you learn is importing libraries and knowing basic data preprocessing.

"I'm new to the visual side so this is just a guess.  

Your model expects the input to be of a particular dimension.  If it isn't it will resize it as necessary but is winding up with blocky pixels.  An SR of blocky pixels is also blocky.

When you upsample, the dimensions match and no upsizing is needed.  The SR works as expected.

"I believe you’re entangling the concept of input size and upsampling with a particular interpolant in terms of its effect on pixels in the input image as a pre processing operation.

If your model is trained on images that have been upsampled with a bicubic interpolant, that affects the smoothness of the pixels in the output upsampled image as they are averaged weighed by the interpolant. The filters in your convnet have been trained to expect similarly preprocessed content, regardless of input grid size.

As an experiment, take your upsampled images and then crop a portion of them and perform inference with your trained CNN.

Depends on why you are applying the transformations. If you’re applying them to prevent overfitting and you already have a sufficiently large dataset then I wouldn’t add them. If you doing this because your dataset is too small or you have a data imbalance in your dataset then I would just add them (probably keep them in a separate directory in case you want to remove them)

Transformations should be random, if you just apply the same transformation to every image it defeats the purpose of applying transformations (to create more varied data)

"Again, just guessing, but..

If you look into the guts of the CNN model definition, you'll see that each layer is more than likely some combination of the following:

""Conv2d"" takes any size, but the output size changes.

""MaxPool2d"" takes any size but its output also changes appropriately

Conv2d and MaxPool2d are algorithmic and only have fixed parameters.

--

""Linear"" is for a fully connected layer and is a 'fixed' input and a 'fixed' output size.  

Linear is where your model weights go.  This is why the sizes for your Linear layer are fixed to whatever the model was trained with.   


I believe that if the image size is unbounded, your 'forward' function will fail since the conv/pool final output wont match the first fully connected layer input.

If you can infer with any sized image, then Something Somewhere is adjusting the image size.

"The key difference between conv2d and conv3d layers in DL lies in their dimensionality and what kind of data they are designed for:

* Conv2d: This layer is suited for two-dimensional data, typically images. It performs convolutions with a 2D kernel that slides across the width and height of the image, extracting spatial features. 

* Conv3d: This layer is built for three-dimensional data, often videos. It uses a 3D kernel that moves across the width, height, and depth (time dimension) of the video. The kernel can capture features that consider not just spatial information within a frame but also how those features change across frames. Conv3d is commonly used in video analysis tasks like action recognition or 3D object detection.

In your case you have a flat feature vector so a `conv2d` is what you want.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUdTNlRnAzYnl0ZWpYYTBVZFVrOEdsd2xLZzdvWmQwTzZTM2NpMlFUalRRaUhaRHpTcm82dDZoTFlSRGdMcGt5VnJPYzhKZEZFVy03ZkJPZjdjUkR3SHVxRWlmeU41MzRySm9Pa3VQTXhIVzg9

"The choice is up to you when you design your network.

I'm aware of two ways of handling it:

* 3D Volume: A video can be represented as a 3D volume where:

  - Width and height correspond to the spatial dimensions of a single frame.
  - Depth represents the number of frames (or channels depending on the data format).

* Convolution Operation:

 - The conv3d layer applies a filter (kernel) across all three dimensions.

"> CF happens when a model forgets its previous capabilities when training on a new task.

That is correct.

The main issues I've run into are related to:

* Transfer learning: If tasks share some similarities, a model that forgets can't leverage its prior knowledge for the new task. This makes learning from scratch necessary which can be costly.

* Real-world robustness: Real-world data often has variations within a single task category. A model forgetting everything for slight variations wouldn't be robust.

In essence, catastrophic forgetting can prevent your model from being useful even when the domain is highly specific.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcy1pYWN0ZS1TMmNqU3poM2E1N3lCN1Q0cTFIM2wxUnRvQzVRWVp1SEZYS2ktMzdDMFJ6SEpHOWUteHVqRlRHMHRUblk2MHhxanEyazBEd1hxQzBwT3B6Wlp3cXlybDR3U1MyMWVqdk9rM2M9

"You bring up two important points here.

1. Shifting-up can cause clipping if we shift the gradients up too much. That's why in practice we can also dynamically find the loss scale factor that doesn't cause such overflows (e.g. multiplying the max gradient by the scale and seeing if it overflows in FP16 -> https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html#scalefactor)
2. While I don't have a complete answer here, part of the reasons are the softmax function, and backpropagation. Remember the gradients are the partial derivatives with respect to the loss. And the loss we use is the cross entropy loss, that involves softmaxing the given logits.

When we start calculating the weight gradients, we first start the backpropagation chain by calculating dlogits, then dW2, etc. Notice how dlogits, because we softmax it, is always a pretty small negative number. We multiply this number with the rest of the gradients because of backpropagation and thus our weight gradients are bound to be pretty small too.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRWt4V2xBenh5aUFhdThxTnlNMFMxLXZPVVJPZjVtazE2YlRlczZIeExiNTZnM1d0bWtCNkM1WlZYbVZtMFdnVWxEeDZOLWNRa2oyY0wyMWZRZXRfOHc9PQ==

"Yes, it definitely makes sense.

Language models learn a latent space where similar texts are mapped close together (I always think of this concept in terms of Eigenvectors). This space implicitly captures semantic relationships between words and concepts in your dataset. In high dimensions, data often resides on lower-dimensional structures (i.e. a manifold). By approximating the manifold *within the latent space*, you're essentially uncovering the underlying organization of your text data.

You've probably already figured out that manifolds tend to be much easier to analyze and visualize compared to the full, high-dimensional latent space.

"Keras leverages TensorFlow's 
`tf.distribute` strategy API to enable distributed training even for sequential models. This API abstracts the distribution logic, allowing you to train on multiple devices (GPUs, TPUs) or machines with minimal code changes to your Keras model.

A common approach for distributed training with Keras is data parallelism. Here, the model weights are replicated across all devices, and each device processes a different portion of the training data in parallel. This speeds up training by utilizing the combined computational power of the distributed system.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWNGtlSUFqRldzZmQtQXI0d29uSVBhXy1lT0xIc2ZDaEp6UWJlMGtzYXpNLUdRbXdFaWFrMEdpaGZtWDVWMUp2SFVPOUZueGdKYUlSaUkzUmdfTXFaa2c9PQ==

"You can find a detailed specification comparison of the 4000 series cards [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/compare/). Pay particular attention to the ""tensor cores"" and ""memory interface width"" rows.

Any of these cards can handle training and inference for just about any model as long as it can fit in RAM. You can even run LLMs on these cards if you use a quantized version of the model.

In practice, you can use anything in this series. Your main concern will be the amount of RAM which will limit your batch size while training.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWTU5STlFuM0pvREN4LXd5T2xGRkd1LU9HbWhVcEJGSGNVa3ZHOUE4cVcwU1dWcXB0emlRWnpwMkdSbklfUUxta3BRajlSdUZqUDBzSzNObnI1blFWWnc9PQ==
"In short, doesn’t matter how fast your GPU is if you can’t fit the model on it (for example, say the next gen 5000 series from Nvidia have a boost in performance so much so an RTX 5060 is 300$ and twice faster than RTX 3090 (which you can get used for like 700$) 

if it still has 8/12 GB VRAM you can’t fit the models on it so basically it’s like a supercar that has a really small gas tank so it can go really fast to… nowhere

for DL you have to see how much VRAM you’ll need (based on your needs/models used) and then make a decision from there). For big models it is often better to get dual 3090’s (sometimes only choice if you don’t have money to buy dual 4090’s) because that will give you 48 GB VRAM whereas an RTX 4080 has only 16 GB VRAM",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWaTc5aEFtYlY3eks3VENSZGVIakNsR0VmUGthWjRHOVZNaDVBbTBxY1VZNFpaSUdIRU1JT2MxaWZEdTIwT3dLTzJCQTdmRThtSkp2c25IWmFfV2pDVmp6TFl4QlozajhQeFVUazlwbDFKMGs9

Which is why my desktop GTX 1080 desktop can match/seldom outperform a 3070 laptop in model training.

If you need mobility, then go for an Intel/Nvidia laptop. Most gaming laptops will do, but may be heavier or have loud fans. I have a Razer Blade 4K OLED which almost has the build quality of a Macbook Pro but with gaming capabilities and quality components inside. It is what the Macbook would be if Apple hadn't dumped Intel and Nvidia.

For Deep Learning, any Mac (even M series) should be your last choice, unless you plan to use Colab or cloud computing for your GPU needs. In my deep learning class, even folks who used paid Colab subscription and cloud computing struggled to train models as their models would train for hours and time-out. My desktop would reliably finish the same training in 20-60 mins using a 1080 GPU.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiQlhzQ0plS1RtWXhBRHNhUXF1S3JwX2twY2V0bHNTeGl3S2U1MUtpNy1KVV9adUNVSUl0eGctOUhlTXRIUWl6QV96ckdHMjVjZjJQZjM1X1lMc1dCV0E9PQ==

"One of the biggest issues with DQN is Q-value overestimation and a target network that is updated less frequently helps mitigate this, improving training stability.

You could gather learning experiences by performing actions until the episode is done and only use the rewards obtained directly from interacting with the environment (monte carlo reward), to determine V(s+1) for the equation Q(s, a) = reward + gamma * V(s+1), but this approach is giving you a highly biased estimate of the actual value of that state because you only observe one sequence of actions and the corresponding rewards from state (s+1) to the end of the episode. There are many possible actions and outcomes from (s+1) that are not considered, which leads to both high variance and bias in estimating the true value of V(s+1) with the approach I think you're suggesting.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjbTNrdVN2NVZfRlB5VHJqNEdQc19zaFgzNmtfVlIyV2c2aWVzYmVQOUhWd2hnejJxYWZESnFGRnRjdmJRbGRYME1rSzZNZnYyUjBDd0JvUDJlRHF0NGY2eDZQUGdCUUVjNUd6R2RBVWVOZ3c9

"I worked with a lot of real estate data doing auto evaluation models and because most data are input by realtors (real world data use cases in my cases), a lot of the data was garbage, input by text area inputs (front end), versus drop down choices (limited). This created a lot of errors, a lot of columns with high cardinality and a lot of outliers (most prolly human error ). Without proper front end and back data validation techniques, the data integrity was abysmal. There was a lot of imputation needed. Secondly I had created a lot of udfs to impute missing data or bad data with data from another column. For example say lot area was missing or wrong, I would group by area and take a mean or median if huge amount of outliers.

"Regularization (e.g. L1, L2, dropout, etc.) constrains the parameter space, making it less prone to overfitting by preventing the model from becoming too complex. This constraint can make the optimization process more efficient in some cases, as it prevents the model from exploring overly complex solutions that may not generalize well.

However, the statement you're referring to is specific to the phenomenon observed during [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping), where parameters corresponding to directions of *significant curvature* tend to learn early relative to parameters corresponding to directions of less curvature. This statement is more about the dynamics of optimization rather than the effect of regularization per se.

In the context of early stopping, the parameters that correspond to directions of significant curvature (i.e., where the loss function changes more rapidly) are likely to learn quicker, regardless of regularization, because updates in those directions lead to more significant changes in the loss function. Regularization might influence the *magnitude* of these changes but doesn't fundamentally alter the curvature.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjOENTLWkzQk95T1ZQVWFkSGppVjNEOThYaVdIakRsRTRrYzg2b0VHSENmeWQyZFg1dUtYUnVaUWFQZzRsWFFMcTAxazY2aVpMNkhOaERfR0FXQndWMWc9PQ==

"i agree, and feel that is what goodfellow is getting at. but I think there is a hidden assumption that the learning rate is small enough for that direction.

  
to OP.  the classic visualisation is a long narrow, sloping valley - in one direction of high curvature, the minimum is very close, in the direction along the sloping valley the minimum is far away ( low curvature means that it takes a long distance for the gradient to change to (in particular to reach zero = minimum)

considering now gradient descent, whether you learn early or actually jump from one mountain ridge to the other (ie overshoot/oscillate) depends on how big your learning rate is relative to the curvature.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjclhhZjUxVFNHV0tuSmdPMWMxOGRZaWYtLXdSYWpXODM0VWtRSTV4djZkclcxTWRhRVdTRkhEODlsVkwzQlg1QWhaQl9lNUZhOXc2ZlBVX1JQTTRxRkE9PQ==
"I would suggest this: First obviosly 'price' is the label, so you don't use that feature as an input (feature(s) = column(s)), other wise you will bleed info into model and always get a near perfect prediction rate. Use domain knowledge (or common sense what would make the price of a property higher, here you are lucky the feature names are straight forward and not cryptic). I would choose an x amount of features, the ones you think are the most intuitive. (Area, No. bedrooms, car parking (as I know this is becoming a problem in big indian cities) and a few others, dont choose all intuitive features for now. The main objective is just try to get your ml pipeline going and spitting out some result without overthinking it. Then tweak it with all intuitive features. Im assuming price is a continuous variable, so you would use some sort of regressor algo. Now instead of relying on corr matrix, there is some algos that offer feature importance.

yes I think you are right, screenshots + maybe some scrapping (web scrapping for web requests maybe)

yes they changed the hardware to run models locally, but from what I heard, the privacy concerns came more from the new 'recall' function they added (which allows to come back to old sessions) this records actions that are done on the computer and saves them (so that recall can work) + the copilot knowing what's on the screen and being able to execute some things (especially if it's connected online) this is just from what I heard",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjXzVrRUdzN0dTb0R5S1pjblpDckhzOHBhWTBVRlVQaURNanp4cnAwSFI1aGthQ1lueHdVWXl2VUJZcDZFS2VVUk4ya1hidVR6MnJRTmNpMlVsa2dFc1E9PQ==

"I think there are two options to consider here. On one hand, you’re right in that if your model is only trained on 5 classes, it can only show the probability across those five classes. However, you might find when the new class is presented that there is no “clear winner”. Usually because cross entropy is trying to produce probabilities as close to 1 as possible, you end up with a probability distribution over the 5 classes that has low entropy (e.g., one clear peak and low scores for the losing classes). When the model isn’t “sure”, sometimes you just get the entropy spread across the classes and the winner is less clear. That is one way I’ve found in the past to extrude confidence from the model, though it’s hacky and not a universal behavior. 

The better answer is likely to explore a zero shot approach. Zero shot object detection has made tremendous strides. Look at Grounding Dino or GLIP. They work like CLIP where they contrast natural language with image embeddings but in this case to localize “the thing(s) In the language phrase”.

"Gigabyte Rtx 4090 Oc 24 gb.
La misma funcionó perfectamente hasta el mes de mayo de 2024. 
Me encontraba usando mi pc y de repente siento un olor a quemado.
Al apagar la pc veo que el conector estaba derretido.
Por tal motivo tuve que acudir a la Garantía de Gigabyte. Teniendo una respuesta negativa de reparar mi GPU, considerando que se debía a un daño físico (sin haber chequeado o revisado mi Gpu).
El soporte de Gigabyte se basa en que Nvidia culpa a los usuarios de conectar mal el conector de corriente y con eso se amparan para no arreglar las gráficas. Aparte si yo la mandaba a RMA de México o Estados Unidos, que son los lugares más cercanos, me cobrarían la reparación. Lo que considero que es una falta toral de responsabilidad, ya que el conector estaba perfectamente conectado.

"ROTFL --- are you a time-traveler from 2016, or a clever troll.

In case you really are that far out of the loop....

Tensorflow has been falling out of favor for many years: https://paperswithcode.com/trends

In my opinion: 

* Tensorflow 1 was OK for its time but inflexible and hard to use for anything different than the out-of-the-box tutorials - which is why wrappers around it like Keras gained popularity.
* Tensorflow 2 tried being more pytorch-like, but pytorch was already there, leaving Tensorflow 2 an awkward and clumsy mix of both.
* Google (the original Tensorflow guys) also got frustrated with TF, and created Jax, largely replacing it internally.
* Keras saw the declining interest in Tensorflow so added PyTorch support; so even Keras users don't need to be stuck with TensorFlow anymore.

There's only one single area where I still find tensorflow better than pytorch -- tensorflow.js (tensorflow in the browser). Sure, pytorch can export to onnxruntimes targeting webgl, but I find them harder to use.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkSmlxMHdvZzRUWXcwcFJObEJnaGFoZng5WjF2aUxYTlc2M05WaDBHSS1RQVZwUHNqY1JnUm43Tl9QaHdpWDRaZVVQMXpZM256c3NNWWVYX1cya0xoY0kyQzFmSjZ3a3lWcUlmb184bjB3MXc9

"Hey! Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are great for deep learning and computer vision.

* **PyTorch** is often preferred for research and quick experimentation because it's more Pythonic and flexible.

"For tabular data, would highly recommend 'classical machine learning' methods, and familiarising yourself with those if you haven't already. These methods include linear and logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs, K-neighbours, random forests, boosting models etc. These methods are more simple, interpretable and less likely to overfit than deep learning models. Not only this, but they generally perform better on tabular data too.

"This can absolutely be a pure linear model. Yes, the OP is asking about Deep Learning approaches, but the point that was being made here is that the OP really needs to learn *modeling* in general in addition to deep learning. I would guess from the post that the OP has a life sciences background and not a background in math/statistics/CS/engineering. The point of modeling is to generate the best model. What is the best model? The one with minimal error on a test set? The most interpretable model? It depends on the problem. It does not answer the OP's question but this was still a point that needs to be made.

"To respond to this and the deleted comment:

- Did you even read OP's question (very polite)

Yes, but admittedly didn't read as carefully as I could have. Also think your proposed solution is sensible and should work, but still don't think deep learning is necessarily required and could quite easily end up overfitting (especially on smaller datasets), and will further be much harder to interpret than simpler models. There are going to be trade offs — one approach isn't unilaterally better than the other. 

- Suggestion to learn modelling with simpler ML algorithms

Would you not agree that it is a more sensible progression to first become more adept in data science, modelling and simpler non-neural network-based machine learning before moving onto deep learning? Not doing so will likely result in over-engineered solutions and a weaker understandings of ML fundamentals.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTDYwZl9DLXFqbzVfZVc4aUhnbEp5OER5bURYakpMWTktbFgwaW5rdEs4NnIwYklYNjcxdE9OT3o3WnlJT21mYlAyVl9GUHREX2hTQ2UxZU9seXpPczJJT01jSHhKWjlUdHVucnY2VlJHdzQ9

"Thanks! I appreciate the recommendation to start with classical machine learning methods for my tabular dataset.

However, I should mention that I have a large dataset with over 200 variables and more than 1000 cases. Given the complexity and size of my data, I believe that deep learning models, such as RNNs or LSTMs for the time-series components combined with dense layers for static variables, might provide better performance. Additionally, I aim to identify potential risk factors that are not yet known, which might be better captured by more complex models.

Would you still recommend starting with classical methods in this scenario, or should I dive into deep learning models directly?",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlazJLRFViYnQ4QWl3Mm5XN1VxMXdEdUR0TldSQzRNWlA5MVpzV3FHc0l5Tk1YQXk0TWJYVjRubThHSEtEUzVveWItQkN5ZkRpMXdZaERDTXd1WHRnM2FFU2RudG42RU1QallkTHpDaXBjRU09
"You are right! To give some context, I am a medical doctor with a large dataset. And my goal is to predict complications and identify potential unknown risk factors. I just started my PhD, but im familiar with the basic statistic methods. 

I believe that due to the complexity of the data and my goal, deep learning might be more suitable, but please correct me if I'm wrong! You raise valid points, and I hope that by providing my context, the nature of the problem becomes clearer. It needs to be interpretable, but also as accurate as possible since it's a medical issue.

The challenge I face is understanding how to process different types of variables (static and continuous). For example, consider a blood value that increases over time, for which a threshold is currently used in the clinic to determine if a complication is present. I want to create a dynamic prediction model using deep learning to see if there is an interplay with this threshold, allowing us to confidently predict or even foresee complications earlier.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlOTBMbWZtS1V2VVFzWWYtSGp6UXNNc3MxZEZMaEt4M0lZRnZNM3FGRHAzNVZ1ZjZ3UWdOTGFSeFlfSG1Yd01kVkU4blpINzlSQmdfMjdydUhnS21wbzMzWDAta0JCREJTaElTV1BUcnVuTGM9

"Hi,

Thanks for the extra clarification, a few further questions:

- How many data samples do you have? I.e. How many time series sequences and static variable sets do you have? Deep learning systems are much more data hungry than the conventional ML methods I alluded to. If I'm not misunderstanding and 1000 cases is 1000 samples in total, this is likely not going to be enough data to train deep learning models on. 

- How long are sequences and do you think it's important that a model is able to 'remember' parts of the sequence that occurred a very long time ago, or is the salient information most likely to be that which most recently happened?

- How important is explainability? Deep learning methods can perform well, but are harder to interpret than simpler methods. A complex model may be able to model more complex risk factors, but being able to identify what those risk factors from a trained DL model could be challenging.

With more than 200 variables you'll likely be interested in feature selection, which is another topic covered in the book I suggested. Would still suggest working on some classical machine learning projects, there are loads of open source medical datasets available online to practise with (Kaggle has lots). A non-deep learning time series model worth looking at is ARIMA, which could be used in conjunction with another model for making predictions.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlYXAtZDJkSTJObzV4MWE4TVNRVUtmSUNHbnVuaWxZZDdDMzdwbnAwbzIzTzhLMmtZeGQwTUJWenFVYVEwdExPRWRnbkw1eTliWnBLSWFzMnNFT0swX1FyQ29ybEZBUzJ6WEhnLXI4U3h2NzA9

"> 1) There are some errors in the transcript. Any techniques to improve their accuracy?

One of the easiest things to do is data preprocessing: noise reduction, loudness normalization, and/or segmentation. wav2vec2's accuracy degrades the longer the audio segment so breaking it into smaller chunks can increase overall accuracy.

Personally, I've had great results using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) if you aren't married to wav2vec2. You can pass `--output_format srt` directly to the model via a command-line option. Whisper will now generate an [srt file](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/srt-file) directly.

If you go the Whisper route make sure you select an [appropriately-sized model](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages). I've used both `small` and `medium` with great results.

> 2) I want to time align the transcript with the audio.

"1. You can try OpenAI's Whisper models, available via API and open source (I'd usually use Hugging Face `transformers` for the open source option
2. ^ the above option will give you audio transcripts
3. You can use the [semantic chunkers](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-chunkers/blob/main/docs/00-chunkers-intro.ipynb) library with the text transcriptions.

just focus on the first three courses and Python. With no experience in linear algebra I don't think you can understand much about advanced robotics. Control theory is so math heavy. With 0 python background RL is also the most challenging domain in ML. You need to know how to implement your 'gym' (agent and environment). Also RL have quite lots of maths and coding (unless you import base model).,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlWVNYaGdhU2JQd0FGclRfUVF2Umh1LUk0WTJwNU8tQ0Uxejd6alA3dDRWaTdjZ3BQOVFZY0p3cjhTMVA3bVJpQzBuUVFXTUtwZ2lMNDkzMkVrUjd2RHc9PQ==

"Without knowing exactly what you are doing I'd suggest:

* Modify your learning rate or utilize a [learning rate scheduler](https://machinelearningmastery.com/using-learning-rate-schedule-in-pytorch-training/).

* Ensure you're not working with imbalanced classes as this can cause the model to favor the majority class, resulting in poor accuracy.

* Your model could be over fitting. If that is the case you can use regularization techniques, such as dropout, and monitor the validation loss. Use early stopping based on validation performance to prevent over fitting.

You can try to augment your dataset. this would be doing this like adding random noise to windows and generating time shifted (overlapping) samples. If you do this you'll probably want to make sure overlapping segments don't appear on different sides of the test train split.

Your other option is to augment your data with theirs see the ""Data availability"" section at the end of the paper. If your problem is notably different than that described in the paper you could try transfer learning or fine tuning their model.

"I learned AI practicing Ai. There are plenty of ressources available on GitHub or YouTube. 

You can start by re-coding simple architecture and train them for simple tasks (classification tasks).  There are plenty of tutorial of the DL frameworks pages (Pytorch, Jax, TF, Metal, Pytorch-Lightning..)

Obviously, you'll get plenty of errors and you'll have to check around for unknown parts and try to tackle them. That's where reading paper comes.

The more you'll continue, the more you'll do coding and reading in parallel. 

If you don't have GPUs, there's Google colab
If you don't have ideas for projects, there's Kaggle
If you don't have places where to begin, there's GitHub and it's : awesome-xxx repositories (change xxx with a field you'd like to work with).

"Then it's probably fine. Just train for as long as you can, it could be that your dataset is just really noisy and the model needs time to distinguish between noise and useful information.

You could try an speed things up by increasing the learning rate. I personally use up to 1e-4 if the batch size is really big and I have gradient clipping in place. BERT doesn't seem to diverge until 5e-3 or so. So I guess 1e-5 or 5e-4 couldn't hurt to try and speed things up.

This phenomenon used to be called double descent, now people call it grokking. In short, the model first overfits very hard, and then generalizes. Example: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmT2dhU213Yi05bm90eUx5c0FCLWctQm52SjlTU1ZUMlRRa2VpcGY1YS1YUXRnSFhIUWxVV0NRczhLeGJYalFnalZqdXlFaFpqVnpTZlpmRURNNkFBbmc9PQ==

"Why not incorporate the concept of ""other"" from the start? If you know ahead of time that it's possible your detector will receive ""out of class"" inputs, then show it during the training phase what those will look like. You can't just give it noise, you have to give it data that is representative of the domain. So if you're looking at images, you don't just want to insert gaussian noise, because you aren't likely to receive that as an actual input. Instead you want to include images from the real world, or the real world as this application is likely to see it. Train it on images of things that are outside of those 5 classes, and teach it what things that it will potentially be asked to evaluate that are not of those 5 classes looks like. Then when it comes time to inference, it will be able to say, that's not one of the 5 things I know, it's something else, but I don't know what.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmb29tcHdaUXhNTjE1cldaYnEzWFdWX2MwRXp6YnJWMkFlTFExUHo1eURnM3VFODhfalhNRFVycXA3WmZvMHdnTXFNNlhFbmMtam4wMEtfZVh0aUxiaGc9PQ==
"So a generalized model to detect ""unknown"" class labels merged with the actual data. Yea in that case need to get similar looking parts which wont be used in production. 
In future if they introduce these parts it would likely mess up with model .. 
Unknown class and actual class have similar data distribution. Model should work super hard to tell who's who",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmTGRGQlJTQzRYdnM0cjNSUjZhNFJmejcta1E0Q1dBdzhPVHVDMmlDZE1yZ0ltQ0txRHhXTVNycnlfbktlV2FFOWZDTGp0U01UV25LOTE3N1NYRjlPalE9PQ==
"Well by introducing the existence of realistic out of class (or scope) features into the training set, you're helping the model focus more on features that really are dinstictively characteristic for the 5 in scope classes. It's kind of like teaching the model the concept of NaN. You need a way to represent it if you want to be able to respond to it. 

You're always going to end up with mislabeled data, but if it's possible that a model will be presented with an input that is out of scope, then a model that has no concept of out of scope can't do anything but treat it as in scope -- because that's how you've built the model. Once you loosen up the model to understand that it's possible it might some day see things that it shouldn't have to deal with, then it can say, that's outside of my scope, reject. Sometimes it will give you a false negative, particularly as you mention, if they redesign the parts -- in that case you'd have to retrain the model on the new parts anyway.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmZ1o3ODVjcTI3bnVua3RXYVdOZXAxT2ZZUjE4UldMdDZqSjVqMVprcGZ5dHlCaVZmVjI3RnpkMTF3WlFZZGdYSXhOVlo0azRRdE1rbUhZdlIwSXhMQVE9PQ==

"For very simple models it is straightforward. For example, in linear regression with just a constant, your ""model"" consists of a sample mean over the observations, ie b0hat = (1/n) \\* sum\\_i y\\_i. If you want to remove k observations of ""bad"" data, denoted y\\_j\\^\\*, just do b0hat\\^\\* =  bohat - (1/k) \\* sum\\_j y\\_j\\^\\*, and your new ""model"" has removed the bad data.

From memory, this idea generalizes to the multivariate linear regression model (there's a bit more work involved), but one of the things that makes it feasible is that there is an analytical solution for estimating the model (the good old OLS estimator). But for a Transformer architecture, estimation is done by numerical optimization, and of course, the model itself is highly non-linear, and has an autoregressive component. There is probably a method in the theoretical sense that even a Transformer architecture would have a linear model equivalent in a high enough dimensional space, but implementing such a thing in practice is very much not feasible.

"Nah I mean it literally in the mathematical sense for the ""simplest"" possible model. A linear model with just a constant (simplest possible model) can be written y = b0 + u, and the OLS estimator of b0 is just the sample mean b0hat = (1/n)\\*sum\\_i y\\_i. Now let's say you realize that some of your observations are illegal, denote them y\\_j\\^\\*. You can update your ""model"" to a new model bohat\\^\\* = bohat - (1/n) sum\\_j y\\_j\\^\\*. By construction b0hat\\^\\* is just a sample mean over the non-illegal data so you have quite literally removed the illegal data from your model.

Now obviously this is all very trivial when your model is just a sample mean. It is a bit trickier, but doable, when your model is a multivariate linear regression model. For more complex non-linear models, we can call on the fact that these models usually have a linear representation in a higher dimensional space. However, for eg a LLM Transformer, the linear representation would be really, really, really, absurdly high dimensional, not to mention complicated by the fact that the Transformer is estimated by numerical optimization rather than an analytical formula (hence my comment about it being pretty much practically infeasible for this situation even if it is theoretically possible).",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsTHBxLVZveWRZNWJqbTAtcWtWM25STHh4VFNDdzBEc2dFS3doTkwxVmVyOWRkeWxVbUx5aTA1UldNMTBsWnNDZnplNVJ1bW1panduc3o4V2pRSGFTS2c9PQ==

"A transformer usually doesn't concatenate all the word vectors in a sentence into a single vector but always provides a separate vector for each word. What that first figure is probably showing are the different heads of a single word being squashed into a single vector. The multi head attention works by giving each word multiple vector representations. The first vector of a word will only interact with the first vector of each word. The second vector will only interact with the second vector of each word and so on. For each word, these different vectors representing one word need to then be concatenated and squashed into a single vector so that one word is represented by only one vector. This allows the different information gathered by each vector to mix.

However, at no point would a vector of the first word be concatenated with a vector of the second word. The word vectors are always kept separate.

"Moore’s law and performance increases are *definitely* still in swing with GPUs.

This is just senseless. A government lab just sold a supercomputer that was state of the art 6-8 years ago for $400K. The reason is, it is completely useless in today’s world and more effort than it’s worth to maintain.

Distributed computing incurs HUGE performance penalties across all the different data interfaces that have to be built for purpose. 

You don’t need to change your hardware every few years, but building a decade-old system that is obsolete on day 1 is insane.

What is your budget for this? I can guarantee that I can find a non-cluster server for the same cost that will outperform the cluster you intend to build.

This is NOT just a game of adding up the FLOPS of all your components. Compute does not scale like this. 

What is your plan for networking them? MPI over Ethernet?

Your approach might work for a crypto farm, but if you want the cluster to be working jointly on a problem (simulation, machine learning training), then you want to be doing everything possible to avoid a cluster.

"everyone is barely answering the question...I think the confusion lies in either 1) the definition of equivariance wrt. input permutations (positional equivariance), or 2) how the linear layer is being applied.

1. Equivariance in this context means that if we swap the position of two input tokens, the outputs will also be swapped at those positions. Now looking at the transformer block, we see that each token is processed in the same way: token i updates its value in self-attention by looking at the representation of all other tokens, and then we normalize and feed it through the linear layer. This linear layer applies the same transformation upon each token, which means the output of token i from the linear layer is independent of all other tokens. This tells us that when we don't add a positional embedding, the output of token i is positionally equivariant. 
2. Note that each token is processed in the same way by the linear layer: it doesn't matter if the linear layer is a permutation matrix - if so, this would only change the position of the features within a single token. However, all tokens would be transformed in the same way, regardless of their position. So basically there are two positions: the positions of the features within a token, and the position of the token - a vector of multiple features. The linear layer is not positionally equivariant with respect to the features within a token, but because it's applied in the same way to all tokens, it \\*is\\* positionally equivariant wrt the tokens themselves.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtTFktWHZqSE02T3FPMjRMNWxRNGs1STdiamxTMjZQdGdUekRrWXlSem9GVFQtX0FuVDFfcUhNYkRuZHlpUW9zMFVvaVBUTU5WaDNZY3oyTkJlTTNqcXc9PQ==

"An implementation of a GPT-esque LLM primarily using einops and trained over the TinyStories dataset. It incorporates techniques to support efficient inference with a KV Cache and GQA (grouped query attention).

The project started as an exercise, after seeing Andrej Karpathy's excellent tutorial on building GPT2 from scratch and seeing him mention that einops was pretty powerful, I looked at leveraging einops as the core of building the transformer. Over the last few months, it slowly transformed into it own - training the model on the TinyStories dataset that's been noted as a great value dataset and also I wrote its own [tokenizer](https://github.com/clankur/einygpt/blob/main/tiny_tokenizer.py) which was trained the TinyStories dataset.

Training a 6.9 million parameter model on a RTX4090 with the GPT2Tokenizer achieves results inline with the findings from the [TinyStories paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07759) and gets a perplexity of 1.0001 over the validation set. Additionally, training a 4.3 million parameter model with its [own Byte-Pair Encoding tokenizer](https://github.com/clankur/einygpt/blob/main/tiny_tokenizer.py) and using GQA w/ 4 groups achieves a comparable perplexity. Both models produce stories that have a logical flow and have a good grasp of grammar. You can compare their outputs side by side in this [notebook](https://github.com/clankur/einygpt/blob/main/perplexity.ipynb).

You can find the models on Hugging Face [here](https://huggingface.co/clankur/einygpt). Let me know what you think!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtYmRsbnVicm5pQWt3OXRnY2FKZUg2Nk1fQ0FKZzIzMDMwVWFSZmZxVGl1S0JrWWQ2UkFqNlFyWEdiRnZiOGU0TWU5RmtDVzFBMDROLUhnS25iUXM1bXc9PQ==

"As advice, start with deriving the forward and backprop equations for a simple logistic regression (no hidden layers). Then with one or two hidden layers. Then you can generalize to a one-directional RNN. As for advice for the algebra, the objects can at most become three dimensional (number of variables, observations and time-steps), write out everything at the scalar level, this will help you to see exactly what happens when multiplying two and three-dimensional matrices together to derive the dL/dparam jacobians/gradients.

Andrew NG's videos are very useful to familiarize yourself with RNNs.

"Great to hear you have a good foundation in Maths, me as well, although I specialized in Option Pricing, not Machine Learning. 

To summarize briefly, I have recently accepted an offer, my first assignments will be in the context of object detection (CNNs) and RNNs, given that I have done the Deep Learning specialization of Andrew Ng in the past I am resurfacing the theory and implementation. So it really depends on what type of DL engineering tasks you will be doing.

The first advice I can give you, is do the specialization, derive all algebra ALSO the backprop equations. This may take some time but I can promise you this will be EXTREMELY USEFUL in understanding many of the methodologies treated that have to do with parameter optimization speed/stability and why certain regulatization methods are proposed.

Also I highly recommend you to code the programming assignments from scratch and not to fill in the empty lines in a 90% complete code Coursera-style. Studying this way is the equivalent to receiving a poem, filling in three/four blank words and claiming that you wrote the poem. Once you can implement the algorithms in Numpy you can move to Tensorflow/Keras (which condense the model training steps in methods optimized for speed relative to numpy), which to my knowledge are still used in production.

 - Deep Learning Foundations and Concepts by Bishop;

Complement your learning by doing personal projects and study existing implementations by Meta, lucidrains or other well known devs to gain clean coding skills in ML (ex. use of einops, einsum, etc.).

"THE IRANIAN NVIDIA CHIP THREAT IS FAR MORE SERIOUS THAN YOU THINK.


Unfortunately, in my recent research, Iran is a major buyer of Nvidia A.I. chips that can process information 1000 times faster than normal CPUs. Leaked government reports have indicated that Iran's desire is to use A.I. to break into the U.S. infrastructure, including our water supply and power grid. Some reports indicate there has been successfully implanted malware and worms that are already laying dormant in our outdated infrastructure. Some reports indicate that at least 50 cases of malware infected infrastructure computers in some major cities in the U.S. From my recent research from reputable independent sources, the biggest fear is an attack on the Nations power grid. The U.S. conducted a security test on the ability to shut down the type of generators that are used on our grid. Not only were they able to take control of the generator remotely, but they also caused it to dramatically increase the spin speed and then forced the generator to spin in reverse. Within a few seconds, the generator, thought to be indestructible, exploded into flames. One study has predicted that if a cyber attack was able to shut down only 3 substations, the North Eastern power grid would go down and plunge 7 or more states into total darkness for up to 18 months. The study further concluded that if a cyber attack caused 9 substations to fail, it would put the entire U.S. into total darkness and calculated that it could take years to fix. Behind the scenes, the government is highly concerned that Iran's plan to take down the U.S. without a shoot or missile fired, seems to not only be a credible threat, but it seems it is highly likely that the Iranian backed hackers have already planted numerous types of malware into the infrastructure computers and is only waiting to implement their plan. Greater fears have been raised since the beginning of the war between Russia (backed by Iran) and Ukraine.  Also, considering the Palestinian and Israeli conflict has once again brought the U.S. to the center of attention concerning the Middle East's unstable condition. Recently, the news reported that the U.S. is considering, and most likely will, supply Ukraine with misses that can target locations deep within Russia. Russia has already warned the U.S. of a strong response if they do. With Iran, Russia,China, and North Korea in alliance, a threat to Russia is a threat to all. I suggest that all of you do your own research and comment on my post on what you find and decern from the information. Thanks for reading. 

BTW, one interesting source that I found was some basic information supporting my conclusions on the Microsoft website itself. Microsoft's O.S. is part of the problem, and some  of their operating system's security weaknesses is how the hackers were able to plant the worms and malware. 

*To confirm the ability of malware's ability to destroy an infrastructure, Iran's nuclear power plant's controlling computer systems were infected back as early as March, 2010 and remained dormant, by, what has been reported, a concerted effort between the U.S. and Israel. The probable target is widely suspected to be uranium enrichment infrastructure in Iran. following is a paragraph from Wikipedia concerning this malware code named ""Stuxnet"". The worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to degrade physically. The Wikipedia information is very detailed and is well worth reading first if you want to research this threat further. Below is the link to the Wikipedia page dealing with the Stuxnet Project.

"Hey there! I understand that you're new to this, so I'm happy to offer some guidance.

For classifying your data, you can use a technique called **supervised learning**. This involves using your three rows of values (features) to train a model that can predict the community names (labels). You'll need to choose a specific classification algorithm, such as **random forest** or **support vector machines**.

Once you've trained your model, you can use it to classify new data. Simply input the three values for a new community, and the model will output the predicted community name.

**Here's a suggested workflow:**

1. Gather your data into a spreadsheet or CSV file.
2. Import your data into a machine learning library like **Scikit-learn**.
3. Split your data into training and test sets.
4. Choose a classification algorithm and train your model on the training set.
5. Evaluate your model's performance on the test set.
6. Use your trained model to classify new data.

**Further learning:**

"It's definitely worth trying! Data augmentation can often improve the performance of pre-trained models. The accuracy change depends on the specific dataset and augmentation techniques used.

"Overlapping bounding boxes can definitely lead to precision issues in object detection models like YOLO. When objects are close together or partially occluded, the model may struggle to accurately predict individual bounding boxes and assign them to the correct objects. This can lead to incorrect predictions and lower overall precision.

To mitigate this issue, you could try using a different object detection algorithm that handles overlapping bounding boxes better, such as Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN. These algorithms typically employ more sophisticated region proposal and bounding box refinement techniques that can better handle complex object interactions and overlapping situations.

Additionally, you could try experimenting with different data augmentation techniques to create a more diverse and challenging training set. This can help the model learn to generalize better to real-world scenarios where overlapping objects may be common.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJub0Uxb2FRd1VtYVFEVUxJc21IOUM5YUdReERpTTBnVFZicU5jcGxmYTdReEgyb2dFdnBmdnhGeEM1ZW1SdmgtOUgyTTFRTkt3dUdJY0JSY2RUZ2oyZ2c9PQ==

To answer your second question: I aim to identify dynamic changes in variables that precede complications. For example, if two blood values rise concurrently with another variable, I want to predict the complication based on these dynamic interactions.

Regarding your last question: yes, explainability is crucial. I need to understand which thresholds or delta increases in these dynamic variables are significant for predicting complications. This will help in determining the critical factors contributing to the complications.

"The vanishing of the posterior in VAE image generation can indeed make it easier to generate images from random noise, as the model learns a more deterministic mapping from the latent space to the image space. However, it also means that the model is less able to capture the diversity of the data, as the posterior distribution becomes more concentrated around a single point. This can lead to images that are less realistic and more repetitive.

To mitigate the effects of posterior vanishing, various techniques have been proposed, such as using a wider prior distribution or regularizing the posterior distribution. These techniques can help to improve the diversity and quality of generated images.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJubDd4Ykt2RU5sdUFuSGFvVG81OVFWb2pBQ2UxZDFJaVE3X1hLLU9zTTJhMVlKallfdjM5dzlweUhtZjVqVEUzekNjdFdYcTdUWHNXeFdyd1BoSVRwN0E9PQ==

"Different datasets have different ranges and distributions, so it makes sense that different weight initializations are needed to get good performance. PyTorch mitigates this issue by providing a variety of weight initialization methods that you can choose from. For example, you can use `torch.nn.init.kaiming_normal_` for ReLU activations or `torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform_` for tanh activations. These methods initialize the weights to be within a certain range, which helps to prevent the network from saturating.

In your case, you're using a very small weight initialization, which is probably why you're not getting good performance on the XOR dataset. Try using a larger weight initialization, such as `self.w = tensor(np.random.rand(out_feat, in_feat))` and see if that improves your results.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUUhRbngxR0Y1dmlMbEE2RWtnbFl4NlZMRUQwVlR0SFhSb3VBVHhYZGFlWTNTTE4yZ2FuNno1SVBsLURkWmJmRmx0ZUxsN3owT3lNZFdnS0VpMFZjY0E9PQ==

"It's all because of the magnitudes of your initializations.

np.random.rand() is random numbers with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.

In the top one, that means your weights are initialized between 0 and 0.0001. So, basically 0. It only happens to work because you don't normalize your inputs, i.e. the values of unormalized MNIST is max 255, which cancels out some of your ""/ 10000"".

In the bottom one, you are semi properly initializing your weights to an okay range 0 to 1, and your inputs I'm guessing are also 0 to 1. I would probably set the range to -1 to 1.

"Hey there! I've been working with Stable Diffusion for a while and I think I have some insights that might help you.

To handle different image resolutions, you'll need to use a model that supports dynamic shape. One option is to use the [Stable Diffusion 2.0 model](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v2-base), which is trained on a diverse dataset of images with varying resolutions.

Another approach is to use a [resolution-aware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03578) technique. This involves training the model with images of different resolutions and using a special layer that adjusts the model's behavior based on the input resolution.

Here are some additional resources that might be helpful:

"Hey there!

3D reconstruction from multiple cameras can be a bit tricky, but here's a general workflow:

1. **Calibrate your cameras**: This involves finding the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each camera. You can use a tool like OpenCV's calibrateCamera() function.
2. **Find feature correspondences between images**: Use feature detection and matching techniques to find points that appear in multiple images.
3. **Estimate the camera poses**: Given the correspondences, you can use techniques like PnP or bundle adjustment to find the position and orientation of each camera.
4. **Create a point cloud**: Project the corresponding points into 3D space using the camera poses. This will give you a set of 3D points.
5. **Generate a mesh**: Finally, you can use a mesh generation algorithm to create a surface from the point cloud.

"Don't waste your time reading an 11 year old PhD thesis on a relatively niche part of deep learning (RNNs).

Yes, build some projects. Use PyTorch/Keras, and use example projects from open source GitHub libraries to learn how to break down the project into modular, adaptable components. Become familiar with cloud training and ML pipelines in AWS and GCP, and learn to deploy the generated artifacts. Use Kaggle for datasets if you're looking for interesting problems to address that have also had a lot of community effort  directed towards them. Read Deep Learning by Goodfellow for a good survey of the field. Know the basics of feed forward networks, recurrent networks, Seq2Seq, CNNs, DQNs, GANs, diffusion models, and Transformer architectures. Learn to read original research papers (esp. the ones with the most citations), and maybe try implementing a few from scratch. Check out the top papers from NeurIPS and ICLR from the past 10 years if you want a good starting point. Learn basic machine learning methodology, as a deep learning model is only as good as the data, features, and metrics you feed it.

O'Reilly, Packt, and Manning all have great books on deep learning with particular frameworks. I'd go with one based on PyTorch, preferably published in either 2023 or 2024. I'd also pick up a book that's focused on doing deep learning in the cloud (or at least machine learning, since they'll usually have a chapter or two on deep learning specific projects). Non-trivial models will require some good hardware that will necessitate cloud training if you don't want to make a big investment in a deep learning rig. I'd recommend one that uses AWS' Sagemaker, since that's going to have the most up-to-date published resources.

"Hey there,

In your industrial process scenario, since you can't simulate the environment, you'll need to use online training. Here's how you can approach it:

1. **Collect Initial Data:** Gather a batch of real samples (e.g., 50-100) to train your model initially.
2. **Train the Model:** Use the collected data to train your DQN model.
3. **Checkpoint Model:** Once the model converges, save its weights as a checkpoint.
4. **Deploy and Evaluate:** Load the checkpoint model and deploy it on the real industrial process. Monitor its performance and make any necessary adjustments.

Avoid continuously training the model online, as it can lead to overfitting and poor performance.

"Hi there! I took a look at your code and I think I see what the issue is. In your `train.py` file, you're using the `ImageCaptionDataset` class to load the Flickr-30k dataset. This class doesn't seem to be loading the captions correctly. Specifically, the `__getitem__` method is returning a tuple of (image, caption), where `caption` is a list of strings. However, the VIT model expects a single string as input.

To fix this, you can modify the `__getitem__` method to return a tuple of (image, caption_string), where `caption_string` is a single string obtained by joining the list of strings in `caption`. Here's the modified code:

```
def __getitem__(self, idx):
    image = Image.open(self.image_paths[idx]).convert(""RGB"")
    caption = self.captions[idx]
    caption_string = "" "".join(caption)
    return image, caption_string

"100% yes, and I’ll give you two reasons to justify this:

1) There’s an infinity of tasks where using LLM/VLMs would be inefficient and redundant. For instance, take self-driving cars: if you want to use an algorithm to do object tracking, you are going to use a moderately sized CNN/ViT over LLM/VLMs as its likely to outperform on the task, it’s several magnitudes of order faster and it doesn’t require an H100 to run, which would drain the battery of an electric car in about 10 minutes.

However, I've used only the encoder part of the transformer for my classification task.

"In general, using multiple smaller GPUs will not provide a performance boost over a single larger GPU for LLMs unless the model is too large to fit on a single GPU. If your LLM model is within the memory capacity of a single 3090, you won't see any benefit from using multiple 2060 Supers. However, if your model is larger than 24GB (the memory capacity of a 3090), then using multiple 2060 Supers could potentially provide a performance boost, although it will likely be less than a linear scaling of the number of GPUs used.

"Try using a smaller learning rate or a different optimizer. The default Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005 may be too aggressive for your dataset and is causing the model to overfit to the training data.

Also, check your data preprocessing pipeline to ensure that the training and test data are processed in the same way. If the preprocessing is different, it could lead to the model performing differently on the training and test data.

Lastly, consider adding some regularization to the model, such as dropout or weight decay.

"Hey there!

I'm also a data science and AI student graduating in 2025, and I'm also on the hunt for a deep learning project. I've been exploring LLM and computer vision as well.

I get you on the feeling of frustration with standard projects and generic datasets. It's hard to find something truly groundbreaking and research-worthy. But don't give up!

Here's an idea that might spark your curiosity: using LLM to provide personalized recommendations for complex systems. For example, it could recommend optimal parameters for a machine learning model based on a user's specific task and constraints.

As for how to structure your research, maybe you could start by identifying a specific industry or application where deep learning can solve a real-world problem (e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing). Then, you can narrow down your focus by exploring specific challenges within that domain.

Remember, it's not just about coming up with a fancy algorithm. The key is to demonstrate how your project solves a meaningful problem and contributes to the advancement of deep learning research.

"**Comment:**

Hey, I've been working on a similar project. Here are a few tips that I found helpful:

- Start by binarizing your image using Otsu's method. This will create a black and white image where the handwritten words are white.
- Use morphological operations such as dilation and erosion to clean up the image and remove any noise.
- Find connected components in the image using OpenCV's `findContours` function. Each connected component represents a word.
- For each word, you can compute its bounding box and extract the text using a library like Tesseract.

I hope this helps! And if you're looking for a good read, I highly recommend ""Eternal Gods Die Too Soon"" by Beka Modrekiladze.

"Hey there! Sorry to hear you're having trouble with your image captioning model. I took a quick look at your code and noticed that you're using a learning rate of 1e-4. This is quite high, especially for a model with as many parameters as VIT+GPT. I would recommend trying a smaller learning rate, like 1e-5 or even 1e-6.

Another thing to check is the size of your batch. If your batch size is too large, it can lead to instability in the training process. I would recommend using a batch size of 16 or 32.

Finally, make sure that you are using the correct loss function. For image captioning, you should use the cross-entropy loss.

It's likely you're concatenating the sentences wrong. For BERT, the scheme is as follows:

- `input_ids`: `[CLS]` + `sequenceA_input_ids` + `[SEP]` + `sequenceB_input_ids`
- `segment_ids`: `CLS_segment_id` + `[sequenceA_segment_id] * len(sequenceA)` + `[sequenceB_segment_id] * (len(sequenceB) + 1)`
- `input_mask`: `[1] * len(input_ids)`

And after that you perform padding.

Anyways, it's not like you can concatenate the two sentences and then tokenize. Tokenizing these two is done in a special manner.

Seems fine at first glance.

However, if you intend to finetune only the 8B Mixtral, then you don't need these big cards. BERT doesn't take more than 20GB VRAM to finetune, and you could directly finetune a Mixtral expert with ~16 GB VRAM in FP16, let alone QLoRA. And even if you are looking at the 8x22B Mixtral, you can QLoRA it with 4x3090s, so, one server rig.

You could get like 10 machines with 20 3090s and 4090s in total with that kind of the money. The only issue would be the upkeep and cooling of said machines.

"Hey there! Don't panic! Here's a quick breakdown of how you can tackle this project:

**Step 1: Image as Single Lens of Stereoscopic Camera**

* Load the given RGB image.
* Define the parameters for the stereoscopic camera setup (e.g., baseline distance).
* Extract the left-eye and right-eye views from the RGB image.

**Step 2: Deep Learning for Second Lens Image**

* Choose a deep learning model for image reconstruction (e.g., U-Net).
* Train the model on a dataset of stereo image pairs.
* Use the trained model to generate the second-lens image from the left-eye view.

**Step 3: Qualitative and Quantitative Evaluations**

**Qualitative:**
* Visually compare the generated second-lens image with the original right-eye view.
* Check for accuracy, detail preservation, and artifacts.

**Quantitative:**
* Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to assess the reconstruction quality.
* Compare the results with existing methods or benchmarks.

**Organization Tips:**
* Break down each step into smaller tasks.
* Create a timeline and set milestones.
* Use a code repository to keep track of your project.
* Ask for help in online forums or Reddit communities if needed.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VjBSdHpDT3M1QkZRMDdDM0h3bENGWHdEbFRhelV2LVVDU1k5WC1KaFdvVnVJVF9NaHd2WGlya2hxOUkza0tmLUZicnlGN0FMVmxtRmZPUXhRYnBtRkE9PQ==

"Hey there! I've been in a similar boat before. It can be tough to navigate hardware when you're not super familiar with it.

The specs you've found seem like a good starting point. 2x A100s should be enough for most transformer training tasks, and 20TB of storage is plenty. The CPU with 32-64 cores is also good, as is the 256-512GB of RAM.

One thing to keep in mind is that RAM usage can vary depending on the specific transformer model you're training. If you're planning on training large models, you may want to consider getting 512GB of RAM.

Another thing to consider is the type of network interface you need. 10GbE is sufficient for most applications, but if you're planning on doing a lot of data transfer, you may want to consider 25GbE.

"I've had similar experiences with overfitting on MNLI using BERT. Here's what I've found helpful:

1. **Check your data:** Make sure your training data is clean and balanced. Overfitting can occur if your data has inconsistencies or biases.

2. **Try a different model:** There are many other pre-trained BERT models available, and they each have their strengths and weaknesses. Experiment with different models to see if one performs better for your task.

3. **Use data augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques can help create a more diverse training set, which can reduce overfitting. Try techniques like back-translation, paraphrasing, and synonym substitution.

4. **Adjust your training hyperparameters:** Overfitting can sometimes be reduced by adjusting training hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and regularization parameters. Experiment with different values to see what works best for your model.

5. **Early stopping:** Early stopping is a technique where you stop training the model if it starts to overfit on a validation set. This can help prevent the model from overfitting on the training data.

"If they published the weights then it is unlikely you will get better performance than just finetuning on that. Yeah, they used A100s because to pretrain you need loads of memory and time. The cost to pretrain a BERT was once 30k$, but even now it's still 2-3k$ with all the advancements. It's not feasible to do with consumer GPUs due to their nerfed tensor cores.

You generally can't pretrain any BERT model with just 80000 clinical notes. It's not about the hardware, there's just not enough data. Original BERT used around 3B tokens, but it is estimated you need way more than that to fully utilize it: possibly 10-100x more. In that regard the 4B words from the paper that probably amount to ~12B tokens are commendable, but unless your notes are 5x times as big as the one in the paper, you won't reach that token count. And it would be better for you to have even more - nowadays we train LLMs (which are admittedly much bigger than BERT) with 100B-10T tokens.

You can fine-tune with that amount, however. And for that you don't even need a A100. You can get by with as something as rudimentary as a 1080Ti, so a 7 year old GPU.

For pretraining any transformer you definitely need bigger GPUs, but it was my impression you only wish to finetune. Finetuning is much easier than pretraining despite both being similar. But if you need to pretrain, then yeah, A100s are currently the most cost effective. H100 would be better but they're like 3x the price, so not worth the cost. But either way you will have distributed training because no single GPU will be fast enough to pretrain a model in what someone would consider a reasonable amount of time.

---

You don't need to load the whole model onto the GPU. But the thing is that all of the models you mentioned already fit on individual consumer GPUs. The Mixtral ones, that are the biggest, can fit individual experts on different GPUs for example.

"Hey there! I'm not an expert in hardware, but I can offer some general advice.

First, it's important to consider the specific tasks you'll be performing on the GPUs. For fine-tuning large language models like BERT or Mixtral, you'll need a significant amount of VRAM. The A100 80GB GPUs you've mentioned have plenty of VRAM for these tasks.

Regarding RAM, 512GB is a good choice for your workload. It provides a good balance between capacity and cost.

As for other important factors, consider the operating system you'll be using and its support for multiple GPUs. Also, make sure the system has sufficient cooling to handle the heat generated by the GPUs.

Getting a PhD in AI could definitely boost your earning potential in academia or corporate. However, it's a significant investment, so it's crucial to weigh the costs and benefits.

Consider your career goals. If you aspire to lead research or teach, a PhD is a wise choice. But if you're primarily focused on industry experience, a Master's may suffice.

If you're leaning towards a PhD, I'd recommend exploring part-time options. It allows you to balance work and study, gaining practical experience while advancing your education.

"I see.

Take into consideration that the papers that run their experiments on A100 or whatever do not necessarily own the cards. After all, the most cost-effective way to pretrain models is in the cloud, not locally.

Furthermore, if this is a machine for more than 2 people concurrently, then you might have congestion issues. Just because the GPU has 80 GB of VRAM does not mean it will always be able to handle workloads that sum up to 80 GB of VRAM. Once someone takes up all the processing power of the GPU, no matter how much VRAM you have left you will not be able to start another task on the GPU without slowdown for both parties.

So, for example, if two people are training a model, each on a separate A100, and they are both fully utilizing the GPU, you either can't train anything else, or the third person running something on a GPU will incur a slowdown. Doesn't matter if they have 1 or 100GB free, the core can only handle a set amount of operations per second. And sometimes heavily congested GPUs crash as well.

Nothing really forces you to use A100. For example, where I work at, we pretty much exclusively use consumer cards (because they're cheaper) and if we need more VRAM, it's easier to just run it in the cloud. Of course, if you need the large VRAM amount for let's say longer than a month, then it's not worth, but obviously it's not worth spending 20k$ per GPU if you only sometimes need more than 24 GB VRAM, either.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3TmF5ZDFHN2R1NWNIeU9jMWE1TUx1V0haOXVmQjczS0wxc1lUZWxWM05lbTV6V3R6LVBFQ3VIdS1aWDJHLTZlakxkcUdZN2hxMUZJY2lUUzRodUM4LWc9PQ==

I can definitely understand feeling a bit lost when it comes to purchasing hardware, especially with a limited understanding of it.

Firstly, the specs you've provided look pretty solid for your needs. You'll want to make sure you have enough VRAM for your models, and 80GB per GPU should be sufficient for BERT and similar models. The amount of RAM is also important, and 512GB will give you plenty of breathing room.

One other factor to consider is the type of interconnect between the GPUs. NVLink is the fastest option, but it can also be more expensive. PCIe 4.0 is a good compromise between speed and cost.

"Hey there!

I've also been working with BERT on MNLI and can relate to some of your observations. I've found that concatenating premise and hypothesis can lead to overfitting, especially if you're not using data augmentation techniques.

Approach 2 seems to be a more efficient way to use BERT, particularly without the attention mask or token type IDs. This suggests that the model may be able to focus more on the semantics of the text rather than the structure.

To address overfitting, you could try the following:

- Use a smaller learning rate.
- Add dropout regularization to your model.
- Use early stopping to stop training when the model starts to overfit.
- Try using a different optimizer, such as AdamW.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3X0VlSlU1Sl9DSjdDN2lYRmxFYmZ4SE5wN0xsVnhXTUFNQjA4cmdobXdBRmh1d2RMMnlOSllmX180YUlPNVdicHB4UW12TkZ1WnROUXljNkpjUXF2NkE9PQ==
"The German Data Protection Laws are preventing me from using the cloud, since we are not allowed to share patient data. A cluster that was funded for such purposes refuses to take sensible data. I also wanted to go with renting GPUs. 

We have already like 20 small 16GB GPUs that are virtualized in the whole institute. So if needed, people with small jobs can use them and people with transformers for example can use the A100s.

I already configured DeepSpeed but our IT refuses to give me access to all the GPUs to distrubute my training over the small GPUs and they can not understand that I need more than two 4GB virtualized GPUs.
 
But I think you really have valide points there. 

Maybe a Cluster with 48GB GPUs would be also something to think about, where just my working group has access. There I could use parallelization as much as I want. I just didnt want to because I am scared of terrible unfixable Bugs.

"Hey there!

It sounds like you've got a challenging task ahead of you, but I'm happy to try and help. First off, let's break down the specs you've found so far:

**GPUs:** 2x A100 (80GB) GPUs are definitely a solid choice for training transformers and fine-tuning LLMs. They offer great performance and memory capacity.

**Storage:** 20TB NVMe storage is also a good amount for storing your models and datasets.

**CPU:** A CPU with 32-64 cores is also appropriate. The more cores, the better for multi-tasking and handling large models.

**RAM:** 512GB RAM is definitely the better option here. Transformers and LLMs can be memory-intensive, so the more RAM you have, the better.

**Network Interface:** 10GbE or 25GbE is a good choice for a network interface. It will provide you with sufficient bandwidth for your training needs.

**Other Factors to Consider:**

* **Power Supply:** Make sure the system has a powerful enough power supply to handle the GPUs and other components.
* **Cooling:** Proper cooling is essential to prevent overheating and ensure stability.
* **Operating System:** Choose an operating system that is optimized for deep learning, such as Ubuntu or CentOS.
* **Software:** You'll need to install the necessary deep learning frameworks and software libraries.

Overall, the specs you've found seem reasonable for your needs. I would recommend going with the 512GB RAM option and making sure the cooling and power supply are adequate. Good luck with your research!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4MFI1X3NpcTNOeUMyVnMyQWhTX2pCUzFDYmRtLWdpVGtBSjVjRE1XMlh2dFM3Nk5GNEtzMzV1NDFFS1ZoOC01NlFNcEZrcUlVMWxXUi0yRWkxUUJ4N0E9PQ==

"That's interesting. You are not really sharing data with cloud providers, but I completely understand if you don't want to get in trouble for not well defined laws and rules or appoint data protection officers etc.


Ah then completely fine. Then it makes sense to go for the A100. The 48 GB cluster would work, but you should compare their processing power with the A100. For example, a RTX 6000 has 48GB but is more than twice slower than the A100, yet not even half price. So it doesn't make sense.


Furthermore, for CV stuff, you want the biggest GPU in regards to RAM since you need the biggest batch size per GPU you can get for batch normalization to work properly.


You are definitely right on Swin on small cards. You don't need A100, but with what you described I would get AT LEAST one, because that is what you lack at the moment. But if you decide for 1 GPU, getting a H100 might be better: it is more expensive but also much faster. And in practice 1xH100 will train faster than 2xA100. So that's also one thing to think about.


I would personally get 2x A100 in your situation if buying new, or 1x H100 if you can find it for around 30-35k euros, but that's unlikely.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4aTMydFo2NWVteDJEUTcwLUlXeWpXYnM4VmplM01WQkk0QUFyX3RuTGlDWmtEeUMxb1pUVWZSSldEOFhRRzd2VHhmVmNwNnhrRnhsVEQybE1EV21pUmc9PQ==

Just don't over augment though.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4VzlEVXdMcnRzcU5URGRNV0stQVJKeFpVRk9hcTdiTzZSUl9Qd3psT3NkWFVNMXZoT1JtYUtfMjNSeFg5WHJLLTNKRURCSEpndFVmX2UySWJmSTE1Qmc9PQ==
"This might not be what you are looking for but I'll still say it.

First of all, terms online and offline (in RL) refer to agent's ability to re-use previously collected data. Offline means you can collect some data (it can be human expert data, or it can be the old checkpoint of the model) and then you can do as many gradient updates as you want. Online algorithms, on the other hand, require you to collect NEW data (interactions with environment) each time you want to make a gradient update. Availability of a simulation has nothing to do with it. 

So when you mention the absence of simulated environment what I see is you need to be data efficient. That means you want to solve with the least amount of env interactions as possible. That also means you probably want to re-use old data from previous (failed) trainings because letting computer to operate your thing is costly. So I would look at offline, probably even full offline methods. In terms of data-efficiency the best is model based approaches where you train a network to ""simulate"" future, then offline, then online. Create a dataset, even as you go, of interactions with environment, train on it, then test in real life.

The biggest problem in that case would be to not overfit to past data (if you aren't collecting new data during training). In terms of keywords I would look for [Implicit Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06169), [Conservative Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04779). Some time ago I watched [youtube RL course](https://www.youtube.com/@rail7462) by Sergey Levine, Berkeley, his students do lots of publications on real life offline learning, so googling the guy's name would probably be a good start. Can't give you the most recent RL news though.

By the way, you shouldn't try implementing things on your own. There are bunch of RL libs for \\*put your favorite language here\\*.

"BERT is a really a small model (its not an LLM), you can finetune on a single GPU consumer card like a 4090 that costs 2000$ or even older like 2080 Ti from my experience.

Mixstral is much, much bigger (dozens of times) and its a decoder architecture ,not an encoder only like BERT that can do classification but not generation. If you hesitate between such two different models maybe you need to think more about what you really need, because to me it shows your project is not well prepared enough.

Otherwise, having 80 GB GPUs is probably the most comfortable thing for finetuning big models without doing things like model sharding/checkpoint activations. But they're very expensive. a 4090 would be as fast as an A100 to my knowledge, while costing 10 times less... So you really need to think if you need that extra VRAM (above 24GB). Note that those data center cards need external cooling, they dont have fans like gamer cards. So you may need extra infastructure. Also maybe H100 would me better than A100 but I am not sure about the price gap.

Also the 5090 will be released at the end of the year, with maybe even more VRAM.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4cS11aTgtbjk3NlozNlVKeFlNQnNRdWowRDRkV25mcHVLeXRqOHRhbVVTX1l2dzhJLWhtSEhTcHpWSzNvWW1Xc0IxX2ZEbk1KczlTelRIYlBsNTNiYWc9PQ==

* **Lens Projection:** Project the image from the second lens based on the depth map and the camera's intrinsic parameters.

1. Overfitting after 10 epochs is a bit unusual. Have you tried using a smaller learning rate or increasing the batch size?

"Hey there! Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with using TPUs on Kaggle, so I can't provide specific guidance on that. However, I can offer some general advice that might be helpful.

First, make sure you're using the correct libraries and commands for working with TPUs. You may need to import specific modules or initialize the TPU runtime before you can start training your model.

As for choosing between a TPU and a GPU, it depends on the specific needs of your model and the resources available to you. TPUs are generally more powerful than GPUs, but they can also be more expensive and harder to configure. For training an NLP model for sentiment analysis, a GPU may be sufficient.

If your model training is taking too long, you can try saving your notebook progress periodically by clicking the ""Save"" button in the notebook editor. This will create a checkpoint that you can later restore to resume training.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4d285Uk50d1JLaUZUS21lMTFhc2laZ2Z0amZ4VDhKQ1NrUHRGMERhRk1lOHBfM1ZIdnBQb19IOGxsYU90amc4VE5GS241UmQweFNWSWVaT2w0YnlreEE9PQ==

"Hey there! I'm also just getting started with LSTM networks, and I've found this guide to be super helpful for beginners: [link to beginner-friendly LSTM guide].

As for transfer learning, I'd recommend checking out this paper: [link to paper on transfer learning for streamflow prediction]. It provides a good overview of the topic and some tips for getting started.

One thing to keep in mind is that LSTM networks can be pretty computationally expensive to train, so if you're working with a limited dataset, you might want to consider using a smaller network or a pre-trained model.

In the second cell, your learning rate is 2e-2 in contrast to 2e-3 in the above cell. As 2e-2 is quite high this could lead to your model diverging. It could also be a problem with your data as one epoch takes 0 seconds, but it is impossible to answer with the code you provided.

Additionally, the code is not equivalent. The one\\_cycle method uses a learning rate scheduler. It increases and decreases your learning rate once over the course of the number of epochs you provide. In the first cell, you have 10 epochs; in the second, you have 10 x 1 epoch, which therefore increases/decreases the learning rate 10 times.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZVRSU3BGUXoxVUNOOV9GTmwyOHFnUmxnY0lodnFzWnBHaUc3WHpPOU12QVM5TC1QTUZha3lSbHE4Z3RuX2gtcUhvbmRZMVZnSUhZWkx4TnFaZlhtLWdyc0pxeVVqWGN0eEh3SmFyNGhuaGs9

Have you worked through any of the more mainstream texts on the subject? If you run into issues, I bet someone in one of these programs (or even in this sub) would help since you're obviously serious. Ask lecturers, PhD students and TAs for support first, as faculty can be challenging to contact.

I had a listen to some of the samples on your GitHub page and I'm really impressed with the quality of the TTS. It sounds very natural and expressive, and it's definitely one of the best open source TTS models I've heard.

I'm particularly impressed with the way the model handles prosody. The intonation and emphasis are very well done, and it really helps to bring the text to life.

I'm also very excited about the fact that the model is open source. This makes it possible for anyone to use and modify the model, which could lead to some really great applications.

"The training data doesn't match the input size of the network because the network is trained in a hierarchical fashion. It first learns to upscale 64x64 to 256x256, then 256x256 to 1024x1024. This allows the network to focus on smaller, more manageable tasks at each stage, which ultimately helps it achieve better results on the final task of upscaling 256x256 to 1024x1024.

Using smaller crops also helps to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. By training on a variety of smaller crops, the network is forced to learn the underlying features of the data rather than just memorizing specific details. This makes it more likely to perform well on new, unseen data.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5cDJEUFkxeW5BX21Pa3c0Sk0tYVRhM2ZxcTlFTDhQZDRVb3pwZzUxMjFhd25RVFg2dTNpdWxGbHZPaTJSN1hJb3RiYXExSUUya010ckpUWjlaNm9zSWc9PQ==

"I've been curious about this myself! I'll definitely check out the video you linked.

From what I understand, CNNs basically chop up an image into smaller pieces and then apply filters to each piece to extract features. The filters are like little templates that look for specific patterns, like edges or corners. The output of each filter is a 2D map, which shows how strongly the filter responds to the corresponding part of the image.

As the network goes deeper, the filters get more complex and start to combine the lower-level features to form more abstract representations of the image. For example, a filter might combine edge detectors to form a filter that looks for eyes or noses.

The final layer of the network is typically a fully connected layer that takes the output of the last convolutional layer and classifies the image based on the features it has learned.

I'm still learning about CNNs myself, but I find them to be a fascinating and powerful tool for image recognition and classification.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5VUlEV2RNcjdLMU8zZ0FxaWZ3ai1BY2FEYXZIUnd1VDJxOEtpQ3dIOVNlSFBZSjl4NmQ5Z05EVHhJeVRycEVNRmpoRERJVHRoOG5PenNJeDk1QTVMLUE9PQ==

"Hey there! It seems like you're facing a tricky normalization issue with your synthetic dataset. To tackle this, try these steps:

1. **Check the Mean and Standard Deviation Values:** Ensure that the mean and standard deviation values you're using for normalization are correct. Try calculating them separately for both the synthetic and real datasets and compare them.

2. **Apply Different Normalization Techniques:** Explore alternative normalization methods like histogram equalization or batch normalization. These techniques might handle outliers better and preserve image information.

3. **Use Synthetic Data Augmentation:** Enhance the diversity of your synthetic dataset by applying various augmentations like rotations, flips, and color adjustments. This can help the model generalize better to the real dataset.

4. **Try Unsupervised Domain Adaptation:** Employ techniques like domain adaptation that can bridge the gap between the synthetic and real datasets. This can help the model learn features that transfer across both domains.

"Your model either diverged or overfit on noise. Be as it be, either decrease the learning rate, introduce gradient clipping, or train for longer.

Looking at your other comments, it seems you're doing a mistake of increasing the learning rate. So far, outside of annealing and warmup, there is no other working method where increasing the learning rate during training absolutely doesn't cause problems.

As a general rule of the thumb, the maximum learning rate is around 0.001 for SGD, 0.0001 for Adam, which is multiplied by roughly the cube root of the batch size. So for example, with a batch size of 1, the maximum learning rate for SGD is 1e-3 and Adam is 1e-4. However, with a batch size of 100, that becomes 4.6e-3 and 4.6e-4.

If we were to take your starting learning rate of 1e-4 and the cube root of 12 that is ~2.3, you can easily see that you're running a fairly large learning rate (1e-4 as opposed to rule of thumb maximum of 2.3e-4), which might indicate your model is simply diverging.

Your model seems to have encountered a very troubling sample, which for that learning rate shot your weights very far away from the convergence point, and that's visualized by the single-step spike of loss around where your accuracy was destroyed. The reason why your model can't recover like it did when it started training is likely because it already learned the strongest signals there are before the exploding gradient destroyed it, and there is nothing anymore to improve easily from. Your model can likely get itself out of this ordeal, but it would need 10, 100 or maybe even 1000 epochs. And even then it may or may not be worth it those 10, 100 or 1000 epochs.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5aERGY09nc1FmdFd5S2RMNEV6M21Cdm9qUkozMjY2RVloZmJoYVZKdUw0bHFBYlBReEo5YXJ0amxjRGRVcUQ1OTVEV2c1a3B2QklJM3FKZEx1QlNtcFE9PQ==

"Not necessarily. With a large enough model and a large enough dataset, when overfitting on noise you can overfit so hard that even your training accuracy suffers. That is apparent by your loss spike.

Look at it this way. Your model can learn both signal and noise. If your loss function rewards learning noise, and there is no signal to learn, or it's too hard to learn, then the only thing the model can do to decrease loss is to learn the noise. Your model does not see where the optimal weights are with the noise, it only sees the directions.

So your loss might mislead your model to go into a direction where it will have higher loss and lower training accuracy just because at one point the task was so hard that seemed like the best thing to do. And it might just happen that learning some kind of noise totally destroyed the signal you were learning.

We usually prevent this with big batch sizes. Batch sizes are a great way to accumulate signal, and if the noise is not really signal, it will on average cancel itself out.

As for your project, it sounds like you're trying to build a natural language interface to a data analysis pipeline. I've done something similar using spaCy for NLP and SQLAlchemy for the DB connection. Feel free to DM me if you want more details.

On the VIT base model issue, it could be overfitting or a data issue. Try increasing the regularization or checking the data for outliers.

For the phobia data, you might try searching for ""panic attack physiological data"" or see if there are any relevant clinical studies.

Regarding the normalization issue, maybe try using the mean and standard deviation calculated from your synthetic dataset instead of ImageNet.

I'm not familiar with diffusion models, but I'll see if I can find any papers on mode collapse for you.

"Sure, while fine-tuning isn't the typical use case for this type of task, here are some tips to approach fine-tuning a Llama3-8b instruct model with duplicate prompts and different responses:

* **Consider using a different fine-tuning approach:** Instead of traditional fine-tuning, you could explore methods like prompt engineering or adapter modules, which are more suitable for incorporating additional knowledge without drastically altering the base model.

* **Preprocess the dataset:** To mitigate the impact of duplicate prompts, preprocess your dataset by removing or merging duplicate entries. Alternatively, you could create clusters of similar prompts and generate a representative response for each cluster.

* **Incorporate a response consolidation mechanism:** During fine-tuning, implement a mechanism to consolidate multiple responses for the same prompt. This could involve averaging or concatenating the responses, or using an attention mechanism to weigh different responses.

* **Evaluate the model's performance:** Carefully evaluate the model's performance on both seen and unseen prompts to assess its ability to consolidate responses and generate coherent monologues. Consider using metrics like perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation.

Remember that fine-tuning a large language model can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and explore alternative approaches before committing to this method.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6SnJqa2xLRnlEV2p6dFdCanFBaF85czhYYUdyam1hSldYcGhHZHRIRmRQbmFEaXlzX0dWSUdoZ2NDVXg5ZHU5WVNGdGVEXzh5Sy11b3RvUm1QMF9qcHc9PQ==

"Awesome! I'll definitely check out the video series on deep neural networks and image classification. It sounds like a great resource for understanding the inner workings of CNNs.

Regarding your project where you need to take user input in natural language, retrieve data from an SQL DB, and perform data analysis, I suggest using a combination of Python libraries, such as nltk for natural language processing, pandas for data manipulation, and scikit-learn for data analysis.

As for your issue with training a ViT base model on a sign language dataset using MATLAB, it could be due to overfitting or insufficient data augmentation. Try experimenting with different regularization techniques, such as dropout or L2 regularization, and increase the variety of training data by applying random rotations, flips, and crops.

For the database containing information on trembling, heart rate, and body temperature related to phobia/panic attacks, I recommend checking out the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) website. They have a vast collection of resources and may be able to point you in the right direction.

Regarding the normalization transformations on a synthetic dataset, try using the dataset's own mean and standard deviation instead of ImageNet's. Since the synthetic dataset has different characteristics, using its own statistics should yield better results.

Lastly, for a laptop recommendation, if you run a lot of graph neural networks, the MacBook Pro 16 (2021) with the M1 Max chip would be a great choice. Its powerful GPU and optimized software will provide significant performance advantages.

"The MARS5-TTS model is a text-to-speech model that can generate high-quality audio from text. It's been trained on a large dataset of speech and text, and it can produce realistic and natural-sounding speech.

Unfortunately, the model does require a lot of hardware to run, so it's not accessible to everyone. However, there are some alternative ways to try it out.

One option is to use a cloud-based service that offers text-to-speech capabilities. These services typically have a pay-as-you-go pricing model, so you only pay for the resources you use.

Another option is to use a local text-to-speech tool. These tools are typically less powerful than cloud-based services, but they can still produce good-quality audio.

Here are some examples of cloud-based and local text-to-speech tools:

* Cloud-based: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech
* Local: Natural Reader, Balabolka, eSpeak

"Hey there! I've been exploring similar challenges with image segmentation and pseudo-labels lately. The ""Mean Teachers are Better Role Models"" approach you mentioned seems like a solid starting point.

One other method worth checking out is the ""Self-Training with Noisy Student"" technique. It uses a student-teacher paradigm, where the student is trained on the pseudo-labeled data, and its predictions are used to update the pseudo-labels. This iterative process helps refine the labels and improve the model's performance.

Loss functions that handle noise and uncertainty in pseudo-labels might also be helpful. The ""Confident Learning"" loss function, for instance, penalizes the model more heavily for errors on confident predictions, which can help mitigate the impact of less accurate pseudo-labels.

Keep in mind that training with pseudo-labels alone has its limitations, as the model may inherit biases or errors from the pseudo-labels. To improve the robustness of the model, consider incorporating data augmentation techniques and experimenting with different training strategies, such as curriculum learning or co-training.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1R0VEb0syYWpEQnJSU0lGU1M3WXNDNGRqTXNBTml1TDJpcW9VdUxPcDA1c0lTcGp6WjFBRWFlVTRtLTlZMFc3ekJkYjNqNG9NVXlQLUxiVnYxTUhjUkE9PQ==

"Definitely, working on image captioning problems in medical images is a promising topic for a master's thesis. Medical image captioning has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing automated and accurate descriptions of medical images, which can aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient monitoring.

To address your concerns, replicating and fine-tuning existing models on your own dataset is a valuable step in your thesis. While it may not be a groundbreaking scientific achievement in itself, it demonstrates your ability to apply and adapt state-of-the-art techniques to a new domain.

However, to make your thesis truly impactful, you should aim to go beyond replicating existing work. Consider exploring novel approaches, investigating specific medical image modalities (e.g., chest X-rays, MRI scans), or focusing on integrating your model with clinical workflows.

Additionally, you mentioned being concerned about competition in AI. It's important to remember that research is not a zero-sum game. Collaborate with others, seek guidance from your advisor, and focus on developing your own unique contributions to the field.

Regarding your question about publishing a paper, the potential for publication depends on the originality and significance of your work. If you can demonstrate a clear improvement over existing methods or introduce a novel approach, your findings could certainly warrant publication.

"Given your current knowledge and time constraints I'd suggest working through one of the many RAG tutorials on YouTube. Here's a good [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxpyO3ei4). At a minimum you'll come away with a decent understanding of embeddings and how they can be used regardless of the format of your data (text, PDFs, Word docs, etc.). Nothing is stopping you for using your own data (e.g. Project Gutenberg books, etc.). 

I doubt this will blow away your prospective employer but having something you can show off will count for something.

"On the contrary, production uses TFX/TF in large numbers, people are often fooled by PyTorch shares for various SOTA LLM models, but real-life business  is another story. PyTorch has no significant advantages over Keras with TF, not even mentioning Keras 3. 

AirBnB uses TF, Netflix, Airbus, PayPal, Twitter (they use both TF and PyTorch, you can see it on their GitHub repo), Spotify uses TFX extensively, I'm not even mentioning Google products. And that's a very small portion of large companies. Moreover, the release of Keras 3 is actually a pretty smart move, it brings the PyTorch devs closer to Keras and eventually the Google ecosystem, and not vice versa. 

For example, JAX is a real beast, especially for certain types of tasks, and the importance of the fact that you can now use JAX with existing Keras code  is yet to be fully realized by engineers.

"I haven't used Keras 3 yet, but I've heard good things about the multi-backend feature. From what I understand, your options are:

* Use Keras 2 with TensorFlow 2.14: This is the most stable option, but it doesn't have the latest features of Keras 3.
* Move to PyTorch: PyTorch is another popular deep learning library. It has a different API than Keras, but it's also very powerful.
* Try to get the admin to update the drivers: This is probably the most difficult option, but it would allow you to use Keras 3 with TensorFlow 2.16.

Personally, I would try to use Keras 2 with TensorFlow 2.14. It's the most stable option, and it will still allow you to use most of the features of Keras 3. If you're really interested in using the latest features of Keras 3, you could try to move to PyTorch. However, be aware that this will require you to learn a new API.

As for whether I like Keras, I think it's a great library. It's easy to use and it has a lot of features. I've used it for a variety of projects, and I've always been happy with the results.

"Sure, I can help you with that. Cloud computing providers like AWS, Azure, and GCS offer GPU computing services that allow users to rent access to powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of tasks, such as deep learning, machine learning, video encoding, and computer vision. These GPUs are housed in data centers and are accessible via the cloud, so users can provision them on demand and scale their usage up or down as needed.

One of the key benefits of using cloud-based GPU computing is that it eliminates the need for users to purchase and maintain their own GPU hardware. This can save a significant amount of money and time, as GPUs can be expensive and require specialized expertise to maintain. Additionally, cloud-based GPU computing provides users with access to the latest and greatest GPU hardware, which they may not be able to afford to purchase on their own.

In terms of the technology behind cloud-based GPU computing, providers typically use a variety of techniques to optimize performance and efficiency. These techniques include:

* **Virtualization:** GPUs are virtualized so that multiple users can share access to the same physical hardware. This is done using a software layer that abstracts the GPU hardware from the underlying operating system and applications.
* **Containerization:** GPUs can be packaged into containers, which are lightweight, portable, and self-contained software environments. This makes it easy to deploy and manage GPU-based applications across different cloud platforms.
* **Accelerated networking:** Cloud providers use high-speed networking technologies to minimize latency between GPUs and other resources, such as CPUs and storage. This helps to improve the performance of GPU-based applications.

"Hey there! I can relate to feeling stuck in a program that doesn't resonate with your passions. It's great that you discovered deep learning and have built a strong portfolio.

While an economics degree may not be a direct requirement for many job descriptions, it can still provide a solid foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. However, focusing on your deep learning skills and portfolio will definitely give you an edge in landing roles in the field.

My advice would be to continue developing your deep learning expertise and highlight your skills in your resume and cover letters.

"Yeah this is pretty doable. Consider training it on the context, because then you get to use a vector store anyway (Chroma, FAISS). Then maybe asking about retrieval or summarization etc. Chatting about the info afterward is pretty low hanging fruit. Also, when I say ""train"" I don't actually mean train, I mean index info about that topic and fire one up with a prompt that says do not use general knowledge and only answer using the context etc. There are specialized models for this on huggingface also but you can use most anything reasonable. YouTube and medium will make this very not difficult at a basic level. The biggest trick is knowing a lot of the vector stores and connective tissues for langchain or llama index are new and break often, so if one tutorial doesn't give you joy, scrap it and jump to different models and tooling. Trying to meaningfully interact with models trained on all documented knowledge when the tooling has hiccups is a pissing into the ocean type deal.

You could also look up ways to ""hack"" information out of them and demonstrate a variation on that theme, to show that deep learning and making someone do the electric slide with LLMs is not the same and kind of stupid. AI/ML is used every day to great effect; LLMs are a neat trick looking for a problem to solve, the training of specialized which is not accessible to mortal companies. 
That said some applications have done cool things with them. 
Yes, it is doable. Very. Pick or form a problem statement from some cursory YouTube on how to use LLMs for a custom use case and spare not the horses. Also use colab, you can't afford 6 hours of loading a model to find an error in your code. Unless you're rocking Adas or something for gaming, but even then...

"Hey there,

As a fellow technical writer with some experience in traditional ML models, I recently went through a similar situation for a job interview. Here's what I learned:

- **Is it possible in 2-3 days?** It's doable but requires some dedication. You'll need to allocate a few hours each day to learn and experiment.

- **Where to start:** I highly recommend the Hugging Face course on ""Using LLMs in NLP"": https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course. It provides a good introduction to using LLMs and walks you through a similar project.

- **Tips for optimization:**
   - Focus on understanding the core concepts rather than trying to cover everything.
   - Don't get stuck in endless research. Start building a simple demo as soon as possible.
   - Use pre-trained models and libraries to save time.

- **Don't give up:** The learning curve can be steep, but persist through the challenges.

Based on your experience, I think you have a good base to build on. With a focused effort and the right resources, you could pull off a passable demo. If you're passionate about the opportunity, go for it!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2cktIUWM4dmdPTmFfT1pEa3ZWY3hiWXNweDdVX1R4WUxrU2JzRVpXcWdFNG41bE9wZzVIUkIxRlhiN1VvWkVEWENWU1FJX01xUXVrY2RKdUNlN3Q1M1E9PQ==

"Hey there! It sounds like you're encountering some challenges with your object detection task. A couple of things to consider:

* **Data Quality:** Ensure your CSV file has accurate labels and that your images are properly preprocessed for the DL model.
* **Model Architecture:** VGG16 and CNN are classic architectures, but they may not be optimal for your specific task. Consider exploring more advanced models like ResNet or Faster R-CNN.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer to optimize your model's performance.
* **Training Strategy:** Ensure you have sufficient training data and use a training strategy that avoids overfitting or underfitting.

Here are some resources that might help:

Airbnb uses ONNX, and they even initially asked for ONNX support on the TF GitHub: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12888#issuecomment-327941342

Netflix also uses ONNX, example repo: https://github.com/Netflix/derand

Airbus uses Kubeflow to train their models, which under the hood runs TFX. And then they use TF Serving to serve it, which, let me remind you, is not really Tensorflow itself, but rather a serving platform.

"I think I have a pretty good understanding of what production is, and, to be honest, this is the first time I have heard that people do not need development frameworks there. Runtimes != production ML pipelines.

Ensure that when you say ONXX, you do not confuse it with ONXX Runtime. ONXX is just an exchange format (BTW, your first link is from 2017(!), we have tf2onnx now). When you say about inference, you probably mean ONXX Runtime, which can be compared with TFServing. Do companies use both ONXX Runtime and TFServing? Definitely, but it is only a part of the entire production pipeline.

And then you have TFX (where TFServing is only a tiny part of TFX), which manages an entire ML pipeline (data ingesting and validating, then model training and analysis, and deployment). The links you provided are mainly about the formats of particular models, not about production in general, since companies do not usually post information about their production ML pipelines, especially on GitHub. You can read about TFX here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx. By the way, this TFX page literally says that both Spotify and Twitter use TFX.

TFX is quite widely used in production. Keras 3, which has multi-backend support, is perfectly integrated with this entire process.

"Who is mentioning runtimes (besides you)?

The production pipeline doesn't have a R&D part. The production pipeline doesn't even have deployment in it (it's part of its own cycle). So there is no reason to have any development framework within production since you do not run that code, anyways.

> Ensure that when you say ONXX, you do not confuse it with ONXX Runtime.

I am ensuring that. Are you? That's why I said that ONNX is the only universal part of production, and not ONNX runtime (because it isn't).

Yeah, my first link is from 2017 to show to you that even before ONNX was popular Airbnb dabbled with ONNX in production, contrary to your claims.

It would be great if you didn't read beyond what I actually said, because I don't mean that.

> TFX is quite widely used in production. Keras 3, which has multi-backend support, is perfectly integrated with this entire process.

TFX at this point has 2 major points of overlap with TensorFlow:

- the branding
- importing TF models as one of the possibilities

Saying TFX (or TF Serving) := TensorFlow is a classic fallacy of composition. It's misleading at the very least, even with no ill intent. Imagine someone said that because a company uses PyTorch Lightning to train production models, PyTorch is used in production.

Or imagine if someone said that using TF Serving to serve models (even though both PyTorch, JAX, and other models can be served by it) means TF is used in production. Oh, wait...

Perhaps the funniest thing is that you even said this yourself at the end of the comment, yet do not (seem to?) see the irony...

> So, stating that ONNX is the only universal solution for runtimes is a bit farfetched.

Yeah, I agree it's ridiculous to say that, but so far you're the only one to have said that. I recommend going back to my original statement and reading it again.

"Hi,

For human activity recognition with CNN-LSTM models, here's a brief guideline:

**Data Preprocessing:**

* Resize and normalize images for consistency.
* Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

**Model Architecture:**

* **CNN:** Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to extract image features.
* **LSTM:** Add an LSTM layer to the output of the CNN for sequential modeling of image sequences.

**Training:**

* Set appropriate hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
* Use cross-entropy loss function and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
* Train the model on the training set.

**Evaluation:**

* Validate the model on the validation set.
* Evaluate the model's accuracy and loss on the test set.

**Additional Tips:**

* Consider using data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, cropping) to prevent overfitting.
* Experiment with different CNN-LSTM architectures to optimize performance.
* Use a GPU for faster training if possible.

For the UCF Crime dataset specifically, you can find helpful tutorials and resources online.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2S3J3dGdzNDVMTzkzOTd2ZDNPT242T0prNVpoLTNaMlE3Wl94ZDdiVTBpWGJVZ2FFYWg2ZE1WRDNNOGZ3bjVqaUF3STExZkNZYWxuZ1ZiV2U1Qzc5a1E9PQ==
"1) Try the Wasserstein Distance loss function, which measures the distance between the distributions of the generated and target images.

2) Extracting masks and treating it as a classification problem could work, but the differentiability of the IOU loss depends on the implementation and the specific model architecture.

3) Splitting the model into two parts could be effective, especially if the segmentation task is relatively straightforward.

"Yes, it seems to mix up the batches before performing `f.conv1d`. This is because the `view(-1, h, t)` operation reshapes the input tensor into a single batch of size `b * h * t`. This is then passed to `f.conv1d`, which applies the convolution operation to each sample in the batch.

The output of the convolution operation is then reshaped back into the original batch size and number of channels, using the `view(b, c, -1)` operation.

This mixing of batches is necessary because `f.conv1d` expects a single batch of data as input. However, it is important to note that the convolution operation is still applied to each sample in the batch individually, so the output of the model will be the same as if the batches had not been mixed.

In your example, the input tensor has a shape of `32, 64, 4`, which means that there are 32 batches, each with 64 channels and 4 timesteps. The output tensor has a shape of `32, 64, 1`, which means that there are still 32 batches, but each batch now has 64 channels and 1 timestep.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ci1ZR0lXbzlKYjBaeFJMdEFManN0ZWRQWVdjZ0xZOHZnMHljZHU2T3RuS1pwdHVxVkpVSmhCNGFyUzREd3Z2ODZxWVBUdUdaVVVqNTUzT1NQMUFZWVE9PQ==

"Typically you would employ dimensionality reduction approaches such as PCA. However, these will not be able to extract meaningful dimensions from just one row since it’s impossible to extrapolate a new low dimensional space from just one point in a high dimensional space.

However, depending on the problem you’re working on, others may have done that for you by training a model on in-sample (=similar) data for your data point.

If your data is text, you’ll find plenty of deeplearning models that have been trained on various types of text data, using various targets.

Most of these models can help with reducing your data point‘s dimensionality as their bottleneck features may be used as dense representations of the inputs.

That type of models sometimes are called ‚embedders‘ or embedding-models as they embed high-dimensional input into low-dimensional (dense) features.

Same applies for image data and, in theory, for any dataset.

"Hey there!

I've stumbled upon research that digs into the nitty-gritty of machine learning (ML) algorithms for iris-based user identification and verification. It's quite a fascinating read! ML excels in this task because it can effectively handle the complexities and variability inherent in iris patterns.

Here's a key research article that explores the inner workings of these ML algorithms: [""Iris Recognition Using Machine Learning Techniques: A Review"" by Dhawan et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354626622_Iris_Recognition_Using_Machine_Learning_Techniques_A_Review)

As for a hands-on GitHub repo, check out this [Iris Recognition System using ML](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/Iris-Recognition-System-using-ML) project. It provides a great starting point for getting your hands dirty with ML for iris-based tasks.

"It's possible that your model is not learning grammatical cues due to the randomness introduced by the softmax function. The softmax function ensures that the probabilities of the output characters sum to 1, but it does not guarantee that the model will select the most likely character at each time step.

To fix this, you can use a different output function such as the cross-entropy loss function. The cross-entropy loss function penalizes the model for selecting the incorrect character at each time step, which encourages the model to learn the most likely characters.

Here is an example of how to implement the cross-entropy loss function in your model:

```python
def loss_fn(outputs, targets):
    loss = 0
    for i in range(len(targets)):
        loss += -np.log(outputs[i][targets[i], 0])
    return loss / len(targets)

"In the forward method of the `lightweightconv1d` model, the line `input = input.view(-1, h, t)` reshapes the input tensor from shape `(b, c, t)` to `(b * h, c, t)`. This means that the batch dimension and the head dimension are combined, so that the convolution operation is performed across all batches and heads simultaneously.

This is necessary because the convolution operation in `f.conv1d` expects a tensor of shape `(b, c, t)` as input, where `b` is the batch size, `c` is the number of input channels, and `t` is the number of time steps. By reshaping the input tensor to `(b * h, c, t)`, the model effectively combines the batch and head dimensions into a single batch dimension.

After the convolution operation is performed, the output tensor is reshaped back to its original shape `(b, c, t)` using the line `output = output.view(b, c, -1)`. This ensures that the output tensor has the same shape as the input tensor, and that the batch and head dimensions are separated again.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2REpuMElZMDJwWExLZ0hJdjBiWEVlOHhPTjNpYjl5NE5PZllGWnRoQmQwWEo5WnhUU2RPNWVRekk4dmVoS2FZNTZGLWcwSEY5X3dRclA0bUh6NXUyT0E9PQ==

"Hey there! I've worked with the UCF crime dataset before and found it really useful for activity recognition. Here's a quick guide that might help:

1. **Preprocess the images:** Resize and normalize the images to a consistent format.
2. **Split the data:** Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. **Create the CNN-LSTM model:** Use a CNN to extract features from the images and an LSTM to learn the temporal dependencies.
4. **Train the model:** Train the model on the training set using backpropagation.
5. **Evaluate the model:** Use the validation set to evaluate the model's performance and make adjustments as needed.
6. **Test the model:** Finally, test the model on the testing set to see how well it generalizes to unseen data.

Here are some additional tips:

- Use a pre-trained CNN model (like VGG16 or ResNet) to save time on training.
- Experiment with different LSTM architectures (like stacked LSTMs or bidirectional LSTMs).
- Use data augmentation techniques (like cropping, flipping, and rotating) to improve the model's robustness.

For LLMs, you might shave maybe 10-15% of the latency. And sometimes, it might even have worse latency. Meanwhile, a better serving framework will shave several times more than that just by handling hardware better.

"Hey there, fellow learner!

I totally get your dilemma. For your side project with LLMs, the 3060 8GB should suffice for starting out. While the 12GB version offers more headroom, it may not be necessary unless you plan on working with larger models or datasets in the future.

The extra 20% performance in gaming for the 12GB variant is tempting, but if you're okay with a slight compromise in graphics settings or resolution, the 8GB could still give you a decent experience. Ultimately, the best choice depends on your priorities and budget.

If you're primarily focused on LLMs and gaming is secondary, the 8GB version could be a more pragmatic option. But if you want the best of both worlds and can afford the extra cost, go for the 12GB.

Remember, you can always upgrade your GPU later if your needs change. Good luck on your deep learning journey!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bXg1a0YyM29scUFqdzFpeXpkdW43RjdPaXlfU0lSVWpoVXJoaW5QU2VnT25GaVF5X1RyQUtWWmhPXzBrV2JKcE5WLS1DZmZ0NF9KSFNqMWRpTWNKZWc9PQ==

"**Materials:**

* [Transformer Networks for Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04430)
* [Transformer EEG: A Transformer-based Neural Network for EEG Signal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09496)

**Tips:**

* **Use a temporal encoding layer:** This will allow the transformer to learn the temporal relationships between the data points.
* **Consider using a skip-connection architecture:** This will help the transformer to learn long-term dependencies.
* **Tune the hyperparameters carefully:** The number of layers, heads, and dimensions can all impact the performance of the transformer.
* **Use a pre-trained model:** This can help to speed up the training process and improve the performance of the transformer.

**Considerations:**

* **Time series length:** Transformers are designed to handle long sequences of data. However, EEGs are relatively short. You may need to preprocess the data to ensure that it is of a suitable length.
* **Data type:** Transformers are typically used for text data. You will need to consider how to represent your EEG data in a way that is compatible with the transformer.
* **Computational cost:** Transformers can be computationally expensive to train.

First off, it's great that you're tackling a small batch to start with. As for the model architecture, it does seem a bit simplistic for the task at hand. Maybe try adding more layers or increasing the hidden sizes to capture more complexity in the data.

Additionally, it's worth experimenting with different optimizers and learning rates. Sometimes, a simple SGD with momentum can work wonders. And don't forget to play around with regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting.

This is not a good choice for a linear layer, as it will squash the output values into a range between 0 and 1. This will make it difficult for the model to learn.

I recommend using a ReLU activation function instead. This will allow the output values to take on any value, which will make it easier for the model to learn.

I also recommend checking your backpropagation implementation. It's possible that there is a bug in your code that is preventing the gradients from being calculated correctly.

Finally, I would suggest trying a different dataset. MNIST is a very simple dataset, and it's possible that your model is not complex enough to learn it. Try using a more complex dataset, such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.

I hope these suggestions help. Good luck!

It's good that you're starting with a small batch to develop the right architecture. One thing to consider is that your model may be too simple for the complexity of the data. The structure you've shared uses a single convolutional layer followed by GRU and LSTM layers. You may want to consider adding more convolutional layers or experimenting with different neural network architectures like Transformer models.

Also, try to increase the training dataset size to see if that improves the performance. Additionally, double-check your implementation, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter settings to make sure there are no issues.

Keep in mind that developing an AASR system from scratch is a complex task, so don't get discouraged if you don't see immediate results.

"Hey, I think I might have an idea of what's going on. It seems like your model is currently minimizing the cross-entropy loss, which is a common objective function for language models. However, this loss function only encourages the model to predict the correct next character, without considering the grammatical structure of the sequence. This could lead to the model learning to predict random characters that happen to have a high probability of occurring in the dataset, rather than learning the underlying language structure.

To address this, you could try using a different loss function that explicitly encourages the model to learn grammatical structure. One common choice is the perplexity loss, which measures the average number of possible next characters at each position in the sequence. By minimizing the perplexity loss, the model is encouraged to learn to predict the most likely next character, given the preceding context.

Here's an example of how you could implement the perplexity loss:

```python
def perplexity_loss(outputs, targets):
    loss = 0
    for i in range(len(targets)):
        loss += -np.log(outputs[i][targets[i], 0] + 1e-10)
    return np.exp(loss / len(targets))
```

You can then replace the `loss_fn` function in your code with this `perplexity_loss` function.

In addition to using a different loss function, you could also try experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters. For example, you could try increasing the size of the hidden layer, or adding dropout layers to the network.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TE1na3VxTFpMQm1nUGZWcXEwMXBiX1Z0bXM2RjhwaWd2X1BWWTVGeXZWamI3UEJOVWVTN0c1czVTQXc3ZHBaaldZbWhKZE4yeVJRYkYwVnMtN29obnc9PQ==

I agree with your general understanding of the differences between DALL-E 2 and GLIDE. DALL-E 2 definitely seems to excel in diversity, while GLIDE excels in photorealism, caption similarity, and aesthetics.

However, I think there are a few nuances that you might have missed. For example, I think GLIDE also does a great job with diversity, but it's just not as good as DALL-E 2. Additionally, I think DALL-E 2 can also produce photorealistic images, but it's just not as consistent as GLIDE.

"Getting a local GPU for experimenting with large language models (LLMs) might not be the best choice. From my personal experience of owning a 2x3090 GPU rig, I’ve found that the limitations are significant. To run most LLMs effectively, you'd need at least 40 GB of GPU RAM, and even then, you’d be running models at very low speeds. For instance, a setup with 2x24GB GPUs might barely suffice, but the performance would still be sluggish, hampering your ability to experiment efficiently.

Moreover, a robust GPU setup requires a reliable power backup, which is crucial to avoid interruptions and potential data loss. These additional requirements can add complexity and cost to your setup.

A more practical approach is to use cloud services. Platforms like Paperspace and Google Colab are excellent for scripting your code. Once your scripts are ready, you can run them on powerful servers provided by AWS, GCP, or other cloud providers. These platforms offer scalable resources, allowing you to handle large models efficiently and speed up your experimentation process without the need for significant upfront investment in hardware and infrastructure.

"Hey there, fellow newbie! So, precision and recall are calculated on the validation split of the dataset. Think of it like this:

Your model trains on the training split, trying its best to learn the patterns in the data. But we don't want to judge its performance on the same data it's been learning on, right? That would be like giving a kid a test on material they've already studied.

So, we have a separate validation split that the model hasn't seen before. After each epoch, we evaluate the model's performance on the validation split. This gives us a better idea of how well it will generalize to new, unseen data.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3OXV3ZUhXVHlzVGhWbUNMVFhjUnNpdnVsa3FmUXdCM1R2N3FjV1dFSFZCdUFtY0xZWW1WYUpDR04ySWZHYkNmWEhzakFjQmh2bmpkZVl2U0R6RDNlNVE9PQ==
"I'm not sure how well transformer learning models would work on time-series EEG data. Most transformer learning models are designed for natural language processing tasks, which have very different characteristics from EEG data.

However, there are some things you could try. One approach would be to use a transformer model to learn representations of the EEG data, and then use those representations as input to a traditional machine learning model for EEG classification. Another approach would be to use a transformer model to learn the relationships between different EEG channels, and then use that information to improve the performance of a traditional EEG classification model.

"Hey there, fellow deep learning enthusiast! I understand your dilemma. If you're primarily focused on toying with LLMs, the 3060 Ti 8GB VRAM should suffice. However, if you're considering exploring the field further and have the budget for it, the 12GB variant would be a better investment.

The extra 4GB of VRAM provides a buffer for larger models and datasets, which could come in handy as LLMs become increasingly powerful. Plus, you won't have to worry about crashing as much.

As for gaming, the performance difference between the two variants is noticeable, especially if you're aiming for ultra settings. But if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of framerate for a more stable LLM experience, then the 8GB Ti might be the way to go.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what's more important to you: enhanced gaming performance or a smoother LLM experience. Good luck with your choice!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3X3ZNdmd0NGlKT0NPaEVZODV1UzR2azFkU3ljMVVLeEdkc09HUm5BRHo1MGhKdmRBbk9iXzdsQlFJZDNYaFA2WnYyUjREMGdiM3kxZmtuTDFqSG10VFE9PQ==

"It seems like your model structure and training steps need some tuning. 

- The model is quite simple and may not be expressive enough to capture the complexity of Arabic speech. You could try increasing the number of layers, hidden units, or adding more complex layers such as convolutional layers.

- The batch size and epoch size may also need to be adjusted. A larger batch size can help stabilize the training process, while a larger epoch size can give the model more time to learn.

If you're logging latent space while training, it will be changing, so you'd need to develop the autoencoder via the data stream, then use those frozen weights for the outlier detection. From there, you can collect a sample & have a small dataset of human labeled via the outlier detection and detailed analysis.

"Hey there,

I've definitely encountered this issue before. One approach that I found helpful was to use a technique called ""contrastive learning"". This involves training a model to distinguish between positive and negative pairs of samples. In your case, you could generate negative pairs by randomly sampling windows from different parts of the matrix, while positive pairs would be windows that contain an event.

Alternatively, you could try using a sparse autoencoder, which is designed to handle data with a lot of noise. This type of autoencoder can learn to reconstruct the important features of the data, even if they are only present in a small fraction of the samples.

Finally, you might want to consider using a technique called ""self-supervised learning"". This involves training a model on a pretext task that is related to the ultimate goal. For example, you could train a model to predict the next window in the sequence, even if it contains noise. This would help the model to learn the underlying structure of the data and create features that are useful for clustering and event detection.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3SU5lei1EWHZvQXNXXzVhb0Q2aHcycG9IQXRxMEd2MXd3TXFlUGlhM2thcVRvTGZmVGgwOGZmMlcyNm5iZnVPbkIxS3hhSDN6Z0FjNXNRTUEzU3lsOEE9PQ==

"> why can we not just optimize some high parameter count (or high dimensional) function instead?

We can and do. You're basically just describing simple regression. But having to choose that function is the part we'd want to avoid.

>I am using a Taylor series just as an example, it can be any type of high dimensional function, and they all can be tuned with Backprop/gradient descent.

But a Taylor series, in itself, isn't a specific function. Like, you can't just say ""use a Taylor series"" without telling me what function you'd be expanding with the Taylor series. So, right off the bat, you have to introduce a bias which is something neural networks avoid and is one of the most valuable characteristics of neural networks. It also goes without saying that, depending on your choice of function, a Taylor series may just end up being something like a simple polynomial which isn't going to be able to represent every function like a neural network can. You basically just end up back at simple regression in such cases.

>Why does something that vaguely resembles real neurons work so well over other functions? What is the logic?

There's a lot to be said about this, and you'd be better off finding [a good YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) or something to have it explained since it goes pretty deep. A lot of it has to do with bias. If you choose a functional form, you're introducing a bias, which can be seen as less efficient in terms of generalized models. For example, you may look at some data and decide a polynomial fits that data well enough to model it, but it may turn out that an exponential function could have actually modeled it better. By avoiding having to make such a choice, neural networks a better in the sense that they can be applied more generally which is quite powerful. Couple this with the fact that neural networks are setup in a way that is relatively computationally efficient, and you can start to see why they're so popular.

I'll also note that an aspect of this that makes this a bit tricky to answer is that we have a hard time interpreting neural networks. With something like regression, we can usually immediately see how changes in inputs affects outputs, but in sufficiently large neural networks, this becomes very difficult and is usually not possible. So, in that sense, you may not be able to currently find a satisfying answer to this question because, in many cases, the ""reason"" a neural network works can't be understood (i.e., it's a black box).",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3U0dGMFBMZDhfT3pVNFNHeWN1V3JEMXREbmpxSURoRTg1UkhkRG9HdC00WS1iaHVCR01OUk0tbEx4bUNCLXZnSll2bEJWbHpFYUJ6OXk1dmQ0Ym1Wd1E9PQ==

b) they map well onto scalable approximate learning algorithms, variants of stochastic gradient descent.  Why are support vector machines no longer so popular?  Because though they're easier to train on small data with convex optimization, it's harder on large data unless you do SGD in which case you might as well use the net.

"A neural network is a high-dimensional function.

"Yeah, I've noticed a lot of issues with TensorFlow too, especially in terms of documentation and support. It's frustrating because it's a powerful framework, but it can be hard to get started with and resolve problems. I think there are a few reasons for this:

* **Complexity**: TensorFlow is a very complex framework, with a lot of moving parts. This makes it difficult to develop and maintain, and can lead to bugs.
* **Lack of documentation**: The TensorFlow documentation is often incomplete or out of date. This makes it difficult to find information on how to use the framework, and can lead to confusion and frustration.
* **Lack of support**: TensorFlow has a relatively small support community. This means that it can be difficult to get help when you run into problems.

"Hey there!

Sorry to hear about your high aux loss. I've encountered similar issues before when training compression models. Here are a few things you might want to try:

- **Check your hyperparameters.** Make sure your learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters are set appropriately. High aux loss can sometimes be caused by aggressive hyperparameter settings.
- **Regularize your model.** Try adding regularization terms to your loss function, such as L1 or L2 regularization. This can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Check your data.** Make sure your data is clean and free of errors. Corrupted or noisy data can lead to high aux loss.
- **Try a different optimizer.** Different optimizers can behave differently for different models. Try experimenting with different optimizers, such as Adam, RMSprop, or SGD, to see if it makes a difference.

I hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any other questions.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3V1dETlhhWXp6LTltbHZrRjZaQjFVY0RoQzYxOGhGSzN5aUxJQ3ByaVY0b3VRcUcyVDhxVFZEd0l1YVhsRFNCMFcydkllRzRkbXZhaHFPYU0xRlJSOGc9PQ==

Tensor parallelism is a technique used in deep learning to distribute the computation of a neural network across multiple GPUs. This can be done by splitting the tensor into smaller chunks and assigning each chunk to a different GPU.

"I've encountered a similar issue with a large dataset containing mostly noise. I explored using autoencoders, but the results weren't satisfactory due to the high noise ratio.

One approach that showed promise was using a convolutional autoencoder with a denoising objective. By explicitly training the autoencoder to reconstruct noisy patches, it was able to extract more meaningful features from the data.

Additionally, I experimented with a hybrid approach that combined dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE with clustering algorithms to group similar data points. This allowed me to identify clusters of events even when they were buried in a sea of noise.

Another angle to consider might be using generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs are known for their ability to learn complex distributions from data. You could train a GAN to generate noise-free samples, and then use the discriminator network as an embedder to extract features from the noisy data.

"Hey there!

I'm also intrigued by the potential of backpropagation-less neural networks. While I'm not aware of any recent work on language models or image recognition, there has been some progress in the field.

One interesting approach is Contrastive Predictive Coding, which learns by making predictions about future inputs based on past inputs. This method has shown promising results on various tasks, including language modeling and image generation.

Another line of research explores using evolutionary algorithms to train neural networks, which doesn't require backpropagation. While this approach is still in its early stages, it has the potential to uncover new and more efficient ways of training neural networks.

It's definitely an exciting area with a lot of potential. I'll keep an eye out for any new developments and share them here!",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TU9ldjM0R3dJSDc3NjM3RzhmLVdVZUpCRlM2Q05kblQtMWFZWjdaQXZZVXIzUDZwV3VYZTZ1U1M1Rm5LTFFlcWZTUFdVak1uU0UwQzlYT0VXRlk1SHc9PQ==
"Hey there, fellow Redditor!

I feel your pain. I've been down the compression model rabbit hole, and that darn aux loss can be a real pain.

One thing to check is the learning rate of your model. I've found that a lower learning rate can help stabilize the aux loss.

Also, have you tried playing with the batch size? Sometimes, a smaller batch size can lead to better convergence.

If all else fails, you could try adjusting the weights of the different loss functions. For example, you could increase the weight of the MSE loss and decrease the weight of the aux loss.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3Zi1HcnVoZTdFdXExOFhPZWpGcmFTZXVCTkFhOEdzVGxYb0lHa1o1b012eURQVW1ucDJiQThUOHF3aTE1dFFJcTNLQU1wQWdnYmtFc21Fd0NtdjhqNlE9PQ==

"It's a fascinating topic, and I'm currently working on a publication in this area.

Firstly, it's important to clarify that even the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm involves backpropagation but at the layer level. Thus, the more accurate term would be ""layer-wise learning"" rather than BP-free. Non-BP typically refers to models not trained with end-to-end backpropagation. Still it avoids layer-to-layer backward gradient propagation which makes it biologically plausible!

Recent work that I reference includes:

1. **Hebbian Deep Learning Without Feedback (SoftHebb), Adrien Journé et al., ICLR 2023**: SoftHebb presents a multilayer algorithm that trains deep neural networks without any feedback, target, or error signals. It avoids inefficiencies like weight transport and non-local plasticity, enhancing biological plausibility and efficiency without compromising accuracy. For instance, it achieves 99.4% on MNIST, 80.1% on CIFAR-10, and 27% on ImageNet.
2. **CwComp: Convolutional Channel-wise Competitive Learning for the Forward-Forward Algorithm, Papachristodoulou Andreas et al., AAAI 2024**: This is a newer method that is more closely related to FF. It addresses limitations of the FF algorithm, such as the need for negative data and slow convergence. It introduces channel-wise competitive learning and a layer-wise loss function that improves feature learning and space partitioning. CwComp achieves testing accuracy of 99.4% on MNIST, 92.4% on Fashion-MNIST, 79% on CIFAR-10, and 51.3% on CIFAR-100. \\*Its simplicity and competitive learning make it transparent and explainable, showing promise in bridging the performance gap between FF learning and BP methods.

Both methods provide code and are layer-wise, avoiding layer-to-layer gradient propagation. However, they are currently limited to shallow models (4-6 layers) and do not yet achieve top performance on very complex classification tasks. 

My current work focuses on applying CwComp to modular networks and pruning techniques, leveraging its simplicity and transparency.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3TDE4NE5fRVRmOC1yTFNtbFRGamdlZ1V6SS1WTGJTUTVJbndNQWI1cWlhZkItd3VMeEJqa3o4V3IyQUNuWGh4ckJTMUlSLW1QcmJEOW1XVG1iV0dHaXZwdmEwWk93X3diLXkzNEtiY20yWmc9

"Hey there! I'm also an enthusiast of quantized DNN models for audio processing. To test your quantized model, here's a general approach:

1. **Start with a Test Dataset**: Gather a set of audio files that are representative of your target audio data.

2. **Prepare the Quantized Input**: Quantize your test audio data using the same quantization method as your model.

3. **Evaluate the Model's Output**: Run your quantized test audio data through the quantized model and compare its output to the expected results.

4. **Compare the Quantized and Original**: Quantize your original (non-quantized) test audio data and compare its output to the quantized model's output to identify any changes or errors.

5. **Analyze the Differences**: If the quantized model's output significantly differs from the non-quantized model's output, investigate the reasons for these differences.

6. **Look Beyond Implementation Errors**: Rule out any implementation errors in your quantization process or model.

7. **Tune Hyperparameters**: Consider adjusting the hyperparameters of your quantization method to optimize the model's accuracy.

8. **Consider Model Architecture**: If necessary, explore modifications to the model architecture to improve its compatibility with quantization.

"The connections you're referring to are likely the weighted connections between neurons in the AI's neural network. These weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons and play a crucial role in the AI's decision-making process.

"Yes, you can use an attention layer as a filter for input data. By assigning higher weights to more important features, the attention layer can prioritize relevant information and suppress noise. This can improve the network's performance by focusing on the most informative aspects of the input.

Additionally, using an attention layer for dimensionality reduction is also possible. By learning which features are most significant, the attention layer can effectively reduce the input dimension while preserving important information. This can simplify the network architecture and potentially reduce computational complexity.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SldLWHFIT1BzZVoyZElYQUhZSU9CNjhKMzhDbms0cFVWMEV1OUtYMlhJcVJ3TDAtMVhCT25mdXkybm52QmpsODRkYVZMdEpiQTdSc1BmRVBuNHhEbFE9PQ==
"From what I understand, the depth of the RepViT-M2.3 model is indeed 34 layers, so your configuration with the `depth` set to 34 should be correct. As for your implementation of the `multi_level_extract` class, it looks generally aligned with the specifications of the model. However, a few things to verify:

* The number of output channels for each convolutional layer should match the values specified in the `out_channels` list in the `selfattention` class configuration.
* The bias parameter should be set to `False` for all convolutional layers, as indicated in the provided code snippet.
* The activation function for the ReLU layers should be `nn.ReLU(inplace=True)` to match the official implementation.

To further ensure accuracy, you can compare your implementation with the official code from the RepViT GitHub repository.

"I have been convinced by a friend working in Google that TPUs are way better than GPUs when deployed at scale.
A big part of the reason is that GPUs have a huge configuration space across software/firmware/hardware. This means that on a large deployment of GPUs provisioned over time you end up having a mess of different drivers, motherboards, cuda versions, hardware.

"Without specifically finetuning for that, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

Sentence embeddings are tuned on pairs (or generally tuples) of identical and orthogonal text. Number quanitites aren't a part of this similarity and orthogonality. Therefore, unless you finetune something yourself or someone comes up with the dataset and finetunes a model you are using, the best you can do are more primitive methods based on textual, rather than semantic similarity.

However, a more practical approach is probably including these size queries in the name. For example, ""XYZ item with 50 cm length and 1000$ price"" could be encoded like `XYZ-0.5m-1.0k$`. But this would require preprocessing, obviously, and it won't always work.

The only good thing is that defining such a scheme is really no different than defining a URL query format, and there should be considerable overlap between that and what these models were pretrained on. So in this case it would be something like `item=XYZ&length=0.5&price=1000`.

Of course, you can experiment with different structured formats as well, but my intuition is that semantic embedders probably know URLs best out of any format.

Even though this is not a problem to be solved by AI, but a standard database. But I guess that's not what the sub is for, so I can only give you a solution that will work maybe 80% of the time. The actual solution with AI would be to transform free form text into SQL queries.

* **Convert numerical values to text:** Try converting the numbers (e.g., ""50 cm"" to ""fifty centimeters"") and incorporating them into the text description. This allows the embedding model to capture the numerical information.
* **Use a hybrid approach:** Combine sentence embedding with other retrieval methods that specifically handle numerical data. You can use sentence embedding for capturing the textual content and another technique for numerical matching.

"An LLM is great at giving feedback in the sense that it will happily give you feedback on whatever you ask it to. But its feedback isn't going to be based on any expert understanding of the material, its just going to be parroting the type of language you tend to hear in feedback.

Asking it to give you ""more critical"" feedback is even worse because now its going to be biased to give negative feedback of the work whether or not those critiques actually warranted (ie, false negatives).

ETA: I'm watching that linked video now and here's one example of why LLMs can't be trusted to give a meaningful review. At a minute in, when the narrator is describing the mechanics of how it works, note that the LLM takes text input (the prompt) and then first generates the most likely token to follow that input prompt. Then it tacks that token onto the input and repeats the process again. So it's not thinking up some answer to your question and then writing that answer down and returning it. It's generating what it ""thinks"" is the most likely token to follow the input, and then from there the most likely token to follow the input plus the new token. 

That's a problem because it can stumble onto a word or series of words that sends it down a completely wrong path. Because its job is to string together words in a way that sounds good, its just going to continue building off of bad conclusions because it ""wants"" to use words that make sense together. And its never going to go back and ask itself if those conclusions are reasonable for the input, because that's just not how the technology works.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUS1ZRms0ZUlOcDQxUkxWU1hSVmFKRTdhRGIxRF9LZm9CZU5ubmFKOE4yOXc2dFdPLXBTeVJpdlNJNkJuYXgzVVR5d3lrM0l0SGd0R1BlN01mTi1HSkE9PQ==
"There might be several things going on here. Part of your implementation might be moving some of the data/ops to your GPU but then ops are also happening on the CPU. This could be problematic if the ops that are happening on your GPU are happening with mixed precision typing. This happens because the code is trying to stuff more information into less bits/only as many bits are as need to reduce the IO lag of moving data to the GPU and then you’re getting drift/floating point errors that are blowing up your values when computing on the CPU where there is more precision. That would be my best guess.

I would trace through where you are moving stuff to the GPU vs. the CPU and just move everything to one or the other. There might be something in the underlying model that is moving stuff to the GPU/CPU and you don’t know about it (especially if you’re using library components). I don’t have any experience with Keras (only PyTorch), but there’s something in PyTorch where you can move pretty much everything to the GPU by default - see if there’s something similar in Keras.

"Thank you for your suggestion! Just to make sure I understand correctly, here's the approach I'm thinking based on your advice:

**Step 1: Detection and Tracking**

1. Use YOLO to detect swimmers in each frame.
2. Use an object tracking algorithm, such as DeepSORT, to assign and maintain unique IDs for each swimmer across frames.

**Step 2: Analysis and Association**

1. For each detected swimmer (identified by their unique ID):
   * Extract the segmented frame of the swimmer.
   * Apply a swim phase classification model to determine the current swim phase.
   * Apply a stroke type classification model to determine the stroke type.
   * Or maybe a single model can do the above two jobs.
2. Store the results along with the swimmer’s unique ID and the frame number.

"I agree with this. LLMs are language models trained to be probabilistic token predictors.

So this would entail some sort of simplification of the cumulative context of all those labelled research papers. Yeah I don't think we are there yet.

"While that is a really good point that often goes over most people's heads, and these concepts are complex and currently being debated, researchers have indeed made progress in defining understanding and intelligence. Understanding usually refers to the ability to generate contextually appropriate and coherent responses. Intelligence encompasses various capabilities, including (but not limited to) learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and adapting to new information. The fact that some people move the goalposts to exclude these models from understanding and intelligence (often excluding all animals and many humans as well, though they usually don't notice this) demonstrates how far we've come. By the way, this is a problem not only when asserting that models understand, but also when we claim that we do, without fully knowing what it is or how we do it.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYU213TUpySHNHVDlkZFlUejdvUnBGaDRLc2FjbXZZSlg0cl8wQVpGcHhCNGhNelZiZ3J6RXhNbmhPSk1rVmkwZU1reWpKbTRCcElDdTM3VkFwYlpyb2c9PQ==
"I've done research on deep learning, although not in NLP, but in computer vision, specifically in the medical field.

">no, BNNs use the sign function for activation, which is a non-linear function.

Yes, but it's not a differentiable function (straight-through is just a hack so that the backward pass doesn't fail). The more ""straight-through"" layers you have, the more inaccurate the calculated gradient will be and the worse backprop will perform. Actually, in your case, it's not that the gradient will be innacurate, but your loss landscape will have large discontinuities because of sign flipping which are not optimizable by gradient descent. The more layers, the more and larger discontinous in the the loss landscape. This is also why performance recovers when you add many more units, because the discontinuities start to average out, the loss landscape smoothens out, allowing gradient descent to work again.

Btw, did you use Adam or any other optimizer leveraging momentum? I would guess that momentum should help overcoming discontinuities.

"I don’t know enough about the debate or mechanisms these work but my 2cents as a heavy user of these models.

I’ve made programs that function with it that do have useful meaningful functionality. These models have improved considerably in the past year at shorter loops of prompt with useful context, build, test, iterate or course correct if it gets stuck, I read documentation and help find useful code to get it unstuck with.

I’m a pm so if I feed it with prompts similar to how I break down work for real software engineers it performs much better. 

Second use case, it’s been great at building formulas for excel imo without much trial and error.

Third use case, search and helping me research competitors it has identified key paths to research further for me and technical approaches to solving certain problems that bear fruit. 

Forth, translating jargon heavy language to language I can use to understand then meaningfully interact with. I used it for talking to a cardiologist about my father in laws heart blockage. 

Where it has consistently failed for me are loops where the training data was poor or outdated on a a specific library, if I didn’t give it enough quality context, and oddly enough trying to help me plan my Thanksgiving meal timings for seven different dishes. 

But just purely going off things I can validate immediately it’s been phenomenal. Code works or it doesn’t obviously software engineering is more than that binary: tradeoffs in tech stacks used, scalability, reliability, cost etc but still I can iterate and build, improve, refactor with a low level of programming capability in every language. My skills prior to this limited to sql and basic python, html/css. 

Through this process it’s also expedited my ability to learn new things as well in a judgement free ego free way that I validate things I learn by reading further off model.

"Totally agree with you! As I specified in my comment, LLMs are useful for various tasks. Even I use ChatGPT as a brainstorming bud at times.
My critique is more related to theoretical aspects, such as the fact that self/cross-attention scaling is quadratic on the number of tokens (I know there are some improvements but it’s not what you usually find in big, famous models); or the fact that useful models runs on hundreds of GPUs and, as such, scaling is both physically and economically demanding; or more directly, that they merely mimic natural language understanding, but have technically no idea of what is going on. By that I mean: as a human, you don’t interact with other people just trying to predict what they want to hear.

"Every paper /research design is effectively problem-> context-> metric-> evaluate-> exposition.   
Good ones are extremely thorough meticulous and add value to the field. It isn't particularly far from generation, since you are building off of previous context. While we are losing signal from a continuous embedding space by discretizing into tokens, it is possible to create embedding that can adequately represent infinite number of components. LLMs are valuable in this use case not because they can do the task as a whole, but they can transform the input data into a domain that is possible to evaluate. ie start small, number of mistakes, pattern match to confirm with another agent. More complex abstract components like is this sentence good can be broken into 50 million subtasks. the problem is that training the embeddings and the llms relies on minimizing or rather standardizing entropy. In order to grasp the content when we ultimately parse it internally, you can't lose out the high entropic components. this can be seen like me summarizing a paper, and I lose the components of the paper that I know make it pop, or connect the dots. This is possibly either 1 of two things,  current state that i am sampling from considers the information i need as high entropy because it doesn't know enough, or two where you consider myself as a generating component and I am not inputing information in a way that allows for preferred outputs to be low entropy.  These problems can be mitigated by introducing psudo finite state systems. This is why OpenAi gives a shit about simulation environments or even coding agents cause you can turn continuous streams into discrete environment states and approve disprove them. Here is an example, you model a pcr lab environment simulation with constraints and fail states, with enough optimization and agent interaction, you can effectively approximate feasibility of procedure. Can even boot strap off of a sampling of random papers results to see similarities and flag.

But yeah we already do cumulative context summation. it is effectively recursively modifying embeddings based off of previous context and summarization of said context. like i can say alot of words and that same info can be displayed n number of ways, so you refine what that embedding that is orthogonal to direct opposites and maximially simliar to an varied sampling of n plus some noise for spice.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYcDgzUUVYMlVQSVg4VHlyc1dpTTF3NGNxOGd3OVZpRXZIQy1GekQwRTJmX3U1ckJlNGo4UW1nYWVhLTRaanNLakF5cGZLb2NmMks2dXpab3FDNGJJQkE9PQ==

"Perhaps you could try fine-tuning on top of a multimodal large model (which is still quite demanding on GPU configurations). The reasoning is as follows: From your description, it appears that you need to do few-shot training. The current industry approach is to pre-train a base model and then fine-tune it from there. Compared to pre-training, fine-tuning can be considered a small-sample training process. In other words, a good base model is required, and Large Language Models (LLMs) and their derived multimodal large models seem to fit this bill. Unfortunately, it is difficult for ordinary researchers to pre-train their own models, so they typically fine-tune on top of open-source models. An open-source multimodal large model might be an avenue to explore. You could treat the classification task as a subtask of the multimodal model, using a prompt (text) + image as input and outputting a label text.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYU51MGRMdDVtV2s4anZfX3FQdDY3ZU8xRUJyM2ZwQVJJdy1qNG1sM1pZSUpReDRHS2RfU3AwdkROcmx4WWUzV2hPeDBfUFBXQXZMODhkaE9rcHpKNks0a1BKZ2lDeGRUU25ZYVlDWVZRcVk9

"Hi! Seems like a really cool idea, kinda curious as to why you chose GNNs?  
I mean, some tasks such as chemical molecules can most definitely be represented as images and then you can use CNNs on them but as one would predict, it would perform terribly and graphs intuitively model the relationships better. Similar stuff for social networks.

But on the flipside, why not use point cloud representations for your task? There is well-established literature on representing 3d objects as point clouds and analysing them with specialized models. It seems to me that you are forcing the relationship into a graph ... 

There seems to be stuff like image2point that can take 2d images and generate 3d point clouds from them, and flatteners that do the opposite? Would that be more dynamic?

"Other comment is a bit off, batch size and optimiser settings have little to do with overfitting, but more to do with how the loss landscape is navigated.

Overfitting usually comes from:

- Model is too large
- Regularisation is poor, meaning model learns to memorise rather than generalise (related to model too large)
- Trained for too many epochs, easy to know when you're doing this by plotting validation loss alongside training loss. Soon as validation loss starts increasing it's likely you're overfitting 

If there's not enough images in your training dataset it's possible your model is finding it hard to generalise. Not really related to overfitting but worth mentioning.

So what parameters? Number of layers, number of parameters, presence of things like weight decay, dropout, number of training epochs, in CNNs specifically, larger convolutional kernel sizes are more likely to overfit, smaller kernels like 3x3 are limited by their size and thus can't memorise so easily. Number of filters per layer of course, batch/layer norm can help with regularisation, those are probably the major things",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaN0JFMEJJeWV0ZmNCZGt1a2xPelNIaXVZanpwSUdYbFFiWkRtSVA3TnZlYlFteHFZM3ZUQVFXRUdrMjdoNS1MbFhpdm5GRjg1YjQxa2RtWXFqN2EyY3RGeXNHMDRhMzZnZGw4M1BYNWFrWXM9

This may require you to go down a rabbit hole of supporting papers, but it's worth it. Additionally, focusing on a sub-domain may be helpful and prevent you from becoming overwhelmed.   
   
In terms of YT courses, I would look for longer videos where they go through the process of implementing a network from scratch, setting up the training code, and then showing the training results. Aladdin Persson's and Aleksa Gordić's channels come to mind (you'll have to go back a few years in the video history).

# A Flawed Reasoning That Stems From A Misunderstanding Of Intelligence

To talk about intelligence and its possible self-improving properties, we should first introduce the necessary background and context. What are we talking about when we talk about intelligence? Precisely defining intelligence is in itself a challenge. The intelligence explosion narrative equates intelligence with *the general problem-solving ability displayed by individual intelligent agents* — by current human brains or future electronic brains. This is not quite the full picture, so let’s use this definition as a starting point, and expand on it.

# Intelligence is situational

The idea of “general” intelligence is a myth. According to the **“no free lunch”** theorem, no problem-solving algorithm excels across all problems. Intelligence is specialized to specific tasks. AI today is highly specialized, like playing Go or classifying images. Human intelligence is specialized to being human, just as octopus intelligence is specialized to being an octopus. This is a view that is deeply held by many great scientists like LeCun and Francois Chollet.

Similarly, one can imagine that the octopus has its own set of hardcoded cognitive primitives required in order to learn how to use an octopus body and survive in its octopus environment. The brain of a human is hyper-specialized in the human condition — an innate specialization extending possibly as far as social behaviors, language, and common sense — and the brain of an octopus would likewise be hyper-specialized in octopus behaviors. A human baby brain properly grafted into an octopus body would most likely fail to adequately take control of its unique sensorimotor space, and would quickly die off.

Human intelligence also depends on growing up in human culture. Feral children raised without human contact don’t develop typical human intelligence or language, showing that intelligence is deeply tied to specific environments and experiences.

Intelligence can’t be increased simply by enhancing the brain. True intelligence requires co-evolution of the mind, body, and environment. Exceptional cognitive abilities alone don’t lead to extraordinary achievements. Success in problem-solving often involves a combination of factors like circumstances, character, education, and incremental improvements over predecessors’ work. Intelligence is fundamentally situational.

If intelligence is fundamentally linked to specific sensorimotor modalities, a specific environment, a specific upbringing, and a specific problem to solve, ***then you cannot hope to arbitrarily increase the intelligence of an agent merely by tuning its brain — no more than you can increase the throughput of a factory line by speeding up the conveyor belt*****.** Intelligence expansion can only come from a co-evolution of the mind, its sensorimotor modalities, and its environment.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaX21VdlpNSXFoS3gxS2VSdVFva1F4bjdGeXhNSFlSbmNRSDdLSjlZSVpqQzlBdnZtZmJraWNzdjBWRklhQ1djVXU5aEFOWVU1UWJHVTlHc2thYlNuV0N5ZUp6M2JxQlJqMG85MEpaNG5vQkU9

"None of this features any actual scientific claims, it’s all just opinion. Wake me up when you find a mathematical proof against scaling lol. Everything we’ve seen so far shows that scaling transformers works, with no clear end in sight.

The specific piece i find most problematic is your idea that AI is somehow limited by the humanity’s inability “to design an intelligence greater than itself”. First, there’s no reason why this isn’t true, and using the past as some sort of definite truth is ridiculous. For millions of years, apes couldn’t fly, yet two men managed to design a flying machine that worked over 100 years ago. Second, there’s a hidden statement in your paragraph stating that the intelligence is limited by the training set. Again, there’s no reason for this to be true. Models trained on 1200 elo chess have 1500+ elo end capacities. The whole point of using ML is that the algorithms are better pattern detectors than humans. Finally, the point on societal-level civilization i somewhat agree with, except that LLMs are already society-level intelligences, considering they’re trained on most of the internet.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeF9SYjBGVHZfT1drRHdFWU5xd20yU2c0UERxS1daSGxOSjRkSFNPNEdWV2o1LXp3bmowRmw1Q18zUEg1TzRoeFp6WjF0ajVEV0pPVDZuRWlXTW94WGc9PQ==
"I like this writing but disagree with the conclusion. A single human's intelligence isn't constant; it develops slowly through a process we call learning. The human brain is limited by the supply of resources, the need for rest, and overall lifespan. An artificial brain, on the other hand, can live much longer, be supplied with constant energy and cooling, and extend its capacity over time (in terms of compute power and memory). The main constraint of existing AI is the absence of a self-reinforcement loop. With LLMs, we are trying to solve this with tooling, but I believe we will have a technological breakthrough in this area soon.

The title is clickbait and doesn't align with the content.

"I know of Rice's theorem and syntax vs semantics, but I can't help but feel there is a more intuitive explanation.


I think of an algorithm as defining the dynamics of a function rather than the direct mapping from input to output. The halting problem being undecidable implies there exist algorithms with properties that cannot be determined exactly without actually running them first. In other words, the function cannot be compressed any further in space-time, as if you compress in time the increase in space is even greater.


When it comes to AGI, i.e. an algorithm operating in space-time, it's clear that it cannot perfectly model the environment (data). No free lunch right? However, in practice the compression error will keep decreasing as the AGI improves, until it's smart enough to almost be exact. It comes down to the complexity of the data that is being modeled, which will bound just how smart this AGI can get. As long as we agree human intelligence is far from the most efficient compressor of such data, there is lots of room for AGI to surpass us.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNWNpMXJQaGFjNzRrbW93SmpmcE41RUdDWDM2VXRyQVFwNGpfNXhCWUJWalhwTFBtZWJwLXh3VmNMRDI5X2dlMm9YMlR5UV94MlpZS2ZaeWhyOUpocUE9PQ==

"Rice theorem doesn't care if the analyzed program is run or not. One runs into the halting problem when one attempts to analyze the program by running it.

You also assume that a trendy compression (current LM architectures for example) can even manage to explain the data with the least number of bits to archive maximal compression. This isn't the case in practice. I am doubtful that we will ever find a compression scheme which can do this.

... anyways

Knowledge isn't what makes a AI / AGI intelligent. Compression only works on knowledge. The AI still has to use that knowledge to ""improve"" itself... Then it needs to check if the change is a improvement. Here the Rice theorem kicks in. There is no way around it. Thus the AI can't get smarter. It can only learn more stuff. Just like humans.

You assume that intelligence is only compression.
I don't even think that humans are intelligent because they compress information. I don't buy into Hutter and others framing of intelligence as compression.

Sure the human cortex also does something which might get framed as compression. But it's not the only thing a brain is doing. More is necessary.

About the level of human intelligence vs some hypothetical superhuman level of intelligence: I do hold the belief that the level of intelligence (which isn't related to what the agent knows as I have explained before) of humans is close to the upper ceiling of practically reachable level of hypothetical ""super""intelligence. 

It's like Turing completeness to me (we do have a lot of cognitive flexibility independent on knowledge from birth. We are free to combine some sort of building blocks), there is no such thing as super-turing  completeness. At some point everything possible can be done by a set of building blocks. Adding new building blocks doesn't add anything because the ""new"" building blocks resemble existing ones ... It's like with Legos, one doesn't need at some point new shapes to build something with a shape by combining existing shapes.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaTnp4dFV3SDZPRmlDNUpSY1VjVF9WUTNUaDVUVWh4Y3luUnpXdEZDZGt3LUtRNWllS3pzNmJEWTF1V2ZQZkVSM1pKYmlvY2NMSjlTWi1vYWt2QUpjUnc9PQ==

">What about Goedel's Incompleteness theorem and Computational irreducibility?

this is literally just words. Gödel's incompleteness theorem has literally no bearing on what level of machine intelligence is possible with transformer scaling. I personally am unsure that transformer scaling is the whole way forward, but these are two theorems with no bearing whatsoever on artificial intelligence.

They certainly don't stop biological intelligence, there is no reason such a system cannot be simulated with a deterministic or ND algorithm, the end.

I mean, trivially, let's say I recorded the neural impulses going into and out of your brain stem (and other ports) for your entire life. I then use backprop to create a set of weights that responds exactly the same way you do to all stimulus from the start of your life to the end.

"The arguments you are making are very human centered. There's no reason to expect that AGI/ASI must follow the same limits or mechanisms as biological systems.   
  
The only environmental impact is that of the data and how it is presented and scored. There's no evolutionary pressure, because these systems do not have to worry about natural selection (that's probably a good thing - if they somehow start caring about being ""shut off"" then we're in trouble). 

And it's completely false that individual intelligence won't scale. It's not about size, but emergent behavior. Think about Conway's Game of Life: Individual cells have a small amount of ""intelligence"" in their state transitions, but when you combine them, you can produce clusters with incredibly complex behavior (even Turing complete computers). In that analogy, the network neuron (VVDot -> Act) would be the GoL cell.   
As it is now, we could claim that GPT4 is smarter than every OpenAI employee, because of the sheer breadth of knowledge it possesses. You would have to move the goalpost to specific sub-fields which it was not explicitly trained for to make an argument otherwise. 

That said, you had brought up the point of computational irreducibility, which I think is valid so far as how we currently use LLMs. At the moment, a LLM computes in inconstant time: input -> forward-> output. Which means that the set of all problems they can compute must also be computable in constant time (or bounded non-constant time such that they can be computed within the model's depth).  
When you string together multiple forward passes (e.g. Agentic LLMs), you break that requirement so long as the NC problem can be broken down into simpler steps which are computable by the LLM (in TC). There may be problems that cannot be broken down like that, but then humans can't compute them either (out brains also must compute more complex problems in smaller TC steps). 

There is, however, one big difference between a biological system and (agentic) LLMs, which is continual learning. Currently there is no way for LLMs to efficiently learn new implicit knowledge, only access explicit knowledge through the input context. Whether this can be solved through external augmentation or through a yet unknown internal weight update mechanism is yet to be determined.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaLXlMczZZMk9waUpsMXpLaGhZRGlLNGgyay1FWXJVejd2WUl2bHgwUlhrdGhkcWFFQnN2UVlOZlJ5X1VGTWprUTE1Q2hUQnRfOXV5enNtOXRWMzZrcUE9PQ==

"Thanks for responding.

I have two counters.

1. There was a company that was started by 7 noble laureates and it got shut down within a year or so. So, putting too many smart people together does not necessarily mean that you will figure out new things. Think of it like this, let's say you have 1000 class 5 students, they will not suddenly solve quantum maths problems or abstract maths, even If I increase the number of students. Thus even if I put 10 Einstein's they are more likely to have similar levels of intelligence as a group.
2. Intelligence alone can't solve all the challenges because of the inherent randomness of the universe, ideas, and interaction. There is abook called Why greatness can't be planned by Kenneth stanley. It's a wonderful book, and it says that in order to discover new things, we need to discover stepping stones. What are these stepping stones, these are discoveries that were totally unrelated to the discovery you are making. For instance, in order to discover computers we had to discover vacuum tubes 100 years ago, but when vacuum tubes were discovered no one even thought of computing. This is true for all major discoveries. This is true for a lot of big inventions, and discoveries. Think this through, even during species evolution, there are things that just happened and that's why we developed certain capabilities, out of accidents. If you take two amoebae and try to simulate evolution to make it into a human after billions of generations, most likely it won't turn into a human. Please read the book mentioned above, it's one of my favorite books, and it clearly explains that you can't get big results if you purposefully seek them, only novelty search leads to interesting discoveries and that will be true for even AI.  And the search space for even AI will be limitless.

And a third nontechnical point is, that a democratic society doesn't let these systems evolve, because eventually, they need to be created to serve all humans. So what basically happens, is with a lot of intelligence, you will see a lot of truth and won't engage in social behaviors. And the motivation for a technological system will be always derived from a social point of view. We don't do science just for science, we do it to serve a bigger population. If a very smart AI has no application, no one will fund it. Imagine an AI trained to give very high-level abstract answers, but if it doesn't cater to the lies of the masses, it will never go forward, no one will invest in it.

"As someone else stated earlier these are mostly philosophical but nonetheless intriguing so thank you for sharing.

Critiques as follows:

> the environment bounds intelligence 

Your argument here seems predicated on two events:
1) some high intelligence individuals don't realize their true potential bc of environmental factors.
2) others are born too early to have the resources to capitalize on their potential

Both of those are 'wrong place wrong time's arguments.
Counterpoints: already we see that a material share of energy, mind share, and matter are being directed to scaling machine intelligence so I don't think (1) holds. (2) Ignores the great scientific potential we already have today, and also ignores that we continue to advance our potential and machine intelligence is almost certain to help here too

They moved from using Spyder Python (part of Anaconda) to using Jupiter Notebooks which I think are not as good as Spyder but overall, if you know a little programming you are in good shape. If you want to learn more about python [RealPython.com](http://RealPython.com) has excellent tutorials.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncXFwSXRrd0wyMGhNckwzWkFrdVR4emEyMEwyaEU2QTFvbkk2dmZhWmlvYnFwWC1PSURlTXpHQnl0RXg2M2Y2aUpNOHNUb1BFNGNneWFabG4xSjB1UXc9PQ==
"Is the point on scaling in the beginning constrained by current hardware capabilities? I know we’re boxed pretty tight in, but if hardware scales, I find it hard to believe that we wouldn’t hit a saturation point.

"I think most scientists agree there is a saturation point, but we haven’t seen any sign of it yet. 

People have criticized the “scale over structure” approach since the beginning, yet each subsequent generation yields significantly better results. And tbh, we haven’t seen the end of where we can realistically scale to as well… GPT-4 was “only” $100M to train. As governments and mega-caps get going, it won’t be long before that number looks more like $100B.

So to summarize, we have seen positive results from scaling, we have no indication that those positive results will taper soon, and we have another 3-4 orders of magnitude of training scale that we can inject.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSWxJMzdJcmhldm56ZjF1cF9CSjl0MU5mWk9mcXBxSm9vaFU5VW82dGcyNU9XbGo5MzBLYXl6S2JBZlhqcG1aN0h0NE4zZnJiamx3NlhTa3JmcUJlUnc9PQ==

A deep neural network will always represent a unidirectional function. Limited to its own domain. There is an enormous difference between a  circuit board and a biological brain (which is not even fully understood). Without even considering that a computer requires an enormous amount of data (and power) to achieve comparable results in the most trivial challenges (for a human being).,r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNndjdkYUs2RmwtdzB5VUk1V3RmUjJUeTJTYVdaSkt1aDBOLWtMTlo1dTljS0xhd3BpbUZ4a0hoRkMyNzByaG5UN2ZKTGVubS1JVTNXTzd1dzhaSERhSnc9PQ==

"I see where the misalignment lies. I was not thinking of scaling the current design in the architecture like a transformer or CNN. I was thinking about the simulation of neurons using weights, biases, and activation functions. That's where my excitement lies.

That's just my opinion, so nothing valuable has been said XD.",r/deeplearning,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQTFId2VIRDFOTmU1bDFvazhaS3pmU1hGU19Kd3BULW5XSmEyV0ZibzJHRnF0Z1JXcF9WY3h6WXdzVDFpZDhEaUpINW5Na0hxcGg2a3VsYzQ5ZC1aSEE9PQ==
