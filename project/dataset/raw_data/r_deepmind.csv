"Devil's advocate: do remember, as recently as a few years ago, he did *not* think that AGI was imminent. Even in 2020, he was saying that artificial general intelligence was ""more than ten years away,"" and probably more than that. He didn't sign up to be that authority; he was of the mind that there was going to be a *LOT* more time than there actually wound up being, and that by the time we would get even reasonably close, there would be ample time for debates about how to proceed. OpenAI screwed that up by exploiting scaling laws and large language models, which was an unexpected path to the world models necessary to form the foundation for at least an early AGI. 

Think of the controversies about data scraping copyrighted material. That was also OpenAI. Google and DeepMind weren't pursuing that approach; Hassabis and his team were of the mind that a ""magical algorithm for intelligence"" would bootstrap us to AGI, but that algorithm was not known and even if we did know it, there'd still be too much work to reasonably accomplish it in the 2020s. Singularitarians hoped that maybe by the early 2030s, it'd be here, but it was most probably not intended to be on DeepMind's game plan for 20 years.

Even as late as 2022, DeepMind could comfortably ignore what OpenAI was doing right up until ChatGPT was released and made it *very* public how far ahead they were. Because before ChatGPT, OpenAI wasn't much different from how we view any other tech startup or something like ""McDonald's AI lab"". Maybe they have some nifty demonstrations and a novel idea or two, but the *real* leaders are DeepMind and their rivals at Baidu. But then they threw down the gauntlet and said ""We are a leap away from AGI.""

DeepMind's approach seems to be a much more thought-out and technically skilled one at that, so if they *do* take the lead, I'd still trust them to handle the alignment problem more than any subsidiary of Microsoft, but going back to what you're saying, I don't think they expected that they'd have to lead like this at all this soon. If you want to blame anyone, blame OpenAI and the fact there was no attempt at a top-down regulation of efforts, most likely because now that China's aware to the game, there straight up *cannot* be one.

"These are well-thought out positions. Do you work in the ML field, a Google employee perhaps?

All that history may be true, but people have choices. If you're on the wrong road, you can still turn back. Geoffrey Hinton did, and so did Yoshua Bengio. By continuing on the present path, let's be clear that Demmis and co are \\*deciding\\* to advance capabilities.

Additionally, I recognize the race dynamics are difficult, similar to a societal problem like global warming. 

However what I find so disagreeable about your take is that you're effectively positioning Demmis Hasabis and leading labs that aren't OpenAI as moderates. Saying they are moderates because they entertain AI existential risk issues is just frame control and completely irresponsible.

You would never enter a plane that had a 10% chance of crashing. Likewise, if you are working on a project which you believe has a 10% chance of ending the world in the next 20 years (Geoffrey Hinton's latest pdoom), that is reckless and needs to be stopped!

I do think some of the safety work done at the labs is good i.e. mechanistic interpretability, the supersafety team that OpenAI is starting, the safety research that's likely happening under the auspices of DeepMind.

Just look at what Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Max Tegmark and so on are doing. They are calling for regulation to minimize the existential risk all across the world. That is what someone in industry should be doing. The folks at the leading AI labs have twisted their minds around a logic, like yours, that somehow accelerating this tech helps the cause.
