"This is a great question. 

The Deep State's kryptonite is an informed and intelligent population.

 What is currently being ignored by the masses robs them of their money in hundreds of ways, most of them legal, but even if illegal, they are so shrouded in bureaucratic mystery that most people could tell that what was happening was illegal. People get coached into receiving government largesse if you are the ""right"" type or person, but the hammer comes down if a single mistake is made if you are the ""wrong"" type of person. For the right person, it is always a reasonable mistake, but for the wrong person, possible fraud.",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMEZqWHdENHdwLVZxekNEMzFLQ0QxOXpibTVwek5fc0RZN283YUpTVk9vS2dvdkVBLUpnQjdIQ2NVbmFza1VFZTF1V3ZMR0oxU2VSbjNWX2F1Q0lwcUE9PQ==
"Solid money could possibly have an effect during the coming crackdowns on digital banking, but not nearly as much as many gold hawks think. The issue is that retailers do not see precious metals as money and therefore it isn't. Robux is better ""money"" than gold, silver or btc, as there exists a fairly large population that would accept it just as readily or more so than dollars or euros. However it fails functionality when it comes to spending it on anything other than digital goods. The most likely dollar alternative is likely going to be a currency associated with an online game of some sort, but nothing stands out yet.",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSTk5TdWZXd1lYaEI5TWl0T0xWLVA1cHZRTDdBNExJZElpcGlFOXVpc2JIY0FBdTF4YmNHZllVa0gwSERSS1dGVmJ5YzZuaGhycjROX1dveVBXb2lLOWc9PQ==
"1) What do you know about the free-gold speakeasy, FOFOA, and “another” ?

And, 

2) how would you grade my assessment that money, value, and currency are three interconnected, yet different things.  Specifically: money is objective, value is subjective and currency is relative.  The rest of societal/class stratification, war, “diagnosis” and division-imho- is just a function of this proverbial trinity of factors, a fluid, dynamic game as predictable as any gamble played by masterful “players.”

As for myself, I’m just planning to take over the world, build a big spaceship, a gravitational wheel, put a ton of people and cool things on it, then blow up the earth and leave on the ship.

"Don't know what the free gold speakeasy, FOFOA OR ""another"" is.

 War is probably quite a bit more complicated, but not my area of expertise.

Money is the expected medium of exchange in a given transaction, currency is usually used as a synonym for money. 

Value can be denoted in money/currency, but not always. 
It can also be expressed in terms of enjoyment/vs/time or effort/vs/concrete results.",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSQjk4R0lsUzhKcVdiT0ZERGtZaGhjd0FMZkVCMHVFVjgyTG1KVFZXOFBWaGVLWUFaZmZLN1RkcFRlRC1WcGoxXzc0VmIyeDNDWjZjNXdLcmp6VXZXalE9PQ==
"I was not asking a rhetorical question when I literally asked how you would grade my understanding of money, value and currency. 

But projecting a crude, poorly worded definition of the three implies to me that you do not understand the underlying value that makes money and its derivatives even work: it retains its value, hence my objective description.  Maybe you are a deep state’er, projecting as such suggests you’re aligning with an ambiguous narrative that is about as useful as a bluff in a card game.  Do you play online poker much?",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSMFhTT3B6ekpnUXZiV3B1SGlPOXJ5b3REYkdsS0VwY2NiazJNSld1cEpwOUhCY2dpT0Zlb01BZ2RNSHVJU09YM3IwZ3FweGo0bG9Lak8yYnVPUXRIU3RYNVQ1VU5Ma0FxdFJRT2pVanRsdXM9
"No, I don't play online poker. ""The underlying value"" is not really a term that makes sense. The ""value"" of money for instance always is in flux, even gold or silver, to say that it has some underlying value appears to mean something immutable about money , but that isn't the case.  I am not projecting either. 

People like to give some mystical value to money and it's just not as complicated as all that. 

Money is simply a medium of exchange that both parties agree to, in that setting, value is subjective depending on either or both parties particular viewpoints, goals and experience, which is why negotiation happens. 

To suggest that there must be something underlying money is a myth.  The federal reserve notes are simply backed by the full faith and credit of the US, but to many people they don't have faith in us or really know what to make of the US's ""credit"", still use it.  A person who actively believes that there is no faithfulness to be had by the US and does not believe that a dollar is officially ""backed"" by anything will still offer prefer it.

It is preferred, simply because it is preferred by those they wish to purchase goods or services from. Getting technical and splitting hairs about terminology does nothing to change the facts on the ground. 

Usually the argument about backing comes from gold or bitcoin enthusiasts, and it would be great if there was some physical good actually backing money, it would likely protect it against inflation, but if you want to insinuate that money must be backed? it's just a poor argument. Go try to pay for your groceries at Walmart with a 1/10th Oz gold coin minted by the US Mint and see how far that gets you. It's not money because it's not mutually agreed to.",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJScVlGdERJbjJoeFNSRzhvWlprZmlrNThVSm9xNDRHTnhaOVF0X043T0thU1dabU1ka1lvV29rajNJbGZxNTFMbUtBTkpHN1kyNm82VDRFVWRzWnRtSkE9PQ==
"you lost me at “the value of money for instance is always in flux…”🤣🤣🤣😂 That is the greatest con since the Nixon Shock in one sentence.  

I said currency is RELATIVE for a reason.  Currency is a derivative of money, which is a real, tangible store of value that does not inflate based on an exchange rate, especially an exchange derived from valuations set in terms of a fiat dollar.  “But ignorance is bliss,” after all.

"Start with definition of terms.  How do you define ""deep state""?  Is there a generally accepted definition of ""deep state""?

Here is an attempt, feel free to share thoughts comments etc.

The deep state consists of individuals working in government positions with the intention of destroying the country from the inside out, establishing the new world order, and eliminate free thought, through various methods and tactics which include secret organisations, satanism, coercion, bribery, blackmail, gray-mail, fraud, threats, violence, control of the media, remote torture, trauma based programming, and murder.

"I would say the Deep State are the current powers that be (TPTB), the elite that work from the shadows but have a huge influence on the world. They control the Main Stream Media, many corporations. Their intentions can be seen most clearly in the policies of the World Economic Forum. 

I would consider organizations like the European Union, NATO and the United Nations to be highly infiltrated by Deep State people. 

In order to gain more influence They spread all kinds of theories that increase their power, like the climate change hoax. They are behind the vaccination craze that has created excess deaths until this very day. They want to push the removal of fossil fuels in order to gain more control over people's movements, since access to electricity can more easily be controlled.

They are deeply invested in the pharmaceutical companies. They control much of the science. They don't like free speech. They don't like TikTok and X.

I started a website that studies the Deep State, with many short articles that each focuses on one small aspect. If anyone is interested in joining me with this effort, I would gladly share the link.

The fact that this reddit group is rather small and relatively inactive goes to show how good they are hiding their intentions for rhe grand public. Let's change that!

"You fundamentally misunderstand the nature of the deep state.


 It isn't some club with heirarchy, official initiation and the like. It's just people who work for the government, work for big businesses aligned with the State Department's priorities and the leadership isn't defined, but rather a loose structure based on whoever is respected and politically anti american and also values the roles of their respective institutions. 

Also I expected to get dragged in the comments. People who are taken in by untrue conspiracy theories are generally lacking in discernment.

"Well a few things

1. I do believe (though I don’t have proof) that a thing called the “deep state” exists
2. In the absence of any info at all I only can think the deep state is organized somehow like a comic book Legion of villains.
3. That said, I always keep an open mind and if you say it’s not so maybe it’s not
4. That said again how do I even know if you’re for real?
5. Lastly, and just as kind of a funny thing, I’ve encountered many liberal type people on the internets who swear there is no deep state at all. Methinks it’s just because they want to believe the government is good like Santa Claus since their entire MO is big government",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjZEhUQ1BkTEJzMzBBVHpSUklZMFZiNDZTRGZ4UnlubVVMWF9ZZWVYRElleXJ3WWF5QnpSTFhsRHNOaWw4RTlRS0pCbjRPRUZIdVNpMTZiNWxaOFNHUVpqRldZUnJ1dkZZYTFJTk93QldkRlE9
"The deep state is like a loosly (or tightly at upward levels) associated group of usually like-minded people who believe they can help others usually themselves plus the poor brown folks (Asians and jews need not apply).

 at the lower levels almost nobody recognizes they are part of this organization and simply believe they are a government or military employee only. Those in the middle selectively promote those who share their ideology of paternalistic racism and elitism, and a large majority of these people have no idea they are in a deep state.

 Then to the higher levels they are in competition with others to virtue signal their allegiance to the anti judeo-christian anti americanism pro democracy ideology while sharing their tips in large well-funded conventions. 

None of this is hidden. 

You can go to the same government or military adjacent conventions yourself. It's NOT about coordination and top-down hierarchy. George Soros does set himself up as the leader in many ways however by funding a plethora of small to medium sized organizations, and the upper level deep state flaunt these connections publicly.

 Am I real lol? I just told you I am lower level surrounded by people who have no clue what they are part of. I am nothing special, I don't change major things from the shadows. My calls are monitored just like my coworkers.

 The George Carlin idea of the deep state is very accurate up to a point, but within these conferences there exists in one-on-one meetings, the complete corruption of moderately high levels of the deep state into the leading organizational structure of the deep state.

 The markers will have to all be there and then you get meetings with leaders of the soros affiliated groups or businesses and then tasks are handed out by inference and not out and out word.

 For instance read the DOL communiques to the States on UI fraud and you can see a change from the pre-pandemic guidelines which are squarely anti-fraud to covid era where fraud was encouraged by decree by focusing on speed of distribution of money vs any type of due diligence.

This signaled the corruption of the top levels of DOL to deep state and

 This activated the deep state within each state to parrot this pro-fraud message and to tear down any lower level activities that could counter the goal of forwarding massive fraudulent payments to the masses and organized crime syndicates run by Chinese nationals.

 Nothing is hidden here you can read the deadly boring guidance for yourself, but at the same time this is certainly a deep state doing. 


Just because it's out in the open does NOT mean that it is somehow not dangerous, somehow not worth attempting to topple and somehow not worth paying attention to.

Some of the things that happen within the deep state really ARE like they are imagined to be with other state actors being replaced etc etc, however the surprising part of that is that it really isn't deep-state led in the way that other things are even though the completely corrupted secretary of state office leads these clandestine missions, those actually carrying out the mission are often opposed to the deep state itself and do not always forward the goals of the deep state with their actions, causing a mixed bag of results varying from wins to losses for the deep state.

Hollywood has long been pro-communist in bent and this is deep state adjacent. The goal is to destroy truth itself thereby allowing for any narrative to be accepted.

 Take for instance the Hans Christian Anderson classic the little mermaid. It is a tale about a flighty young girl who ignores her local authority structure to follow the whims of her heart and rightly points out that by doing so she sews the seeds of her own destruction.

 But we don't know that story anymore do we? The story we know is this same girl got to be a princess and everything worked out just great in the end. this rapes the idea of prudence and produces the bastard child of unhinged emotionalism in young ladies which then leaves the opening for conniving young men to be incentivised to take advantage by promising the same feelings the Ariel was seeking to get these girls laid. This in and of itself caused a huge surge in single motherhood and was one of the major wins of the deep state... but everyone just thinks it's a fun harmless movie.

That is the deep state everyone should be worried about. 
The CIA doing stuff in Nicaragua is sexier to think about, but the co-opting of truths to forward lies are of bigger import.",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbEo2VzlBSVplVFF4Y0ZkRVJCcUM1M1pyelp1bnJPc1AwVVBwYzNLZVp0VWhEV2pJS2xmQTBwVW1PR3NZbE4tampEb24wN0s3dDR6a3VWVDBxZWtYVWc9PQ==
"This is kind of how I imagined it to be with one twist: the people at the bottom who’s MO for doing this is to as you put it “help black and brown people” I think the people at the top use them as useful idiots because they’re exploiting their bleeding hearts making them think that this is all to “help the poors” but in reality the real reason for the deep state is to get the wealthy even more disgustingly wealthy.

Am i close to the target on that one?

Finally, everything else you said makes sense and in a way is how I imagined it mostly. One question though: are you going to get in trouble for “spilling secrets”? Do they need to keep certain details hidden? Do they “take care of” anyone who exposes those secrets? Or is it no big deal because as you said much of the lower level stuff is out in the open anyway?",r/deepstate,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEM2Y5c1U3LTJ5SHI3dDRwN1JTclItTGFSM2dSYU43VEt5SlVJMDN4dkdJbFlab1RtUGV6YlJLMnhtLUhvZmF5U2twcTZyYThHQ1k5aWFlckw1bWRneGRqazVQMTljVjdRSFV3WEwzcGcwejA9
