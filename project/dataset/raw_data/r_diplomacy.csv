"May help to think about what you'd do if you were Turkey, since that's really what you're responding to. 

If I'm Turkey, Arm is attacking Sev. Nothing else for it to do, might as well cut that support. Not supporting this with Bla because I expect Mos to support Sev. 

I could try for an attack on Rum by Bul, supported by Bla and Ser, but I wouldn't expect that to work either. Gal probably supports Rum, and someone else probably attacks Ser and cuts support. 

But what I can do with Bla is attack Rum to cut its support for anything. Then if Bul supports Ser, Ser is safe from anything but an attack from Rum, which is unlikely and risky given how many Turkish units can attack Rum.

That lets me maneuver my fleets, with Alb going to Adr and Gre going to Alb, for a better shot in the following season.

That's not the only thing your Turkey can do, especially if they're afraid someone will move into Ion and want to keep a fleet in Gre. But it's both safe and the most likely way they can eventually crack you on this front given that you can otherwise hold out against them indefinitely if you play conservatively, so it's what they ought to try to do barring other concerns.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQcFN0Q180TUV1WVowci1PRkczWmFnQkw5ZnpyRjdzNEdwWXhqb0JRR1Z2ajFVVmRNUmtoREdJNVBkRmxQYlJEUkI4cmZMVFIyakI2a0RBNlV5cW1vdnc9PQ==

Turkey's one unit behind the line won't be of much effect because it's alone, unless it works in perfect harmony with France.

Turkey and Italy are not quite dead, but nearly so. After this, he is shocked that i stabbed him during the Spring? Mind you, i already have 2 fleets so together we have 4, and France is not in the Med so there is not much need for more fleets.

This is after he was greedy and insisted on taking Bulgaria (and the rest of Turkey) for himself. So we not exactly keeping 1:1 with supply centers. Not to mention, the fleet in Sev is awkward. It can't do much since he is already bottlenecked in Const

It got me Bulgaria, and due to the awkward position of his fleets in Turkey, he wasn't able to defend himself well. Also I got Germany to join my side so Russia was losing Warsaw and Sweden.

I was then able to negotiate a temporary ceasefire with Russia while I finished off Italy, and take Spain, hurting France enough to break the 6 year long stalemate he and England had, and win England over to my side.

After that I turned my attention back to Russia. I trapped his fleets in the med by blocking him out of const and went straight for his home supply centers. Basically closing the gates behind him as he was sailing out. This was the point when he decided to quit, cursing me for ruining a perfect alliance. I decided to offer him a draw since I felt bad, although we had equal supply centers, and I was in a much better position to press the attack, especially since I had Germany and England on my side.

"From just a glance, I think you have a choice between saving the army in Berlin and holding Denmark. Ber-Mun with support from Kie, Ruh and Bur will guaranteed work, but you’ll get dislodged in Denmark, which obviously isn’t ideal. There’s a chance Germany may use BAL to guarantee they get into Ber, but I wouldn’t count on it. I’m assuming Italy is also helping Germany into Munich. Ideal situation is you defend Den and get into Mun, but if Germany and Italy are coordinating you’re probably losing the army. Have you tried speaking to Russia?

You could Support Berlin into Munich and guarantee success, but the turn after that you will be pushed back again.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRTkgyM2k0b1IySzBUQVliRnV4bGFSVlp4TDl5VXpzdzRRUGdqN25xTlJ2TzFRUzJzekZFRWNJb193STYzUl93Q3BwZDVqZWJwSTU2eVNlRUdyRmJvZGc9PQ==
"If the sole goal is not being forced to disband, yes. Bur and Ruh can support Ber to Mun, and that will (almost certainly) keep the army over there, likely in Mun, rather than forced disbanding.

If the goal is saving Ber, the supply center, there's nothing foolproof. Germany can guarantee it by supporting Bal into Ber with Sil and Boh. Nothing you can do to prevent that. Likewise if Bal attacks Kie to cut support and one army supports the other to Ber.

If they're silly enough to try to support an army in with both Bal and the other army, you could hold onto Ber by supporting it with Kie and having Den attack Bal to cut support, however, that risks the nightmare outcome where you lose Ber AND Den without getting Swe (if Bal is supported into Ber, your Den fleet ends up in Bal, and an attack on Den from Ska then takes Den).

I don't really have a good play for you, the position is tenuous. The good news is they're not even going to have anywhere open to build, but to finish them, you've got to find a way to bring more fleets to bear without letting Italy into MAO or Iberia/Marseilles, and that's going to be a tall order. 

You've had a nice game so far, but Italy has no real opposition and is about to roll barring a major shift in dynamics. Germany doesn't have the armies to stop it on land, and you're going to have trouble getting fleets in position to stop them at sea. With no sense of the dynamics and betrayals and burned bridges and just looking at the map, Germany and you would be best served holding the main stalemate line together and ensuring a three-way with Italy. Then when Italy eats Germany's southern centers, maybe you cut out Germany in the north and make that a two-way with Italy, if you can and depending on seriousness of the game and relationships.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRWllLZDF4Vk5rNk1fa2VadzN2dVpoYmw4T0dJcDU5MnNfVkFnUmwyZEtfVk5JQURSRng0MkpfSHQwaVRWNU1GYmZhYjFOQVBlcFVQQVdNdzhHcF90b3c9PQ==
"I've played in Dip tournaments since the mid 1980s, with breaks. 

Get your tactics down pat. Know where the majority and minority stalemate lines are. This will help you determine strategy, but only so far as your potential allies and enemies will let you. Openings are flexible depending on your reading of the opening round negotiations. For instance, when I play England, I really prefer to secure the northern seven centers, which can be, coincidentally, a stalemate position if Germany removes the fleet:  Edi, Lon, Lvp, Nwy, Swe, Den, Stp. I am inclined to open to Nwg, Nth, and Edi/Yor. HOWEVER, if Russia comes hard with a proposal to take down Germany or if Italy and Germany come hard with an anti-French proposal and Russia agrees not to commit northward, I might adjust and open to the Channel to attack France.

So, openings are contingent. Just know where you need to get to from a tactical perspective but let the strategy (i.e., your negotiations) lead the way.

Learn how to read board position. Don't be over-reliant on your ally's/allies' reassurances. Make sure they cannot threaten you. If they can take advantage, they probably will. That's part of the game. The board position will perhaps tell you more about what's to come than what people will tell you.

Finally, and more importantly, know how to quickly and accurately write consistent orders. Misorders are a definite thing and I've seen them take players completely out of the tournament, as happened just this summer at the Origins tournament in Columbus, OH. Don't let a misorder ruin your plans. 

If you want practice in writing orders, there is no better place to play than at [https://Dipbounced.com](https://Dipbounced.com), as this site forces you to type in unit orders instead of using a UI to generate them. It is super helpful for building consistency in order writing.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXS1AtSENPWFJkanBiNzI1SzlKZTRfbnFXUFYwT2VYNi1EUlI1N0lHbjc0SnZlYlUzdmZLRzZrMThYSkMxS0xUMUlJU0U3WDU5SUE3S0ItclFmQWt6SkE9PQ==
"Realistically, he's not attacking DEN with support. If he does you retreat to SWE and he's net neutral.

So he's focused on BER and MUN. MUN is attacked with support from TYR. The guessing game is around BER.

The only fool proof way for him to attack is to attack by fleet, with support from his armies. That of course largely hobs him of future attacks into Germany, and it's questionable how worth it that is.

The safe play is to retreat to MUN and make a play for SWE while guarding DEN. It causes enough chaos and buys you time elsewhere. If you're ballsy, try and attack his fleet, but as others have said, the downside is you could lose both units. 

But overall, you need to wrap up England. That's the priority. Take England and use it to free up fleets and convoy armies around Germany.

Edit: Alternatively he could be using SKA as a trick here. SKA could be making a move to SWE to cover his open centers. Then attacking BER with his fleet. In that case, move an army to DEN, fleet to BAL, move BER to MUN with support. You'll lose a unit but also set yourself up nice to gain next season",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXNW1DNTM2ZnNLWGdtY2tiWUJIZjFELUxndWtidkRWVWc0alkyLVo3MkthS3c0UWJjLXgxOWgtQjI2LXNGY1lmV194Z3R2dE5tYi1DN3Baa3pFVGhmZHc9PQ==
"The Boston Massacre is a great Diplomacy tournament. I think you’ll have a great time! My suggestions are pretty simple. 

1. Show the other players you are reliable, understand the basic game mechanics, and can write good orders. In face to face tournament play, negotiation time is extremely valuable. Consider time a currency. If you can prove that you can write orders and understand basic tactics like when a support will be cut, the experienced players will be more willing to spend their negotiation time working with you. You don’t need to impress anyone with fancy tactics or grand strategy, just prove you understand the fundamentals of the game. 

2. You will be at a disadvantage because you do not have past history with the tournament players. At most tournaments you have two crowds, the locals who probably play together a few times a year, and the travelers who also probably play each other a few times a year at various tournaments across the globe. I love asking players if they have any history with the other players and who to watch out for. You can learn a ton about the human side of this game with this simple question. If someone is chatty, ask them if they can characterize the play style of the people they have played with. Not everyone is willing to spend their negotiation time answering this, but if someone is willing to share it can at least give you a head start on understanding what to watch out for. 

3. You will be at an advantage because you do not have past history with the tournament players. While it absolutely a disadvantage to have no experience playing with the other players it’s also an advantage because you don’t have baggage. We all claim not to remember past games and for some of us that’s generally true, but we do tend to remember specific times where someone screwed us over, or have opinions about if we are likely to work well with another player or not. As a new player, you are a blank slate. You can build your own reputation and won’t have to worry about someone being mad at you for something you did five years ago during a game you can’t remember anything about but they can give you a turn by turn recap of what a horrible person you are. Not that I know anything about that since I am an alliance player who is a great ally to everyone. 😇

4. Be prepared for the games to feel *fast*. This is particularly true if you haven’t played face-to-face but is even true if you have played face-to-face but not in a tournament setting. There is never enough time. Time is a major currency. Watch out for people intentionally trying to waste your time preventing you from negotiating with others. Don’t go into negotiations until you have written the starting location of each unit. Take one minute to review the board and compose your thoughts. If possible, try to have a plan on what you would like to see happen before negotiating. You can always adjust your plans based on negotiations, but taking this time for yourself can help slow the speed of the game and reduce the odds someone will sweet talk you into something that is bad for you. 

5. Have fun. There are two things I love about tournaments. First, the quality of play will likely be higher than most other environments. It’s rare to find people as passionate about the game of Diplomacy outside of a tournament environment. Second, the community is amazing. While there are occasional bad apples, the Diplomacy community has been one of the best I have had the chance to be a part of. They tend to be extremely intelligent, are often more social than many other gaming communities due to the nature of the game requiring negotiation, and come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Take the time to get to know people outside the game table. Diplomacy players love talking about themselves. Go out for a drink or food between games, get someone talking about their favorite opening and then transition into what they do for work, what their other hobbies are, etc. For the most part people are quite welcoming and if you ever don’t feel comfortable just excuse yourself and move to another table. There are far more amazing people in this hobby than not. You’ll be amazed at who you can meet! 

I hope you enjoy the Diplomacy tournament community as much as I do. Even if it’s just half as much, you’re in for a great time. 😎",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXcUpFVHR3SFB2ODc3a3BtUVZDRWVPaURxMFp1dXVPRHdoemhqU05hYjQ2YTlfckZGSHl6b0FNUEhpZWJnN2VBX1ZHWnFFb2NRUlpST3ZoNG9pOUVCeHc9PQ==

"Welcome to the f2f tournament scene. Its amazing!

My main advice would be to have fun. Legit, that's it. Most people don't win tournaments, and some people are guaranteed to do badly. The joy of a Diplomacy tournament is the people, I mean, if we didn't like people we'd play chess right? Dont over think things, accept the fact you'll get sucked in to a game and do stuff you would never do online. If you have a good time getting to know great people, it wont matter if you do well or not. 

  
Now if you really want to do well, I have one piece of advice. Have fun. With fast paced in person games, who is 'fun to work with' is often the deciding factor in an alliance. If you're an enjoyable person to play with, and you're clearly enjoying yourself, that will become infectious and will bode well for your chances. If you're stressed and too tense, people will attack you because of 'bad vibes'. 

Dont worry about preparing tactics or strategies. If you walk in to a game with plans you'll get stuck in those plans and wont be able to adapt to the most critical part of the game, the personalities. 

  
Enjoy yourself, and revel in how amazing a weekend of your favourite board game with great people can be :)",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXS1lGcWJuSXNERXV3RnZMbUd5ZWUtdkNDWl85aDNJYlZvLVlGWEZ5ZzBod0UzcmJpRTYzYnl2blZ2bWVQaUZhYWZadFlJTHVPWm9qcGg4ejlwaWpaWkE9PQ==
"Be quick to forge alliances/say yes to plans. That way u can be a step ahead of others when time is up.
Don't downplay ur experience and ability at the game in conversations and getting to know other players/ making friends. It shows weakness/inexperience and may telegraph urself as a target.

"One thing I didn't understand going into tournaments that is totally different from casual play--the tournament scoring system usually means players are trying to survive instead of win. Many are unwilling to take risks.

"I have a very simple rule. Only build if you absolutely have to. My advice would be to waive as much as possible. Sounds like a joke, but it isn't.

"Hmm, you could have scouts, yes, which can perhaps move faster and support as usual but cannot take centers or cut support. If double movement speed is too much, perhaps only the spring season should involve scouting for that year's campaign and the fall season should not allow extra scout movement.

I'd not generically name them ""cavalry"" since generally cavalry has been stronger than infantry historically.

"I don't think its a stalemate because England doesn't control Portugal.

What I would do as Austria/Italy is hold MAO, while working to get an army in Spain. Once that is done, Austria can get MAO fleet into Gascony while preventing Italy from retaking MAO. Then Austria can get another fleet into MAO. At this point England is tied up defending everything. So you can have Mars go to Gascony, Gascony back to North coast Spain, and Spain to Mars. That will give Italy two armies in Gascony and Mars. Burgundy cannot be held , and then eventually the rest of the links of chain start breaking for England

edit: it would be easier i think if Austria went for North coast of Spain with MAO supported by LYO, and moved Spain to MAO supported by Portugal, NAF and WES. Then, do a convoy into Gascony supported by the fleet in Spain. Quicker to pull off. Regardless, I don't think it is a statemate because Austria/Italy still have attacking ideas in the West.

"Played a Classic - Layered game on vDip. Only 2 boards instead of 5 but still very fun. EFI final draw. Openings didn't get too wacky but there was some interesting play from Italy and Russia in S01/F01. 

Italy sent his army in Venice from board 1 to B2 Venice, B2 Venice went to Tyrolia. Set him up to have 2 armies take Trieste in F01 (on B2, he just defended with A Rom -> Ven on B1). Russia also transferred an army from Mos1 to Mos2 but that ended up not mattering since he acquired Rum + Swe on both boards and Vie2 - he built 5 and mostly equalized the unit count across boards.

Diplo in the west was pretty fun since EGF had 2 Belgiums to divide between them. Ended up with a successful English convoy into Bel2 and a bounce in Bel1. Ultimately France got Belgium on both boards

Beyond that, most people tried to keep their movements consistent across the boards to prevent too many holes appearing in lines. Would be fun to play again!

"could someone please help me understand the rules here? i was playing on webdiplomacy as turkey and was puzzled when the french army in bohemia was allowed to take vienna. my fleet in the adriatic was supporting trieste and i'm confused why this wasn't enough to allow the army in trieste to support the army in vienna.

"""My fleet in the Adriatic was supporting trieste""...all this does is support TRI to hold (which is what you're doing when you issue a support order: you're holding in your province, supporting another move). It doesn't provide any defense against having your support cut. You could have had BUD, SER, ADR, and ALB all support TRI (pretend you had pieces in the open territories), and all that would help you with is stopping a supported move from dislodging you out of TRI, not maintaining TRI's support of VIE.

One move is enough to disrupt support, with the only exception being if the move comes from the territory that an attack is being supported into. (Imagine three units: French VEN; Turkish ADR & TRI. Moves are VEN->TRI; ADR ->VEN, TRI S ADR->VEN. VEN's move fails and does not cut TRI's support because that support is for an attack on VEN.)",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnZmo4YTA1ZU1EZFFHc3JLYjV2bmVsNTFnclF2NVBsWVRDeW4zTnk3bENlZ0tBZjN3VUxNRjBpRzAxS2cyNjNpd1RmZ2VtZWtTWVE5Z1FYcTh2MG9tU3c9PQ==
thank you! i'm surprised i got so far without knowing this. for some reason i thought one unit supporting a second unit that is also supporting a third unit would negate an attack on the second unit. will change play accordingly,r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMU1nVDBBazJlYzdTRzFBSmRYZXNNVnltclkwV0lpd1J5SGR6M0hGTGE2RGFnS0VtLVFDSGlsWU41cE9BYS1KbkdGWGZhV3h4M2ZEY2N3dnc0TWs4YlE9PQ==
">if tri had support from adr and ven had no support going into tri, why couldn't tri support vie?

There is no way to support a support.  A support either succeeds, or if it suffers any attack, regardless of strength, it is cut.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnb3NUQjR4Z3R0RG03REo3MlhZZk5PTURhVVdTMzRLZ1l6VXRFeFRrdkNyLV81TG44aGpCTnVpNkhCbnJPUktwNjJUdHo1QTBKNnMybENCdlpneGdJVVE9PQ==
"just to confirm, assuming every other moves was the same, since one move is enough to disrupt support would i have held position with orders ADR->TRI, TRI->TYR, VIE S TRI->TYR? thanks again",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYW9BNlF6SjBITVFMZGtReEk0Q01acDkwMHJuUXpBbmdEcklWSUhLcUQ1YjAwaFBjMXc3T3hSaGREdmpZNmJuVy1iRXdzeXQ0OFhmbTFVVzhGdUtOMUE9PQ==

"Since it hasn’t been said yet, it looks like France might not know the rules either. I don’t know the platform/symbols here but it looks like Rome and Apulia are both supporting Venice to hold, while Venice is moving to Trieste to cut support. I’m your situation, Adriatic S Trieste to Venice would’ve succeeded, as Rome/Apulia can’t support a unit to hold if that unit is moving. 

I could be mistaken and it could be something like Rome S Apulia to Venice (which would’ve blocked you moving in) but it doesn’t look like it.",r/diplomacy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNncU9WOXJ4S3lvSjhxRUZBV1JFQmZIOTRuT0E3X3JDdGVZRXUwaWN6cUtlUWlKalVocTZfVlRWRUMwVjRYRGFzbGhUZDJmT0IzUU9DSDdQekpuYzVQanc9PQ==

Backstabbr has a sandbox you can make separate of any game.

In theory I would say that in a game that is so balanced, having one extra unit is meaningful.
