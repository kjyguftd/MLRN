This is a blatant attack on freedom of speech that sets a dangerous precedent. Instagram has already shadowbanned our account, and we expect a full ban on all platforms soon. But remember how it ended last time for totalitarianism in Europe.”

The biggest problem is these platforms aren't outright banning it

> Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram ... have all labeled Redfish as a “Russia state-controlled media” organization and users who click on a link from their Facebook page or try and share one of their posts, are greeted with the following message: “This link is from a publisher Facebook believes may be partially or wholly under the editorial control of the Russian government.”

"Consortium News is not fake. Putin invaded. There were reasons he did so; like the expansion of NATO and Americas role in the 2014 government coup.

"I love naive cynicism. There’s very little more unpersoning than that. Sure, buddy, the US was able to maintain a massive alliance structure because it was about fleecing its allies, which presumably never realized that or something.

It’s the silliest thing.

TL;DR: even if NATO had announced its dissolution the day the Soviet Union collapsed, the reality of NATO military integration meant it would have actually been a 10-20 year plan to dissolve NATO.

No, NATO persisted for years because NATO is for countries what combined arms is for militaries. Every NATO country is integrated militarily and ultimately plans its defense around NATO membership, meaning that they either lack certain capabilities entirely or in sufficient quantity. Removing a country from NATO would require its own decade-long investment in replacing the capabilities it gets from NATO. That would be made more difficult because the NATO commitment itself solves political problems in military spending by shaping its role in the overall structure.

Actually leaving NATO would require massive changes to a member’s military, so even if the government had that as a goal, it would be unlikely to leave for a decade or more just because it takes time to unwind and replace the NATO structure.",r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSeDBvSWRPcHZvTmNVemxUbUdzZV8wQko3WnE2RjVodVQtbjRKNS1hMXg4X0ZvSEFwbXBwZHJib2UxMVJ5RjVtLVNHTUNnMURkemtpQzRoS2d6b0RER0dWa3Y0dGhaSC1hekw4Zkc1Ty1TdUU9

"That's exactly right. There's a lot of videos just like this, where some propagandist gives a false description of a real video, then falsely claims that somebody else originated that false description.

There's an excellent recent ProPublica article about it here: https://www.propublica.org/article/in-the-ukraine-conflict-fake-fact-checks-are-being-used-to-spread-disinformation

> Researchers at Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub and ProPublica identified more than a dozen videos that purport to debunk apparently nonexistent Ukrainian fakes. The videos have racked up more than 1 million views across pro-Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram, and have garnered thousands of likes and retweets on Twitter. A screenshot from one of the fake debunking videos was broadcast on Russian state TV, while another was spread by an official Russian government Twitter account.

> The goal of the videos is to inject a sense of doubt among Russian-language audiences as they encounter real images of wrecked Russian military vehicles and the destruction caused by missile and artillery strikes in Ukraine, according to Patrick Warren, an associate professor at Clemson who co-leads the Media Forensics Hub.

> “The reason that it’s so effective is because you don’t actually have to convince someone that it’s true. It’s sufficient to make people uncertain as to what they should trust,” said Warren, who has conducted extensive research into Russian internet trolling and disinformation campaigns. “In a sense they are convincing the viewer that it would be possible for a Ukrainian propaganda bureau to do this sort of thing.”

....

> The videos combine with propaganda on Russian state TV to convince Russians that the “special operation” in Ukraine is proceeding well, and that claims of setbacks or air strikes on civilian areas are a Ukrainian disinformation campaign to undermine Russian confidence.",r/disinformationwatch,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJST1BxSWZkTVhRLXhKZFZ4RWEyNWhxei1Ldmw4SGlGalBPd1VMWm1uby1Pa3c5akFNdjlxYnljQ1R6YTN3UzZMekVJOUdiVTZ5aVowcDVzVHhrUi1EWmw1RFE4N3FDbkRYN2k4OFRuVnJsVTQ9

"Reminder: Do not vote and do not comment in any of the threads we talk about here! That constitutes brigading and violates Reddit's terms of service. If the admins catch you, they might suspend your account. If we catch you, we will have to ban you and report you to the admins. We cannot afford to be lenient. The future of this sub depends on it.

[Reporting](https://www.reddit.com/report?reason=this-is-misinformation) rule-breaking content DOES NOT constitute brigading however. In fact, reporting is how the admins WANT you to interact with rule-breaking content.
