"It doesn't surprise me that 2020 didn't put an end to it. Qanon has used shifting goalpost from the start. That and the fact that it's ""user-driven,"" allowing the crazies to develop their own narratives, it's kind of built to sustain anything.

"Okay, so u dangrullon87 responded, but deleted their response. This is what it said, and my response to it below:

> To clarify, BlueAnon has been pushing hard project 2025 into the main stream as if its a fact. Similar to how Qanon pushed the whole Trust the Plan, Patriots in control bullshit. Its hyper polarazing the left into believing the right wing are going to put people into camps if they win in 2025. Just like Qanon was telling people muh military tribunal, the left is evil globalist baby blood drinking pedos. I feel the Larp just shifted from right to left. Its just as toxic, deceptive and polluting the minds of millions of people. It SCREAMS foreign disinfo at worst, LARP gone out of control at best. If people remember Qanon had a manifesto too that seems ""plausible"" about the lefts plan to microchip everyone, climate lock downs, etc similar to the structure of project 2025.

Project 2025 *is* a real thing, though. It's a legitimate, genuine outline put together by a legitimate, well-known mainstream political organization. The creators themselves call it a ""playbook.""

You can certainly argue that aspects of it have been exaggerated or spun into more than it actually says by some fringe players - anyone claiming it means the plan is to put people into camps, for example - but the core concerns that have been aired about it are based on the actual document itself.

Whether or not they can actually *implement* their agenda is an open question, but the agenda itself isn't some left wing LARP or fairy tale. The document is right there for anyone to read, there is zero question about it's authenticity and origin, and it legitimately *does* outline a playbook that should concern many Americans, such as the idea of dumping countless thousands of government employees and replacing them with conservative loyalists.

This isn't some made-up equivalent to a fake leftist manifesto concocted by Qanon folks, it's a genuine political playbook authored by genuine power players and a genuine, influential mainstream political organization.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRBUDRHX09CX3lnUm1UVHVGTDNEZnpxN2IxUGtKelZhYzJIcm5ZMXNsRUVnTndQMkFWWjZYT3F4b05wN2lwT244ejQ5dnZzTDg2aXpKeUUtRzRzNzdWQ3c9PQ==

"""Widespread, wide-ranging."" Lol, lmao, nobody even on the right takes Qanon seriously.

"Oh, the person above is a bait-laying doofus trying to call two things equivalent that absolutely *aren't*, but it *is* true that there are left-wingers casting doubt on whether or not the shooting was legitimate. Easy enough to find them in just a few clicks, too. It's undeniable that the sentiment has circulated.

However, it remains relegated to a small number of fringe, deluded goofballs. They are, for the moment, beneath notice and not really worth considering. They're just Twitter randoms. There is no movement and any attempt by people like the above to liken them to the Qanon cult is simply an attempt to obfuscate, deflect, and distract.

Look through their post history and it quickly becomes clear why they'd want to do this, too. They're a bad actor.

If said sentiment ever grew in scope and was taken seriously by more than a few randoms, if it ever grew influential in even a small way, I'd be first in line to call it out.

But right now, that isn't the case. It's just idle chatter on Twitter by a small number of nobodies.

"project 2025 was written by the same federalist society ghouls that gave trump his list of people to choose supreme court justices from.  you'd probably said that was all hype before it happened as well. These are literally trump's marching orders from the people that are funding him...

Trump doesn't know anything about policy (or politics for that matter) he simply wants power. That's the bargain: the heritage foundation backs him so he gets the power to implement project2025.. that's literally the whole thing. project 2025 is, in layman's terms, ""abolishing the administrative state"" - that's literally what it is.

"My favorite part of this documentary is when she sent someone to film the outside of the sorority house.  A passerby asks why they were filiming the house and she tries to use that as evidence that there was this grand conspiracy to silence the media. Uhhh no, you're just being a creep.

"The opening sentence of your article is a lie. ""Set for approval at the Republican convention"". Project 2025 was never mentioned at the convention. In 2016 trump said he would use the federalist society judge recommendations. Now in 2024 trump is saying he doesn't agree with a lot of project 2025. It's being used as a boogyman and it's so dumb. Trump is not a traditional conservative like the heritage foundation is. The only reason he used the federalist society judges in 2016 was to sway conservative voters who were on the fence about him at the time because like I said he's not a traditional conservative so they right wingers thought he might appoint a liberal judge. It's comical really. Traditional conservatives say hes too liberal and left wingers think he's a right wing fascist. 

Bottom line y'all are grasping for straws because you know you're screwed in the coming election. All you have is trump is going to end democracy which is so existential and hyperbolic that only the die hard Dems actually believe it.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDUENDc0h2eWhHYkFJMFN1UFZoamZmb011aGRUSy0ycUFFd0t3XzBQcU5lcWJhRnhuRW9qb3hIVVY2aVNsbXluSVBNQURDT01pSldIWjBGeGdPOThBb0E9PQ==

there are plenty of other stuff too... called veterans suckers and losers, cheats on his pregnant wife with porn stars, shows our nations classified documents to golfing dentists just to brag. tried to pressure election officials in my state. 

and all the other stuff is true too... he is a stooge for the same old evangelical heritage foundation Christian conservatives as literally ANY other republican. The only difference is he doesn't have respect for the constitution and norms that other republicans used to. He only cares about himself, he'd burn this country down to have power over the ashes.

"The humanitarian VR documentary ""Meet the Soldier"", an initiative by non-profit venture Hack The Planet of digital product studio Q42, is about two Ugandan fighters from conflicting tribes. In normal life, it is unthinkable that these enemies come close together. Virtual reality offers an innovative way for the fighters to meet each other, to empathize with the other. The viewer of the film in turn undergoes this rapprochement in virtual reality. Will the two enemies achieve empathy, with reconciliation as a result?  
  
""Meet the Soldier"" was nominated for a Gouden Kalf in 2018 and won a Golden SpinAward that year in the category 'Augmented & Virtual Reality', the highest achievable trophy in the field of digital marketing and creativity in the Netherlands.

"Google's summary of the documentary:

> Through the lens of national security and global stability, a look at the impacts of climate change on increased resource scarcity and migration. As part of a case-study analysis, admirals, generals and military veterans take viewers beyond the headlines of the conflict in Syria, the social unrest of the Arab Spring, the rise of groups like ISIS, and the European refugee crisis -- and lay bare how climate change stressors interact with societal tensions, sparking conflict.


--------------------------------------------------------------

As for Syria itself, as mentioned in the documentary, it suffered a sustained drought from 2006 to 2011, right before the Syrian Civil War kicked off: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Syria#Five_years_of_drought_(2006%E2%80%932011)

> In 2007 and 2008, Syria failed to produce wheat due to having had the driest winter on record causing the agricultural share to fall to 17 percent.[2] Farmers and herders were producing zero or near-zero livestock (such as wheat, and rice), forcing them to begin importing products for the first time in 15 years.[3][2] This caused prices of wheat and rice to drastically increase. In 2010, the drought completely demolished the environment causing malnutrition and nutrition related diseases among children of 6 to 12 months old were suffering from anemia in Raqqa.[3] People began migrating towards the urban areas causing an 80 percent lack of enrolment in schools.[2]

Also mentioned in the documentary were the 2010 global droughts and wildfires that ravaged farmlands in Ukraine, Russia and China, causing global food prices to skyrocket. The Middle East imports a large quantity of grains from the global market:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932012_world_food_price_crisis

> The deflated FAO food price index reached an all time high in 2012.[5] As a result of a very dry summer in the United States and Europe, corn and soybean prices reached all-time highs in July 2012 and prices remained high throughout 2012[1]

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/05/vladimir-putin-ban-grain-exports

> High temperatures, lack of rain and wildfires have devastated more than a third of cultivable land in Russia, the world's fourth largest grain exporter.

> News of the ban pushed wheat prices to a 23-month high on commodities markets and raised concerns about a boost in food prices worldwide.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932011_China_drought

>  It was the worst drought to hit the country in 60 years, and it affected most of wheat-producing regions in the PRC.

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-11003544

> Ukraine may cut grain exports for the remainder of 2010, following the impact on crops of a severe drought. The move would follow Russia's ban on grain exports on Sunday because of drought and a spate of wildfires.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRDOFNZZFdNQmt0Z3RDWGkyZlJmaTRrdGF4M1pIdlFONzI3bEpod0VtdHRFRWJ6aHNqdGtCNWhBX2toT1hpQWJva2FVVUNHRElCa2daZEVyWWFEZ1RSVFE9PQ==

"Yes, they were bots. I was single in the early 2000s and signed up for every dating site at the time. My thinking with Ashley Madison was that the ""married"" angle was just a gimmick and it would be a regular dating site because how would that even work? Before I could even put up a photo or finish my bio I was getting messages from accounts with photos of ridiculously beautiful women. This was back in the day when you had to scan a physical picture to put it on the Internet. And all the women on Ashley Madison had professional headshots instead of underexposed images taken on disposable cameras of women with awkward smiles standing in their living rooms.

You had to pay to reply which I never did. Every other day I'd get an email notice and check and it was clear they were bots. On a regular site, you didn't have to pay to message anyone and guys had to go chasing meth heads with missing teeth, so it was odd that so many rich, classy women with professional headshots would be chunking themselves at someone without a photo and a half finished bio.

"> The number of sports betting sites exploded during the coronavirus pandemic. This business, which relies on people with a gambling addiction, is legally all above board. But the sites are run by international companies that employ controversial methods.

> How can this billion-dollar business, whose influence extends into the worlds of sport and politics, be stopped? The sports betting sector generates huge revenues and profits by exploiting some of the weakest members of society. With impunity. 

> Around 37 million Euros worth of bets are placed every day in Europe. The market has grown 40-fold over the past 20 years. 

> This success isn’t a fad, but the result of a perfidious marketing strategy. Various platforms deluge the public sphere with betting incentives for every major sporting event: Continuous advertising loops, omnipresence on social networks, sponsorship of sports programs and football clubs, collaboration with sports stars and influencers. 

> More and more people are becoming addicted to gambling because of this aggressive advertising. Some of them are driven to ruin, even suicide.

> Most internet platforms belong to one of five multinational companies. They operate largely unnoticed by the public, and use their money to finance sports clubs and political parties. Like the tobacco industry, they also work to promote addictive behavior. 

> In France, 60 percent of their turnover comes from people with problematic gambling behavior. The companies do not shy away from manipulation, and sometimes even intervene in legislation. Health science is sounding the alarm and calling for government action, but most European countries are ignoring the problem.

"The Batman is an American animated television series based on the DC Comics superhero Batman. Developed by Michael Goguen and Duane Capizzi, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the series first aired on Kids’ WB on September 11, 2004, then Cartoon Network on April 2, 2005. The show would become exclusive to the former network for its third, fourth, and fifth seasons in early 2006. The Batman won six Daytime Emmy Awards over the course of its run. Many elements from previous Batman storylines were borrowed and adapted, such as those from the comic books, film series and the animated shows like Batman: The Animated Series from the DC Animated Universe, but it remained strictly within its own distinct continuity. Jackie Chan Adventures artist Jeff Matsuda served as art director and provided the character designs. The production team altered the appearances of many of the comic books’ supervillains for the show, such as the Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and the Riddler.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRWYXY2VEdsOXdaSXBNN0dyTXVJZThldWE4Tm1ISHFQQzlEczRqaThhNG56VlgwVWg2ZXpWTTNoQ0ZHQ0N5Zkpvd1JiU182djFUU2poVnY5Yk95VFNrTXc9PQ==

"You might have noticed that a lot of things seem to suck right now. This film isn’t about all the things that suck—that would be a really long film. But it is about consumption, which is both a cause and a symptom of the suckiness. For a bunch of reasons, pretty much everyone is making and buying too much stuff, which we are evolutionarily programmed to want. What was once an advantage (more! = better!) is now contributing to the destruction of the planet.

The Shitthropocene is a journey from the cellular origins of our lack of impulse control to the ways our central nervous systems have been hacked in the name of capital. It’s also about how we might begin to save us from ourselves.

"In the late 60's a group of poets, writers and musicians descended upon the lawless tip of the United States to pursue their love of literature and fishing (and cocaine and acid). Initiated by Tom McGuane - the prodigal son of American Literature in the 1970's - his friends Jim Harrison, Richard Brautigan, Russell Chatham and Jimmy Buffett soon joined him. This crew and that era were captured on film by Guy De La Valdene and Christian Odasso in an obscure documentary called ""Tarpon"" in 1974. They went on to create some of the best art, poetry, novels, and music of their generation - but there will never be anything like Key West in the early 70's.

"The film explores the idea of the American dream- that if you’re willing to work hard, you’ll be able to make a living and build a better life for your children.    
  
Starting in 1991, the film-makers follow two families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA over the next 30 years as they attempt to raise their children while coping with changing economic conditions.    
  
Through interviews and footage filmed in their homes and communities, the film provides an up-close and personal window into history, allowing the viewer to witness the shift from the time when manufacturing jobs  allowed people to raise families and own homes on their salaries.

"Shit tier stuff is a product of the world economy. Surprise, a lot of the poor decisions of the US (the world reserve currency) create a bunch of problems. The US main export is ink on paper/cotton. Other countries now need the dollar to help resolve debts. They are more or less forced to trade with us to get out paper. As the US inflates its monetary supply, not only the US citizens feel it, but everyone that uses the dollar worldwide. This is great for the US consumer because we will feel the inflation less, but it has it's drawbacks.

Printing/fabricating/counterfeiting money, which the US is very good at, means that the value of the money is lessened. When the value goes down, either the price of goods and services can go up, or you can produce your good or service cheaper with less quality. There is plenty of quality stuff out there, but the price is prohibitive, so a bunch of cheap shit is produced. Because the US doesn't really manufacture anything anymore, they have to buy just about everything, which has to include the massive costs of everything, raw materials, transportation, manufacturing, transportation again.

The US basically has to consume or the currency doesn't flow out to the rest of the world which would cause major disruptions in the global supply chain. We end up with a bunch of shit quality because it's what can be mass produced at a cheap cost.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmaldaRURnYVNPNWZpa3pYVWVzVUFaN1Nmb2RsMnE5TGVqWUFudXVRX2J6eEpZbmEwMi1LY2RJcVd4WURHaEowYWw2VnduN0Q3aDgtZlJjSzcxcEdfamc9PQ==

It didn't explore our consumption habits, it didn't didn't explore why most things have gotten worse and it's just become the norm, it didn't explore why online quick-ship retailers are kicking the shit out of local stuff.

"Excellent original piece and excellent follow-up. Moyer is such a terrific interviewer and the families are really to be commended for their openness and honesty in sharing their lives.

From a narrative standpoint, the best thing about this film is the absence of talking heads intercut throughout supplying statistics and editorial context to restrict the focus of the stories. Most viewers already know that medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy, so cutting away to insert that fact as evidence in advocacy of a public policy shift would maybe make sense but it would disrupt the interconnectedness of themes and diminish the texture of the families’ stories, deprive them of the full weight of all the ways that debt is felt.

"The video documents a journey into one of Thailand's most remote and isolated regions, the province of Nan, which lies on the edge of the Golden Triangle. The narrator, prompted by a call from a friend named Dennis, travels from Bangkok to Nan, a province rich in unique culture and history, significantly different from the bustling city life.

In Nan, the narrator visits Sila Lang, a village where Dennis's mother has lived for eight years. The village is incredibly remote, closer to four other countries than to Bangkok. The area has a sparse population and a distinct culture, once an independent state with a history of resilience against powerful empires.

The video explores the life of the local people, particularly focusing on a family running a homestay called Di Di. The family has adapted their way of life to cater to tourists, offering a blend of traditional and modern experiences. Bird, a member of the family, has combined Northern Thai flavors with Italian-style pizza, creating a local hangout spot.

The core of the journey involves foraging in the jungle with Bird's father, Khamon, a seasoned forager with knowledge passed down through generations. The video captures the challenges and rewards of foraging, highlighting the scarcity and value of puffball mushrooms, a rare and highly sought-after variety.

The narrator reflects on the contrast between city life and the self-sufficient, nature-reliant lifestyle of the mountain tribes. The journey culminates in a meal made from the foraged ingredients, showcasing the unique, fresh flavors of the local cuisine.

Throughout the trip, the video emphasizes the beauty and strength of the jungle, the resilience of its people, and the profound connection between the land and its inhabitants. The narrator's experience in Nan serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving such unique cultures and environments.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmbEdWQkNXc0NnUkZTQnoyZXVIa3Znc0Z2dG1Ibk1WQ2RQYWRWbHNtMktGc2FZRHZTRmVwdWJPVkMweVZUYzVRY3p0aDdoN0lZZ1NGTmZTUldTQy1uLXc9PQ==

Because he had already toured New Zealand, Australia and Europe, and was a pretty big deal in all those places. That's the part where the director was accused of misleading the viewer. Sixto already had a full music career, but he had substance abuse issues which would bring him back to Detroit. Plus, he really loved his home in Detroit. 


Before he passed away, I drove through the beautiful, historic neighborhood he lived in to see if I could find his house, and more specifically, that little window he poked his head out when it was revealed he's still alive.

"Just watched four good ones on a long haul American flight:

Closed for Storm - About New Orleans and hurricane Katrina from the view point of the newly opened Six Flags amusement park (which never reopened and remains a carcass 20 years later) 

The Boy Who Lived - Tells the story of Daniel Radcliff’s stunt double who was paralyzed from the neck down following an accident while filing the last two Harry Potter movies. This is such a great watch. Gives you a behind the scenes look at how they filmed the movies and amazing resilience and friendship. 

Lift - Follows a professional ballet dancer as he returns to his former homeless shelter in NY to teach kids ballet. Amazing story, fantastic dancing, and a super long timeline. The documentary takes place over several years so you can really follow the impact on the kids in the program. 

The Wall: Climb for Gold - Amazing documentary that follows four female rock climbers as they prepare for the Tokyo Olympics.

"I'm trying to remember the name of a documentary trilogy I watched some time ago... I would LOVE to find it because I'm a teacher and I think that would be a great example for one of the classes. Here are the details I recall:

1. **First Film**: A short film about when the filmmaker met his much younger lover... I remember scenes with a beach and a lovely sunset, the lover was beautiful, and if I'm not mistaken the filmmaker didn't know that they were going to become lovers yet.
2. **Second Film**: I don't remember many details about this one, i think it was a medium lenght film... but it focused on their relationship.
3. **Third Film**: This was a feature film where the couple was separating.. or about to break up. The entire film was basically a series of close-up shots of the lover just listening to a set of songs that the filmmaker had chosen for him, and reacting to them. One of the songs was by Leonard Cohen, but I can't remember which one.

All three films are documentaries, not fiction. The trilogy is from either the US or Europe, and it was centered around their relationship.

"Even though it was brewing right in front of our eyes for decades, this moment is still so alarming it’s difficult to really grasp: The GOP, one of this nation’s two main political parties, has been totally overwhelmed and captured, collapsed into extremism. All of the moderates are gone, all of the intellectuals are gone, all of the contests over control of the party platform and apparatus are over. Even during his presidency Trump and his loyalists still did a fair amount of fighting with other Republicans. Now they are alone.

Either way the election goes, the results are going to be another giant loyalty stress test applied to Republican and conservative-identifying citizens everywhere in the country.

"THE GREY AREA is the story of Keagan Anfuso, a young adult female who is more masculine than feminine. Since birth, her life has been heavily affected by antiquated definitions and stereotypes of gender in oppressive, strange, comical, and terrifying ways. Throughout the film, Anfuso shares her fears and insecurities caused by bullying and gender stereotyping, as well as her unique and surprisingly simple perspective on her place in today’s culture. Featuring re-enactments of Anfuso's experiences and interviews with other masculine women, THE GREY AREA helps viewers understand gender expression and how to support children, teens and adults to be themselves.

"I'll answer you 6 years later ha ha. I'm now an agnostic, but I grew up Lutheran and actually was a youth church camp counselor...albeit not like this wild documentary. To answer your question, I personally think it's not appropriate to teach children to follow one specific path when it comes to religion. I know that flies in the face of religion, but kids have no idea what to believe. If you do expose your child to your religion, you at very minimal need to be open to them not accepting it...and subsequently being okay with that.

"I play scratchers every week. $60.00 worth and it's 100% disposable income from my own personal allowance. Purely entertainment with the thrill of a payout chance.

I'm middle class and don't feel at all like I'm being preyed upon by the ""vicious lottery system"". I buy my lots every Friday and we scratch as a family.  I never go back for seconds despite winning or losing but I will say that the ""gamblers itch"" to go back does exist.

My feedback is that the comments here seem inaccurate based on my experiences with CA scratchers. I typically buy 1 x $30 card and the rest a combo of $1-$5 cards, about 10-15 cards total. I have had exactly 1 instance in 20 weeks where all my cards were losing cards. Some weeks I win as little as $10 but often I walk away between $20 and $30 (yes I know, not a great return). But I have also won $500 on a single ticket and other sums across the cards ranging from $50 to $150.

For the last 10 weeks I have not had to pull a single dollar out of my bank because I've been riding that $500 win plus what I get with additional weekly winnings.

Is the $10 Million payout a myth? Maybe. I'll let you all know if I hit it. For now I'll just say that it seems like there are a lot of non-players here making statements that just don't line up with actual. Or maybe I'm incredibly lucky and others are the opposite. Either way, good luck to you and yes it is gambling.

"It's one of those documentaries that you always see recommended on here and especially on /r/movies. Can I be the voice of dissent and say that it's not a very good documentary?

The story it tells is gripping and harrowing but it is told in a pretty sensationalist, almost exploitative way. It is crafted to tear at your heart strings, not to objectively put forth statements of fact. It gut punches you repeatedly then sucker punches you in to believing you've seen something special, something important, and something we should come away from asking questions. There's no entertainment here, so it must be art! 

But it's just a really sad story told with everything turned up to eleven, and little to no explanation given as to why or how the events that transpire occurred; no insight in to the mindset or motivations of the people involved; just that they did what they did and you're going to feel terrible about it.

It's years since I've watched it, and maybe I'm forgetting some of the finer points, I'm not sure, but that was the impression I came away with. Maybe it's because the movie is so hyped, and it always mentioned in comments as ""Prepare to cry, this will break you, but it's amazing etc.""

"It's essentially a mistress, as most are with married men.
But more so its an agreed up relationship. 

The money is the agreement that she won't tell the wife or try and take half your wealth, her beauty and company along with a sexual relationship.  
Although some of the older guys just want a companion. 

It can also lead to marriage or becoming a live girlfriend on the rare occasion. 

Mostly it will be a weekly or monthly allowance, and that will mean an agreed upon amount of meets.
Gifts are gifts and not in lieu of anything else.

Some get flown about and go on holiday together so it's intended to be closer to dating, but essentially all cards are on the table/you can have a relationship without the need/expectation to fall in love.

My guess is it developed naturally from gold digging women. 
Atleast with this agreed at the start of a relationship, the guy isn't second guessing his girlfriend intentions just to steal his money.

"I first heard about bitcoin when a friend at my dorm told about it. I think that the price was around 5 cents at the time, in the 2000's.

I still believe that it's all a scam, and I'm happy about not funding that massive waste of energy, but...

The downside about crypto is that you never know when the trap shuts, and the stakeholders decide that it's time to cash in.

Expect to get screwed by those who hold enough of the currency to control the market price. Most of the people who engage in it lose, because they are at the mercy of those who hold enough of the coins to control the market value.

Why are we paying people thousands of dollars for burning energy that could have been useful, just to get a different way of transferring money? No actual value is generated, but energy is spent...

Why some think that this is a good thing is beyond me. It's inefficient. The energy use of crypto is pointless.

"RFK Jr doesn’t pass the sniff test for the same reasons as Trump or Prince Andrew. 

https://newrepublic.com/post/179637/robert-f-kennedy-jr-jeffrey-epstein

Kompromat is the age old Russian technique of using the weak bellend of a powerful family and holding something over him that makes him your pawn.  Just like trump.  Just like Prince Andrew.  Just like Musk and Weinstein, Jordan Peterson, Johnson, McConnell, Graham and a dozen others. 

But track those commonalities in reverse and you can reverse engineer the methodology. 

1.	⁠⁠RFK Jr has been on Epsteins jet. When you are fighting cancer you can’t leave any behind. So whether it is innocuous or not, you err on the side of caution.  There are 336 million people in this country and roughly half of those hit the  legal qualifications to be president.  

99.999% of those never crossed paths with Epstein.

Why do we keep putting people on the podium who had contact with the Ronald McDonald of Russian Kompromat, major financial fraud and pedophilia? 

2.	⁠⁠RFK Jr.  just tapped Sergei Brins ex wife (that Musk had the affair with) as his running mate which is probably because she comes with basically unlimited Google money.

But that means a DEEP dive into Google and Brin to decide if it’s 100% clear of Russian influence or not. Because everything is on the line. 

On google:

Sheryl Sandberg was at Google before she was at Facebook. The common denominator of both was her ad based business model.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-07/sheryl-sandberg-s-legacy-is-an-internet-of-targeted-automated-ads

https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/sheryl-sandbergs-advertising-empire-leaves-a-complicated-legacy/amp_articleshow/91961682.cms

The problem with ad based business models is that if you raise your lens high enough, whomever can afford to buy the most ads is effectively able to buy their curated version of reality.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ukz0G-D5zA&feature=youtu.be

When google IPO’ed it shifted from what was most accurate to what was most profitable, all facilitated by a proprietary algorithm so nobody gets to see the man behind the curtain.

Now we are 20 years down what is effectively a divergent reality. 

 It works…until it doesn’t.

Now our divergent reality is so far off the rails It creates mental illness, anxiety and depression because the 6 million year old source code in your brain knows that conservation is more reasonable and sustainable than consumption when there are one planets worth of resources, it just isn’t very lucrative to someone that needs you to keep buying something to keep them in billionaire status. In this case it’s oil. Russian and Texan owned oil but their streams cross just north of Jerusalem.

Facebook was basically designed as a delivery device for Russian/Israeli Psyops and malware. SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, Palestine, Ukraine, NSO, etc are all the downstream of Sheryl Sandberg.

Les Wexner, Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, Sandberg, and Zuckerberg all carried water in conducting the NSO/Pegasus spyware operation INCONUS that was feeding intelligence to both the israelis and, by extension, the Russians so there is far more crossover between the Israeli mob/ government and Russian mob/government  than shows at the surface.

Abagail Koppel was sent by the Jewish state to marry Les Wexner

YLK fund (Abagails father) made up $46.7M of Epsteins money

Wexner claimed it was stolen from him but not until after someone asked.

Wexner was notoriously litigious but wouldn’t sue Epstein.  Why?

Because PROMIS spyware was Robert Maxwells deal before Ghislaine and Epstein started their thing.

"absolutely. It's laughable - if you look at the early investors in bitcoin, they're all big shots in Silicon Valley - and people talk about how bitcoin liberates the average joe lol.

also, no crypto bro has ever solved the fundamental issue: no government, least of all the US government, will ever accept bitcoin on a large scale as the currency for paying tax. So even if bitcoin was widely adopted, you would still have to convert it at some point to dollars or euros to pay your income, corporate, capital gains tax - and at that point the government can just easily shut it down (as they have been doing, just ban or severely restrict the financial exchanges).

‘In July, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that “There’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to “resist” CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.

“I see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,” Kennedy said.

That same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared “IF YOU’RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN’T PAYING ATTENTION.”‘

"The FBI still thinks she's alive and had plastic surgery to alter her appearance. They increased her reward from $250,000 to $5 million in 2024. It's odd that the FBI is still after her in spite of Europol dropping her from their most wanted list without explanation.

But, I agree with you that she is dead. And the rumor that organized crime in Bulgaria got rid of her so they wouldn't be implicated in their part of the scam seems the most logical conclusion. If they were able to obtain just $1 billion of the $4 billion she scammed, they would be very happy. The $5 million reward offered by the FBI should make someone come forward if she were alive. There are no takers for the reward because those who were close enough to her to turn her in know that she is dead.

"**Main info on the doc:** Hi doc watchers, I'm Mitch! After years of medical turmoil without a diagnosis, a new documentary titled Bend or Break about my bonkers journey to get one and my subsequent efforts to make sure no one in the future goes through what myself and others did, was recently released for free on YouTube! There is a trigger warning because there are emotionally heavy moments/topics from my past including suicide that are discussed (especially at the beginning), but I promise it has a happy ending!

But don’t take it from me, as Mayo Clinic is the latest institution to post about the value of taking the time to watch, through their short blurb they included as entry 2/third paragraph in their article “**4 Must-See Documentaries on \\[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome\\] EDS/HSD**.”

"**Additional info for those interested:** Four universities in Ontario (I can link a relevant article below) have requested and been approved to add the film to their curricula to raise awareness about invisible and chronic illnesses/disabilities (those of us Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome look healthy at first glance), and it’s picked up several awards at various film festivals. The professors often ask me to visit and talk to the students after to spread awareness to the next generation! It was even being distributed to Ontario’s healthcare professionals through the University Health Network (UHN) and so many doctors have told me they have a better understanding of how to help their patients with rare and even invisible illnesses after watching. CNN also caught notice and asked for a shorter 5-minute interview which also includes 4 others with this condition. If you do take the time to watch this doc yourself, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

"Climbing is a sport that tests physical strength and mental control. It is a high-risk sport that requires the proper climbing techniques and equipment to stay safe. Despite the risks, climbing's popularity has exploded in recent years. It has transformed from a highly specialized niche sport to one that is accessible and mainstream.

Partly fueled by the rise of indoor climbing gyms, more people than ever before are out on cliffs and crags enjoying climbing. It's no longer just for the experts. However, these ""experts"" or ""Stone Locals,"" or long term rock climbers that make up the core of the various climbing communities, are now dealing with the sudden popularity of their sport - and the way of life.

Their interwoven stories are unique and diverse, but what is clear is they all have an increasingly important role as the unofficial anchors of the industry, carrying the responsibility of teaching others about rock climbing.

Daniel Pohl is a German boulderer and artist who created Avalonia, a climbing sanctuary in Germany. It is a magical place he freely shares with other climbers. He lives within its caves and crags as with sculptures that pay tribute to fallen climbing comrades. A staunch environmentalist and helpful climbing guide, Daniel embodies how you become one with nature when climbing.

Family is also an essential aspect of climbing. In Salt Lake City, the Keithley's, a climbing family, have made it their mission to educate new and reeducate old climbers on climbing techniques and safety and how to give back to the climbing community. They organize clean-up drives, rebolting climbs and more, ensuring climbers will stay safe and involved.

Katsuka ""Jumbo"" Yokoyama, a climbing legend for over 20 years, contemplates his passion for climbing while home in Japan. He has conquered some of the most intense alpine climbs in the world and many first free (no gear) ascents in Japan. Now a husband and father, he works through the risks associated with climbing and his love for his family.

In Kentucky comes the touching story of Dario Ventura, who, with his father, Miguel, owns the world-famous climber's campground and haven Miguel's Pizza. They are true pillars of the Red River Gorge climbing community and forever grateful and touched by the love and support given back by the same community - an extended family of sorts - when his daughter battled a life-threatening liver disease.

Finally, Kathy Karlo, the first female to complete the Tennessee Wall Triple Crown ascent and host of the popular podcast ""For the Love of Climbing."" Her advocacy is inclusivity in climbing and to spark conversations about life. Her journey to find healing from a traumatic event intersects with her passion for climbing, highlighting how it's just you, your mental fortitude and the wall which you must climb to survive.

Though climbing as an industry is going through many changes, the future looks optimistic as long as climbers have a passion for the sport and are willing to embrace it as a way of life despite the risks and because of its rewards.

"Yes, this is a good one for sure. It really kind of reminds me of the old farm house my family lived in in the early 70s. And the way Darlene treats her kids is awful, in my opinion, but honestly that's the way most kids were treated & raised back then. It's like we weren't even human, the old 'they're just kids' line comes to mind. My parents used to embarrass me so much because they would talk about money problems and all the dirty details in front of me, my siblings, and our friends who would be there! They didn't care, it's like they took us all as deaf dumb & blin, and that talking about very personal things in front of kids was perfectly fine! As an adult I rarely ever talked about my childhood/my past because I was so ashamed, I felt embarrassment & shame, even though it wasnt my fault.. By the time I was 12 I had been to 15 different schools! We were dirt poor most of the time, my parents were on welfare. I believe they both suffered from serious mental health issues like depression for one. They weren't addicts or drinkers, but were cigarette smokers. I know I had serious depression as a young teen too but of course no one would ever dare talk about such things back then. Hell, we never dared to even talk about emotions, period!

Within the realms of performance art, Marina Abramović is undoubtedly one of the most celebrated and controversial female artists yet known. Her work has captivated and shocked many for its intensity, its rawness, and its willingness to push the boundaries of human endurance.

Although she began her career as a painter, in time she would turn her attention to performance art in the early 1970s where she would start exploring themes of the body, pain, and trauma. She often put herself in extreme physical and emotional states, testing the limits of what her body and mind could withstand, as well as how the viewing public would interact.

Over the years, Abramović has continued to create challenging and innovative work. She has performed in some of the world's most prestigious museums and galleries, and her work has been featured in numerous films and documentaries and continues to do so to this day.

In this video, we will be taking an intimate look at Abramović's life from her early childhood to the woman she is today. As well discussing her work from the rarely-heard-of to her most infamous, in hopes to understand what drives her to create such extreme and challenging art.

Just how exactly has Marina Abramović become such a complex and fascinating figure? How did she become a pioneer in the field of performance art, and how has her work challenged and inspired audiences for decades? 

This is the story and performance art of Marina Abramović.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR1U2h4NEcxZkVrY1RmRGNfQ29vY0N6V1pJNHRhRzlZZ2hFQVI0ZWotSkxybmtmVlJLTEJZNHZmTVZDRU1JdW1LdHhsY25QSUhTdDBDcU1ra0g1YUQ2cEE9PQ==

"It’s worth pointing out that her primary audiences—her clients, as it were—are institutions and institutional functionaries. More specifically, those cultural organizations (schools, galleries, museums, publications, etc.) that work as advocates of modernism. 

Which is to say that if you are seeing her or documentation of her events at a museum, it is because she has found a way to give the *museum* exactly the sort of programming it wants. Everybody hopes the ticket-buyers and critics love it too, but first and foremost it must satisfy the operational, ideological tastes and values of the organs of cultural power that are promoting her as an example of mondernism. If somebody can do all of that *and* draw crowds then you’re going to see more and more of them over the years.

And museums are notoriously risk-averse.

"From the Earth to the Moon is a 12-part 1998 HBO television miniseries co-produced by Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Tom Hanks, and Michael Bostick, telling the story of the Apollo program during the 1960s and early 1970s in docudrama format. Largely based on Andrew Chaikin’s book, A Man on the Moon, the series is known for its accurate telling of the story of Apollo and the special effects under visual director Ernest D. Farino.

The series takes its title from, but is not based upon, the Jules Verne science fiction novel From the Earth to the Moon. Hanks appears in every episode, introducing each of the first eleven. The last episode is represented in a pseudo-documentary format narrated by Blythe Danner, interspersed with a reenactment of the making of Georges Méliès’ film Le Voyage dans la Lune. Hanks narrates and appears in these scenes as Méliès’ assistant.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQyaDVHNmIxQzhpZGtpV0hSS3EzbDBrdW1RYjhRRmxNYlR1cnpGbzljMVYxY2taZXptcGxGZ01XZ081WUs1dHBtOFo2UmxiakpZWk1Ra2JMV1NrX3pzbHc9PQ==

While weeping he talks about how he shot a woman holding what he thought was a gun, but then he realized it was actually a baby and then he says that this rage just came over him and he started just killing anyone he could find.

"It's nonfiction if that is what you are asking. But it goes in depth on what it was actually like on the ground in Vietnam and how the US troops and higher-ups viewed Vietnamese civilians as essentially worthless and thus okay to kill, rape, torture, etc. It of course shares real stories from the war but also gives an overview of the US occupation.

"> Upon release, the film and its source material came under controversy due to inaccuracies and falsehoods alleged by Mitnick against Shimomura and the screenwriters. The film's producers faced a lawsuit from author Jonathan Littman, who alleged that portions of the film's screenplay were taken from his book The Fugitive Game: Online with Kevin Mitnick. As such, the film was not released in the United States until September 24, 2004, where it was released direct-to-video by Dimension Films.

"It is written and directed by the best friend of the man it's about. The actions also transpire while he's creating the documentary, so it makes sense that everything seems to be turned up to 11, as it's all happening in practically live time. The emotions are very real for everyone involved in the documentary. When things turn, it's unexpected as that wasn't the initial direction of the documentary.

"All great points, and I didn't meant to suggest that emotions of the subjects of the doc were exaggerated or anything like that.

I suppose my main issue with the doc is that it should serve as a definitive summary of the case, because the guy making it is inherently biased. Yet so many who watch it take it as such, and indeed it really seems to present itself as such at times.

Not to defend the actions of the wife (sorry I forget her name) but are these the actions of somebody who is just purely evil, or a deeply disturbed, seriously mentally ill person? Likely some combination, I don't know. 

But the doc doesn't really explore that. She just presented as evil incarnate and not much is done to address the fact that maybe the system let her down just as much as it let down the people she killed.

Maybe it would be dangerous and irresponsible for an amateur filmmaker to tackle those subjects? I'm not sure. But ignoring them in favour of ""she's just a monster"" seems just as irresponsible.

Or maybe it does and I'm forgetting? Like I said, it is years since I watched it, but that was the impression that I had afterwards.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVBUHYtSUJKTVZVcWJlNDdobEJOWlo1Ylk4S0xyTlJoTDFLVXM0QzgyTVZ1Vk5PWUxzLV9rTjJXODc1OENqMDdRNGVGenpfcmFCdHVJYlhmOGJiSWg1cEE9PQ==
"I totally understand where you're coming from. It does touch on her past, including the fact that she had 2 or 3 other children that she abondoned (summarized from the doc). But you're correct; this is coming from a biased perspective. I do feel like he did an amazing job still stating the facts in present time as they transpired. 

The purpose of the documentary wasn't to look at her, her past and her motives. It was intended to be a video letter to a son from his father via all of his loved ones. It just happened to morph as she did what she did. He admits in the beginning he didn't know what would come of the videos and stories he was collecting. He didn't know how it would end. 

Maybe someday someone will take a deeper look at her as a person to see if there was something more going on. I'd definitely watch it.

"Submission statement:

A groundbreaking documentary directed and produced by Andrew Jarecki and produced and shot by Marc Smerling (the Oscar nominees behind 'Capturing the Friedmans').

The story delves into the strange history of real estate heir Robert Durst, long suspected in the still-unsolved 1982 disappearance of his wife as well as the subsequent murders of family friend Susan Berman and neighbour Morris Black. 

It features an extended, revealing interview with Durst himself, with whom Jarecki developed a unique relationship following the release of 'All Good Things', 'Jarecki's 2010 feature about Durst's life starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. 

'The Jinx' results from nearly a decade of research by the filmmakers, who expose police files, key witnesses, never-before-seen footage, private prison recordings, and thousands of pages of formerly hidden documents.

"Yes, the producers caught it during post-production (years after it happened) and immediately contacted the authorities. At the time they turned over the evidence, the producers were told that they were now witnesses and shouldn't talk to anyone because any public statements they made could become a problem when or if they were called in to testify. And they listened to and followed that advice.

LA was busy getting their case together and didn't want to risk letting Durst know they were on to him until they had to. The prosecutors and FBI had all the information, but they needed to put a solid case together and couldn't afford to jump the gun. Although, Durst didn't go on the run until the second to last episode aired when he realized he was caught with the notes, but he was being watched, just not very well. When the FBI lost track of Durst and realized he had gone on the run, they fast-tracked their prosecution plans. (Remember that he got off for killing and dismembering a neighbor in Texas and didn't want to risk him getting off a second time, so LA was taking a page from the DOJ and not charging/arresting until they were certain they'd get a guilty conviction.) The LA prosecutor immediately got a warrant for his arrest and that was what they used to detain him.

Durst was probably a day away from making his escape to Cuba when he called his voicemail and the FBI phone tap picked it up and traced the call back to a hotel in New Orleans. He happened to walk into the hotel lobby the same time the FBI agents (I think, could have been US Marshalls) were at the front desk asking about him. The timing of the arrest was coincidental and based on Durst running, not something manufactured by the producers and Jarecki as some people claimed.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVCY1pOdGdNUk0ta0U4YTUwYVpIWHF6dF9Oc3BkTkI5TXM3WU9KcE5pa0Y1Si1RRk1xRWFUbkpIb0NzdDNmYWtmWTlxODFZb0JwdGQ0YXU4VWI0YTdPNkE9PQ==

"I had thought so too! But it is not so. The spelling, Kiev, was an effort of Russification to make Kyiv appear closer to the Russian conforms. Russification in general was a policy to assimilate all Russian controlled territories to adopt Russian culture and language and not to use their own. A conscious effort to eliminate peoples culture. But the preffered Ukrainian spelling of their own capital is Kyiv, as it relates better to their own language. And Kyiv became recognized by the whole world as the proper spelling. But pro-Russian outlets continue spelling it as Kiev, the subtext being to essentially say Ukraine is not truly independent or its own thing and is instead a Russian territory. Which is why, (with the context), I am now choosing to spell it Kyiv. Isn't it interesting how such a seemingly small and inconsequential change on paper to a four letter word has so much history and can draw political lines on its usage? Anyways!

If you have paid rent or a mortgage since 1991 you have been paying into a rigged casino.

In 91 when the Soviet Union failed a handful of what in 1987 would have been known as бандит “bandits” rebranded themselves as “Russian oligarchs” because they had just stolen $1.4 Trillion worth of everything during the collapse of the USSR and needed to get it out of Russia before they got caught by a government that was in the process of ceasing to exist.

Most of them moved through Ukraine to Cyprus, London and then New York where they began using casinos to launder their stolen money and turn it into dollars as the Cold War…ended?

https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-casinos-could-not-make-atlantic-city-great-again/

The mass of $1.4T was just too great and broke the casinos.  Trumps right hand man and lobbyist Roger Stone saved his life and pulled him off an Augusta 109A helicopter carrying his 3 casino execs that started asking why their casino books were written in Russian.

2 pilots died too. NTSB report says it was a blade root seperation and created an A.D. (airworthiness directive) about it. But it didn’t really show up in any other A models which is curious for a manufacturing defect. It’s more the kind of fault that happens when someone with a diamond ring climbs the inspection steps and scores the top of the composite fiber blade root with the back side of their much harder Stone. Helicopters are vulnerable there. 

The Russians money laundering was so consumptive that when the casinos couldn’t keep up with their volume the bandits were forced to shift to buying commercial real estate instead. The talented Mr. Epstein and Mr commercial real estate himself Donald J Trump were the Russians new best friends. And coincidentally they were all roommates at trump towers along with Stones business partner Paul Manafort.

When your primary objective is to turn stolen rubles into clean USD before the law catches up with you, time is not a luxury you enjoy. You don’t negotiate a better deal on your new house or apartment complex.  In fact it’s ideal if you pay 2-4X the asking price because that’s half as many transactions you need to do.

Time is of the essence when volume is your problem. You can even start selling  houses to your buddy who then sells them back to you and you pass the difference under the table.

But if you are an average blue collar American belt buckle making working wages in the same market, when you go to run comparables for your new starter home, they come back artificially inflated by 200-600%.

So now whether you are renting or buying, YOU are effectively paying 2-6X what is fair.

And if your mortgage happens to be part of a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), then you are paying that money to the very same people that made certain to convince you that your home is your savings account because they make a higher percentage to sell you an expensive loan and then again to sell your mortgage in a fat bundle to the CCP.

In simplest terms it’s like artificially over ripening a piece of fruit by pumping it full of Koch Bros fertilizer.

Fat, juicy, and nearly falling off the tree.

Completely inorganic and highly toxic just like most of the PFAS runoff the Koch bros chemical plants produce, but it looks great in the Zillow ad.

And this goes on for 17 years until 2008 when the tree collapses under the weight of all its inorganic fruit. That was by design. The banks got the bailout and won both ways. The taxpayer who also happens to be the mortgage payer lost both ways.

$4 trillion was drained out of pension funds, 8 million people lost their jobs and 6 million Americans lost their homes.

It was the evolutionary precursor for what it happening now.

The Cold War never ended.  It just moved into Wyoming, Bozeman and Sun Valley as Russian oligarchs started buying up everything in sight with their stolen money.

Billionaires are an invasive species, and just like the Russian olive trees and tumbleweeds,  they consume the resources that choke out the local species to extinction

Energy is neither created or destroyed. Just rearranged.

And when it gets rearranged into a billionaire oligarchs pocket, you are left with the bill.

They don’t want you as neighbors.  They don’t want you as friends.  They want you out of their trillion dollar view from the deck of their new mansion where they rape your children in the middle of Teton National park.

What do you buy the Russian bandit that already owns everything?

You buy them Kelleys parcel in the middle of Teton National park so they can build a retirement mansion on it that they come to twice a year, ski at their private ski area, rape some children, and cosplay their Yellowstone fantasy.

Once you realize that, as John McCain put it- the Russian government is a gas station run by the mob, you realize that they have bred in psychopathic disregard for humanity as a feature, not a bug.

They are feeding on you from both sides and they have proven by the collapse of the Soviet Union that they don’t stop until every last bit of energy is drained out.

There is a reason nobody wants to live in Russia and the only people that ever snuck across the iron curtain from west to east was Lee Harvey Oswald.

Lev Parnas (guilianis point man in Ukraine) was tasked with using burisma to make Hunter appear kompromised.

https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/20/ron-johnson-did-russias-bidding-on-biden-lev-parnas-tells-congress/73043736007/

There is certainly no reasonable world where Hunter as a (recovering) addict is worth $50k a month as a board member or counsel to the gas company. But he was certainly worth a kremlin attempt at a Kompromat operation. Same methodology as Epstein used on Prince Andrew, Bill Gates and Bill Clinton. Pick a durpy calf off the edge of the herd and use it as camouflage to get deeper. Exert leverage as necessary.  

https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeffrey-epstein-bill-gates-affair-russian-bridge-player-8b2022ff

The kremlin needed trump back in office to keep their money laundering through Ukraines oligarch class from showing itself.

Effectively the laptop is Guilianis work with hunters named signed on top.  Kolomoisky, Dubinsky, fuks, derkach, Smirnov were the same players the kremlin was using for the money laundering

https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-alexander-smirnov-admits-russian-intelligence-behind-biden-bribery-claim2024-2

They knew the record showed the collusion so rather than trying to hide that they just put hunters name on it instead and handed the file to the GOP via Smirnov as a confidential informant claiming it was from Ukraine. 

GOP congressmen just never checked the veracity of it before they just took it to congress. Russias “useful idiot” play worked…until it didn’t.

Same players. Same methodology:

Sabre was trump hotels credit card processor.

Wirecard was a Russian intelligence operation

When the two signed a strategic partnership trump literally handed the Russian mob/intelligence the credit card details of every one of his own customers who ever stayed at a trump hotel.

It was the biggest online data breech in German history.

Everything is for sale for trump.   From the steaks to the shoes to his customers credit card details. His husk of a soul is no different. There is nothing inside of Donald trumps heart except psychopathic personality traits and Russian Kompromat 

Normal people just grossly underestimate these parasites greed.

He does that to everyone. He’s been blowing up my phone for two days from another a text now number after I blocked him and it’s at close to 100 messages.

"I was going to suggest the Queen of Versailles which, to my recollection, doesn't have any dramatic reenactments in it.


Filming started with the intention of covering the story of a new money kind of family and their building of their new home in Florida, based on the castle Versailles in France. The patriarch acquired their wealth through selling time shares which is a key detail, considering filming took place in 2008. The documentary ended up capturing the mortgage crisis and subsequent economic collapse through the lens of a wealthy family, a business that relies heavily on mortgages, and how these individuals who are well-meaning if not perhaps out of touch navigate all the nuance of it all.


I watched it not _too_ long ago, because there's actually a musical in Boston now based on the documentary. I didn't know how it would translate to a stage play, much less a musical, but it ended up working much better than I'd expected.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVEVnE4MWpmeFFxSmtxNkJXcG5tTTRyMkJLWkk0TE5WNG9hWnpCN09SZWlZUDJaUVV4TVRITFJUT0k2TlBNQ2V0VDVHM0hBdjZmNXQ2bnk4VHlGN2dyYnc9PQ==

"Two great ones. Dark Days is an incredible documentary that follows an unhomed community living in the Amtrac tunnels in NYC - it's super well done, black and white, and most of the soundtrack is Endtroducing by DJ Shadow. 180Degrees South is about a guy retracing a trip to Patagonia that the founds of The North Face and Patagonia took in the 60's. It's got climbing, surfing, a little bio on the founders of said company, and the soundtrack is mostly various Modest Mouse tracks.

"Check this out- talk about insane.

First, Durst technically died an innocent man. It’s a little technical, but a defendant’s guilt isn’t written in stone until all appeals have been exhausted. As much as I hate to admit it, this is why all the MAGA people are saying Trump isn’t technically a felon yet. They’re sorta right.

Okay, but here’s something I caught in the most recent series, Jinx 2, I think.,

The opening sequence shows how Durst was found and arrested. There may be a reason this part was left out of the original series, as it shows a possible wiretap violation that led that ego driven DA to where Durst was.

So, my qualification for this is I’m a retired phone company flunky. Twenty years at SWBT/SBC/AT&T. About ten of those years I was a field technician. All through the 90s. So, all landline stuff. Also all analog. Landlines are analog. Back then, when the police got a court order to live monitor a suspect’s phone, if it was in the area I worked, I would be the tech tasked with going to a “terminal” and installing a “range extender” on the suspect’s wire. A terminal is a cross box in the field where a bunch of cables come together. A range extender was a small device that enabled cops to listen to conversations.

Okay, so knowing how the telco network works, I know that a court order to listen to live conversations would only allow law enforcement to monitor conversations on one particular number. If one person calls you, and they’re monitoring you, and you answer, law enforcement is authorized to listen to you. The person that called you is incidental. Their number does not have a court order. But because you’re talking to them, regardless who called, that’s legal. If you forwarded your phone to someone else’s and answered a call placed to your number, but you answered on the phone it’s forwarded to, cops can’t listen.

Now, think about how voice mail works. When you call someone now and don’t get an answer, that call is forwarded to another number, which is not your number, and law enforcement doesn’t have a court order to monitor that.

So, while at a hotel in New Orleans years ago, Durst, on the run and phone tapped, he goes to a pay phone in the lobby, calls his own tapped cell number to retrieve any messages (you know where I’m going), the call is automatically forwarded after 4 or 5 rings, then his voicemail picks up. Durst then hits whatever number it was to tell the system he’s about to check the messages, not leave one, and the system responds with “please enter your password.”

Remember, Durst is weird AF to begin with, so much so that he confesses to his tally whacker in the bathroom at one point. So you can imagine how this phone call might sound. Anyway, he hits 9 to prompt the password prompt, then enters the wrong password. Again, Durst. He then quietly utters some cuss words, obviously mad about not remembering, then tries a few other times, uttering to himself the entire time. Meanwhile, he wasn’t talking to himself. There was a detective back in Los Angeles listening the to every word.

The detective identified the voice as belonging to Durst, then asked a judge for an arrest warrant and got it and the rest is history.

But here’s the thing. The moment Durst’s call to his own number auto-forwarded to the voicemail system, that is a call from one number (pay phone) to a not Durst number (cell phone voicemail), which the detective had no authority to monitor.

Imagine that.

So you know, after everything changed to digital in the mid 2000s, the technology for how cops listen completely changed. But the law hasn’t. At least not this much. Court orders for wire taps are very strictly only for your phone number, not you. If enough evidence exists to get an order, it doesn’t say cops can fish or target every method of communication you use. Every physical method, like someone else’s phone. Or a random pay phone you just happen to be in front of. If Durst had answered his physical cell phone that night, that’s a legal listen. But that’s not what happened. That detective didn’t have an order on the pay phone or system number, and Durst’s flip phone didn’t have an on-board answering machine.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVEWllIdmw1R291b04tbjRaOXg2YUVMTXpzRzFOTV83MjBNVlpmRHowc0ZyaEJCTVk2NmtwY3lfTUQzSG9MRHpxSU5JeEFLUVZ6a25zYjNabVpEWXRRdXc9PQ==

"What I mean is that it's idiotic to talk about ""russificstion"" in the context of Ukrainian area language.

People spoke what they spoke by historical accident, and kiev has always been ""Russian""and that's got nothing to do with loving Putin.  But this ethno essentialism that the modern Ukrainian state is all about paired with azov and their love of ""Norse runes"" is definitely not convincing me of their lack of Nazi sensibilities.  That's all I'm saying.

"The Paris 2024 Olympics have led to the displacement of numerous students as universities and landlords prioritize short-term rentals for tourists over long-term housing for residents. This video highlights the stories of those affected, focusing on the disruptions to their education and daily lives. Additionally, efforts to clean up the city have resulted in the forced removal of homeless individuals, sparking outrage and raising ethical questions about the treatment of society's most vulnerable populations.  
  
High rental prices have become another significant issue, with the influx of visitors driving up the cost of living in Paris. Residents find themselves priced out of their neighborhoods, exacerbating the city's already critical housing crisis. We also address the looming threat of transport strikes, which could paralyze the city's infrastructure during the Games. Security concerns and the rise in racist incidents add further layers of complexity, questioning Paris's readiness to host a safe and inclusive event.  
  
Furthermore, we discuss other critical problems, such as construction delays and budget overruns, which threaten the successful execution of the Games and place additional strain on the city's resources and residents. This video essay aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the chaotic planning of the Paris 2024 Olympics, shedding light on the far-reaching consequences for the people of Paris and the broader implications for future host cities.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVXS1VHQmdUMVRDdGFzNW9Kcjl1YlJIczRFSG1VYVA0RG9UT3ZlWWdzQklBbmJGV3ZpNG96enh0cXYwaEpoeTIxS0Q3Z1JYaFJuMVNOVkl0WV9ZN2FSTUE9PQ==

"Finally got round to watching this and as a fellow sufferer, want to say thank you for raising awareness. As a child during the 90s in the UK, my mum knew there was something wrong but the doctors said I just had ""lax joints"". It was only after my diagnosis in my late 20s, due to living abroad and seeing private doctors as a literal requirement of my visa, that I discovered what this was. Some of my other family members have similar symptoms and it's brought them a lot of relief to know what they're dealing with. 

As you said in your doc, it's a mixed bag of emotions to find out you have an incurable disorder, but that it's not in your head.

"It is not true.  When you immigrate it is to study or to work, and in either case you need proof of funds that you can look after yourself.  The government doesn’t pay you to come here.  If you’re a foreign student you pay 8x tuition compared to a resident.

I am sure immigration has propped up property values.  Whether you are happy with thst depends whether you own a home.

Many immigrants come to work.  There is a tremendous number of Mexican farm workers under the temporary foreign worker program.  They make what would be a princely sum back home, despite being minimum wage, in jobs few Canadians would do or even have skills for.

Quite a few Indians come to study and also work service industry jobs.  Some get tied up with degree mill colleges, which give a shitty degree.  Some stay, some go back.  Back when I studied computer science (90’s) there were tons of Chinese students.  They paid way more tuition and even so were the ones running around in new Acuras.

Many immigrants buy businesses from retiring Canadians and carry them on.  The nearby berry farm now has a general store and a liquor outlet.  The people who run it wear turbans and work their ass off.  I have stayed in more than one sketchy motel run by brown people.  This is not a problem for anyone.

The line about uber workers or Tim’s employees has their finger on the point.  You can see the other side of this issue on /r/India and searching for Canada.

If you pay attention to the video, the real issue is the cost of living and in particular housing.  My son can save money staying at home.

"It's disingenuous to say that people's frustrations are specifically immigrants, as in people who go through the long process of legally immigrating. We've seen a huge influx of temporary residents in the form of temporary foreign workers (TFWs) and international students on top of increasing immigration and permanent residency status. These programs have, historically, been mutually beneficial to Canada and to the workers/students, but have been opened up to abuse and exploitation in recent years, hence the derogatory term ""Timmigrants"" (Tim Horton's coffee shops) that's been circulating online to refer to TFWs working in service industry jobs rather than strategic sectors where it has been historically useful.

Similarly, loopholes in international student rules have allowed international students to work more than ever, when they're supposed to be here to study, and several public colleges have thrown academic integrity and their reputation to the wind to take advantage of the cash.

Many pragmatic and politically moderate citizens want to see changes to immigration policy in Canada, to return to historical norms. Immigrants are not at fault here, it's bad government policy and exploitive business owners taking advantage of cheap labour. And in return, we get increased demand on housing, social services, and infrastructure, all of which are already heavily stressed.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVnclRCQmpBeWhkdUZzbHVWam5fS09ka2ZwMWp2THlaTkdwT1ZQNHVRekVGT3NOTDZ0ZlZvQ3ZiMVlTZi05ekxmX05WalF4cE9CallFekZFWHMwSnlYM0E9PQ==

"I think that if we're honest, there is only europe, turkey and maybe India who Share these values, the rest of the world is still very patriarchal.

Very few countries have both support for liberal democratic values, gender equality AND a population that can realistically emigrate.

The majority of countries with population excess (Africa / Middle east) also have regressive and conservative views on pretty much every topic.

I think that economic and social liberalisation brings prosperity but also lower birthrates. Which in turns creates countries that need immigrants and cannot afford losing people.

Just think about it, let's say that your ideal immigrants are British, French, Belgians or Dutch. But all of these countries have low birth rates and already themselves rely on immigration and would rather keep their people. And of course as a country transitions to a liberal democracy, the will to leave the country goes down too.

Also regarding ""from certain places"":

To me, a core value of the west is individual responsibility. You do not share the sins of your peers. So no matter where immigrants come from, as long as they share the values you mentioned, should be welcome.

"For decades Canada drew a diverse range of people from all parts of the globe, totalling under a quarter million during the 2010s. Today 75% of all immigrants are from a few rural provinces in India and China, totalling over 1.5M per annum. They exclusively live in enclaves of their own community, speak their native language, and do not assimilate. They are overwhelmingly coming as students, and are allowed to work while studying via an open work permit. Canada is the only developed country that issues open work permits to students and their spouses. They are also allowed to bring their children and have them all utilize public services and healthcare, and have their elderly relatives live with them on 10 year super visas. Just one school in a small town in Ontario generated a quarter billion dollars in revenues selling worthless degrees so their 'students' can focus on working to obtain permanent residency. While adding millions to the population, Canada has made no investment in improving public services or infrastructure, particularly healthcare. This has come with a massive increase in people seeking asylum.

Canadians remain pro immigration but what has happened post COVID is millions of desperate people chasing vanishingly few jobs while housing and rent and food prices skyrocket. It is a massive failure of policy at the provincial and federal level, which seeks to exploit these newcomers as a source of disposable labour. All the while wages have remained flat as the cost of living explodes. All this has led to a massive amount of anger, particularly towards our prime minister.

Before I became a dentist, I used to think the lack of reciprocity among nations with regard to recognizing dental degrees was protectionist bullshit (and I still *do* think that the US and Canada should at least practice selective reciprocity with certain countries). But then I worked alongside full-fledged Indian dentists who were enrolled in my school’s accelerated DDS program for foreign dentists. Some of them displayed *terrifying* levels of ineptitude and ignorance, and - while there were just as many among them who were at the *top* of our class - the fact that they were *all* already certified to practice dentistry in another country was outrageous. It showed me that India maintains essentially no minimum standard to practice dentistry and that the Indian dental education system is more like afterschool Tae Kwon Do - keep showing up and keep paying your fees, and you *will* get your black belt.

"Throughout history people, let's be honest people of Western European heritage, aka descendants of European immigrants, have used the same tropes to justify their bigotry towards people not born here.

Or people that don't share ""Christian"" values.

Examples such as:

1. We have homeless here. Help them first then allow immigrants in.
2. They're taking ""our"" jobs.
3. They won't integrate into ""our"" society.
4. This neighbourhood isn't white enough.
5. White people invented everything

All the above are things I've had said to me on quite a regular basis. And I was born here.

There's numerous amounts of other excuses to justify bigotry towards non-white, non-Christian, immigrants. The same people whose ancestors stole from First Nations and flooded Canada with almost zero restrictions. They had a system set up to hugely favour them and block anyone that wasn't white. These descendants of European immigrants are the same ones griping because they don't want to share the country at all.   
  
That's where the ""privilege"" thing comes into play, and it drives white folks nuts and they get all defensive when you remind them of their advantages over pretty well everyone else in Canada. But the facts are the facts, any history book will lay it out for those who choose to get off their ass and read one.

All you have to do is look at the huge uproar when the Syrian refugee thing happened a few years ago. And then compare that with Ukrainian immigration which was not so much of an uproar. There was some but people were losing their minds WAY more when the immigrants from Syria, fleeing war as well, were given an opportunity to come to Canada. Anyone with half a brain knows why - they just won't admit it.

Fact of the matter is that when some multi-generational native-born Canadians feel like their suffering the first group of people, they blame are almost always immigrants. They don't realize that immigration is a net PLUS to the country. Who's going to pay for their healthcare and fill voids in the workplace?

I know so many immigrants that have flourished and employ many others. They are far more proud and far more loyal to the country then the types that fly the Canadian flag upside down that think they're ""freedom"" fighters while blocking the streets of Ottawa. They're not leeches to society like the extreme right wing likes to portray them as. The vast majority of them have done very well for themselves and over time end up paying far MORE to the country via taxes than they ever take.

They're hardworking and willing to do what it takes to make Canada their home. Frankly, I think the people complaining about immigration need to get to work and quit spending money on tattoos, smoking, drinking, and complaining that they somehow got hard done by. Or just don't complain because if you live in Canada, you're extremely lucky - stats show Canada is a Top 3 place to live in the world.

And that's coming from the son of a family of immigrants that came here in the late 60s. I will ALWAYS be grateful I live here and am Canadian.

"Immigration has sky rocketed in 2023 I believe. I was looking at some numbers and for a decade our influx was always around 200k, in 2023 it doubled to over 400k.

I’m all about multiculturalism, but if we were discussing an American going to Japan and becoming a public nuisance, disrespecting the culture and being obnoxious a lot of the conversation wouldn’t turn in favour of the American, it would be discussing how it when in Rome do as the Roman’s. 

Renting conditions are disgusting. Driving in the GTA is congested, people drive so dangerously. Service quality for minimum wage jobs are down the toilet.

Also, it's not the lower classes that end up getting to come in the first place, it's typically middle or upper class folk. First world countries do only want the highly qualified candidates. Most of which have decent lives there, have to show funds in their bank accounts when they apply.

"Immigration is fantastic, if it's sensible - You pick the best and brightest, who have specific skills and experience you need more of and are unable to produce domestically for the time being, who are the most willing and able to assimilate into your culture, and who will bring the greatest value to society and the economy.

You should not treat immigration as a magic bullet to cure your own demographic challenges, nor should immigration be a tool to fill employment in roles the local labor market just doesn't want to do, nor should you expect little or no integration and assimilation from your migrants, they are there to become as the majority is, not the other way around, and you should not import more than you can easily support not just right now but 5 or 10 years down the road as their needs change

Also you probably should not treat migration as some sort of moral imperative to 'fix' your wickedly undiverse (read: white) population either... this creates resentment and taints all the great benefits of migration.

Western religions are exclusive and rigid.. 

Exclusive meaning either you are a Christian and good or you are not and bad.

Eastern people where most of the immigrants come from are incompatible with the core values of the west. The religions of the east are spiritual, secular, believe everyone to be on the right path regardless of their belief system.

Are we building the equivalent of that for every 230k immigrants we import? If not, there's your problem. They're destroying our quality of life for corporate greed.


If we want Canadians to support immigration, we need to have a standardized process. Where is this person going to live? Does this place have the infrastructure to support them? Once we meet a threshold, more infrastructure is REQUIRED, which creates jobs and supports our economy. The inherent problem is that such an idea means actually quantifying how far they've overshot.

"Cultural enclaves have always occurred throughout the history of human migration. 

Human beings are tribal by nature. “If you’re part of my tribe, I can trust you. If you’re not part of my tribe, I cannot trust you.” 

This mindset has served not just pre-historic humans, but nearly every species of animal on the planet. It’s instinctive. 

The problem this causes today (and in recent history) is when large groups of people (not speaking to any one particular group) who have a common tradition of violence, crime, vagrancy, hate towards other groups, illiteracy, destruction, etc, etc, etc. move en-masse to places where “better” traditions have become well rooted.

While individual people from these groups might migrate to a more prosperous land, assimilate the traditions that made that land prosper and go on to become prosperous themselves, a massive influx from the same group would tend to form enclaves, keeping the same traditions and habits that kept them from being prosperous in their homelands, while being distrustful of anyone from outside their enclaves.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoY2hnM2QwdVU4RUM5RFh5NHQyNTFoUWZkSm5rOEs5QzBFTU9XWFdNQ0dId3ZoNE41VnN0cmtnYU1sWGljTmNGY2xOUFlUWHlWdnVhQWd4NEttLVZ6TXc9PQ==

What explicit policy changes can you point to that couldn't also be explained by the advant of the internet, a decade+ long absense from the city, globalization or the numerous global changes?

Your move, so far, is vagueness. But you wanted to talk about this instead so please, instead of being vague, be specific in how immigrants have changed British culture across the entire country - as that was your claim.

Are Brits less tolerate of LBGTQ people now than they were 40 years ago? Do women have fewer rights? Are religious practices of white brits discouraged?

"Really if you're an immigrant in this day and age, you should absolutely be the sort of person who has the character and traits to adapt, to fit in, and to adopt the culture of your hosts. This idea that people are just incapable of anything other than sequestering themselves into ghettos and retaining everything about the place they came from such that they might as well have never left is stupid and pretty insulting, plenty of immigrants do things the right way. 

It's just unfortunate that quite a few western nations with huge intakes of migrants have allowed parallel societies to form, and failed to demand proper integration and assimilation.

"I gave my own lived experience and your response was essentially “no, you’re imagining it”, now that I’ve provided the statistics you seem to think that the cultures you can see have moved into London are identical (or even similar) to those that were there before. 

Do you actually believe that?

Crime rates are far higher now than they were before; monoculture countries haven’t seen similar increases, and I believe if our ethnographic profile hadn’t shifted so dramatically, we wouldn’t see the same change. Hard to prove though. 

We wouldn’t have grooming gangs of Pakistani men raping and abusing white children, as we’ve experienced multiple times in the UK, if we hadn’t imported millions of people from a culture who hold such little value on women and children’s rights. 

LGBT people would be safer and more welcomed in cities like Bradford and Birmingham, if large parts of them weren’t majority Islamic.

That’s not to say the country would be perfect or crime free - but it would unquestionably be very different, as was my original assertion. 

The thing is, we’re very early in this - the demographics will keep shifting and the proportion of native white British will keep shrinking. It’s not too bad right now. But when my children are adults - or my grandchildren - I truly believe the UK will be a much more right wing, dangerous place, because we’re importing people from right wing, dangerous countries, who are not integrating, in many cases even in 2nd and 3rd generations, and they’re breeding much faster than us.

"My analogy is perfectly fine. You simply disagree because I had the audacity to tell you to focus on measurable outcomes rather nebulous claims of ""culture.""

And yes, your lived experience is entirely valid to criticize. If you're secretly a white nationalist that bias would deeply color your interpretation vs if you were full-blown ultra leftist hippie would. I do not know you -- your claims of lived experiences cannot be used any more than my lived experiences could be; hence why you're not seeing me try and tell you're wrong despite living in Toronto Canada. We could use my lived experience as a qualifier if you like - it has greater validity than yours as the topic is Canada but I know that anacedotes aren't particularly valuable.

The London crime rate is up when measured in aggregate but it's mostly petty crime. Violent crime such as homicide is down by nearly 50% since the 1990s. The massive increase in non-violent crime we see occurring during the COVID lockdowns and subsequent years seem to be dropping to past levels. If you're not talking about violent crime - which kinds of crime are you specifically referring to?

The UK has had gangs for hundreds of years. Just because the immigrant gangs make the news doesn't mean homegrown gang problems are a lesser issue. If anything -- it would seem that gang violence has also dropped. So outside of your anaecdot here about Pakistani gangs; there seems to have been less gang activity over all.

What does ""more welcomed"" mean? What policy, action or stats do you have to support this claim?

You're repeating a lot of dubious claims that rely almost entirely on personal feelings or headline news rather than statistical backing. You still haven't named a single government policy fyi. At most you've got a few localized issues. Do you see now why I told you to stop this ""culture"" nonsense? When questioned on it you have literally nothing to back your opinion on. You have no policies. You have 0 stats that back the claim that UK culture has changed in 40 years. Don't you think it would be better to make a claim that you could back with actual information? Something that wouldn't rely on your personal bias to confirm?

PS: My country has far, FAR more immigrants per capita than yours does. 14% vs 23%. Nearly 66% more. So, perhaps, I have greater authority than you do to claim that higher % of immigrants do not shift culture as readily as you claim.

There are real, measurable & demonstratable issues with unchecked immigration that you could point to and use an anchor for your position. Instead you have decided to rely on this nebulous claim of ""culture"" because it's emotional, scary & lets peoples imaginations run wild. The problem with that is the moment you scratch at it a little bit it becomes apparant that 3 of the 4 claims made are backed by little more than ""trust me bro.""

That makes them bad arguments dude. Maybe, instead of culture, talk about job availability, housing, high skill job access, access to schooling, LGBTQ policy changes, policing actions, govt policy decisions or anything else that immigration in high numbers measurably impacts. You have TONS of options.

Instead you talk about ""culture"" because then anyone who agrees with you doesn't actually need to know anything to go ""yeah!""

We’ve had many examples of Islamic men grooming young white children, in large scale numbers: https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/opinions/2024/2/23/the-uks-grooming-gangs-and-the-lessons-never-learned

We’ve had many, many attacks, like this religiously motivated concert bombing which killed 22, many of which were children: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/27/brother-of-manchester-arena-bomber-appears-in-uk-court

Or how about the fact that almost all Muslims in the UK want to make homosexuality illegal? How safe do you think the LGBT community in those cities will feel when Muslims are inevitably a majority? https://amp.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality

These are cultural issues. You can say “culture doesn’t matter” or “culture isn’t important” but the issue is their cultural. Culture isn’t some made up thing you can just dismiss - you don’t want to talk about it because you know it’s hard to defend. It’s not going to get better. 

And saying “you can’t define how the country is different, so it isn’t different” is silly - I’ve shown you the stats. You know those cultures are different - so it has to have changed. It can’t be defined very easily - it’s not 64.7% different - but it obviously and inevitably is.

"edit upfront: answered the wrong person, and now I dont find his post. Sorry!

Sounds good on paper! But who is doing the basic labor work? Many young people avoid craftsmenship, or ""dirty"" jobs. They all pursuit collar jobs in a luxury office within a glass palace. Next, without the mass immigration, the economy of the country will collapse. native adult people dont get that many children (reasons are known), but all the old people are leaving, and there is not enough young ones to fill the gap.

Without a workforce, the social security will collapse. The problem canada faces, is the same europe suffers.

Like in germany, young people dont want to work in nursery, bakery, craftmen. They all study till the mid20's, and work as project manager or economic advisor (exaggerated). The Boomer generation lives off of pension, and Gen X start to leave the workfield. germany passed a law that allow to continue working after retirment. We are losing specialists left and right, and the young german people dont want to fill the gap.

And the reasons are simple: people dont avoid those workfield because they are dirty or demanding. They payment, together with cost of living, is abyssimal. middle class in germany for a single person start with 23k/yr. The middle class dropped so hard, that minimum wage is considered the lowest earning of the middle class bracket. Oh, numbers are pre-tax.

Immigration is needed, and can (and probably will and is) be abused as cheap workforce. This will only delay the problem which people are facing:  lack of income, high cost of living.

"No, like most people you just dont understand what Multiculturalism is. Multiculturalism is not the same as *multicultural*. The absence of multiculturalism is not a Monoculture. The USA, for example, is culturally diverse, but is not Multiculturalist, they are what we call Melting Pot.

Look, in Multiculturalism there is no integration. Immigrants are not expected to adopt the national identity of the host country, in fact they are encouraged not to. In Multiculturalism the host country just becomes a place for people from countries who *did* keep a national identity to live. The onus is entirely on the host society to make accommodations to the immigrant's various cultural practices.

"Some native born Canadians, white as snow, Christian, don't share the values you mentioned. Don't pin all your far-right, homophobia, and racism problems solely on immigrants. You have politicians and parties that hold the same negative views you're mentioning.

Who's banning books in schools and libraries? Trump got nearly 50% of the votes last elections, which represents roughly 160 million people who share those views. 

Look in Canada. A city fought tooth and nail to prevent a piece of land being designated as a Muslim cemetery. People were shot while praying in a mosque. A law is passed to stop Muslim women from getting promoted or getting a government job if they wear a hijab. It penalizes Seikh men in the same manner if they wear a turban. 

Look at the UK. Who's stopping cars asking them if they're white or immigrant? Who's burning libraries? Looting shops? Who's attacking minorities? 

The government brings people looking for a better life, but the economy and the infrastructure are not equipped to handle or offer them that. The reason why they huddle up in communities is because the government washes its hands of them once they land. No help, no advice, no assistance to help them integrate or assimilate, so they seek help from a community that understands their problems. 

Blame the government poor planning, not the people who come here legally. The government has no plans to prop up the economy other than by bringing in immigrants to buy houses at inflated prices, while it constantly fails to build more affordable housing, fix flailing infrastructure, address healthcare system problems, or do much of anything other than sit back and watch you take it out on immigrants rather than holding them accountable.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoQTZ0d3hVZnYzMGF5dGRNQmxZVGhzekZpSkNoWHF3Ulk4OUJ0VW5EaHBrNnZDZHd2WC04QjZYalN3SHVkcmxRemZFQS1HdkJUbXNkMkdBX29vcnE0MUE9PQ==
"Or, perhaps, I'm critiquing you on your vagueness - which you've finally started to address? You seem to be taking my critique and extrapolating that to mean that I won't ""hear you"" on the issues you raise.

I'm hearing you just fine. I'm just holding you to an actual standard rather than simply accepting your claims at face value. When attempting to get your to produce literally any verifiable fact that shows the impact of cultural changes that you claim are ""so obvious"" you seem to come up short.

I struggle to take people seriously that claim certain things are ""obvious"" but when asked for examples they struggle to provide any. You've now resorted to inventing my position and inventing quotes that I've never stated.

I will admit - it is a lot easier to win an argument with someone when you're arguing with yourself.

Lets take a look at your examples:

* The LBGT protests are the FIRST real example provided. I will not knock you for this one. I will however point out that these policies were also protested against 30 years ago by the same white christians that backed the group cited in your Birmingham example.  This, at last, is your first good example and is worth noting.

* Did you read that article critically? It deeply lacks substance. It cites one article from a decade ago and implies a lack of changes since that date but without offering anything beyond 1-off examples. Crime is a real problem. But we wouldn't claim that the Irish shouldn't exist in London because of the IRA. By comparison - British right-wing extremism is a substantially greater threat per your own security services.

* Yes, religiously motivated attacks are a modern world problem that we must contend with. However -- the very article you cite the IRA as more damaging than Islamic extremism. Additionally - it highlights how no matter the religion London/the UK has had consistent, ongoing issues for 40+ years with a variety of religions and terrorist groups.

That does not point to a ""cultural issue."" That points the fact that the UK struggles to combat extremism/terrorism no matter the source. Or, in short, you've done a good job of highlighting that bad people do bad things -- but you haven't actually shown that those people are making lasting cultural changes to the UK; which was your big, original claim.

Of everything you've claimed the 1 that actually IS CULTURE is the LBGTQ issue. Literally everything else cited simply isn't. Or, to reiterate my original point, you're citing something so nebulous that it can mean anything. What you've shown here with the links you've selected is that, when it comes to Islamic countries, you are willing to name every negative action as ""culture"" - no matter what it is. This is the problem with citing ""culture."" You don't even have a clean definition of what it is/what it incorporates for yourself.

PS: It does not HAVE to have changed. It has been challenged and, per the very article you've selected to share here, British modern culture won. It withstood the challenge to LGBTQ+ peoples rights and didn't budge.

If you believe you can find an example of a policy or decision that would have never occurred in the UK prior to immigration from Islamic countries I'd happily concede that point to you. But you've struggled to find that. Your best shot so far is an example of the opposite.

Call me crazy, terrible, naive or invent quotes for me all you want - you're not making a good case for your argument. Which, as a reminder, is why I told you not to make it.

You SHOULD have made an argument using the dozens of other entirely valid, measurable impacts that you could support without needing to rely on opinion pieces.

"We basically added another city of Ottawa (900k people) to the country in a single year. To put this into perspective, this is like the US adding the entire city of Houston every single year, or Germany adding a Munich every year.

Please tell me where do we send another City of Ottawa worth of people next year? And the year after that? 

Or do you think it is perfectly ok for newcomers to be crammed into a small house, shared with +10 other compatriots scraping by to pay rent and other basic expenses? Is this the Canadian Dream we are selling to new comers? It's bad on them too. They also deserve to reap the benefits that Canada CAN provide, but is increasingly UNABLE to.    

And let's not kid ourselves, a major driver for this absurd level of immigration comes from greedy corporations looking to supress wages by importing newcomers that are more willing to work for low wages than Canadian citizens or residents that are accustomed to living here. They are being exploited for cheap labour, and we all come out losing here while the corporations continue to enrich themselves and grow their hold on Canadian markets.    

As it stands, Canada is really only able to provide more security and better access to nature and some essential services than other nations. But that is about it. The cost of living and housing challenges and a colossal barrier that is only growing for every successive wave of newcomers.

We are importing a group of people that are increasingly vulnerable to this level of exploitation. This is NOT how the ""Canadian Dream"" is supposed to be.

That's a bizarre issue to have. Why shouldn't a society like the kinds of people it's allowing in? Your implication his is of course that it's racism but that isn't the issue being raised. It's that their are too many people period and that they aren't integrating into Canadian society.

>If it was the same load of white Europeans that have been immigrating for centuries, no problem.

Yeah, if it was people who are a closer cultural fit and have an easier time integrating it wouldn't be a problem. Again you make it racial when at it's core it isn't.

>How do I know? Because they don't complain about the centuries worth of white European immigrants.

Yes they do, you hear Canadian's express regret about what their ancestors did all the time.

"“I’m critiquing you on your vagueness.”

Fair enough. I honestly believe the UK authorities purposefully make it hard to be specific with statistics of these crimes, hence why the grooming gangs were allowed to attack white girls for so long - because the police were terrified of being accused of racism. 

For example, you said “per your own security services, right wing extremism is a substantially bigger threat”. This is the sort of thing I mean when I say it’s hard to be specific, because the authorities absolutely downplay the risks, exactly like that quote from our security services. Look at the list of attacks in the UK in the last 10, 15 years, and tell me which is a higher risk, the many, many Islamic attacks with multiple casualties, or the small handful of right wing extremists?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Great_Britain

It’s hard to be specific, because crime by immigrants is downplayed and minimised by the UK authorities. Right now the headlines in the UK are all about right wing protests and riots - which are reprehensible. But as disgusting as these are, it’s a small amount of property damage and some bruises. They’re in response to an attack by a second generation immigrant who stabbed several young girls to death last week - that attack was minimally reported compared to the current protests, it’s swept under the rug because the perpetrator was non-white and reporting on crimes by that demographic is avoided as much as possible here. 

So being vague is inevitable when facts are purposefully obfuscated and minimised.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoeFdDTVhnQ2lnYWhBZkVwczlUQm9jWGtYbWNkTks5ZXR1UXF5bV9YVzlRX05SV2N2QU80ZnNqa2R2bjVTSTVOTjJOaFN1Ql9hMUl2bHRYbjJUTXptblE9PQ==

I'll be real candid with you -- this sounds like you're starting with a conclusion then attempting to discredit anything that doesn't support that conclusion.

Crime stats and their reporting has been fairly standardized for decades. It's the same graphs, inputs & reporting. 

It's important to recognize that I'm not minimizing horrible events or dangers. I'm simply pointing out that I believe that media bubble you live in might be hyper-focusing on immigrant-crime; giving you the impression it's vastly more prevalent than home grown crime.

"“Police failed to properly target south Asian men over child sex crimes because it would have been “too politically incorrect”, an inquiry heard.

An investigation into child sexual exploitation in Telford also heard officers “dropped the case like a hot potato” when complaints were made against these suspects.

In his report, inquiry chair Tom Crowther QC said the majority of suspects of child sex crimes in Telford during the period he examined “were men of southern Asian heritage”.

However evidence was repeatedly ignored by both the police and council, he said, with the police in particular nervous about areas seen as “Asian areas”.”

"""US""/""Australia""/""NZ"", yes I agree I thought it wasn't necessary to mention.

Latin Americas, I don't know enough about it, you are probably right, they seem to be cultural descendants of spain/portugal.

Korea/Japan. I am korean and studied in Europe. And I can tell you that we have a very different culture and world view. Western values are based on an indvidualistic view of the world (which is on what liberalism is built). Whereas ours are based on confucianism. It implies many differences (I can write a longer post tomorrow to share my experience regarding that if you are interested).   
  
 Moreover, this comment thread is about women, and our country is extremely patriarchal. There are currently serious social conflicts around the fight against the patriarchy, and many men and older people do not want to accept the such ""western value"" (as described above).  


>  
Plus why do people seem to think only impoverished people from third world countries ""deserve""to immigrate?

It's not about deserving, I suppose that you misread or misunderstood, can you point in my post where you believe that I talked about deserving?

I am talking about the ability a country has to lose people. Japan and Korea are currently famous for a population crisis (Europe too), such countries cannot afford leaking people.

The only countries who have a birth rate that allows emigration (not immigration) happen to be poor developing countries. They aren't source of immigrants because they ""deserve because they are poor"", they are source of immigrants because they are the few places of the world with high birth rates.  
  
And I don't think it will last long anyways, as they develop they will also see a fall of birth rates and at some point will no longer be able to ""supply"" immigrants to countries in population deficit.

In the end I do not think that immigration is a solution to anything. It's a zero-sum game. An immigrant is a person lost by another country. And at some point, all countries will be in the situation of needing to keep their people.

Although I guess that if there are countries willing to take and pay for our retirees, that would help.

"Abandoning multiculturalism in the Canadian context doesn't mean not working or being friends with people of other cultures, Canadians overwhelmingly approve of that. It means abandoning the failed cultural mosaic idea and returning to the past biculturalism, though this time ideally with a greater respect for natives and no discrimination on an ethnic or racial basis.

Yeah, some immigration is good, but you will be hard pressed to find a Canadian that thinks all immigration should be ended, the problem right now is there is a massive surplus. The government is not trying to maintain population, they are trying to raise the population to 100 million, google ""Century Initiative"".

"We are SOOOO unprepared as a society for the shit that is normalized abroad. I say this as I have Latin America hereitage and have traveled to the region more times than I can count, to the point where I am a bit desensitized to it. I sort of got ""resensitized"" after traveling with a group of Canadians (as in they have lived here their entire lives) to a South American country, many of whom have never been to the region or a 3rd world country, and was amused at seeing their reaction to some of the wild shit that is normal there.  

Now imagine this shock on a national level with millions of long-time Canadian residents and citizens to these massive influx of newcomers, many of whom are unwilling to integrate and will bring their culture with them.  

By all means, share the foods and holidays, language and customs, but there WILL be bad actors that will also bring negative and objectively harmful values with them, and worse, will be unwilling to change. Normally they tend to make up a small portion of the pool of newcomers, as most tend to be more honorable and willing to adapt, but with the sheer volume of newcomers, we will inevitable see an equally large share of dishonest and harmful values and individuals get dragged along to the detriment of everyone involved.   

Honest and honorable immigrants will be blamed for the actions of these bad actors more and more.  

Long time residents and citizens will have to put up with more frequent instances of crime, violence and poor actions by these individuals.  

In time, such activities start to be normalized within certain groups, which will inevitably drive backlash from other groups.  

With cost of living being so high, as well as housing being so scarce and job market being oversaturated with cheap labour, many will inevitably turn to crime, thus fueling this vicious cycle even more.  

The more unequal a society becomes, the more its members tend to embrace activities considered immoral or unjustified by said society.   

And the more people fall into this, the more it will drive extremist views by both Canadians and newcomers alike.

"Canada's population growth as now surpassed China's and India's and it's entirely from imigration.

We are adding over a million imigrants (2024 has indeed reach that number) a year on a system of infrastructure that is not sufficient and was not before the Trudeau administration was even in office. We do not produce enough food, we do not create enough jobs, we do not build enough houses, schools, hospitals, we do not train enough doctors or nurses to even staff potential hopistals.

All the while the imigrants are forced to live 10+ in inadequate housing, in unsustainable conditions and to be kind to your ""das racis!!11!!1!"" mentality, I'm not even going to talk about the various problems that have exploded from importing 3rd word uneducated people.

  
The only tide-pool shallow analysis is yours, because you only stop at people's skin color, you do not look any deeper than that.

  
By the way, do I even need to remind you that 10 years ago, when Trudeau was trying to get elected, he was decrying the ""irresponsible"" and ""unchecked mass imigration"" from the Harper governement, before quadrupling the amount of imigrants per year. It is estimated that by 2040 close to 100% of Canada's population growth will be from immigration and immigrants. Not 2400, 2040... in 15 years.

"there's also just straight-up cultural differences. In the areas where i do a lot of walking, there has been a MASSIVE increase in the number of cyclists and motorized scooters going the wrong way in bike lanes, and drivers going all over the sidewalk, and scooters / ebikes on the subway.

Anyone that was born and raised in canada knows you don't ride a bike on the sidewalk and you don't go the wrong way in a bike lane. It used to be *very rare*, but now it's commonplace. People that are new to the country and who haven't grown up with that sort of disciplince, don't have it, and fall back on their old habits when they are in a rush. I see it happen a lot in cars too, where people are used to countries where you just kind of drive where you need to. If you grew up in canada and went to driving school, you generally know what you do and don't do on the road.

It's not to say people aren't welcome here or they have to assimilate 100%, but it's at the point where it's very noticable and getting a lot worse, and it needs to be addressed before it becomes a public health and safety issue.

The difference now is, it's not a quilted mosaic any more if people are relegated to isolated communities.

"Bullshit.

A spouse visa in the UK now costs £5.5k for any immigrant coming over to live and work. That includes a surcharge to use the NHS even if you don't use it, biometrics scanning appointment (Which is supposed to be free, but they outsourced it to a for-profit) 

That's for two and a half years. 

Average wage outside of London is £25-28k

The Tories made the UK the most expensive country in Europe to immigrate to.

"What do you mean ""is that all?""  The Mongol empire at its height spanned a larger area than the British empire.  If you think that colonisation and expansionism is a white man activity you're quite franky ignorant.

You say you are still recovering from the pillaging of your lands.  Im assuming this change of tone to a personal nature means you are of native descent and based in Canada.

Countries have been invaded, and borders changed all around the world, including in Europe, with millions of peoples displaced since the British displaced your ancestors.  These are so recent that people are alive today who lived through it.  There are current wars going on with significant change of borders and thus significant displacement of peoples all around the world today.  Im sure they'll still be recovering for some time.  You are not unique, and raiding/pillaging/invading is not unique to white people or euro centric powers.  This is a ridiculous statement.

Quite frankly, this entire conversation has been a repeated set of shifting goalposts.  First its that Canada was made due to invasion/conquering.  Then you shift to well only white people do it , not brown/black and you specifically mention Africa.  Then you say well they're not expansionist enough.  Then you finally switch the entire conversation to one about race and then state that you ""know"" that I think the subjugation of people is ok, and more stuff about race.

You dont know anything about me, are accusing me of being racist, and are suggesting that I think its fine when countries/peoples get invaded.  Look at my name genius; Im Latin, not white.  Invading other countries and displacing peoples is obviously wrong.  But none of this series of posts was discussing the morality of conquest, i was pointing out that it occurs and Canada is not some special case.  It is in fact completely and utterly unremarkable.  A powerful country/empire saw some land, and then decided that they wanted it, its going on today and there are cases far more recent than formation of modern day Canada, a number of which are in Europe in fact.  Your absolute blatent racism shows through in every one of your posts.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV5REZBeFlUNDhERmh1V0pvTVRIbUwxSFk3Rm1yc3pUNFYxM0JVeXhnMFFiY1hkOHhDUTdldjhHVE0zZEVPXzl0VmxjbWdkY0ZQbkcyYVQyX3cxOWVTcGc9PQ==

On Netflix, watch The Last Dance to learn about MJ and his chicago bulls team and actually a snippet of ""The Dream Team"" - a superteam of the best NBA players at the time going up against the world in the Olympics and absolutely wrecking...


However, if you want a shorter viewing, stick with the below.

On Netflix, watch The Redeem Team, the last generation's version of The Dream Team. This is a direct ""sequel"" to The Dream Team and chronicles Kobe and Lebron (among others) and their runthrough of another historical olympic run.

Now why is this relevant today?
Well today, Team USA is in the pools trying to win Gold in Paris. This current team, dubbed by fans as ""The Revenge Team"" is this generations version of the events from the past. However, very likely, this will be the last definitely superteam for years to come.

"no I'm talking about them all. Many of the ""illegal immigrants"" are that way because the process to come to a country (USA in this case) are incredibly difficult, expensive, and long winded. And when you're in the USA (depending on state) you can buy a house, go to college, work, etc all without having to prove citizenship or at least having fake papers. So now housing costs are increased bc of immigration, a US job is given to an immigrant, Colleges are more difficult to get into etc etc. Businesses love immigration bc they can take advantage of them and pay them less. Colleges love immigration because the higher the demand for education the more they can charge for tuition. Neither of these benefit natural born citizens.... they actually make things harder for us. This conversation won't change any of it. The US will cont to welcome everyone and will eventually fail in part because of that.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV5bnZNX0JwR1ZsNFlhNVlYcHdDN01hcHNJbFFXMXkzS0lqc2FzUjJyRHk2dHk4aS1YdG9FRGxDWlRUeUpWOFpDb21nRE9HOHVWNmVWUDNrUDg4ZnZ6Mmc9PQ==

The body of a homeless woman is found in an abandoned New Hampshire farmhouse.

For nearly four months, Linda Bishop, a prisoner of her own mind, survived on apples and rain water, waiting for God to save her, during one of the coldest winters on record.

"The comment posted on this blog, suggesting that Kirk Douglas “in his old age,” made “Thanksgiving in Peshawar” for the CIA is baseless. Following are relevant details about the late actor’s participation in the documentary film that I produced in 1982 as an Executive Producer at the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), the film’s sponsor and distributor, an attribution clearly stated in the end credits. The USIA, better known by its radio service, “The Voice of America,” was and independent Agency with its own congressionally allocated budget. Its management took its direction directly from the President, at that time Ronald Reagan. The decision to follow Mr. Douglas’ trip to Pakistan with cameras was a decision made by USIA’s Director, Charles Z. Wick, a presidential appointee. Mr. Douglas undertook the trip as a guest of the Government of Pakistan that welcomed him as an official visitor. The CIA had no role in the film’s initiation, financing, or editorial direction. Claims to the contrary need substantiation; a slope too steep to climb.

 

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Kirk Douglas was well-known for his philanthropy and as an outspoken advocate for freedom and democracy around the world. Before his trip to Pakistan in 1982, as an advocate for Afghan refugees living in the tribal areas of Northern Pakistan,  he had already traveled as a private citizen and at his own expense to forty-plus countries, speaking to audiences about why democracy works and what freedom means. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter awarded Douglas the Presidential Medal of Freedom in a White House ceremony in recognition of his advocacy for freedom and self-determination. Years later, he received the French “Legion of Honor” for distinguished services to France in arts and letters. Like most everyone in the free world, Mr. Douglas saw the Soviet Union’s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan as an attempt by that Communist nation for domination and territorial expansion, and he expressed those opinions in his narration of “Thanksgiving in Peshawar.”  

 

It is little surprising that he was so motivated. The son of Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution from the Russian Empire,  he grew up in poverty in upstate New York (Amsterdam) and was always grateful for the freedom his country provided him to work, obtain a college education and scholarships to acting school during the great depression. When his country entered World War II, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he served as a communications officer until medically discharged in 1944 for injuries sustained in a depth charge explosion.

 

The comment about Kirk’s “old age” in 1982 is laughable. When he and I worked together in Pakistan, Douglas was a vigorous man of sixty-six. He managed the packed six-day itinerary with ease and ran our film crews to exhaustion covering the events on his schedule. At the time of the visit, he ran an active Hollywood production company, and had just finished starring in two major films; “The Final Countdown” in 1980 with Martin Sheen and “The Man from Snowy River,” the 1981 Australian film that won critical acclaim and earned fifty million dollars, fifteen times over its production cost. Immediately after leaving Pakistan , he began making the HBO movie “Draw,” followed by the 1985 CBS movie “Amos.” Three years after our work together, he reunited with his longtime co-star, Burt Lancaster, in the blockbuster crime comedy, “Tough Guys.” In the remaining thirty-eight years of his life, Kirk Douglas was a creative force in acting, producing, and writing. Even after a debilitating stroke in 1996, he remained a public figure and revered champion of personal liberty and human rights.

 

His legacy should not be stained by cheap shots, posted by ignorant commentators.

"There's a big difference, isn't there?

I am TERRIFIED that well-meaning lefties are going to unwittingly destroy our hard fought secular society in the long game, when there are sufficient numbers of conservative Christians and conservative Muslims that realize that they're after largely the same kind of moral authority over people's lives and that they're better partners than enemies.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUwVzJWLUlzaGQ0cXgxcklYdDVkUV9iSVRZMmMwVXZFR3ZvLUt5ZU9Ud3VVRC1yRFFrMWhLU21kM3VwekV5WjlCdkpOM2ZsMFpWdENxcVRoSTljY0swR1E9PQ==

Based on Joel Bakan’s bestseller The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, this 26-award-winning documentary explores a corporation’s inner workings, curious history, controversial impacts and possible futures. One hundred and fifty years ago, a corporation was a relatively insignificant entity. Today, it is a vivid, dramatic, and pervasive presence in all our lives. Like the Church, the Monarchy and the Communist Party in other times and places, a corporation is today’s dominant institution. Charting the rise of such an institution aimed at achieving specific economic goals, the documentary also recounts victories against this apparently invincible force.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4bzJHNk1zQWJlTk56RlY5Ni1aWmZlLUtKb3ZMSjZrLWRpeXZUTkRPYVhIVU10MHQ5M2twZE80MzBnQjlaMVlfMUllVkh5aGNhM1M4eUc5WE11S3Y0SUE9PQ==

"Sounds interesting but Idk who Louis Kahn is, but what did you mean when you said ""show cute"" after ""Shalom Y'all?"" I think the first one sounds interesting even without knowing who that is because I am sure all the kids would have different versions of their father in a way. Especially since how a man is with a child has so much to do with his feelings for the mother, in my opinion- which is funny because my parnets divorced when I was a baby and my dad was nothing less than everything to me, and he was honestly best dad in the whole world so I am not sure where I got this impression but I have it. 

Maybe it is because there are so many fathers that can basically forget about their kids once a new woman and baby come along. My dad never dated again so I did not have to compete with that.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5ZXp4b3BQNWFfLXE2YkhqYThMZ2wtWHN0U3lSZkl2YnpDT2tzeVBkLUtIMmU1Wk1aNmFjLVJxWXVBeFFlZ1BrWDFSRjJRN2xQMXpablVCcXhQX0dEYTRXZDVORGNxX2dpMW53THJqTlZhWlU9

With almost 2.5-3 times the amount of hate crimes per person as Switzerland and the US, it seems Germany either has an actual problem or their threshold to report is much lower.

Just out of curiosity I checked Italy, who was a major participant in WW2 and has very strict laws concerning these things post- WW2

Italy population \\~61m as of 2021

alleged hate crimes reported: 1445

1 alleged hate crime per \\~42,215 people

With this data in mind i'll give the documentary a view, I usually look for corollary data before giving alleged issues a view. Numbers don't lie, so with me being blindly ignorant to what's happening in Germany, it is either an actual issue or an issue with the reporting.

Edit: The video points out the year 2015 when Germany started becoming the ""Global leader in taking refugees in across the world."" After 2 years of this, their amount of hatecrimes more than doubled from a near all-time low of 3046 to 7913, and has been steadily rising ever since. As per the video, this includes attacks against people of Jewish faith.

Edit 2: As per the report data from [hatecrime.osce.org](http://hatecrime.osce.org), hate crimes tagged as anti-semetic was at 192 instances in [2015](https://hatecrime.osce.org/reporting/germany/2015), and is at 3027 instances in[ 2021](https://hatecrime.osce.org/reporting/germany/2021) (in germany).

Edit 3: that's more than a 15x jump in the number of anti-semetic hate crimes

edit 4: the documentary mentions specific examples of anti-semetic and anti-refugee murders by right winged extremists before going into info about the AfD, which is negatively described as a right winged political party within Germany.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU5TksyeUxIV0E0UjJtZGllSXdNYXpncDBYdVNGQkZ4R3hZM3ZHM3c3V3RDUHRTWTF6dzdNWWRLUkNjR1VZUEVXM2R0WDYwSVlCaXE2V0V2cGhiTDUxYUE9PQ==

"Brothers Colin and Ewan McGregor follow up their documentary The Battle of Britain with a film exploring Bomber Command, a rarely told story from the Second World War.  
  
The film focuses primarily on the men who fought and died in the skies above occupied Europe, with numerous examples of individual heroism and extraordinary collective spirit. Colin learns to fly the critical aircraft of the campaign - the Lancaster bomber. But this is also the story of a controversy that has lasted almost 70 years.  
  
The programme covers six years of wartime operations and traces the obstacles and challenges that were overcome as the RAF developed and deployed Bomber Command, an extraordinary fighting force.

"There are few occasions in history when we can say that the actions of a few changed the destiny not just of a country - but of the world. The Battle of Britain is one of those moments. To mark the Anniversary of the Battle of Britain, arguably the most important event in modern British history, brothers Colin and Ewan McGregor present a ninety-minute special that walks us through the timeline of events during the height of the Battle.

Colin is an R.A.F. veteran of twenty years of service, and Ewan is a big-screen hero and a fledgling pilot. Together, they take us on a journey to honour the heroes of 1940 both on the ground and in the air, bringing the story of the Battle of Britain to a new generation.

They will take to the skies over Southern England as Spitfires and Hurricanes fly again over the White Cliffs of Dover. They will discover the Battle's legacy and reveal the inspiring personal stories of the few who were there and those still with us today. Using great aerial footage mixed with impressive historical archive film material, this is truly the definitive programme on the Battle of Britain.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVfd240V0RDOWFJQWNZMGVVSC1BcFpnYkFnSGJOZVowOV9VVlhBTE5IeTdrbnhQaEpCRnh0NV8yZTE0d0hfWGFFQnIxaGVITzhGRk9qYW9xbDZrSTBrM3c9PQ==

"In Germany and many other European countries, there's this ingrained belief that anything right-leaning carries the taint of Nazism, while the left seems immune to criticism, no matter how far off track it goes. It’s like there’s this unspoken rule: ""Left is good, right is bad,"" without considering the actual degree or context.

As a result, we've been caught in a 60-year spiral of left-leaning policies, to the point where even questioning the effects of **illegal** immigration labels you as ""far-right."" It's gotten so extreme that simply voicing concerns about immigration, or any other issue, is enough to get you branded and dismissed.

The left seems to believe that if they throw enough labels at a problem, it’ll disappear. But in reality, the issues—like those caused by immigration—aren’t going anywhere. Now, even farmers and workers, who are directly affected by these policies, are being labeled as ""far-right"" just because they speak up.

The real issue is that the left is unwilling to budge on anything that doesn’t align with their ideology. They hold on tight to their belief that they are ""morally right,"" and that’s all that matters to them, no matter how wrong or damaging their policies may be.

"That depends whether or not we consider our society to be a free and liberal democracy that makes possible collective self-governance and collective self-determination. If such a society did exist, then we would have influence beyond mere personal choice. 

But sadly, it's mean world syndrome and the conditions that promote it that undermine that possibility. Various countries have collectively enforced regulations on the media (and many still do) in order to promote a more democratic media system (e.g., U.S. Fairness Doctrine).

We aren't collectively helpless. That is the problem with the mean world syndrome. It undermines and compromises the capacity to act freely, by making people feel isolated, alone, and helpless. Criticism of those advocating for greater moral responsibility itself a product of mean world syndrome.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHb3VQUlNwbDdiRG5tX2RkUTQ0U21YVV9zWU4tQURrNks1YnptcFA5YkV1ODBjZVQ2LUhjU1NEckJmN0w1ZHFEaUFzRV9FNE1ycjRlanNPNFk1M2ZVdE82LWNubzJ3RXRPS2JEdVVzalJzSU09

"It's amusing how misinformation gets taken as reality. The data shows that, on average (i.e., per capita), there is less violence in cities than in rural areas. Chicago, for example, often gets portrayed as a violent hell hole. But besides being less violent than many rural areas, it's also often gets ranked as less violent than many other big cities, such as big cities down South (e.g., Houston). The rural South is the single most violent area of the United States.

"If you look at the estimated violence data from past centuries, even the least violent periods back then dwarf the highest violence spikes of the past century. Most of us modern Westerners are entirely disconnected from what a violent society is actually like. 

Then again, there are entirely new kinds of stressors in modern society, in and outside the West, that can have problems as bad or worse than violence. Chronic stress, even when moderate, can be more traumatizing than the acute stress of a one-time violent event. Humans aren't designed to deal with continuous stress and anxiety. 

That feeds into the mean world syndrome that gets portrayed as violence. Of course, we could argue that slow violence is violence too. But that would be to change the frame of the discussion entirely. That is what confuses matters, the conflation of physical violence with perceived violence created by general stress.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHNnJDWmpqZ00zRDR3bndmWVlVM1dxaTN1RjdOV01ZUEIzNUhZMzB1ZlNpcUQ3cXhDWS1TcVlWUXhIbzY2VG5hRzE1eVZacUtIaDk2eEVYY0ppWUtNQ0puOWQwcUxHXy1iUDFvdFlSV3hzQ3M9

">At the end of the day, the conflict in the middle east is fueled by the Iranians and their export of the revolution.

This is by far one of the most naive takes on the conflict and reeks of Western propaganda. 

The conflict in the Middle East is fueled by Israel's occupation, its continued oppression of the Palestinians, and US meddling.

If the US stopped arming, supporting, and protecting Israel, a solution to the conflict would have been implemented eons ago. 

Hezbollah and Hamas came to existence because of what Israeli occupation and practices. The killing, imprisonment, and brutal conditions which they were subjected to resulted in their formation. 

Remove the reason they fight, the fight ends, and Iran has no one to support. 

Lebanon is a hub for international meddling, you've got the phalange party whose leader is an Israeli puppet, you've got Future party whose leader is a Saudi puppet, you've got the progressive socialist party whose leader sells his allegiance to the highest bidder (usually the US), Hezbollah with direct ties to Iran, and so on. 

Jordan is a former British bitch, now passed on to the US. It is rampant with corruption, nepotism, and police brutality. Its king's six offshore bank accounts (revealed in the swissleaks hack) are filled to the brim with the money the US gives under the guise of ""aid."" It is a spy and operation base for most of the world's spy agencies. The British even control and manipulate what the media and news are allowed to show and say.

Egypt is a military dictatorship. Its president is a US groomed and prepared asset that took over the presidency when it became obvious Morsi wasn't going to play ball. The military industrial complex there owns and operates businesses and factories ranging from candy to steel and other industries. 

Syria's conflict is about gas and oil pipelines and breaking Russia's stronghold on the European gas market. Had they agreed to break away from Russia and let the pipeline go through, they wouldn't be at war.

KSA's MBS killed and chopped up a dissident journalist. The country treats their Shia minority like lepers, opresses, and antagonizes them. They use their money and status in the region to bully smaller neighboring countries into toeing the official Saudi line or suffer the consequences. See Qatar and Lebanon, for examples of that. 

I could go on and in mote detail, but this should suffice to show you're literally clueless about the region and gobbled up propaganda.

"Here is what is hard for people to wrap their minds around. Some aspects are getting better as some are getting worse. I wonder if this mix makes it feel even more distressful, particularly combined with generalized chronic stress and free-floating anxiety. While our lives are generally safer and more comfortable, so many of us are constantly stressed out, overwhelmed, and exhausted.

Historically speaking, at least here in most of the developed world, violence rates are extremely low, the worst problems of poverty have been moderated with welfare, public education and literacy have become the norm, and on and on. Yet we are facing potentially world-changing consequences of climate change, a looming world war that could devastate civilization, and possibly a new era of totalitarianism worse than the last.

Infectious diseases, parasitism, and nutritional deficiencies are less common. Yet numerous other diseases, health issues, and neurocognitive conditions are skyrocketing (cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancer, infertility, dementia, mood disorders, psychosis, autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, etc). This particularly stands out in the U.S. with high rates of stress-related diseases, addiction, and alcoholism.

The media's fear-mongering narratives are at least comforting because they are simplistic and straightforward, giving the illusion of a world that makes sense without having to consider the nuance and complexities. Whereas to comprehend reality as it is requires higher levels of thoughtfulness, intelligence, critical thinking, media literacy, and education.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHak1DNWRsLUhIZFFPX2UtV0ZNVkJkUVpoOEIwOTlKUFJ3RUNuUDFxV2J1VlNqNmNrYm9YaFZMOEg2UWdud0RmeDhGUkY3TGdKQXFTUXpzWjNHVTVMUWR0SXI1M0U3aWZfX0tfa2dJQnRBbVk9
The corporate media aren't only scratching an itch but also causing or exacerbating that itch. It would be like a company selling an anti-itch ointment that contained a skin irritant.

"Scratch a cynic and you'll find a failed optimist. One hears that claim made, but it isn't entirely correct. I don't feel like a failed optimist so much as I conclude the society I live in has morally failed to live up to even a fraction of our collective potential. Also, it's more about pessimism than outright cynicism. 

Because I can see the potential, I often lean toward long-term optimism. My optimism never went away. I just understand almost all progress happens over generations, centuries, and millennia. So, I'm often a short-term pessimist about the immediate world, particularly in terms of each election cycle.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHWHk2amcySGNrUEkzX0tua0o0VTRBNmY0U1lwdnBXU3h3N3ljMFRvdy1ZQWt2WDFkTXF1ekk2RnJ4MkR3MnF6enZaVktoYmJUY2xQNkZhcTdZZVdhSlQwT2xGb1ZreFpJZm5VWW12RzV0Umc9
"The point is that you aren't asking the media to self-regulate. As with the Fairness Doctrine, we can and have in the past regulated corporate media for the public good.

"Another example of how we aren't collectively helpless. If we the citizens don't like a government that cuts funding to what promotes the public good, then we have the right, freedom, responsibility to change that government. 

And if they act despotic, we should do as the American founders did, not necessarily the violence but the demand for self-governance. The American Revolution was incited over less egregious oppression than we are presently experiencing. Many people forget that. 

So, why are we so much more cynical, apathetic, and passive? That is what the corporate media does, as the propaganda arm of the government. We need to learn media literacy. The American founders didn't have to face a highly advanced propaganda system.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHR2dzY2o0ZjFqaWM0aGpVTDVBNGFtQUxyU0tWUnpJY282ZTlPdXBZMFdsMXpIbDR5N3BPOFFxY0wzQXI4TDg4bXB0Wk5rMklFdGx2dmhuOW5jY2pYTnY2TEQyckZhcWQ5emU3U2xNZGRPYWs9
"You are one of the few willing to call a spade a spade.

"You are correct about at least certain areas of corporate media, particularly that of Murdoch and friends. No honest person could describe it any other way than as propaganda.

I would say both of you are very correct.

That's the title of a German comedy movie from 2015 about Hitler just spawning at the site of the bunker where he ""unalived"" himself. It explores how Hitler himself would behave in our time. It's quite funny but at the same time it highlights how he would just go to talk shows saying the same old stuff and how people nowadays would agree with him. The title means ""He is back"". And that's exactly it. The new propaganda machine called the internet works quite well.

"That is an interesting link! I know men who fought it though, or at least I did before time took what all Hitler's might could not. Modern accounts tend to blunt the edge and their oral history is now lost to us. The historians will prose about how pilots were fighting the opponent's *aeroplanes* and not the men inside. That is a modern fiction to make the matter more palatable. The truth was the men of Fighter Command knew that aeroplanes were replaceable but men were not--they wanted every single German airman dead, *not* going home to his family and *not* flying another sortie tomorrow.

It was a true battle for survival and every bit as visceral and unimaginably brutal as Kursk or Stalingrad.

"It was so amazing, in fact, such a triumph, that when we observed an *otherwise-unexplained* precession of the orbit of Mercury, scientists naturally applied those same techniques the locate the missing planet -- dubbed *Vulcan* -- inside the orbit of Mercury, responsible for the gravitational tugging.  Every few years astronomers across the globe would converge on some eclipse location like *Woodstock*, hoping to get a glimpse of the planet that was otherwise drowned out in the sun's glare.  They never found anything.

(Well, strictly speaking they found lots of stuff, stuff they thought was Vulcan, but was always just some random star that wasn't all that exciting.  A lot of false positives from those eclipses.)

Until 1915, when a little-known Swiss patent clerk's work introduced a 1/r^4 term to the formula for gravity, and we realized there was no Vulcan, that the precession of Mercury's orbit was explained by General Relativity.

"AfD's first platform point calls for “direct democracy, separation of powers and the rule of law.” Its much-decried position on Islam calls for bans on full public veiling and foreign funding and operation of mosques, provisions that [already](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13038095) [exist](https://www.state.gov/reports/2021-report-on-international-religious-freedom/denmark/) in other European countries. Every country has the right to decide their migratory policies and their cultural outlook.

Ah, you're right of course. If they actually wanted to dismantle democracy, they'd obviously just list it in their manifesto.

"And here it is. 

Your response is built on a shaky foundation of supposition, mind reading, and conspiracy theories. You're assuming the worst intentions without concrete evidence, relying on speculation about what might be said behind closed doors rather than addressing what has actually been proposed.   
Surveillance by the BfV is not a conviction, and leaks are not definitive proof of sinister intent. How naive can you be to assume that surveillance has never been misused as a political tool or that leaks are always made in good faith?

"AfD politicians have talked about ""hunting down"", ""weeding out"" and ""disposing of"" their political opponents. They have spread the great replacement myth and other far-right conspiracy theories, participated in neo-Nazi marches, used Nazi slogans, called for homosexuals to be imprisoned and for migrants to be shot at the border. They have also made plans for the eventual expulsion of foreigners, German citizens with non-German ethnic backgrounds, and even ""weak or unwilling"" ethnic Germans should they come into power.

Those are facts. No supposition, mind reading or conspiratorial thinking required.

“There was no break, let alone a conscious break, with the Nazi past” at the federal prosecutor’s office, the authors concluded, stressing “the great and long continuity” of the functions held and “the high number” of officials involved in Hitler’s regime.

Chief federal prosecutor Peter Frank commissioned the study in 2017.

"I was one of the first people to pre order the Light Phone 3. But ultimalty canceled my order. I have to use 2fA at least 2-3 times a week. And I live overseas and the main way I call and message my family and friends is What's App. MAYBE I could figure out another way to stay in close contact with international friends and family cheaply, but I would 100% have to carry around another device for 2fA. Which makes the Light Phone and other dumb phones pointless for me. 

Sucks. I really want to be detached more. But its like an alcholic with a six pack in their fridge. If it was so easy to quite... then it wouldn't be addiction. The only way is to not be around it. Not have that six pack in the fridge. 

For me, its not social media, its being connected 24/7 and the whole world expecting me to respond instantly to text messages and emails. Its is reddit to a degree. 5 minutes to wait... gotta pulla out my phone and get on reddit. 

I am not as bad as lot of people who walk while using their phone 24/7. And I put that shit away if I am at a bar or dinner or party or cafe. People time is people time. I still really hate the idea we have to be connected 24/7.

"Light Phone 3. 
50 mega pixil camera. With an actual click click button. 
No one has any idea if the actual camera will end up being good. A lot of it has to do with the lens, right?

The phone is pre order only right now 500$ which I think is worth it. 
but will be 800$ when it comes out. Which I think is fucking insane for a dumb phone. So you would have to take a chance now... sell it I guess if the camera ends up sucking. 

I preordered one like 2 days after it was announced but after thinking about it a week, I had to cancel. There are too many fucking things I need on a weekly basis like 2fA which the phone wont support.

I hope the phone does well. I wish we had more choices like this.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTRmhDU0lZVlB5Y0h6X2FKUGpic3lSa1JFUjRPM1k1YzdXenJtSnlWMUNxcnNmUG1rNzRUYm9vZEt3RUJUNlkxQjU2eEF0UGpVZXRoSDdIRU1tQ3FvRlBEb0NDSGZKcU1NMTJmN2xuYV9xNkE9
"When you rewind and see the formation of mega(study) group in the early 80’s and how Bronfman went to Russia to put most of the kleptocracy parts into play even before the Soviet Union broke down it restarts the timeline back almost a decade. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_Group_(Jewish_group)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bronfman_Sr.


Then you start seeing Trumps attorney Roy Cohn who introduced Rupert Murdoch to Reagan just to play him like a fiddle as he devolved into dementia and get his fairness doctrine workaround for Fox “ENTERTAINMENT” News despite not being a U.S. citizen.

https://consortiumnews.com/2015/01/28/how-roy-cohn-helped-rupert-murdoch/

And how a sunset clause on octogenarian politicians and an accurate tracing of greed would have stopped 80% of this. 

But by default it also shows just how ruthlessly vigilant the Russian oligarchs were at executing their bigger play against the U.S. democracy even while the USSR was coming apart at the seams. 

The Israel relationship, AIPAC capex, and Jeffrey Epsteins mega group intel work all went both ways with the Russians. 

And considering what a sensitive subject the red army failing in Afghanistan was to the Russians (Charlie Wilson’s war) you start to see Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan as different moving fronts of the same war between the 1st and 2nd world at the expense of the 3rd, drawn out over the 20th century. 

By extension Gaddafi/Libya, Saddam/Iraq, and Assad/Syria all fall into the same basic methodology.

https://www.newsweek.com/tulsi-gabbard-bashar-assad-controversy-explained-1452141

They all received Russian weapons and support through it all which was essentially just draining the US who tried to go in and John Wayne/ world police the humanitarian crisis’ and/or perpetuate the USD as the worlds reserve currency.  (See also Putins use of Wagner mercenaries in North Africa, the CCP using Belt&Road as espionage colonialism, trumps abandonment of the Kurdish allies, and Russian support of Abu Sayyaf in Mindanao Philippines. 

https://jamestown.org/program/brief-the-philippines-on-the-verge-of-victory-against-abu-sayyaf/

Then overlap the evolutionary recurring grifts trump and Epstein enabled including but not limited to, 9/11 and 2008, to the same effective goal of destroying and consuming democracies economy.  

As long as you don’t care about a little casual genocide to pump a war/ kleptocracy play and drain the American treasury it’s just another Tuesday for the oligarchy.  

They just needed Netanyahu in power in Israel to play the in-between and push the AIPAC agenda through the backdoor while pushing the religious wars up front. 

Israel and Saudi just drained some more U.S. assets off on the way past.  

You can even backtrack that objectively through aeronautic espionage of the F-22 and F-35 jet developments and how that data moved through Israel and on to Russia and their ally Chinas respective jet development programs as a backup to your dataset. 

You can fake a lot of things.  But you can’t fake good engineering. 

Transparent democracy was always bound to turn into a binary fight against authoritarian kleptocracy. 

Freedom of speech is a direct threat to the established and very lucrative business model of aristocratic authoritarian kleptocrats. 

Eisenhower identified it and warned about it in his final speech a few years before John Kennedy was killed over it.  

In World War Two, even before the lend lease program solidified the corrupt relationships between the military industrialists, soviet era oil oligarchs and and their U.S. oil oligarchs created relationships based on the common denominator of greed and control, because Fred Koch was a psychopath. Anyone who can build gas refineries for the Nazis and Stalin would, deductively, have to lack empathy, knowing full well that they put the love of money over human lives consistently. 

That, in correlation with the American central bankers like JP Morgan all effectively hobbled Nikola Teslas work on free, unlimited, decentralized energy, because they knew that whomever controlled fossil fuels would control the 20th century.  

It just took 80 more years for the proliferation of that petro mob into the two respective 1st and 2nd world goverments to complete the horseshoe theory.

Rex Tillerson

In 1998, he became a vice president of Exxon Ventures (CIS) and president of Exxon Neftegas Limited with responsibility for Exxon's holdings in Russia and the Caspian Sea. He then entered Exxon into the Sakhalin-I consortium with Rosneft.[18][29]
In 1999, with the merger of Exxon and Mobil, he was named executive vice president of ExxonMobil Development Company. In 2004, he became president and director of ExxonMobil.[30] Upon this appointment Tillerson's replacement of Lee Raymond as CEO of Exxon Mobil was implied.[31] His major competitor was Ed Galante, another Exxon executive.[32] On January 1, 2006, Tillerson was elected chairman and CEO, following the retirement of Lee Raymond.[4] At the time, ExxonMobil had 80,000 employees, did business in nearly 200 countries, and had an annual revenue of nearly $400 billion.[18]
Under Tillerson's leadership, ExxonMobil cooperated closely with Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a longtime U.S. ally, as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.[33] From 2003 to 2005, a European subsidiary of ExxonMobil, Infineum, operated in the Middle East providing sales to Iran, Sudan and Syria. ExxonMobil leaders said they followed all legal frameworks, and that such sales were minuscule compared to their annual revenue of $371 billion at the time.[34] In 2009, ExxonMobil acquired XTO Energy, a major natural gas producer, for $31 billion in stock. Michael Corkery of The Wall Street Journal wrote that ""Tillerson's legacy rides on the XTO deal.""[35] Tillerson approved Exxon negotiating a multibillion-dollar deal with the government of Iraqi Kurdistan, despite opposition from President Barack Obama and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, both of whom argued it would increase regional instability.[18]
Tillerson lobbied against Rule 1504 of the Dodd–Frank reform and protections, which would have required Exxon to disclose payments to foreign governments.[18] In 2017, Congress voted to overturn Rule 1504 one hour before Tillerson was confirmed as Secretary of State.[18]

One was meant to destabilize/discredit sleepy joe by committing him to an unachievable timeline assuming trump wasn’t able to retake the presidency by manipulation or force on Jan 6.

The other play was to hand his buddy Erik Prince the taxpayer funded contract to privatize the extremely lucrative war in Afghanistan.

Prince also had ambitions in Ukraine.

https://time.com/6076035/erik-prince-ukraine-private-army/

~2008 Prince learned just how hard it was to muster a last minute air force and it’s associated spare parts supply chain when the decision was made to supply the Afghan National Army and Police with Russian made Mi-17 helicopters instead of US/Boeing made MD500’s.

It was a logistics and ITAR nightmare that necessitated that Prince function as a cutout for the US government and many new Russian/mercenary relationships were solidified.

Trumps closed door meeting with the Taliban at camp David makes a lot more sense when you realize that he has been laundering money for the Russians since the 80’s (Russia was still an invading force in Afghanistan in 89) and was beholden to them and the Saudis both.  

Every US soldier in Afghanistan and every Afghan was set up to fail by a kleptocracy long before any of these recent plans were made.  It’s just that the whole point of the game of hot potato is to make someone else get left holding the shit nobody wants.

It’s usually the guy at the top of the working class and just below the ruling class that absorbs the bullshit narrative from above and passes it on to the people below because he trusts management and doesn’t realize that psychopathy migrates up to positions of power specifically for exactly that reason.  

Erik Princes sister is Betsy DeVos who has systematically destroyed the U.S. department of education for the same reason. 

Project 2025 is just the inbred child of their collective psychopathy designed to privatize U.S. resources and recreate a bigger version of soviet perestroika.

In predictably Trump fashion, he babbled about the 9/11 attacks before they happened. In the 25 years since then we have millions of more data points on trumps behavior patterns when he makes veiled threats. Most of them look like a bad rendering of a Scorsese movie because that was his primary trainer growing up. He watched mob movies and just imitated the actors that were in reality pretending to be the monster he is. Trump just managed to hide the money laundering well enough to keep the larger connections from being made. 

https://www.cbsnews.com/video/donald-trump-says-he-predicted-911-attacks/

￼

Saudi (for whom trump has been laundering money for since the 90’s) bought the 45th floor of trump towers 3 months before the September 11th attacks. 

It was basically front row seats to their own MASSIVE theft/con.

Epsteins plane fell off radar for 3 days going into saudi the night of trumps 2016 election.  Russia had hacked the DNC convention to ensure that the finals were between clinton and trump because they had Kompromat over them both.  Just not Bernie.

"Left by the Soviets?  It didn't survive. Hell it was corrupted and the locals hated it, It didn't help when the US came in and Karzy became president. He wasn't even elected by his own people, he was implanted.The Afghan government couldn't control the country after the Soviets left. The country has a long history of wars, not to mention plagued by warlords, militias and different groups fighting. Taliban filled the vacuum, promising  their religion, law and order and took over, even with many ethnic groups not accepting them.The country is almost still living in the Stone age. Especially the further you get away from Kabul. The most recent technology you can find/see is internet cafes and cell phones. Again that slowly diminishes the further you get away from major cities. Especially when you get into the mountains and you get into those valleys that are very isolated from the rest of the country. Where what little electricity they have is hydro powered thanks to foreign funding. Homes made of rock, dirt, hay and cow shit.  A majority of their vehicles are 20 plus years old being held together by spit and clothing hangers. 
The country is made up of various different ethnic and culture groups. Pashtu being the most widely known and biggest.(Taliban being majority Pashtu.) They still even have nomad groups that literally still move around the country on camels with tents. Words can't even describe it. I've seen the remains of the Soviets, I've even seen castles from the Alexandria era when they were in that country. I even tried to bring back home an old British rifle from when they were there. But back to the isolation, many regions have little to no interest in who was running the country, because it didn't really affect them. They didn't see them really at all.  They just wanted to remain tending to their fields and livestock.  They strongly defend their beliefs and practices, unfortunately it's pretty similar to what the Taliban did while in power. One major, being women/ girls have zero rights. No freedoms, no education, no employment. Just property that can be bought with a couple goats. It's a very long and dark history and a good read to look at. But besides the after effects of wars and the Taliban, it is an absolutely beautiful country and I'd love to go back.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZZU2Y0eXNwNUpETlRSeU5IOWIyNmUxUWhWTmlVbEp2TWw1YnE0SVNMaDBweGVmc2pDdXJRY2NyU2duQVZqcFVMeHl0Qk1Iallsb185eG9yVFUtblBWTkE9PQ==

"SUGARCANE. Now playing in NYC at Film Forum. 


In 2021, unmarked graves were discovered around Canadian church-run boarding schools, belatedly exposing the hundred-year efforts to strip First Nations children of their culture and identity: Indigenous languages were banned, children were separated from their families and abused, and some disappeared. SUGARCANE begins with a First Nation investigation at St. Joseph’s Mission school near the Sugarcane Reservation in British Columbia. 


With tremendous empathy, co-directors Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie (winners of the Sundance Directing award) document the lucid, intimate memories of survivors of the school — including a leading advocate/investigator; a former tribal chief who is still a practicing Catholic; and NoiseCat’s own father and grandmother, whose tragic story went unspoken for years.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZaZGNrc3o0N2NpaFNwMUtZWDJuLVN5LW41Q084NHRKdGZxbGlsMkpRQmtGTlU2WGI0TnVTUHJyNlZPRjliM25td0dOZm5OZ21qM2NMNmtQb2FveG1rOUE9PQ==

"Twenty year old man, rapist and murderer who is detained after he brutally murdered a fifteen year old … and when he is caught he only asks to call his dad. The cops say, you’re an adult, you can only call a lawyer.  He again says I want to call my dad, over and over.  

Then he immediately starts coming up with a lie cover story after they check his phone etc that the young teen hit herself over the head with the wrench (asshole). During the trial he blames it on that nameless people, that he “handed them the tools”.  

Cody never took one iota of responsibility , and his first and only concern is getting help from his dad and I assume— to start the lies so he could work on his dad. Get his dad to believe he didn’t do it. 

I cannot imagine what that poor dad feels like but I wonder if he is in denial ? With how much denial that psychopath instantly directed to his dad? 

Just tragic senseless horrible crimes, especially insane for someone that age! His parents and family must be in hell as well but it’s hard to believe he never showed signs of his psychopathy at all.  

Cody had no regret or empathy for his victims I can’t imagine he could fake being a human that well to fool everyone.  It happens though! So sorry to hear his dad appeared to be a decent human.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZaQUFKcmdBZHpwaGJ5UzZhTnMzWmw1cUJ3Y2ktUXRtUHV2Nk43bDlBR1FYaE9FQVlLUkZhMTZzR2ExQnlUdmZBNlZwVVRTbzVrTWdRcEJDTXI3aVBEQUE9PQ==

"My brother told me about a reddit post about a person who got revenge on someone that was like nuclear or most likely beyond as he ended up in prison for life and it got so much attention that it attracted interest by Netflix and they made a documentary on the whole situation.

Details he mentioned that I remember:

The gist of the revenge was that it was against a woman as she had ruined his life, but can't remember the exact details  on how she ruined him, and years later he planned to ruin hers.

He kidnapped her kid and handed them off to a couple who promptly disappeared into the ether and he won't divulge who or where.

Part of the revenge was something about trapping the rest of the family in the house while it was set ablaze, not sure if they died but at least to keep them occupied and out of the way.

One of the final acts of revenge is to confess face to face on what did to her child but also walking away with her unable to do anything to stop him as he had shot her in the leg.

Tried to look this up but Google only kept directing me to general true crime documentaries but nothing like the one I'm looking for.

"Jim Smyth, the detective who interrogated Russell Williams stated that how Russell came on their radar is they set up a road block near Jessica L.'s house, the last murdered victim.   A LE had been on the road that night and noted an SUV in the field next to the house, but didn't stop and get the tag info.  The night of the road block to check for suspects, Russell was the last one to the road stop, going home from the base that night; and they were going to shut it down.

They noted his tire tracks were very similar to the ones they found in the snow, and of course it was an SUV.  Russell also stated he needed to get going as he had a sick child at home he needed to attend to.  When they looked on his profile, they saw he had no children, so him lying flagged their attention in addition to the tire tracks.  Then they noted he had residences in all the places the women had been victimized.

  
Then Russell Williams willingly gave his DNA, thinking if he acted cooperative nothing would happen, I guess.  He also wore the same boots to the interrogation that he wore to Jessica L.'s house.  Jim Smyth said if he hadn't confessed that night they still would have ended up cracking the case with him as the perpetrator, it just would have taken longer.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhaEw2S1JXMWZfcnozXzV4V29DMWxobUNwcXlVblZ0VjhLaF9aVmxnQ2VCSV95RnEzWEpjVVBNRy12OVEwM1BSSXBPbnVMOFhjWFF4bHpDYmZ0ZGJHelE9PQ==

"Yes, classic example of a horrible LE interrogation is the interrogation of Sarah Boone, where the detectives basically just argued with her for several hours instead of building repo ire and taking the signs she gave them to make her feel heard, to give her an out, so she felt safe confessing, to stroke her ego, and to take her clues about what is important to her.  They likely could have had her singing like a canary if they had asked her about what she endured as a DV victim.  If they had told her lies that anyone would understand her wanting to make her boyfriend pay, and they completely understand she valued integrity and would never have hurt him intentionally.  She would have relaxed and likely would have said things that would have made the conviction in court easy.

"Actually not true.  The behavior panel interviewed Jim Smyth and they had very little evidence against Williams the day he walked in.  [https://youtu.be/9e8s4iZIPy8?si=Xy0pFbNYb8xRnRtp](https://youtu.be/9e8s4iZIPy8?si=Xy0pFbNYb8xRnRtp)  Jim Smyth said All they had on Russ the day they brought him in was that he had homes in both areas, he crossed paths with all these four women(drove by their homes, lived nearby or worked with them at the base), his tires were similar to the tracks in the snow by Jessica L's house; and, he lied when they did a road stop.   

To shorten the road interview Russell told them he needed to get home to a sick child, whom they found was non existent when they researched it.  They had absolutely nothing else at that time, but Jim Smyth was masterful in building repo ire and the techniques he used.  He brought a huge file in with Russel's name on it that was practically empty and he winged it, going on clues by Russel as to what was important to him.

So, Jim Smyth masterfully handled this interrogation and once they saw the boot prints and tire tracks were the same, he winged it and confronted Russell.   He didn't do this before just acting like they were just trying to rule him out as a suspect and asked what he would be willing to give them.  He agreed to DNA samples, and boots etc. thinking if he cooperated they wouldn't suspect him further.   Jim says they still knew it was a long shot because likely 1000 vehicles had the same tires, and many people could have worn boots like Russell had on.  He winged it not knowing but suspecting.  Once Jim confronted him and he knew they had his DNA, he knew he was sunk.  I don't think he wanted a long court case where he was repeatedly humiliated,  Against the advice of his lawyer he told them everything.  His sense of honor, that he told Jim he'd work with him.  His lawyer would advice him to to talk, and he'd listen and then do it anyway.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhRHJjTnNjUU1pNEVERUZzSWxkdTdtTGVxUkxvU2hHNkNqc005aGRBSnNyNl9iVi1ma1U3ZWhjNXVXQ0Q1eTZadlViZE5fWDNrOXktZjJkZE1aa3U4REE9PQ==

"I'd actually call the idea that Jim Smyth was a sociopath ridiculous.  LE can lie to any suspect legally, so he wasn't acting as a sociopath being deviant from societies values and rules.  If you look at his life Jim Smyth is a wonderful man, father, husband etc.  There was only one psychopath or sociopath.

Jim Smyth acted totally within the law and within what his training dictated was appropriate. He masterfully confronted the perpetrator in such a respectful way, building repo ire, and then making that famous statement, ""Your vehicle drove up the side of Jessica L's property, and your boots walked to the back of Jessica L's home.""

  
Jim Smyth says regardless of Russell Williams confessing that night, eventually with all the evidence they obtained at the interrogation and other info, they would have eventually realized Russell Williams was the perpetrator, it just would have taken a lot longer.  Without his DNA, and boots etc. they couldn't have drawn a confession out of him.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhYmtiZkJUZnVsb1BoZHdvQThCUzAxYkI5Ukk4VDdnX0RsVnBYaEJCTGo2NnJ3RVBTM2JCTGtrZU9XX2dCN0xSdlQ3VU9GdnJINE03VEVRLUlpT2FBRHc9PQ==

"> The key was they didn't connect the events as possibly being multiple victims of one person

From what I have read the women felt that their concerns weren't taken seriously at all. For a town the size of Tweed that only has 6,000 people in it the number of break ins probably should have led to warning but ok I get you could argue these were minor crimes. However when there were multiple sexual assaults in Tweed alone that should have most definitely led to them issuing a warning.

This isn't an example of cops not connecting cases far away from each other that would have been difficult to piece together, this is an example of police never bothering to issue a warning when it was unbelievably obvious you should. You had a spike in break ins and sexual assaults in a small town, it doesn't matter if you think it might be different people, you issue a warning.

The OPP and the detachment in particular was roundly criticized for their incompetence and ignoring the obvious signs in a small town that something was up.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZiV0d4bS1uYlBaZnU4VG9SNWVZdzBmUk90dUl0X202N0cyRExjZnIzd21rdlpLb2JFWmRhZUQwekFFNlk3RE56SDZJbGdlWkl6WVVuQW1EUTlETENYeFE9PQ==

"I mean this sub is pretty dead.

This is something brand new that they are doing so I offered them a pin till tomorrow when I announce the next theme. I mean why not?

You'll find plenty of forums for those transactions, but I'm damned sure not linking them here.  I'm sure they are (justifiably) banned by reddit.

Vice had an article on this that was actually titled [How to Sell a Subreddit](https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-to-sell-a-subreddit/) about the sale of the Frisson subreddit, which was a top 400 sub at the time.  There are plenty more articles, but like I said, many have been memory-holed.

TheoryofReddit had [a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3mrfw2/how_much_money_is_control_of_a_subreddit_worth/) in reference to that sale.  Some of the comments talk about the mods of SkinCareAddiction using the sub for personal gain and other comments about how money could be made off the sub and include a link to the thread where it initially came to light.

""“Stink!” opens with a foul smell and a pair of kids pajamas. And a single father trying to find out what that smell could possibly be. But instead of getting a straight answer, director Jon Whelan stumbles on an even bigger issue in America, which is that some products on our store shelves are not safe -- by design.

"> In February 2020, a shocking video began to circulate on Chinese social media. A group of African children are being instructed, by a voice off-camera, to chant phrases in Chinese. The kids repeat the words with smiles and enthusiasm — but they don’t understand that what they’re being told to say is “I am a black monster and my IQ is low.” The clip ignited outrage in China and beyond.

"Hi

I cannot remember the name of the documentary series



it was played on Discovery ID (Investigation Discovery)

this series was similar to Evil Lives Here but it was aired before that  (I think it was aired about 2011/2012)



I remember one episode (the one I would realy like to watch again)

where there was a son that talked about his father 

His father brought woman home where he keep them

one was kept in a tree with a nedle

and some small quite cute (the son described it that way) was tied in the bathroom, then they put her in the trunk, drove somewhere and father killed her with an axe, then father forced his son to dispose the body with him (IIRC they burned her with tires)

this son also said that once he had woken up and his father was sitting by its side with a gun and wanted to kill him



in some other episode there was a son whose wather was a mafia bos, this son described how mafia works and that he would become a man once he would kill someone but then when this killing began his uncle killed (I think he was a snitch) the person instead of this sone

Son also said that his wather wanted him to be in jail instead of him



and in some other Episode there was a lady whose wather adopted/brought home a woman, which would be her sister and her father sex with this sister and she couldn't tell her mother and should warn his father and this sister to stop having sex when mother came

then she told her mother about it and his father beat her mother and trew a bucker of cold water on her head

they also had a dog (IIRC it was German Shepherd), that had some problems (he couldn't keep his urin in and urinated through the whole house) once she was a sleep his wather beat this dog (I think his(dogs) name was Pat or something like that) til death, she heard him cry) then in the morning her father told her that this dog died and went to heaven



then once she was old anough her father told her that she must go and live on her own, so she went under some bridge where there is warm (I think she new that dumbs go there)



Then she maried and had a daughter and wanted to show that doughter to her father but her father ignored her and didn't want to see the doughter



Hope I provided enough details for someone to remember the documentary name I don't need the names of episodes (although if someone know which episodes those were I would love to know) as once I got the name of the documentary series it will be a bit easier to find specific episodes



Thanks for Helping and Best Regards",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZpbzBWVUcyTE40UmhpQjhMMURncHVZOFVud19XR1M2cndZZ2JYZ3Y4SGRDTWhUcy1lN2dWa2RnaGpMVVp1bm1xWkU0aU5qVzhfR3BvcTJ5ekJvb2FOU1E9PQ==

"I want more of stories and experiences shared such these two families and their perseverance through struggles. 

There’s such a disconnect in our society in understanding and comprehension of how families struggle with benefits and without benefits. While these families didn’t receive benefits, there are families that need support. 
The amount of politicians and members of the community do not even understand how little benefits actually contribute. If Americans were educated on how their money actually benefited society there wouldn’t be as much hostility towards “welfare.” They do not understand what SNAP is or HCBS waivers their state has. 

Could you imagine a reality TV show where politicians or upper middle class citizens had to live off benefits?! There needs to be more exposure and education on how we actually help EVERYONE succeed. To help each other up as a society as a whole.

"lol. 911 was a military op plane and simple. On September the 11, for the first time ever the whole of North America had no fighter coverage because they had arranged an unprecedented number of drills for that day that left most fighters 'spent' ie no fuel. The air traffic control towers had sim inputs injected into their screens that simulated various hijacked planes, so they were literally chasing phantoms. In congregational testimony when asked about the drills having an impact on their ability to respond, whoever was in charge of it, I forget his name, claimed that the drills enhanced their ability to respond to the hijackings, even though officially no planes were intercepted, which is just an absurdity. The crazy part was, the drills were not cancelled when 911 was happening, they continued until the event was over.

But ignoring all this, they literally practiced the event. 3 months before 911 the military were running hijack drills that featured Osama Bin Laden.

"At the beginning of 1914, the unknown cameramen recorded the first film about the Serbian capital city Belgrade for the Serbian film producer Svetozar Botorić. The most important places and streets in Belgrade were recorded in the film: outings spot Topčider with the famous church, Residence of Prince Miloљ Obrenović and the oldest plane tree in the city that was planted in this yard, then Botanical garden, ice on the Sava and the Danube rivers and the settlement Karaburma, monument of the scientist Josif Pančić, Grand market close to Gospodar Jovanova street, square Slavija, military hospital, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, building of the Seventh regiment, Railway station, Karađorđeva street, Botorić hotel “Paris“ on Terazije (this footage was probably made in the summer of 1913), Novo groblje (New cemetery) with gravestones of the renowned Serbians, Seismological station. In the film we can see barriers put up on the river banks for protection of ships and tugboats from the icebergs on the Sava and the Danube. The camera also recorded the icebergs movements on the 13th February 1914 upon the old Calendar (the 26th February upon the new Calendar), which had never been seen until then.

The US may have the best healthcare but we have the worst system. I was just charged $855 for a 30 minute discharge from the hospital! Not my hospital stay, discharge paperwork! I work in Utilization Review and discharge paperwork is copy and paste prewritten forms. 

We have great colleges but they’re entirely too expensive for a slip of paper with provide no up to date experience. College used to be about learning not having the professors new textbook version that you cannot buy used or resell.

"Same thing happened to the previous 49 continental States of America. Welcome to the United States, Hawaii.

Update: since this is getting downvoted I feel the need to explain. It was sarcasm.

"Had Japan and Germany won, Hawaii would be Japan's territory. Had Britain wanted to, they would have colonized Hawaii. Every country in this world was once inhabited by someone and then taken over at some time.

Even Japan has people in the north, the Ainu, who do not look Japanese and have very different traditions. They look Cherokee and even have some Native American traditions. They claim they were there before the Japanese. So who was there first? Where did the Japanese come from?

In the US, there are sights that have relics from Scandinavia. Were they here first, or were the Indians? Our knowledge about humans is incomplete and doesn't go back very far. To say you are the first people to occupy a land and everyone should stay away is tough to reconcile because every land has changed occupiers multiple times throughout history.

In a couple of hundred years all races will interbreed and there will no longer be pure, or majority races. Even these Hawaiians aren't pure Hawaiian anymore. Maybe Samoans, or Tongans, or Maori, occupied the Hawaiian Islands and Hawaiians chased them away.

"As a Canadian... I'd say that isn't necessarily the case. The American reservation system, while an injustice, allows for a robust national identity since the indigenous groups were placed on single reserves.

Yesterday I wanted to know if a certain fingernail technique is still  fashionable. I tried all kinds of search terms and all they showed me was pages of curated websites with variations of 'the 10 best nail designs' and 'the 25 most eye catching nail styles'. Not one of them had the technique I was specifically looking for.

Lol I bet their fancy algorithm is basically 'strip away verbs and adjectives, show them paid results for the nouns'.

"AI will finally force people to develop some semblance of media competency (I hope) that fake news and botted articles apparently weren't already enough for.

Then technology will finally catch up and we will have tools that help us identify faked content (AIs can already reliably identify manipulated images and deepfakes) and verify trusted material (signatures, certificates, trust chains), so that we can distinguish what is real from what is fake/noise.

Eventually the oversaturation will lead to the death of standard platforms as we know them because they are too large to clean their tables.

"> go back to preferring real-life relationships and interactions

*sigh*. Every generation seems to say the *same* thing going back quite a while. You aren't special. I'm not special. The kids aren't special.

There was a point in time people avoided others and they called it ""reading hysteria"" and ""we need to get back to real-life interactions and relationships"". Sound familiar?

COVID showed us extroverts feel deeply entitled to these things and couldn't survive in a world they put introverts through. When you bottle these folks up they do all kinds of *STUPID* things - they're even willing to risk getting others hurt or killed just to engage in others because they can't stand it. Introverts have been dealing with this their entire lives and extroverts couldn't handle it for a small few years because they've been coddled.

Currently there's a huge social problem with ""real-life relationships"" in several countries and, honestly, I hope it causes a huge decline in birth rates. Society would rather force things than have uncomfortable conversations - especially places like Reddit - and honestly, we brought this on ourselves.

You act like people will magically just roll things back because of the fantasy of the ""good old times"" - sound familiar? Every generation says it.

For some - the Internet is their only outlet to meet like-minded people and then there are people like you who genuinely cannot comprehend such a thing. You're Big Mad that people can't be forced back into bars anymore and, instead, would rather just play video games or read or learn a new skill.

> maybe the internet dying is the best case scenario at this point.

For someone with your opinion - it's wild you're on Reddit so much specifically avoiding people.

Nah, the Internet allowed a group of people an outlet and a shit load of extroverts are bitter about it because they can't guilt people into leaving their house as easily anymore.

You exist because people with introvert genes found each other in real-life at some point (I’m aware it’s not 100% genetic).

>Various branches of the Israeli government as well as pro-Israeli civil society organizations engage in public diplomacy efforts:
IDF Spokesperson's Unit: The spokesperson's unit of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) plays a central role in the Israeli government's public diplomacy.[10] The IDF's English-language Facebook page is one of the most-followed army social media worldwide.[10] The unit has become Israel's largest spokesperson unit, with more than 400 officers, civilians and soldiers. There is also a reserve unit of almost 1,200 soldiers and officers.[11][10] As of 2017, the unit has 15 staff members that are responsible only for the IDF's social media platforms to reach audiences abroad.[12] As of 2015, the IDF is active on 30 different social media platforms.[12][13]
Spokesperson's Unit of COGAT: The Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the IDF unit responsible for coordination and liaison with the Palestinian Authority,[14] has a spokesperson's unit of its own as well as its own social media channels in English and Arabic.[15]
Prime Minister's Office (PMO): Within the Israel Prime Minister's Office, the Government Press Office (GPO), the Public Diplomacy Directorate and the National Information Directorate are involved in public diplomacy efforts.[16] The National Information Directorate is in charge of coordinating ""the public diplomacy activities of various governmental bodies in foreign and security affairs, and on socioeconomic issues"" (Israel PMO s.a.[further explanation needed]).[17][16] The Public Diplomacy Directorate is responsible for communicating the Prime Minister's and the government's policies and decisions.[16][17] The directorate is headed by the Prime Minister's Media Advisor.[16][17]
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA): The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a Public Diplomacy Directorate. ""The directorate consists of the Media and Public Affairs Division, the Division for Cultural Affairs and Scientific Cooperation and the Bureau for Religious Affairs and Relations with the Jewish Diaspora. The Media and Public Affairs Division comprises one department in charge of 'branding', a department in charge of collecting information, producing visual media content such as videos and drafting policy papers for briefing Israeli missions all around the world, as well as the spokesperson's bureau, which is in charge of the relationship with the press. Furthermore, the division also has an academic department and a small department dealing with issues of civil society affairs, especially the battle against BDS. Finally, the ministry has also a Digital Diplomacy Department, which is in charge of all digital channels of the ministry"".[16][attribution needed]
Pro-Israeli civil society organizations: Various civil society organizations and initiatives from Israel and abroad support the Israeli public diplomacy efforts.[18] Prominent examples are StandWithUs, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Christians United for Israel (CUFI), the Israel on Campus Coalition, the AMCHA Initiative and ""The David Project"".[19]
Masbirim Israel: In 2010, the Israeli Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched the PR campaign ""Masbirim Israel"". The campaign intended to encourage Israeli citizens to contribute to improving Israel's image by talking with their international contacts about the country.[20]

That does not make them right though..

"Why are you calling the entire holy land your ancestral land when your people are at best native to Judea. Their expansion out of Judea was based off of conquest and settlement. Why does Israel return tp Hebron when the old city is in a different place and built by the mamluks? It is indicative of wanting to return to a mythological instead of real land. The name for Palestine existed before the Romans and likely was used because they didnt want to name the whole area after one rebellious demographic, one that was actually a minority in the region. 




 As for genocide, with high profile israeli leaderd admitting to making Gaza unhabitable and the use of 2000 pound bombs in civilian areas, and strangling of aid, doctors reporting sniped children, a torture prison in the annals of history alongside abu ghraib, turbocharging west bank settlements, it leads to an aggregate effect that any reasonable person will foresee. Whether or not it is legal genocide is superfluous as it is an aggregious crime.

"Smartphone adoption was a big one, and the one that changed usage behaviors the most; Before smartphones going online used to be a dedicated activity, something you had to plan for, and then spent some time on.

You had to sit down at a computer/laptop, boot it up, dial in, launch a browser, and a lot of other effort and time invested just to ""get there"" because tech/bandwith also didn't used to be so fast.

And once you were there it was mostly a bunch of long text you had to read, everything took ages particularly more than text, the whole thing required *patience*.

Smartphones changed that dynamic massively, at least post WAP, suddenly going online wasn't this dedicated task anymore that locked you down at a desk for at least 5-10 minutes.

Now it's something people do when they just have 10 seconds of free time/boredom, that's enough to read a funny Tweet, watch a Vine/IG/TikTok.

But it's not enough to read a long text, it's not enough to delve into complicated topics and learn them, that takes the kind of patience [we are being conditioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) not to have anymore.

Another phase before that was the dot-com bubble, and before that the aforementioned Eternal September. 

Imho there was also another huge change post-smartphone but co-linked with the rise of modern social media.

Starting in the early 2010s was the actual rise of [state-sponsored astroturfing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks) and [botting](https://demtech.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/07/Troops-Trolls-and-Troublemakers.pdf) making full use of [legalized domestic propaganda](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/).",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ3WjJsSS1QTHVub090bEpFUWkxV3VKZmNtcUJIUWdBbUlFRUtyMGVvU19DYW1GSDIzMW81Uk9tc0FVazBiSjUxOUp3Qm5CaExtVGNtQ1VsZ3VVNHl1V3c9PQ==
"There is nothing ""edgelordy"" about it, it's admittedly a bit elitist but that used to be the nature of the medium *for the longest time*.

Dr. Rupin was addressing the convention of Austrian Zionists here. He emphasized that the Arab question can be solved only
economically, through cooperation between Jew and Arab in Palestine, and not through politics. 

Rejecting Mr. Zangwill's suggestion that there was a time when the Arabs could have been made to trek to some other territory, Dr. Rupin said,

""Remember the Palestine Arabs are descendants of the Jews of Old Palestine, converted to Islam"".

"Hey u/voprosy , people are not going to like the 10 minute thing. It doesn’t matter why, I can just share what I saw another documentary do which I thought was a fairly good strategy the yrfatfriend documentary that features Aubrey Gordon. Aubrey actually has a background in this kind of communication stuff, and she is incredibly passionate about organizing against anti-fatness. 

A documentary was released where, during a set period of time, people could watch the movie at half the price or something like that of what it would rent for. Then, based on demand from that, cities were selected for both screenings and releases of the film. It seems to be gaining momentum, and part of the success is the complete upfront communication around the cost and availability etc. 

The website [jolt film](https://www.jolt.film/about-joltspace) was their distribution company I think? I don’t know anything about this, and I’m going to pay for access to your documentary anyway but I think maybe a change of strategy for the general public may be a good idea? Obviously ignore me if I’m saying nonsense. Oh! The other thing I liked about the release for the documentary was that there was a tier pricing system; they had a “we break even” price, and I think two or three and maybe even a blank option? For people who could afford more and wanted to support? And now it’s available to be rented online. I’ve just been watching this campaign and I’ve found it very informative in terms of strategic engagement.

"Other than NY and a couple of other seriously large US cities, you'll find houses with yards which are for the most part larger than their European counterparts.

"And you'll find them in german cities as well. Just look at Hamburg or Freiburg. Most US cities have bigger plots for each house, true but that's for historical reasons. There has been a huge shift in European cities taking out parking lots and replacing them with green spaces. Also we have a lot of parks here in Germany and I think in Europe in general. But having bigger yards doesn't mean the whole city is greener. You... You do get that, right? 

I mean it's great that cities in the middle of the desert use up the ground water and dry up rivers to spray the grass lawns of their residents with water. If you think that makes the US somehow greener, fine. 

Also I don't know where you read that us cities have more bugs, I couldn't find any source for that. It's a ridiculous claim anyway cause you guys have vastly different ecosystems over there and you are on a different continent too so there are different bugs anyway. My only knowledge to this is that we have fewer bugs all around the world cause of pesticides. I even remember having watched a documentary about how some insect catching birds seem to do better in German cities than agricultural fields because of natural spaces in the cities. 

Is your SO from east Germany? Cause that would explain a lot.

October 7th was horrendous. There is insurmountable proof that everyone in Gaza was complicit. I don’t blame them for not having a single shred of empathy towards a group of people that wish to see Jews exterminated. I don’t cry for the children of Dresden.

"There’s also a difference between a small garden, and a farm. 

That’s beside the point, you completely missed…people pay to maintain a useless plant, while completely balking at a garden. 

Maintaining a yard is everything I said in my first post. Lawnmowers, weed eaters, leaf blowers, fertilizer, sprinkler system, water bills, herbicide…or, paying someone else to do those things…but you can’t even imagine not having your useless grass when someone suggests a garden instead. Doesn’t have to be a farm, lol. Even in that case, there are people that can utilize the land, take a portion of the yield, and give free produce to the person that owns/ lives on the land. Check out Curtis Stone on YouTube. 

It’s a different way of thinking about it. Most people are trapped into being a grass farmer because they’ve never tried to think outside the box…or, their HOA won’t let them. It’s a bad social custom, and it’s time we evolve.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1S1hfQjZmR2RHZ05rdWhlRGFPMURlUlFVQmQwVHV4M0hkSElZMnZhU08xbzg1RnFpVEc4RFBMbmdhYTdfM2QtYlkwLXlRTUpUNG1GTGZvNEw5NDhzVEYwOGNmcGU5Q1dHMU9VTkg3SW4ydnc9

"I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted.

It seems to be a very geographical thing in the US. 

Cities like Minneapolis, and Portland (and I’m sure there are others) had so much unique landscaping, permaculture, and gardening they really stood out when I visited. I saw similar land use when I’ve visited Europe. 

Americans are obsessed with grass, like they’re obsessed with big trucks and cars. They get really mad when you criticize those things, or even just suggest there are alternatives. 

The grass lawn is incredibly wasteful. People spend so much money  on equipment, fertilizer, landscaping, etc…for a plant they get mad if you walk on. It’s pretty weird when you think about it. They’re happy to pay people to maintain that plant, but can’t fathom paying someone to maintain a garden that would make them food.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1b0FTUnF5S2Nzald4Wjk0UUxsbmo5SVZTQU1RYVdWMUJXUDNXT3pmTkdjQkpDMm5mVzlZZmdjbEhVWDkzUGxrWHJrbzlrRUxwdldhMDNXRm1rd0hqaHpuQ2I2RXcyV0MtM2tUQUNGV0FZMU09
"That’s pretty aggressive for someone not being aggressive comment, homie. The absence of mentioning every yard in Germany doesn’t mean they don’t understand that…especially if they’re from Germany. Why get mad, and assume/ accuse someone of that from that simple comment?  Says more about your state of mind than theirs. 

Of course not every city, and area is the same. 

If you travel in Europe, or the states different regions have different aesthetics. In my personal travels, people’s gardens/ yards in Europe, and even people I know from other countries that live in the states now have a different philosophy. A lot of it becomes ‘when in Rome’ as it can be difficult to stand out in a neighborhood, especially if the HOA, or neighborhood disapproves.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1QW9wZWRwck5aMXExUkVCWkxDanpVZGU0MVF5cDhqQWZuNkxlb2YwbGNkMjVNQzR2bDZCWGdtYVg4bXNnZnJLRVF4a3VvdU1xTUdndThxd1JnVDBXZ1h1ajkyaUtlRk1uaDhtWWxfeUJuaTg9
"On top of the other guy, bamboo is not just a massive pita to deal with, it is also a significant hazard to the surroundings.

It grows much too fast and pressures other plants out of the niche. It is incredibly hard to get rid off, I mean that seriously. You essentially have to dig up the upper 80cm of soil *completely* and *without a gap*, burn it into ash, and watch over the barren soil for a year. If another bamboo shoots up, repeat. Only when you don't spot any bamboo for a season can you re-soil the area. If you let bamboo grow unattended, don't cut it regularly and don't pay attention for it to not spread to new areas, it can become an incredibly dangerous fire hazard. It *really likes* to burn. Considering its height and tendency to form fast-growing forests it can spread fires fast between houses and adjacent plants. You can even consider it its survival strategy to burn down other plants and then grow faster back than others.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY1SHU2ZVBUTUFES0VnSVRQcmd2TTl3VnliZUZTTHo1a3JaR2NWcDFmQnI1OS1BNVVVaVJxVnpLWTFIYXJaSGxVRjBhSEVyb1BBWGpaZ1BEb19LSEx6YXc9PQ==

"I believe the training materials should have been admitted and let’s let the court decide.

I will say the photo they showed in the documentary is a technique that is still trained today to handcuff someone. I am just watching this documentary and I am not seeing anyone say this. It’s an arm lock to wrist lock to get someone who isn’t cooperating to cooperate while handcuffing. Once they’re cuffed you relieve pressure and roll them into their side aka the recovery position. 

I don’t care how long EMS took to get there. I don’t care who was yelling on the side walk. Once someone isn’t fighting anymore you roll them on their side. GF wasn’t fighting anymore so roll him on his side. He starts fighting again use enough force to control him again. 

Why is this hard to understand from both sides!! 

I don’t think those cops woke up thinking I’m going to kill someone today but they sure were negligent with someone in their care. Lastly GF would cooperate as seen when told to sit down. Makes me believe he would have just laying down waiting on EMS. I don’t blame the officers for not believing him when he says he is claustrophobic in the back seat of a car. He was just in a car and there is also a thing called incarsaratius. Meaning people about to go to jail suddenly have a lot of health problems. It’s a real thing.

I listed exactly the stuff he actually did. Tariffs, tax cuts, over-aggressive foreign policy, etc.

The more outlandish stuff like building a border wall with Mexico paying for it, ending Obamacare, putting cartels out of business, prosecuting Hillary Clinton, or even releasing tax returns led nowhere. Which suggests strongly, that nebulous claims going forward are even less of an issue.

Here are two things that i feel a problematic with P25. First, i think it is hard to take any of P25 seriously when there are paragraph's like the one below on page 546 about Hunter Biden's laptop because it is immature and counterproductive to spend time and energy on someone not involved in the government and its policies. another example, Second, the notion that the death penalty is a deterrent to crime is absurd. Below is a paragraph about the death penalty from page 554. The lack of understanding of the criminal system by the P25 authors will lead to policies that will exacerbate the problem known as the School to Prison Pipeline unjustly impacting black and brown minorities.  


>Personnel within the FBI engaged in a campaign to convince social media companies and the media generally that the story about the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop was the result of a Russian misinformation campaign—while the FBI had possession of the laptop the entire time and could have clarified the authenticity of the source.   
**p546, Project 2025**

>Enforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable. Capital punishment is a sensitive matter, as it should be, but the current crime wave makes deterrence vital at the federal, state, and local levels. However, providing this punishment without ever enforcing it provides justice neither for the victims’ families nor for the defendant. The next conservative Administration should therefore do everything possible to obtain finality for the 44 prisoners currently on federal death row. It should also pursue the death penalty for applicable crimes—particularly heinous crimes involving violence and sexual abuse of children—until Congress says otherwise through legislation.

"In this gripping short film, we dive into the dark streets of Chicago’s South Side, where two high-ranking GDN members, Doom and Twinkle Toes, rose to infamy during the mid-2000s. Their story is one of loyalty, betrayal, and the rush of street warfare. As the BDs dominated the area, Doom and Twinkle Toes set out to prove that Jaro City, their GD-affiliated block, could be just as strong, if not stronger.

It all started when the duo got their hands on their first guns. What began as five drills a week soon spiraled into ten, sometimes with multiple hits a day. Known for their ruthless tactics, they often disguised themselves as bums or crackheads to catch their enemies off guard. Their primary target was the Calumet Building at 6217 S Calumet, a symbol of BD power, home to notorious figures like Lil Reese. They launched assault after assault, wreaking havoc on OBlock, Calumet, and Murder Drive, leaving bodies in their wake.

The adrenaline rush from their street warfare became an addiction for Doom and Twinkle Toes. They lived for the chaos, the violence, and the fear they instilled. Their names became legendary in the streets as they pushed Jaro City into the spotlight, forcing their rivals to take notice.

But the streets are a dangerous place, and trust is fragile. Twinkle Toes, who had a personal history with some BDs, believed he could flip them to the GD side. This decision would ultimately cost him his life. After being betrayed by members of his own crew and surviving a brutal attack that left him shot 18 times and blind in one eye, Twinkle Toes still attempted to broker peace with OBlock. But his past caught up with him, and he was killed in front of the OBlock gates near a famous restaurant on 64th and King Drive, allegedly by the very BDs he sought to trust.

With Twinkle Toes gone, Doom tried to carry on their legacy alone, but his violent ways eventually led to his arrest. His life ended in jail, marking the fall of Jaro City’s most feared duo.

This short film captures the rise and tragic fall of Doom and Twinkle Toes, showing how their hunger for power and reputation ultimately led to their downfall. Their story is one of ambition, the rush of the streets, and the heavy cost of living that life. Their legacy remains a haunting reminder of the consequences of choices made in the world of gang warfare.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdGUjBpRXkzdGQ5bWpRNUN6Yl91MXVUZlZUbVZxVTJBQ1poM2tMMzEyaXNuZmpkRWc0NFphUExiN2JJcS1sVUZXU0w0UUR0MTdhcnUxZ04waElYQWFteWc9PQ==

"As ""Brian Eno: The man Who Fell to Earth 1971-1977"" (2011 release; 157 min.) opens, We are immediately dropped into the founding of Roxy Music, of which Eno was an important member. The music of ""Rock-See"" reflected the ban's image and art-school background. Eno famously called himself a ""non-musician"". We then go back in to to Eno's upbringing and which artists influenced him. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.

Couple of comments: If you admire Eno's status as a record producer more than as an actual musician (like I do), this is documentary may give you second thoughts on that. Even though he called himself a ""non-musician"", he in fact was very much a musician (although he didn't much like going on tour). This documentary is in essence built on conversations with 4-5 talking heads who are Eno experts. I cannot evaluate how much on target they are, or not, but they certainly seem believable. A nice bonus is also the use of surprisingly ample archive footage from those days. It's not entirely clear to me why this documentary stops with the ""Before & After Science"" album, released in late 1977, and just before perhaps Eno's best known album, 1978's ""Music For Films"". Please don't be put off by the documentary's running time, well over 2 1/2 hours. It all passes by amazingly quickly. Now that I have seen this, I am going to check out the newest documentary on Brian Eno, 2024's ""Eno"", which has gotten stellar reviews.

I stumbled onto this documentary while browsing Amazon Prime to watch something, and based on my viewing habits, Prime suggested this. Thank you! Whether you are a big fan of Brian Eno, or simply interested in watching an interesting story on an interesting figure in the music world, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPWDNYa0ItdVlYYUdNU1o0QkdDZ1hKTWlKNWVPZUp0alFyWmhRR2NacmZLLXdLeDNMZm9yWDlJSDVpdEZyR3h2cllSSm02RkhkWnhRMTh4V2hvNXlLR2c9PQ==

"**In The Unknown Known, Errol Morris offers a portrait of Donald Rumsfeld, one of the key architects of the Iraq War, and a larger-than-life character who provoked equal levels of fury and adulation from the American public. 
Rather than conducting a conventional interview, Morris has Rumsfeld perform and expound on his “snowflakes,” tens of thousands of memos (many never previously published) he composed as a congressman and as an advisor to four different presidents, twice as Secretary of Defense.** 

**These memos provide a window onto history—not history as it actually happened, but history as Rumsfeld wants us to see it. Morris makes plain that Rumsfeld’s “snowflakes”—whether intended to elucidate, rationalize, obfuscate, or control history—are contradicted by the facts. [RADiUS-TWC]**

"This is a truly great doc, best watched in conjunction with its older sibling, [The Fog of War](https://dai.ly/xw68h9). Both films are an in depth and probing interview with a controversial US wartime Secretary of Defence.

The Fog of War focusing on the life and career of Robert McNamara,  one of the chief architects and promoters of the war in Vietnam; Donald Rumsfeld, one of the chief architects and promoters of the disastrous second Iraqi war, is the subject of The Unknown Known.

Morris is an intelligent, combative interviewer, and he came both times very well prepared. Each film has a gotcha moment- I won’t spoil those for you- but when I first watched them the Rumsfeld gotcha seemed a bit slight, the elegance and finality of it only becoming clear upon repeated viewing.

"This was a very interesting and informative documentary. It gives great insight into what happens in a factory town when the factory closes down and people are left scrambling to support themselves with jobs that don't pay half of what they were earning and don't provide benefits either.  Training for new job skills or going to trade schools barely helped either; the new jobs started at barely above minimum wage and offered little room for advancement, and the families' standard of living never really got back to where they'd been all those years ago.

"In the UK, the ONLY anti-gambling information and 'help' that is offered, is a small warning on gambling products that says 'When the fun stops, stop'

Catchy! I'll be sure to remember than when I'm in the depths of a binge.

I don't gamble. At all. But as was stated, one country - France - these companies get 60% of their revenue from problem gamblers. hat is shocking. That they dont care, they make SO much money and no doubt they are paying off and influencing policies and law. It's another legalised addiction like nicoteen. I don't know why they don't legalise drugs under the guise of health and safety and make money from problem drug users as well.. That actually would be better for everyone involved - taking money from cartels, terrorism and dealers, giving users uncut less dangerous drugs, reducing crime and helping remove the stigma enough for people to ask for help and get into treatment adn recovery.

But anway.. the unscrupulus nature and shady practices of legal gambling seems just as bad as illegal gambling. The fact that they can use money recovery services and TAKE people's property and harass them until they pay up - I think if you have an addiction, a genuine mental health illness - unable to stop - then debtsshould be written off and perhaps you be unable to 'log in' and gamble any more. It bankrupts people, people commit suicide, families are broken up, sentimental property lost and sold. In the UK, pawn shops like Cash Convertors obviously know that more than half the people that come in need the money for drugs or gambling.. you onlt have to look in the window to see stolen power tools, televisions, phones - electrical goods that are easy to sell. Nobody gets a fair deal at those place. I was forced to sell some items when I had overdue bills to pay immediately and a £1500 guitar I was offered £175, a synthesizier worth £3000 - was offered £200. I got these on buyback luckily so that I could recover my items when I was paid. But fuck.. they are part of the whole ecosystem of addiction. They make a fortune, exploiting desperation.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSX0VucDBGUDlaSURid2tvZ1Myd040VldaOVJGSDkwRnFlT3dIazE1RE40QlhVeFJDMUtSRzk3aXpEZEh5bXpZMGlvT3dMbVFMSUZfMkhtWm00eVQ4UHAxako0RVpWcWFjTjNUZnU0SVBNU1E9

"Night and Fog (1956 film)

1956 French film

Night and Fog (French: Nuit et brouillard) is a 1956 French documentary short film. Directed by Alain Resnais, it was made ten years after the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. The title is taken from the Nacht und Nebel (German for ""Night and Fog"") program of abductions and disappearances decreed by Nazi Germany.

Highness the Prince and Lord Nikola I Petrovic and the Golden Jubilee of H.R. Highnesses the Prince Lord and Princess Milena. On that occasion, Cetinje was visited by members of many European dynasties, above all because of the fact that marriages of Nikola's daughters made him the most famous European father-in-law. Among the participants were the Russian Grand Duke Nikolay Nikolaevich Romanov (special attention was drawn to the arrival of the Russian fleet to Bar) with his wife Anastasia-Stana, the daughter of King Nikola, the Italian king Vitorio Emanuel (with his wife Jelena, the second daughter of King Nikola), Count Franc Batenberg (with his wife Anne, third daughter of King Nikola), as well as Nikola's grandson, Serbian Crown Prince Alexander Karadjordjevic. The declaration of Montenegro for the kingdom was held in the hall of the Government House, followed by the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the marriage, the "" Golden Jubilee "" of King Nikola and Queen Milena. The ceremony ended with the defile of the Montenegrin war veterans, who, after the welcoming speech of serdar Rade Plamenac, have intimately surrounded their sovereign.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqbG05WXlWWTMxcWJEQm1kRmJmRG4tWC1VOW0zbTFnNi1QMWJYekRPakxwdS1BT0VfM0ZPYWNTSUFlSUJxdlRXTzJ2cUtNUFl2ZkstdDE1NTFYV1pJa09WbC1GNzM4ekgzNEdvUmpvOHRFbzQ9

"Submssion statement: Few had reckoned on this scenario: another Gaddafi vying for power. Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi is the second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi, who was killed in 2011. Now, Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi is a candidate in Libya’s presidential elections.  
  
Statements from relatives and political actors paint a portrait of an unpredictable and fiercely determined man. Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi’s presidential bid is a major challenge for Libya. The second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi has been convicted several times in Libya and is being prosecuted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.  
  
Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi has had an unusual life: he grew up a clan that operated with a high degree of paranoia, suspecting conspiracies at work everwhere. Later, he led a playboy lifestyle in Europe, presenting himself to the world as a reformer. In the second phase of his life, which began with the Libyan revolution of 2011, he perpetuated the repressive style of his father’s regime. He was taken prisoner by anti-Gaddifi militias who made him stand trial -- but only allowed him to take part via videolink.   
  
Everyone in Libya is talking about him, all kinds of rumors are doing the rounds, his life is under threat. People say he’s a crazy, sick mystic who’s absconded into the desert. What’s making him run for president, despite the death threats? Does he stand a chance of winning? What does he know about the secret machinations of his father’s regime? His eventful life mirrors the current chaos in Libya: a country divided, with one government in the east and another in the west, rival militias vying for power and foreign states influencing the conflict.

"New video I shot on Maui during a 5 day trip there last year.

Featured locations include:

* Haleakala Summit & Crater
* Wailea
* West Maui
* Lanai & Kaho'olawe
* Ma'alaea Bay
* Maui Ocean Center
* Molokini Crater
* Road to Hana
* Lahaina

Episode 4 of my cinematic travel series, ""Destination Hawai'i"", explores the magical island of Mau'i.    
  
In this episode, you'll ascend 10,000 feet to the summit of Haleakala above the clouds, marvel at the alien landscape, and witness the gorgeous Haleakala sunset.   
  
We'll also take a closer look at the geologic history of Mau'i and the surrounding islands that once formed Mau'i Nui in prehistoric times, as well as some notable features around modern day Mau'i.   
  
Experience the thrill of a Zodiac ride to Molokini Crater, and then strap on your snorkel for an underwater dive in the colorful reef.  
  
Brave one of the most scenic, and dangerous, highways in the world on the Road to Hana, and then become one with nature at Mau'i's ""Old Hawaii.""  
  
Our aloha to the victims of the devastating wildfires that destroyed the historic town of Lahaina in August 2023. Mahalo.

This is probably the oldest reddit post I have ever replied to and it looks like you haven't posted in a year so I don't know if you will even see this, I just wanted to say you are so kind and thoughtful to even think about this.

"Eh, it was some pretty weak evidence that was hammed up for the documentary. It didn't actually show that his amygdala was smaller. It showed that things that usually elicit a fear response didn't elicit one in him.

It doesn't mean he doesn't feel fear. But it's something where he likely was less susceptible to it, and has further trained himself to be able to ignore (as you have to while free soloing) it when necessary.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdrNVc1UFNoMGFzX1pTX1d1SlduczZjc0l1MkhFT1BfV3lDUzh2XzcydVcybVpKRkx6S0poczJkSzZYaXR4WEFfbldacFd2b1VBcGItLUZfSEd4QzZMSWxOQ2hVWlVURjVCR1hWTWJPbEZ3LW89

6:01 Not a statement of feeling more regretful.

8:41 yes, he's on the edge.

8:59 which is a very different statement from regretting doing it once

22:44 Of course. It's a lot easier to free solo when you can follow an experienced free solo who can coach you through it. That's more peer comforting than peer pressure.

Plus if you go and watch Magnus' reaction video later, it's quite clear that he doesn't regret doing it.

"> After so much thought they concluded that alex’s decision had nothing to do with the fact that it would be recorded and here alex is openly admitting that a large part of his decision was for the sake of the film pressuring him.

Huh? He said the exact opposite. That he waited much longer to gain even more confidence before attempting it because of the potential distractions of filming and because he didn't want to let them down.

And the difference between the el cap free solo and this one is that one is at the edge of Alex' ability level. He's really pushing the limits.

"> the dude accidentaly breaks a record on some rock that was actually held by Honnold. It's quite obvious that Marc didn't give any fucks about it.

I wouldn't say that's accurate. Marc wasn't specifically going for the record, but was going to a reasonably fast paced attempt to see how close he could come to the record.

"He's on a whole other level of risk taking. When Alex is pushing himself, he's doing in on rocks he knows well. He's climbed the exact route several times. Dirt is cleaned off of holds. Loose rocks in dangerous sections are removed and packed off the mountain.

What's great about Honnold is that he can control all that so tightly and push himself to the precise limit without crossing into uncontrollable risks.

Marc just shows up to a mountain and says, I haven't seen this before, but I'm going to try it. And I'm going to try it on on constantly changing terrain that I can't control.

"You obviously have not watched the video as its plain to see in the video, one police officer first verbally told him to stop as he was detained, he kept walking, then another had to guide him to the side and stop him, because he was unresponsive to the police officers orders the first time, the officer felt something was up and was within his right to order him pout his hands behind his back so that his weapon could be secured before they go any further with verifying any documents and verifying that everything was good.  But no, he had to literally rip himself away and run and pull a fucking gun on these cops full well knowing the situation he was in, if you think its ok to do that.

Ok did this really happen with Jesse too?? Because I'm reading recent court docs that say he might have been wrongfully convicted? Obviously the dad had a child porn problem.

"I've been rewatching the Paradise Lost documentaries on HBO, which explore the case of the West Memphis Three—three teenagers from Arkansas accused of the brutal murders of young children. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won’t spoil too much, but the crimes occurred in 1993, and the three documentaries were released in 1996, 2000, and 2011. 

While it's a true crime documentary at its core, Paradise Lost delves into broader themes like mass hysteria, faith, stereotyping, poverty, and the failures of the American education and justice systems. Be warned—this is not an easy watch. There are some graphic images of the murders, accompanied by the haunting music of Metallica, which adds a chilling layer to the experience.

"It's estimated between 1 and 5% of the population at any given moment in time have been wrongfully convicted this means that somewhere around the ballpark of about 2 million people are incarcerated for crimes they did not commit and are currently being exploited in a system they have no business being a part of. The fact that you're just chill about it again it's very telling about who you are as a person.

Beyond that, whats delusional is to believe that you can slap someone with a conviction of a crime and then give the general public access to such information and believe that society will allow them to function within it as normal. People make mistakes however even the smallest mistakes can ruin your life in this current system you're never given another chance you're never seen as having been rehabilitated you're never allowed to be something other than a criminal and because you're never given a second chance by this system most of these people turn back to a life of crime because they have no way out of the cycle.

"There's a very definitive line with SNL cast members between those who can act and those who are just funny.  They almost all come up in improv or these days youtube stuff, but they aren't necessarily good actors.  Will is a very good actor.  Some people are put off by his style of comedy, but if you look at his character work, he's pretty incredible, I think he just really enjoys being silly more than anything.  But shit, look at Ron Burgundy, Ricly Bobby, his roles in Stranger than Fiction and Everything Must Go.  It's masterful character work, he embodies the characters to the point that you kmow it's Will but you remember him as those characters, not just him.  That's really great acting.  I always think of Morgan Freeman as a comparison.  I love Morgan Freeman, but the only movie where I remember him as another person is Shawshank.  When he is in front of the parole board for that final time he was Red, without a doubt.  Pretty much everything else I see him in, he's just Morgan Freeman in a different setting.  Will is his character.

There are people who can act, and those who can't.  Will can, a lot of the people from SNL can't.  Most of them came up as comedians and then had to learn how to act after they got famous, and a lot of them just aren't good at it.  Its not their fault,  it's just a completely different discipline.

You brought up Sandler though, and I put him very solidly in the can act category.  When he gets serious it's pretty incredible.  Reign Over Me,  Spanglish, Uncut Gems, 50 First Dates.  The guy can tap into some heavily emotional stuff.  Like Will Ferrel, I think he would just rather live his being silly, but even in his silly movies he has a lot of moments where his ability to bring real emotion to his idiotic characters really shines through.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9QbzZkT1Z4YTRVOGNXRVZJWUJRM0hfOGI2ejNmUjI2eXI5MGQ1MU5xZjNBVjNDMFJteGpjMWlwNTVXRlc5eFVsY1RHWmdvOVJ4R2lCaFRsaHFtS0JYWWc9PQ==

"My best friend (best-man in my wedding) transitioned about 5 years ago.

I was very happy for her but… I’m not gonna lie, it hurt… a lot. I literally (and unexpectedly) went through something like a grieving process. I was very happy when she told me but I spent the next week “in my head” and had a really hard time for another week or so.

I’d unexpectedly never see “*my* best friend” again (which I just wasn’t prepared for), and I haven’t even met *her* since she left our friend group pretty abruptly and just stopped interacting with me, in general. She has a new life, I guess.

I say all that just to say, *I’d kill* for a chance to road trip with her, meet her, re-befriend my old/new friend who’s now *living her best life*… but she kinda cut me off.

"One of the big things that happens with major life changes is that we lose people or expect to lose people. Whether it's having kids, moving far away, transitioning...it's something a lot of folks prepare themselves so much that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy almost. 

And NGL, it is scary af to come out to the people closest to you, not knowing how the start of your journey will end and in a lot of cases not knowing whether or not you can actually do it. The beginning of doing it (transition) is super chaotic...not that it's an excuse but sometimes it can add up. 

I'll stand in for your friend on this one and just say that...I'm sorry that you were left behind. It would have been easier for your two's friendship if you were there for the journey. I know it hurts and I don't think that was her intention. Even still...I'm sorry. Its never too late to reestablish what was once there. This trailer even is a good starting point to have this conversation and to be honest about your desire to get to know her better. Keep in mind I'm also the weirdo that will throw myself into awkward situations just to catch people being real, or to make sure I play my hand and not regret being cautious ten years down the line. 

It's not without some risk to how you remember your relationship...but I genuinely thing this might be worth a play if you feel that strongly about it.

"No. I am not calling it a genocide because of the holocaust. How does that make any sense? 

Genocide is defined as the destruction of a people, either in whole or in part. Israel is destroying and displacing the Palestinian people. Approximately 40,000 out of the nearly 2.3 million have been killed. That number continues to rise. About 90,000 have been injured. This includes so many children who are now amputees. Most of them have also been displaced. 1 out of 6 Palestinians have been killed as far as we know. Let’s put that into perspective, since 40,000 might not seem like a lot “in a war.” One sixth of the U.S. population is approximately 55.5 million. 

Israel continues to displace, detain, injure, torture, rape, murder, and psychologically destroy the Palestinian people.

"Damn. Thank you. Really.

I tried hard to remind myself that she didn’t have to tell me and I can’t imagine how hard it was for her because she (we) did lose a friend or two (phobic) from this.

But you pointed something out that I hadn’t thought about: he/she was my best-man, essentially, giving me away to new best friend. And after that, my life started to *go*; new wife (probably seen as closer to me than her), new job, moved, another state, a new home, a kid, etc. so maybe she quietly grieved my perceived distant (not in contact but in *life*) or maybe I didn’t even noticed that I was a bit more detached. Maybe he felt like *he’d* lost me. (Idk whether to use “he” for the time he was, or not… I’ve never done it *to* her - only now in text - but maybe I unintentionally said something wrong. Thinking out loud.)

Honestly, I think her and I need to re-connect, not even as best friends but just two people whose lives have progressed. More of a catch up. I’ll try to plan a FaceTime with her (and not just surprise-call her cause… I really don’t like talking on the phone anymore… and maybe that’s a vibe I was unintentionally putting off).

"Iraq was thought at the time to be a war on terror as a result of 9/11. The US Army then maintained a presence in the area after Saddam’s downfall in order to stabilize the area. Let’s make one thing clear - what happened in Iraq was horrible. You can certainly draw parallels between the raping, torturing, and mental war waged back then. The US went there to supposedly fight terrorism. 

Take the genocide of Kurds for example, a key event being Halabja. This may require some research to understand historically the position the Kurds have been in. Long story short, they occupy a region in four countries, one being Iraq. Just like Palestinians, the Kurds to this day are persecuted and are actively oppressed in some parts of the region (like turkey). During saddam’s regime, he indiscriminately and specifically targeted the Kurds. He bulldozed and bombed villages, he displaced people, he imprisoned and tortured and raped them, inflicted generations of trauma on them. That’s how it’s similar to Palestine. The US wasn’t in Iraq to do that, fucked up as their involvement was. Netanyahu and Israel are doing what happened to the Kurds to Palestine. They’ve been doing it for decades; this goes back way before October 2023. Look at a map of Palestine since 1950 to now and look at how much land was forcibly stripped from Palestinians. Villages bulldozed. Families leaving in the morning and coming back to find their homes were taken by Israelis. The nakba. And now this past year has been the worst. So many Palestinians have been displaced. And when they finally make it to refugee camps, they are targeted there as well. Reports estimate that more children have been killed in Palestine this past year than in four years of world conflict on average. And the craziest part is that this is arguably the most well-documented genocide in history. Every day there are reports, pictures, videos, so on, evidencing what Israel is doing. A good example is the video of the camp where Israeli soldiers or security forces hid a man behind their riot shields and took turns raping him. 

If all of this isn’t enough for you to open your eyes and see what Israel is doing is wrong, I don’t know what else to say. We’ve been debating whether it’s a genocide or not. What it should be labeled as is the least important thing, and it does not at all change how horrible the situation is.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9RUUlHTGQ0QXZxN0tyaWhaNER3WFQ5SW90S0NsV1kxa1A3YndQeldHMkdIQmMyOUFERDVuWHlmNmxjak1TdFotN2lfVVJpTWVKVGQ2blY4QjcwRlQ3ckE9PQ==
So the USA killed more kids but it’s justified to fight terrorism? 10/7 wasn’t terrorism.

I never said Iraq was justified? You’re just taking one or two little things I say out of context and only replying to those parts. After the US and other countries helped Jews move back into Israel there has been constant conflict. I think there’s an argument to be made as to who has claim to the land. I just don’t see how you can read everything I just said about what happened this past year and then justify it? You have nothing to say about how many kids are being killed? Nothing to say about the Palestinian detainee raped on video? Nothing to say about the fact that Israel blatantly targeted the World Food Kitchen convoy working in Gaza? Nothing to say about Israel killing activists from the US? Stop deflecting and answer how you’re ok with all of that.,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9RR29QT1VQTEpRelJNZlprcnFZUngtZkF4SG9JSkh0b0tkV3I0blhENTJxRmNtQkltMm54dmtpMXowTVdxekg0NnQ2bmFwRlQ2alN4TzNsSm9jRUlQYUE9PQ==

"Based off of one conversation you’re assuming other conflicts aren’t important to me? Lol. You haven’t made any effort to address my questions. Every time you say “why is this one so important” you just continue to deflect. There are 100 reasons why this one is so important to me. Just like there are 100s of reasons why the situation in the Congo, and in Sudan, and in other places are important. There is no limit to my empathy. And the fact that war happens is not a fucking reason to waive off what’s happening in Gaza. It’s not a fucking war. It’s a one-sided genocide. The IDF, supported in large part by the US both economically and otherwise, is committing murder, torture, rape, and displacement daily. You want to know how we know how one-sided this conflict is? Look at people in Israel and how comfortable their day to day lives continue to be.

"I’m gonna drop some documentaries not mentioned yet that are hands down my all time favorites:
“Dark Days” A cinematic portrait of the homeless population who live permanently in the underground tunnels of New York City. (Tubi)
“TV Junkie” Rick Kirkham was a successful TV reporter, and could have been a major U.S. television profile if it hadn’t been for his massive drug and alcohol abuse. Kirkham filmed his life every day with a video camera from the age of 14 years. On the basis of his video material the story of his life is told in this documentary. (Prime)
“Life of Crime 1984-2020” A relentless ride through the streets and prisons of Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, and desperate fight to survive the deadliest enemy ever to attack America. (Max)
“The Panic in Needle Park” Follows the lives of heroin addicts who frequent “Needle Park” in New York City. (Try documentaryheaven.com)

Not by Israel. 2% of the population was already confirmed dead in Gaza months ago, not counting the disappeared people under the rubble. Israel doesn't report any data, and they accepted the statements from the ministry of health in Gaza, but they're no longer able to do so. Current estimations from medical organizations claim that 5-10% could be dead by now if you factor the rate of violence, famine and epidemies. 

There's not a single US ally that has engaged in such brutality in such a short amount of time in recent history. Israel hasn't declared any end goal or any plan if they were able to achieve their alleged military goals. It's extremely disturbing but considering the Western reaction and the intentions of Israel it's possible Gaza ends up being reported as a genocide by future historians.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9ZZHp0ZnhZRzg1MV84RUlrX2NVbW55NVRGZWlSd0d4MU1weU9WLU9FVlBKTnRnY0ZRTEd2WkFlSi10VXNFYUxCNElFMngtWE5DV0ZVV0V2Qjg0YVBJX0E9PQ==

"The US is an economic jurisdiction in which the aforementioned lobbies pressure legislators to invite more dependents for the sake of profit and insulation while domestic industry is off-shored due to foreigners' accesses. Perhaps the current presidency can be seen as a microcosm, or used as a heuristic at least perceptually, being that there really isn't one. 

""State"" suggests that there is a leader, elected representatives, or at the very least a bureaucracy of ""officials"" organizing things, but you don't know who makes the 1500 pages of pork that the well paid ""legislators"" vote on within an hour of their introduction, and you don't know exactly who are making day to day decisions in the executive if the president is on his 400th day of vacation while completely senile (this is not controversial anymore). 

I think based on the claims of various congressmen and women over the past 20 years or so, most recently with Thomas Massie's descriptions of handlers within congress, and /u/Hottage's simple description of the US's most powerful and monied lobby, that it's fair to say that the US is a client, not a state -- or client state if you prefer.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aQmpxak5LTG5fWDVJbDFNQ3dlNVUyT2dPSEZVakViNkFRVHlPS1B0N3dPXzdJYm9wMTVMR0VETnNpUkpiN2lnNFlGc05lMS1HQXFIYjdXUlRGWGFfanc9PQ==

"Nevermind that the Israel lobby, it's foremost organization being at AIPAC, is larger than the military industrial complex in terms of lobby groups, in every measure not just the money. 

This explanation from the other poster avoids saying that Israel controls the largest slices of American government by suggesting that there is a simple confluence of monied interests in the form of semi-elected arms dealers. 

>so it’s basically a win win for the US and Israel since Israel gets more weapons and the US gets money into their economy.

So, the US gets a shallow rebate on the sale of material goods ... not the purchase but the sale - I give you ten dollars, I also give you this squirt gun. You give me $5 for the gun. I just made $5. win-win for sure. This is what the cyclops Zionist Dan Crenshaw said about the matter a few years ago too, when he was asked about why the US seems beholden to Israel, and this was well before they were put in the spotlight with this Gaza stuff.  

____

You can [start here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/03/06/the-dark-roots-of-aipac-americas-pro-israel-lobby/), and while it's not the best article I figure the ""authoritative"" source offers some legitimacy. 

Congressman Thomas Massie [very recently described how the Republican side of congress at least](https://youtu.be/2ieJkvkPU9M?t=17) has Israeli handlers assigned to everyone but himself. 

[Cynthia McKinney talked about what happened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC8pJvY8Wdo) when she ran into the Israel lobby when it came to US policy and Israel. Good rhetoric in the beginning, but relevant parts at 2:30 and 3:40. 

[""The most expensive House primary in history""](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/20/nyregion/aipac-bowman-latimer.html) was entirely the focus of something that **isn't** the constituency, the district... it had nothing to do with America. That's effectively a foreign nation's candidate.

Imagine gaggles of Vladimirs and Dmitris controlling committee and subcommittee funding through organized groups not registered with FARA etc., setting record breaking money numbers in the attacking and supporting of House candidates on the explicit basis that their government position is or is not good for a foreign nation, and one which operates principally within the relevant institutions of the United States. 

Nixon candidly remarked upon his realization that the Jews in government were all spies (sorry, I can't get the clip because every outlet laser focuses on a short, out of context and incomplete phrase that suggests Nixon was simply targeting Jews for no apparent reason). He describes the [Jewish lobby.](https://youtu.be/LEpPk1BBFP8) Okay, look. That's not me saying it, that's not some weird alt-right political commentator, or catholic pseudo fascist zealot or some shit. Consider what he says privately and candidly, and as compared perhaps to how he says it publicly. I think that immense evidentiary weight has to be afforded to those closest to the events, and considering the candid nature of the first clip, things seem kinda spooky. I look at The Project for a New American Century and the Clean Break ""memo,"" and look at who is involved in that, and it's not the CEO of Haliburton, but a bunch of Zionists. Well, I don't know that they're Zionists necessarily, but the term is trending, and if I said there was a pattern of Jewry it would elicit memories of Hitler. 

But hey according to others this happens because people like Nikki Hailey or some shit, form a revolving door between Congress and Lockheed Martin, and the handful of them are able to influence to the point of total control, the rest of congress because they like money and for some reason, this particular Israeli avenue is the best source of it (not for especially untoward reasons, but because like arms dealing or whatever). The tail is **not** wagging the dog according to /u/liorza3. In fact, the dog wags the tail and there's nothing more to consider.

Yeah, I don't hide shit on Reddit. My life isn't going great. I went from building up a house to drilling my own goddamn teeth out. 

Sounds great! /s

A large part is because my small business, that was doing very well, was raided. They took over $10k in hardware from me. I lost almost all of my biggest clients ONLY because they heard about how my house got raided. 

There is one person, that I'm aware of, who knows why I was raided. Her name was Dawn. She showed up from the ""cybercrime division"" and tore my house apart. 

Literally every cop in town was at my house, and when they realized I had more than two SUVs worth of computer equipment and they brought six more from neighboring towns. I knew them. I knew their kids, I helped them see up their goddamn TVs. Didn't matter. 

Not one other person knew why they were there. I just started asking them every time they came by, admittedly being kind of an ass, why they were there. No fucking clue. 

Only two even recognized my references to ""just following orders"" and ""do you know what Nuremberg means?"". On the bright side, they honored my request to bring my wife to another room.

Dawn refused to tell me why she was there, only presenting a warrant for the confiscation of all media and storage devices. Then proceeded to take fucking brand new motherboards, processors, and RAM still in their *original packaging* and throw them in glorified garbage bags. 

I started to recover, despite losing insane amounts of inventory, and now the rumors are around again. I'm losing customers. 

Thing is, I've done illegal stuff! I sold a lot of weed in college, for one. But I don't even know why they took basically everything. 

They took both of my phones (personal + business), laptops, desktops, and even clients' computers. They proceeded to take every device my wife owned, including a fucking smartwatch. 

It's been 2.5 years now. Even though there's nothing on my record, I can't get an interview anywhere. So I'm stuck ""running my own business"" with half of my clients at best.

"(2/2)

**West Bank**:  
To me, the settlements are indefensible. Some people are on the fence or defend--I disagree with them. They should be dismantled, settlers can be relocated to Israel or leave them to the consequences of their actions with a full IDF withdrawal in and around the settlements. I know this isn't policy, I don't have a say in how the government operates, I'm just saying this is my position. Their actions are immoral, illegal, and an obstruction to peace with the Palestinians.   
  
That is not, however, the end of the story. In the Israel-Palestinian conflict, there are two parties with agency, a fact many people seem to casually ignore or conveniently forget. A full civilian withdrawal will still require outside security in the WB until Hamas/PIJ are dismantled and [Iranian weapons smuggling](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/09/world/middleeast/iran-west-bank-weapons-smuggling.html) can be prevented. The [UN is feckless as exemplified by failure to enforce 1701](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701), Abbas is hopelessly corrupt, and the PA is all-but powerless. A unified PA-Jordanian-SA or something of the sort security service would be ideal (even though the PA does have major problems, [pay for slay ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palestinian-pay-for-slay-hamas-oct-7-israel-gaza-antony-blinken-ramallah-2dce9a22)being a good example). The model would be analogous to the Allies post-WW2 presence in Berlin, facilitating deradicalization and development. Pipe dream. Israelis likely wouldn't trust that structure, Jordanians have no interest in further entrenching themselves given their [history with Palestinians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September) in their country, and SA is too far away to reasonably care beyond thoughts and prayers.   
  
But any objective outside observer can see exactly what would happen with a full military withdrawal from the West Bank, because that exact thing happened in Gaza in 2005. Hamas would take over violently and there would be an inevitable war with Israel, which would very likely eclipse the current war in terms of civilian death toll. That is a horrible, horrible, horrible, nightmare scenario. I don't have the solution, but I sure as hell don't want to see that outcome.  

>Not to mention that ""if we dismantle apartheid we will be driven to the sea."" was also the go-to defense of apartheid South Africa.

From the River to the Sea is the *literal rallying cry* of every Palestinian and Hamas supporter, and Hamas has demonstrated in word and deed what this means: the murder and subjugation of all Jews. Look at how many Jews are left in Lebanon (29), Syria (4), Iraq (10), Yemen (5), and Egypt (20) to see what happens when Arabs take over Jewish populations. Incidentally, Gaza has the most Jews of any of the surrounding countries! (although, to be fair, they're all hostages and the majority are dead).",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTBzenZXaWdvNHBxcXpTN3dWVThFSHpDdW5mbFktaFBqN1lTRWNMSnNjZkdudFZLbllPNTJRaFdULWZYYlJvRjVDb29UUFRta2RtWWl0T1M1N3dXckMtdlluSUhRc3FMNWxFMEx1QjVFc2o5VVU9

"Yeah, the first line in the original Likud charter is ""from the river to the sea there will only be Israeli sovereignty"". This is decades before Hamas was founded. Netanyahu held a map recently at the UN erasing Gaza and WB showing only Israel from the river to the sea. This is without even looking at proto-Zionists like Jabotinsky and the Etzel who even viewed Jordan as part of Israel.

It's not only disingenuous to present ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"" as a call to genocide but it's also extremely hypocritical. Anyway, this slogan being genocidal is purely your interpretation. Others view it as a genuine call for freedom and as call to end the oppression. There's nothing inherent in it that is violent towards Jews.

Hamas isn't the root problem as much as you'd like to believe it. We can analyze the 40 years before they were founded and see how Palestinians were constantly uprooted and denied basic rights by Israel. We can also look at how things are looking the Palestinian Authority governed WB.

Presenting Arabs as inherently genocidal towards Jews is also bad faith considering that Jews lived in large numbers for thousands of years amongst Arabs. It's only when the Zionist started colonizing Palestine that relations started to sour very dramatically. This isn't to excuse the genuine atrocities and expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Jews who in no shape or form deserved that. But it's important to keep things in perspective. You also have 20% Arabs in your country who could genuinely destroy it or cause irreversible damage if they were really genocidal. I think the Palestinian citizens of Israel are the best demonstration to how Palestinians can be genuinely peaceful and cooperative if they're given more breathing room. It's a shame that Israel doesn't see that and learn from that. Anyway, no one is telling you to live under Arab rule. Just to let Palestinians breathe a bit.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTBzUW9ab2RrLURWNHZhUDJrSHhkd0RSSVZjOUhtdy1femFZTVdfVWJMREFSZVhVOHRzdEVpN3hlWGlWOThVOHJaY0d5VmhzZ2J1X01iaERNSzR0ZXA4RWc9PQ==

"Re: Likud charter--I in no way agree with this. I've been anti-Netanyahu for well over a decade, before most people even knew his name, because he has done nothing but sabotage any prospect for peace. River to the sea from anyone is disgusting. 

>It's not only disingenuous to present ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"" as a call to genocide but it's also extremely hypocritical. Anyway, this slogan being genocidal is purely your interpretation. Others view it as a genuine call for freedom and as call to end the oppression. There's nothing inherent in it that is violent towards Jews.

  
The English slogan comes from the Arabic original (still chanted today) which translates to ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be Arab."" It is an explicitly genocidal call. That protesters in the West are unaware of this and just find the rhyme catchy does not matter--they are promoting an explicitly genocidal call and cause. 

>Hamas isn't the root problem as much as you'd like to believe it. We can analyze the 40 years before they were founded and see how Palestinians were constantly uprooted and denied basic rights by Israel. We can also look at how things are looking the Palestinian Authority governed WB.

Hamas was founded in 1987 so if we're using the 40 years before then we're reverting back to the ""original sin"" of Israeli independence, at which time the West Bank was Arab-controlled territory that participated in the intended war of destruction that turned out to be Israel's war of independence. The original attempt of making the river to the sea Arab. 

They declared a war of annihilation on Israel even when the land was theirs exclusively, so it's pretty rich to suggest that opposition began with Israel's control of the land. 

>Presenting Arabs as inherently genocidal towards Jews is also bad faith considering that Jews lived in large numbers for thousands of years amongst Arabs. 

You're right, they were only genocidal towards Jews once the Jews had a state, which doesn't really have anything to do with the unaffiliated Mizrahi Jews where were living in Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, etc who were all expelled, violently. Per previous comment, current Jewish population in most of those is in the single digits.   
  
And to suggest that there was peaceful coexistence (which you are not stating explicitly, but implying) is likewise disingenuous given the degeneration of Jews as dhimmis to [antisemitic violence/frequent pogroms ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Ottoman_Empire#Antisemitism)in the 100+ years before Israel's founding as they embraced their Jewish identity. 

>You also have 20% Arabs in your country who could genuinely destroy it or cause irreversible damage if they were really genocidal. I think the Palestinian citizens of Israel are the best demonstration to how Palestinians can be genuinely peaceful and cooperative if they're given more breathing room. It's a shame that Israel doesn't see that and learn from that. Anyway, no one is telling you to live under Arab rule. Just to let Palestinians breathe a bit.

Not my country. And I'll flip your argument on its head: Palestinians in Israel are peaceful and cooperative because they are free Israelis who aren't brainwashed and led by radical Islamic jihadism. When Palestinians are peaceful, there is no cause for suppression or violence, but rather integration. When they are violent, they are met with violence and isolation (which is not just an Israeli phenomenon--see: Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon). In point of fact, if you'll read Israel's Declaration of Independence, it explicitly welcomes Arabs to live in Israel *in peace*. 

>Anyway, no one is telling you to live under Arab rule. Just to let Palestinians breathe a bit.

I wish that were the case. From the river to the sea is a clear and explicit call to have Jews live (and mostly die) under Arab rule. 

Palestinians deserve more than just to ""breathe a bit"" as I'm sure you know. The deserve full liberation, freedom, dignity, peace, safety, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, they (which is to say their leadership and the terrorists who support them) always choose suicidal violence, and those actions are always met with greater violence, so nothing can happen until Hamas is defeated and extremism eliminated.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0Tkl5MWNHX2xvd053ZTd1d29PMEFqbW9Lc3ZDZ1l1SkNWUllVYmFvbWFNYk9acFFBd1NidWZwWVk1U1lGbkk4em5RRldIcjFHTHJtZ0hrWTVuYXRPOEFCR2RHRzBqeWctZWNqckk2S2JxMnM9

"I keep thinking that some day, as a companion to documentaries such as this, there will be a series that sets out to tell the story of all of the insane ways unleashed authoritarianism invaded our lives in the aftermath of these attacks. 

The “war on terror” that came into existence and never left. The birth of “homeland security” and the patriot act. The birth of TSA, rifling through our belongings day and night ever since. The invasion of Iraq, of course, and the militarization of police across the nation in equipment, training, and mentality. The ballooning use of private security across every sector of society, and the new markets for tactical gear and arms. Not to mention the sudden radicalization in politics and entertainment (and Murdoch’s amplified conflation of the two). And so on and so on and so on.

Bullshit. The original slogan is ""Min al-nahr ila al-bahr, Filastin sa-takun hurrah"" which translates to ""from the river to the sea Palestine will be free"".

>Hamas was founded in 1987 so if we're using the 40 years before then we're reverting back to the ""original sin"" of Israeli independence, at which time the West Bank was Arab-controlled territory that participated in the intended war of destruction that turned out to be Israel's war of independence. The original attempt of making the river to the sea Arab.

>They declared a war of annihilation on Israel even when the land was theirs exclusively, so it's pretty rich to suggest that opposition began with Israel's control of the land.

We can look at how Israel treated Arabs within the 48' ceasefire line after Israel was founded and when Palestinians were incapacitated and had no political leadership, neither Hamas nor the PLO existed back then. Yet military ghettos, ""absentee"" properties theft even of people living inside the green line happened at a massive scale. Examples of massacres against helpless Palestinians include the [Kafr Qassim massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Qasim_massacre).

Israel ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the Nakba before the surrounding Arab states intervened. Plan Dalet came before surrounding Arab states intervened and Israel had already depopulated approximately 200 villages by the time that happened.

>Palestinians in Israel are peaceful and cooperative because they are free Israelis who aren't brainwashed and led by radical Islamic jihadism. When Palestinians are peaceful, there is no cause for suppression or violence, but rather integration. When they are violent, they are met with violence and isolation (which is not just an Israeli phenomenon--see: Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon)

Well, then why doesn't Israel try to integrate more Palestinians? It's because they care more about being a Jewish ethno-state than being a democracy.

> Unfortunately, they (which is to say their leadership and the terrorists who support them) always choose suicidal violence, and those actions are always met with greater violence, so nothing can happen until Hamas is defeated and extremism eliminated.

Already debunked by the fact that Palestinians have been getting continuously screwed regardless of their leadership and regardless of their politics. We had a period between 48 and 67 were there was no Hamas and no PLO and no leadership. It was still a brutal apartheid regime and helpless Palestinian civilians were still ethnically cleansed.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB1dGpoTS1XWFBUOTdXel9zNHlzZmhuNTZMcGNyeE44WVJZSVgzWXFSajdJbmx3SE5YeHhDdnh1MEp4aVo2S05uN1MxMG9HNV9aR0tuUENCMjRWX25TSFE9PQ==

"A loved one was recently buried in the same cemetery as a group of the Columbine victims. The victims are buried in a half-circle of tall black crosses in grassy island in the back of the cemetery. Separate from everyone else out of respect but also because any surrounding plots would be unsellable.

Even with the care that went into planning their resting place, it stills feel like impossibly not enough. That this couldn’t be it but for such a heinous tragedy. But what would be enough?

One of the killers is also buried there in a marker-less grave. I suppose I can understand the cemetery giving the parents that bit of grace. But the most I would have offered was cremation. 

Like others have said, true crime “journalists” have found every way to subtly valorize these vile young men, often through the thin-veil of well-intentioned pop psychology. But the killers do deserve not that and I suspect the journalists have blood on their hands for perpetuating their legends.

I watched the One Day In America doc yesterday and it made me want to explore and understand my memories of that day more.

"“Silenced” is a good one I watched this week. It’s only available on X or on a website called Rumble as it is banned in the UK due to libel action.

He is currently holed up in Cyprus apparently and faces arrest when he comes back to the UK for releasing the documentary after a court ordered him not to.

"School Life 2015


This observational documentary follows a year in the lives of two inspirational teachers at Headfort, the only primary-age boarding school in Ireland. Housed in an 18th century estate, school life embraces tradition and modernity. For John, rock music is just another subject alongside Maths, Scripture and Latin, taught in a collaborative and often hilarious fashion. For his wife Amanda, the key to connecting with children is the book, and she uses all means to snare the young minds. For nearly half a century these two have shaped thousands of minds, but now the unthinkable looms: what would retirement mean? What will keep them young if they leave?

"To start the industry is grossly under regulated when it comes to safety/training/certifications. 
Regardless of what NWSA has done since 2016 there is still no current accredited apprenticeship program to legitimately teach Tower climbers their job. Another aspect is corporate greed, the race to the bottom contracting scheme ( The Tier System) one of the main reasons why Tower climbers are paid so poorly is because of this. Another reason is that they are not recognized as a skilled trade such as an ironworker or electrician. 
If you worked that many years as a tower climber, you know as well as I do that we do so many different jobs. There are good companies out there, but they are very few and far between generally speaking across-the-board so many things need to be better and can be better for an industry that is so essential to the world and every day life.

"No, they would be correct. 

If we're being technically accurate, there are 8 planets, and as many as 200 dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt, and possibly upwards of 10,000 beyond the Kuiper belt. For little kids learning about the solar system, there's a limit to what we expect them to know and memorize.

In the strictest sense, dwarf planets are not planets. In this context, putting ""dwarf"" in front of the term does not mean it gets to be included in the ""planet"" category.

If Pluto is a planet, then so is Eris, and Sedna and Quaoar and Haumea, and for that matter, Ceres. Eris is 27% larger than Pluto, for example. The problem, though, is that all of these have not cleared their orbits, and their orbits can cross one another. To astronomers, this was a problem, because when categorizing things, you clearly have the planets we knew about prior to Pluto's discovery, and then we have all the other objects that are a lot like Pluto and not at all like the the big round things that clear their orbits.

So if Pluto is a planet, then we can't be sure about the number of planets there are in our solar system: we're still finding new trans-Neptunian objects.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkbHUzTWhNNUgyQlN5NVRPeEFJMndrXzNVR1FMZ041OWFzeGhlMWFMV0RndEVEWW1kWG5BNlY3MnQxZk5GOVJ5Q0RGTGtzZk5HeEFhdm5wSThIdXlpQVE9PQ==

I don’t know how many dwarf planets there are off hand but sure.  I think the crux of the issue is that people want a hard definition of the number of planets for some reason but our solar system has so much more going on that just being like “oh 8 things” is so dismissive but that is where the entire drama around Pluto starts.,r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkTklWc2F0c2x3OEp3RVlrY1BSamcxZkJCYzV1Q1E1Q1dZaHVYcUVqLWJhX1RKZDNxTEkxMmZMYjVhQ2VWWktKeTM0UUVBYk94SGtObE1hTi1LTU9LSWc9PQ==

"TIL - “No nerds, no birds” was a slogan by Boeing Engineers to emphasize the essential role of engineers (“nerds”) in designing airplanes (“birds”). It reflects the idea that without skilled engineers, the company wouldn’t be able to build its aircraft. This slogan became relevant in discussions about Boeing’s changing corporate culture, particularly after the merger with McDonnell Douglas in the late 1990s. 

Critics have argued that Boeing shifted focus from engineering excellence to financial priorities, sidelining its engineers in favor of management decisions driven by cost-cutting and profit maximization. This cultural shift is seen by some as a factor that contributed to the safety issues with the 737 Max. The phrase, originally meant to celebrate engineers, ironically highlighted how sidelining their expertise in favor of business objectives can have serious consequences.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FlQVJBUXN4a0Y0SzdrUUR2M1BraTdnSlR6ZHI2Y2R3eFVmbFBnZktLZjF4YVdFZ3JWTUFCZ1JUTFZQeWxpTU1LaUgyODZ2X3hldlR3SVFEajBxNWZUZVE9PQ==

"What's depressing is the fact that the majority of those facilities are not prisons or jails, but residential juvenile detention centers, and foster care overflow.

See, when foster kids don't have anywhere to go the state has to put them somewhere and if they have any kind of behavioral issues then they can put them into residential placement and the state pays Corrections Corp of America a pretty penny for housing foster kids.

It's far more financially lucrative to put a kid in a facility and make a buck off that live body than it is to make sure these kids end up in good homes with good people. Prison works on the same model and these kids aren't even allowed to speak in most of these facilities. They live in full lockdown.

"The Deathbed Vigil. When Apple was still only black and white and IBM computers displayed 16 colors, the Commodore Amiga was ahead of its time with 4096 colors, stereo sound, co-processors for audio, video, and peripherals, and a full preemptive multitasking operating system. Sadly they went bankrupt. Twice.

"On the 1600th anniversary of the adoption of the Milan edict of Emperor Constantine (born in Nis) and the 35th anniversary of the liberation of Nis from the Turkish rule, the Bishop of Nis, Dositej, initiated the great celebration that took place in Nis from 28th to 30th of December 1913. The ceremonies were attended by the Regent Alexandar, Prince Pavle, Prime Minister Nikola Pasic, the Metropolitan of Serbia Dimitrije, bishops, clergy and numerous citizens of Nis. Among the foreign guests were Russian royal emissary Nikolay Hartwig, envoys of the Serbian allies in the II Balkan War, from Romania, Greece and Bulgaria, as well as representatives of the Russian Orthodox Church led by Anastasie, the bishop of Jamburg and the rector of the Petrograd Spiritual Academy. The film follows the arrival of Regent Alexandar and Prince Pavle at the Nis Railway Station, and a solemn procession that was formed in front of the Nis Cathedral, after a formal service in honor of the Milan edict. Procession, in which priests, high officials and many citizens were present, headed down to the main streets of Nis to the newly built monument to the priests hanged by the Turks in 1821, and the monument was consecrated by the bishop of Jamburg Anastasie. On the last day of the celebration, on December 30th, the guests visited the old church in Nis , the church of Saint Panteleimon , and then they went to the artillery quarters where they attended the review of the haubic units.

"This documentary is a compillation of all parts of our series on the career of a roman legionary. This begins with a review of how one joined the Roman army in the first place, including requirements and inspections. We then join a Roman legionary to see what legionary training was like in a Roman army boot camp. We next trace the progress of pay and promotion over the course of a soldier’s career. This includes a huge number of awards and medals. And finally we conclude with the retirement of a Roman soldier.

"Totally irrelevant to my point. 

The historical claim was that the population grew too large for the island, they destroyed all their natural resources, and suffered a massive population collapse as a direct result **before being discovered by Europeans.**

There’s no doubt that that the slave trade impacted them, but that’s totally irrelevant to the point. 

These were people of Polynesian descent who also apparently reached the western coast of South America around the 14th century (plus or minus a hundred years or so) themselves via exploration. 

In addition to the article I linked above regarding the genetics involved, they’ve also recently released geologic surveying which undermine the ecocide theory. 

Again, I’m not debating whether a good chunk of the population was enslaved at some point but that isn’t relevant at all to the issue of ecological collapse since the slavery abductions didn’t happen until the Dutch started kidnapping people in the 19th century and the alleged ecological collapse happened *before* the Dutch discovered the island.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3Frbml1b2dUZnpjdEJ2ZmQ2SG91V19URFptUkdyV0FnX1dNUE56d0tra0x5U0xSel9xMnpqSk9rMjNOcFhuZHRQbjR5V0pwNllVd0NWLVAzZ3ZwX01yM3c9PQ==

"She wasn’t doing any work on Jimmy Savile! This is an Internet rumour that continues without any facts whatsoever to back it up.

You only have to watch the Netflix series Jimmy Saville to see that there were journalists that were trying to take him to court, but the people who came forward about the abuse they suffered at his hands were too frightened to give evidence and that nothing happened to these people or the journalists…This is nothing to do with why Dando was killed.

"Saw that recently - super interesting! I've always thought the concept of Rapa Nui-induced ecocide was dubious. I do believe though, that the population numbers suffered greatly during those periods pre-arrival of the Europeans.

There are first hand accounts from the likes of James Cook that suggest a small, suffering society. That alongside the folklore you hear on the island, the very little documented information and the obvious loss of faith in Mana and their spiritual beliefs leads me to believe that the population did significantly decrease during a time of hardship but \\*\\*not\\*\\* by means of ecocide.

"Blaming Democrats for “increasing fear” when Trump and his MAGA stooges have spent the last four years screaming hysteria about America being destroyed in all caps on his blog, defending the January 6 domestic terrorists, and inciting multiple terrorist attacks and assassination attempts against their political enemies - is some bad faith trolling.

It was MAGAs who Trump incited to place pipe bombs at the headquarters of the DNC and RNC on January 5 to stop the certification of Biden.

It was MAGAs who Trump incited to go hang his Vice President, and who bashed the skull of Nancy Pelosi’s husband while hunting for her. 

Trump never apologized for what he did to Pence, and he recently joked about the attack on Paul Pelosi, after initially spreading lies and conspiracy theories accusing the terrorist of being his lover.

It was MAGAs who Trump incited to attack FBI offices.

Everything Trump and MAGAs accuse “the left” of always turns out to be projection or confession. 

[Project 2025 was written by over 140 staffers who worked for Trump.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html)

"Yeah, I found [this article](https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/us-news/2021/10/02/zoe-daniel-us-australia-crazy) from Zoe Daniel (before she became an MP) fascinating - especially as someone who doesn't tend to pay *too* much attention to what's going on in America. She talks about the cultural differences between us and the US in terms of how we dealt with COVID, and how Australia's priority of safeguarding the community as a whole made Australia look like some authoritarian hellhole to conservative Americans ([and apparently the fairly liberal NYT](https://archive.is/BdN0N)) because American society is *way* more fixated on maintaining ""freedom"" at an individual level even if that means society as a whole suffers, whereas Australian society has *generally* been more about what's good for the community as a whole.

"The vaccine that Trump takes credit for creating that was rolled out during his administration and he asked his followers to take at his Rally's? How does that have anything to do with liberals? You know the country locked down under Trump during covid right? The Hunter Biden laptop, what of it? Nothing came from that and it's never even been proven to be his why are you acting like it's some gotcha? The Mueller report did not prove Trump didn't benefit from Russian collision like you seem to think it did.   

""Mueller spent almost 200 pages describing “numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign.” He found that “a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.” He also found that “a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations” against the Clinton campaign and then released stolen documents.

While Mueller was unable to establish a conspiracy between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians involved in this activity, he made it clear that “[a] statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there was no evidence of those facts.” In fact, Mueller also wrote that the “investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”

If the election was stolen why did every study and lawsuit prove otherwise? And dems and repubs looked into them with even Trump appointed judges ruling over them so you can't just claim liberal corruption. 

Eight well-known Republican attorneys, judges and politicians say they want conservatives in particular to know the 2020 election wasn’t stolen — former President Donald Trump lost.

They’ve published a report called “Lost, Not Stolen,” which re-examines the lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters calling for election results to be overturned in six tightly contested battleground states: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin.
The ‘Lost, Not Stolen’ report says Trump’s failed legal challenges should inspire more trust in our election security.

David Hoppe contributed to the report. He served as former chief of staff to two Republican Congressional Majority Leaders and has decades of legal experience in D.C.

“I’m certainly not a ‘Never-Trumper.’ I voted for Donald Trump twice for President… if the evidence had said there was something wrong with this election and it was stolen, we would have said that,” Hoppe said. “We looked through the evidence and it didn’t add up. It was woefully deficient, as a matter of fact.”

Hoppe said conservatives should prioritize stopping the spread of Trump’s election-fraud lies over partisan politics, calling the security of our elections, “absolutely critical to both people wanting to vote and to having fair elections.”

Former President Donald Trump claims millions of illegal votes cost him the 2020 election. However, all but three of his 64 election challenges failed.

Trump’s lawsuits included claims of voter fraud, illegal polling procedures, and errors with ballots and voting machines that would invalidate the 2020 election results.

He pulled out of 14 cases; 47 were dismissed by federal judges, including Democratic and Republican appointees. Of those, at least eight were appointed by Trump.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNna1Yta3VZWVR2ZWVzZThZbkZZc2J3Y0daS2tzWm41V3g5aVYzZjFFT3pBU3FwT0ZpYVY5c3U2VldOeXcySXA4UXNyWTlFTUF3MEF0MnoyQk55dkh2OWc9PQ==

"I am generally very forgiving of utilitarian designs in construction and I'm endlessly annoyed by people moaning about the lack of ornamentation on modern day buildings. I'm especially irritated by people claiming these things constitute some sort of secret plot against against traditional aesthetics. However, I do think detachment from popular appeal is a significant problem in the field. Architecture is more ""public"" than any other art style, so I feel it should also be more populist than other art styles, much more in line with general aesthetic preferences.

One party consistently votes for policies and programs that benefit regular working people, while the other party votes to strip those programs to give billionaires more tax cuts and to take our rights away.

More than a million people on Instagram followed her extraordinary career trajectory from extreme poverty in Brazil, to a European modelling career and a life of luxury in the US.   
 
But behind the perfectly curated posts is a story of witchcraft, exploitation and human trafficking - a dark and secretive sorority that led to missing women and sent their families and the FBI on a desperate search to find them.
 
After months of investigations, a team from BBCEye and BBCNewsBrazil uncover a wellness empire built on half-truths and lies. This film tells the story of her enslaved followers and the heavy price they paid. And for the first time - in a surreal confrontation behind the walls of a Brazilian prison - we hear from the self-proclaimed “guru” who exerted absolute control.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSlpxN0xuVWgyQVh6dFI2WXBCTWRHN0syMGlzeXZHTkp1bDVPSndhVjA5UDJ5NGV3SEdmVU4xNXVpTjBEQ1FHYzV5NkgtdGItOE9BcDl0UXZ2c25VWGc9PQ==

"Depends on what you mean. It's a real plan, a lot of people who created it were involved in his administration, and he's familiar with the Heritage Foundation and was aware that they were coming up with a plan for the next Republican administration. A lot of the goals match his, some aren't part of his platform but are up his alley, and others are at odds with his own plans. And the Heritage Foundation is doing some work screening people who fit their ideology and trying to get them put in various positions. All that is happening.

But Trump himself didn't write the plan and certainly hasn't read the plan. He not the mastermind behind it, he's just the candidate that most fits with their plan, and some of it was tailored to him.

You do realize that even [anti immigration groups](https://www.fairus.org/issue/how-many-illegal-aliens-are-united-states-2023-update) estimate less than 20M here in total! And check out the ramp up when Trump got into office and before covid.

A bugatti? come on man...every single fact checker out there is calling this Russian disinformation. stop falling for it! We send them weapons and equipment, not a blank check to buy a car. This is embarrassing stuff to believe. You think Ukraine is fighting them off with nothing, just wasting any aid money on cars yet fighting Russia back??

I love how you mention anything about Biden and his daughter when your guy is well documented to say the creepiest things about his daughter. You guys even called him a pedo for kissing his grandson on his head at his own dad's funeral. grow up already

And if Biden didn't sell reserves and prices went up you'd be here yelling about that. Maybe if you don't want presidents to sell our reserves you shouldn't vote for one that mandated that [we had to sell 100M barrels by 2027](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35032)

"And tell me how did the Democratic Party react when they discovered a corrupt politician in their own party? 

Did all of the Democratic Senators call it a hoax and a witch hunt? 

Did Biden force Merrick Garland to shut down the investigation? 

Did the Democrats in Congress threaten to defund the DoJ and FBI? 

Nope! They stood back and let the FBI and the Justice System do their jobs without interference. Robert Menendez was investigated, the facts and evidence were uncovered, and then he was prosecuted, given a trial, and convicted.

That's how the justice system is supposed to work to remove corrupt people and criminals from the political system.

Contrast that with the Republican Party's relentless attacks on the justice system, ignoring of subpoenas, obstructing investigations, destroying evidence, abusing Presidential immunity and pardon powers, and abusing Congressional oversight to harass the DoJ.

Trump is on tape telling the Georgia secretary of state to ""find me the votes I need to win"". He stole national security documents. He was best friends and neighbors with Epstein and Maxwell for 15 years, then as soon as he gets elected President he has his DoJ arrest both of them, and has Epstein ""suicided"" in a federal prison. He abused the Presidential powers to pardon his inner circle of criminals (Bannon, Stone, Manafort, Flynn). His son in law Jared Kushner got a $2 billion payday from the Saudis. He tried to have his own Vice President hanged for not stealing the election for him. His new Vice President says he's literally America's Hitler.

"This is an appeal to authority fallacy. You should try to defer to authority on say, the position of the sun, the earth's shape, quantum physics, and mathematics. So on and so forth. 

But when you're talking about the arts, you're not going to find some objective paragon of understanding. You will find someone who can attempt to make rather bold claims about why Picasso and Monet pale in comparison to Van Eyck but at a certain point you have to make a personal decision. That is one understanding of art. It is making meaning within yourself based off the creative input of others. And if you think Monet is more beautiful then you do. 

No amount of philosophizing is going to change your mind unless you decide to. That is the crux of the issue with this argument. In my time in academia, I've read some rather bold and illuminating things. I've also read some pure brain rot from people claiming to specialize in their fields. Just look at Shakespeare criticism for that. You will see some seemingly smart people purport complete and utter nonsense with confirmation bias.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpWE84N1lvVi1IRFNfNmJMUlFob3BXOTBkOEFReEdwaU5WbXlRYl9tQ0pmSkJtc2JvR0txSk12ZGNTZ3UxeThLR1BXTVdJYXZ3TTZ4dVJYVDE1REZ1TnNJcUNCRjQwVWV6MExzNHN2enVvNlE9
"Because the argument is always this doomer mentality that we used to have great music, movies, books, art, so on and so forth but then it all came crashing down! It is no more! The end of art arrived the moment rich guys could not paint photo realism for kings! 

Yet at the heart of this is usually people that stopped genuinely searching for art they love years prior. There are genuine discussions to be had about the state of music, film, books, and all forms of media. IP cinema being too overdone is definitely a cinema conversation. But does that really mean there are no good movies? The top 40 hits may be too homogenous, but does that mean there's no good music? 

The problem is one of self discovery. In a world saturated with art, too many people choose the pessimistic view. 'There's too much and the thing I like isn't here!' Well then go on that journey and find it my friend. Find that guy still doing old jazz and the painter still doing Renaissance realism. It is surely out there. 

And we tend to forget that art is about sparking our creative drive to try and make meaning. It is a collaborative effort with your experiences. So you may hate the garage band guys that sound too much like Led Zeppelin or something. Again though, I promise you that you can find good music while other people explore their artistry. 

All you are seeing is a world with so much hope for artists and instead of embracing this world you crave the remnants of one already passed. Do you have any idea how many terrible artists probably existed in the 1600's? You can still read plays that are frankly quite terrible but somehow survived. 

Hell, even the 80's wasn't all bangers, hits, and the best movies ever made. You ever watch Shanghai Surprise? 

Our tendency to create golden ages stops us from appreciating what we have. We are the apex of history where we can access the golden era of every generation before us and still embrace our own. You just gotta start. Go find great art. Internalize it. Make it sing within the song of yourself.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpX01BRGlpN3pQODlIUjlVOGxzdUJuTkFRUkJxMGdyM2ZUQkNBb0lXQUY5dGRVTXhRT3EyUkhObFFlOVRCa3FxemlFWUdsRXpsWnhscnIwejZUNG1IOGlkMk9TellGX3FlNllDTk1mbTF3RG89

The “Mandate for Leadership” is a set of policy proposals authored by the Heritage Foundation, an influential ultra conservative think tank. Project 2025 is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President unilateral powers, strip civil rights, worker protections, climate regulation, add religion into policy, outlaw “porn” and much more. The MFL has been around since 1980, Reagan implemented 60% of its recommendations, Trump 64% - proof. 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge he’ll likely get past 2/3rd’s adoption.

The Heritage Foundation already writes bills for Republicans to submit. That’s how there have been over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills submitted to states since January 1st, 2024. They’re the ones writing these bills and getting the GOP to pass them. They were also the ones who wrote Texas’s pornography ID law that was passed. They have been behind abortion, contraception, and anti-drug laws, too. And Harrison Butker? They were the ones who sponsored him up on stage as Butker works with them frequently. And let’s not also forget that The Heritage Foundation has frequent confrences that showers GOP politicians with lavish gifts while teaching them how to create right-wing propaganda and craft bills against LGBTQ+ people, abortion, and everything else.

There is no “might”. It will happen. The Heritage Foundation controls the GOP.

There’s always a right-winger trying to make people think Project 2025 is no big deal. No, it’s not just a think tank, it’s The Heritage Foundation. They have massive influence over right-wing politicians. Ronald Reagan took direction from them, and Donald Trump let them pick his administration. Betsy DeVos, Mick Mulvaney, Rick Perry, Scott Pruitt, and Jeff Sessions were some of the people they picked.

Back in 2022, The Heritage Foundation completely reversed its position on helping Ukraine. Most Republicans followed suit. They have a lot of power and a lot of Republicans licking their boots. It’s definitely something to worry about.

"There is no 'but', they're two sides of the same coin, one sells the idea that the other is 'literal fascists', the other that they are 'self hating baby killers, etc'.

This is useful to them, your fear and outrage is a product they manufacture to control you, and maintain political control. It's reduced to a stupid contest between sporting teams, complete with team colors, mascots, pre game extravaganzas, half time shows and cheerleaders. And it's all dressed up to be about you totally fighting fascists or whatever. It's stupid and it gets people killed, and it's stupid that you play along - your team has no moral high ground, it is not righteous, you are not moral for waving their flag, and your vote (if you're even old enough to vote) is not 'saving America'.

"I think saying 99% is very optimistic. If a third party gets enough of a % then they’re only going to be viewed as a spoiler regardless of who won. The other side will view them as a spoiler. 

Rfk is not a good representation of a third party. You may like and agree with him but to most Americans he’s a bit crazy. If third party candidates want to do away with FPTP and get representation then they need to work from the ground up.  Why should I vote for some party that has little to no representation in government. 

Some of these third parties have no positions or maybe a handful of local government positions in the entire country. Then every four years they come around and want to be elected to the highest position without doing the groundwork first. 

If you want to do away with the two party system you need to find and vote for third parties from the ground up. Not for president.

"Antifa, although inspired by the term 'anti-fascist,' in its political usage is not a synonym to it. Originally, in the inter-war period, it was a group formed by the German communist party - officially called Antifascist Action. More importantly, at the time, the term 'fascist' for Marxist-Leninists included all capitalist countries and their political parties, not just far-right groups, like the Fascist party in Italy, or Germany's own Nazis. In fact, even the German Social-democratic party was considered 'fascist' by the communists - the term social-fascist was used specifically for them and other social-democratic parties, which by the way in the era were still Marxist, albeit trying to operate within the liberal democratic framework.

Nevertheless, the original Antifa organization became defunct when the Nazi came to power and managed to establish their dictatorship. Post-war Antifa are a combination of far-left, or hard-left if you want to use a euphemism, groups, some of them militant, who use the symbols of the original Antifa organization of the inter-war German communist party, but have no direct connection to it. Antifa today is mostly seen as a movement of various far-left groups (including both communists and anarchists), who have little, if any, direct connection or cooperation between different countries - even regions within states.

"You're actually describing tactics used by anti-fascist groups! ""Antifa"" isn't just fighting white supremacists in the streets, and, imo, violence is unproductive in all but the most extreme circumstances. Clashing with brownshirts doesn't counter root drivers of fascist organizing, and it tends towards the exclusion of women in the anti-fascist movement. 

The social ostracization techniques you describe are much more common. Normal people don't want to live near a fascist, and they don't want to work with one. Leftists [identify and doxx people with violent alt-right views](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/doxing-far-right-violent-extremists/2021/06/20/35f730e2-ba68-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html) to impose social and financial punishments on them, which also threatens closeted-fascists to renounce those views. Anti-fascists damage the property of people and businesses who platform alt-right figureheads and influencers make it unprofitable to provide infrastructural support for fascists. Even mainstream civil action against fascists, like the defamation lawsuit of Alex Jones, could be considered part of ""antifa"" thought. 

These are all very round-about ways of countering fascist organizing and suppressing fascist thought, though. Again, the ultimate goal is to destroy fascism at the root. Allowing fascist speech to flow freely through the discourse is the first false step towards allowing fascists to propagandize, indoctrinate, and grow a support base of followers who'd otherwise hold acceptable moderately conservative views. Rather than leaving the job of crushing the alt-right to a disparate, disorganized collective of weakly linked anti-fascist groups, it would be more effective to adapt the Free Speech Right to accommodate an exception, and bring the full force of the legal system to eliminate any nascent fascist movements.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqRk9JMzlEOFpHNEE1Z2YxU1p4WEV4SlFQdVBqUFBTdXhrb29Fb2E2dGpSdXZGeEIwOXV4bG1CNGhTbTNvZmlLeVdyTVZGN1hxSVh1cmVOa3h2dmM4c3c9PQ==

"I agree with you generally, and I especially agree that violence is unethical, I just don't think giving fascists the freedom to speak publicly is the most effective defense against fascism. 

Before the Internet I might've thought differently, but because information spread is so much faster and so much more decentralized on the Internet compared to traditional media, any propaganda strategy that doesn't use the Internet on some level is doomed to failure. imo it's part of why we're seeing a resurgence of radical ideas breaking into the mainstream.

The silver-lining is that each much easier for a security agency to do surveillance on the Internet compared to in the field, the physical world. I think it's possible to censor ideas such that fascists can't organize over the Internet, and I think it's possible to do that without completely banning historical racist/anti-semitic/sexist texts which still have academic value. 

Part of my own pacifism is believing that people aren't inherently evil, that nasty ideology isn't something they're born with or even necessarily taught by their parents. Sure, upbringing plays a significant role in determining the scope of someone's beliefs, but I think when people embrace a brand of far-right ideology, they first fell into that hole by seeking answers in good faith and being lied to by a propagandist. People should be shielded from such grifters and zealots if possible, both for their own protection, and the protection of those the ideology victimizes.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqbTVkVmRabkRGTjQzM21ZUkI4OGY1OVdpMkV0M19mbDl0Q09ZVkpQUGc4R1o3MWVydWxqRGQ4enBENXdNbHBmUEtNYUpuYklYQndXaFZhZTh4c2FVdGc9PQ==

"This is a solid video, it feels more like a TV documentary of the 90s then a YouTube video. Slower pacing but it's mostly used well - pausing commentary to let the tension sink in before the match was great. The editing around the kick was great too. I loved all of the original footage, plus the solid storytelling makes this a great watch. The map visuals were excellent.

The complexity of the music behind the intro dialogue made it feel too loud. Some of the transitions were a bit jarring, especially in the first half. The timing in general of the first half felt like it could have been smoother. The caption on ""not this city"" footage was hard to read and could have been presented better. A few times, the map felt like it was too much in the background when it had other things overlaying. But those are small things.

"What are you even talking about? First, I am not a conservative, so I don't have to hide behind anything - or whatever you have in your mind. Secondly, if you cannot understand the difference behind the hard or radical left, or whatever euphemism you want to use, their extremist ideology and actions, and actual liberals... then maybe you were not a liberal in the first place.

Also, as I mentioned in another comment, when the original Antifa organization was founded by the German communist party, communists, following the dictates of the Kremlin, considered anyone who was not them 'fascist' including liberals and social-democrats, who at the time were still Marxist, just not of the Leninist variety. I would bet that even most contemporary leftists would have a similar point of view towards liberals and social-democrats who do not kowtow to their dogmatism.

Nevertheless, as far as modern Antifa are concerned, there is nothing different between them and the various far-right and Trumpist hacks who themselves hide behind terms like conservative or patriot. All these militant (or wannabe ones) leftists who claim to be 'anti-fascist' are anything but. They use violence and propaganda to promote their own radical politics, and they are not really any different than the fascists of the opposite political spectrum. They are just opposite sides of the same coin. Cope.

P.s. And by the way, I did not want to mention it in your original comment, this isn't the place for political takes but since you started it, the 'hard left' that you mentioned were also pretty fine with cooperating with fascists and Nazis when they thought it would be to their favour, ask the Polish or anyone from the Baltics if you are interested.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyNUwxazhmdHpYa1FQSGliT0JOQVNuMFZnUGxsblR3dUduOGVVTG1aMUl4MVVuaXVFcDRtMzdSLVhKQ1pfeTVoUi0yRm9YS0FlXzRnZktzM0NwVG9OSXc9PQ==

"Yep. Here's a re-edited, expanded version. I'm not sure it answers your question, but it's the most I've learned so far:

1- Grover Norquist - Taxpayer Protection Pledge (1986) - every Republican signs this civilian document, and ratify it.

2 - Mental hospitals across the country are shuttered, with their contents released to the public at large. At the same time, the opioid epidemic begins, and managed care plans (HMOs) now cover nearly every American worker (c. 1996)

3 - 700 Club, Focus on the Family, Heritage Foundation - installed application kiosks nationwide for data farming and employment manipulation (c. 2006)

4 - Donald Trump is ""erected"" president (c. 2016)

5 - Project 2025 - Heritage Foundation, et al - ??? (c. 2026)

Addendum:

3.5 - Citizens United passes (2010), finalizing TPP.

4.5 - At this time, the language of mental health is downgraded, as Asperger's Syndrome was removed as a medical condition (with an absence of peer review), dissolving the diagnosis into ASD (2013 and 2019). ASD is now a social media trigger, finalizing ""Deinstitutionalization"".

4.5 - All data is passthrough and requires a key. The largest key is money. That money has now been mass-manipulated through alternate, unregulated, pseudo-currencies such as ""Cryptocurrency"" and ""Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)"", finalizing data farming.

4.5 - Donald Trump is assaulted (2024), codifying re-erection opportunity for a convicted felon, finalizing the supplanting of a ""straw man"" in the highest governmental office in the nation.

5.5 - ?",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyX3pZbmxNY2U5Nk5YcUItcldPakphVTVSZ3c2Rm54ZFdhRXJoRmQ0SnhQcWhmQ1pIZ1VvZy1RLTVjLTZRSnFlNWdUdm8ybmNkM2dPTEtKdU1YNTBWVHc9PQ==

"Not necessarily taking a stance on this but all of the US territories are colonies or military outposts with influence so outsized they might as well be. Hawaii surpassed its status as a colony to actually become a state, but there are a hell of a lot of people who would like to see Hawaiians in control of their own islands*.

It could be worse, Puerto Ricans can't vote in federal elections and have no representation in Congress despite Puerto Rico having a larger population than almost 20 of the states (quick google said the population is between CT and UT). 

Remember the ""Thirteen Original Colonies""? ""No taxation without representation""? Puerto Rico is in the same circumstances that led to the American Revolution. Except their overseer is infinitely more powerful and incredibly close by. The only avenues it has to self-governance are becoming a state, which is not likely to happen because it would require a massive power grab by the Democrats -  something only the Republicans have shown the balls / complete disregard for civil society and the rule of law to try - especially if coupled with DC statehood; or some kind of catastrophe that would make the country permanently unprofitable.

The US uses subtler forms of influence than creating a physical colony nowadays, but we are definitely colonizers and it's not unpatriotic to admit as much.

"SOCIAL MEDIA MONSTER, a documentary - 89 minutes Stay Tuned after the credits for some bonus material  
  
https://linktr.ee/socialmediamonster  
  
Watch Social Media Monster, now streaming on Mosaic TV (app available on Roku and FireTV)

SYNOPSIS  
Prepare to pass through the looking glass where one man without a job, living in his car, can leverage a mobile phone and free WiFi at McDonalds & Starbucks to tear apart the fabric of people’s lives. And he can do it all without consequences. Meet Matthew, what some might call a Social Media Monster.    
  
When Matthew arrived in St. Joseph, Missouri, no one had any idea what was coming, that this one man would use social media to disrupt the lives of so many people. This documentary looks at how one person can get away with incredible amounts of damage and never pay a price, even when he threatens to commit acts of terrorism at a nuclear facility.   
  
DEEP DIVE  
What makes Social Media Monster somewhat unique is the “deep dive” elements outside the film. The filmmakers have “brought the receipts” as all the public documents, police reports, emails, Facebook posts, and messages are all available online for anyone to confirm the veracity of the film's claims.

">What are you even talking about? First, I am not a conservative, so I don’t have to hide behind anything - or whatever you have in your mind. 

I’m just pointing out you can say that about any ideology. 

>Secondly, if you cannot understand the difference behind the hard or radical left, or whatever euphemism you want to use, their extremist ideology and actions, and actual liberals... then maybe you were not a liberal in the first place.

I’m definitely not a liberal. I’m a socialist. There is nothing wrong with socialism. 

>Also, as I mentioned in another comment, when the original Antifa organization was founded by the German communist party, communists, following the dictates of the Kremlin, 

You say that like it’s a bad thing. I guess you think it would be better to not resist the Nazis internally than have them be sponsored by communists. 

>considered anyone who was not them ‘fascist’ including liberals and social-democrats, who at the time were still Marxist, just not of the Leninist variety. I would bet that even most contemporary leftists would have a similar point of view towards liberals and social-democrats who do not kowtow to their dogmatism.

So you admit, resistance of the Nazis was led by the hard left. What’s the issue?

>Nevertheless, as far as modern Antifa are concerned, there is nothing different between them and the various far-right and Trumpist hacks who themselves hide behind terms like conservative or patriot. 

This is a Trump talking point. He both sides antifa and the most extreme Trump supporters. “I want to condemn the violence on both sides, both sides.” Why would you do that?

>All these militant (or wannabe ones) leftists who claim to be ‘anti-fascist’ are anything but. They use violence and propaganda to promote their own radical politics, and they are not really any different than the fascists of the opposite political spectrum. They are just opposite sides of the same coin. Cope.

This is also a Trump talking point. This is the kind of shit Joe Rogan says. 

>P.s. And by the way, I did not want to mention it in your original comment, this isn’t the place for political takes but since you started it, the ‘hard left’ that you mentioned were also pretty fine with cooperating with fascists and Nazis when they thought it would be to their favour, ask the Polish or anyone from the Baltics if you are interested.

Ask the US and the UK who refused to ally with the Soviets from the get go. They wanted the Nazis and communists to fight it out because just like you, they figured they’re all the same.

There are multiple geopolitical layers to this.  But they all interconnect. Bear with me. 

Sheryl Sandberg was at Google before she was at Facebook/meta. The common denominator of both was her ad based business model.

https://m.economictimes.com/tech/technology/sheryl-sandbergs-advertising-empire-leaves-a-complicated-legacy/amp_articleshow/91961682.cms

The problem with ad based business models is that if you raise your lens high enough, whomever is buying the most ads is effectively buying their curated version of reality.

When google IPO’ed 24 years ago it shifted from what was most accurate to what was most profitable, all facilitated by a “proprietary” algorithm so nobody gets to see the man behind the curtain.

Now we are 2 very critical decades into what is effectively, a divergent reality.  

The Surkov Leaks:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ukz0G-D5zA&feature=youtu.be

It works…until it doesn’t.

When the richest man, government, or organization on earth is allowed to buy his preferred version of reality it creates some glitches in the matrix.  The 6 million year old source code in your brain knows that conservation is more reasonable than consumption when there are limited resources, but that isn’t very lucrative to someone that needs you to keep buying something that keep them from having to ski with us basic bitches. In this case it’s oil. Russian and Texan owned oil but their paths cross just north of Jerusalem.

Facebook was designed as a direct injection delivery device for Russian/Israeli Psyops and malware. SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Brexit, Palestine, Ukraine, NSO and a handful of other ethically bankrupt dealings are all downstream of Sheryl Sandbergs ad based model. 

Zuckerberg even talked about buying the associated press:

Les Wexner, Miriam and Sheldon Adelson, Sandberg, and Zuckerberg all carried water in conducting the NSO/Pegasus spyware operation INCONUS that was feeding intelligence to both the israeli and by extension, Russian intelligence.  In parallel Epstein was running Kompromat operations in the same circles. There is far more crossover between the Israeli mob/ gov and Russian mob/gov than shows at the surface.

•YLK fund (Abagails father) made up $46.7M of Epsteins money

•Les claimed it was stolen from him but not until after someone asked.

•PROMIS spyware was Robert Maxwells Mossad deal long before his daughter and Epstein started their pedophile thing.

"In 1938 1 out of every 20 people in the USSR was arrested and sent to a gulag under Stalins rule. Mass amnesties during WW2 brought more than a million of those from prison to the front lines against the Germans where they were issued one rifle per 2 soldiers. The soviet system has always had a very different perception of the value of a human life and specifically a disregard for Jewish lives. 

The antisemite Stalins rule did its absolute best to remove any humanity left from the Russian people. They were forced to be brutal simply to survive. The gulags became a crossroads where the best of persecuted humanity and the worst of violent humanity met and fought to the death with highly predictable results. 

https://www.jewishhistory.org/stalin%E2%80%99s-anti-semitism/

Over the next 40 years, the soviet system cleared the gulags a few times.  Because religious leaders often substitute as a defacto government inside of lawless prisons, and because Judaism was one of the predominate religions in Russia and Eastern Europe, the statistical crossover was anyone brutal enough to survive long enough to rule rose to power in the closed gulag eco-system.  A psychopath is more than willing to hide their psychopathy behind legitimate religion or simply kill a man for his hat and identity. 

Psychopathy is broadly defined as the lack of empathy.  Stalins gulags just accelerated refining psychopathy with brutal Darwinian efficiency. 

The newly formed religious state of Israel received a statistically large share of these men from the Soviet Union. There they networked in the internment camps before some stayed and rose to positions of power inside the new community of Israel and some migrated to Europe and Brighton beach in New York. This is a repeating pattern up into the 80’s and 90’s when most of the US based ones rebranded themselves as “Russian oligarchs” because they found it easier to get girls/trap prey that way in America.  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_post-Soviet_aliyah#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20growing%20international,officially%20for%20%22family%20reunification%22.

As the Soviet Union failed and perestroika went into full effect the oligarchy systematically stole everything so effectively that non psychopathic Russians were using bricks as their stable currency. In New York these networks would begin using trump towers and casinos to launder stolen Russian mob money into the U.S.

But now you start to see the nexus of transnational organized crime and money laundering between Russia and the U.S. statistically carries the same 3 passports. United States, Israeli, and Russian.

The reason this is breaking down now is because Russia, whose government was overtaken by the mob decades ago used the same network to interfere with elections around the world that it used for laundering stolen money. 

Facebook was used to encourage Brexit to cut UK support away from Europe because over a decade Ukraines push towards European integration threatened to expose a money laundering operation that Putin has spent almost half a century building. Cambridge analytica/ Nigel Farage and Steve Bannon critically dovetail into that as well.

Epstein specifically targeted Prince Andrew because he was the weak link in the royal chain. That’s KGB Kompromat methodology that was repeated with trump since the days of ray Cohn (his mentor) and the early Russian trump hotel, miss universe pageants, the pee tapes, etc all the way through Lindsay Grahams repressed homosexuality, trips to moscow etc. 

Facebook was also used primarily by Prigozihns Internet Research Agency (I.R.A).  They went so far as to send young newly recruited Russian internet trolls on expenses paid tours around the U.S. so they could more effectively imitate mommy bloggers and 2nd amendment enthusiasts online to sway the 2016 election to the US candidate they had the most control over-  Trump.

Sheldon and Miriam Adelson were tapped by Israeli intelligence (which was being controlled by, or at least feeding intel to Russian intelligence via the multi generational network of russian Jewish families to run an influence operation across the United States political spectrum. 

It’s so much easier to grow a kleptocracy by investment in tech (Yuri Milner/DST, Dmitriev, Brin, etc) than by a ground war but it leaves a very distinct trail when you compare the differentials of the two:

when 40 years of Russian mob money laundering gets outed at the endpoints- (trump and Netanyahu’s respective corruption trials) things start to break down quickly. 

The Russian mob/government planned on stealing the U.S. economy in an American version of perestroika.  I’m not sure it was a grand sinister plan as much as the result of systemic governmental corruption and ridiculous Silicon Valley valuations overlaid on commercial real estate speculation, but the results are the same. Too big to fail does not apply at this level of corruption.  The cancer simply overtakes the host and western democracy, then humanity dies. This closed loop eco-system of cancerous corruption is just a larger scale model of the gulags that preceded it. 

It just required altering the new online reality to keep people oblivious until it was done. It’s effectively the KGB’s soviet era surveillance state, Kompromat, intimidation and mind control from Putin’s formidable years in the KGB cross bred with the video game grand theft auto in the digital age.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNzejNBYkJyZkd1OUtpSGZld0M3NGtSUk5BTExsdjdKRExFeEZsZmFJUkctSElCM19YQnAyd1c0NnVZM04zZHBuWDJZOU04Q3V6N1NJQVowOFRxUXdHdm85TkZuYm5Sa2tnXzF1NThwdHJRb3M9

To quote the late John McCain- “Russian is a gas station run by the mob”. Sometimes the work is for their own mob monopoly, and sometimes they do shady work for hire. 

The CCP needed 2 things to be able to replace the USD with a programmable reserve currency of their own and destroy freedom of press and western democracy forever.  

Grain and  Microprocessors 

Putin promised Xi Ukraine in 3 days during the first week of the Olympics so that Xi would have the grain and supply chain lock (neon) to take Taiwan and TSMC without putting 400M of the poorest Chinese into famine.  

Now, 2 years into a 3 day war Russia desperately needed shahed drones and gave Iran the intel it then gave to Hamas for the Oct 7 attacks. 

The governments of Russia, China and Iran need their kleptocracy to stay dark  for their corrupt business models to survive. 

Trump, Netanyahu and MBS do as well.  The reason it’s all strange bedfellows is because sorting by nationality is their traditional tool to keep all of us fighting so they can hide their grift from the masses. 

Ignore nationality and religion.  Sort by psychopathy and net worth.  The results are exponentially more accurate.

Ukraine and Gaza are both genocides with a primary purpose of obfuscating mob corruption inside these government networks.  

The separation of church and state was a preemptive caution against what is happening right now.  Kleptocracy cares about neither and will use both with abandon to further its insatiable singular goal.

"Democracy is literally one man, one vote. It's the system whereby the public get a choice on who leads them. That's it. There's a whole expanded ideal of what democracy should be, and it's all very nice, and yes that fantasy is dead if it ever even existed at all to start with, but democracy as hollow gesture, lives on.

If your flavor of democracy has more in common with a sporting event, or professional wrestling, than the orderly and civil administration of government business, and the execution of the will of the voting public, then that's real unfortunate, and you should probably treat both 'teams' with equal contempt, particularly when they treat you with at least as much of that same contempt.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0b2VBc1ZBQmxVUF83T0dzMGl1bEI2MktDQ2tNQWdiNWZrT2h2LWNmczlOY0NlSHZBOVA3c3Q3dDdmNFNTM1M1UW1VMFNZeW4xVTBNazFhbVFXcU1ocXl4VFFrLWpsdzVuRmVpYXVVMmZENWs9

It pretty much completes the circle of microprocessors, Ukraine (and a component of why Russia invaded it) and Epsteins connection to mossad who was then feeding the intel to Russia 

Bitcoin+Russian mob+Mariupol plan


Somewhere around 2010 a company called Air Products executed the most aggressive hostile takeover attempt up until that date in corporate history of a company called Airgas.

https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=49808

https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/air-products-faces-modern-form-of-hostile-takeover/

Bill Ackman was a major player in that event.

https://www.chemanager-online.com/en/news/ackmans-pershing-square-unveils-22-billion-stake-air-products

https://www.mcall.com/2017/11/16/billionaire-activist-investor-bill-ackman-cashes-out-of-air-products/

It bounced back and forth for a few rounds until a Delaware court finally knocked it down and the hostile takeover was quashed

A while after that is when air products inked a massive deal in China.

Trump was oddly very into this deal with China and even made a special trip there for it

https://www.chemanager-online.com/en/news/us-firms-benefit-trump-china-trade-visit

https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1D90LY/

But what is really interesting about the timing is that when air products lost the appeal in late 2013 there was a shift in management as the Iranian born Seifi Ghasemi moved from the board to the CEO seat right around the same time that Mike Flynn as head of DIA withheld intel from Obama that let Putin invade Ukraine in 2014 with his “little green men”.

Had air products hostile takeover happened they would have virtually monopolized the neon gas critical for microprocessor lithography in a court or boardroom. “The Mariupol plan”

http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/heather-richardson/betraying-ukraine-trump-reveals-prior-knowledge-putins-mariupol-plan-bragging-hostage-deal/

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/magazine/russiagate-paul-manafort-ukraine-war.html

Ghasemi grew up working for B.O.P and watched through the 90’s as Clinton’s EPA regulations offshored the production of it and donbas Ukraine with the leftover soviet space program infrastructure took up the lions share of the production of it centered around Mariupol.

He also watched its price rise in the early 2000’s as the development of EUV lithography at TSMC made it the long awaited decided upon process after some years of debate and experimentation.

https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/euv-lithography-finally-ready-for-chip-manufacturing-2650276492

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-to-secure-neon-in-Taiwan-after-Ukraine-shock-for-chip-sector

A month after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Xi took his first trip to Amsterdam to secure ASML lithography machines to make microprocessors 

https://youtu.be/RPdEJYwreZg?si=zFRJpAUOuWU6mNDZ

Had Ukrainians given in to the bully in 2014, China and Russia would already control the worlds microprocessors and we would all be begging the king and kissing his ring for our allotment.

GPU’s that mine Bitcoin would demand a kings ransom.

When Aaron Swartz snuck into a closet in the basement of MIT and downloaded a few terabytes of scientific journals and papers, I’m pretty certain he inadvertently downloaded the evidence chain of what Epsteins money was doing at MIT as well.

A lot of people with a lot of world domination and money to lose started getting really nervous and put the DOJ on Aaron like a rabid pitbull until he committed suicide or was murdered due to the stress of it.

Epstein was compromising everyone he could from trump to Prince Andrew to get the Israeli mob (who was then feeding it to the Russian mob) the leverage they needed to seal the deal.

Biden is the president because you crossed your arms and accepted failure over compromise, and *now* you’re willing to accept a Trump victory because Biden isn’t everything you’ve ever wanted.

Biden making backroom deals with Kamala and Mayor Pete is a very basic conspiracy. I think it's more detailed than that but when Bernies supporters see that shenanigans than we're right to think the Democratic party isn't for us. There needs to be another populist movement like Occupy that takes hold no matter the outcome in November. Occupy had broad support and birthed the Bernie movement. This movement should not necessarily be focused on Electoral politics.

*That’s* your corruption? Two candidates during a primary made a deal with each other? In a primary where Biden was already beating Bernie?

Like, don’t get me wrong: I voted for Bernie in *both* of the primaries he was in, but with the progressive vote split between him and Warren, there was just no chance he was going to win the 2020 primaries. There was no conspiracy to get him to lose: progressives just decided they’d rather have neither of them win instead of swallowing their pride and voting for one progressive as a block. They didn’t want a progressive to win: they wanted *their candidate* to win and no one else.

"Boy, listening to people like Chad Wolf or Sebastian Gorka speak is a real reminder of just how completely the GOP has become utterly devoid of intellectuals. After years of purging, it literally is just these flunkies left. Bannon, Navarro, Manafort, Stone, Kid Rock, *et al*. Of all of the parallels made with the rise of the Nazis in Germany, the sheer unconflicted stupidity of the party intelligentsia is among the most persistent.

It may be a bit outside the scope of the film, but one really can’t properly describe the MAGA movement without getting into America’s deeply malignant anti-government movement, which—in its most recent Tea Party iteration—supplied MAGA with its simplistic, racist, extremist, violent ideological foundation. Like everything else in Trump’s life, it was already there and he just parasitized and amplified it. It’s a bit incomplete to say that Trump loyalists *want* a totalitarian regime because they in fact have no coherent theory of government: Just that all government is bad, government is good if it has killing bad guys as its sole duty and justification, and democracy is a weak, artificial disguise of human evil that must eventually succumb to the supremacy of gunfire too.  

Still the film’s conclusion is accurate: The enchantment the “vote from the rooftop” crowd feels for their hero Trump isn’t only a cult of personality, but an expression of a broad, deep, and sincere renunciation of the country’s founding principles.",r/documentaries,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2UE03MzU3SVRNNGtBN2tfX1ROR1ZjVjlhekFTRGhxdmtGZUZuOGVWRWZnZnhVZzdUWHB0VmozclFrWjVfZ211MmZidy0xcjlFRkdQLXo4bzZrVml0Wmc9PQ==

"I recently re-watched Just Brothers, the 30 for 30 doc about Vlade Divac (Serbian) and Drazen Petrovic (Croatian).
