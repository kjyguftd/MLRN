"[14 CFR part 89 ](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-89) is what you want to look at. 

Relevant parts I see are 89.110 a 1. ""From takeoff to shutdown, the standard remote identification unmanned aircraft must broadcast the message elements of ¬ß 89.305."" this does specifically say the aircraft must broadcast the remote id data. 
Similarly, 89.115 a 1 i also says that ""The unmanned aircraft used in the operation must be equipped with a remote identification broadcast module..."" Again saying specifically that the aircraft must be equipped with the module. It's POSSIBLE you could design a unit or app that could comply with remote id requirements, but I don't think the FAA would approve it.

"There's a lot to unpack here. I'll stary off with saying I wouldn't reccomend anything bigger than a 5"" for a beginner pilot. The heavier the quad is, the harder it hits on crashes and the more things it will break.

First off, a 7"" drone is not something I would ever consider flying in a city unless I was on a filming job and had clearance and approval to fly. It's loud and fast. Not something you want around a lot of people. Also no risk of injury with a 7"" is entirely false. You could seriously injure or honestly even kill someone with a 7"" at full speed. A 7"" could easily break through a window if you hit a building also. I hesitate to even fly a 5"" around in a city. 

20-30 minute flight time with a 7"" is also quite unrealistic unless you are using up a ton of your avaliable weight capacity with a massive lithium ion battery pack, and are flying slowly. 

A 10"" is massive quad for any pilot, and especially a beginner. Also I'm not sure where you are seeing 1 hour flight time, but that's pretty unrealistic, again unless you are using up most of your payload with batteries. 

As for controlling with an Arduino, it is possible, but I wouldn't reccomend it. It's probably more worthwhile to get a purpose build flight controller, at least for reliability if not ease of use.",r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZVUliYmpfbmF1TWJ1S2R3MTg5b0lHZDh4MXJHeU83aFpSU29mb2pSTENhSFRQeVZMeVp6MF94bE5ZaVFXdXp0dk5PSjlMLVA4QjVwTlVZS2pnOC1TSUE9PQ==

"""sketchy for me, because it's the only drone of the company and also if you try to find it on internet, it won't find the page or even some pictures of the drone"" Bingo

If you can't find a review of a drone anywhere, it's probably not good. That thing being the ""best"" out of ""26 they've tested"" is the biggest bullshit i have probably ever read. Every drone with that OA camera on top is just some other Chinese knock off that make for 15 bucks.  There is no way some random company comes out and gets ""better picture quality"" than any dji drone. Not unless it costs 5 times the price anyway.

This is a bait and switch scam.  And they get away with it because they are sending them from India, so our laws can't do anything about them.  We really need to crack down on these kinds of ads by barring companies that do things like this.

I am a fan of strong corporate competition and not a fan of specific product bans based on nation of origin, but I AM a fan of banning dishonest companies from the market, as they are bad for the industry in general.

"Best practice for safety right after take-off is to test controls and signal by flying 20 ft high and just go back and forth, maybe loop around for a minute or so in case there is any connectivity issue.

Until you figure out your ranges, fly in wide open spaces if you can, as going beyond large structures, hills etc will effect your signal.

"Hello there, upon checking the video you shared, we noticed that your aircraft has been exposed to water. As for your situation, you may remove the battery and dry it in a cool and ventilated environment. After drying, please do not power the aircraft on. The aircraft contains precision electronic components. When these components are exposed to water, they may react to the electrolytes in the water (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium, and salt), resulting in corrosion and thus affecting its overall performance. If the battery is not swollen or leakage, please send the aircraft with the battery back to DJI for diagnosis. Our relevant team will conduct a thorough check on the aircraft and ensure the flight safety of your aircraft.

"I recently did it and paid $10 for an app called part 107 test and watched a few videos on youtube that were like 2-3 hours long about what you needed to know. Then i noticed the app and the videos were a few yeears old so i researched more about the night flight requirements, flying over people, and remote ID.

"So the strangest thing I have witnessed is what appeared to be one drone coming out of another. That light at the end of clip 8 I can honestly not say. However yes I do see the stay still and even have a consistently illuminated light but that one is usually only white. Also another thing, when I don‚Äôt see them out these days I begin to feel like something is off, so if I scan the sky with my camera I can sometimes catch them hovering stationary just above the tree tops with no lights at all on. What gives them away is they must have some type of thermal protection imaging capabilities that gives of IR light that can only be picked up by a camera. One other thing in the earlier days of this whole drone ‚Äúoutbreak ‚Äú was when I borrowed my friends mavic mini and tried to approach one of them it somehow was able to cut all comms with either the remote or my phone which was attached to the remote. Ultimately it fell straight down and landed in fluffy snow causing very little damage. Fortunately DJI marks the coordinates where it lost signal and even began to save the clip of it plummeting from the sky.

"It most likely starts from the actual ground level of the area/ zone.

However, with airspace restrictions, it is different; for example if you got LAANC authorization to fly 100 feet above ground right next to an airport, the authorization typically specifies that those values are ""absolute"". Here's an example from a recent authorization I received approval for:

Do the drones have any failsafe measures beside landing. I mean something like a parachute or flying with 3 motors?

Is light rain a no go for a show?

Are the dronea certified to fly over people? Are there shows right above people?

How long before the show starts are the drones in the air ?

Do you need any licenses to operate drone shows?

Are you aware of any accidents that happened with drone shows? (any company)

How dense can they fly from the other drones?

"Hey thanks so much! I have family living on Oahu and was recently lucky enough to get to visit! (Hence why there are a few locations on the island).

"Verge's design studio has plugins for Blender, C4D, and Maya. You can export vertex animations with color information from those applications or you can just design the effects directly in the design studio. Inside of the studio, you can see 3D Google Earth tiles to simplify placing animations. The studio runs two loops, a physical constraint loop (velocity/acceleration/jerk limits) and a collision avoidance loop. Ultimately, it attempts to match the imported animations as closely as possible, but while still keeping drones a minimum distance apart and generating a mission that they are physically capable of meeting. Before export, the entire mission is flown in a simulation phase to verify that it is safe. Safety zones are generated based on waiver rules and the show design to make it abundantly clear whether site plans properly contain the show space.",r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTFlWWdNazM1dUc0V3ZIVnZUYndadE45TlBYWGxNd1JkbmR6NEhiOGVjaHpJX3JYVVduQThfZTU4NzVEczQxWXZsZ1pmR3dXM1FUZEdkQkloMU5pZFE9PQ==

"The flight itself is fully automated, but pilots still have quite a few responsibilities.

Temporarily not. If you purchase DJI Care Refresh and your product has not used replacement service during the term of validity, an additional 1-year extended warranty service will be provided for your product. The warranty period of main components is extended to 24 months.""

"Mob6 is great for multigp tiny whoop racing - the hdz eco model will work for you but it‚Äôs considerably heavier than the standard 17.7gr analog version. If you have been flying for many years and you plan to be ultra competitive I believe you want analog. But realistically the extra weight won‚Äôt be what slows you down at first. There are other leagues like ‚Äúunderground‚Äù which requires more weight and eco would shine more there but not super well versed in those.

HDZero are great goggles that are super versatile. I don‚Äôt own them but plan to get a set eventually. I would look into running analog and walksnail with them. The hdz goggles are really big in the racing scene from what I‚Äôve seen.

For 4k60fps you can for sure use DJI O3 (with the right goggles) or strap an action cam on. I believe walksnail has a 4k camera option as well but you‚Äôd have to look into that. 

Smallest 4k drone with a long run time: A good example that comes to mind is an O3 Flywoo LR4 (maybe a walksnail version? Not sure) it‚Äôs a 4‚Äù with 1404s motors that is sub-250 if using most <=660mah 4s batteries and around 380gr with 4s 18650 packs. Flylens 85 O3 is also a solid option with 1000mah 2s packs you can get 5‚Äì7:30 min of flight time from a 2‚Äù prop cinewhoop that‚Äôs super light weight and flies nicely even with some wind. Those are just what comes to mind and ones I own. I‚Äôm sure there are other options out there. 

I‚Äôm still waiting for my Flik to ship but I plan to use an O3 with it. 

If you‚Äôre thinking of getting into racing I‚Äôd also get velocidrone to practice on in addition to liftoff. Also, id recommend an elrs rsdio, not sure on the zorro but the radiometer boxer has been pretty solid for me.",r/drones,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaeXYwX0lpMS1PeXY1REE2eUJjRko4R0hwdXh1SHAtTXRkTW9EUXBEZUFPN2E4S2JZWUxfRWZZYnhnQkNrVDg0QXIyLW1fRFhJTFB4X1VUbFBCR0sxd3c9PQ==

">one drone coming out of another.

Doesn't sound like a drone.

>they must have some type of thermal protection imaging capabilities that gives of IR light that can only be picked up by a camera.

NOR does that. ü§î

>was able to cut all comms with either the remote or my phone which was attached to the remote. Ultimately it fell straight down

Is that normal behavior for a drone? Just falling out of the sky if it loses the signal from the remote? I've never had one, so I don't know that much about how they operate... But that sounds like a pretty massive design flaw if that's the case. And a serious safety risk... Sounds like it was downed intentionally. 

TBH with you, I don't think everything you're seeing is a drone. Some could be for sure... But some of that IS kind of strange... Sounds like UAP/UFO behavior. Especially the light only being picked up on camera.

They're actually more common than you think. A misconception a lot of people seem to have is that they'd automatically recognize one if they ever saw one. A lot of people have had sightings without realizing it...

Here's a couple examples. Worth reading through the comments, the people that posted them provided more detail. Neither one seems to suspect what they saw was out of the ordinary.
