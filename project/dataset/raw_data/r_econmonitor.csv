">VI. Wasn’t Bitcoin Supposed to Solve This?  
I am aware of the grand claims made by proponents of these and similar products. They are disintermediating the financial system. Banking the unbanked. Enhancing freedom. Changing the world. And when I read the whitepapers, it can be hard not to buy in. Many of the goals of the crypto ecosystem are goals I support. How can you be against freedom and prosperity? But when I look at products like the ones at issue in today’s approval, I have a simple question: wasn’t bitcoin supposed to solve this? If the technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?\\[42\\]  
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system.\\[43\\] Individual investors in the U.S. who want to invest in the product may already do so, either by mining it themselves or by setting up a wallet and buying it from someone else, each of which they are able to do from the comfort of their living room. That is the whole point of creating a new, censorship-resistant digital currency. So why is so much energy being expended on linking it to the existing financial system? I fear that our actions today are not providing investors access to new investments, but instead providing the investments themselves access to new investors in order to prop up their price. While this is in the interests of the sponsors of the ETPs, as well as the law firms and service providers who will get paid by them, my duty is to consider investors, markets, and the public, whose overall interests I do not believe are in fact well-served today.  
\\* \\* \\*  
I am deeply concerned about today’s actions. I am concerned that these products will flood the markets and land squarely in the retirement accounts of U.S. households who can least afford to lose their savings to the fraud and manipulation that appears prevalent in the spot bitcoin markets and will impact the ETPs. I am concerned that today’s actions will create the imprimatur of Commission approval and oversight of the underlying spot markets when really no such oversight exists. I am concerned that there will be confusion about what exactly these products are – (they are not ETFs registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the ubiquitous products that today are used by millions saving for retirement) – and that investors may infer protections that do not in fact exist.\\[44\\] I am concerned about what comes next – when new, potentially more speculative products bearing greater risks of investor harm seek to list, we will hear a chorus of well-heeled voices saying that the SEC’s hands are tied by the new standards that we have set. I fear that today we are setting ourselves up for tomorrow’s failure, and it will be the investors that we have a duty to protect who will ultimately pay the price.\\[45\\]",r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTbGxjR09GNmlXZXhQSERvcjRCWVZaZmVvWnlESGVjQW1zM0RQNlpFN0RSSTAtdGVETlRSUjg5QkItUHZ0MkZDOVpodWIzUE1EZGs1VF9RVWxHTUhCa0E9PQ==

1. Who says there have been no repercussions? Are you confident that none of the recessions or economic issues that residents of the United States have faced are partially due to national debt?

"I hope you'll forgive a question about something basic:

In the recent Fed statement, they said they're keeping interest rates the same while continuing to sell assets (quantitive tightening).

How do they do both at the same time?",r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSW1RUkp1dXNLYV9NQ1E2dzZoelVFZ3hvNnYzTjRsMHd0VDZaZnFhYnNENFc5M2RvS2dTRWZaMFZYeExNZ0lINEVvbldSWlhhSjdSdzhocUhRek1SNnc9PQ==
"u/skybrian2 good question. Here's [some reading material on the subject](https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/the-fed-implements-monetary-policy#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20the%20Fed%20adjusts,to%20serve%20as%20a%20ceiling) from the St. Louis Fed.

The part you're probably looking for is the following...

>To provide support, the Fed offers the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility to a broader set of large financial institutions: They can earn the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offering rate, or ON RRP rate, by depositing funds with the Fed at this facility. So, this second administered rate helps set a floor for the federal funds rate.

and

>The discount rate is the interest rate charged by the Fed for loans it makes through the Fed’s discount window. Because banks will not likely borrow at a higher rate than they can borrow from the Fed, the discount rate acts as a ceiling for the federal funds rate.

and

>In short, the Fed adjusts two administered rates, interest on reserve balances and ON RRP, to keep the federal funds rate within the target range determined by the FOMC. And the Fed adjusts the discount rate to serve as a ceiling. The Fed usually adjusts the three administered rates (interest on reserve balances, ON RRP and discount) by the same amount and at the same time so they move up and down together.

The simple answer is that the Fed uses open market operations as *supplementary* to these other policy tools as a comprehensive set to keep the Federal Funds Rate within the upper and lower bounds. Because it's not the only tool being utilized to maintain the upper and lower bounds, they can conduct open market operations without negatively impacting adherence to the target range. The extent by which the Fed can do this is limited by available *slack* in the market i.e. if reserves are tight and cash is expensive in the open market, if the fed were to conduct large scale asset sales during such an environment they could hypothetically risk pushing the rate out of their target range temporarily as you elude to.

The more complicated answer involves discussion of yield curve control, FOMC communication to set expectations in the market, and the types of assets being exchanged.

"Thanks! That makes sense.

I suppose it's also true that the Fed can offer financial assets for sale at any price they like, and they can offer to pay interest on reserves at any interest rate they like.

Seen in this way, reserves are one of many financial assets that the Fed has for sale, and they need to choose their relative prices in some rational way. If they want certain assets to sell, it would make sense to offer them at a slightly higher interest rate (lower price) than reserves.

If there isn't much demand at current prices, the assets won't sell, but they don't need to hurry. Maybe that's another way of talking about ""slack in the market.""",r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTa3RSamY1V1FrbzdrYlVmbl92QzVFQXUtQ21TM2NSMHFFY0piQjlwVGtSbzVGTnhnekl2VWZRUUxHOGJKaW1kUWs2cnRtZ2UwZ3RGZzlqTEFBMVg2LVE9PQ==

"Commentary in general is always going to be self-serving to some extent. 

I do agree that the motivation from a for-profit organization is going to be editorialized to fit the business. But there is still motivation for the commentary to be reasonably accurate.  There will also be differences between commentary from a buy-side asset manager like Blackrock vs sell-side firms vs investment banks vs commercial banks. 

And even among asset managers - the quality of the commentary will vary greatly. Commentary from an asset manager like Blackrock will vary from commentary from an asset manager like ARK Investments.  And different asset managers look at macro indicators through different lenses  - an asset manager like PIMCO which focuses primarily on the debt capital markets will be different than one that focuses on equity markets. 

I have also seen some really bad commentary and research from non-profits.  Someone recently posted a research paper in another subreddit from an economics professor (University of  Florida - iirc - paper about fund expenses and impact on retail investors) But the paper was so bad and appeared to be written without consideration to how market microstructure works and excluded some very important facts.  It seemed like the professor didn't actually have any real-world experience. 

And with for-profit organizations like bank holding companies - commentary (especially market commentary) from different subsidiaries within the holding company may sometimes even disagree with each other. 

I think the key is to understand the source, potential motivation, experience, and access to data of any commentary.",r/econmonitor,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTc3Rtd1VlYUs2QXZGbE56Z3gteHotZ3BFNk9BWUFqYWt4UGNFVTR4Tjc3dWYwYXQ3Q004ZFRkUWZYMVFCNnB2YmdOWkFlNFJZTHd5Wnl2WlhuZDhWUHc9PQ==

"Interesting take-away. The goals are lofty and will be hard to hit, and the home-building industry may get a boost. 

>Bottom Line
The federal government’s housing plan is highly ambitious and should deliver at least some boost to housing supply, particularly in the purpose-built rental space. However, capacity constraints in the construction sector will limit the government’s ability to reach its lofty target for new homes. The coming years should provide an important litmus test for how well policies geared towards purpose-built housing can support rental construction. This is because population growth is expected to be much slower due to the federal government’s plan to lower non-permanent resident levels.
