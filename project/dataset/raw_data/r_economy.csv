"> You don't need another year of record-breaking profits. 

But they do. It is literally how American corporate executives and Wall Street function. They focus on short-term gains to maximize their bonus structure because Wall Street is obsessed about growth. They don't care. This is not sustainable long-term because when they signed up for the job they negotiated golden parachutes. So when they eventually leave or get fired or replaced, they still collect a huge amount of cash on exit and they're not the ones to clean up the mess. There's no penalty for fucking things up.

Getting rid of all social safety nets has been the ""Freedom Caucus's"" wet dream for years.  Before that it was the plan of the Heritage Foundation, The Cato Institute, Judicial Watch, American's for Progress etc etc.  Project 2025 is their baby.  These genesis of all of this was Fred Koch Sr. who worked for Stalin.  When he came home he approached William F Buckley to incorporate his ideas into the GOP. Buckley rejected him saying his ideas were too radical (fascist) and the John Birch society was founded.

In 1973 the Heritage Foundation was started and the rest is history. They now have over 100 organizations and their allies include almost every billionaire in the USA.  The Koch's have directly shaped over 1000 elections. They are the closet thing to ""king makers"" in contemporary history.

"Corresponding rent cap. Squeeze them out of business.

You don't have to like this, but in 2018 and 2022 the San Jose Mercury News ran articles both years on these issues.

2018 (or 2017) they detailed how there were 5-8 vacant homes per homeless person across each city in the SF Bay Area. No one cared to read or listen.

You could have given EVERY homeless person in the Bay Area a home and still had a 4-7 home surplus.

2022 rolled around and they more or less wrote, ""hey guys, nothing really changed.""

So, I, for one, have zero sympathy for property owners getting squeezed to death. Until everyone is housed, there should be no extra properties for investment, pool house, whatever.

Moreover, plenty of those surplus houses end up being vacant.

"You really need to read Marx to understand where he was coming from. He is still relevant today because his ideas about capital, wages and labor are expressed in many of the same ways that Marx expressed them. He was also a philosopher because one of his main issues with capitalism is that it destroyed the creative process of the masses by separating the laborer from his work, his creation, and reduced his creativity and ingenuity to simply represent his time spent and nothing else. 

This reductionism was simply a way to remove the value added by the laborer and shift it to the capitalist. 

Adam Smith and Karl Marx agreed on the labor theory of value and Smith wrote about the need for vigilance in managing capitalists or they would steal all of the value provided by labor. 

Smith also wrote about the conflicts of capitalism and the possibility of capitalism cannibalizing itself, which it is  currently in the process of doing.  This dynamic is tautological to capitalism.  Fascism is a natural course of evolution for capitalism and it is where we are today. 

Capitalism has killed more than communism ever will. It has killed millions in the USA alone.  There has never been a communist state, only socialist states run by communists and never communists that followed all of Marx's ideas.  So we have Stalinism, Leninism, Trotskyism and so forth.   

Most of these failed ideas were because you cannot implement communism from the top down, it must organically take shape from the ground up.  No one wants to hear this, but that is the way it is. It is an ideal that requires human beings to re-prioritize wants and needs.   You cannot allow this to happen in a consumer culture.

Capitalism was supported after mercantilism because it is a vehicle to concentrate capital and wealth. The bourgeoisie would not allow any other type of economic system to develop.

"Not odd. Biden took a country an economy in crises and stabilized it. 

Maybe you don't remember 2020. President Trump flailing about like a Chaos Monkey with no plan, and no response for the crises that the Covid pandemic caused. With cargo ships backing up in ports, goods not being shipped to stores, people being laid off, stimulus money that had no over site, because Trump removed the regulatory board, and rampant fraud.

Biden directed the DOJ to investigate and prosecuted the fraud, put together a task force to help get goods moving through our ports again by coordinating between shippers, port authorities, warehouses, longshoremen man and state authorities. He calmed the nation, got the economy moving again, and got money flowing again.

Now if you wanted to criticize Biden on inflation you could criticize him for re-appointing Jerome ""Soft Landing"" Powell to head of the Federal Reserve. Powell slowly ramped up interest rates in order to avoid a recession, instead of massively raising them right away to kill inflation.

"The fed simply follows the market when raising or lowering rates. The 2yr is almost an ideal indicator. You cut too soon, and money could flow out of treasuries into anything else and could be inflationary as well as lowering confidence in the treasury. You raise too much, too much breaks that the government and fed have to bailout. 

“As you can see from this longer-term chart above showing the 2-year treasury yield compared to the Fed funds rate, the 2-year treasury yield was lower than the Fed funds rate in the late 1980s, and was followed by both a recession and lower interest rates. It again happened in the early 2000s and in 2007/2008, all resulting in lower rates and a recession.“

"> Now you want 120 000 for a truck that's going to be worth 80% of that when I drive it off the lot and it won't last 10 years.

Not to pick on electric vehicles, but recently a salesman at Ford just ""had"" to see to it that I went home with the new EV Mustang. It's slick as hell, and MSRP around $62k with all final bells and whistles. However the 11 hour battery charge time is a deal breaker.

Me: I can't drive back to Tampa Bay to visit family. That's an 11 hour drive from here and with 250mile range per charge, it would take me around 38 hours of charging time alone to even get there and then coming back would be another 38 hours.  So that's 76 hours or 3.1 days of vacation extra I'd have to use to even get there and back. 

Ford: But you can charge it for 45 minutes and go 30 miles on it!

Me: And what happens when I'm in rural Georgia or Florida and there's no charging station?

>The fed simply follows the market when raising or lowering rates. The 2yr is almost an ideal indicator. 

This is however more specific -- not simply general. Relating to the 1st paragraph of the article?

>Leadership from the Federal Reserve have echoed the notion that **it needs to take in more economic data before making its next policy decision over interest rates**. WIth the latest US Consumer Price Index data revealing inflation is cooling, the question becomes how much more does the Fed need to make interest rate cuts?
 

Similarly:

>Also on Thursday, Mary Daly, a key Fed official, suggested that the central bank should cut rates soon. Daly, president of the Fed’s San Francisco branch, said she believed that slowing inflation and a cooling job market justify a reduction in interest rates

https://apnews.com/article/inflation-prices-rates-economy-federal-reserve-biden-8d15ca77433a1ae072a1e63dfc089f24

So we've now got ""needs to"" as well as ""should..""

This later articulation from Daly is like most Fed statements couched in a kind of '*Language of the Fed*' - in which it uses words like *justiified* to indicate that it is ""OK with' and maybe possibly could or is more likely to take a possibly corrective action (such as lowering interest rates) when it usually 'simpy follows the market' instead.

“If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.”

Republican policies generally enhance the wealth and influence of private entities. Private entities influence power in governments whether the current admin is D or R.

How powerful a government becomes is directly related to how much control the wealthy want to have. When they feel threatened they finance campaigns and agendas that ensure their influence and desires. 

It’s never about D vs R. Governments are almost always steered towards overt or covert fascism by elites depending on how threatened their status quo becomes.

"Capitalist fascism \\[local home grown\\]

Residents in Atlanta shattered the record for turnout at a city council meeting Monday, \\[6/12/23\\] as thousands lined up to voice their opposition \\[77% were opposed\\] to the construction of a massive police training facility known as Cop City. Ultimately, the Atlanta City Council voted 11-4 to approve $30 million in additional funding for the project, bringing the total to $67 million, more than double the original estimate. 

The contentious vote comes after a SWAT team raided the Atlanta Solidarity Fund last Wednesday and arrested three people who had been raising money to bail out protesters opposed to Cop City, charging them with money laundering and charity fraud.

Forty-two protesters still face charges including domestic terrorism for opposing Cop City, and activists continue to demand answers over the fatal police shooting of environmental activist Manuel “Tortuguita” Terán in January. That is police state fascism. 

Charging people with crimes for simply exercising their const. rights, when absolutely none were, as it was non-violent until the police arrived and they used their monopoly of state violence. This is fascism people. 

America becomes a police state when demonstrators can be arrested and charged with their finance being money laundering and their protests as terrorism. See how easy it is ?

"Capitalism itself doesn’t murder people. Bad people murder people.

Even before capitalism was known as a concept, people fought and died over resources and access to resources.

Even socialism and communism are by nature coercive regimes, because they require violence, punishment, incarceration, torture, and execution for those who refuse to participate or give up their property or the fruit of their labor.

"Who is going to be telling dealers this lol? The manufacturers? Dealers can price things where they want (but it's a HIGHLY competitive market, so they'll charge what ppl will pay without losing sales to the dealer selling the same product down the street). And manufacturers are the ones who upped MSRPs to begin with...but why?... it's easy to just point fingers at the manufacturers or dealers...lotta ppl I see do that like it's solely on them. 
Prices rose on everything. Manufacturers raised prices because cost to make vehicles went up...supply chain interruptions and parts/resource shortages caused parts to cost more. And greed too definitely..but that's not exclusive to the auto industry. 
And people complaining about new and used car prices being due to greed by dealers. Well...the dealers who had their 5k-10k+ markup from MSRP are greedy yes (I recommend buying vehicles from dealers who didn't do this...not all dealers are bad). But they were selling less cars...less new vehicles means less new sales and less trade ins/less used sales...and big dealers have a LOT of personnel on the payroll, so it is understandable to an extent (but really fuckin dumb too cuz that's not a good long term strategy if you want good relationships with customers/repeat business).

And the used car market itself isn't on the dealerships. Used car values went up...yeah it sucked to pay 30% more for a used car but there isn't a used car factory...dealers acquire used cars by taking in trades...and trade ins cost dealers ≈30% more to take in. Same with Auction prices. Dealers don't have much of anything to do with the car market values...like any market there's a ton of variables. 

I always laugh when someone shopping for a used vehicle offers way less than the selling price. A lady today at the dealership I work at offered 26k for a certified used Durango priced at 34k...the Durango has a retail value of 36k and trade value of 32k. Like...where do you think we got this Durango lady...and how much should we be allowed to make selling a car (dealerships aren't charities)?  Someone traded this Durango in...if retail is 36k and trade in value is 32k...do you think the person who traded it accepted like 8 grand less than nada/KBB trade value? 
And what really gets me is the same ppl bitching about high prices expect the MOST $ for their trade in... 'you are only offering me 10k?!?! KBB says it's worth 14k!!'
Let me guess...that's  'excellent condition' trade value on KBB   (even tho KBB says that only 3% of used vehicles meet this criteria and your trade needs tires/brakes/a front bumper/windshield/detail/etc.)

"What on earth are you going in about. Nothing you said even addresses my core statements and instead goes on some rant about the United States. 

The issue with China lies in its very low economic productivity per worker per hour, which stems from its low level of total factor productivity. Simply producing more goods will not resolve this productivity issue, as it is structural in nature. The Lowy Institute provides a detailed overview of the economic challenges facing China and the underlying causes of its low productivity.

Where did I mention healthcare? We're discussing industrial robots. Healthcare is only one component of the United States economy, just as manufacturing is only one segment. The U.S. economy is primarily based on services such as entertainment, music, finance, software, education, gaming, insurance, and cloud computing. If we start using selectively sampled data, let's consider how China has twice the cost of property per square meter despite significantly lower income. I recommend you study economic theory instead of trying to represent smaller parts of an economy as representative of the whole.

People in positions of wealth and power benefit greatly from capitalism but they do not need capitalism to survive or even thrive. 

If every common worker is replaced by AI/ML/automation/machines there will be rich people who lose wealth. Overall though, those who maintain control over the means of production will continue to do just fine regardless of what happens to other people.

There is zero incentive for these people to ensure the health or safety of others, other than the leverage society has over them by virtue of common people being able to derive that power from being needed.

"We might need money to keep flowing through an economy. That does not mean that economies can't fail. ""Who the fuck would buy anything"" is half the point. If every business and corporation were a single, thoughtful entity then this line of thinking would be valid. They are not.

Businesses of all shapes and sizes are strongly incentivised to minimise head count. The greatest expense and challenge for any given business is the employment of people. As individual businesses they will all seek to transfer their gainful work to automation. There are many advantages to automation of various kinds that greatly increase the wealth of the people at the top. Their implementation frequently sees large percentages of a given workforce made redundant, while executives as a direct result give themselves a pay rise and see the stock price rise.

This will break economies and destroy many businesses. A variety of incentives that drive businesses are perverse when examined from a sociological perspective but completely reasonable when considered from a given businesses perspective.

"Not directly, no. But hear me out.

A UBI system can be satisfied through means other than a direct government payout. The US health insurance system has been historically tied to your job. Thus, the outcry over corporations laying people off willy nilly.

The US government doesn't fund electricity, Internet connections, or even computer or smartphone production. The states and cities may help support some of these, but these are each increasingly factored into standards of living. Corporations collectively play a big part in improving our daily lives, and they are often incentivized to further those goals.

Creators are getting either ad revenue, promotion incentives, affiliate revenue, subscriptions, or donations. Most of that money is coming into the creator system through countless companies. Those aren't tax payouts, but they are fueling part of the economy.

The articles are scary because people get scared by being unable to purchase a home despite offering 10s of thousands of dollars over asking price by cash buyers with deep hedge fund pockets, who will then - if they do end up long term renting, charge inflated rent prices because what are people going to do, buy their own home?",r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaWmVhcUJGei14RnAxMF9qeUNyYzVMYVBhblFyaVBHWkE0MGN5dzdnU3pvR0lQY1dvbVFpV0xtSVVuRHRGc1Q1Wm9VaXBYVzdwV2ptaGtPY25kUmJybmc9PQ==

Thanks for explaining your thinking on the second part, but you've got it backward.

UBI increases demand, more is produced, and fixed costs are spread out further = lower prices, not higher. 

Of course, that's a general rule, and your example of college education is a good exception. There's a bunch going on there, including colleges purposely not expanding to meet increased demand (in order to drive up prices, like diamond cartels) and the way loans are borrowed into existence (reducing price constraints).

I wouldn't really call them high birth rate when you look at the [fertility rates](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00550-6/fulltext) and the projections (replacement rate is 2.1).

Regardless, those countries are more effective for sweatshop and agriculture work rather than skilled labour. There's a strong relationship between fertility rate and education, so choosing high fertility rate countries means choosing uneducated workers, which wouldn't work for everything China is currently producing. Africa has a high fertility rate, but you are forgetting that most of these people [never finished high school and some never even went to school](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/developmenttalk/high-price-education-sub-saharan-africa).

"Because we do not have a housing shortage, we have an AFFORDABLE housing shortage. There are currently nearly 15 million unoccupied homes in the US. While many are dilapidated, most are just sitting due to no one wanting to pay the ridiculous amount of rent or price of the home. Landlords refuse to back down on rental prices knowing it is better to wait for the right offer rather than risk losing money in the long run. This number will increase until the bubble finally bursts. Back in 2008 the number rose to 19 million before the collapse and inevitable glut of defaults. Speculators just walk away from the loans and eventually file for bankruptcy. Of course it is not personal bankruptcy since they do this after forming an LLC. So they rake in the money while they can, then just walk away with the profits in the end and wait it out until next housing boom. In the mean time those of us at the bottom have no where to wait it out, until the banks start selling their inventory, and the cycle starts all over again. It is absurd that we allow this here. As to building more houses, this solves the problem because in order to stay in business, contractors would need to build homes that people can afford rather than the mini mansions speculators prefer. Since supply would outpace demand at this point, the market will correct itself. Since we would remove the incentive for speculators to continue the cycle, the prices will stabilize.",r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad2lJNUhodWlIcHpJQ1ZhcFF6TVVOc1JFZG5Hc3h5b1BwUlFic3hEZDVrZGtPU2E1R2pPdEw2bG1QdUp0aTkzOUJpZ0xhaDRfYUZjODBkRi1Ea1RWbWc9PQ==

"Sometimes the Venn diagram of ""highest paying job they can get"" and ""it does pay enough"" is two circles... do you think everyone working multiple jobs does it for fun?

""produces X a year in value"" is subjective, like all value. Wages are how much of the value gets returned to the person producing it... and when there are more people competing for a job then there are jobs available, employers can offer to return less and less of that value until potential employees stop applying. It doesn't change how much ""value"" the position is producing.

My Asian-American expat friends and I, who have lived in Singapore or in the region, often compare and contrast Singapore (and other Asian countries) with the Bay Area since they are closer in size and population.

We believe that Singapore, because of its business laws, tax rates, and location, is a natural hub for multinational corporations to set up regional headquarters. This also attracts international knowledge workers. These reasons are a significant part of Singapore’s high GDP per capita.

Singapore’s schools are ranked number 1 on the PISA test. This is a major factor in their success.

When we look at the Bay Area/Silicon Valley, it is the main headquarters of big tech companies. It also attracts international knowledge workers who eventually become citizens. The population in the Bay Area has a higher GDP per capita than Singapore.

As Asian-Americans, we may have a bias towards believing America is better. If we segment the PISA data, Asian Americans score better on the PISA test than Singapore. Since Asian Americans mostly live in metropolitan, coastal cities, it’s reasonable to say that the Bay Area PISA scores are more likely to be closer to the Asian American scores than the US national average score. https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/s/2eGOrM5WdA

"> We are reaching a point where we just don’t need the amount of human labor that needs to work.

So think about that.  What happens?  Same as always in history, when machines make things faster and with less labor, the cost of the thing they make decreases for society.  If this happens across society, everything gets cheaper, same as it always had.  Before the power loom, the average person could afford one maybe two sets of clothes.  Clothes were kind of heirlooms because they were so expensive.  Today, we literally throw old clothes away because mechanical looms can make so much fabric so quickly.

So when this happens across the economy, the goods and services produced by automation get cheaper for everyone.  Jobs are replaced by that automation, but now that things cost less, new jobs appear that weren't economically feasible before.

Imagine it's 1850 and less than 0.01% of the population can afford to go skiing because they are busy not starving.  Imagine how hard it would be for those people to imagine someone having a career as a ski instructor.  There's no demand for it in 1850, and it's just wildly unfeasible for that to exist.  Today there are literally tens of thousands of ski instructors, at every ski hill everywhere.  It's literally their job, to teach people how to have fun on skis.

So relax, just as ski instructor is financially viable today, new jobs of the future that we can't imagine will appear, and will then be viable, simply because we've automated the production of most goods and services.",r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaSER3Q3huSmx4T0hOV1FJbVp6emhnbmpQYzFtZDcya2tsZXlxU3FRY2hvaXNuam14aGRval9vWjFQZnVqZHd6UG1PNWhXdkp1WDR5ZlVxRUl2SFBMSnNrUlNBRExQWnJoRHdYSHgxb2JwNXc9

"He's proposing CPI + 5%, which is the exact same policy in place in California today. It will literally have zero impact (either positive or negative) on the housing market. A 5% + CPI rent increase is quite high, and there are virtually no places in the US that experience such high rent growth long-term. However, short-term rent growth can exceed CPI + 5% (especially if there's a natural disaster, sudden rise in demand, etc.) and Biden's policy is supposed to limit annual increases so the rent hike can be applied over several years. Of course, this will not do anything to reduce rents, and building housing is the ONLY solution. However, unlike rent control, it won't have any negative impacts on the economy since the cap is so high, and honestly, that's the biggest argument for why this policy shouldn't be implemented: it's a nothing burger. The real issue is that inflation-adjusted rents are slowly but steadily rising throughout the US, and this policy will do nothing to stop that.",r/economy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnc1hNeTVCUUJMSkRiTENneXdVVnlXODNhSjhUdWFXdTYtMFY3ZXloankzVDJZRzEzdnpqUXRIMkViWTRJemNTTnRUcXFlajhBTTYtOXFDamExeVlQMUE9PQ==

"*Thanks for sharing our story from Bloomberg News reporters. Here's some more details:*

China’s twin-track economy is generating doom-and-gloom headlines about domestic woes one moment and growing fears around the world about the dominance of its manufacturers the next.

Those conflicting signals on Monday showed ongoing strength in industrial production more than offset by tepid consumption as the property slump continues, leading to the slowest quarterly growth pace in five quarters. But through the fog a silver lining is becoming clear: Xi Jinping’s long quest for technology-driven “high-quality growth” is actually starting to pay off.

While Japan and America both suffered deep economic setbacks when their housing markets hit the skids, China’s tech advances and resulting export boom have helped to keep economic growth within reach of its targeted pace of around 5%.

And the nation’s leaders are determined to keep it that way.
