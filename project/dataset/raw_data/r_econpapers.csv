"**[Chinese Banking Liquidity Crisis of 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Banking_Liquidity_Crisis_of_2013)** 
 
 >The Chinese Banking Liquidity Crisis of 2013 was a sudden credit crunch affecting China's commercial banks evidenced by a rapid rise on 20 June 2013 in the Shanghai interbank overnight lending rates to a high of 30 percent from its usual rate of less than 3%. The ensuing panic affected gold markets and stock. China's regulation of the foreign exchange market had caused a decline in inflow of cash. On 19 June 2013, instead of injecting additional funds and easing its monetary policy, China's central bank People's Bank of China (PBOC) told commercial banks to ""make full use of incremental funds and revitalize stock options"".

 >The Chinese stock market turbulence began with the popping of the stock market bubble on 12 June 2015 and ended in early February 2016. A third of the value of A-shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange was lost within one month of the event. Major aftershocks occurred around 27 July and 24 August's ""Black Monday"". By 8–9 July 2015, the Shanghai stock market had fallen 30 percent over three weeks as 1,400 companies, or more than half listed, filed for a trading halt in an attempt to prevent further losses.
 
**[COVID-19 recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession)** 
 
 >The COVID-19 recession is a global economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The recession began in most countries in February 2020. After a year of global economic slowdown that saw stagnation of economic growth and consumer activity, the COVID-19 lockdowns and other precautions taken in early 2020 drove the global economy into crisis. Within seven months, every advanced economy had fallen to recession.

>Abstract

>Growth theory is based on the assumption of exponential total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Across countries and time periods I find that TFP growth is
actually linear. Unlike the exponential model, the additive growth model provides
useful medium-term forecasts of TFP. It also explains the TFP slowdown and the
volatility puzzle, and predicts falling real interest rates. For the distant future the
model predicts ever increasing increments in standards of living but with growth
rates that converge to zero. For the distant past the model suggests that the size
of TFP increments has changed in the late 1600’s, the early 1800’s, and around
1930.",r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSZF9BUzBVVHhqSXJCX3VTbkRCaDVqNEhMenlvUjBvbTZlYml5V2taZzBweFNOLWpPcXptVVpOTUhiMnNCTUxob0hfVllvSUVDNTM3SExLYXdfaTFOYmc9PQ==
"Abstract:

>Some claim that the money multiplier is useless and ought to be   
consigned to the dustbin of history.  This paper shows that it is not   
useless, as it measures the degree of intermediation facilitated by a   
financial system.  I study several ratios specifically selected to   
measure the degree of financial intermediation overall, as well as the   
two steps necessary for intermediation: attracting funds and lending   
them. As the money multiplier is positively related to all of these   
ratios, it also measures financial intermediation. According to these   
measures, financial intermediation in the U.S. peaked in 1985 (using M2   
as the money supply).  Although intermediation plummeted with lending   
rates during the financial crisis of 2008, the data suggest that a   
relative decrease in deposits in the late 1980s that accelerated in the   
early 1990s catalyzed a drop in intermediation from its 1985 peak.

I’m drawn to this quote 
“Estimates suggest that fiscal support measures designed to counteract the severity of the pandemic’s economic effect may have contributed to this divergence by raising inflation about 3 percentage points by the end of 2021.”

I’m curious how they think the fiscal support to consumers drove prices up. What seems more likely is companies exaggerated their “need” to raise prices, and lack of competition leaves them no reason to lower prices. 

For context, on St. John USVI, triscuit crackers are $7.45 a box and tourists still buy them- there is no incentive to offer a more delicious chip cheaper because American consumers won’t boycott triscuits.

">What seems more likely is companies exaggerated their “need” to raise prices

It seems that you are using a layman's version of the medieval  ""Just Price"" concept. Gains from trade must relate to the exerted labor of the merchant. The price that goes far above that is a sin.

>If someone would be greatly helped by something belonging to someone else, and the seller not similarly harmed by losing it, the seller must not sell for a higher price: because the usefulness that goes to the buyer comes not from the seller, but from the buyer's needy condition: no one ought to sell something that doesn't belong to him.
– Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae

Modern view is that companies are profit maximizing, not price maximizing. Generally speaking profit is maximized when marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. That determines both the price and quantity produced.  Here is the classical view with diagrams: https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/3201/economics/profit-maximisation/

"I'm not about to hand you a fully crafted paper topic (thats your job lol) but a few guidelines:

1) something empirical, not theoretical. Unless you have a very strong math background already, constructing a novel proof or model is probably not a path to success as an undergrad. The best topics for undergrads are usually ones in a subfield that already has some fairly well developed models and methods that you can readily adapt and apply to a new dataset.

2) something with a relatively easily available dataset (or datasets). Suggest looking at publicly available stuff on data.gov or similar open data sites. There are whole treasure troves of under-studied resources on there. If your school has a data librarian, they can be a great resource as well.

3) something you are interested in. Start by looking at some data in your favorite analysis program, just exploring a few basic tables/charts/trends etc. If you can't think of any remotely interesting questions you want to try to answer about that dataset, maybe best to move on.

"It’s been a while since I did supply/demand graphs but I think this will be right. For C you need to plot the functions on a graph where price is the y axis and quantity is the x axis. Each function is just a slope intercept y=mx+b. The demand slope is an inverse of the supply slope because it goes down from left to right as opposed to up. QD graph has a negative slope looking like \\ while QS looks like /. So the equilibrium price is where they intersect. Plot the points for each function by substituting 0,1,2,3… for Q in each equation. In this case the equilibrium price is 18 because at Q=2 both equations come out to P=18. When you impose a 4£ tax it shifts the supply curve to the left, the new y intercept is 16 instead of 12 but the slope is the same. The new equilibrium price will 20 which makes sense because of the tax of 4. The Q at equilibrium will be 1.33. 

For d - a function by definition has only 1 y output for each x output so a function can’t be a vertical line.

Most macro papers are done in matlab, and even though julia can do more than matlab, it is used more rarely, and the fact that their syntax is very similar is helpful for transitioning from one to the other. Python is rarely used in my experience, but can be used for almost anything. I think that R is gaining relative to stata, but especially in the age of chat Gpt, translating from one to the other is pretty easy",r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSNmtjT2lfUlR0cjlMSWZTcEphV0JHUFoyLTlIUVh1QW1vd0NYT2ZQLTdmNFRiMEhaclBYRUNoaTY2SDczaVpDRldkLVVPczFXUHBERGFvVERLWFUtQWNnaVg1Q0YzcjNIVlBRdUdGUlZ0Q0E9
"That's not too optimistic at all, and in fact ideal, though I wouldn't worry about making them full blown installable python packages. A lot of the more sophisticated (or younger) researchers will have a git repo for each project or set of related projects. Gentzkow and Shapiro have a ""handbook"" of sorts you can probably find through Google that talks about good coding practices.

My point about how you don't need to worry about building up tools and libraries is that if you do Project A in Python, and Project B is not going to use any of the code from Project A, then you can write Project B in whatever language you want and it doesn't matter. Or if there's a little bit of overlap, you can port the code. So if you choose a language today, you're not going to be locked in forever. There will be little if any switching costs.

Very rarely (and never this early in your career) should you be spending any time or effort trying to turn your research code into some big Code Base like a startup. 95% of the time, once you finish a project, you'll never look at that code again. The remaining 5% is just borrowing data cleaning when you're going to use the same data source.",r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSYVlJTURTLVZNbFRTTXRkX09pZllIZ0FhdHlaUUpaYVFRYW85SkJiTHZkS290aU94NW1YRVo0VTd3ZllpTHVJLTFYeWFTZTJPTkxNYWY1WkVhd3FhTGplNWp5aTNhSkJNMlBUeUZXSWpzc0E9
"Recently I replicated some methods on causal effects using propensity scores.

"Predicting the programming language landscape in the next 5 years is nigh impossible as things evolve very fast and may get even faster. With the development of algorithms-who-code (based on LLM) we may get accelerating feedback loop effects. Ecosystems that have a lot of public code on which to train LLM's may benefit more from that dynamic and will become even more entrenched. 

Having said that, there are few factors that may be resilient drivers:

* It will *probably* be the case that open source platforms (like Python, Julia, R) will be even more dominant but the allocation of mind share between them is unclear. Python is the current darling and is likely to coast on that popularity for a while. The driving domain is obviously Machine Learning and Deep Learning but it is close enough for related fields to piggy-bag. But currently there are not an awful lot of economics related projects in Python.

* The tension between the end of Moore's law and the need to process ever larger datasets will put a premium on performant platforms that can easily leverage heterogeneous GPU / multi-core CPU hardware. With sufficient effort any language can be used in a performant way (e.g. using lower-level libraries) but the researcher's time is typically best spend on science not HPC. Pure Python is notoriously slow but its popularity creates enormous demand for performant re-implementations. There are new initiatives developing all the time, for example the Mojo project that aims to provide a performant superset of Python. Languages with more native concurrency (Go, Elixir) may become more important (but may still lack domain-specific libraries) 

* For empirical work sourcing data is important and (depending on the domain) may require significant pre-processing work. Famously 80% of data ""science"" is data cleaning. One could always use a toolkit approach (multiple languages), but as a general purpose language Python offers an advantage here.

All-in-all you need to continuously monitor the landscape.",r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSbWpnVC1VMFUxV2t6RXFGR3psUjdnaFFlRm93ZkFwcXpUUDFfUDM0NFlIWlQwNU9XWWw5Vl84d3VGWGVvblFZb3JfMDdsb1B6M2hMR01oNXUzUU5ESXc9PQ==
"I have a few friends who are computer science graduates; some in their phd some in the industry and they gave me a similar answer. This was also my way of thinking about it, as I have a couple of years of experience in sys-admin and devops. However, when I asked economists from my uni I got a different kind of argument. Network effects in academia hold back the adoption of new programming languages as you are kind of forced to work with what your advisor / co-author works with, unless what you are doing does not need to be in the same language necessarily.

As an RA I had to work in stata when working on things that I would have to share with the rest of team. When replicating papers I had to use the provided codes to save time.

"Moving from point B to F makes no sense. Budget going from deficit to surplus is a decrease in the demand for loanable funds (less borrowing). The demand curve shifts left, from D2 to D1. Assuming that tax credits actually change behavior, the tax credit increases the supply of loanable funds, the supply curve shifts right. The only movement consistent with that is from point C to A. 

Or the tax credit does nothing (like most tax credits) and you just move from point C to B. But the budget going from deficit to surplus inarguably decreases demand for loanable funds so you must start at a point on D2, either C or F.

Mainly due to the supply and demand meeting above the PC that was introduced - seeing that gives me the impression that the demand would be met allowing for a surplus to build but maybe I’m over thinking it - now in terms of the shortage since the supply and demand meet at Q2 would the shortage be equal to the difference between Q2 and Q3 rather than Q1-Q3; since they should be able to meet the demand in Q1?,r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV3ZoZEhoSTVvSVRwNHFHUzhuUTFQVElKT1JmUmU2RFhMWjNCeHlBTmVjdXJSbUlkcDFGaDRnbWp3dHpqbTlRQVZPOTB3bndJazRhOEJ1U0lLVTRpQWc9PQ==
"In the graph,P_E  is the equilibrium price where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. The government then imposes a price ceiling at P_C, which is below the equilibrium price P_E.

Due to the price ceiling P_C, the quantity demanded (Q3) exceeds the quantity supplied (Q1), leading to a shortage. The shortage is equal to the difference between the quantity demanded (Q3) and the quantity supplied (Q1).

Because of this mismatch in supply and demand, the new equilibrium point is at P_C, resulting in a shortage equal to the difference between Q3 and Q1.",r/econpapers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNnNaa3ZOWFFrTlN0YU5XWWZUWmx3ZEQ3NGdac0xmQjEzd1NtbmtoaG9KVU04UzluYTJ3UDUyRVAzemRlSkJsbzVMaklVUjBYM1BfeFFQRktMTkxWS3FFRGhwdkJTU2NEdl9iSEN1Zk9aQWM9
"For these types of questions, you should imagine the graph without the price ceiling line first, then add the price ceiling and see how things change. Supply and demand meeting at the middle (Q2) is the most efficient outcome without the price ceiling. Then adding the price ceiling changes the quantity demanded and supplied. 

With the govt enacting a price ceiling (an artificial lower price), suppliers only want to produce at Q1 because it’s not as profitable, but demand is high at Q3 because it’s cheaper.

"I think what you’re saying gives price “ceiling” its name.  The market clearing price would “naturally” occur at above the price ceiling.

But in all kinds of micro problems, it helps to put yourself in the shoes of the agents in the problem.  The other comment is obviously right but maybe this can help you think about the problem in a more systematic way.  

If you’re a consumer and you’re willing to pay $2 for a bag of chips, but the government holds the price to $1 at maximum, you’d probably buy more chips right?  So you previously wanted to buy Q2 bags of chips but now you want to buy… how many chips?

Likewise, say you’re a producer.  If you saw a price of $2, we know you are willing to make chips.  But imagine that it costs me $1.50 to make my chips.  If the government says I can only sell for $1, I would stop making chips right?  There might be some producers that make chips really cheaply, so they’ll still make chips.  So if some producers stop chip production, the quantity of chips produced should go from the market clearing Q2 to… how many chips?

From someone who has finished a fair amount of micro theory class work, a lot of micro can be done by just putting yourself in the shoes of someone in the problem and thinking about what they would do.
