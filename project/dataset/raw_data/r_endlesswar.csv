"[The cover you are talking about](https://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19960715,00.html)

Putin was not brought up by Yeltsin but more like was forced onto Yeltsin who in order to continue the looting had to accommodate opposing factions. Yeltsin's family and owner Berezovskiy intentionally picked someone low key and unknown expecting to be able to manipulate him and the faction behind him

Berezovskiy was NATO's point person on bankrupting and looting Russia and was exposed as the inside man funding and arming the chechen terrorists. The apartment buildings that were blown up to set off the second chechen war was his last spiteful attempt to turn the public against Putin when nothing else was working.

The one thing NATO planners got wrong was thinking a civil war or a terrorist campaign was going to break the will of the Russian people. Anyone who studied Russian history can see how much as a cultural ethos they place on enduring suffering. They spent centuries under Mongol and Tatar oppression and persevered. They survived multiple invasions by Poland who even occupied Moscow and tried to rule Russia. They survived invasions by Sweden where coincidentally some of what we now call Ukrainians were traitors and joined the invaders for payment. They had been invaded at least every century and at times multiple times per century. Everytime war is the uniting instead of dividing event. If  NATO did not fund chechen terrorists then they probably would have gotten away with robbing and balkanizing Russia but they were so cocksure that they just copied and pasted instead of treating that looting operation different all others they robbed.",r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaTRDVUw5dkh4c1BsRWVkY0RMcTd3RjVCVUxxRWUydWh0VVZSakxicmZac0tvOThaR0h3Nk9YRUhMTEpNZ1BOTTFVOHJZUHp2VVdVbTFXeGtHMHR2clE9PQ==

"You have a lot of missing details.

>In the latest leaked Telegram conversations, which are now official court documents, the level of illegal collaboration visible between the Lava Jato task force and the internationally promoted judge is the most flagrant yet, and more valuable for Lula’s defence than chats first published by the Intercept in 2019. 
The latest excerpts could result in the politically motivated case against Lula being annulled.
>Sergio Moro and Deltan Dallagnol have been accused of “treason” for their illegal collusion with United States authorities. In 2017, deputy US attorney general Kenneth Blanco boasted at an Atlantic Council event of informal (illegal) collaboration with Brazilian prosecutors on the Lula case, citing it as a success story. In 2019 the U.S. Department of Justice attempted to pay the Lava Jato task force a $682 million dollar kickback, ostensibly for them to set up a “private foundation to fight corruption”.
>On April 5, 2018, the day Lula was arrested by Moro, prosecutor Isabel Grobba revealed the news: “Moro orders Lula to be arrested,” head of the Lava Jato task force Deltan Dallagnol replied: “Before MA (Minister Marco Aurélio) screws everything up”. Dallagnol was referring to what Aurélio was then preparing; a Supreme Court vote which would potentially see defendants such as Lula freed from jail pending their second appeal.

>Had this passed, it would’ve enabled Lula to run for president at the 2018 election. Polling at that point showed him twenty points ahead of nearest rival, U.S. backed far right candidate Jair Bolsonaro.

>Jair Bolsonaro and Sergio Moro made an unprecedented visit to CIA headquarters in Langley after coming to power, with the backing of Wall Street.
>On June 27, 2018, Attorney Roberson Pozzobon asks for the ages of Lava Jato defendants, in a proposed effort to avert any chance of Lula escaping prison. In a sequence of messages he asks Moro: “We can survey the ages of our defendants. And give the names to them, specifically bring up those who were 70 before their sentence. Lula is one of the cases (sic)”. Pozzobon concludes the sequence: “I think it is also worth talking to Moro so that he considers this in the sentence of Sitio and Instituto (sic)”, referring to two other “backup” cases they were pursuing against the former President in addition to the notorious “Triplex” apartment in Guarujá.
>The FBI has massively increased its reach in Brazil since the election of Jair Bolsonaro and his Justice Minister Sergio Moro (who stepped down in 2020), and was in direct, legal and illegal collaboration with Lava Jato task force since its inception, with its main liaison and now head of FBI’s international corruption unit, Leslie Backshies, boasting that it had “toppled Presidents in Brazil”.In the latest leaked Telegram conversations, which are now official court documents, the level of illegal collaboration visible between the Lava Jato task force and the internationally promoted judge is the most flagrant yet,
and more valuable for Lula’s defence than chats first published by the Intercept in 2019.

"Remember Goldman Sachs being described as a vampire squid who's tentacles reach all across the globe? A conspiracy is just when a group of people conspire for a shared idea or cause.

Think of zionism as cosa nostra. Its just a pledge and an identification symbol. Part of the recruiting and selection process but not the actual goal. Ultimate goal of zionism is not Israel as a country but a globalist one world government. As they say with magician's tricks pay no attention to what the other hand is doing.

Israel to them only matters because that is where they want to place the ruling center of their one world government. Hence the ethnic cleansing of the natives and turning the whole land into a super fortress. They expect rebellions and people fighting back when they try to implement their one world government.

All Oligarchies are minority rule and they love centralization more than anything because it concentrates more power in their hands. The ultimate goal of oligarchy as mechanical and economic mechanism/system would be to concentrate all control over the whole world.

Any movement with such grandiose ambitions needs an ideology for it's foot soldiers. Just like in the italian mafia the mob bosses broke their vows all the time but would find justification if other mob bosses talked about it with them and blessed it. 

Same as with Catholic crusades where the crusaders were the worst sinners of europe and all they did was rape and pillage but the ideology protected them. 

The worst rapist and drug addicts joined Islam's earliest jihads and they were protected by ideology because they served ''the cause'' right? 

The demorats in US who were completely inbred prior to the Civil War but claimed to be representatives of racial superiority and everyone was banned from criticizing them and pointing out nasty birth defects. 

Pointing out any of those things during those periods would get you killed in those days. Because the ruling party ideology that functioned same as any group that claimed a monopoly on violence while demanding that you disarm yourself and submit to any and all rules they arbitrarily write or declare for you.

In US zionists sponsor politicians who demand gun confiscation, red flag laws and arrests for speech while in their zionist colony they offer their converts freedom of all the restrictions they imposed in countries under their covert control.

"Both were shut down by a plane that made visual contact. Not by a SAM or a ground system.

The Predator is a drone not a bomb. It has an active electronic signature. As did the balloon. They were transmitting electronic signals. You did not read my comments obviously.

The bomb does not transmit a heat signature nor an electronic signal after it's gps module corrects the course after being dropped out of the plane. It drifts in radio and energy silence.

There is a movie you might want to watch. It's called Night Witches. 

During WWII the Soviets had an all female bomber squadron. The planes they were given were bi-planes like the crop dusters we see nowadays. They would fly at night and bomb the Germans who never heard them coming because they would climb to peak possible altitude on approach and then turn their engines off on approach, coming in gliding over the german positions and releasing their bombs a second or two before firing the engines back on and trying to stop the free fall. (They did not always survive)

Radars did not pick them up because of those tactics so the germans swore it was witchcraft. Eventually the squadron became a whole battalion or regiment but don't quote me on that.

But the point is that radars track heat(energy) or electronic signals. They do not track bombs in free fall or in a glide. Is it possible to tune a radar for that? Yes. But are they tuned for that? No. Because you can only tune a radar for couple things while ignoring other things.

[ANDREI MARTYANOV AND SCOTT RITTER - NATO MEETS UKRAINE COLLAPSES - MISSILES DRONES CHANGE WAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAnlWg5kWpM)

* Russia is going to win, but it is costing them dearly in lives.
* The battlefield has completely changed because of drones.  There's nowhere to hide.
* The Russian Missile (I forget the name, not the KH101 though)  that can bury itself 40' deep into a concrete bunker (happened recently) before it explodes, necessitates going radio silent.
* Russia has no intention of moving into NATO space.
* NATO has ridiculously small resources to combat Russia.  (For example, the entire UK Army can fit inside of a soccer stadium and still have empty seats)
* The US no longer has forward deployed weapons systems.  If those system are put on a ship for (I think it was Hamburg) they'll have no where to off-load because the docks will be destroyed.

"let’s get this squared away. In 2024 anyone who believes the Ukrainian government is a nazi government is stupid. I’ll repeat that, anyone who genuinely believes Ukrainians are nazis is stupid. 
The only evidence for this statement is “Russia said so”. 

My mother’s side of my family is from Ukraine and I’ve been there pretty much once or twice per year for my entire life until the war started. Unless you’ve been there in person and saw people on the street collectively doing nazi salutes, shut the fuck up. You have zero clue about what you’re talking about. There is no difference in the debunked arguments you’ve said so far and the bullshit propaganda from three government approved news stations in Russia such as Russia 1. 

Also who are two European leaders who invaded their neighbors in a blitzkrieg style war to “protect native speakers over their borders”? Putin and Hitler. Who invaded Ukraine? Putin and Hitler. 
Who started the last two largest land wars in Europe? Putin and Hitler.  Who has conducted genocide in Ukraine? Putin and Hitler. 
My point is, Putin modeled the war in Ukraine after Hitler’s conquest of Poland in 1939. 

Next, your argument about Navalny is stupid too.
“Putin didn’t kill him, America did” 

If you do not provide concrete indisputable evidence for this claim then you lose the argument.

You’re shooting yourself in the foot with that argument too. Navalny was in one of the most top secure prisons in Russia.  Are you claiming that even though Putin directly put him in that prison colony, America was able to march into the front gate of the prison, get inside, and beat Navalny to death without anyone in Russia knowing? Are you claiming Russian prisons are ran by the biggest retards on planet earth who just let anyone walk into their prisons and do anything to their prisoners?

This massacre is what prompted the invasion.

This was after another massacre in 1948.

Try to image you are the Koreans who fought the Japanese only to have a foreign power (the US) reinstall the very same fascist administrators who worked for Imperial Japan you drove out of the country. Then these fascist war criminals start massacring patriots and disappearing people while running a brutal military dictatorship.

Then after you recapture almost your whole country that foreign power invades your country to keep the fascists in power. Bombs the everliving shit out of your country, uses biological warfare against you, then threatens to use nukes unless you stop fighting them. Then props up a fascist oligarchy who runs a police state well into the 1980’s, Al the while embargoing your country for decades.

"Korea sent in troops into territory US was occupying which means south korea was not and is not a sovereign state it is a territory of Korea that is a foreign colony.

Kiev is not a sovereign capital either because it has been invaded and subjugated to foreign rule. Just like with with South Korea it's government is under foreign command.

Donbas was invaded AFTER it declared itself a separate country from the one NATO invaded. And then NATO invaded Donbass and promised to conquer it. In fact NATO's nazi coup junta terrorist regime canceled the passports of all people living in Donbass and cut them off from pensions and government services. So pretty much NATO nazi coup junta terrorist regime considers Donbass a separate country if it canceled passports and other forms of identification for the whole region. 

The legal principle of forfeiture in this case shows that the NATO controlled, funded and armed coup junta terrorist regime renounced itself as the government of Donbass and invaded what they considered a foreign country.

">Korea sent in troops into territory US was occupying

And the North was under control of the USSR. So by your logic, neither were independent, but controlled by another state. So you accidentally argued that this wasn't a civil war. 

>Kiev is not a sovereign capital either because it has been invaded and subjugated to foreign rule.

Still not true, regardless of how often you say that. 

>Donbas was invaded AFTER it declared itself a separate country

Ah, the Donbas declared themselves to be separate. Just like the confederacy. So by your logic, the American civil war wasn't actually a civil war. 

I don't know if you've realised, but a lot of civil wars are due to a certain part declaring independence. 

>Donbas was invaded AFTER it declared itself a separate country from the one NATO invaded

NATO didn't invade anything in Ukraine. Didn't I ask you for a source for that multiple times now? As of now the only response I've gotten from you in regards to that was either ignoring me or calling me a Nazi. 



I honestly don't understand how you even manage to make up all that.

Seriously, you obviously are very passionate about the topic NATO and everything surrounding it. You obviously have very strong opinions about it. The conclusion of that would be that you obviously spend a lot of time looking into the topics. 

I genuinely do not understand how you spend time looking into these topics and come up with your conclusions. 

It can't even be the fact that you just believe everything Russia says, no. You have multiple times now, used numbers that are even more ridiculous than the numbers put out by the russian MOD. How do you even manage to be more unrealistic than the russian MOD? 

Are you aware how often you have redefined words? You are currently redefining the word ""civil war"" just to fit your viewpoint. You even denied that ""military aid"" actually exists. 

Seriously, how? 

Every Time I see your comments, I get more confused. The logic behind your view isn't even consistent. The only thing consistent behind your view is ""everything that America does is bad"". If Russia collapsed and Putin admitted that he was responsible for war crimes, you'd still find a way to justify that.

North Korea did not use foreign troops because they were a sovereign state, South Korea used foreign troops because it is not sovereign.

United States declared themselves independent from England and it wasn't a civil war because they did not claim their new name to anything to do with England. Donbass did not declare themselves Eastern Ukraine, they formed a new separate country.

Texas did not declare itself Northern Mexico, it declared itself a new Republic and Santa Ana invaded to conquer it the same way NATO's nazis invaded Novorossiya to conquer it. They did not invade Crimea back in 2014 because Crimea by then was a Russian Autonomous Republic and NATO's troops in occupied regions of Ukraine were not enough to invade Russian territory so they only invaded Donbass which was officially known as Novorossiya at that time.

"Not necessarily true. The Jeju massacre is 14k to 100k according to westerners in the article I linked and took place over months, it also sparked a rebellion in the southern most province on the peninsula which lasted until 1958.

Also NK claims the war started at least a year before we do when SK stated launching probing attacks into NK.

And the Bedu league massacre took place after at least a quarter million people were put in a reeducation program before the time we claim the war started. Up to 300k died according to western numbers after they started executing those people in late June 1950.

You are only referencing the lowball numbers.

"It always is. In this case it wont even be an insurgency but terrorist cells. Remember the nazis came to power via foreign sponsorship and are very unpopular among the populace. That is why it is always important to highlight that it is a foreign funded coup junta. Unlike say Taliban or Viet Cong who were grass roots locals.

Foreign funded terrorists like ISIS, Kurds, Ukronazis, Al Nusra, IDF/Mossad, MEK in Iran, Boko Haram, Al Shaab and Azov literally take pleasure in killing and terrorizing the local civilians. Peacekeepers want to eliminate as many as possible before they try to burrow and hide or unleash a campaign of terror before they flee. They hate the locals for not loving them and worshipping them.

As we see with nazi advocates of this sub, they hate ukrainian civilians for not worshipping the nazis and mock their deaths everytime the nazis mass murder people be it in Kramatorsk, Bucha, and most recently in Kiev.

"> Right-wing MAGA BS claims. Migrants/immigrants are coming for jobs, a better life and to flee global warming devastating the hotter tropical areas. Immigrants are forbidden from voting in federal elections.

I know you are anti-imperialist, but you have to realize that the ""climate change"" and ""immigrants coming for a better life"", might also be imperialist propaganda. With regard to climate change, if you mean it's not natural and it's from ""our co2 emissions"" that's a bunch of malthusianist bullshit, and if you want I can even show you ""scientifically"" why, it's there as a narrative to keep the imperialists coming off like they are ""saving the planet"". While they also are now supposed to have a say as to how third world resources are used, and why Africans shouldn't have cars and air conditioners (not to mention industries) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBE0RKbRbl4

As for the immigrants, the vast majority of all the immigration happens from wars and poverty set up by the US Empire etc. They pretend that Africans or South Americans are primitive and corrupt or something and that's why they are so undeveloped and poor.

"The “liberal” wing of the MSM has always made way too much out of Trump’s rhetoric regarding NATO. It was never that he’s anti-NATO it was just that he wanted European members to pony-up more, which, ironically and unsurprisingly enough, is exactly what liberals have been loudly demanding ever since Ukraine kicked off in earnest. He doesn’t actually have any sort of principled stance re: foreign relations, he just vaguely claims he’d do a better job with whatever his opponents are currently embroiled in — which is utterly unremarkable coming from a campaigning politician. He’s all in on the general concept of the projection of American “strength” and power, but has no distinctive ideas about how that should be done, which is great for the MIC, as they don’t really want any president calling the shots anyway. I would not be surprised if “he” *does* pull out of Ukraine, saying it’s a lost cause and stupid anyway — and then opens up conflict somewhere else, somewhere liberals would obviously rail against and would have been conflicted about under a Democratic administration, maybe Africa. What people don’t get is that, either way, whether under an R or a D, it works for the MIC, the multinational corporations and investment firms, etc. They just pick their battles and the narrative spin based on which wing of the uni-party is running the show.",r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaV2pncmJEWWt6ZTBYSHJRWVdSN3gtSHR2NTd2WVFhWUQxQ1lQcXlZd2ROUHdiOEpKSlF0elJ3UEVieUluaW14NVd6eGpLQlp1c2IxOU5fSmpqZXFEeUtwd1kxTmxKdXRpWjY4WEI3NWt6TUU9

"""western peace movement stopped Reagan doing this in the 80's"" this phrase is a lie on two counts.

1. Reagan DID deploy INF-type weapons in Germany in the 80s.  There were over 100 Pershing II MRBMs and about 50 Gryphon GLCMs deployed in Germany, along with locations elsewhere in NATO.  The peace movement didn't stop them at all.  See map here: [https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-inf-treaty-glance](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/intermediate-range-nuclear-forces-inf-treaty-glance)
2. The INF weapons in Germany were ultimately dismantled, but not because of the peace movement. They were dismantled pursuant to the INF Treaty along with all of their Soviet counterparts, which were what caused the crisis in the first place.  Why did the Soviets agree to negotiate the INF? Because the US countered the Soviet INF deployments with its own INF deployments, which incentivized the Soviets to seek like-for-like arms reductions.

In other words, one of the greatest achievements in arms control history happened because the US \\*ignored\\* the peace movement.  Had the US listened to the peace movement and just not deployed INF missiles...there would still be hundreds of INF missiles pointed at Europe, they would just be entirely Russian missiles.",r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZnhSRG53TDZfZTRrR1ZNTWNaTzRzYURleWpMVEdxak5ueGx1WVM3YlE2NEZzdmRNNFZxVUNMMTVUX1QtV0t3RHpIWUx6N0VIUWJveWdOWWFpbzZVZWlidENtNENLakx1d0xCbU0wbTZiUW89

"1, I’m not worshipping anyone, especially political candidates from countries on the other side of the planet. I simply pointed out that Navalny was murdered in jail by the order of Putin and now Putin directly initiated an arrest warrant for Navalny’s wife so he can do the same to her. 

2, what regions are the majority of Russian soldiers being drafted from?  Most Russians being drafted into the front lines are from Russia’s poorer regions. Anyone with a brain knows many of the poorer southern regions of Russia are predominantly Muslim (Chechnya) for example. 
Putin is drafting Muslims from poor regions of Russia to die on the frontlines while Christian Slavs from Moscow and St. Petersburg are being drafted at a comically low rate.  Why is this? This is because if people in Moscow notice 100s of thousands soldiers dying then they will protest (which they tried to at the beginning of the war before Putin made it illegal to protest).  People who live in the poor regions of Russia have less access to internet and are way less likely to make a fuss about it. 

The point is, I’m not defending Navalny’s political views, but if your argument is “he hates Muslims”, then my argument is “Putin is systematically drafting Muslims in Russia at an disproportionate rate when compared to Christian Russians. Therefore Putin believes a Muslim Russian’s life is worth less than Christian Russians.” Also what about all the Muslim Ukrainians that have died due to Putin’s invasion? Do they not matter? 

I can gather a list of many cases of Muslims who died because of Putin’s actions, can you generate me a list of Muslims who were killed due to any actions taken by Navalny?

"Not just demographics but also economics. During Soviet times the economy of Russia was sustaining most of the other republics and Warsaw Pact satellites. Poland was given 100 or 200 billion to join the EU? Most of the ex Warsaw Pact countries that EU gobbled up rely on subsidies. They are a net drain on whomever owns them at the time. Sure the resources get looted but they are not compensated at a fair enough value and the economy does not get as much of a return since the production of finished goods made from those resources are jobs in another country.

Without EU subsidies the economies of Baltics, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and even Greece would collapse. So why would Russia want to take on economies it would have to subsidize?

">one does not have to delve very deeply into the conventional military balance between Russia and NATO to realize that the Russian military would be badly outmatched in any war with NATO

Based on what exactly?  It isn't like Russia is going to ""kick ass"", but if the war remains conventional, Russia will win.

Yeah, I know, if Russia is so good why hasn't it defeated Ukraine yet?  There's more to war than conquered territory.

* Russia is waiting for NATO to ""join in""
* Russia is preserving the lives of its soldiers
* Russia is demolishing the AFU so they will never ever be able to reconstitute itself
* Russia is listening to the threats from Poland and standing back waiting to see if the Poles are stupid.
* Russia is listening to the rest of the world.  Victor Orban is looking for an ""out"".  Russia is listening.

The idea that NATO has so many better weapons is just ludicrous.  Those weapons have been tested on the Ukraine battlefield and found to be wanting.

The UK Army could fit into a single soccer stadium and still have room for thousands more.  The US Army can't fill its recruiting goals.  France just got its butt kicked out of Africa.  Most Germans are wondering what the problem is as they try to get through the economic downturn caused by the US blowing up the Nordstream pipeline. Russia, reportedly, has the potential of mobilizing 17 million.

This isn't a question about which side has the bigger dick.  The American Empire is dying, right before our eyes.  The idiots who control our government are psychopaths willing to die rather than face defeat.  

The US lost the war decades ago when it moved all of its manufacturing to China and totally financialized the US economy.  Something like 40% of US weapons systems require parts from China.  Yeah, sure, China is going to keep shipping those parts while the US goes to war with Russia.

So they started abandoning the treaties and nearly the next day announcing they had been mass producing the banned missiles which they successfully developed and tested illegally.

"It's not even imperialism physically anymore. New colonialism is financial. Debt slavery. Look at how enslaved people in the west are individually. Then look at every country that the west ever ''helped''. Who owns their resources and their infrastructure?

For example they crashed Greece's economy to force the government to auction off all the small islands that western elites coveted but could not purchase before.  Or look at Finland and the last 20 years of it being helped by EU and NATO? Nokia bought out and destroyed, forced to take in foreigners who refuse to assimilate and wont work because a man with four wives and 12 kids will be on welfare for eternity. They have crashed the Nordic Welfare States and now the native born who used to own vacation homes have to sell them off. Guess who is going to live in those scenic properties now?

People don't realize the main reason sanctions failed against Russia. It has minimal debt. It is a net exporter and advanced enough to self sustain every sector of it's economy. Not to mention it's technology sector is developed enough that it can copy any western tech but up until now was held back by international Intellectual Property laws.

Several developed nations for example can reverse engineer an i-phone or even Intel/AMD computer chips but the IP laws hold them back. Every piece of software the west ever produced has been hacked and modified but remains in vaults. Should the conflict escalate we would see IP protections no longer recognized and then a dozen countries could be producing not just i-phones but modifying them into better versions against the wishes of Apple Corporation.

What would happen if Apple suppliers were no longer INDEBTED or fear bankruptcy because Apple forced them to take on too much debt to expand their operations to served Apple better? This applies to almost every industry. Only those willing to take on debt were allowed by governments to rise up in their sectors as the dominant companies. And all that debt services banks who get unlimited currency printed out by central banks. You can be a genius capitalist, invent the best technology and a central bank can give 10 billion to Musk and 10 billion to Gates and 10 billion to Jobs and voila now they leader those economic sectors and all the capital you pooled to start your business is gone.

Khadaffi was killed because he made Libya debt free and announced he will help solve the debt of all of Africa.

"Picking and choosing your facts will not get you to the right conclusion. Let’s start with 1967 because up to that point Gaza was on trolled by Egypt and the West Bank by Jordan. There was no expectation of a separate Palestinian state (though to be entirely accurate Jordan was part of the original Jewish mandatee but was given to the Arabs and to this day is overwhelmingly Palestinian, I.e.., it is the actual Palestinian state). After the 6 day war in 1967 Israel offered to give up the captured territories in exchange for peace. The Arabs refused and ultimately they did a surprise attack in Israel in 1973- the Yom Kippur War. Israel ultimately won that war. Then Sadat, the President of Egypt agreed to make peace with Israel for the return of the Sinai Peninsula. The IsraeliS agreed because they always wanted peace and not territory. Sadat wanted no part of Gaza so it remained under Israeli control. Ultimately Israel decided to,turn over full control of Gaza to the Palestinian authority and removed ALL settlors.  There was no embargo an Gaza and the hope was that they would build a better place for their population. Instead Hamas murdered their fellow Palestinians and de opted all of the resources to building a military state and attacking Israel. While it is true that Israel tried to embargo goods that could be used for military purposes, we know now that Hamas freely brought in goods and weapons in tunnels along its border with Egypt. The fact that it used its money to bring in arms instead of civilian goods was completely on Hamas. Interest to note that Egypt has a border with Gaza so Israel never had full control over what went in and out of Gaza. On the other hand Egypt was forced to periodically crack down on Gaza because they were creating trouble in Sinai. That covers Gaza through October 7 except that leading up to October 7th Israel was allowing Qatar to send large sms f money to Gaza and allowing Oalestineans to work I. israel in the hope that Hamas would be more responsible if there was help in building the economy. Anyway, so what about the West Bank? Israel agreed to the Oslo peace process with the Palestinian Authority. Under Oslo the West Bank was divided into 3 jurisdictions. One area was (and remains) under complete Palestinian control. So the Palestinian Authority has for many years fully governed the Palestinian people in that part of the West Bank. Another part of the West Bank was to be determined in subsequent negotiations. This is where almost all of the settlements are. It was understood in Oslo that Israel was to end up with at least a part of this area because Israel had legitimate self defense needs (without this area Israel was only 8 miles wide and would be very vulnerable. (By the way there is no reason that UN ultimate Palestinian State could not have some Jews- unless you believe in ethnic cleansing. I note in this regard that Israel has 2 million Arab. Citizens with full legal rights). Anyway Israel made an offer to give most of the territory the Palestinians. They never responded or negotiated but instead started the first and later the second infatada. There were two other formal offers by Israel -  one with 98% of the West Bank. The Palestinians did not respond or agree to negotiate. Why you might ask.  Because it was never about land. It was about killing Jews which brings us up to October 7th. One of the most barbaric attacks ever - raping women and burning babies. There is no moral basis for this — period. And as outlined above the Palestinians have on numerous occasions chosen ethnic cleansing of Jews over peace. So you are right that it didn’t start on October 7th. The intransigence of the Palestinians predated that for quite a while. With no serious partner for peace Israel’s only course is self defense. Look at the history not the propaganda.",r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSWFYazRDZEMyeUcxaDJOeWZxdElHNjI2d05PdHZqZ192LXRtOXVpUTYyOUp4X3d2bEIwazhRMVk1Y20xT2xUV2o5TldMV3VMLWNia0dUdFN1QjF0dUE9PQ==
"Assuming what you say is true, then there appears to be contradictions. And cherry-picking scriptures where God seems to be blood-thirsty is obviously a problem.


And I think it could be argued that the alleged command to kill Canannites does not extend to Palestinians.



I do not disagree that Jewish claim to the land is any more legitimate than that of others. But both Muslims and Jews are fighting over the land while this scripture is an obvious command from God to love each other and co-exist.",r/endlesswar,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQWJBMG9lV21rZWVUY213VFVsNUg2cGRDX3dhb1VRazhaUjRIdVJucmc3dzlkQTE1LUN6dHFBeFViSDd4VkRmMmF5T2dWWEd3RjA4N1hpcHEzSk82OHhoQmlja1ZTN1FMWmIwd2k0ZDltcDA9
