I appreciate the article you just shared AND I would like to understand the nuances.

From your article shared: 
“Permitting of new coal power plants continued, with at least another 25GW given the go-ahead in the third quarter, based on a compilation of permits reported by Polaris Network.

The resurgence of coal-plant construction contradicts a policy pledge that China’s president Xi Jinping personally announced. Xi pledged to “strictly control new coal-fired” power generation projects” in China in 2021–25.”

"edit: clarified the specific electronics needed

They would need either a DC-DC regulator, or an inverter + rectifier. The latter don’t themselves necessarily need transformers. The reason is that the battery voltage will change as it charges, so will PV module voltage as the sun moves. But maybe the battery containers have their own and can connect directly to PV farm, though that one itself has some extra (comparable in cost) electronics to optimize module performance, balance the load and provide some resilience.

In any case, induction or arc melting both require further electronics to convert voltage.

As for setup, power ratings hint at the following: during the day (8-12h), half the PV power will flow to batteries, while at night(5h + solar “shoulders”), batteries will provide the power to plant.

The reduced round trip efficiency will punish a plant in two ways:

1. You will have to buy more electrical energy to fill the storage.

2. It will take longer time to fill the storage if you have a finite effect available for electrolysis/charging. This means that it will become more difficult to find hours where power is cheap enough.

"Since the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla is in Australia, you need to work in $AUD. Not $USD. Prices for things in Australia are often quite different to prices in the US.

Rather than work out the electrical efficiency, consider instead the round trip ""economic efficiency."" That would be the value of the output versus the cost of the input expressed as a percentage. Now, the input power is when there's an excess of renewable energy on the grid. The cost for this is very low, sometimes even negative. 

The output power OTOH is sold when there's insufficient renewable energy on the grid. The selling price for this is very high, sometimes astronomical. 

So, against your point 1, yes you will have to ""buy"" more input energy but at very low prices.  Sometimes even negative.  Sometimes, the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla will even get paid for absorbing excess energy. 

Against point 2 the electrolyser and the power output have about the same power rating. Roughly.  So it is a matter of what percentage of the time you are using the electrolyser versus using the output generator. 

So, in South Australia currently, there's about 75% renewable energy and 25% gas. So, there's an excess of renewable energy about three times as often as a deficiency. This will only get more favourable as more wind and solar farms are built. The gas is the expensive bit, every time renewable energy is available it is priced much lower than gas. So, the objective is to replace gas as far as possible.

In addition to the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla, there's about 3GWh, possibly 4GWh, of battery storage being constructed. 

So the economics of it all will sort it out. Modelling of the economics says that there definitely is a role for the hydrogen power plant at Whyalla. It will act to bring down power prices for the electricity consumers in South Australia. So that is why the taxpayers of South Australia (essentially the same people as the electricity consumers of South Australia) are building it.

Note that, being publicly owned, the objective is to lower the price.  If the power plant at Whyalla was being built by a private company instead, the objective would be different. Then, the objective would be pecuniary profit for the private company's shareholders.  In that case, that objective would be best served by higher prices for the electricity consumers of South Australia.",r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcjN1eXoyNGZjOXJkVDlqZ0JBZXQyeEtkSlZDRGkwemc3X09sRHVFa0gwYlRpTy0yVDdkNTNGazEtc0p2NkxRNWl2N2Mxak5ialBrckI1SmRORldUaUE9PQ==

1. Work in $AUD since the hydrogen power plant is in Whyalla,  not the US.  
2. The price for excess renewable energy from the grid is very low, sometimes negative.   
3. The selling price for dispatchable generation (when there is insufficient renewable energy)  is very high,  sometimes astronomical.  
4. South Australia currently uses about 75% renewable energy 25% gas. It is the gas which is expensive not the renewable energy.  
5. Point 4 means that the electrolyser can be used about three times as often as the hydrogen fired turbine generators are needed. This ratio will only improve as more renewable energy plant is built in South Australia.  
6. The hydrogen power plant at Whyalla will be publicly owned.  This means the objective is to reduce power prices for electricity consumers rather than make pecuniary profit for private power companies.   
7. So economics will sort it out, not considerations of round trip electrical efficiency.

"I don't disagree with this part:

> We all know renewables (more so solar) are cheap. Cost is becoming less relevant for projects though because if you can’t sell the power for anything above ~zero, it doesn’t matter how cheap development costs are.

With the exception of energy storage load which lets you release a portion of that energy later, new demand side variable loads don't really impact how the current rate payers are using electricity.

1. How cheap it to run a pervasive largescale bot/paid troll astroturf campaign.  We're talking a few million dollars here, well within the reach of most PR firms and the fossil fuel companies (and utilities with aging reactors) buying their services.  
   * These companies have deep pockets -- a *non-nuclear* fossil fuel powerplant is on the order of $1500-5,000MM, a reactor is on on the order of $8,000-10,000 MM; a few million to secure the investment is nothing to them.

"For those championing the approval of the massive solar farms please consider this.

2,000 acres of average farmland grows enough food for 100,000 people per year.  Some of this land is prime farmland which can feed more.

These farms cover an area of 7,000 acres, this country has just lost the ability to feed 350,000 people.  In return we have gained the ability to provide power for 300,000 average homes.  Note your average home doesn’t have heat pumps or electric cars yet which can dramatically increase the power consumption!  

So in reality we have sacrificed the ability to feed for power.  With climate change now affecting crops across the world it’s more vital we have an ability to feed ourselves as much as possible as crops we rely on will fail.

That land is now out of food production for 60 years.  When we need to bring it back to farming which will happen within 60 years the tax payer is going to be left buying out the contracts that have been funded by international investors that are just stripping the UK of yet more of our assets.

"So as you know passing sunlight through glass it produces heat, that’s why they came out with low-e and double and triple pane windows for homes and businesses. The ‘glass’ in a solar panel heats in sunlight and it builds up in the panel because they are made up of a material that naturally heats up. Then it’s released at a higher temperature than if it were to just be absorbed into the soil. The panels actually hold the heat and the ground absorbs the heat. The solar panels release the heat while the ground cools itself is probably a better explanation. Plants also absorb sunlight and use it to produce O2 and solar sights are farm land that is being built into solar fields.

"Because onshore wind is mostly worthless by comparison to offshore. There's a reason why the UK operates the largest offshore windfarm in the world and is a leader in that area.

The UK has three times as many onshore turbines as offshore turbines (\\~9,000 vs 3,300 or somtheing like that) yet offshore provides nearly 70% of actual output.

Offshore turbiens can be much larger and hence more efficient and more easily serviced and constructed by ships.

For land you are limited by the road network, bridges, inftrastructure and access etc.

You also need planning permission, public consulation, payments to the land owner (rent or purchase), survey, restrictions on where you can place them due to flicker, SSSI, AONB or other protected areas etc.

"Man do you not know what you're talking about.

Onshore wind isn't useless; it's significantly cheaper to deploy than offshore. Yes, the scale must be right, and it at sea you can install huge machines. But onshore has a role to play. 

Servicing offshore turbines is difficult, dangerous and expensive. We do it brilliantly but it's much easier to drive up to the base of an on-site turbine to fix something. 

Offshore wind farms are bound by the same planning laws as onshore, and your clearly unaware that almost all off-site projects have onshore enabling works that also require planning.

"Just out of curiosity and with no offence, why is your master dissertation about a topic you know very little about?

The article says the 139 $/kWh is a volume weighed average, so it considers all the technologies and the amount that it’s produced of each of them. The second paragraph separates them, showing that LFPs are the cheapest technology so far. China has dominated the LFP market, so that’s one extra reason why they are much cheaper on average, because the production in the USA and Europe is usually more expensive, but these 2 markets had been producing NMC or others but little LFP up to 2023.

">Does this term include all types of LIBs including LFP, LCO and NMC - would $139/kwh be an average cost of all types of LIBs? 

seems yes, and they do weighted average (not average price between types, but average between all sold batteries) as share of LFP was not high, though it grows (probably  20% of all batteries were LFP batteries as of time of the article writing) LFP cost  has less effect on average pack price.

packs and cells have different level of integration - packs consist of connected cells with addition with control modules etc, non connected cells cost cheaper.

end user likely would use packs, not separate cells.

also in China battery packs are already in \\~$60 kWh range, so price now also depends on  market.

as a personal note: for me it looks like it is less useful to just project only lithium ion batteries, li-ion will dominate for at least a decade, but share of sodium ion and then semi solid and solid batteries will start to grow, apparently this will introduce quite a change in the picture of where which batteries are used. For example it might turn out that sodium ion will dominate storage market and some markets will completely transition from li-ion to semi solid and solid state batteries.

"Battery prices are often described as ""at the pack level"" or ""at the cell level"" and as long as you specify what number you are using people don't care.  

Cells are what comes out of a battery factory - they fit in your hand and you can buy them on ebay. [Packs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TXCM9_3SbM&t=55s) are lots of cells + everything you put around the cells to turn it into an automotive product: wires and fuses, inverters/rectifiers, thermal system, structural support, sensors, waterproofing, fireproofing.

LFP is the cheapest chemistry in mass production today with an energy density of ~180Wh/kg. NMC is more expensive because nickel and cobalt are expensive, but has an energy density of ~250Wh/kg and can charge a bit faster. So if you see a low $/kWh its probably LFP. High $/kWh is probably NMC. A number in between is probably a weighted average. I think last year LFP had 40% of the global battery market and growing fast.

"Number of units is like comparing solar panels to wind turbines, you can't compare them by count. Offshore wind is 2-4x bigger than land based but also more expensive. You have to compare them by cost per MW, where offshore is cheaper and provides more power but not by a huge difference to onshore.

Land siting is an issue and in the UK it's mostly scotland that has a lot of good potential. You want high altitude and good consistent wind speed. Offshore wind is good but onshore has advantages too. You get a better performance and a more stable grid for having a short transmission line. Basically you will want to put wind turbines in all the very good spots on land to get your best return.

EDIT: just to clarify what i was referring to in the first paragraph, the learning curves for wind and pv have remained largely consistent for the last 2 decades, especially PV. for context, energy storage appears to have a learning curve somewhere between wind and solar. it's hard to imagine how something may be done differently when you do not wish to.

"few years back it was popular theme for anti electric batteries bots to claim that li ion batteries are difficult to recycle, now there are technologies to recover back metals (CATL announced something few months back, for example).

there are other things - like geothermal brine lithium mining, switch towards nickel rich li-ion (more capacity less cobalt) batteries, arrival of m3p batteries (something like LFP but also with manganese) etc, improvements with LFP (there is some improvements over current 180 Wh/kg energy density)

  
for Na-Ion - yes, it's unlikely that Na will be recovered from batteries anytime soon, but Na mining is much simpler and more ecologically friendly, than Li mining, Na is essentially available everywhere for battery production (so no supply issues)

then again - in case of progress with solid state batteries (if one combines all existing patents from US,  China and Japan it seems most of the problems are already solved and we will see a lot of solid state batteries in early 30s, but patents might not be shared in case of tensions) - less need for nickel and cobalt which are potentially most  supply constrained

"For EVs it's going to be a bit difficult. As others have mentioned you need to look at the difference between cell, module and pack prices and stick to one to have a good comparison. Always triple check your sources which of these prices they are talking about!

*However*, there are several trends in buidling cars where these difference get iffy. Currently many automakers are going for a cell-to-pack approach (skipping the module level).

The next step that is being worked on by everyone at the moment is cell-to-chassis (sometimes called cell-to-body) where you don't even have packs anymore but the cells are integrated directly into the body of the car. This is another step for cost savings.

So the 'safest' way to compare prices going forward is on cell level and then separate out what kinds of costs are added if you want to do modules, packs or cell-to-body directly.",r/energy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaFREQ0h1am5qclRXR21nNFpqSENDS3pWX2V0cFBSa2d2c2J3RzFSQlBmYm4tcVhZVGtsMXl0eHdNeHNkaUVfd1g5U05XT0t5Y3VuaGFoSWdJMTNrbGc9PQ==
"It's a massive difference.

You need almost four land based turbines to match one offshore. The reality is 2/3 of energy is generated offshore, by 1/3 of the turbines and that was in 2018, 6 years ago. There have been massive expansions since then, in both farm number, size and turbine size.

Several offshore sites cover 250sq miles each with 150+ turbines. Good luck building anything close to that onshore. You'd need to build 600 onshore turbines to come close and they sure as anything arn't going to be in the same place and thats *per site*. There's multiples of these beign built of in planning

That's before we even start getting into actual operational hours and quality of wind and the availability of spaces to build them onshore.

Land connections are low impact and hardly recognisable once built, im surprised the poster before even mentioned them.

You can also place your production and maitinance facilities in one nearby port that can access all the farms and export components. Large equipment like the substations is built in one go here and then transported to site by submersible ship, where ever it's needed.

With an adequate mix you can minimize the amount of storage needed as wind and solar complement each other in some respects. Depending on cost it may also be advisable to install a bit of overproduction capacity to shorten the intervals where storage is needed and accept some loss of potential production.

"Ecosystem services are vital to wildlife health and when managed right can keep our natural habitats in good health which has tangible effects on our climate. 

The landscape is essentially a naturally evolved solar farm designed to trap carbon in the soil as stored fertility. At the moment commercial interest has developed global agricultural systems to be far away from the consumer and over reliant on artificial inputs that aim to oppress and manage wild ecosystems.  There are real efficiencies to be gained from lowering artificial inputs and managing the landscape with bio diversity and soil health principles. Something that can't be done after you have set your concrete footings and pads for the infrastructure needed.

In Wales, it is proposed that farms aim for 10% tree cover in order to receive extra payment. Currently the average for Wales is 6% to 8% depending on region. This is an achievable aim however the financial pressures on farmers mean they can't afford to plant these trees. To plant a tree, and keep protected while it's young from cattle and sheep, can cost up to £40 each. Farmers are insecure about where that money is coming from and if they don't find it will lose income and likely have to close business. The government needs to communicate better with the farmers who know the landscapes they work in and help them transition away from artificial inputs and monoculture cash crops.
