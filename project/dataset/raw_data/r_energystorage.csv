"You have a few options. But selecting the best option depends on many factors such as design life, load profile, seasonal variation, electricity tariffs, etc.

I do consulting in this space (feasibility studies, design, procurement, etc). Usually Li ion, flow or sodium sulfur batteries have a similar levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) with 5-10 year life but flow and NaS are even better for 10+ years. Usually a hybrid solution (grid connection plus renewable system) provides the lowest LCOE.

If you are expect to install EV chargers then that changes the game again. EV chargers are relatively high loads. This means you might max out your grid connection limit and you need a battery that can handle the higher power requirements.",r/energystorage,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTb04yWER5a3BJeFFKM1hfVnZNWExsT3FqMXJkdmN3S3JPc2JLT3Jja1pCcEpYWTA0WW9hSnFTLTZoNndYQ1Q0NXFRR3pEUnFiaWJPbkZELUVIa3MyTVE9PQ==

"This is measuring the cost of home battery installations. The storage revolution is happening at the utility scale, not at the residential scale. At the residential scale the cost is dominated by costs like business overhead/profit (21%), sales/marketing (20%), permitting (9%), and skilled installation labor (6%).

None of the e stops working 

Water ingress issues leading to fires

Battery racks failing during sea freight dropping modules onto one another. 

Fire alarm systems with no local support and inferior products

Deflagration protection systems not designed adequately either in fan sizing, panel sizing, or detection

Interesting. I will check out the webinar. The firm I work for has about 1 GWh of BESS deployed and another 2 GWh in or planned for construction this year (all in ERCOT) and have not seen any of these issues at a material scale.

We only use Tier 1 suppliers and mostly buy fully integrated AC block solutions. I have not heard of these sort of issues from any of the lenders or tax-equity investors we work.

"Given the volumes from most of these suppliers CEA (and some of the other IEs) has teams essentially assigned full time to their facilities. My experience with the suppliers (BESS and cells) we work with is basically that they assume we will have our own people and/or third-party inspectors involved. Most of the facilities have full ISO certifications and are very automated and do their own third-party verification as well. I actually think the lending community and owners are probably getting comfortable enough with some of the major suppliers that they won’t expect as much oversight. There are issues with getting third-parties into some of the raw material supply chain but that’s less of a quality issue and more related to ESG requirements.

"They all will make it because they're not competing with one another.

'Mechanical' storage like hydro will remain cost effective where it's basically for free (i.e. where the geography is already right for it and water is available).

Electrochemical methods (i.e. batteries) are best for power storage (which doesn't require long term storage - at least not to the extent most people imagine), because they minimize the knock on costs on power production and transmission infrastructure.

Heat storage - and potentially even cold storage - is the only thing where 'seasonal storage' actually makes sense...and that must be super cheap because the storage doesn't get cycled often (basically once or twice a year).

Also there's always some biowaste/biogas which will be available for storage and can be used for power or heat as needed.

"> I see a \\~1% rate of modules requiring replacement during commissioning, higher with older air cooled equipment.

I'd like to hear your thoughts on air cooling versus liquid cooled modules.  

If air cooled modules of the past are inferior, it that the result of poor design/implementation or is there something inherent about water cooling that makes it better ?

If a design pushes enough cool air around the cells why wouldn't it be better cooling than cells sitting on a cooled water plate that allows only cooling from the bottom with no air flow ?

"One way to store hydrogen is in isopropyl alcohol. The selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of organics with transition metal hydrides is a promising strategy for electrosynthesis and energy storage. This is the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of acetone with a cyclopentadienone-iridium complex in a tandem electrocatalytic cycle with a cobaltocene mediator. The reductive protonation of cobaltocenium with mild acids generates (C5H5)CoI(C5H6) (CpCoI(CpH)), which functions as an electrocatalytic hydride mediator to deliver a hydride to cationic Ir(III) without generating hydrogen. Electrocatalytic hydride transfer by CpCoI(CpH) to a cationic Ir species leads to the efficient (Faradaic efficiency > 90%) electrohydrogenation of acetone, a valuable hydrogenation target as a liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC). Hydride–transfer mediation presents a powerful strategy to generate metal hydrides that are inaccessible by stepwise electron/proton transfer.
