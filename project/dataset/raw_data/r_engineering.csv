"The book answer claims that a correctly designed joint shouldn’t require exotic vibration resistant magic solutions. Obviously the book and reality rely on a different set of underlying assumptions.

Question 1: are the screws strong enough for the joint under the applied loads? If they are strong enough, are they being installed with the correct torque for the joint design? If the screws need to be larger or they are being installed loose, you’re going to have a bad time.

Question 2: if thread locker adhesives are failing, are the threads properly cleaned first? Properly applied, locktite works very well in a broad range of applications. Every time I’ve had adhesive performance issues, it comes back to surface preparation.

Question 3: what are the materials involved? What are the joint materials? The screws? The coolant? Since water based coolants are most common, I really don’t expect that’s causing the locktite to fail.",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVDhkaExPaXVjaDdseExENjNmbFg4UTY1blNhR21XTE9SQU1Td1Axd29QZng3RUJ0V1JQSFpIdjAydmRZZ0RZam1fYkQ4REZ6RWpiN1VUTVp6UGdUWVE9PQ==

"I'd guess you have a contaminant like oil or water or something that prevents the loctite from bonding.  Also, IIRC, the Permatex version takes and hour or two to reach 80% strength according to it's datasheet.

I don't know the composition of thread locking compounds but if it is superglue (high shear strength) mixed with some other things....then superglue crystalizes (cures/hardens) with water (or your coolant???), usually from the humidity in the air.

Also, don't use red loctite unless you can get a serious torch on it.  You have to get the metal to +500 degF for it to soften.  Please use blue or another non-permanent thread locking compound.  Blue is usually better anyway because it gums the threads up and doesn't necessarily require as much of a surface bond.  Red is kind of it either bonds and holds or it doesn't bond and fails.",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYaHpWQW1TZGl2SWhLcjJYajMzbExVYVpGTldVZU9XS256TmRUZzRCMUlwal9ja25hV0Q0MXNWQ2c4NktIcGtKYmVQOHFudF9MT2FucTlxMG5peWc3Nnc9PQ==

"Administer the professional registration process on behalf of the Engineering Council. You mention engineer is not a protected title, but the four professional titles, ""Chartered Engineer"", ""Incorporated Engineer, "" ""Engineering Technician"" and ""ICT Technician"" are.

Provide input into parliamentary consultations.

Play a role in or directly publish industry standards, e.g. the IET maintains the IET Wiring Regulations which are part of the building regulations.

Publish a ton of technical journals and other technical and academic literature and host technical conferences.

Run various industry awards programmes, generally help recognise achievement and provide networking opportunities for engineers at all stages of their career. 

Raise the profile of engineering with public outreach, eg STEM education programmes.

Most if not all provide a professional advice service, eg for independent ethical advice.

Many provide a benevolent fund for members falling into hardship.

They do quite a bit.

RAEng speakers are on the BBC pretty frequently, and a lot of the academic speakers are fellows of PEIs.

But all institutes also do a massive amount of STEM education outreach, eg:

"I have _never_ seen a representative of a British engineering institution on television. Maybe there are people on television who are secretly part of engineering institutions, but they keep it well hidden.

"Was originally  a very important part of Engineering career. Now more of a political lobby group (with little member consent). They seem to have lost their edge by offering protected titles to less qualified members. Those protected titles have very little portability outside of UK, which is a real shame.

"You can actually look up what the PEIs spend their money on in their Annual Reports. 

People often point at the IET's Savoy Place as an example of ""bad spending"" but the IET has owned the building for a long time, so its cost to members is actually relatively little.

Taking the IET as an example, they spent:
- 36,528k on Knowledge Services and Solutions - this is the biggest expense and includes all their conferences, publications, regulatory committees, etc.
- 20,216k on Membership and Professional Development - administering the professional registration process, development programmes, etc.
- 6,319k on Education, Policy and Awareness - STEM education, outreach, policy consultation, etc.

The membership fees balance almost exactly with the Membership and Professional Development spend. The rest of the expenditure is covered by income from other sources - charitable grants, investments, and income from Knowledge Services (e.g. journal subscriptions, conference tickets, sponsorships).",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZb0Ixa1l0WmtaQjhMN1VXajVYTmpqeElad2VNMlplc3ZpeVdCWUZucWR6UVN3RklPSnlES2c4a1FCLVc5MEYwMWY5bGdHcFR6UmIwcS1UWW1FMS1IQ01RUFJadkhWY25MV2x4alV2OVBTck09

"I often think of it as an “Engineering Tax”. They do have input into some parliamentary committees etc. and they do host things in London.

But the access the provide to any groups outside of London is pretty poor. In the north east it’s really the Volunteer Local Committees that do all the heavy lifting. 

My biggest gripe however is the IET Online Library is so poor. So much is behind paywalls etc. The IEEE in America is so much better at providing their members access to technical papers/standards/proceedings. I would love that level of access for those of us outside of London.

Less IET Dinners and extremely lightweight magazine content!!

"Membership in engineering institutions was initially a lot more important, when civil (ie non-military) engineering was becoming recognised and certified. They provided confidence that a member would follow strict ethical requirements (eg safety over profit) when there wasn’t much else that would demonstrate this.

"About £2m of that goes directly to the UK Engineering Council in registration fees.

Roughly £8m is the direct cost of administering the scheme - headcount to support the pre PRI checks and run the PRI process, train and administer the volunteer PRI and PRA networks, expense reimbursement to volunteers, verification costs, payment processing costs, etc.

It's not just CEng either - it's all membership programmes, fellowship, corporate memberships, accreditation of degrees, graduate and apprentice programmes, etc.

The remaining £10m is overhead - Finance, IT, Offices and Buildings, HR and Legal/Governance cost. That's not out of line with other PEIs or with charitable entities in general.

1. There’s usually a few supporters in a company, who exaggerate its importance. And they support it for their own self importance, and most I’ve met are not real Engineers or for some reason are retired senior officers in the Military who call themselves Engineers. 

2. About 95% of the real and actual design Engineers think it’s a waste of time. And get harangued into joining by their boss, who also thinks it’s a waste of time.

When I was interviewed it was with: 2 Wing Commanders and Navy Commander. I had forgot more than they knew, in fact they had zero design knowledge, and they knew it too, one tried to get smart with me. Thats when I decided to just play the game.

"It is a club.  You do not have to be a corporate member or fellow in order to be a fully qualified and practicing engineer.  Indeed.  If you want to become a member and be a Chartered Engineer then you must prove that you are an engineer and have  been a practicing engineer for a number of years.  It follows that if you can prove you are a practicing fully qualified engineer in a responsible position then you will remain so weather you apply for membership or not.

The most useful thing (for me) about being a Chartered Engineer was it allowed me  to become a European Engineer; certainly when the UK was a member of the EU this was a useful registration; less problems signing engineering contracts in mainland EU countries.  When in Europe was the only time I was ever addressed as doctor, another title that is neglected, or even resented, in the UK unless you study medicine.

The UK Institutes have increased the degree requirements to the level of a masters degree; this failed attempt to get status that engineering does not have has resulted in very few engineers bothering to seek membership.  Those who study for a BSc are already in enough debt.  As no recruitment advertisement ever askes for or requires CEng, why bother.",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcWQ4bGJNczdmenpDb3pJS2wxUTA2Nmw1a3ZnQnVacjVNN3REZ0x6SHE0NmhQekloTlktYlAxcmVUU1RYUXpvamhmU1RzdHp2UmlyZ2FlTWRsZWZRMjZQM2tOd09vTEZtYlB3S2JiX2ROc0k9

"-10dB sounds like half to most people. Almost no one can hear a 1dB change, and 2-3dB is the threshold for most people. 

In Windows device sound properties, in the levels tab, you can right click the slider and change the scale from percentage to decibels, then play with it to hear for yourself.

"Applying for Engineering Jobs

So I need to start looking for jobs and trying to find someone to hire me when I finish my masters in integrated engineering next year. To be honest I really have no idea what sort of engineering I want to go into, I don’t really know all the available jobs out there either. This course has set us up to be project managers in a way but you obviously can’t just go straight into that as a first job and I don’t know what sort of projects I’d even want to manage. 
So yeh I was hoping for some direction into what jobs, areas or companies I could look into (I live in the uk). I’m awful at electronics but I suppose with some training I could learn how to do that? and I don’t particularly find the automotive industry interesting so I’d like to avoid those. As for things I enjoy or I’m good at, I find geology, CAD, designing, CFD, renewable energy, environmental, coding (although I’m not very experienced in coding), process optimisation (that’s quite a boring one tho) and research and development interesting.",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabGxEZEFRTy1kQmZFdy1NQUdkQTdXTHRjRjAwSEdyQTMwQ1JjUWF6ZGtQVWRqbEkyc1M4Z3pNRV9QR2xfZUZsMFFUZU0xU21XMHRSN1BmUExPM2otMGRMbUtIZVJpc1d5UF90RlpKMDBfbHc9

"I once worked with a machine that generated a stupid _ridiculous_ amount of static because it used circulating, warm, dry air to move plastic powder in vinyl tubing. The static would arc across several inches of open airspace, and it made a crazy popping noise. 

I grounded _everything_ to make it stop. Plastic output bag? Grounded. Actual machine? Grounded. Vinyl hoses? Grounded. 

I trained a guy to run it.  One day he forgot a grounding wire. He remembered when it shocked him in the zipper in his pants. 

Can you ground the enclosure with a conductive grounding strap, so that while transporting it, the device is constantly dissipating static?

"Opportunities for a Non-Traditional Engineer

Hello everyone, I would love to receive some guidance and clarification from anyone with experience in an engineering role/company. I’ve recently started pursuing a B.S. in Engineering with Embry-Riddle, it’s a non-specialized online degree in Engineering that’s ABET accredited, going to a physical school isn’t possible for me as I am in the Military and plan to get my degree before I get out. I am curious how potential employers look at this type of education. I’m worried that I’ll put in a lot of effort toward getting a sheet of paper that won’t be taken seriously by employers. I chose the program because it’s accredited but the more I complete the more I start to doubt the benefit. Does anyone here know someone who took a route similar to mine or received their degree from Embry-Riddle or similar online programs? I don’t know any engineers and I am hoping that it’s not as uncommon as I think.",r/engineering,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnOTBHTk8yYkxlZnZIOW81N0VYWk5iRVFNb2g1XzczX2psRVFZSGx4b3pGYUN4cEVUU2N5UFJwWmFUSHJROS1CMUlZVzdGNC1iRmMwWUxlT1JKV0dhMmc9PQ==
