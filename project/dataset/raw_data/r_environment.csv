"> Europe and to some degree the US have lowered their emissions in the last 30 years

Again, that's ultimately an accounting trick as developed countries outsourced their most polluting industries to the third and second world countries with the rise of globalisation - that way they get to shift the blame on countries like China, highlighting that they have officially surpassed the US in annual emissions, etc. Even the introductory Wikipedia article I linked states many times that decoupling rarely works in practice and is far too little to avoid further environmental degradation. 

Pulled directly from the article:

> Studies have found that absolute decoupling was rare and that only a few industrialised countries had weak decoupling of GDP from ""consumption-based"" CO2 production. No evidence was found of national or international economy-wide decoupling in a study in 2020.

And below this, there is an entire section dedicated to the lack of evidence for decoupling.

Decoupling is part of a broader ideology called [ecomodernism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomodernism) and is the ideology favoured by the capitalists as it enables them to keep doing business as usual. The main competing ideology to it is [degrowth ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth), which is inherently antithetical to the capitalist model which requires indefinite growth.

"It's easier to die with high humidity, all things being equal.

95 degrees Fahrenheit with 85% humidity means a wet bulb temperature of 32.4 degrees Celsius- it's well-accepted that a wet bulb of 32 degrees Celsius prevents normal outdoor activities. It's a 131 degree Fahrenheit equivalence. 

A 35 degree Celsius wet bulb means potential death within six hours, but a 2022 study showed that a wet bulb of 30.55 degrees Celsius was critical when performing at modest metabolic rates.

120 degrees Fahrenheit with 5% humidity means a wet bulb temperature of 19.2 degrees Celsius, a huge difference. Your perspiration can and will draw heat from your body and cool your skin. Light, long sleeves, light pants, and a sun-shading hat will keep your skin shaded.

No, it can't. Coal is a finite resource. It takes hundreds of millions of years to form, and will never form again as the prehistoric conditions required to form coal no longer exist.

We should be conserving our coal supplies as it's the only way to make steel. Wasting it on power generation is lunacy. It's pollutive and inefficient.

"For years, scientists have worried about “forever chemicals,” substances used to make hundreds of household items that have been linked by research to a wide range of health problems. In response, a growing number of companies [have pledged not](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/12/20/3m-forever-chemicals-pfas/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) to use the chemicals, and regulators have [increasingly taken](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/19/epa-rule-pfas-hazardous-water-contamination/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) aim at them.

But even as work continues to phase out the substances, scientists are beginning to focus on new types that are far more widespread than earlier realized — prompting worries about undetected health risks.

A growing body of research has raised concerns about a forever chemical known as TFA, which is short for trifluoroacetic acid and has been found in increasing amounts in rainwater, groundwater and drinking water.

The chemical has a composition that scientists say may make it especially hard to filter, although scientists lack consensus on whether it poses a human health risk.

"This is tricky — please don't misunderstand. I am all for switching to wind and solar and nuclear asap. But we have to be honest. 

Watt-for-watt, it’s probably true that solar is cheaper than coal and gas. It depends on which power plant we’re talking about and how they get their fuel. transporting it halfway across the country isn’t cheap. But there are also coal fired plants right next door to coal mines too. 

Now consider than coal and gas are 24 hours per day suppliers. Solar is only available (on average) six hours per day. Even if overnight storage is free (which, it is not), then you’d need *four times* the wattage rating for a solar plant than for one coal plant to get the same kWh per day.

"I do agree that precious fossil fuels should be conserved, but there's no way to put coal as more precious than oil and gas. There is far far more coal especially in the USA, and most of it is not metallurgical quality it's sub bit or lignite. Natural gas is way more scarce and way more useful for portability and transportation.

You could run a plane on natural gas in the future, but never on batteries or coal. I will support fission, especially large traditional plants - AP1000's and stuff we already know how to build. But, very little solar pairs well with nuclear, less than 10% to knock what would otherwise be a slightly higher 12-3pm peak back to a slightly lesser 4-7pm net demand peak. Any more than that and the solar is just duplicated capacity. If you have the nuclear to support your 7pm sunset load, then that's enough to support 90% of your 3pm load.

Now keep in mind that those peak profiles are based on the consumption of natural gas at home in the winter.

Not enough studies have been done yet. The only hope I see is that advances in medicine will somehow be able to protect from, or even remove PFAs from the body. But only if you can afford it.

These are the known issues that affect the body:

'A team of N.Y.U. researchers estimated, in 2018, that the costs of just two forever chemicals, PFOA and PFOS—in terms of disease burden, disability, and health-care expenses—amounted to as much as sixty-two billion dollars in a single year. This exceeds the current market value of 3M.'

They should be forced by law not only to stop all manufacture of PFAS/PFOS and all the other alternative C-F bond chemicals in production or development, but also to clean up all existing. And each shareholder personally named and sent a bill for cleanup or jailtime. 

Here's one way to cleanup:
'Electrochemical process' and UV to get rid of PFAS:

At ambient temperature and pressure, the UV/S–EO realized near-complete defluorination and mineralization of most PFAS and organics in AFFF (50–5,000 times diluted, containing up to 200 mg l−1 organic fluorine and 3,764 mg l−1 organic carbon). This work highlights the integration of molecular-level insight and engineering design towards solving the major challenges of AFFF water pollution.

">because the vast majority of chemicals in use have never undergone any safety testing.

This is overblown. For starters, we are simply being more conservative about what it means for something to be unsafe. BPA is a great example. Are there concerns- sure. Does it warrant using alternatives in plastics for storing food- absolutely. Is this a big deal? No. No one is going to die or have an otherwise altered life. We are just being cautious. But read any news article and BPA is a dreadful toxin that's turning boys into girls.

Chemicals that have significant toxicity cannot just be quietly swept under the rug without mass effect. Asbestos- and actual mass safety concern could not be hidden away. Bhopal, a massive uncontrolled release of methyl isolcyanate could not be hidden and denied. Chromates/dichromates, despite significant legal obfuscation, could not be passed off as insignificant pollution.

PFAS have been around since before Teflon was popular. If they were of significant health concern we would already be seeing strong evidence of it. Sure, this is a wake up call to control discharge of PFAS into water ways and to monitor waterways for contamination. Sure, it is a call-to-action to understand the bio-degradation pathways and determine what environmental limits should be. But outside of its flagging of systemic regulation issues, it's a rather tame issue. Even if there are significant impacts, it's no different from CFCs - something that we can bring together informed policies to actually create change.

The politicisation of industrial effluents is a concern from both the left and right. This should not be a political issue. Unfortunately, the left going hell-for-leather with hyperbole on these issues, pushes the right further to remove the protections that already exist. This polarisation is resulting in terrible long-term environmental outcomes.",r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOVdYMW9LbUZLLURSTG4zbGNfY3kxd3hLeDR6Q2ZkcVdSWlZpRUZ6QkdfZktGaEd0aGZINFA1NXZuVC14SFZyRGRFSDMxendvdEh2eWtqTXZmaEsyRXc9PQ==

The equator is literally bulging out, altering day length. 

'Data from satellites mapping Earth’s gravity show that since the early 1990s, the planet has become less spherical and more flattened, as ice from Greenland and Antarctica has melted and moved mass away from the poles towards the Equator. Just as a spinning ice skater slows down by extending their arms away from their body (and speeds up by pulling them in), this flow of water away from Earth’s axis of rotation slows the planet’s spin.'

"Well there’s the fact that Trump has publicly denounced project2025. And every mainstream media outlet avoided the topic hoping it would pass entirely. 

You can’t even find a clip of Biden trying to push the idea that it’s real. That should tell you something. 

You’ll also only see the most obvious far-right extremists supporting it. You don’t see an average conservative trying to push the agenda, most don’t even know it exists at all.

My BIL is the most conservative person I know and he didn’t know about it until last week when I mentioned it. He actually had to ask me to explain it to him. Then he called it ridiculous.

Also. Those furries just hacked their website and stole a bunch of documents and chat logs and yet there’s nothing coming to light that validates the possibility of it being a real concern, or connecting it to Trump at all. Hell, I could even see this thomas crooks as being an actual republican nut job who wanted project2025 to be real and when he saw Trump denounce it, it could’ve been the motive for him to do what he did, hoping to be able to free the spot up for someone who would support it.

"We have a university campus that we did some engineering work for that has an aquifer underneath it. We were utilizing it as a ground source heat pump loop. Extracting the water out of the aquifer at the top of the campus (its on a hill) running the water through various building’s heat exchanger and injecting, or attempting to inject, the water back into the aquifer down at the bottom of the campus hill. It easy to get water out of the ground, really really hard to get it back in at any reasonable rate. Even with really deep injection wells at very high pressures. Instead of going back into the rock, the water finds it way back to surface around the injection wells unless it is very slowly done, at which point you have to slow the process down so much that you can’t get a good heat transfer.

Some top layer oils, etc.  Still..... once an aquifer gets low enough, some collapse can happen and then ruin it at least in part as a holding area. Sink holes happen for reasons.

"Yes, the Tories were loud and vocal about how much they backed green initiatives, meanwhile much of our progress as a nation during the years they were in power has been *despite* their attempts to stymie and slow its growth. They made similar moves such as loudly announcing large grants for home insulation and heat pumps, but set them up with such restrictive requirements that only a tiny percentage of the funds were ever used before the programs were quietly killed. Onshore wind has been effectively banned, while applications of solar projects such as these have piled up in limbo awaiting approval.

Even so, last year we got 31.9% of our power from wind, largely huge offshore wind projects, which is greater than the 30% from fossil fuels. Meanwhile solar languishes at 4.8%. These extra projects represent an additional 10% to that solar figure, equating to an extra 0.45% of our national power being generated from solar.
 
Labour has set out a clear and believable mechanism for increasing green energy within the nation, of which this is the first concrete action. I see no reason that we shouldn't be able to hit 90% or 95% non-fossil fuel based electricity for our national grid in the coming years.

"Following Greece’s earliest heatwave in June, several Greek islands face a dire water shortage crisis. Sifnos, Leros, Sami, and parts of Crete have declared states of emergency as water supplies dwindle. Islanders are urgently calling for government intervention.

Water levels are critically low across Attica, including Athens. Naxos in the South Aegean endure a severe shortage as its main reservoir has dried up, compounded by insufficient rainfall and extreme heat.

Sparse rainfall combined with temperatures soaring up to 40°C have intensified the water crisis. Poor infrastructure and neglected desalination units aggravate the situation.

"More than a month into summer 2024, the vast majority of the U.S. population has experienced an extreme heat wave. Millions of people were under heat warnings across the western U.S. in early July or sweating through humid heat in the East.

Death Valley hit a dangerous 129 degrees Fahrenheit (53.9 C) on July 7, a day after a motorcyclist died from heat exposure there. Las Vegas broke its all-time heat record at 120 F (48.9 C). In California, a week of over 100-degree heat in large parts of the state dried out the landscape, fueling wildfires.

Extreme heat like this has been hitting countries across the planet in 2024.

Globally, each of the past 13 months has been the hottest on record for that month, including the hottest June, according to the European Union’s Copernicus climate service. The service reported on July 8, 2024, that the average temperature for the previous 12 months had also been at least 1.5 C (2.7 F) warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.

The 1.5 C warming threshold can be confusing, so let’s take a closer look at what that means. In the Paris climate agreement, countries worldwide agreed to work to keep global warming under 1.5 C, however that refers to the temperature change averaged over a 30-year period. A 30-year average is used to limit the influence of natural year-to-year fluctuations.

So far, the Earth has only crossed that threshold for a single year. However, it is still extremely concerning, and the world appears to be on track to cross the 30-year average threshold of 1.5 C within 10 years.",r/environment,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNEZ2WVhpZlpFdVphVFZZeUdFWGRKSnZHMmlWemZVMmJUaDZ5bUJudmpMMFhUQWs3RDI0Q0kzcExFdjVmWk9obV8zVWlGTWs4R1Rremc3c0cwa1JVVkE9PQ==

"It seems like the future is going to be an endless series of this type of article. Basically just elaborating the worse and worse consequences of 'global warming is real and intensifying and having ever more material impact on our way of life'.

I want to be wrong about this, but I've seen this pattern for so long already it's hard to imagine change.

Unfortunately, those in control of the patching material we have are refusing to see the hole, insisting that a little water in the bottom of a boat is normal.

"We’re largely on the same side. I’d wager we’re concerned about the same things. But to address your comment:

1) When the right wing calls Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton a far left socialist, they have no idea what they’re talking about or arguing against. Socialist has lost meaning as a word beyond “thing I think is bad”, not liking “socialism” is an easy tribal test, and calling something “socialist” (like universal healthcare) becomes a way to to instantly discredit the idea. I think that is more than just semantics and our side doing the same to “capitalist” is no better. I’m not team any particular economic theory. I’m team, do whatever we can to make people’s lives better while not sacrificing the mid and long term for the short term.

2. People are absolutely being lied to. Spotting what makes a good argument and what doesn’t is part of critical thinking skills and those are not inherent, they need to be taught. Plenty of smart people still think emotional arguments or anecdotal evidence hold weight. Plenty of smart people are unaware of the flaws in our brain’s thinking that all humans have to one degree or another (see: cognitive biases), so they have little hope of countering them. Plenty of smart people will fall for logically fallacious arguments. In short, plenty of smart people don’t know how to critically think because that is a learned skill and relatively few have had the privilege to gain a strong command of that skill.

3. We absolutely must tackle the climate crisis. I just find statements like “capitalism is killing us” to be devoid of value because the term is only vaguely understood and the solution isn’t clear. I’m far more interested in how to actually solve the problem, rather than looking for what group I can be angry at for it.

So, since we’re both concerned on the climate crisis, what solutions do you think would work? I mean, I agree that the accumulation of wealth and political power by the few is deeply concerning. I’m pissed off at fossil fuel companies as well. Throw in Wall Street’s short term focus, bankers, and anyone seeking a autocracy/theocracy into the groups I’m not happy with. But that matters not a whit unless we have actual solutions we want in place.

I read at one point that most revolutions fail because they spend too much time fighting who they don’t like, while having no idea what they actually want to implement when they gain power.

At least over ten years ago, there was a doctor who was also a financial adviser…

I’ve blocked out as much of this as I can

But he was pushing for California to raise money by taking out mortgages on some of the state-owned protected property that “no one was really using to full advantage”.  

He proposed that if California defaulted on the mortgages, then the land could come up for lease or sale again? Something like that. 

I remember reading that proposal a few times.  My mental jaw dropped. 
I couldn’t believe what I was reading. 

Then I realized that that’s where some real danger comes from;  the fact that some greedy people just keep coming back and back and back.  They’re counting on people who don’t stand to profit getting tired.

"Firstly, please stop equating GDP growth with human flourishing..

GDP grows when governments spend money on chemical weapons. Human flourishing doesn't. GDP goes down when someone quits their job with doordash to nurse a sick relative back to health. Human flourishing goes up. GDP goes up when a town has to spend money to recover from a hurricane. Human flourishing goes down. Etc.

These are 2 different things. The guy who invented GDP said explicitly that it should not be used as a measure of the success of an economy.

On the ""life has got better under capitalism so capitalism is good"" narrative, this is a faulty argument that capitalist propagandists have put out for over a century.

Firstly, don't you think there was improvement in human lives before capitalism? And don't you think there is improvement in human life outside of capitalism?

I am not a tankie but just to make the point, if you look at the GDPs (your measure) between 1920 and 1970, the USA and USSR had very similar improvements to GDP. The USSR started from abject poverty so it never caught up but it made the same progress.

The argument is a fallacy - it's called ""post hoc ergo proctor hoc"". Something that happened after a first thing happened *because* of that first thing.

In fact, the place where it is appropriate to specifically point to capitalism as the cause is the rampant growth in inequality and the widespread destruction of the environment. Why? Because these consequences are built into the logic of capitalism.

By dividing people into 2 classes, one of which extracts wealth from the other, it's inevitable that we end up with rampant inequality. And because the supreme goal of every capitalist enterprise is to generate profits at any cost, then it's inevitable that the environment will bear the costs of the enterprise's activity whenever that can create profits (either by over-extraction or by excessive pollution).

There are alternative systems that can mitigate these mechanisms because they take into account the interests of the people being affected by those potential negative impacts, not as an afterthought but inherently in the decision-making processes.

Honestly, capitalism is not a system that deserves your loyalty. And btw I say this as someone who employs 35 people in 2 countries. I have no immediate material interest in making these arguments. I can just see that this system has run out of road and I want my kids and grandkids to have a good life.
