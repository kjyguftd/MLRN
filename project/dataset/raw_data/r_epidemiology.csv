"It's pretty rare and the incubation period is extremely long, meaning you're likely to get sparse answers from observational studies. Someone could handle meat and get sick a year or ten years later - what would you ask them? Maybe you could look to see if a case had ever been documented in someone who had been vegetarian for their entire life, which would be suggestive of an alternative mode of exposure to straight up eating meat. That brings to mind the outbreak of a pig tapeworm in an Orthodox Jewish community who don't eat pork, which had been brought in by a sick domestic worker - the fact that the Jewish people don't eat meat ruled that out as the way they acquired the infection. 

Prion diseases were first discovered AFAIK in Papua New Guinea among people who practiced a very specific form of endocannibalism - specific members of the family would ritualistically imbibe tissue from the decedents nervous system. It took an anthropologist to solve the decades-long outbreak IIRC, and was the first time prion diseases (Kuru, in this case) were described.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNERjltZTdRbWVlVUVjUnVlaXlpNFRVOWxteGl0dGYxWGVmOGZYT3BpSkZkeGpZWWYyT1J6VTV4QWNkc2hSLTVUY0xxczRsNWFqMFBvQmQtZzFsQlh2VlE9PQ==

"I think it's also important to contextualize the transmission of a pathogen via fomites as well, though. 

When we typically describe transmission of a pathogen via fomites, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease or adenovirus, it is usually in a way that suggests more casual contact - think exposure via contaminated surfaces like sheets, countertops, shared towels/clothing, doorknobs, etc. 

I can't really think of any reasonable scenarios where these objects would have prions on them (someone please let me know if they can, though!) *Edited to add that they CAN and DO persist on surfaces, but prions getting onto surfaces via casual contact seems unlikely and in studies that demonstrate they can persist on surfaces the prions are intentionally applied to these surfaces or studied in environments they're already on such as in soil contaminated by prions by deer with CWD.

Additionally, These are not adequate reservoirs for prion infection as 1. People are not ingesting them, and 2. These are not objects that are coming into contact with the central nervous system in the way that optho/neuro surgical instruments do in cases in which these contaminated instruments have been the source of infection.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQV9jWmxSYTBOY21hMGpxQ1M3N2hpMS1IQllDOGhGT0hfamd0bVBvbXVJT2JpQldNekNfc3ZHQS01YTFOcHVwUW1VUFN6ZVQxeTNwM0JLMmNQdDhuQU41d1poN1V0T1NjQVRJaEFDLTRIRlE9

"Valuable read, thanks! I was concerned in spaces within and immediately outside of labs or theatres that handle human CNS tissue, say a training facility for surgeons or something.

"Well... Kind of. Depends on what you mean by persist. Prions are proteins, so you can't kill them, and they won't just ""disappear"". As I mentioned before, you can fully cook a piece of meat with CJD prions and still get the disease. So they are resilient to some things that kill or deactivate other infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, parasites).

There are different types of evidence in researching health phenomena. ""Basic research"" or ""bench research"" is what you're talking about. Looking at how things work at a cellular level, in the lab. Epidemiologists don't usually do microbiology, although some have an education in that subject. We tend to look more at patterns and linkages in disease status among humans in the real world. Like I said, if you were to diagnose CJD in someone who had been vegan their entire life, then that would be evidence that you can get a prion disorder without directly consuming infected meat. I don't know if any evidence of this type exists out there, but it's an example of what you would look for.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZUdISC12b0NDUjlBYzZtSDRBOXNacnJ6MVBNQ1dvVDhtSmZ0TjY0ZVl2aVhydjJ5R1JGY2c0Umc0V1B0RHNaYl9MeGd5cXlWNUpzLVZ3dFZmam1HdkE9PQ==
"A lot of the intro jobs seem to want at least 3 years of epi or data analysis experience (sometimes professional experience plus the degree is an allowed substitute). I don't like it but that seems to be the way it is for a lot of positions.

I will say it's great you already work for a health department. Is there a way you can do an internal transfer to a new position, maybe reach out to the epi department directly or use a work contact? Having an in or knowing someone will really set you above outside applicants.

Other than that if you want a semi introductory experience to data analysis/research have you looked into research assistant positions (at lots of hospitals and medical research orgs) or clinical research positions (clinical research coordinator is a good entry level post but you may not like it if you don't like any of the admin side of running studies).

It can be challenging, Good luck!",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbjdwZ2lQQktQVk84d2FXR2dvNUdJMHhBcGFnY09SNkZxNXhKaXR1cHl5QXYtdE9ieFJYS05Td0ZGaTJjMjFvVnVicnJodFluUzNzcDZfLWxlZ1J1S3VLQWtadlZoRTdlY3R0Z1hUbU44WFE9
"I found this page on prion infection control to be helpful in thinking about this question:

According to UCSF there have been no known cases related to occupational exposure, so theoretically it seems unlikely. I'd think we'd likely see higher numbers associated with Healthcare workers who are exposed to infective tissue if this were a more viable transmission route. This may also be a good question for a microbiologist as they'd have more information on the biological factors whereas as epidemiologist we are looking more at relationships between exposures and diseases.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEMTNmNG9OdlJrRzR6ZzhvUXB6Q0ZXbDNXYnptbHRKb1FZaWFWblgxVERvRnhpWldhcGs3eVA0RTRzZTZQYk42WlBuS191UENFYW55a3UzWjVMWi1FcUtjZW44ZHl1RHIxM19mb1BCQUpWWFU9

"At this time, these have not been demonstrated to be modes of transmission in humans as far as I'm aware. Tissue outside the central nervous system has a much lower concentration of prions. The study that showed that skin from those who died from CJD could cause infection in humanized mice used direct inoculation into the brain of the mice, and it took twice as long for the mice to become infected vs the mice that were inoculated with the same patient's brain tissue. This was a very invasive procedure (directly into the brain), so it does not demonstrate infection happens from casual contact with an infected individual. 

Of course there is a lot about prions that remains unknown, but I'd imagine we'd see higher case counts in humans if these were efficient modes of transmission.

"I am approaching the end of my PhD and I received a few offers in the US. My dream has always been of investigating the environmental/chemical risk factors of cancer but for my PhD I had not found fundings for that area. A couple of these postdoc offers are indeed within this field of research and in big federal institutions. But I am not totally sure about either the position itself or the location. The others are in different fields (still environmental exposures but different clinical outcomes). I was wondering whether it would be difficult (I plan to come back to Europe for something like a faculty position somewhere in Spain) to then find a position or even create my own research line in cancer epidemiology. Another thing to consider is that at least in Spain (and that's one of the reasons I am moving to the US for 2/3 years), research in the environmental determinants of cancer is not that developed yet, so not lots of data to work with.

"It is a bit of an apple and bananas comparison mostly because alcohol is framed as an individual risk while access to clean water tends to be viewed as more of a community risk. Because of this published stats for access to clean water tend to focus on mortality rates by area or country or looking at population attributable risk (% of deaths to to the exposure). The [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-burden-of-disease)  has a bunch of data on this if you are interested. 


I think the mechanism between these is also going to be somewhat different too-- most alcohol deaths are going to be long term exposure versus acute events (overdoses, alcohol related accidents) while for unsafe drinking water is more about risk of acute disease outbreak where everything seems fine until vibrio cholera gets into your water supply and then you get an outbreak thatl sickens/kills a large number of people in short order.  


Another good comparison that is pretty well studies may be smoking risk. This is an [older cohort study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10218754/) from a bunch of countries with lengthy follow-up that found a 30% (<10 cigs/day) or 80% (>10 cigs per day) increased risk of all cause mortality for smokers compared with never smokers.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQSmVjUVFpdDFJWjlUOWZMbl9GWm5lSEY2WC15MFVxY2dnTzZ0MG1HS1pkaXZvdnZiSWNvWHJSUFkxeFpmSWs0ZXItZWdqd1JQY0k1dEQ0bTZ0U2NNcUE9PQ==

"I am a postdoc in environmental epi currently exploring job opportunities. Initially, I considered transitioning to the industry, particularly in RWE-related work in health tech, research consulting, and pharmaceutical companies. However, likely due to the layoffs this year, it has not been successful. Although the technical skills and methods I use are highly transferable, the gap in subject matter and lack of actual industry experience are not negligible, so I understand the lack of responses.

While some aspects of academia are appealing, things like the uncertainty regarding grants, relocating to where the schools are, and teaching responsibilities are not something I am passionate about.

"Hi everyone

I am nearly ready to submit apps for online MPH Epi programs (UML, SUNY Downstate, possibly CUNY SPH) but am getting cold feet due to uncertainty about the practicum requirement. I'm located in CA and work for the state government though not at a health-related agency. I seek to be an environmental epidemiologist in the long run so I've communicated with agencies of interest about potential placements for students with full-time work schedules. However, their internships/practicum assignments require work during typical business hours which has discouraged me. I've also talked to admissions but I'm still uncertain about landing a practicum placement that works with my schedule as I know networking and skills are imperative.

I'm thinking about forgoing this app cycle and waiting until next year to apply to other programs. I decided late to go through with grad school and also couldn't find a third recommendation letter writer so my options are limited. I did my undergrad in Statistics so I can use the extra time to refresh my knowledge and work on personal projects to improve my applications and prep to possibly apply to Biostat programs.

Tldr; Does anyone have success stories to share about completing practicums as an online out-of-state student? Also might wait until next year to apply so I can be eligible for funding, have more options, and be a stronger applicant.",r/epidemiology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXd2NuTFQ3T3RXQ0tUTXQ1MThCX1FVM3A2elFqS3hYMTZ0QjI1Z2JlTHh6TUtYNmJtWUE2VDF5RHFvTzJUTnduSEhHRVhGTG4xLW5HVGpxMjhoLVZfbkE9PQ==
