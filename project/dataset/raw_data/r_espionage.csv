They are naturally gay cats. This is not a Western invention. I had no idea when I adopted them but there's not much to be done because even though Cannoli does not seem to like it she refuses to be separated and starves herself if separated. 

The people who ran the place where I adopted them were extremely mentally ill likening themselves to some of the cats, evil and sickening, so maybe whoever gave them up were protecting them from them. I don't know the backstory so I try to not assume the lore, you know what I mean.

"I dont think anyone will argue that homosexuality hasnt always existed for as long as people have existed. Thats not the point. The point is that the idea of a ""gay person"" as an identity which can be derived as distinct from straight, is very much a new and western thing.

In the same way that the concept of a white race, is basically as old as the age of colonialism, starting roughly 500 years ago when Columbus found the so-called new world. No one is arguing that white people didnt exist before, only that the identity as such became defined around that time.

Gay people and gay rights are absolutely being used in the service of imperialism today, not unlike feminism. Whenever the west wants to bad mouth a middle eastern regime, like let's say the Taliban, they say ""they don't let them go to school, etc etc."" I'm not saying I agree with that, but Putin's point (and moreso Alexander Dugin's point, who is the real originator of these ideas within Russia), is simply saying that states must be left to develop in their own way and at their own pace. Saying that you (the west) reserve the right to invade and destroy countries because they dont align with your values is peak imperialist chauvinism, especially when you don't criticize other states which also break these values, but allow you to profit from their resources, such as Saudi Arabia for example.

"I think better internal security in terms of limiting more stringently and tracking actively access to files or information, levels of access to same being better secured, better onboarding and in-company clearancing which would probably require training by specialists in intelligence.
