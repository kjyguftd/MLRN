"Rule of thumb: anyone who DMs you is trying to scam you.

There are lots of bridges available between networks and other L2s. There are lots of dapps you can use. Scammers will send you authentic looking fake dapps that will give them control of your wallet and the funds in it.

You basically need to bridge eth from the eth network onto the arbitrum L2. I think bridge.arbitrum.io is the way I would go about just to get eth there onto that network.

"> Congrats? There’s plenty of examples of technologies that took a while to get adoption, there’s also plenty of examples of technologies that never got that adoption after several years.

Perhaps, BUT you can't cite a single example of any eventually-adopted technology that took 15+ YEARS before anybody could explain precisely WTF it does that's better than what we're already using.

Even from the invention of the lightbulb, combustion engine or the Internet, what those technologies offered were clearly better than what we had.  They may have required infrastructure before they became  ubiqutous, but everybody saw their benefits from day one.

The same cannot be said for crypto.  There's not a single thing crypto & blockchain tech does that's better than what we've already been using for decades.  Smart contracts?  LOL.  Databases have had stored procedures for decades - that's nothing new and in the real world, they're much more powerful and flexible than what Eth's tiny little ecosystem supports.

"this question is old but still totally relevant and since none of these comments give a good answer, i will give you one:

You have several avenues you can pursue and it depends on if you're trying to find a price through code of doing it manually. If you're not trying to do it through code, you can go to the chainlink website and see if they have a deployed price feed for the token you want to price. If they do, call that contract directly with the function latestAnswer() at whatever block you want. For example, you can send an HTTP POST request to your full node with data like this: 

{""id"":1,""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""eth\\_call"",""params"":\\[{""data"":""0x50d25bcd"",""to"":""0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419""},""0x1223140""\\]}

That represents calling the chainlink ETH/USD contract (0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419) and invoking method ""latestAnswer()"" (0x50d25bcd) at block 19018047 (0x1223140). 

  
The problem is more difficult if you're doing it through code and therefore don't know what coins you'll have to price and can't go searching chainlink for oracles. In that case, the easiest is to find a deployed price oracle that will give a price feed on any coin. For example, the YFI oracle is deployed at address

    0x83d95e0d5f402511db06817aff3f9ea88224b030

and to get a price back you encode your function call as 

    ""0x482ba306000000000000000000000000"" + coinOfInterestContractAddress

(don't forget to strip the ""0x"" from the address of the coin before concatenating into the function encoding)



Another example, the 1inch spot price aggregators:

    0x07d91f5fb9bf7798734c3f606db065549f6893bb

    0x52cbe0f49ccdd4dc6e9c13bab024eabd2842045b

    0x0addd25a91563696d8567df78d5a01c9a991f9b8

  
1 inch has deployed 3 and you should use whichever one was most recently deployed before the block at which you need to know a token value. The function encoding for the 1 inch SPAs is 

    ""0x7de4fd10000000000000000000000000"" + coinOfInterestContractAddress +
                           ""0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001""

Look at the documentation for both of these if you want to use them because one returns price in eth and one returns price in USD. There are also many other price oracles already deployed on the blockchain, but you'll have to google around to find them.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZnliZEpCUnVsam5velhqT1VsNkViMXEtY082cldGZU9Wblk2dlVyRHpFLU5WZEFFRm5GTHNBMXp2cmJHcWFtUG9fTTh2ZHJzZ3NJRzllVDRIVEx1MmU1R08tQmU2WTVMSWVWbFh4QVJRUUk9
You can use hardhat and simulate mainnet and not bother with testnet. Testnet is good for the preliminary final results to make sure things work on the actual chain but testing using mainnet is my preferable way. This way you can test against all other working smart contracts on chain and simulate wallets.,r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUkpaMXJ2RnlOSlNVbWs1eFZZS0lGa2JNYVlMdzFNMUQ0SGdSYm9Hak5YbXdENy1tWGc3VEtxdlZoajQzb282MVRsUkpxTmt6ZFk1b0Rkb1FBdFZERVE9PQ==

"I just ran into this on my Linux notebook. IDK what language my seed phrase is in. I speak English, but the seed is probably Spanish or Portuguese. I noticed it wasn't English when it was originally created, but didn't care at the time.

 I put my seed into the iancoog website and got results for Spanish and Portuguese. I'm not clear on what to do next. Any help would be appreciated.

FYI, I have some dust i the wallet, but the main asset is a small bag of  DragonChain (DRGN).

I have Metamask installed in my browser on my notebook, but can install another wallet if necessary. I also have an Android phone if tihat helps. I prefer not to do any crypto on my phone, but a one-time thing is fine.

"What does this have to do with /Ethereum? This is a /Robinhood customer support issue.

Robinhood rightfully can't just access their wallets willy nilly. It probably requires dozens of people to sign off on a multisig at once, first in a test environment then again in prod. FYI if they do offer to help you it will come with a $300-500+ USD fee, seeing that's what other CEXs all charge for recovery.

>I looked up if anyone else owns an ETH wallet with the same address as my ETC wallet and nothing came up. 

The wallet addresses for any 'Ethereum Virtual Machine' blockchain are the same, eg ETH ETC BSC so on, you can deposit ETH into an ETC wallet address and vice versa. If you sent 'EVM' coins to a Robinhood 'EVM' address they are currently in custody of it. RH will still need to manually import their ETC private key into an ETH wallet to access it though.

Suppose you sent coins to the wrong address by mistake (even 1 letter off), or to a non-EVM address, then no one would own the address since that would be statistically impossible. There are more possible addresses than there are atoms in the visible universe and every one of them is 'valid'. Searching for who owns some 'random inactive address' is moot. Luckily for you ETH and ETC are both EVM chains, so there is still some chance at recovery in the future. 

Never rush a cryptocurrency transaction, they are not reversable. Always send a small test amount first as an insurance policy if you're ever even a little unsure, once the >$0.05 lands then repeat the exact process using the full amount. Probably wise not to use RH either for numerous reasons just IMO.

Hopefully you didn't lose much. You'll have to chalk it up as a textbook/learning fee, unfortunately.

Keep stringent records (your transaction ID, wallet address, address deposited into, date and time, RH account information) for when Robinhood eventually does offer a recovery service. If it is a substantial amount you may need to pursue litigation to force their hand.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTa0c3aXhvQjZCWS1jVWZ6Y0hDMmktc3FaS0xWZG5saERuVG0yUFp2dmJJNloyTzV3SlhyWFdqeEV6MVdzN3AzZFNZY1BGVFZ3S3cxenY5b3hmMy1DMkE9PQ==

"Sorry if I came off as brash. I've made a lion's share of absent minded mistakes with crypto myself. Losing money by your own hand is like getting kicked in the pants twice..

Robinhood is notoriously bad for retail so it doesn't surprise me they won't offer even the most basic of support. It took them what, a year? to enable withdraws after they 'supported' cryptocurrencies in the first place. I don't know how it's legal for them to knowingly hold onto others property with zero recourse to the owner, but they're in bed with big money so common rules seem to not apply to them. :/

I highly recommend using crypto-native CEXs whenever dealing with cryptocurrencies. Kraken has the best support, Coinbase has mediocre support but a better user experience. Whichever is most regulated in your country if not the US, so in case shit hits the fan you have some recourse.

"There is chatter that the SEC is reversing their position on Ethereum Spot ETF approval.

"Yes, it should go through if the gas price goes down to 6.85 gwei. I don't know when this will happen though, 6.85 gwei is very low. There's an extra complication in that the gas for a transaction is comprised of 2 parts, the ""base fee"" and the ""tip"" or the ""priority fee"". If the tip is very low it's possible that miners won't include the transaction even if the base fee is low enough.

In theory your transaction can float around indefinitely until the gas price goes low enough at which point it will complete, although if not even a single node continues to relay it around the network it may effectively disappear, as if you'd never sent it.

If you want to speed it up you can send another transaction with the same serial number (""nonce""). The wallet will usually label this something like ""speed up"".

Be aware that if you send another transaction with a higher nonce, that will also be queued behind the current one, as the nonces must be processed in order. If you want to forget about the current transaction and make a different one, the wallet will normally allow you to set the nonce manually to be the same as the current unconfirmed one. This will replace the unconfirmed one if its gas fee is higher.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSlViY1FYVmtCZzJGUUVIWVpQd1QyZ1dHRk9pZ01VZDdobGJ1bWZuZEY1RUNhdjdINzNuMG5RMXBDRTdjVl95S1I5cWpQdVM1TlA0YmUydHViN1EzLXc9PQ==

The price of ether has jumped more than 16 per cent on speculation that US regulators will give the green light to stock market funds that invest in the world’s second-biggest cryptocurrency.

The sharp rise, which began last night, caught many traders by surprise as most had expected the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay or reject the first ether exchange-traded fund by a Thursday deadline. Bitcoin also rose 6 per cent overnight to just over $71,000.

The renewed pressure on the SEC comes after the agency in January gave approval to exchange traded funds that invest bitcoin, giving way after years of delays. The spot bitcoin ETFs have drawn more than $10bn into funds run by assets managers such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Ark Investment Management, and helped fuel bitcoin’s rise to a record high of more than $73,000 in March.

Ether hit a six-week high of $3,700 after several media reports said issuers had been asked by the SEC to file amended applications for their spot ether ETFs.

“Given the radio silence and lack of [SEC] engagement on the filings, consensus was that an ether exchange traded fund would be denied,” said Gautaum Chhugani, an analyst at Bernstein.

The first decisions, on funds run by VanEck and Ark Investment Management, are due on Thursday and Friday respectively.

But analysts said this first stage of the approval process might not mean investors could shortly start trading the funds. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, a financial adviser, said on social media site X that the SEC had no deadline to sign off the second, final stage.

Chhugani said the political dynamics around crypto in Washington were shifting, after 18 months of regulatory crackdowns and Democrat-led blocks to regulation.

He noted that former president Donald Trump had hosted an event for crypto enthusiasts and last week Congress agreed to overturn a controversial accounting rule that penalised banks wanting to hold digital assets for customers.

“All of these, in our view, have likely caused a last-minute change of heart in the incumbent administration, perhaps realising the anti-crypto stance may turn out to have a political cost,” he said.

Ether is the cryptocurrency linked to the ethereum blockchain, which is widely used as the platform for building new cryptocurrency projects. Its technology can hold assets and enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts.

Several other asset managers also have filed applications with the SEC for ETFs that invest directly in ether, including Fidelity and BlackRock.

Geoff Kendrick, an analyst at Standard Chartered, said he expected the price of ether to rise to $8,000 by the end of the year as “once investors realise ETH is the ‘big tech’ of digital assets they are likely to embrace it”.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUeHc3bzJHYTk2VXp6WHdoNWFGMDBHRWdXcFJ2WXhQSXFsZzRNcUlyZzZ4bjZMR1JCYzBzQzFheldUQnhhZ1JKODBQWmdRbTg4NWZpRFk2N3lSRld4SVE9PQ==

"ETH's code complexity is a tradeoff, not inherently a flaw.

Before ETH, there were a bunch of different blockchains springing up for super-specific purposes. You had BTC for transferring value, Namecoin for a DNS-registry type thing, Monero for private transactions, and a handful of others for various purposes. Each of these blockchains were fairly simple, but they had significant challenges.

First and foremost, every blockchain had to draw enough hashing power to provide meaningful security. A chain with small amounts of hashing power could easily be overpowered by an attacker. And different chains would be splitting the overall hashing power, so chains would have to compete for miners to make sure their chain was adequately secured. This made it hard to get any decent ecosystem of chains with decent security while each chain served a small, specialized purpose.

Having small, special purpose chains also makes interoperability difficult. If you wanted to trade BTC for a Namecoin domain, you could do an atomic swap, but you had to get both parties to the transaction online at the same time to negotiate the trade. There's no way to just set up a purely on-chain offer that anybody can take for the right price.

Ethereum solves a lot of these problems, with the trade-off being code complexity. Ethereum gives us one blockchain to secure (initially with hashing power, later with PoS), rather than a bunch of chains that need to be independently secured. Anyone can write their own smart contract (or system of smart contracts) that are secured by Ethereum, without having to develop their own blockchain client and figure out how to attract enough miners to their cause to provide meaningful security. And smart contracts can make calls to each other trivially, avoiding complexity like atomic swaps that complicate interactions between systems.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUeFBOU3FUWHBnYm5yS3VwMmVHdHgtbFZ4Y2IzN1A4V0gydjVvZW13YjhOTG5jeVdBTTRtd2hzaU8yYWx3WUJOWURRb21QYUVLa1BGMkRwajFGZ1AzQ1ZLVHluM3BnekZnZC1Qdmc4SlZYUkE9

"I've worked a little bit in Go-Ethereum, and to me it seems like a lot of unnecessary complexity has been added very recently. I first considered using older versions, but now using recent ones for now. The problem isn't the codebase, it's that the protocol itself has been changed. And probably not in a good way. Part of it is the chase after scalability. Ethereum was a revolutionary technology. It was already a complete product, but still wanted to turn itself into some kind of sharded parallelized system. So then you have the ""Dank Sharding"" thing, that as far as I know could run as a separate service using state channels (thus add zero complexity to the Ethereum protocol and node codebase), but instead it is being built-in to the protocol and validators/miners are made to participate in it. Then you have to add a second transaction type, and you need to generalize an interface for transaction types, and with enough similar (and unnecessary as in the protocol would work without it) changes, you get a lot of complexity. The whole EIP system too, with changes constantly, means you have codebases that account for all changes, and when (at what block or time) they happened, and then you get a lot more complexity that is not really necessary if the system was planned out from the start, but have to be added when you change it on the fly. That I don't think is too much of a problem, it's more things like ""Dank Sharding"" that is destroying the codebase and protocol I think.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUSG5wd1FQZjllQjZHaFQ1bVIyYkVwS0Z3OGdQWTBzZW5ZX1lpc3RsNmx1eWJvZ1praGsxQUdHal9YWmFvaG5IaDBDM2hobl9QTXJteGdWcTFSVW5GdlE9PQ==
"Solo staking is not a security because you're using/risking your own capital and doing the work of validating and running a node yourself. On the other end of the spectrum, Coinbase offering to take your money and stake it for you for a fee could very well constitute an investment contract that could easily be considered a security — The investment contract itself would be the security, not ""Staked ETH"" as an asset.

But that'd be assuming a world with sensible regulations and guidelines, where Coinbase would simply have to follow the currently inexistant process to register with the SEC to continue offering their staking services. In such a world, an ETH ETF that stakes its eth under management would be inevitable.

">What makes me a little sad is that only the etf approval has been capable to create demand for ETH

It's not as much the ETF approval (which hasn't even happened), as it is clear regulatory certainty on the horizon (ie the ""Fit21"" bill).

The accounting rules for holding crypto as a company were/are plainly fucked. If you have $100 of ETH on your balance sheet your company was worth +100, if that ETH dropped to $50 your company was worth +50, then if ETH went up to $200 your company was still worth +50. If you're holding somebody else's $100 in ETH instead you had to offset it as a liability with $100 in cash, meaning you can't spend that cash to grow as you would otherwise. This isn't the greatest 'look' when you're trying to appease investors, the liability to simply interact with crypto wasn't worth the effort.

NO company wants the DOJ/SEC going after them, especially one that's gone public. Reddit was ready and willing to issue cryptocurrencies in place of 'karma' on their platform, but necessarily had to kill the project due to regulatory uncertainty.

NO sane person wants to invest with that much overhang. Suppose there was a chance the US government imposed an 80% tax on all ETH activities or outright sanctioned them (as they've proposed in the past), then it's not worth the risk. 

The current rules effectively halted innovation (ie private investment) in the US where innovation typically thrives. The ETF is secondary to those rules being appended, IMO. I mean, crypto startups were moving to Central-Europe to launch lol, the US has definitely screwed the pooch when that's the case.

The saddest part is, a lot of funding have gravitated towards building projects with no long term sustainability but optimize for maximum liquidity extraction within the four year cycle. This is why all the focus has been on extracting liquidity from airdrop farming.

In the end, most just exited and the chart look absolutely decimated lol. Worst of all, ppl were bragging about the easy money on CT - no one was posting their “creative content”. 

When the predominant narrative is to PvP against newcomers and boomers, ETF is the biggest kick on it. You can see from a lot of CT ETH KOLers. All of a sudden they stopped talking about crypto vision and now they just gravitate to induce maximal FOMO to front run “boomers”.

ETH issuance has nothing to do with gas fees. ETH price doesn't even have anything to do with gas fees.

Blockspace fees aka gas fees are simply how much people are willing to pay to get into the next block. Say if there's lots of opportunities to make $3 by doing a transaction, the market will pay up to $2.99 for inclusion. ETH could be $100M per coin and people would still only pay $2.99 for inclusion in that case.

>At the same time, higher ETH price means high security budget which in a lot of cases a waste of budget.

""waste of budget"" is why people are considering reducing the issuance curve in the first place. Ethereum's whole schtick is 'minimum viable issuance' which is why issuance was reduced from 13500 per day to ~2500 per day going from POW to POS. Issuance could have stayed at 13500 but as you say yourself it'd have been a waste. If the price goes astronomical (which it has since the original POS issuance spec) issuance can safely be reduced even further.

Issuance is just used to incentivize people to build and validate blocks honestly. It doesn't serve any other purpose.

Why not L2? The Ethereum roadmap is named ""A L2 Centric Ethereum"". It will be many years before the L1 scales even a little bit, and by then L2's will have scaled over 100x more.

"I'm sorry, your English is not the best and I'm an idiot. I still might not understand.

Issuance has nothing to do with gas fees. These are all very seperate issues to be worked on, and they are all being worked on in parallel by different people. Each problem requires totally different solutions.

People are working on expanding L1 capacity now. Once 66.67% of validators manually agree to it, the Ethereum gas limit (block size) will increase by 33%. But most people don't manually do anything.. This might happen during the next Ethereum upgrade, because the 33% increase will be the default in their updated validator software unless they manually opt-out for some reason. https://pumpthegas.org/

Every time the gas limit is increased, always, people just end up making more transactions. The term is called 'induced demand', where an increase of supply naturally leads to an increase of demand... The gas limit could increase by 100x tomorrow and still have zero effect on gas fees because people (and bots) will just make 100x the amount of transactions.

Induced demand is why L2's are the best solution for scaling. L2's are the result of many years of trial and error and research. Increasing the L1 blocksize again and again will only lead to centralization (once only large data centers can maintain the blockchain) yet still doing nothing to reduce end-user fees. Scaling the L1 is a trap. So many other blockchains (the so called ETH killers) have shut down permanently or become irrelevant because of this very appealing trap. While it doesn't matter if an L2 is run on a data center or even if it goes offline, because your assets always stay inside of the L1.

The Verge is being worked on right now too, it basically compresses all the data going onto L1. It might be a few years out now. Ethereum can process around 15 transactions per second today. After the Verge maybe 1500 or 4500 transactions per second. But, by then L2's will be able to process 100,000 or more transactions per second, so most people will still be using L2's regardless. Today L2's can already process over 1500-4500 transactions per second for reference.

"The US always does everything wrong at first, then on long enough time scales it rights itself eventually. If enough citizens want for the US to embrace crypto then politicians will have to embrace crypto. That's just democracy, whether it's sincere or not they still have to appease the people (or else someone different will).

I think politicians thought 'crypto is dead' more than a few times, so it was never important enough to take the time and learn about it. But it just keeps bouncing back, it's proven itself to be something truly resilient, so their hand is being forced now for good and worse.

It seems to me a lot of politicans have become very educated on (and pro) crypto in the last couple years, from the tons of people that call them each day to explain what matters to them personally. Not as many young (under 60) people take the time to contact their representitives, but that seems to be changing, and ignorance never leads us anywhere pleasant. There is a generational divide in this space for sure.

https://www.standwithcrypto.org/politicians

Europe and Asia have done a ton of work in the last few years differentiating scams/securities/commodities in the crypto space. Rules for how to launch a centralized security and decentralize into a commodity, rules for stablecoins, rules for precisely what is and isn't allowed with investors. Meanwhile, the US greenlit investors to pour into FTX's hundred billion dollar fraud exchange that was based on an Excel spreadsheet, and allowed Craig Wright and Richard Hart to scam more billions from US citizens on securities fraud also without oversight.. or even a slap on the wrist.

Allowing investors to be defrauded repeatedly is not the best look for the Democrat-lead SEC right now...during an election year. SEC's job foremost is consumer protection and they have completely failed. There are obviously a shitload of single-issue voters holding heavy crypto bags, and even more who lost (or may lose) money solely due to seemingly personal issues within the SEC, such as if they wrongly classed ETH as a security.

It really sucks this had to become political but should at least serve to steer the ship in the right direction. The US has really fumbled the ball hard and so I hope they over-compensate (by doing things right, creating regulations that still make sense 30 years from now that enables innovation) to regain some of their lost ground. If the US fails to embrace crypto, innovation will move off-shore, and if this crypto thing turns out to be huge there's no getting it back. By now the politicians should all know that risk.

The swaps work regardless of whether the Uniswap Lab exists or not. Yes, you will probably have to use a new front end. Effectively, the Uniswap protocol can function independently of regulation.

What do you mean, ""the turn goes to shit""? Even if the token goes to shit, Uniswap Lab earns multi millions per month from their frontend fees. They get to keep all of it and don't need to distribute to UNI holders. They have money to do what they are working on independent of the token price.

"Bro 

Convert eth to XMR using a defi service
Break your XMR up into several different wallets 
Start swapping back to ETH again for each wallet holding XMR.
Mind you that if we’re talking big sums, then having different ETH wallets might be a wise idea.
Send the ETH chunks to different exchanges using L2 solutions, pile it all up there and send it to a fresh wallet, and pray you don’t get tagged by said exchanges. If needed, swap the ETH into XMR again, break it down into different wallets then offload it using a defi service into a freshly made wallet.

Not 100% bullet proof obviously 🙄 

Another way would be to convert ETH into XMR then use a p2p platform to trade the XMR into BTC and then swap the BTC into ETH.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVRkhxYWRfOUtKaWw0ZzJvcnRndjFnZkdGMm9iNk1SWXpUOWQ2V1IxN2dHT3UySmxUSzNoQk9qZE93ZGNkLW14dEZ0RTZFTWd2Y0haVTVLSG1hM2gzRnhTaFBEM29BYl90TWhla2ZOZ3hoa2s9

Even if you somehow leveraged xrm and you were able to get away with a ""clean"" exit and make it disappear.

But when we compare the launch of the gold ETF and Bitcoin ETF. The gold ETF is actually a tiny little launch 😂 

Bitcoin got waaaaay more money into the ETF in a few months than gold did when it launched. Which means the growth should be even better for Bitcoin long term. 

In terms of ETH we will have to wait and see how much money is flowing I to it in the first few months to see a comparison.

"If Ethereum become a global infrastructure that everyone uses. The entire network should be worth 80 trillion. However, the value might not be in the ETH token. It could very well be in a stablecoin or even wrapped BTC.

ETH token has privilege of lowest gas usage, the downside is its issuance has to comply with security requirement. If the security requirement needs ETH to have a 0.5% inflation (before burn), it has to.

The privilege of low gas is very strong, and no matter it is inflationary or deflationary, it will reach equilibrium after a few decades. So it is reasonable to assume ETH will be the dominant currency in the Ethereum network.

A 50% dominance over the 80 trillion Ethereum network value gives ETH a 40 trillion market cap. Assume the equilibrium supply is 100 million ETH (because we know 120 million lead to deflation).

">you are assuming (based on the simplest of mathematics) that the total marketcap of crypto will go from $2.6 Trillion to $35 Trillion

Based on the simplest of mathematics, Bitcoin will cull itself from its algorithmic security-budget halvings and ETH dominance will rise substantially from where it rests today. I honestly think it's wrong to assume a 7% ETH dominance into the future.

If crypto's total market cap is valued at $10T and ETH holds 50% dominance, with 100M coins, it would be valued at $5T or $50,000 per coin.

Say 100M coins from 30 years of 0.5% deflation. $10T is just around 3x from the ATH, and $5T is around 1.5x Microsoft's - without accounting for inflation. If accounting for 2.5% inflation, $50K would be 1.38x crypto's ATH and ETH valued at 0.69x of today's Microsoft valuation, after 30 years.

In 30 years BTC's security budget will be 1.75 BTC issued per day to cover all POW expenses, to back up my first statement. I don't think BTC is going to $20M per coin to compensate, which is a 256x increase, and then 2x again in 3.5 years when the budget drops to 0.875 per day. If BTC somehow did that and ETH went up a meager 128x lagging far behind it, then one ETH would be valued at around $500,000 instead.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWWHQxcDYzN0FyREN4cTY1SVRiM3l0RHNUVzl0bzVXNDBwTHZNR25MSzh5a0R6MTBwSUZvRmZERHhjMnNEaWY5T1VxVkVQeU9abG1aSzBtMkg0eTdOcEE9PQ==

">If Ethereum become a global infrastructure that everyone uses. 

I agree.

>However, the value might not be in the ETH token. It could very well be in a stablecoin or even wrapped BTC.

But since ETH is the currency to use this network, it will capture the value of these uses.

ETH is a commodity required to operate in this ecosystem (I'm not saying it's a commodity asset, it's just an analogy), pretty much like oil is a commodity to operate in the shipping industry. It's the raw material that the network uses and that every business will actually need (directly or not) to operate on this ""platform"".

With L2 / L3 development, even if end users will be able to pay fees with stablecoins, the settlement will happen on the Ethereum layer with ETH. All infrastructure operators (L2 and L3) will need ETH to process transactions on the user's behalf.
Gas sponsoring is just an abstraction, it doesn't remove the value of ETH.

So the average user will probably not even know about ETH, but ETH will be everywhere to make this work.

ETH is not like wBTC, stablecoins or any other token on Ethereum. **ETH is not an Ethereum use case, it is the fuel for every Ethereum use case to work.**

>ETH token has privilege of lowest gas usage

"> It's better at keeping any immutable record.

Not by any meaningful metric.  A log file with cryptographic signing that is posted to multiple places is probably more reliable, and it doesn't help money launderers and human traffickers.

>Every other technology requires a trusted custodian.

This is another myth, that blockchain doesn't require middlemen and trust.  in fact, quite the contrary.  Instead of known middlemen that can be held accountable (such as centralized authorities, government and well-regulated corporations) you guys instead replace them with random, anonymous people and coders who are under no obligation whatsoever to be moral or ethical - they're exclusively motivated by their own selfish material interests.  I'd say believing the latter group is more reliable requires tremendously more trust.

>Do you want irrefutable proof that a photo or video existed at a specific time and have been manipulated since? 

Look up, ""The Oracle Problem.""   Blockchain is only as reliable as the humans who submit data onto that system.  Blockchain itself isn't the mechanism of trust.

This is a great example of how you've fabricated a problem you claim blockchain solves (somebody modifying data after it's been written to a database) which is not a problem anybody ever actually deals with.  If you have trusted Oracles, then the method of data storage is irrelevant.

>Blockchain does immutability better than any other technology in existence.

No it doesn't.  it's slower and more resource intensive than thousands of older, better technology that can do the same thing.

And the big problem with blockchain is: *tokenization*.   Your desire to decentralize the database means that the database is only as dependable as the solid value of the tokens around which its ecosystem depends.  So if ETH or BTC at any point in the future, no longer becomes desirable and stops going up in price (which is a mathematical **inevitability**) then there's no longer much motivation to operate the blockchain, then **your ""world's best immutable database"" ceases to exist.**",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWOWV0UHpLWF90c3RhRi1DdVVKNFp6S1c2OHZLYmtRc0NTUTg4SVhHd0hmVFlHQXNmSl9NcGVlYmhidl96bjZyV1l2YXBCNExnbUYyRG5UY1Q2dkE1M3c9PQ==

">A log file with cryptographic signing that is posted to multiple places is probably more reliable. 

Ooohhh, yeah, I hadn't thought of that. Like, I guess if you had encrypted information distributed in multiple places like some kind of distributed ledger that would be fuckin reliable. 

Shit. Got me there.

No one is inherently trustworthy. There are only incentives and systems. Say I kept my log with 3 corporations. What prevents them from changing it? Sure... Maybe legal troubles if they get caught, but how would they get caught? It's your word against theirs, unless.... Unless they don't all change. They're caught off there isn't consensus. Blockchain validators have a strong financial incentive to be in consensus. Congrats. You now finally understand literally the very first thing about blockchain. Just now. For the first time.

But on tokenization, it absolutely does not require that the line keeps going up. It only requires that the token has value. The block chain requires validation, and that validation is incentivized with rewards. There's absolutely no requirement that those rewards increase over time. You just misunderstood Dan Olson, who unfortunately misunderstands blockchain. I was subscribed to folding ideas long before that video though, so I can deal with a few undercooked takes.

The speculative value of cryptocurrency depends on growth. Just as the speculative value of Tesla or Apple, or Nvidia, or Ford, or AT&T or Gold depend on the line going up. That speculative value is the main draw for investors now, though staking in ether effectively creates a dividend which replaces some of that. But even now, the value in blockchain isn't purely speculative.

Here's one thing his video misses. You, also, in an emotional sense, have a position. If you have chosen not to invest in cryptocurrency, that's a position. You succeed relative to your peers (capitalism is inherently competitive) if cryptocurrency fails. You fail relative to your peers if cryptocurrency succeeds. If you're honest with yourself, you must see this reality.

I also have a position. I bought my first ether at $12. I'm considering selling soon to purchase a house outright. That doesn't mean I'm right and you're wrong. But it does mean that if someone in this conversation would be seeking vindication for their opinion, it wouldn't be me.

And what else? Quite the gish gallop you dropped. 

The Oracle problem is only a program in a subset of problems. For example, it's not a problem I'm the use cases I already have in my last comment. 

Proving that a video hasn't been manipulated since a given datetime is completely useful, for say, dashcams. 

We know when the crash occurred. We know the video hasn't been edited since then if it was hashed to the block chain. The only other possibility is that the video was fabricated before the crash, which just really wouldn't apply in nearly all traffic incidents. This might not seem important to you now, but AI video is still improving at a breakneck pace. 

No Oracle problem. See? 

Maybe you should approach this topic with more curiosity.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWWGpHTXlGTDBBdlNCLXoyWEVGSlkxdldBNkF3Nl82b0U0R3hacXFCQzU0b1dPLWpkNS0xWi1KWGFKNndUQTZ0Y2ItNzI2OWxOb1hhYk1wSmVQZGc5OFE9PQ==

"I'm running a Rocket Pool validator and let me tell you - honestly, it's desperate work.

I've yielded around 6% total since I began.. which is over 60% above the market average, basically meaning I won the lottery. What happened was in my first few weeks validating, using Flashbots MEV relay during a crazy bout of congestion, I managed to score a 2 ETH block. Then in the last 12+ months my validator haven't gotten a single proposal, so I've yielded 0 ETH since then. There's about an equal chance I could have yielded 0% this entire time instead of the 2 ETH, seeing as LOTS and lots of validators still haven't gotten their first proposal, or else have maybe netted 0.5% by opting out of MEV. Considering I needed RPL exposure to run my validator, I've *maybe* just hardly broken even on costs after all this time.

In short, if I get another proposal you better bet I'm not planning on screwing with the block myself and instead taking the max-profit option offered to me..

Gas bids are public information, at least for now. If there's a $5000 opportunity somewhere to be had and I bid even $4000 in gas to somehow front-run it, MEV searchers and others will bid $4001 and the validator will ignore my transaction due to their own incentive to achieve maximum profit - actually more likely, the MEV searcher will find a creative way to include both of our transactions, so I end up paying $4000 and they still manage to take the $5000 arb from me (which is my experience doing DEX arbs on my own, even with paltry $20 amounts). 

Flashbots has ~50 dedicated MEV searchers working for them using extremely specialized systems. They will always, every time, be able to outdo whatever opportunities I could manage to find on my own. I am not going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars per year simulating 5 blocks every minute, all so for my 12 seconds of fame I'm prepared well enough to find the $5000 needle in the haystack. It wouldn't make sense economically even if I was running 1000 validators by myself, even individual Lido operators with 1% of the total ETH stake (~10,000 validators) are using MEV relays.

There is only something like 8 or 10 MEV relays that people use. If it was easy work, there would be thousands to choose from the way there are tens of thousands of RPC nodes to pick out of. If one MEV relay's historical average is even 0.05% higher than another, no one will use that other one, and with fewer people the less funding it has to get any better. It is a vicious competition.

Centralized MEV relays are actually a huge issue with Ethereum/Solana, and any other active blockchain people pay to use now or in the future. Ethereum plans to remove some of the MEV relay's power by enshrining this emergent ""proposer-builder seperation"" directly into the core protocol, so no block builder orders their own blocks but also no proposer has the ability to freely censor (and some do), but the underlying mechanics will always persist.

Any money wasted on searching for MEV would be better spent on rETH or ETH just IMHO. But idk maybe you get lucky or find some novel approach no one's thought of before.

"Normally I'd say DCA is king except there's only a few months left to frontrun the institutions, then after that nadda and no one will have that chance ever again. So, I dunno.. Lump sum makes more sense to me right now, but also made a shitload more sense a year ago.. There's substantially more risk of losses the higher the price goes.

If you're investing IMO not a bad idea keep a long term time horizon in mind. Like 5-10 years before thinking of selling anything, unless by chance you hit your targets early. With that in mind you should be ok regardless what the day to day volitility brings. Like, yeah you could've made more if you timed the bottom perfectly or DCAd through a black swan crash, but if you're up 10-20x in the end anyway you can't be that mad.

If you have a 6-12 month horizon instead, and you're down 15K again in 12 months, odds are you'll just sell the bottom again lol. Investing rewards patience, trading is a whole other beast.

Crypto is a game of risk management, long term the fundamentals are on your side, short term not one person knows shit about fuck. Learn how to set up trailing stop losses and shit like that. At least try to eliminate the risk of losing 50% ever again, and learn to lock in profits, before you fall for the same mistakes.

Don't construe anything I said as financial advice. I don't want to be blamed when you lose money :P No one except you even knows what your financial situation is. If you have 18 months of expenses saved and your 401k is maxed, and you have a boat to sell if shit hits the fan, 30K isn't the same to you as if that's your entire life savings that took 50 years to come up with and you're living hand to mouth.

"Learning tokenomics and how to build an ERC-20 token on Ethereum involves a mix of understanding economic principles, blockchain technology, and practical coding skills. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Step 1: Understanding Tokenomics

1. **Basic Economics and Finance:**
   - Study the fundamentals of economics, focusing on supply and demand, market dynamics, and monetary policy.
   - Learn about finance, especially topics like investment, market behavior, and asset valuation.

2. **Cryptocurrency Fundamentals:**
   - Read about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies to understand the basic principles.
   - Study the differences between various types of tokens (utility tokens, security tokens, stablecoins, etc.).

3. **Token Economics (Tokenomics):**
   - Learn how tokens are used within ecosystems to incentivize behavior, reward users, and govern platforms.
   - Explore case studies of successful tokens to see how their economic models are designed and implemented.
   - Key concepts to study include token supply, distribution, utility, governance, and economic incentives.

### Step 2: Learning Blockchain Basics

1. **Blockchain Technology:**
   - Understand how blockchain works, including concepts like decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts.
   - Study Ethereum specifically, as it is the most popular platform for creating ERC-20 tokens.

2. **Smart Contracts:**
   - Learn what smart contracts are and how they function on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Study Solidity, the programming language used for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.

### Step 3: Practical Steps to Building an ERC-20 Token

1. **Setting Up the Development Environment:**
   - Install and set up Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
   - Install Truffle, a popular Ethereum development framework.
   - Install Ganache, a personal Ethereum blockchain for testing.

2. **Writing the ERC-20 Smart Contract:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the ERC-20 token standard by reading its specification.
   - Use Solidity to write a basic ERC-20 token smart contract. You can start with a template and modify it as needed.

   Example of a simple ERC-20 token contract:

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   import ""@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"";

   contract MyToken is ERC20 {
       constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20(""MyToken"", ""MTK"") {
           _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Testing the Smart Contract:**
   - Write test scripts using JavaScript and Mocha (a testing framework) to ensure your smart contract functions correctly.
   - Deploy and test your contract on the Ganache blockchain.

4. **Deploying the Smart Contract:**
   - Once tested, deploy your smart contract to the Ethereum mainnet or a testnet (like Rinkeby or Ropsten) using Truffle or Hardhat.

5. **Interacting with Your Token:**
   - Use tools like Remix (an online Solidity IDE) and MetaMask (a browser extension wallet) to interact with your deployed contract.
   - Develop a frontend if needed, using web3.js or ethers.js to enable users to interact with your token through a web interface.

### Step 4: Learning Resources

1. **Online Courses:**
   - Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX offer courses on blockchain, Ethereum, and smart contracts.
   - Specific courses on Solidity and tokenomics can be found on these platforms.

2. **Documentation and Tutorials:**
   - The official Ethereum and Solidity documentation.
   - OpenZeppelin documentation for secure smart contract templates.

"Price is Ratio. And concentrated LP ratio is relative to the range. Yes price can't go back without you getting the other token back because the thing changing price is the ratio of assets in the range /LP. Just think of an LP as you putting both assets up for sale, if they take one they give you the other, hence a swap. The more they take the less they get, as they trade at the new rate, ie the price is higher as the ratio is.

If theres 100 usdt in a pool with 100 matic, 1 matic = 
1 usdt. People arbitrate to match prices to elsewhere. 

You set your range to concentrate your assets more in rational prices, so they get traded more and earn you more fees. If its outside your price range, do you think price will return? If not, with draw and sell some to make a better range. You have more of one token than when you started as you effectively sold one for increasingly More of the other up to the top price in your range incrementally.

Of course you get the other token back if price changes as people giving it back to take the other back from you is how price changes. You want fees to out earn the decline in your asset value.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkQzhMNlNiejk4S2FtWlY3WjRLT1VBTERrcjNna3RYZUFRM252LV9BMld0dVB4c3Q4UHdINk5acF9uX3h0TGpvVWZHVTNnRjVmLUZOR3Z5ZVJiM3U0WEE9PQ==

4. Wait until there is sell/buy traction and when the moment is right, sell everything you had. Of course you, as the owner of the token have the most of it.

"Would you prefer more optimistic protocols??

Optimistic rollups assume/hope everything is valid, and give users a 7 day delay on withdraw to contest problems. Instead of prove everything is valid using ZK straight from the getgo...

Even *the* Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) will be replaced by a ZKEVM once the tech is robust and battle tested. Even Optimism is going ZK despite its Optimistic-sounding name.

ZK tech is as much of a breakthrough as blockchains themselves, even off-chain protocols secured by ZK can be as secure and trustless as on-chain. ZK is the future.

>So, I'm wondering if we need that many atm!!

"First there are two main types of zk proofs, zk-stark and zk-snark, and secondly there are many ways to integrate zk standards into a given protocol whether that protocol is something to do with ethereum, an L2, or whatever. The different ways of doing things are all an opportunity to experiment and look for different results, and tinker to develop different methods that are variously more user friendly, more secure, faster, cheaper fees, etc. None of these things come for free so there has to be a balance and discovery of what the market wants the most.

Also, the different platforms have a different degree of EVM compatibility. Some are fully compatible which is a plus but tend to have weaknesses like being slower. Others are less compatible which is a weakness because it takes effort to port an EVM app to them, but they tend to have other strengths like being faster. From a software development perspective, each of these different methods provide a different platform and different use cases for dApp developers to try different things, so each zk project is promoting themselves and trying to attract dApp developers and eventually come out on top.

In the end it's all healthy competition and good because many people are trying many different things.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkTm9zOWNhY0ZiRDh5ZDQ5cWwwU3B2YnBwRVhPQXhlZmRfUm14SWU5OEJvdkhsTkczWGZFbGo0LXFNRExBTXpzV29IM2VuT2RzZWNtMUVONHM1TEtMWFE9PQ==

"Contrary to this post PoS does not lead to increased centralization nor to the rich get richer. This is just bad math, the OP does not understand how percentages work. Here is a very simple example with the math laid out clearly. Assume we have 2 validators in the network; the first one owns 90% of the network, the second one owns 10%. Lets call them Whale and Shrimpy, respectively.

To make the numbers round let's assume total circulating supply of ETH is 100 initially and that the yield resulting from being a validator is 10% per year. After the first year, 10 new ETH will have been minted. Whale would have gotten 9 ETH, and Shrimpy would have gotten 1 ETH. OP is assuming that as 9 is bigger than 1, Whale is getting richer faster than Shrimpy. But, let's look at the final situation globally.

At year 0:

Total ETH circulating supply: 100 ETH

Whale has 90 ETH. Owns 90% of the network.

Shrimpy has 10 ETH. Owns 10% of the network.


At year 1:

Total ETH circulating supply: 110 ETH

Whale has 99 ETH. Owns 90% of the network.

Shrimpy has 11 ETH. Owns 10% of the network.

Whale has exactly the same network ownership after validating for 1 whole year, the network is not centralizing at all!

">Why Did You Choose Ethereum?

I didn't. It simply became the defacto biggest alive crypto. The bitcoin protocol died/ossified around the time of the blocksize ""debates"". That's when I realized it had no long term survival chance. Just a matter of time before it collapses in on itself. And Ethereum was simply the second biggest that wasn't afraid to keep innovating. All other crypto's were consistently compared to Ethereum, it had to justify why it wasn't just building on top of Ethereum. Some coins just looked away or didn't mention their differences. Others did mention their reasoning behind why not Ethereum and I've always found them flawed/baseless or just pure marketing bullshit. At this point, the networking effect of Ethereum is too big to ever be overcome.

Wow... so you don't understand AI either, huh?  All AI can do is re-arrange data that it's been fed.  It has no capacity to determine truth.  

As far as decentralization... here you go...


#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #1 (Decentralized)

**""It's decentralized!!!""** / **""Crypto gives the control of money back to the people""** / **""Crypto is 'trustless'""**

1. Just because you de-centralize something doesn't mean it's better.  And this is especially true in the case of crypto.  The case for decentralized crypto is based on a phony notion that central authorities can't do anything right, which flies in the face of the thousands of things you use each and every day that ""inept central government"" does for you.  Do you like electricity?  Internet?  Owning your own home and car?  Roads and highways?  Thank the government.

2. Decentralizing things, especially in the context of crypto [simply creates additional problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=1157s).  In the de-centralized world of crypto ""code is law"" which means there's nobody actually held accountable for things going wrong. And when they do, you're fucked.

3. In the real world, everybody prefers to deal with entities they know and trust - they don't want ""trustless transactions"" - they want reliable authorities who are held accountable for things.  Would you rather eat at a restaurant that has been regularly inspected by the health department, or some back-alley vendor selling meat from the trunk of his car?

4. You still aren't avoiding ""middlemen"", ""authorities"" or ""third parties"" using crypto. In fact quite the opposite: You need third parties to convert crypto into fiat and vice-versa; you depend on third parties who write and audit all the code you use to process your transactions; you depend on third parties to operate the network; you depend on ""middlemen"" to provide all the uilities and infrastructure upon which crypto depends.

5.  If you look into any crypto project, you will ultimately find [it's not actually decentralized at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s).",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQ0g0eXZnVXVEMVB6cW1reVVhT2U4VVZ5UGZ4SlZpR0VGMF80TzVOWUZKMjFiR1pGUDJUVDVJbXBGRlVYU1dYcU9OdENKN3FvOHVGd0RTY01rTXVxS2c9PQ==

The ideal state of things for any cryptocurrency is for Layer 1 to reach a state of maturity and ""ossification"", where it is extremely difficult to change via both malicious tampering *and* well-intentioned social consensus (which can be subject to human misjudgement, mistakes, popular common delusions, and the madness of crowds).  It provides just enough minimum capability to enable more diverse functionality on Layer 2 and higher.  Once it achieves that, the rate of change to Layer 1 needs to slow to a crawl or stop, with a high bar for further modifications.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJldWRmRXVMbThra0FVdDZncVJiU05OY2ZLa2NfSTV0bG52c2dITHJXTFJhMDkzZkd4ODRPOUplVy1YU3R4bXZocmExSTBOTm9DbUY4YW9fbldhS2pYWEE9PQ==

">International wire transfers? 5 seconds instead of 3-5 business days?

That's totally false.  Here's [evidence proving the claim is false.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=4118s).

So.. are you going to acknowledge you're wrong?  I doubt it.

Also, even if sending crypto were to equal sending ""money"" (which it isn't), this notion that an ETH transaction will go through in 5 seconds shows you don't even understand how your own network actually works.   The average ETH block time is 12 seconds, and that assumes you pay a high enough fee to get included in the current block instead of sitting around in the mempool.  So even when you make up phony claims, your data is flawed.

That's more about the number of validators than the amount of ETH you have, but I think there's a little confusion/confirmation bias around this stat. It's important to know that the _rate of return_ is the same for every validator _on average_.

"1. The tech.

>The tech.

I chose Ethereum because of the tech. I know, I know it's so cliche, but for me it's true. I listen to all of the developer calls each Thursday. I follow the developers on X and I read all that they have to say. It took several years for me to gain a background in what the heck they were talking about, but once I did, I don't have any doubts about this project.

Ethereum has an ambitious roadmap and the developers deliver.

>The community

I read a lot of things on Reddit, and I've not seen a better community in terms of noobs being able to ask questions and people being able to hold differing opinions from the norm without being called names or being banned. I couldn't say positive things about other projects on most other coin specific subs.

"What issuers, custodians, etc can do in an ETF is strongly regulated. If the ETH can't be staked it won't be staked. ETFs are very strongly regulated, they make tons of money in volume, not by cheating regulations.

The whale and shrimpy argument is highlighting something very important that you should think carefully about. Centralization occurs due to two factors primarily, barriers of entry and economies of scale.

Barriers of entry are the fixed costs to participate. For example, when your bank tells you we cannot give you access to this very nice product because you are not an accredited investor. That's a barrier of entry. It keeps Shrimpy from being able to play the adults game where big bucks are made. 

Economies of scale define the shape of the returns as your scale increases. When you are so big that you can negotiate energy contracts in bulk at low prices that's an economy of scale. Economies of scale make it so Whale wins harder and harder as he becomes bigger. 

Ethereum has a barrier of entry in the form of 32 ETH, that's the minimum amount required for a validator and the cost of a consumer grade PC. But liquid staking protocols get away with this requirement, effectively reducing it to nothing. And it has almost non-existent economies of scale, specially if you use a pool for MEV. By design, the curve of rewards is extremely flat and anyone can participate.

In PoW, you need to buy costly specialized HW. And your returns are highly dependent on your energy costs for which you have significant economies of scale.

"Small players in a pos system are more nimble than larger actors and will therefore be able to take advantage of new opertuneties earlier and gain an outsized return. A single person handling his own money moves faster than a billion dollar firm handling customer funds. The larger players will also more often than not use earnings to pay for operational costs, while smaller players will more likely use paychecks from an employer instead. A larger player will also have a much larger operational cost since they need staff to operate the business, while the smaller player is likely a single person. Transaction fees are one operational cost that will eat away some of the advantages for very small players, so a player with, say, a couple of Eth won't outperform a player with 10k Eth unless the transaction fees are very low.

With proof of work, small players do not have that kind of first mover advantage. They also don't have access to the kinds of deals and partnerships that the larger miners have access to. Take, for example, the miner inn I believe it was Texas that was paid by the power company to turn their miners off in certain periods, that deal significantly reduced the cost per bitcoin mined for the miner. That kind of deal simply isn't available to small miners which means that in the long term they wont be able to mine bitcoin profitably, since larger miners taking advantage of these kinds of deals will push the hashrate up increasing the base cost of mining  bitcoin up to a point that is unreachable by small miners.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlTlZncUhXbmUxcDExRjBVQkl0MGl1RkxBUUMzNHJ1NGJ0Unh3NW1lbkUzVE83WFhpVXhXSno2aVVicVREQi0zTUt0dFFyT3A3VlpRWmJxSDdXRUdzVmc9PQ==
"Staking requires effort to set up node, proper internet connection, and keeping up to date with current events to ensure nodes are up to date. The equipment required is also non-trivial for staking. Bigger stakers may enjoy some more economies of scale, but they also bear some more risk as they can be penalized more if their setup breaks and are unable to attest for the network. You need to actively monitor your staking rig, so it's hardly a passive income.

You should go and read up on the staking mechanisms of Ethereum. Researchers are also actively finding ways to encourage more decentralized setups that may make it more difficult for big stakers to enjoy economies of scale compared to solo stakers.

The centralizing power of ethereum staking is much lower than the centralizing power and economies of scale of bitcoin mining. With the halving and unclear path towards a sustainable miner revenue in the future, only the most efficient ASICs, and people with the cheapest electricity can mine bitcoin. Eventually it will be come so centralized that governments can easily find these mining farms and control or shut them down if they'd like to. Sure, other miners will come in to fill the void, but the network will already be easily disrupted.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZ2tJektDM09uR2J3cWNYcFl6RUVVNDY4R01HX0pOd2E0NVNpcWU0YVZpaTRQRk1wc1UzNjdQaHFBTXNVbTZaZ1U5a2JEV055N2hZaW1jSzVIN1NPd3c9PQ==

I just pointed out you blocked him. I wasn't involved in the discussion.

>As of right now there are more than 75,000+ transactions pending to be processed.  So most transactions will take significantly more than 12 seconds unless they pay a very high fee.

You are correct. With an avg of one block every 12s, the avg time to confirm an Eth transaction would *only* be 6s in ideal conditions without a dynamic backlog in the mempool, and uniformly timed transaction submissions, and direct confirmation by the validators, but this doesn't happen in practice. Since there is a backlog in the mempool and transactions are not processed instantaneously upon arrival, as you rightly pointed out, most users will experience longer wait times depending on the gas price they are willing to pay and network congestion.

Further, there are dangers to going too far equating ETH and BTC. Different architecture, different direction, different usecases, etc.

I think it is tempting to equate at the moment because they are both being used as stores of wealth/speculative vehicles. I fully expect a divergent evolution going forward as education and awareness of crypto exponentially grows. So perhaps my original post conflated the two accidentally.



Interesting thought exercise. Do you think Bitcoin would have survived till mid 2015 as a POS blockchain? 6.5 long years. The time when ETH was born. Perhaps we should extend this to 13 years and use ETHs switch to POS.

We could take this thought experiment further and consider that its not 6.5 years we should count 13 years using 

A related question - what role did the power use argument of POW play in Ethereum’s choice for POS? Have you noticed that the reality of the kind of power usage POW exploits is finally blunted the truly ridiculous end of world prophecies from the powers that have the most to lose from crypto’s success, many of which have come and gone without even coming close to the mark.

I have thought hard about POS and a smart contract blockchain. I am not completely sure (nobody can be) that POW would be ideal either. Executing complex financial operations is not what Bitcoin was meant to do I believe. I also believe that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be siblings in a new financial architecture, both occupying their own niches.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmYm5lekNsSEFnVGxtSU1CZHdqTDJUZW03YmZVcWJadnBvTG9EN21EbmQ3VWdueDI5Wi1SWGtJdTU1dnFGekREU3IwWFdjd3doLUxTOFhyMkdvN1JTWmc9PQ==

"Huge props to you man. First thing’s first: Don’t discredit any of the work you’ve done here so far. “Yay kinda” is unfair to where you’re at. It should be just “yay”. 

I’m going to let you in on a little secret: half (sometimes all, unfortunately) of the battle is in who you know. The other half, is what you’ve got so far - a strong proof of concept. 

Instead of thinking “CEO” here, think “co-founder”. You just need someone who has talent on the other side of the aisle. Many web3 start up schools require their applicants to have one technical founder and one ‘business’ founder for this very reason. 

Let me warn you though - who you decide to stack your chips with is very potentially going to make or break what you’ve got, so try really really hard to vet your applicants. 

Can’t promise I’ll respond but if you have any specific questions feel free to try and DM me. Biggest pitfall though is what I already included above: who you decide to work with is either going to be the greatest or worst decision your business has ever made.

You’re going to make mistakes - and that’s okay. Just learn from them as you go, and always do things with wholehearted purpose. Trying to do four separate things half-heartedly will result ‘failure’ 98% of the time.

"I am sure you all have heard the argument from the Bitcoin Maxis that ETH is totally centralized due to Proof of Stake, and how Bitcoin is unique and special because anyone can do it.

Of course that’s poppycock, because you need to buy a hugely expensive specialized mining rig to get into Bitcoin mining, and the rig will be obsolete in a year or two. And there is a near monopoly on the manufacture of the miners.

Now we learn that the manufacturer has spent years selling intentionally crippled hardware to the rest of the world, while keeping all the fully-functional hardware for themselves. Meanwhile they appear to be running a bunch of miners under different names to hide their ownership.

I’m not going to say Bitcoin has been irrevocably corrupted by the hardware manufacturers.

"The entire model is conducive to centralization, there's no way around it.

Mining corporations drive up the difficulty, so smaller miners sell their operations or just stop. This leads to more control by those same few mining corporations, who then continue driving up the difficulty (no one can compete with them). Each Bitcoin halving leads to smaller miners exiting the game as well. Those mining operations who are the smallest at any given time, know very well that they'll sell sooner or later, as the difficulty increases.

It's a vicious cycle, and there's really no escape from it. Give it 10 years, and all of Bitcoin's mining will be done by just a few global corporations. Maxis are utterly delusional cultists.

"> Every miner doing shenanigans can be excluded by the nodes, essentially blocking them from contributing to the chain, making the miners hardware useless

This is impossible. The miner can just change their address and then it's impossible to know it was the malicious block builder, you can't just block a single miners hardware. The only way would be changing the mining algorithm altogether, which would invalidate *all* miners hardware

It is impossible to stop a malicious miner from mining, this is a very well known downside to proof of work. This works in proof of stake because they have literal stake, whereas miners don't

> Also, how are you supposed to have control over the network, if you don‘t control the rules of said network? You‘re contradicting yourself with that statement.

"Hey -- circling back to this since I finally figured this out.

Figment let's you have 100% of Consensus Layer rewards -- eg attestations. 

If you propose a block, figment is going to take **some** percentage of the Execution Layer rewards.  From my own analysis it seems to be 40%, but their site says 30%.  So there is some discrepancy I'm trying to better understand.

Rather than directly get MEV rewards from block builders, it goes through a splitter contract which takes the Execution Layer reward and splits it three ways.

I decompiled the contract and ran it through GPT4 just to understand the byte code

* Payee 1 is You (≈ 60.50% of the MEV)
* Payee 2 is Figment (≈ 11.73%) -- 0xa1e3b3a77cf01cda4c5c20f88705c7512ceee1af
* Payee 3 is Figment (≈ 27.78%) -- 0xed488e6cc4b030eb5bfdde3227c3d5da2b9040e8

Reviewing the contract more closely it looks like an authorized agent can set the split values. So Figment could change how much they take from the EL rewards.

Looking on Etherscan, Figment reuses this splitter contract a lot, the same bytecode is associated with 511 other accounts.

So I take this to understand that Figment is has 511 ""clients"" running any number of validators where they are taking ~40% of all the MEV.

They're printing money.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZUJJWnQwZ2NuVTJ3RllnR3UwRE5zdjVGcmdhLXlmOGp1QTZaaTZYVEtxSGlJeHRnc0U5Mm9hbDlKN29laHNIVTh3aEUwakZ4SVJhWEFIZHMwU2o4OWc9PQ==

"There are 2 main settings involving gas, the gas limit and the gas price. 

The gas limit is the maximum gas you're prepared to use. Think of it like ""to drive from home to work, I need 3 litres of gas"". If you set too low a gas limit, your transaction will fail because you'll run out of gas before you reach your destination. 

The gas price is how much you're pay to buy the gas, like ""I will pay up to $2 per litre for gas"". The cost of gas varies from block to block. If you set this too low, it won't get in a block for a long time of ever. Since your transaction is getting in a block, even if it's failing, you're already spending enough so you can stop futzing with that.

Usually the wallet will deal with estimating the gas limit so you don't need to worry about it, but there are some weird cases where it may get it wrong. The simple way to handle this that will probably work for you here (although ymmv) is to look at the block explorer for that address, look at the transactions that actually get through, and use the settings they're using. Looking at the successful transactions for the address you're sending to I see that the successful ones are setting the limit at `25,054`, or setting it higher (eg `50,000`) but only using `25,054`. Whereas the failing transactions which I guess are yours are only set at `23,716`.

So try setting the limit to `25,054`, or if you intend to leave some ETH in the sender address anyhow then just set something a bit higher like `50,000` just in case; It won't cost you anything to set a higher limit as it will only charge you want you use, but you need to have enough ETH in the account to pay for the maximum you set.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuQ0JNX0xiRHIyd3JZaWl4Y1ZWVXpNSnJCUFdwSFQtS1VkQjJ0MzJyTzEzQ0ZjM1ZkZ1hBSk9xWWxXVkFiUmxvbFg5QkNKVVdnSzdFTUhYMDBjd21oRnc9PQ==

"> So in other words, the Max Fee expressed in Gwei is the price per litre of gas

Right. 1 gwei is an amount of money, specifically 1 billionth of an ETH. (""Gwei"" is short for ""giga-wei"": The smallest possible unit of ETH is called `wei`, which is 1 billionth of a gwei, so there are a billion billion wei to an ETH.)

> and the gas limit is the total amount in willling to spend to get the Trx in a block?

Close, the gas limit expressed in units of gas, so it's more like the maximum numbers of litres you're willing to buy.

So if you used (rounding down the example for easier sums) `25,000 units of gas` at `11 gwei per unit`, the total cost would be `(25,000 * 11)` = `275,000 gwei`.

"Bitcoin is close to it's all time high. But the halving just happened and even though it reached all time high past cycles over the last 15 years after the halving. The price goes back to the all time high and does an increase in multiples. What the multiple this time will be is anyone's guess. 

Me personally I think it goes between 140-200k 

So that is a 2-3x the last cycles all time high

69k X 2-3

Those multiples are lower than other cycles. Cause there seems to be diminishing returns. 

If you take the averages of what has happened after 18months after the halving in the last 2 cycles it has gone up by like 18x and I think the last cycle it went up by 7.8X 


The average of those 2 puts it around 500k to 1 million 18months after the halving. I think it will be much lower 140k-200k to be honest.

 Either way bitcoins isn't going anywhere. If U do buy be ready to hold ur position for 4 years if you can't do that and need the money earlier than rethink this through. The last thing U want to do is buy high and sell low. If it does drop after U buy just keep working and keep buying more until the next cycle. U HAVE TO!! wait until the next halving where the supply of new Bitcoins rewards gets reduced again. Which puts pressure on the price cause there is less on the market usually. And U can recover ur money and most likely a bunch of profits. 

The US government has approved the giant financial institutions to sell Bitcoin ETFS. they have an incentive to hire people to go out there and sell these new etfs cause they have service fees from managing it. So just an educated guess I think the price will go up over the next 10 years. 

As for ETH it usually follows Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes up so does ETH. ETH hasn't hit it's last all time high yet. 

The ETH ETF hasn't launched yet either. So I think it will increase by a bunch still. My estimate if Bitcoin gets to the lower range 140k or so. I think ETH goes to 8-10k maybe a bit more. 

Buying the ETH ETF is a bit weird cause if you buy real eth you can ""stake"" it and get between 3-4% in ETH so ur growing ur ETH amount. That was one of the things the SEC said the ETF companies can't do with ETH is stake it and do the payouts or keep the payouts. 

And it makes sense that they did that to be honest. When you stake your ETH you lock it up for a bit of time. 

If you don't know about ETH staking you should learn about it before U do anything like staking. Cause there are scammers out there. You have to do it with reputable services particularly decentralized ones. 

I think the most reputable one that is run by an actual company is Coinbase if I'm not mistaken. But they are centralised. I think a good decentralized one is called lido. 

You really gotta do research on this. But ya it's a way to grow the amount of eth you have by helping to secure the network. 
And it's practically free. You can't do that with Bitcoin. 


If you want to take care of your own Bitcoin and eth then buy it yourself and self custody it. Buy in exchange and then take it out of the exchange to your crypto cold storage wallet Learn about that process. 

If you don't want that responsibility then the ETF works fine but ur gonna pay management fees. It also goes against the ethos of crypto where you don't need anyone to hold your money for U. U take care if yourself. But U gotta be careful don't lose the keys don't use random software that can steal it. Get a cold storage wallet. You gotta do research bro. 

If U wanna buy some and be responsible for it ur self before setting up cold wallet and before the price goes up like crazy then use a reputable exchange. Like Coinbase. Those guys aren't going anywhere and have never scammed anyone. As a matter of fact Coinbase hold the Bitcoins that the ETF companies buy lol. That's how much these guys are trusted. 

Good luck and welcome to crypto. It will definitely change ur life if ur smart and patient about it :)",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuZFlBMkNiZm9EZGQ4NXJ2UFN6MTIxOWdESjE2TlhDQVN1WEstTFV2d0x2dElwRm0tMlZXbmdxOHhmVGsyTXdpOTExdnM1QVAweUJheTNLaDQwVFpkM1E9PQ==

"Bitcoin staking brings several benefits to the DeFi ecosystem:

1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: Increases liquidity by allowing users to lock their Bitcoin in DeFi protocols.
2. **Yield Generation**: Enables Bitcoin holders to earn rewards, generating passive income.
3. **Network Security**: Staking contributes to the security and stability of DeFi networks.
4. **Adoption Boost**: Encourages wider adoption of Bitcoin within the DeFi space, integrating traditional crypto with DeFi.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuUVIwbzAxc2lkSXdxeDZXQnBNWi03ZzNPdFRJSlJ6ODN5UXpBUEUxY3lWeGlhVUJUWVptZ2hVNGU2T3drcTRZcmpZOUFnU0pLb1NCTTUwT0Eyc0pEb0E9PQ==

It's like the gas in your car.

Your ETH 'car' consumes computational resources.. just called ""gas"" for short.

Gas limit, the setting in your wallet, is the amount of fuel in your tank that you're taking on your trip. Typically you should never adjust this.

Current gas prices are based on how much congestion there is at the pump, rather, the roads. The more demand there is for gas the higher the cost, and vice versa.

Your map, ie smart contract, should have an estimate for how much gas you need. Your car, ie wallet, will default to this when making a transaction.

Rarely, but sometimes the estimate is wrong. You can look at how much gas other people have consumed to make the same transaction on Etherscan for reference. To send ETH to another ETH wallet consumes 21,000 gas, to use smart contracts requires more based on their size/complexity and how much of the network's node storage space is needed.

If you increase the limit by too much, eg set it to 50,000 but you only need 30,000 gas, you will be refunded the difference. If you decrease the limit by too much, eg set it to 30,000 but need 50,000, you will pay the 30,000 because there's no way for the car (block builder) to know you didn't have enough gas before they did all the work.

Like needing 10L of gas and running out halfway, you still consumed that gas regardless if you made it to your destination. Or needing 10L of gas and consuming 5L, you still have 5L left.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuaW1GTDJNRTB6MDVaT0xaX0stMjJVMVpNRC1iNV9ORWQySEMweW1uWEVDLWNzdWptS05KOVREbTNZMHZZdTlxUjBvUV9nWEtIbkRmRDdubjFkYWFkRmc9PQ==

So if there is a drop in price to trigger the trailing stop you might not get your order filled because slippage or liquidity issues.

I do use Jupiter which is also very fast but when things are moving fast orders might not get filled.  
As DEXes improve constantly and liquidity is improving, you could have them coming soon with DEX aggregators but speed must improve.

I am guessing that with Solana Firedancer Jupiter might get this for first.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvM3RsUEZ1VmRuRVZ1RE11cF80TjV0cGJEQ0pESDlYcFBwNHpCRV92MFFYX0luQUFDQnUtenJIV21scXNoNVZablp6OWdPSks0QzU4d19Bb09JQnJfUXc9PQ==

That will reduce the load on the network, which I guess may allow a modest increase in the maximum gas per block, but I wouldn't get your hopes up that it will make a noticeable difference to user gas fees.

">Why would Ethereum ""needs to ossify""? What benefit does it gain from stopping further work done to it?

The idea is rooted in the desire to achieve stability and security. Here are the main reasons why Ethereum might benefit from ossifying:

**Security and Reliability:** A stable, unchanging protocol can be more secure because it reduces the attack surface. Each change or upgrade introduces potential vulnerabilities. By freezing the protocol, developers and users can have greater confidence in its security and reliability.

**Network Stability:** Frequent upgrades and changes can cause disruptions and require nodes to update software continuously. This can lead to temporary network instability and make it difficult for developers to build on a moving target. Ossification can provide a stable foundation for applications and services.

**Decentralization:** A more stable and unchanging protocol can enhance decentralization. When frequent upgrades are required, it often leads to centralization of decision-making among core developers or influential stakeholders. Ossification can reduce the influence of centralized entities on the network's direction.

**Long-Term Viability:** For Ethereum to become a foundational layer for the global financial system, it needs to be as stable and reliable as traditional financial systems. Ossifying the protocol can help Ethereum achieve a level of robustness that encourages widespread adoption and trust.

**User and Developer Confidence:** Stability in the protocol can increase confidence among users and developers. They can be more certain that the rules and functionalities they are building on or interacting with will remain consistent over time.

**Compatibility and Interoperability:** A stable protocol ensures that applications, tools, and services built on Ethereum remain compatible over time. Frequent changes can cause fragmentation and compatibility issues, hindering the ecosystem's overall growth.


However, it's important to note that ossification is a double-edged sword. While it brings stability, it also means that the protocol may not adapt quickly to new challenges, technological advancements, or evolving user needs. The balance between stability and adaptability is crucial, and the decision to ossify would need to be carefully considered, taking into account the long-term vision for Ethereum.


In summary, the main benefits of Ethereum ossifying include enhanced security, network stability, decentralization, long-term viability, user and developer confidence, and compatibility. However, these benefits must be weighed against the potential downsides of reduced adaptability and responsiveness to new developments.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvSlRnTjJ1c3VoeG9vOTh4UjdSQlp1cnVGb1k1cDQ1WTBJV0NFVGI2NlFwWm1mQW8tN0l2WTQwbW92bzJfa1Jsc1lLbGEyVnlSWkZHUHR6d1RudWVvRUE9PQ==

"> Ethereum (and all other POS blockchains) offers a passive income to those that own ETH and stake it. 

You were corrected here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1d2r5vl/ethereum_and_decentralisation_discussion/l690zmo/

Staking is not passive income as was explained. Running a validator is a job, for which you are rewarded with income. It's not even a trivial job, the people with the skillset to do it (SysAdmins, DevOps) are very well paid in the market.

> Since ETH finally ended its vesting schedule and encountered no serious problems to redeeming natively staked ETH, the risks around staking ETH have greatly reduced.

You were corrected here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1d2r5vl/ethereum_and_decentralisation_discussion/l62m5gj/

There was no ""vesting"" schedule as was explained. That was not a thing. I think you are confusing it with unstaking not being enabled when the beacon chain launched. But that has nothing to do with a ""vesting"" schedule.

You were corrected here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1d2r5vl/ethereum_and_decentralisation_discussion/l631m9s/

Where it is explained how you are wrong. The worst kind of wrong in fact, mathematically wrong. You have ignored this, kept making the same statement and moved the goalposts. I have tried to make you see how you are wrong by asking you to make the argument on how the situation differs under PoW. After all, this is what brought you here:

>I have lost some faith in Ethereum. And I only see that I will lose more going forward. Why?
>   
>It’s because of the reality of POS blockchains. Not just Ethereum but all POS blockchains. I won’t go into what POS and POW are here. I am going to assume you know this.

You were requested here to explain how the situation differs with PoW in multiple occasions, here is one: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1d2r5vl/ethereum_and_decentralisation_discussion/l68k471/

To no avail. We are all still waiting your explanation.

How it gently applies the brakes on all our personal economic endeavours >and transfers that energy to accelerating those of the whales. They made these rules precisely for this outcome. Bitcoin breaks their rules and levels the playing field for us all.

You are still wrong. Read here for a more detailed description of how Ethereum tries to remove as much as possible barriers of entry and economies of scale. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1d2r5vl/ethereum_and_decentralisation_discussion/l68nayu/

"> I don't want to use CEX but i need a fast option, what can I do?

You asked for the safest option (native bridging) and the cheapest option (an exchange) but don't seem to really want either! There are plenty of bridges you can use such as Hop/Across/Orbiter.

> 7 days?? How is this possible to take so long

Optimistic rollups use Fraud Proofs, which have a challenge period before they are finalized to the L1.For Arbitrum (and most other optimistic rollups) this period is 7 days. As a user you want this period as it effectively prevents the operators of the L2 from doing anything nefarious. If they submitted a proof that, for example transferred everyone's assets to the operator's personal wallet, the user base would have 7 days to identify this.

I'd recommend having a read about how optimistic rollups work at: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#how-optimistic-rollups-work",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvVjdUd3FhVmV3SjZVSlctcGhadlRYWjNlTEcwVDhTQWY3MXB2Tlc2VHNzMGFjbTk1OTNfS1NtZ3V2SUt0MVJwWl9EaWMzbGdOREQ1YWhlR1hSMWkyX0E9PQ==

"I prefer Orbiter.Finance to bridge around personally. I think they take a $1 fee, otherwise the cost is comparable to native bridging. You should have your transactions completed within a couple of blocks (>30 seconds).

The other reply to yours is great at explaining why there's an Optimistic delay period. FYI there is no delay when using a ZK-Rollup's native bridge because the proof is compiled using encryption/math instead of node-incentives..

"> Are all of these upgrades genuine hard-forks in which somehow over 50% of the network participants agree?

Yes, most upgrades to Ethereum are completely non-contentious. Basically everyone in the ecosystem agrees that these forks bring improvements to Ethereum, so people are happy to run the updates.

I'll add that it _is_ getting more difficult to upgrade the network over time. There's more participants involved, less risk tolerance, less openness in general to upgrades. I think most people expect the Ethereum L1 to ""ossify"" at some point, with most of the improvements happening at other layers (L2s, AVSs, other infra).",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvWlZPc3UyWk9QUTJ6SlpzUTFDVktRZkt0a25wdTFaXzhxVlg4cmFaOGpMeXpZeTV0Nm1LazhISkhHM1gwUlliYTl6eXJnblpiQkFzRHFTcHdfdi12LVE9PQ==
"Upgrades to Ethereum are difficult, and take a long time to be decided on.

Anyone can submit an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) and anyone can contribute to any discussion of any EIP.  These discussions happen in public forums (such as EthResear.ch and Ethereum Magicians). Anyone can spin up a personal EVM to try out the changes. Anyone can read and contribute to the code on Github as the changes are being developed.

Only once the community has worked through all issues and come to a consensus does an EIP have a chance at being included in an Ethereum mainnet upgrade.

The EIP is still not ready to be included though, as each of the ~10 independent client teams needs to implement the changes to their node software (because there are many different clients, written in different programming languages, by people in different countries). Again, this all happens in public as all the main clients are open source.

There are regular meetings of 'All Core Devs' which feature the client teams, the Ethereum foundation, and other key community parts such as Ethereum Cat Herders. These meetings are streamed live and allow developers to report on progress towards implementing the agreed-upon changes, then when all the teams are ready they set dates to push the update to a testnet.

Once a testnet receives the update there are a couple of weeks in which anyone can try things out and check how the changes function. Assuming everything works the other testnets are upgraded, again with 2 or 3 weeks between each one to allow anyone interested to test whatever they want and discuss any issues that have arisen.

That whole process, from initial EIP might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 or more years. Only then when all the testnets have been upgraded and everyone is happy that things are working as intended is a date finally set for the mainnet upgrade.

New versions of clients are released for node operators and validators to update. Of course, if after all these months/years of discussion and testing the community were not behind an upgrade then they can choose not to update their clients, and this results in a forking of the chain, and anyone could choose to participate on whichever fork they agreed with. 

A scenario where 50% of node operators and validators hadn't agreed with an update but somehow hadn't voiced their concerns while consensus was being reached is pretty implausible. There are innumerable opportunities to contribute, and the only barriers to providing input are competence and laziness!",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvdURWZmZQbkh4UzV5ZjRPUkx2UDJVQ0x6alVoZGxTOGhpMHNNTGVNWmdZZG5RU0NUNGlNSVkyWS1lVW5OZ1BjczNIR0NkaHZLNGFxMkoyMDNrYlQ3VUE9PQ==
"It’s not necessarily difficult in coding terms as the blockchain itself is based on very simple fundamental cryptographic principles, but any additional layers require many hours of testing, even for the simplest upgrade or addition, so it’s really the testing that takes the majority of resources as one mistake can cause untold damage.

Just for context, take a look at some python coding tutorials on creating simple blockchains. It explains the principles and a simple chain can be coded in about 20 lines of code.

"Frank Costello and MinimalGravitas explained it quite well.

I just want to emphasize that major Ethereum upgrades are very infrequent and difficult to pass. It often takes many years before an EIP is included in an update, and many of them never pass. For example, the merge was in planning for ~6 years before it finally happened. EIP-4844 was one of the faster ones since it piggy-backed on previous ideas, and it still took 2 years. EIP-3074, which was originally planned for Pectra, was in planning before 2020.

There are many different types of updates. ERC updates happen more frequently but more like optional features that get added.

Big protocol hard forks only happen once every 1-2 years (London, Shapella, Decun, Pectra). These ones require overwhelming support from everyone on All Core Devs meetings to pass. This includes developers for all ~10 clients, applications, and supporting infrastructure.

#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #1 (Decentralized)

**""It's decentralized!!!""** / **""Crypto gives the control of money back to the people""** / **""Crypto is 'trustless'""**

1. Just because you de-centralize something doesn't mean it's better.  And this is especially true in the case of crypto.  The case for decentralized crypto is based on a phony notion that central authorities can't do anything right, which flies in the face of the thousands of things you use each and every day that ""inept central government"" does for you.  Do you like electricity?  Internet?  Owning your own home and car?  Roads and highways?  Thank the government.

2. Decentralizing things, especially in the context of crypto [simply creates additional problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=1157s).  In the de-centralized world of crypto ""code is law"" which means there's nobody actually held accountable for things going wrong. And when they do, you're fucked.

3. In the real world, everybody prefers to deal with entities they know and trust - they don't want ""trustless transactions"" - they want reliable authorities who are held accountable for things.  Would you rather eat at a restaurant that has been regularly inspected by the health department, or some back-alley vendor selling meat from the trunk of his car?

4. You still aren't avoiding ""middlemen"", ""authorities"" or ""third parties"" using crypto. In fact quite the opposite: You need third parties to convert crypto into fiat and vice-versa; you depend on third parties who write and audit all the code you use to process your transactions; you depend on third parties to operate the network; you depend on ""middlemen"" to provide all the uilities and infrastructure upon which crypto depends.

5.  If you look into any crypto project, you will ultimately find [it's not actually decentralized at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA&t=2557s).",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvNmplbm43bXhGckFGMVNVa0hkS2RRTVM2TjJzenozTXlYSjlQMkU1b2RaWFBTeWluUVZSNXpiWml2dS1DOWxwTVFZQnlmdHcxOWZSQTdaQi1uajVRaWc9PQ==

"Yes I would agree that just because you decentralize something doesn't make it better.

Simply placing the 'decentralization' label on something does NOT make it better. 

However, by distributing ownership of protocols, people can now own what they once couldn't.

I certainly agree that people would prefer to interact with entities, that's because the infrastructure in which we have set up society is that of entities that take the responsibility off of our backs - which is absolutely necessary to continue operating in the day-to-day. BUT, I do think the more we can equally distribute the ownership of those centralized networks, the more wealthy everyone can become. The ability to decentralize certain applications opens the possibility for new uses, governance, and ownership of applications.

"> However, by distributing ownership of protocols, people can now own what they once couldn't.

What does that even mean?   

That's a bunch of techno-gibberish, and I'm a damn software engineer.

With crypto, you don't ""own"" anything!   What are you talking about?

Allow me to illustrate:

What determines that you own your home?  Or your car?   Have you thought about that?

It's central authorities.  The government.  Not because you have a title that says you own your car, or a deed that says you own your home.  But because *the government has the resources to enforce that ownership*.  Without that essential element, you don't technically own anything. Whoever takes your stuff, becomes ""the owner.""

So who cares what blockchain says?  Where's the ""blockchain justice dept"" that enforces what's written on blockchain?  There is no such entity.  Acknowledging somebody owns something according to blockchain is *totally voluntary*.   Me personally?  I could care less what you think you own on chain.  It has no bearing in the real world.

>How much money has Facebook made on my data over the 13 years I've had an account? I don't know, but I would have liked to have a share of that money, at least if it was made off the back of my data, which blockchain allows given its decentralized nature.

You're conflating two entirely separate things: Facebook exploiting you (which obviously is happening, but you don't have to let them exploit you if you don't want).

"Its digital ownership. A smart contract. A verifiable peerless ledger. 

It is infinitely more efficient/ethical than existing tech. I strongly suggest you read ""read, write, own"" to understand the use cases for blockchain. Blockchain is still in its infancy. The internet took decades to be what you see today, and after reading ""read, write, own,"" blockchain will take (probably) a similar trajectory. It is very very difficult to reject the  compelling use cases. 

At the very least, closing on a house purchase takes at minimum ATLEAST a week. between real estate agents negotiating, getting financing, title signings at lawyers' offices, etc. Blockchain fixes this. A non fungible token can be developed for each individual piece of real estate, and transactions can be made on the blockchain immediately. Financing can be secured through finance DAPPS. Governments can use blockchain to verify and transfer ownership much more efficiently than current technology.

this is just one example. I'm sure there will be many more. Will it take time for these things to be developed? Absolutely. Will there be hiccups? No doubt. but like anything, the most efficient technology always wins out.

Yea, just saying that over and over doesn't make it true.

Watch my [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA) - I eviscerate your hollow claims. 

So all you can do is just call me names and repeat the same meaningless, abstract talking points over and over.

>At the very least, closing on a house purchase takes at minimum ATLEAST a week. between real estate agents negotiating, getting financing, title signings at lawyers' offices, etc. Blockchain fixes this. 

You are totally delusional.  Blockchain doesn't fix anything of the sort.

Think about it like this.. you say blockchain says you own a piece of property.  I show up with a gun and say I own that piece of property.  What's blockchain going to do then?   Not a fucking thing.

In the real world, ownership is a function of central authorities that have forces that enforce rules *in the real world*.  Blockchain has no such feature.  So nobody gives a fuck what your ""immutable digital ledger says"".  The reason a title transfer takes time in the real world is because of rules and policies that placate the very 
important central forces that enforce what ownership means.   None of that can happen on blockchain .

Yes, there is.  There are entire institutions tasked with protecting peoples private property rights: police, courts, etc.  All of those institutions are funded via the standard fiat-based economy.  That's how it works.  Even civil rights are something that government grants.  

>If the government recognizes blockchain ownership the same as title ownership, then theres no reason they wouldn't use there police resources to enforce the law the same as title ownership. 

Yea, but that's not going to happen.  That's like Tesla deciding they'll be responsible for repairing and maintaining Fords and Chevys.

This ""adoption"" is not what you think it is..


#Stupid Crypto Talking Point #8 (endorsements?)

""**[Big Company/Banana Republic/Politician] is exploring/using bitcoin/blockchain!  Now will you admit you were wrong?**"" / ""**Crypto has 'UsE cAs3S!'**"" / ""**EEE TEE EFFs!!one**""

 1.  The original claim was that crypto was ""disruptive technology"" and was going to ""replace the banking/finance system"".  There were all these claims suggesting blockchain has tremendous ""potential"".  Now with [the truth slowly surfacing regarding blockchain's inability to be particularly good at anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tspGVbmMmVA), crypto people have backpedaled to instead suggest, ""Hey it has 'use-cases'!""   

 Congrats!  You found somebody willing to use crypto/blockchain technology.  That still is not an endorsement of crypto or blockchain.  I can choose to use a pair of scissors to cut my grass.  This doesn't mean scissors are ""the future of lawn care technology.""  It just means I'm an eccentric who wants to use a backwards tool to do something for which everybody else has far superior tools available.  

 The operative issue isn't whether crypto & blockchain can be ""used"" here-or-there.  The issue is: *Is there a good reason?  Does this tech actually do anything better than what we have already been using?*  And the answer to that is, [No.](https://ioradio.org/i/blockchain-claims/)

 2.  Most of the time, adoption claims are outright wrong. Just because you read some press release from a dubious source does not mean any major government, corporation or other entity is embracing crypto.  It usually means someone asked them about crypto and they said, ""We'll look into it"" and that got interpreted as ""adoption imminent!""
 3.  In cases where companies did launch crypto/blockchain projects they usually fall into one of these categories:
  * Some company or supplier put out a press release advertising some ""crypto project"" involving a well known entity that never got off the ground, or was tried and failed miserably (such as [IBM/Maersk's Tradelens](https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/11/29/maersk-and-ibm-to-discontinue-tradelens), [Australia's stock exchange](https://www.reuters.com/markets/australian-stock-exchanges-blockchain-failure-burns-market-trust-2022-12-20/), etc.)
  * Companies (like VISA, Fidelity or Robin Hood) **are not embracing crypto directly**.  Instead they are *partnering with a crypto exchange* (such as BitPay) that will either handle all the crypto transactions and they're merely licensing their network, or they're a third party payment gateway that pays the big companies in fiat.  There's no evidence any major company is actually switching over to crypto, or that any of these major companies are even touching crypto.  It's a huge liability they let newbie third parties deal with so they have plausible deniability for liabilities due to money laundering and sanctions laws.
  
 4.  Sometimes, politicians who are into crypto take advantage of their power and influence to force some crypto adoption on the community they serve -- [this almost always fails](https://truthout.org/articles/miamis-mayor-went-all-in-on-cryptocurrency-his-constituents-suffered/), but again, crypto people will promote the press release announcing the deal, while ignoring any follow-up materials that say such a proposal was rejected.

 5.  Just because some company has jumped on the crypto bandwagon doesn't mean, ""It's the future.""

  McDonald's bundled [Beanie Babies](https://i.imgur.com/McdwlxA.jpg) with their Happy Meals for a time, when those collectable plush toys were being billed as the next big investment scheme.  Corporations have a duty to exploit any goofy fad available if it can help them make money, and the moment these fads fade, they drop any association and pretend it never happened.  This has already occurred with many tech companies from [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1464096684955433613) to [Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/finance/blockchain/microsoft-is-shutting-down-its-azure-blockchain-service/).  Even though these companies discontinued any association with crypto years ago, proponents still hype the projects as if they're still active.

 6. Crypto ETFs are not an endorsement of crypto.  They're simply ways for traditional companies to exploit crypto enthusiasts.  These entities do not care at all about the future of crypto.  It's just a way for them to make more money with fees, and just like in #4, the moment it becomes unprofitable for them to run the scheme, they'll drop it.  It's simply businesses taking advantage of a fad.  Crypto ETFs though are actually worse, because they're a vehicle to siphon money into the crypto market -- if crypto was a viable *alternative* to TradFi, then these gimmicky things wouldn't be desirable.

 7. Countries like El Salvador who claim to have adopted bitcoin really haven't in any meaningful way.  El Salvador's endorsement of bitcoin is tied to a proprietary exchange with their own non-transparent software, ""Chivo"" that is not on bitcoin's main blockchain - and as such isn't really bitcoin adoption as much as it's bitcoin exploitation.  Plus, USD is the real legal tender in El Salvador and since BTC's adoption, use of crypto has stagnated.  In two years, the country's investment in BTC has yielded lower returns than one would find in a standard fiat savings account.  Also note [Venezuela has now scrapped its state-sanctioned cryptocurrency](https://www.foreignbrief.com/venezuela-to-scrap-state-cryptocurrency/)

So, whenever you hear ""so-and-so company is using crypto"" always be suspect.  What you'll find is either that's not totally true, or if they are, they're partnering with a crypto company who is paying them for the association, not unlike an advertiser/licensing relationship.   **Not** adoption.  Exploitation.   And temporary at that.

Accessing devices and networks without permission, even running network map, is under the computer misuse act…if you initiate coordination between law enforcement in the regions the this event involved and the exchange(s) you could get an arrest and that person could be incentivized to unlock the wallet.  Obviously it can’t work every time.  Some areas, regions may care less.

"Thanks for the insights on how enums affect storage and gas costs in Solidity. I've been registering users in batches using the same Ethereum addresses, assigning roles as Consumer (enum 0) or Provider (enum 1). Initially, I observed the expected differences in gas costs between the roles, with Providers generally costing more. However, in larger batches (72, 86, 100), the gas costs for both roles start to level out, which is surprising given the substantial state changes for Providers.

**Testing Scenario:**

* **Batch Sizes:** 2, 16, 30, 44, 58, 72, 86, 100.
* **User Roles:** Assigned as Consumer or Provider.

**Observations:**

* **Smaller Batches:** There are clear differences in gas costs between roles.
* **Larger Batches:** Gas costs for Providers and Consumers start to level out.

**Questions:**

1. Could this leveling out of gas costs in larger batches be caused by EVM optimizations that affect how storage is accessed during high transaction volumes?
2. How might the reuse of addresses in each batch affect the state trie and potentially minimize gas costs over time?",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3dHUza0VESU1fUU0yTURVX18zQS1MNGZkQzBaa3N4ZmlEVlFVZWMwMUx2WDlhN001bW5GbXZOcnJnYkloVkFfQ1UzUVlRRTNkQnVRS05HMTU4cFpJM2c9PQ==

"Smart wallets seem like the best thing for getting novice users into crypto... They enable Web2 accounts with Web3 features, eg email+password or authy-app login with gasless on-chain transactions.

Similiar to what Subreddits have tried to accomplished by tokenizing Karma. Earn Karma, tip users, get paid out crypto at the end minus tips without signing a transaction.

Using a smart wallet for AA (account abstraction) the 'paymaster' (you) can preload the contract with fees eligible users can use to pay for their blockspace. You could also have users pay for their Ethereum blockspace using tokens rather than ETH. 

Coinbase has just launched their smart wallet, which will soon have direct integration into their normal wallet and CEX. Users can use their phone's passkey etc. to register, rather than creating and dealing with seed phrases.

Coinbase is also offering a [$3000 gas credit incentive](https://www.smartwallet.dev/base-gasless-campaign) to dApps which have integrated the Coinbase wallet SDK and smart wallet, up to $15K for including Coinbase in your UI, as part of their Base Gasless Campaign. Which would be a nice benefit to you as well.

For web3, do the same thing except replace ""connect a bank"" with ""connect a wallet"". This also has the benefit that there isn't a signed transaction for every single action taken.

"The safest way is to do 100% self-custody using air-gapped offline cold storage, digitally using super strong (over 40+ alphanumeric password) encryption, whereby you store everything strictly offline.

Digital can be very safe if you use expensive M-disc that never deteriorate, instead of being a cheapskate and use the usual CD/DVD that can deteriorate and lose data.

No scribbling on metal plate whereby anyone that stumble on such plate will know what it is because all the words are visible right in their face.

When you want to do any transfer, just generate a signed message offline for online broadcast using MyCrypto.

99% of everyone would suggest hardware wallet, but hardware wallet is NOT the safest way.

If you can store your mnemonic phrase/seedphrase/passphrase/etc securely, then what is stopping you from storing your private keys directly instead?

"There is a difference between staking and being a node operator.

Running your own Rocketpool nodes means you can spin up 4 mini pools and earn 14% off other peoples borrowed ETH.

You earn 100% off 8 ETH and 14% off 24 borrowed ETH (each node is 32 ETH total) which is 35.5% per mini pool... so you run 4 mini pools with 32 ETH and you are earning 100% off your 32 ETH and 14% off of 96 borrowed ETH.

There is a collateral of additional RLP token that you need to spin up these mini pools (2.4ETH worth per mini pool which is not cheap) but as long as it stays above 10% you earn staking rewards on it.

"Blobs are meant to scale out an additional 10x or more in the coming year(s), from 3-6 blobs per block to 32-64 blobs per block, which should help lower costs

That said, more security will always cost more than less security. We have ZK rollups competing with Optimistic rollups now, but since Optimistic rollups had the first mover advantage (due to taking shortcuts, and being less secure) they've taken a massive lead over technologically superior ZK rollups.

These markets don't truly value decentralization the way we all like to think. To users, lower fee = better. But I imagine if a protocol emerges that actually demands security, eg a regulared on-chain stock or Forex market, the higher costs would be justified. For most of our currently popular use cases, storing jpgs or transferring memecoins, it doesn't make sense to pay more than the bare minimum necessary.

Taiko's developers are always 5-years ahead of the curve IMO. Maybe blob costs get solved in the future in some novel way. But by then other Rollup's may look at becoming based rollups themselves.

I guess I should say the team is 5-years ahead of the curve in thought, not in technical execution. I believe they were first to create a UI for smart wallets, launched the first ZK rollup, now released the first based rollup. Those 3 will be the foundation for Ethereum's UX in the future IMO. Though each of their products have seen extremely low activity considering how invaluable their research has been to the space, their specialty absolutely isn't in designing a 'killer app'. I don't expect them to perfect their tech before some of these other teams with nearly unlimited funding.

I hope more based rollups emerge as it would do wonders in solving the UX and complexity problems users are faced with to navigate across different L2's. And the new Coinbase smart wallet ([demo](https://www.smart-wallet.xyz/)) by far has the best UX of all smart wallets I've seen, maybe the most necessary step for further adoption.

"I just recently started having an issue with Koinly so I started using CoinLedger.  CoinLedger's import was very fast and adjusts quickly when a change was made.

I like CoinLedger showing me the cost basis calculation, so I know exactly when a transaction is miscategorized and throws off the cost basis.  I don't like how CoinLedger doesn't treat ETH vs. ETH2 correctly.  Right now I have a hodge podge of both when in reality, I only have ""Eth2"".  CoinLedger uses a calculated value vs. an actual value on the exchange.  If there's a fee miscalculation, you have to go line by line to see where it happened and manually edit it to fix it to reflect your actual balances.

Koinly's transactions are easier to follow and have better tagging (swap for ETH to ETH2 is great).  Koinly's importing is somewhat suspect though.  I've had to reconnect Coinbase multiple times and it will error out occasionally.

I think I'm going to use both of them.  I'll probably reconcile Koinly against CoinLedger's cost basis then stick with Koinly.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6NDMtam1qMmR6UnY3TW9HaEp2S1hDeDNIY1QxS1RHMHVSUnZmYnFoTEIxMl9ZclBhN09FZnlJTjdvWFV3WlRaVkhBbHlLZ1ItT0E5UHBnSVVyUWhwUmc9PQ==
"Once there is 1 block confirmation (blocks occur each 12 seconds) the ETH has been transferred. You'll have to contact KuKoin's support as the issue is on their end. Most centralized exchanges will complete the transaction (txn) within 30 block confirmations, the odd time up to an hour later.

I haven't heard the name KuKoin since they were federally charged by the US back in March (for money laundering/AML practices), just FYI. That ignited a massive exodus, and tbh that historically leads to scammy behavior from the exchange - such as them not actually having coins they allow people to purchase, or locking accounts and forcing users to go through an 'upload your ID' loop dozens of times before they inevitably give up.

Why not use a more reputable (and regulated) exchange, like Kraken or Coinbase? After getting your ETH there, if you're after unusual/new tokens you can get them at Uniswap (by pasting the token 0x contract address into the Uniswap search).

Worth verifying the address you sent to again at this point. Your public address vs what's on Etherscan. Double check that your wallet has 0 balance on Etherscan also.. There is malware that can detect when a crypto address was copied, and then it will paste a different address sometimes even with the same few first/last digits. I have a notepad with my public address, any time I need to verify an address I'll paste it underneath which makes it easy to tell if anything between the two are different.

Setting the lower option for fees is fine. That's called a 'base fee' and more or less guarantees inclusion into the next block, except during extraordinary congestion.

I recommend you create a Coinbase exchange account, and use the Coinbase self-custody wallet (same as MetaMask, called Coinbase wallet). Both have a great interface and integration with each other, while Coinbase is a publically traded company in the US with stringent consumer protections in place. In the CB wallet there's 'Learn and Earn' which pays you crypto for following tutorials on different decentralized apps, which would be great to get started with (so far I think I've collected over $200 from that).

Alternatively, which ever exchange is most regulated/reputable in your Country. Also Rabby is a lot better than MetaMask for newbies (auto detects L2 networks, auto adds new tokens, scam/phishing protection, simulates transactions, etc.) if not the CB wallet.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ6U3hjSGlHMEZMWmh3UHFxZENuUzBvaXBRbTRwdVdDODl2clZOMEpRNG5LX0RRSThaUXhoN3RKTUtvNUR2TndXbk1HRjl4cE9Dc3M4TEZwUkJQaU9GZ3c9PQ==

"Well just one obvious category is public goods funding.

There are a variety of different mechanisms such as [quadratic funding](https://www.wtfisqf.com/) and [Retroactive PGF](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) that are made possible through blockchain tech. These allow more democratic allocation of resources to fund the commons than the previously available funding mechanisms which are either centrally controlled (tax and NGOs) or plutocratic (direct donations).

These are especially useful for funding [previously ignored public goods such as open source software development](https://xkcd.com/2347/), but are also starting to be used by big entities [such as UNICEF](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-unicef-qf-collaboration-pilot). The [latest RetroPGF round](https://round3.optimism.io/projects) by Optimism distributed about $100M worth of assets to reward open source contributions.

You couldn't run these types of systems in a trustless, decentralized way without an immutable, permissionless public ledger. They have been developed in parallel with decentralized identity and 'Sybil resistance) tools like Proof of Humanity and Bright ID, as well as online reputation tools like Ethereum Attestation Service, which combine to ensure you can build networks of trust between addresses without ever needing to know the real identities of participants.

"1) How do you include data of which projects you want your funds to be split between when sending a bank transfer? If I want to donate various amounts to 20 projects do you picture me making 20 separate bank transfers with the project name as the reference? Or does UNICEF have to set up a different bank account for each project they are funding and then I send 20 transfers to different accounts?

With Gitcoin or any onchain funding this is just one transaction, to a single smart contract, which is ""way easier"".

2) How do I know that UNICEF have distributed the funds according to the real amounts sent by donors? Bank accounts are not transparent, so there is no way to know that the distribution is honest unless you have regulators or whoever checking the books, which takes time is another set of people who need to be paid.

With Gitcoin all the transfers are on an open ledger, the smart contracts are open source, so anyone interested can see that the funds are distributed fairly.

3) Bank accounts do not have any logic or programmability, so even if UNICEF are completely honest it is still manual work for someone to check amounts coming in and set up the transfers to distribute the funds from the accounts in which the money was received to those to whom it is going. This isn't efficient, and introduces avenues for errors.

With Gitcoin this can all happen automatically.

4) Lets say UNICEF did set up a good process for doing this with hundreds of bank accounts for hundreds of projects, and a work flow to calculate the quadratic values, and to move money around without errors. The next NGO that wants to use quadratic funding then has to set that all up themselves as well, you can't fork trained staff, the more organizations using the system the more work overall.

With Gitcoin all the code is open source, the tooling and contracts can be shared as many times as there are organizations wanting to use it.

1) Just a regular web based form. Select your payment method, amount you want to transfer, and your own preferred allocation? I ran a small non-profit full time for two years and I could set this up in less than 30 minutes on our website.

2) This is a fair criticism, but I see no societal demand for verification other than just having the books be audited. I understand your concern, but outside of cryptocurrency/blockchain enthusiast circles there is very little demand for change.

3) Sure, but user error is a problem in any system. What if someone enters the wrong recipient address in an Ethereum based system?

4) The backend really isn't that difficult to handle right? Any organization used to processing incoming payments can do this. Besides, do you think a new NGO wanting to distribute funds with quadratic values will have more issues adopting a new blockchain based method of receiving and distributing funds, or plugging some values in an Excel file from the webform into the formula and passing the money to be distributed onto their treasury team?

Because it's supporting a government that accepts taxes from companies that are directly supported by gambling.

By staking you are supporting a network that accepts transaction fees from Blockchain services and individuals directly supported by gambling.

"When I first bought crypto, there were no centralized exchanges, it was all P2P. I met with people in diners and had coffee with them while we waited for and watched block confirmations. I met some of the most interesting people in my life that way, really smart anarchists and libertarians.

Today, crypto is so mainstream, it's seen as an investment foremost. I would be worried about exposing myself to IRL P2P today when most don't hold crypto's fundamental values any longer. The so called $5 wrench attack is a serious threat, but wasn't really when BTC was still easy to mine/mint on your own with a little bit of free time, and was seen as a philosophy more than anything..

I'd be more open to using a P2P exchange if there were different payment options available than meeting up with cash in hand. Send me your bank information or address, I will send you the cash, you send me the crypto. I don't think this process should be done locally anymore just IMO.

>The site does not facilitate any trades or communication, nor does it provide any guarantees or liability protection. 

I'm unsure what benefit there is to this over currently existing P2P exchanges like Bisq. Escrow is invaluable for currency swaps, so is a channel to communicate through. Other than for your own legal liability considering AML laws.

"> How to memorise your seed phrase quickly & easily

Step 1: Never do this.

Step 2: See step 1.

Attempting to memorize a seed phrase is a terrible idea.  It will give you a false sense of security that you've ""backed up"" into an extremely unreliable medium, which will then cause you to not take proper precautions for the real, actual, reliable backup methods.  It also puts your seed phrase at risk from being accidentally overheard, recorded or found during the extended period of time when you're trying to memorize it.

Store seed phrases on paper in highly secure, difficult-to-access locations.  If you want to ensure that your seed phrase is accessible to your family if and only if you are dead, use a bank safety deposit box.  If you want to ensure your seed phrase is protected against bank or government intrusion, fragment your seed phrase and/or use a passphrase for M-of-N.  If you want to protect your seed phrase from fire, flood and corrosion, use steel plates like a blockplate.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI1TENXLWIxYTlaZ3lja0pFN0ppZkJsOTJnZjYyQkVJdWxSaENtX2NRY1NrdXBlZUJNM2NYWVNwM3VRT09aa0VKa21ralI1eGZoLXpCX3JkcFZidVNGU3ZnSmJTdlFLQVg1dmlIVkVmY3YxaTg9

"It's been done. Localbitcoins.com was huge in the early days but there's a reason they're not around any more.  They shut down over regulatory & compliance concerns/pressure, but also because the demand is gone. I used to sell peer-to-peer & used localbitcoins as well as a few other sites & by 2020 my peer-to-peer trading had dried up to only loyal long time customers, no new ones coming in. 

With so many easy ways to buy on exchanges, no one is doing peer-to-peer. At least not enough to make it worthwhile for sellers to stay active. 

Paxful has something similar & they are still around but they regularly work with regulators to be sure they are compliant. If your site got any kind of traction at all, expect to be hearing from the government.

"Again, it’s not a technical issue, but a political one.

Property ownership is taxed. If you don’t pay your property taxes, the government has mechanisms to confiscate your property. They are able to do this because they control the official records of who owns the property.

If a decentralized ledger was used instead, then government would lose their ability to confiscate your property, which is their primary enforcement mechanism to collect property taxes.

">If you don’t pay your property taxes, the government has mechanisms to confiscate your property.

I've spent a lot of the last 10 years in Kenya. Even if you do pay taxes, have valid property deeds and have done no crime, the government can confiscate your property.

What you are saying makes perfect sense. I just wanted to illustrate how sometimes (esp. in corrupt systems) the little guy needs protection from courts & governments, which is where blockchain tech can play a big role.

Since the government does not want to go this route, the question changes:

Will there ever be more people trusting (and referring to) the blockchain ledger than people trusting the government ledger?

"Why bother giving people instructions on how to shoot themselves in the foot less badly?

> Nowhere do I suggest that you should say the words aloud,

What do you think people are going to do when trying to memorize a sequence of things that effectively represents a 79-digit number?  It doesn't matter if you tell them NOT to do it, most people couldn't even get close to doing that without it.

> anytime your seed phrase is displayed it needs to be away from the view of a camera.

That they know of.

Day, after day, after day.

No possible ways that could go wrong.  Like, if someone had roommates, or a sneaky brother or sister, or a MIL/FIL wondering what they are doing locked in their office every evening.  People live in all sorts of situations, this could go disastrously bad for someone following your instructions.

> decide to memorise your seed phrase or not.

Again, you wrote an article telling people how to do something that **is not a good idea**.  No amount of exceptions and careful wording will get away from the fact that this was never a good idea in the first place.  It wasn't a good idea with brain wallets back in the day and people have struggled with passwords for decades now.  Passwords only have an entropy on the order of 1e10 - 1e15, not 1e79.

Did you even think that people might read your article and think oh, well maybe I can just pick a seed that's easier to memorize!  And they go and look up exactly how to do that, which can be done except the last word.

I used to borrow books to study before our next meet just to try to not look like such a jackass. I did a lot more homework than I'd expect necessary talking with your average crypto investor today. Now unfortunately in most cases I am the teacher, though I still don't know shit whatever that says.

The one's I liked had a fundamental understanding of English literature, history, politics, money/economic theories, cryptography/encryption, math, networks, and Bitcoin. They were able to tie those together and explain so many things to me that I was confused with at the time in ways that made perfect sense. Something my best teachers and peers were never able to do quite as succinctly. It forever red pilled me.

I'm sure nothing stuck because I imagine by now they're all rich, and I'm still not. But it was a good time in my life to be around people like that, and have any excuse to sit with them for an hour to discuss whatever's running through their mind. Crypto-anarchism, quantum physics, meditation vs psychedelics, Perl vs Ruby...

The vision of two different way of managing a country has real world example: HongKong in China. From surface, they have two different systems, but when some of the conflict shows up, eventually the law system of HongKong will be overtaken by chinese law enforcements. In the end it is the law deciding what kind of behavior is allowed or not allowed, and that can not be different when the two system is interconnected, especially when it comes to some core values

Another example is the Soviet Union, when the fundamental value start to differ between union members, the whole ecosystem broke into small pieces

"I'm shit with words, and you're an asshole.

When I mean light up I mean showed curiosity in a topic they'd not had the chance to study, rather than teaching me or debating they'd shut up and try to learn with their full attention. Borrow my uni books for a few weeks then we'd go pour over some of my homework problems together. The fact is, it took me multiple years to get to their same understanding on a new topic after some weeks. If it was a topic they understood already I'd try to do the same back. Ultimately we challenged each other. They were intellectual friends, had I not fumbled my life up after that point they'd still be in my life today and I wouldn't be wasting my time here.

I met some shady drug vendors in that time too. I happened to self select people for the best philosophical debates over best ways to press Xanax, considering you're stuck with them nearly an hour for each transaction.

They were smart enough to hold onto 1000s of BTC in the early days, convinced it'll be worth more than gold in the coming decades. If they blundered and sold it all for pizza and never bought back in, then they'd be idiots like me. They should all be multi millionaires by now had they just not lost their keys.

Seems all the smarts evacuated BTC and migrated to Ethereum et al since then. So has my conviction, oddly. Sans a few people working on ZK proofs on Bitcoin it's a shadow of its former self. Unless you think everyone working in crypto is an idiot then idk what to tell you. I'm red pilled on autistic math nerds, and what shit they can come up with given a playground and incentives to work in. The only good conversations I have lately are with the people working on Starks.

I can code well enough to automate my jobs, I'm not ignorant to how simple it can be. I know coding doesn't make me some pariah, and never once insinuated that either. Seems you had that comment locked and loaded before I even replied considering your first message, and how the only mention of coding was mentioning 1 debate I had with an older guy over the philosophy of Perl vs Ruby that I didn't even divulge into.

The P2P sites literally called them BTC vendors. Get over yourself buddy. Crypto used to only be good to buy drugs with, more or less, most terminology mimicked that at the time.

You must think I'm room temperature idiot, that I am utterly incapable of detecting if someone else is subjectively smart, or a grifter. Nice conversation here. Precisely why I wouldn't do an in-meet P2P transaction with the assholes involved with cryptocurrency today..

Didn't mean to touch on a nerve there. *I'm sure you are just as smart too*, happy? Anyway, yea, cheers.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2REdSV3NEVVE5NWNMV1RmR2Y2d0plQmx0ZkdiYU5JVUpFZnI2ZlpzV3p6SW14X3pnLXN3elFyaHBGMExZN2RBc3BwcmVScVNITDU3ckQya29Bc3JQd1E9PQ==

"0.04 ETH? I don't see a txn for 0.4 ETH

Smart contracts can't transfer ETH, besides you have no token approvals. Looks like your seed was compromised some way.

Have you stored your seed phrase online, or on a device that connects to the internet?

Run a virus scan. Windows Defender + Malwarebytes. Before starting a new wallet. If you backed up your seed on paper, could be malware that caught it from your hot wallet.

This current wallet must be burned now, unfortunately. Whoever has your seed will continue taking from you given the chance.

Invest in a hardware wallet IMO and don't sign unlimited approvals using it.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2MWx1R0VGbnRBNjNVUHl2N1hBaUxGY1RYOXhpSTVpNkFvWG9vX19aUzVKYVAxcXpKMFhLZWlxT2tzMExkU0xDSFJ3VnBkZWFHWjVDUVE2UmdLaDlMQ0E9PQ==

OP, ethereum is not a company. There are no employees. No budget. Nobody in charge.

"The Foundation doesn't pay core developers really. The Foundation has a bag of ETH from the beginning they've used to fund bug bounties and research grants for the most part, and anyone is eligible for that (even you). No one's been paid a salary afaik, due to the fact the bag from the beginning cannot be replenished, more like one-shot deployment of funds where and when needed most - similiar to the Bitcoin Foundation in that regard.

There is something called the Protocol Guild, a fund put together a couple of years ago to ensure public good (core) developers have steady income and don't need to spend all their time working at Wendy's. This was funded by volunteers and VCs.

More recently, Vaneck pledged 10% of their ETH ETF revenues to the team of core developers to also assist with funding public goods, also on a volunteer basis.

Those two funds have been the first time I've seen steady money going to the core developers. The one is hardly a year old, and the other hasn't launched yet. The EF has had nothing to do with it.

GitCoin grants have been invaluable for funding research as well. Quadratic funding is how most Gitcoin funding has been distributed, it's essentially public governance that's weighted in a half decent fair way.

There are some 10 different versions of Ethereum running live now, which all work on the same 1 protocol together. All of the different execution and consensus clients are independent teams who are independently funded. These are the people who make Ethereum work and who implement the new research, and probably the closest thing to salaried employees you'd find though I'm not privvy into the specifics.

The Foundation's focus is in research and trying to herd all those independent cats in some way that makes sense. For example Vitalik will look at the development ongoing and piece it together into a visual roadmap, but he does not dictate the roadmap or even the direction it's going. Client diversity is an issue, more novel and lightweight clients are the solution, so the EF may spend some of their treasury funding researchers capable of creating viable alternatives, due to open source this then benefits all people working on Ethereum.

Vitalik's retroactive public goods funding idea is IMO the best way of distributing funds, which was executed by Optimism. 

Through the link below you can find some links explaining ways developers and researchers have been funded:

https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/the-protocol-guild-the-daily-gwei

Separate from that there are some good links to follow on this page, showing what the EF has funded themselves:

https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/

>The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor are they the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger ecosystem.

I saw this and needed to resurrect this account. Hi I was a post-launch Dogecoin dev (I'm no longer an active dev), and helped set up the Dogecoin Foundation.

It helps to understand how it works at a startup. Lets say I form/join a startup as a CTO. I would expect to receive a giant blob of equity in that startup, because the founders and investors (VCs) hold all of it. My salary in this context is likely to be relatively limited, because I am primarily paid in equity.

In a startup, as I then hire engineers, they would receive some equity and more salary.

There's a generalized expectation in cryptocurrency that engineers work as founders/board, but also that there is an entity which hands a lot of equity to engineers.

Because a blockchain ""having employees"" implies that it is a centralized entity capable of employing people, which it isn't. You say you didn't mean the question as criticism, and I'm sure that's true.

"The answer to what? How many exact employees they have and if they are on salaries directly paid by the foundation? No i do not because its not actually easy to fond out that information.
Its actually quite difficult.
The way these things work is usually non profit can have loads of other entities doing research or marketing for jobs or who knows what, and the employees of each entity will not be included in headcount for foundation, but they could still be considered employees when it comes to financial resources to pay them - or it could be from donations from other unrelated institutions - or a mixture of both just for one sub entity.

It is not such a straight forward question and answer, and i dont get why that is controversial?

"Pi4 or Pi5 don’t really have the RAM and IOPS. It’s doable but painful, needs a lot of tweaking to clients to fit into 8 GiB. Basically Nimbus/Geth with —cache 512, and the IO is going to be a faff. There’s one known drive model for the Pi4 that worked (Samsung T5, not T7), but unsure whether it’s still fast enough with chain state now: It may not be. Also Pi4 struggled mightily after merge, if you are validating it’ll have low effectiveness. 
For Pi5 there’s an NVMe base which would improve upon this situation.

Pi5: The choice if you want hard mode, enjoy making a node live in 8 GiB and want to think hard about your IOPS. Failure is just more fuel to your fire - this must be possible!

If you want a slightly less exciting time read on.

Easy button: Odroid H4, with 32 GiB of RAM and a TLC/DRAM NVMe drive. There’s a gist drive list.

If you don’t mind the expense and want more CPU you could also do Odroid H4 Ultra.

Nerdier, you get to obsess about whether a mainline kernel is yet available: Rock 5B or Orange Pi 5+; the 32 GiB RAM version of either if you can find it. Same comment re NVMe drive. NanoPC T6 would also work, but I think it’s limited to 16 GiB.

That drive list: https://gist.github.com/yorickdowne/f3a3e79a573bf35767cd002cc977b038

Mainline kernel status: https://gitlab.collabora.com/hardware-enablement/rockchip-3588/notes-for-rockchip-3588/-/blob/main/mainline-status.md

I am hopeful that 6.11 or 6.12 gives us something usable - just needs cpufreq, HDMI and maybe fusb302 if you care about PD.

You didn’t say why you’d want a Pi. If it’s for the ARM64 nerdery then choose a more performant ARM64 platform, see above.

If it’s just cost control then either the Odroid H4 or any used miniPC, the affectionately nicknamed “Poorteus”, gets you a node for around 300 USD, maybe another 100 on top if you want a 4TB drive now.

Poorteus: https://github.com/trevhub/guides/blob/main/Cheapnode.md

For client mix, 32 GiB gives you all the options. With 16 GiB you need to be a little more careful, something like a Nimbus/Nethermind would fit well.

It is possible - but I am deep into Linux (like 25 years experience) and I used all my tricks to optimize things. So, it was not plug and play. 

However, I really like this setup because I can run my nodes for close to a day with my UPS setup because the nodes consume very little wattage. I have really good up times and I partly credit the rpi cluster.

I like it so much I'm building another cluster with rpi5s. I cannot quite get arbitrum nitro to sync on a 4. Same with fantom. But my rpi4 cluster (a tower of 4 rpis) easily runs ethereum, Bitcoin, lightning, ipfs, and a few others.

"> Eth is not decentralized 

Eth is [measurably more expensive to attack than Bitcoin,](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4727999) and is [measurably almost equivalent in decentralization.](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icdew/2021/489000a080/1tROFlH2MRG)  You don't know what you're talking about.

> My experience with eth is certainly NOT lower transaction fees. 

Ethereum is processing 4x more transactions per day.  The fees aren't higher because it's not being used or because its arbitrary, the fees are higher because it's being used a LOT more.  At one point Ethereum miners were getting more than 13x the fee revenue per day that Bitcoin got, even though Bitcoin kept blocks small intentionally to force fees to be higher.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4LURfWkVFWUFnb3R4b0xyOHNJOGp6b2ZxaDEtTEJIRFQzYVJZZkhkOHFaY0xnaXFLdU9EMlBBdy1abUhaOGR0VUlhd0NiV2syZmk0M3lXZGRPUWRIQTBiaEdaLVgweXRXeHZpeU1mbG1DM3c9

Fees are only rarely much higher than BTC for a simple transfer, but sometimes they are.  Can't lie about the facts.  It sucks.

And Eth does in fact process more transactions, which are strong indicators of how healthy and rapidly growing the eth ecosystem is.  That's my point.

"Something to remember - just like a bank, your crypto is not actually in your wallet.

The Ethereum network acts like a huge distributed database, every time a new block is mined, it is linked to previous blocks with information on how much of a certain token should be available for withdrawal from a certain address.

This is part of the calculation done in the Ethereum Virtual Machine every time a transaction is processed. It knows exactly how much of which token is currently active, vs how much has been burned.

For that, the calculation of gas fee takes the current amount of tokens, volume of all transactions, and availability of nodes to algorithmically shift the fee to facilitate times of high traffic vs low traffic.

And just like a bank, you are incentivised to save when interest is high (gas fees), as these high fees are used to reward the savings accounts(validators).

Ethereum has no concept of “abandoned wallets” because “wallets” are just a human expression to help us understand and interface with the blockchain. Ether does not get lost, it can’t. The Ethereum Blockchain knows where it is at all times and adjusts for it accordingly. So crypto in your wallet is not like a traditional wallet, It’s more like a spreadsheet.

"I think you understand this perfectly well and like your username indicates, you're the voice of reason. 

Ethereum isn't tackling base layer money. They don't care to and if they did they wouldn't have changed their monetary policy many times nor their mining protocol to staking. Staking has been around for shy of 3 years and I still see no meaningful improvements to tackling base layer many, just more ""blcokchain"" versions of existing software. Sure, you can call it decentralized but I don't really consider staking a consistently decentralized protocol. The fact of the matter is Ethereum had an ICO that was not designed for fair distribution, they have founders and leaders that have heavy influence and control over the protocol, and those very same aspects allow PoS to be manipulated which is the opposite of fair money. The equation is pretty simple. If I have more ETH, I can have more full vaildators, I increase my chance of a full reward, rinse and repeat. You may not see this happening, but a base layer money and store of value shouldn't have these properties. But yeah you can send a lot of TPS so...cool? One is always useless without the other, at least if your goal is to actually fix broken money which is a cause of so many issues in the world.

"Eth has an issuance mechanism which is called Eip1559. It ensures a constant stream of revenue to validators to provide security. This is on the form of issuance, tip fees and other mev.

Bitcoin also has issuance and tip fees. However the issuance halves every 4 years which means profitability decreases. It makes the money harder but the incentives to secure the network less. What happens when issuance is so low it's negligible? The network must rely on only tips. This requires a certain about of ""crossing fingers"" that there will be enough network activity to provide tip fees.

Eip1559 provides constant economic security. It's quite amazing.

Further, both Ethereum and bitcoin can fork away bad actors. The difference is you can slash the attackers stake in Ethereum, reducing their economic attack power or simply forbid them to join the network.

In btc because there's no stake, you can fork away the bad actor but since they still have their hardware and electricity, they can ""spawn camp"" the network and attack the new fork.

I believe also it requires over 60% of circulating supply of ETH VS 51% btc for majority attacks.

Another consideration is that the bitcoin protocol has ONE software service to run. What is there's a bug in the code? In the language? A team member goes rogue? 

Ethereum had multiple clients written in multiple languages by teams.

"> Which is easier to obtain, money or mining hardware?

I know you think that you're super smart and have it all figured out, but both simply boil down to money.  You think the ""difficulty"" of obtaining hardware makes one damn bit of difference when we're talking about 20 to 60 billion dollars?  At that level, ""easier"" is meaningless.

> if you seriously believe that mining hardware is easier to acquire and therefore Bitcoin is easier to centralise then I don’t know what to tell you.

Chinese government sends 2 military batallions to capture every large Bitcoin mine & pool operator in the country.  Oops, looks like it was easier after all.

So you tell me, Mr Brainiac, what's ""easier"", the Chinese government using the military to seize 10 large unarmed Bitcoin mines just trying to do their jobs / stay afloat, or the Chinese government trying to seize 3 million Ethereum stakers from wealthy, well-connected citizens?

Must be the 3 million, because eth bad!

> The more money you have the more power you have over eth

"> Okay so your argument is you can print hardware like you can money?

You do know all hardware uses PCB's - ""Printed Circuit Boards"" right?  Just to highlight the irony of your lack of knowledge.

Yes, when someone has a budget of 20 billion dollars, they can print hardware.  20 billion dollars is more than Bitmain spends designing an asic chip.  Again, I wouldn't expect you to get any of this because the numbers are just huge.

Total value of all gold in Fort Knox = 290 biillion dollars.

Total value of Amazon = 1,910 billion.  AWS is 16% of Amazon revenue, so yeah, AWS is quite literally worth more than all the gold in Fort Knox.

"UTXO is bad for L2 scaling

With a global state + fraud proofs each L2 inherits the L1's full security assumptions and validator set. With UTXO each L2 is an independent network akin to a sidechain or competing fork with its own security assumptions.

These competing sidechains open themselves up nasty game theories. The usual way out is through an additional subset of (permissioned / reputation based) monitoring nodes who watch over the entire network; increasing complexity, cost, and reducing security.

A UTXO cannot be compressed a tenth as much as an entire block or ZK proof can be. The dust from small transactions accumulating dramatically increases the storage requirements held by L1 nodes over time, likely to the point of requiring additional off-chain data availability nodes; increasing complexity, cost, and reducing security. This leads itself to funky things like data **unavailability** in the case of mass exits, which either deletes user funds or enables invalid transactions to take place. The solution to this is the DA nodes also must be permissioned and/or reputation based, else lock up massive amounts of collateral otherwise being used to secure the L1. A mass L2 exit would lead to extreme L1 congestion which would hault a fixed-fee UTXO chain like Cardano.

Essentially with an accounts based model additional L2's don't harm the L1's decentralization, and with the UTXO model L2's necessarily increase complexity/centralization while competing with the L1's own security budget.

A good way to look into this argument is by looking into Plasma chains. Ethereum already tried this model once before, and was even going to shard which is what's necessary to implement this on UTXO. There is a ton of thorough research why Plasma didn't/can't work, (meaning it is too limited and subpar to use in practice), leading to why Plasma and sharding was scrapped for (accounts based) Rollups instead.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDeXRLNG9hVGlTdS1rM3NIa2NwQXotMUtONkRKNDVmdUJuYmhHLUpzMURXMVFBNFg2eGJJQllTVFQtb2RJNVRFU2xNbnJrNUF1dk5QTzJXY0UxWDdGRXc9PQ==

"They only mean lost in an economic sense. Everyone who's used ETH during congestion understands this well, there's not a need to be pedantic here.

If you have $0.01 of ETH in an address and fees to send it out are $0.50, the $0.01 it is ""lost""... Using common definitions for lost, the 1 cent ""cannot be recovered"" or has been ""wasted"". The user has ""failed to retain it"" or otherwise been ""depraved of it"".

All dust below the gas rate is economically unrecoverable. Yes, technically they can spend $0.50 to put a different $0.50 in their wallet to send the $0.01 back out, but spending $1 for 1c doesn't make much sense (considering ETH is fungible) so it's best to consider it lost.

There is no ETH 2. That was a unfortunate marketing term for the switch to POS that was abandoned because it kept confusing people. If you just want to run a node it doesn't take much hardware for BTC or ETH. The switch to POS doesn't have much to do with running a node. Under POS you can validate on the same hardware your node runs on.

"It's a common trope with BTC maxis that ~*n* BTC have been lost already, and therefore price discovery is more likely to occur sooner than common sense would imply. Eg the first million coins or however assuming Satoshi remains 'lost'. I think this is where OP got their idea from. There is 21M total BTC but if 5M are 'lost' there's only 16M, making any one a lot more scarce. It's a perverse idea but not an uncommon one.

Lost Ether has relatively 0 impact on the running of the network (assuming a validator doesn't 'lose' their private keys) but a non-0 impact to Ether's price sensitivity. Which I think was clear is what OP was alluding at.

I don't agree with you that the principals of supply and demand don't apply to cryptocurrencies, especially POS cryptocurrencies They are finate assets like any other. Roughly, if 1/2 the total amount of Ether is lost (inaccessible, for any reason) the price will be 2x as sensitive to fluctuations. Granted, the supply of fiat plays a much larger role in price discovery here, but the amount of coin circulating or available to purchase is always on the other side of that equation.

This sub is hugely ignorant to how cryptocurrencies work. It can be frustrating at times.

"Plasma is Lightning, essentially. My same post and links all apply.

Lightning is better at scaling UTXO than account based global state systems mostly due to the reduced transaction complexity possible in UTXO and inherit nature of smart contracts in AB, so there are fewer tradeoffs that need to be made.

I wouldn't say Lightning is superior to on-chain Rollup's though, especially whenever data availability (value) is much of a concern.

On-chain L2's aren't really viable on a decentralized UTXO chain so it's not really apples to apples. Lightning is the best UTXO can achieve without scaling the L1 to the same level as the L2 which would defeat the purpose. If UTXO could handle an on-chain L2 some way those Rollups/L2's would be superior to Lighting on UTXO, and maybe on par with Rollup's on AB global state systems.

You can still have your coins effectively deleted using the Lightning Network on BTC, LN requires persistent watchtower nodes to reduce the risk which severely reduces the security guarentees held by the L1. While it naturally trends towards centralization due to the tradeoffs involved in bridging in/out or its state channels/routing. It doesn't actually solve scaling because you can't purchase 'Lightning BTC' in any decentralized or permissionless manner in the way you can purchase 'ETH already on some L2'.

All of Lightning's issues have be resolved with on-chain Rollups/L2's which IMO makes them far superior. Though it's still an apples to oranges scenereo given it's comparing state vs no-state; just meaning it's easier/better to work with your already decentralized state with the option to remove the state (Plasma) - vs trying to layer in a state into a no-state decentralized L1 while maintaining decentralization.",r/ethereum,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDSWt1U19jTnppSkxGVWYya09jd2NmS19PY1JJUk43M2lIVjFKeGNfanFXM2xFb05aZC1qMDNrV1B4UzVHSVlHWTZlemN0N2g1Y1lsaWdvSHNzUDJMaGc9PQ==
"You can’t ask questions about a distributed network and be unhappy that you got a technical answer though. As far as I am aware, Ethereum is a decentralised blockchain network. You ask technical questions, a software developer is going to give you a technical answer. I am not gate-keeping (hence why I was giving a lot of context and comparisons to traditional banking in my original answer). I want more people to get into Cryptocurrencies, but there’s a level of understanding that you need to have if you are going to ask technical questions.
