"The role of ETC is to provide a truly uncensorable programmable monetary network. The value of this will become truly obvious when centralised projects are forced to censor transactions.

ETH will likely be a US-Imperialism/West controlled network. More innovative parts of the West economy and all of the global south will ditch ETH. 
Therefore ETC is a low-to-fair probability big return investment.  

Until censorship is a greater fear, ETC will ramble along, losing value to BTC.

But even now it is an important network for those who care about these things and want to build on a secure network.  If you're building a global app and you might be doing something that US monopolies won't like, you'd be crazy to build on ETH instead of ETC.

"Here is my logic for holding ETC.  BTC is crippled as a transactional chain, I don't own or really want to own ETH but it is by far the biggest coin after BTC by market cap. In a world whet ETH eats BTC's lunch it may well take ETC with it as many still believe in fixed supply and POW code is law etc.

FWIW I don't think this will happen which in a way is more interesting from an investment thesis, because if it ain't BTC or ETH for general crypto transactions it will be something entirely different.

ETC is pretty dead but so are most og smart contract projects, and anyone of them might get leveraged for something interestng if Greyscale can bet back on track it could be ETC.

">IP-4844 introduced “blobs,” a mechanism that allows transaction data to be stored separately and temporarily, reducing the fees paid for block data on Ethereum layer-2 networks.

>Additionally, Dencun introduced proto-danksharding, which saw more efficient data availability for block space on the Ethereum mainnet.

>While this saw a massive reduction in the cost of executing transactions on Ethereum layer-2 networks such as Abritrum and Optimism, the total amount of ETH burned on the mainnet has fallen significantly.

>While ETH supply has flipped inflationary in recent months, the total supply of ETH has still decreased significantly since the Merge.

>In total, more than 1.5 billion ETH has been burned since September 2022, while 1.36 billion ETH has been added, resulting in an overall supply reduction of 345,000 ETH, equating to just over $1.1 billion at current prices since Ethereum switched to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.",r/ethereumclassic,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEb3loN0tRRFVlTV9YdGo2bUxoLVhYTFQ2bW9oMUhRc2dRX25IUHdSSlgyV1ExRmRFdUlwakdVQjZsRy1XaGFPQzRkWFF4VWFoZ1ktVnJvOFlyMUVPeHc9PQ==
