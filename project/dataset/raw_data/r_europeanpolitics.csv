">Poland’s constitutional court has ruled that a bill was passed unconstitutionally due to the exclusion from parliament of two opposition politicians who lost their parliamentary seats after receiving criminal convictions.

>The politicians in question, from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, argue that they were illegitimately excluded and still hold their seats due to being pardoned by President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally.

>The Constitutional Tribunal (TK) has now endorsed that view. Its decision may have further consequences as it seems likely similar rulings will be issued regarding all bills passed without the involvement of the two politicians, including vital budgetary legislation.

>However, a deputy speaker of parliament has indicated that they will ignore the TK’s ruling – as they have with others in the past – because the tribunal, which is stacked with appointees from when PiS was in office, is “acting on political orders”.

>

>In January, Duda began referring all bills passed by parliament to the TK due to his “doubts” that they were legally adopted given the exclusion of PiS politicians Mariusz Kamiński and Maciej Wąsik.

>The pair – who served as ministers in the PiS government during its time in power from 2015 to 2023 – were in December handed jail sentences and banned from holding public office after being convicted of abusing their powers.

>They argue that those sentences were illegitimate because Duda had previously pardoned them. But those pardons are themselves disputed, with the Supreme Court finding last year that they were issued illegitimately but the TK ruling that the Supreme Court had no right to rule on that issue.

>

>In December, Szymon Hołownia, the speaker of the lower-house Sejm and one of the leaders of Poland’s current ruling coalition, excluded Kamiński and Wąsik from parliament due to their convictions. They appealed against that decision.

>In January, one chamber of the Supreme Court ruled that the decision to end Wąsik’s parliamentary mandate was invalid. But a week later, another chamber upheld the decision to end Kamiński’s mandate. However, he argues that that decision was made by a chamber not authorised to rule on the issue.

>Subsequently, Kamiński and Wąsik were forced to begin serving their two-year jail sentences in January before being released soon after when Duda issued them with new pardons.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEVWRvVndiMUtzWjYtcEV6TFRhcUZCdjlhVmlRSzI3VW9vQW9zM3VaWG9kX3IyNnZsLWc0U1RadDI5ekVpbHYza0dyUXN6dFpBMmt5ZHBUVEtKcG5WTnc9PQ==

">On Thursday, the TK issued its first ruling on a request by Duda to assess the constitutionality of legislation passed by parliament while Kamiński and Wąsik were excluded.

>It found the bill in question – relating to research and higher education – to be invalid due to “a defective formation of the composition of the Sejm which passed the examined law”.

>“The unconstitutionality of the reviewed law is caused…by the fact that two MPs, as a result of arbitrary actions of the speaker of the Sejm…were not allowed to participate in the procedure,” said TK in a statement after the publication of the judgment.

>“The illegal actions of the speaker of the Sejm had the effect of undermining the will of a particular group of voters who considered that Mariusz Kaminski and Maciej Wąsik should represent the nation,” it added.

>In view of this, the court ruled that the bill under review was incompatible with article 7 of the constitution, which requires the authorities to act on the basis and within the limits of the law; article 104, which states that MPs are representatives of the nation; and article 96, which stipulates that the Sejm consists of 460 MPs.

>

>The verdict was reached unanimously by a panel of five judges, two of whom – Krystyna Pawłowicz and Stanisław Piotrowicz – are former PiS MPs who served alongside Kamiński and Wąsik in parliament. Another was the court’s chief justice, Julia Przyłębska, who is a close personal associate of PiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński.

>The current ruling coalition in the past has argued that it has an obligation to ignore TK rulings passed with the involvement of Pawłowicz and Piotrowicz when they have a conflict of interest as former PiS MPs, and with the involvement of Przyłębska, whose term they argue has legally expired.

>In response to yesterday’s verdict, a deputy speaker of the Sejm, Piotr Zgorzelski, told Polsat News that “no one will care about the ruling of the TK, which has lost its impartiality” and “has acted for many years on political orders”.

>At this month’s European elections, Kamiński and Wąsik stood as PiS candidates for the European Parliament and both were elected.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZVA4OHVta0Q1cVFPRDFYZnB0S3N6Y2RhOTF1OWlXLVN2VWhhcjhsTmw3U1NWUnl2QXJJV0hnVHd4dzdxOFprS3dvVUxwUnotbzhWb0didDltajBMdXc9PQ==
">Two alleged members of Russian private military company the Wagner Group will stand trial in Poland on charges including terrorism. If found guilty, the men, who are both Russian citizens, face up to ten years in prison.

>Prosecutors announced on Friday that the pair, who can be named only as Andrei G. and Alex T. under Polish privacy law, had been indicted for crimes including participating in the activities of foreign intelligence and participating in an international armed group aiming at committing terrorist offences.

>

>The suspects were first detained in August last year by Poland’s Internal Security Agency (ABW), with the interior minister at the time saying they had been “distributing propaganda materials of the Wagner Group in Kraków and Warsaw”.

>Before that, posters encouraging people to join the Wagner Group had appeared in public places in those cities. Shortly after being arrested, the two Russian men were charged and placed in pretrial detention, where they have remained since.

>In a statement today, the national prosecutor’s office said that “the defendants recruited Polish citizens and foreigners residing in Poland for mercenary military service prohibited by international law (the PMC Wagner Group)”.

>“For this purpose, they put up at least several hundred recruitment stickers that enabled direct contact with other people responsible for recruitment and organisation,” continued the statement.

>

>Additionally, the pair are accused of working for Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR). They were tasked with “conducting the so-called hybrid war, including propaganda activities aimed at destabilising the political situation and causing damage to Poland”.

>“Hybrid war” is a term often used by Polish and European authorities to describe a range of non-military tactics used by Russia and its ally Belarus, such as spreading disinformation, carrying out cyberattacks, and orchestrating a migration crisis on Poland’s borders.

>In recent months, a number of people suspected of carrying out espionage and sabotage on behalf of Russia have been detained in Poland.

>In response to such threats, the Polish government has recently announced increased spending on border fortifications, cybersecurity and the security services.

>

>The Wagner Group, founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, once a close ally of Vladimir Putin, played a prominent role in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has also been used as a proxy force by Russia elsewhere, notably in Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic.

>After leading a failed rebellion in Russia itself last year, the Wagner Group relocated some of its forces to Belarus, where its mercenaries became engaged in training exercises with the Belarusian military, including near the border with Poland.

">Poland is close to concluding a contract with South Korea to purchase a further 180 K2 Black Panther tanks, some of which will be manufactured in Poland itself for the first time, the defence minister has announced.

>Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz was speaking after meeting in Warsaw with his South Korean counterpart, Shin Won-sik, on Thursday.

>“We have full confirmation of the will to cooperate and provide all technical information as soon as possible so that Polish arms plants can prepare for the production of K2 tanks in Poland,” said Kosiniak-Kamysz, who noted that the final contract would likely be signed in September.

>“Yes, there will be production in Poland,” said Kosiniak-Kamysz. “The minister \\[Won-sik\\] has confirmed this…All efforts and resources are directed towards getting this production started as soon as possible.”

>

>However, he admitted that “preparing the production line, preparing and adapting the technology to Polish conditions takes time” and claimed that “unfortunately we have inherited major delays in this area” from the previous government.

>The head of South Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration, Seok Jong-gun, confirmed yesterday that there is “a high possibility that the second executive contract for the K2 tank exports will be signed in Poland this September”, reports the Yonhap News Agency.

">Students from Lithuania’s large ethnic Polish minority have been able to take high-school graduation exams in the Polish language for the first time in a quarter of a century.

>This week, 778 pupils at Polish schools in Lithuania took exams in Polish language and literature, reports Lithuanian state broadcaster LRT.

>“This is a historic day for us,” Krystyna Dzierżyńska, president of the Association of Polish Schools in Lithuania, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). “After a quarter of a century of patience and pushing, we have finally managed to restore the native language exam in our schools to the proper level.”

>

>With around 183,000 members according to the 2021 national census, the Polish community constitutes 6.5% of Lithuania’s total population and is the country’s largest ethnic minority.

>However, in 1998, the education ministry decreed that exams taken in minority languages would no longer count as official school-leaving qualifications, reports PAP. Many pupils at Polish schools continued to take exams in Polish, but they had to also separately sit official Lithuanian exams.

>In 2019, the Lithuanian and Polish education ministers signed a declaration on the education of their respective minorities in each country. According to Poland’s most recent census, also from 2021, just over 10,000 people identify as ethnic Lithuanians.

>That agreement led to the restoration of high-school graduation exams in Polish in Lithuania. In 2022, a core curriculum for students taking Polish language and literature was introduced, notes LRT.

>

>On Tuesday this week, the first set of pupils took final exams based on that curriculum. Among the essays they could choose from was writing an interpretation of the poem “The Envoy of Mr. Cogito” by renowned Polish writer Zbigniew Herbert. The results will be published on 12 July.

>Dzierżyńska told PAP that she hopes the restoration of official exams in Polish will help improve the quality of Polish teaching in Lithuania, which “has been pushed to the margins in recent years”.

>She noted that the 2019 intergovernmental agreement has also facilitated the import of new textbooks to Lithuania from Poland, replacing previous decades-old ones that were “outdated and physically worn out”.

>

>Poland has recently established a so-called buffer zone on the Polish-Belarusian border. It covers a 60-kilometer-long strip of land in the Podlaskie province in the northeast of the country and is expected to ease the work of the Polish authorities.

>In 2021, the then-governing party, the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS), created a buffer zone for the same reasons. That zone was highly militarized and with access to it restricted.

>The press and humanitarian aid workers were prevented from entering, drawing much criticism from human rights advocates and the previous opposition, now the ruling coalition.

>According to the Polish interior minister, media and humanitarian aid workers will be granted passes to enter the new buffer zone.

">Ukraine and Moldova will open formal accession talks with the EU on Tuesday, some two weeks after the bloc announced that both countries had met the requirements to begin negotiations.

>The opening ceremony in Luxembourg will be highly symbolic for the two countries. They have both long harbored EU membership aspirations but at the same time seen these hopes battered by numerous and, at times, seemingly insurmountable problems.

>Ukraine is fighting off a Russian invasion that could, at worse, lead to its destruction as a nation state or at least see it dragged back into Moscow’s sphere of influence.

>Moldova has to contend with a frozen conflict and Russian peacekeepers on its territory, owing to a strip of Moldovan land breaking away to become the self-declared and unrecognized republic of Transnistria.

>But by beginning the talks, the EU is signaling that both countries are on a path taking them away from Russian influence and towards greater integration with the West.

>The moment will be poignant for many Ukrainians, who trace their current conflict with Moscow back to the Maidan uprising of 2014, when protesters toppled a pro-Russian president who reneged on a pledge to develop closer ties with the EU.

>Ihor Zhovkva, foreign policy adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the formal opening of accession talks would give Ukrainians’ morale a big lift.

>“It is very important,” Zhovkva said. “The path to full-fledged membership, which Ukraine deserves… is irreversible.”

>Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna will lead the Ukrainian delegation at the event, known in EU jargon as an Accession Conference.

>The European Commission said on Tuesday on social media: “We stand at the threshold of a key moment for these two countries. Together, we can forge a larger and forward-looking Europe.”Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib will speak for the EU, as Belgium holds the bloc’s rotating presidency.

>The journey to EU membership is arduous for candidate states owing to the need to meet the bloc’s standards on a wide range of issues, from fighting corruption to harmonizing customs rules.

>But the war adds an extra layer of challenges for both Kyiv and Brussels, raising questions that neither wants to answer at the moment, such as whether Ukraine could join if Russian forces were still occupying part of its territory.

>The prospect of Moldovan membership poses similar questions, albeit on a far smaller scale, owing to the status of Transnistria and the presence of Russian soldiers.

>The two countries will have to navigate not just technical and legal obstacles to membership but also political hurdles.

>Candidate countries need approval from all 27 EU members to open and close each step of membership negotiations, giving European governments numerous opportunities to hold up the process.

>[Hungary](https://tvpworld.com/78810531/hungary-has-deprived-itself-of-its-veto-right-says-polish-fm)—which maintains closer ties to Russia than other EU members and does not give arms to Kyiv—held up the start of the talks, citing concerns about the rights and treatment of ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine, according to diplomats.

>Enlarging the EU to include Ukraine, Moldova, and other hopefuls such as Western Balkan countries and Georgia would require a radical overhaul of EU rules on everything from farm and economic development subsidies to decision-making procedures, analysts say.

">Poland’s defence minister has waded into a row over the Museum of the Second World War in Gdańsk by criticising its new management – appointed by his own government – for removing some Polish wartime heroes from its main exhibition.

>The museum’s authorities say they are simply restoring the exhibition to its original form, before changes were made to it under the former national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government. They accuse their critics of using historical heroes as “hostages”.

>

>“Removing those who testified to patriotism and the steadfast fight for the good of the homeland is unacceptable,” tweeted defence minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz this morning. “Fragments of the exhibition concerning Captain Witold Pilecki, Father Maksymilian Kolbe and the Ulma family should be restored immediately.”

>[Pilecki](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/03/16/european-parliament-names-room-after-polish-wwii-hero-pilecki/) was a member of the resistance who deliberately had himself imprisoned at Auschwitz in order to gather intelligence and organise resistance in the camp. [Kolbe](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/07/24/polands-monk-firefighters-given-new-engine-to-help-protect-planned-mega-airport/) was a priest who gave up his life for another Auschwitz inmate. The [Ulmas](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/10/polish-family-murdered-for-sheltering-jews-during-holocaust-beatified-by-vatican/) were a family murdered by the German occupiers for helping Jews.

>Kosiniak-Kamysz’s comments came in response to an announcement by the museum’s management yesterday in which they said that parts of the exhibit showing Pilecki, Kolbe and the Ulmas were being removed.

>

>Their decision relates to a long-running dispute over the museum, which was opened in 2017. The then-ruling PiS party criticised its exhibition for not sufficiently emphasising the suffering and heroism of Poles during the war. It appointed a new director, Karol Nawrocki, who began making changes to the exhibition.

>That prompted criticism from many Polish and international historians, including Norman Davies and Timothy Snyder, who had been involved in creating the original exhibition.

>Davies, a renowned international scholar of Polish history, accused PiS of using “Bolshevik” tactics in “a xenophobic attempt to rewrite history”.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEZmZTb0tlWWVyeHlVS0ZXenBtNlhJWFNBUl9lWWVBVjFnX0VQbXQ1REZGdDZjck04ZUhydlhVeG1pNk9SMHRuQzNrcVhacVdoZDVsTmdiaUlBNkZwUFE9PQ==
">In December 2023, the PiS government was removed from power and replaced by a more liberal coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. In March this year, the culture minister dismissed the PiS-appointed director of the museum, Grzegorz Berendt.

>The following month, a new director, Rafał Wnuk, was appointed. He was one of the authors of the original exhibition at the museum. Yesterday, the museum announced that it was now “returning to the original vision of the authors” of the exhibition.

>This will involve changes to two sections of the exhibition relating to German-Nazi concentration and death camps. In one part, a display case relating to Roman Catholic clergy imprisoned in the camps as well as portraits of Kolbe and Pilecki – all of which were added by the PiS-appointed management – were removed.

>

>In its statement issued yesterday, the museum argued that these additions “in the central points of this space disrupted the anthropological nature of the narrative”, which sought to “deliberately not distinguish” between “professional, national or social categories” of prisoners.

>“Similarly, placing a large-format photograph of the Ulma family in the ‘Road to Auschwitz’ section, which talks about the deaths of prisoners in mass extermination camps, broke the artistic composition and narrative coherence of this part of the exhibition,” they added.

>The Ulmas were never prisoners in a camp. Instead, they were summarily executed by German gendarmes in their home village of Markowa after it was discovered they had been sheltering Jews in their home.

>

>The museum noted that there would be “further steps” taken to “restore the coherence of the entire exhibition”, though without specifying what they would be.

>The actions of the new management were criticised by figures from PiS, which is now the main opposition party. “This is an anti-Polish scandal,” tweeted former education minister Przemysław Czarnek. “Tusk should immediately resign.”

>While Kosiniak-Kamysz – who is part of Tusk’s government – also joined the criticism, another leader figure in the ruling coalition, speaker of parliament Szymon Hołownia, today urged calm and called for the issue not to become “another front in the Polish-on-Polish war over history”.

>“I have unlimited respect for the sacrifice of the Ulma family, I consider Maksymilian Kolbe a national hero, but historians, not politicians, should decide what should be included in the exhibition,” said Hołownia, quoted by the *Rzeczpospolita* daily.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEbnAta0JUQUdRREh3TzdCdzRIRUZzUjh3MmwxNEZ5djd2TU1VNENrTEVseFRVLTkzSlctUHptN1J2TVU1eWRKdXhaY2RkS2JzZ1VZYUo4Z1l2Um9SdXc9PQ==

">Prime Minister Donald Tusk has confirmed that a planned “mega-airport” in central Poland, which was a flagship project of the former ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, will go ahead. The decision ends months of uncertainty over the plans following December’s change of government.

>However, Tusk also accused PiS of wasteful spending on the project and said that the new government would place greater emphasis on developing regional rail, road and air infrastructure to make Poland “one big megalopolis”.

>

>In July last year, when PiS was still in power, a [design concept for the Solidarity Transport Hub (CPK) project](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/07/06/design-concept-unveiled-for-polands-planned-mega-airport/) was unveiled. In October, an [international consortium of investment partners](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/10/24/poland-names-e1-8-billion-international-investors-in-mega-airport-project/), who will contribute up to 8 billion zloty (€1.84 billion) in exchange for a minority stake, was announced.

>However, after Tusk’s government came to power, it [fired the CEO of CPK](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/01/22/boss-of-polands-planned-mega-airport-fired-as-new-government-launches-audit/) and announced that it would conduct an audit before confirming whether and how the project would continue. Some [senior figures in the new government had suggested](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/02/12/polands-mega-airport-plans-caught-in-political-headwind/) that the planned airport should be abandoned.

>But there were also supporters of the project within the ruling camp. Meanwhile in May, a group of leading Polish business figures [called on the government](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/05/04/business-leaders-call-on-polish-government-not-to-abandon-mega-airport-project/) not to abandon CPK, which they said could “become a great driving force of the Polish economy”.

>

>Speaking today, Tusk said that before making a decision he had “wanted to have a full picture of what Poland needs and what dreams correspond to these Polish needs, and not whose political orders they should fulfil”.

>The prime minister then confirmed that the airport element of CPK, located between Warsaw and Łódź, will go ahead. “We will build the most modern airport in Europe,” he declared. However, he added that a realistic aim for annual passenger numbers would be 34 million.

>When PiS first outlined plans for CPK, it declared an aim of 100 million passengers annually, which would have made it one of the busiest airports in the world. That was later scaled back to an initial target of 40 million with the option to scale up to 50 million, then 65 million and eventually even 100 million.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNESDRCbHVWWjlueXJUWktBdV9WeTFQUF8zb1hfR0tRc1RkYlZBTEJEcVNjMzBBa3J4c0tlM2htZEpiS3dqcWhGM2NLNlBWVkRhX0pteU1yanhPcW1Jd0E9PQ==
">In his announcement today, Tusk said that the government would now place greater emphasis on connecting the whole of Poland to modern transport infrastructure.

>“Poland will become one big megalopolis,” said Tusk. He outlined an aim of making it possible to travel by rail “between the capital and all major urban centres in 100 minutes or less”. His plans envision Warsaw, rather than CPK, being the rail hub.

>PiS’s plans were for CPK to be not just an airport, but also a rail and road hub Tusk, however, said that the PiS government had failed to put those ideas into practice. He pointed to a planned rail tunnel beneath central Łódź, which was supposed to be completed by 2022 but has been hit by construction delays and rising costs.

>Speaking alongside Tusk, Maciej Lasek, the government’s plenipotentiary for the CPK project, said that the cost of its air and rail elements would be 131 billion zloty (€30.4 billion), which he said was lower than the 155 billion zloty planned by PiS.

>

>The prime minister also pledged to maintain Poland’s network of smaller regional airports, which some had feared would be overshadowed by CPK.

>This, said Tusk, will include “quickly expanding and modernising Modlin” airport to make it a hub for “popular, low-cost airlines” and to better connect it by rail and road to the centre of Warsaw.

>Okęcie, Warsaw’s main airport, which had been scheduled to close once CPK opened, will also be “urgently modernised and improved”, said Tusk, who noted that the airport at CPK will not be ready until 2032.

>Once the CPK airport is operational, “the future of \\[Okęcie\\] will be decided, added the prime minister, who suggested it could continue to function as an “air transport centre” for drones.

>

>Finally, the prime minister also pledged that Poland’s national airline, LOT, would be improved “so that it will become a company more or less on the level of Lufthansa”, Germany’s flag carrier.

>Despite Tusk confirming that CPK will go ahead, he faced immediate criticism from his PiS predecessor Mateusz Morawiecki, who accused the government of “rebuilding CPK so that it does not pose a threat to the Germans and Austrians”.

>Morawiecki also accused Tusk of returning to his old strategy, from when his PO party previously ruled Poland from 2007 to 2015, of focusing only on the development of large cities.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEYk1IOE51SEEyR3NZazlsMzQ1MHp0Q2FEZzVkb2otaFYyV3laUGVPaWFkUHZSa0tMUFpZZWpXZENLb2dhR3VIOG9KeDN1LXkxWkVwcVZHQUx4UXY2anc9PQ==

">The German authorities have so far this year sent back over 4,600 people to Poland who attempted to illegally enter Germany. Around half of them were Ukrainian, with the next largest national groups being Syrians and Afghans.

>The figures, provided by the German federal police to Polish news website Interia, come amid controversy in Poland over the return of migrants from Germany.

>Poland’s interior minister today reiterated that the German authorities have accepted that the [recent case of a family of Aghan asylum seekers](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/17/poland-demands-explanation-after-german-police-transport-migrant-family-back-over-border/) returned to Poland was carried out in violation of procedures. He said, if it happens again, the Polish government will consider introducing controls on its side of the German border.

>

>Interia notes that there are three circumstances in which Germany can return people to Poland. The first, under the EU’s Dublin Regulation, requires that those who have applied for asylum in an EU member state should remain there while it is processed.

>The second, known as “readmission” and stemming from a Polish-German agreement, means that people found to be illegally staying in Germany and who arrived there from Poland can be returned.

>In both such cases, Germany must inform Poland of any returns. The Polish border guard told Interia that, between the start of the year and 6 June, Germany returned 126 people under the Dublin Regulation and 164 based on readmission.

>

>However, far larger numbers have been sent back to Poland under a third set of circumstances, which are regular border controls (which Germany [reintroduced on the Polish border last year](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/09/23/germany-plans-controls-on-polish-and-czech-borders-to-curb-migration/) and has stepped up around the current European football championships that it is hosting).

>“If they find that a person cannot enter their territory, they simply turn them back,” Major Krzysztof Grzech from Poland’s border guard headquarters told Interia. “They don’t have to inform us about it.”

>Grzech notes that Poland does exactly the same thing when, for example, someone arrives at a Polish airport who is not allowed into the country. They are then sent back to the place they travelled from.

>In recent years Poland has also been [“pushing back” thousands of migrants](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/02/07/poland-publishes-data-on-thousands-of-migrant-pushbacks-at-belarus-border-for-first-time/) attempting to illegally cross its border from Belarus.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEUldyZEROZll3aEQ3M3kzZm9tci1iQklHWUZjYzNLM0JpSFJJaHJ0aXgwVVpQVGN4NGwxUDFIMi1MSG5YWmtYVFJ4YnFZdTFQYjdCeTBkUEs4cGRxT2c9PQ==
">Interia asked the German federal police how many people have been returned to Poland this year, and were told that the figure is 4,617. Among those, 2,292 were Ukrainians. The next largest groups were Syrians (350), Afghans (309), Georgians (213) and Indians (112).

>A spokeswoman for the German police, Franziska Gorski, told Interia that “countries from which illegal entry into German territory occurred or was attempted are obliged to take back persons who were refused entry to German territory…without any additional requirements and formalities”.

>She added that the German police aim to physically hand over people to the Polish authorities. “However, if this cannot be guaranteed for staffing, organisational or other reasons, refusal of entry is still permissible,” said Gorski.

>

>Earlier this month, a political storm broke out in Poland after CCTV footage showed German police transporting six Afghans over the border to Poland and then leaving them there.

>Poland’s interior minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, later said that German authorities had accepted that the incident was a “one-off mistake” and apologised for it.

>Speaking today to broadcaster Radio Zet, Siemoniak noted that a special Polish-German taskforce led by deputy ministers from both sides has been established to ensure that “nothing like this will ever happen again”.

">The Left (Lewica), which is part of Poland’s ruling coalition, has suspended one of its MPs after she launched an initiative in support of infrastructure development with a politician from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), Poland’s main opposition party. She is also facing disciplinary proceedings.

>The head of the group’s parliamentary caucus, Anna-Maria Żukowska, announced on Thursday afternoon her request to suspend Paulina Matysiak for “acting contrary to the interests of the caucus” had been accepted by the caucus’s presidium of leaders.

>

>Żukowska’s announcement came hours after Matysiak had published a video of herself and PiS MP Marcin Horała revealing that they had jointly launched a “social movement” that they called “Yes to Development”.

>The aim of the movement is “to connect citizens, organisations and politicians of various stripes supporting investments that are key to Poland’s development”, she wrote.

>More specifically, they want to “put disputes aside and work together on the construction of the CPK \\[the Solidarity Transport Hub, a planned major rail, road and airport project\\], nuclear power plants, the expansion of ports and the army”.

>

>Each of those projects were started under the former PiS government, which ruled Poland from 2015 until the end of last year, and there have been questions over whether and how they will continue under the new administration.

>Yesterday, Prime Minister Donald Tusk [confirmed that the planned CPK airport would go ahead](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/26/tusk-confirms-previous-governments-mega-airport-project-will-continue/), though some other elements of the project outlined previously under PiS would be changed.

>Under the PiS government, Horała was the official in charge of CPK while Matysiak has long been a vocal supporter of the project.

>

>As well as being suspended for three months from The Left’s parliamentary caucus, Matysiak also faces disciplinary action from Razem (Together), the party she belongs to and which is part of The Left.

>“Founding the association with Mr Horała is a private initiative of Paulina Matysiak, undertaken against the will of the Together authorities,” wrote the party in a statement on Thursday afternoon. “The Together party dissociates itself from this project. The party authorities were not informed about today’s joint speech with Horała.”

>“Due to the action, which we consider harmful to the party, the party management is submitting a request to the party peer court to initiate disciplinary proceedings,” they added.

>Krzysztof Gawkowski, a deputy prime minister and member of The Left, declared that the ruling coalition should not work with PiS, which “trampled on Polish democracy and the rule of law” when it was in power. Other figures from The Left pointed to PiS’s support for a near-total abortion ban and opposition to LGBT+ rights.

>

>Thus far, the PiS party has not commented on Horała’s involvement in the initiative with Matysiak. Speaking to broadcaster TVN, Horała defended their actions.

>“Politics does not have to look like an MMA fight or some frontline where people only shoot at each other or fight each other,” he said. “Sometimes you can also sit together and work for good causes for the country, if we agree on them.”

>“For example, The Left and I have different views on many issues, including abortion, LGBT and so on,” he continued. “But at the same time, we, as individuals, not as formations, can say: well, we disagree on many issues, but there are also some on which we agree.”",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFRWFFdXF6aUlWZkJkWGk5bjB3UTVzczU0UjFXd0djWUFldWlhTGRuaDlhLVVCNUtObFR2TU5wT1J3NU9IV3VzQkpPSTdTWHNyeF9URU1tNElfNjRJWGc9PQ==

">The government’s majority in parliament has voted to strip an opposition MP, Michał Woś, of legal immunity so that he can face prosecution for his role in the purchase of Pegasus spyware when he was part of the former Law and Justice (PiS) government.

>In a vote today, 240 members of the 460-seat Sejm approved the request to lift Woś’s immunity, which was submitted last month by prosecutor general Adam Bodnar, who also serves as justice minister.

>Bodnar wants Woś to face charges of abusing his power and abusing trust – crimes carrying a prison sentence of up to ten years – in relation to his use of a justice ministry fund to finance the purchase of Pegasus when he was a deputy minister.

>

>Today, all 240 votes for Woś’s immunity to be lifted came from the ruling coalition. The 192 against came from PiS itself as well as two other right-wing opposition groups, Confederation (Konfederacja) and Kukiz’15.

>Woś himself denies that he committed any crime and declared yesterday that he was a victim of “political repression” by the government.

>A politician from the ruling coalition, Bogdan Klich, however, responded to Woś’s claims of politician repression by quoting him the words of his former boss at the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, who said: “Honest people have nothing to fear.”

>

>The charges relate to a decision made in 2017 to transfer 25 million zloty from the Justice Fund to the Central Anticorruption Bureau (CBA) to finance the purchase of Pegasus, powerful Israel-made spyware that allows the harvesting of data from mobile devices.

>When requesting that Woś’s immunity be lifted, Bodnar said that those funds were transferred despite “it being known that the \\[CBA\\] did not meet the conditions for obtaining such financial support”. Woś therefore failed to fulfil his duties regarding managing public funds.

>In April, Bodnar revealed that hundreds of people had been surveilled using Pegasus during PiS’s time in power. Some of those targets were prominent opponents of the government, including the manager of the opposition’s election campaign in 2019.

>

>Separately an investigation set up by Bodnar has found what it claims are numerous irregularities in the disbursement of the Justice Fund, including its use for clearly political purposes. The fund is meant to be used by the justice ministry to support victims of crime, to prevent crime, and to rehabilitate criminals.

>As a result, Bodnar is also seeking to lift the immunity of another former deputy justice minister and now opposition MP, Marcin Romanowski. A vote on that issue is likely to take place next week.

>Both Woś and Romanowski are members of Sovereign Poland (Suwerenna Polska), a hard-right party led by Ziobro and which is allied with the national-conservative PiS,

It does not specify lack of consent as a criterion.

>The national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), which constitutes the main opposition group, was divided: 94 of its MPs voted in favour of changing the law, 26 were opposed while 47 abstained and 22 did not participate in the vote.

>

>During a debate on the bill yesterday, some MPs from Confederation and PiS argued that it would deprive men of the presumption of innocence and could be used by women to falsely accuse men of rape.

>“The new law is pure demagogy and de facto a gift for ruthless and vindictive women who will now be able to use this law to attack their former lovers,” said PiS MP Grzegorz Lorek, quoted by broadcaster TVN.

>“This bill introduces a de facto presumption of guilt, a presumption of guilt that every person accused of rape will have to prove that he or she is not a criminal,” added Witold Tumanowicz of Confederation.

>

>However, another PiS MP, Agnieszka Wojciechowska van Heukelom, declared that she supported the bill because “a woman’s will, a woman’s awareness when engaging in a sexual act is very important, so I am absolutely on the side of women”.

>Monika Rosa, an MP from the centrist Civic Coalition (KO), the main ruling group, said that “thousands of women have been waiting for this bill for years”. She declared that “a victim should not have to prove that they defended themselves when their body was used without their consent”.

>Having been approved by the Sejm, the bill now passes to the upper-house Senate, where the government also has a majority and which can in any case only delay and suggest amendments to legislation.

>Once passed by parliament, the bill goes to the desk of President Andrzej Duda, a conservative PiS ally, who can sign it into law, veto it, or pass it to the constitutional court for assessment.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFZDJCeDBEMjkwN01GcXBzWTdIQmdmeHJENkpyOTdUU0FpYnJESzhTckJVYUtEM051S1JHUkRSd2NqRzNwQi1EVW5mN1JaVFhwQzJRcHN0UUVzdnJwVFE9PQ==
">Poland’s top administrative court has rejected an appeal by former Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki against his conviction for ordering the organisation of elections by post during the pandemic in 2020. A lower court had [previously found](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/09/15/polish-prime-minister-committed-gross-violation-of-law-in-organising-elections-rules-court/) that he did so in “gross violation of the law”.

>The Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) was Morawiecki’s only avenue of appeal, meaning that he now has a final verdict against him.

>

>The issue dates back to spring 2020, when, during the first wave of the pandemic in Poland, the then Law and Justice (PiS) government [sought to organise](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/04/23/polands-postal-election-enveloped-in-confusion-as-government-pushes-ahead-before-legislation-passed/) that year’s presidential elections entirely by post.

>It argued that this was necessary due to the epidemiological situation. However, critics accused PiS of acting politically, because holding elections as quickly as possible would favour the PiS-backed incumbent Andrzej Duda, who was seeking a second term as president.

>They also claimed that the manner in which the government sought to organise those elections violated various laws. Those accusations have been supported by [court rulings](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/03/24/polish-government-unlawfully-shared-voters-data-while-preparing-election-rules-court/) as well as a [report by the state auditor](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/05/13/prime-minister-organised-postal-elections-without-legal-basis-says-polands-chief-auditor/).

Normal elections took place instead, and were narrowly won by Duda in a second-round run-off.

>

>The specific case on which the NSA has now ruled stems from a complaint against Morawiecki’s actions launched in April 2020 by Adam Bodnar, who was then Poland’s commissioner for human rights and is now justice minister and prosecutor general in the government that replaced PiS in December 2023.

>In a [ruling](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/09/15/polish-prime-minister-committed-gross-violation-of-law-in-organising-elections-rules-court/) issued by Warsaw’s provincial administrative court in September 2020, Morawiecki was found to have committed “a gross violation of the law” – including the constitution and the electoral code – in ordering the elections. He appealed to the NSA against that decision.

>Today, the NSA upheld the lower court’s verdict, confirming that only the National Electoral Commission (PKW) has legal competence to organise elections.

>“There was no substantive legal basis for issuing an order to Poczta Polska to undertake and implement activities aimed at preparing for the presidential elections,” said NSA judge Maciej Kobak, quoted by broadcaster TVN.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFb0VvWG1acjY4dm9KdldLTGJxcER5S1VHOTc5SmdYX0l5dzhkQjVVd0VBQlBWNDJZcTBhcFlfTVZzeXhHSUtVczNFMV81UkFHdHlCTFRKNVQwOTFNZEE9PQ==
">The ruling was welcomed by Bodnar, who told the *Gazeta Wyborcza* daily that “the situation we observed in April \\[2020\\], when the elections were organised, was a transgression of all the boundaries of the democratic rule of law and the principle of legalism”.

>However, in a statement issued on social media, Morawiecki – whose PiS party is now Poland’s main opposition – called the NSA’s decision “completely disconnected from \\[the reality of\\] those times and the threat that existed then”.

>He argued that as prime minister he had an obligation to try to organise elections in the safest possible way and that, had he not sought to do so, he would have faced legal action for endangering the health of citizens.

>

>Speaking to Notes from Poland after today’s ruling was issued, Patryk Wachowiec, a legal analyst at the Civic Development Forum (FOR), said that while it will not in itself have direct legal consequences, it could open the way for criminal and civil action against Morawiecki.

>“It has now been officially confirmed that Morawiecki’s decision to request that Poczta Polska \\[organise the elections\\] was illegal, so as a result Morawiecki could be held criminally responsible for misuse of power as prime minister,” said Wachowiec, who noted that prosecutors are already investigating the issue.

>“I also think there are grounds for civil claims by individuals whose data was unlawfully processed” as a result of Morawiecki’s decision, added Wachowiec.

>A [ruling](https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/03/24/polish-government-unlawfully-shared-voters-data-while-preparing-election-rules-court/) in a separate case in 2021 found that the government’s digital affairs ministry unlawfully transferred the personal data of Polish voters to the post office as part of efforts to organise the 2020 elections by post.

>After PiS lost its parliamentary majority in elections last year, the new ruling coalition approved the creation of a [special commission to investigate](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/12/08/polish-parliament-approves-investigation-into-abandoned-2020-postal-elections/) the abandoned postal elections.

>“In the autumn, Warsaw will be enriched with the QueerMuzeum – a grass-roots, open space for meetings with the history of the LGBTQ+ community,” wrote city hall on Friday, announcing the project.

>It says that the institution, which will be located in municipally owned premises on Marszałkowska Street at the heart of the city, will be only the third of its kind in Europe and the fifth in the world.

>“This museum is very important for Warsaw because it tells the story of Warsaw’s identity,” said deputy mayor Aldona Machnowska-Góra at the announcement, quoted by the *Gazeta Wyborcza* daily. “Warsaw is also a city with a queer history and a queer identity.”

>

>The museum will collect and share documents, artefacts and testimonies relating to the LGBT+ community. It will host the archives of Lambda, Poland’s oldest LGBT+ association, which contain around 100,000 items from the period 1945-2024.

>Among the objects on display will be the typewriter of Tadeusz Olszewski, a writer and activist in the Warsaw Homosexual Movement (WRH), a pioneering LGBT+ group that operated in communist Poland.

>Another item to feature will be the act of nomination to parliament of Anna Grodzka, who in 2011 became the first openly trans person in Europe elected to a national legislature.

>The museum will also host a plaque commemorating queer victims of the Second World War and it will organise Poland’s first public commemoration for those victims.

>

>The space in which the museum will operate already features a large, handmade rainbow flag sewn in 2005 for Warsaw’s planned first LGBT+ Equality Parade. However, the event was banned by the then mayor, Lech Kaczyński.

">Poland’s government has introduced a new, “slimmed-down” curriculum for the new school year. Its content has been reduced by one fifth, which the education ministry says will give teachers and students “more time for calmer and in-depth” learning.

>

>The ministry confirmed that the content of the curriculum has been reduced by around 20% overall and said that the material removed was “mainly content that is redundant at a given educational stage and impossible or very difficult to implement in practice”.

>“More attention was paid to developing practical skills instead of theoretical or encyclopaedic knowledge and to using digital tools and educational resources available on the internet in the teaching and learning process,” added the ministry.

>Much media attention has focused on changes to the compulsory reading list for children, with some classics of Polish literature, such as *The Deluge* by Henryk Sienkiewicz and *The Peasants* by Władysław Reymont, now only to be read in fragments rather than as a whole.

>Explaining the planned cuts last month, Nowacka told broadcaster Radio Zet that the previous reading list “was gigantic” and included some classic books that were so “thick” and filled with “archaic language” that students “reject them in their entirety”.

>The government’s changes to the curriculum, and especially the large cuts, have faced criticism from PiS, now the main opposition party, and also some experts.

>Piotr Müller, a former spokesman for the PiS government, accused the new government of “taking a razor” to the curriculum, which he said was being cut “without a coherent concept”, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP).

It is useful to economists in gauging whether industry is likely to grow or contract. A reading below 50 is seen as “pessimistic”, while one above 50 is “optimistic”.

">The US will lend Poland a further $2 billion (8.1 billion zloty) to fund the purchase of American air and missile defence systems, the Polish defence ministry has announced.

>

>It notes that such loans are available “only to selected US allies with whom the United States maintains close defense cooperation” and says the terms are “very favourable”, though without revealing the details.

>The air and missile defence systems that will be purchased through the agreement “are a priority for the Polish armed forces under current threats”, added the ministry.

>In February, Poland [signed a $2.5 billion deal](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/03/01/poland-signs-2-5bn-deal-with-us-for-air-defence-system/) with the US for an advanced air defence system and the US State Department also approved the [$1.2 billion sale to Poland](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/02/08/us-approves-1-2-billion-sale-of-military-airships-to-poland/) of four radar reconnaissance airships capable of detecting airborne targets.

">German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced during a visit to Warsaw that his country will offer support to surviving Polish victims of German-Nazi crimes and will help strengthen Poland’s eastern border. However, in both cases he did not provide details of what these measures would involve in practice.

>Scholz was visiting Poland along with his cabinet for the first Polish-Germany intergovernmental consultations since 2018, when his predecessor Angela Merkel was in power and Poland was led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party.

>PiS, which is now in opposition, has criticised Scholz’s offer of support for Polish war victims as “scraps” compared to the [$1.3 trillion in reparations](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/08/31/congressman-calls-for-us-to-support-polands-war-reparations-claim-against-germany/) that Poland claimed from Germany in 2022 when PiS was in office.

>

>“We, the Germans, caused Poland immense suffering during World War II,” said Scholz, speaking alongside Tusk after their meeting. “Germany is aware of its guilt and the tasks resulting from this…Germany will try to provide support to survivors of the occupation.”

>Scholz, however, did not provide any details of what form that support would take, who would be eligible, or how much would be spent on it. Between 1992 and 2005, Germany already provided compensation to Polish victims of German-Nazi crimes through the Foundation for Polish-German Reconciliation.

>According to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), around 40,000 Polish remaining survivors of the war could benefit from any additional German support.

>When asked for more information by a journalist, Scholz said simply that “we are working on it with the Polish government; support for the elderly is very important to us and we will act in this area”.

>

>Tusk, meanwhile, said that he was “not disappointed with the gesture of the German government, because there is no amount of money that would compensate for what happened during World War Two”.

>“If we hear today that Germany is ready to make a decision to compensate the living victims of the war…then these are steps in the right direction,” he added.

>The Polish prime minister also welcomed the fact that the German government last week [gave its approval](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/27/german-government-approves-memorial-in-berlin-for-polish-wwii-victims/) to the creation of an institution in Berlin that will commemorate Polish victims of the war.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHbGc3X1cwazVub1BlSTBSZ0N0NVRFRUd1cTlwRDFpOEZfRXQ2bTJOUDVMNUlUemVnMkVqQTJDclg0ZllnbGNFQXd3RHgtSnktb1ljSVMwSGptX3otMGc9PQ==
">During the two leaders’ remarks, Scholz also declared that Germany “wants to take on the role of a leader in NATO in protecting the eastern flank and the Baltic region”.

>“The security of Germany and Poland are inextricably linked – Poland’s security is Germany’s security,” said the chancellor. He promised to boost “cooperation in the field of security and defence” as well as to continue providing support to Ukraine.

>Tusk, meanwhile, declared that “no nations should feel as responsible for the security and protection of Europe from external aggression as the Polish and German nations”.

>“Poland, as one of the greatest victims of World War Two, Germany as the perpetrators of the tragedy of World War II, today as free, democratic, European nations, should jointly and effectively ensure that Europe is safe, so that the tragedy of war is never repeated on our lands,” he added.

>Ahead of Scholz’s visit – when media reports suggested that he would announce support for Polish victims of the war – PiS figures dismissed the offer as insufficient.

>“We will not be satisfied with any scraps, any attempts to cover up this topic with some small amounts or small actions on the part of the German government,” said Jacek Sasin, who served as deputy prime minister in the PiS government, ahead of Scholz’s visit.

>Stanisław Żaryn, who also served in the PiS government and is now an advisor to PiS-aligned President Andrzej Duda, likewise told news website wPolityce ahead of the visit that he “fears Olaf Scholz has indeed brought some scraps to Poland”.

">**A Kazakh opposition journalist has died of his wounds two weeks after being shot in Kyiv in an attack that his wife has linked to the Kazakh regime.**

>Known for his YouTube channel Base, Aydos Sadykov had been living in Ukraine since 2014 after being granted asylum. Using his channel to criticize the Kazakh President, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Sadykov and his wife, Natalia, had long been viewed as enemies of the state.

>Shot while driving in the center of Kyiv on June 18, Sadykov was pronounced dead earlier today. Writing on Facebook, his wife laid the blame squarely at the feet of Tokayev.

>She said: “Aydos Sadykov passed away today at 3 a.m. Kyiv time (2 a.m. in Poland). My beloved husband, father of our three children, great son of the Kazakh nation.”

>She added: “Aydos gave his life for Kazakhstan and died a martyr's death at the hands of assassins.

>“For thirteen days, Ajdos fought for his life in the intensive care unit, but no miracle happened. His death weighs on Tokayev's conscience.”

>A manhunt was immediately launched for two suspects named by the opposition portal [Vlast.kz](http://Vlast.kz) as Altai Zhatkanbayev and Meiram Karataev.

>According to the portal, the two hitmen entered Ukraine on June 2 and immediately began to tail Sadykov.

>After ambushing him, the two men then fled to Moldova.

>Subject to an international wanted notice, Zhatkanbayev was reportedly arrested on June 22 after handing himself over to authorities in his home country. Meanwhile, Karataev remains at large.

>However, while President Tokayev originally promised that Kazakh law enforcement would cooperate with their Ukrainian counterparts, the Chairman of the Senate, Maulen Ashimbayev, has refused to extradite Zhatkanbayev, calling this refusal “a matter of state principle.”

>Ashimbayev also denied that the execution had been ordered by Kazakhstan.

>**Who was Aydos Sadykov?** 

>Regarded as Kazakhstan’s highest-profile exiles, Sadykov and his wife frequently fell foul of authorities. Once heading a regional branch of the opposition party Azat, Sadykov was placed in a psychiatric unit in 2003 after officials accused him of “insanity.”

>In 2010, he was imprisoned for two years on charges of hooliganism. Despite CCTV showing that he had been attacked by the police, a judge ruled that it was Sadykov that was guilty of assault.

>Fleeing in 2014 after a warrant was issued for the arrest of Natalia Sadykov, the couple found refuge in Kyiv. However, the past continued to haunt them, and in 2018, a group of unidentified men burst into their apartment and demanded they stop making anti-Kazakh posts on their YouTube channel.

>Last October, Sadykov was added to Kazakhstan’s wanted list for “inciting hatred.” His final video, titled “the President of Kazakhstan has become a puppet of agents of Russian influence,” was published on the day he was shot.

>Yermak’s visit came in the run-up to a July 9-11 NATO summit in Washington, where Ukraine is expected to be a central topic.

>Trump, the Republican nominee challenging President Joe Biden, suggested in a recent debate that he could swiftly resolve the conflict if re-elected in November, though he did not specify how.

>Reports indicated Trump’s advisers had proposed a strategy involving the threat of cutting U.S. aid unless Kyiv entered into negotiations with Moscow.

>Yermak responded cautiously when asked about Trump’s approach, saying: “Honest answer: I don’t know. Let’s see.”

>He affirmed that Ukraine intended to press for continued U.S. support under a potential new administration, adding that there was bipartisan backing in Washington and enduring American public support for Kyiv after years of conflict.

>**‘One phone call’ to solve the crisis**

>Finnish President Alexander Stubb also suggested that the war could be ended in swift fashion.

>In an interview with the Bloomberg news agency, Stubb said that Moscow’s dependence on China had reached a level where Beijing could use its influence to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

>“Russia is now very dependent on China,” Stubb said. “One phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis.”

>“If he \\[Xi Jinping\\] were to say, ‘Time to start negotiating peace,’ Russia would be forced to do that. They would have no other choice,” Stubb added.

>Figures associated with PiS have accused the authorities of violating judicial independence. However, prosecutors note that their activities have nothing to do with the KRS itself but are rather aimed at securing documentation from officials who occupy premises in the same building.

>The situation has resulted in a standoff, with the head of the KRS saying that she does not give permission for the police and prosecutors to enter the premises.

>

>Shortly after 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning, the KRS announced that a prosecutor accompanied by police had entered their building unannounced and was demanding access to documentation belonging to judicial disciplinary officers.

>Anna Adamiak, a spokeswoman for Adam Bodnar, who serves as both prosecutor general and justice minister, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that there had been no attempt to enter the headquarters of the KRS itself, only premises that the KRS rents to the disciplinary officers.

>She noted that the attempt to secure documentation from those premises was part of criminal proceedings relating to allegations that the three disciplinary officials had exceeded their powers. It “absolutely does not concern the activities and functioning of the KRS”, she added.

>

>*Gazeta Wyborcza*, a leading liberal daily, reports that the criminal proceedings against the trio relate to the fact that they have refused to hand over case files to new disciplinary officials appointed by Bodnar to replace them.

>Adamiak also told PAP that Schab, Radzik and Lasota had continued to conduct proceedings despite their powers expiring after Bodnar had appointed replacements. She insisted that today’s action by police and prosecutors was taking place “legally and legitimately”.

>However, Radzik told conservative news website wPolityce that they “do not want to release these documents due to formal deficiencies in the application for their release”.

>Schab said that the authorities were undertaking “criminal and thuggish actions” with “absolutely no legal basis” that were timed to take advantage of the fact he is currently on holiday. “This is Bolshevism,” he added.

>

>Meanwhile, two opposition MPs – former deputy justice minister Sebastian Kaleta and Dariusz Matecki – arrived at the KRS to express their opposition to the actions of the authorities.

>They fear this will lead to the demise of many smaller outlets and force some to hide their content behind a paywall.

>The publishers have called on the Senate, which is currently considering the legislation, to add an amendment – previously rejected by the lower-house Sejm – guaranteeing that the state will stand in as mediator if a media outlet and tech firm fail to agree on what the latter should pay the former for its content.

>According to the bill passed in Sejm, the rules and the level of remuneration are to be agreed between publishers and tech companies.

>The Left (Lewica), one of the members of the ruling coalition, had proposed an amendment ensuring that the state would step in to mediate in contentious cases. That proposal was also supported by the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), the main opposition party.

>The amendment provided that if no agreement is reached within three months of a request to start negotiations, the parties could apply to Poland’s consumer protection authority, UOKiK, for mediation. If mediation was not successful within three months, UOKIK’s president would set the terms of compensation.

">Poland’s defence ministry had threatened legal action against an opposition-aligned media outlet that reported alleged plans to cut the defence budget by a quarter. The ministry says the story is false and suggests that Russia could be behind it. But opposition MPs claim to have confirmed it is genuine.

>On Thursday morning, TV Republika, a conservative broadcaster strongly critical of the government, claimed to have obtained a document indicating that there were plans to reduce defence spending by around 25% for the period 2025 to 2028.

>Journalist Piotr Nisztor published extracts from what he said was a letter sent by the general staff of the Polish armed forces to the defence ministry expressing opposition to the proposal.

>Neither he nor TV Republika indicated the source of the document and the extracts they published do not contain any information that could confirm its authenticity, such as a date or signature, notes broadcaster Polsat News.

>

>When contacted by TV Republika about the claim, defence minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz denied it. He said that not only were no spending cuts planned, but that in fact the defence budget may be increased.

>Poland is this year spending the equivalent of over 4.1% of GDP on defence, which is the [highest level among all NATO countries](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/19/poland-to-be-natos-biggest-defence-spender-this-year-as-proportion-of-gdp/). It is also an increase on the 3.9% of GDP spent last year by the former Law and Justice (PiS) government, which is now in opposition.

>In a further statement issued later in the morning, the defence ministry “firmly denied” TV Republika’s “completely baseless” claims. It accused the outlet of “irresponsibly and harmfully” spreading “unverified and false information” that could “affect the sense of public security and create unnecessary chaos”.

>“The defence ministry does not plan any budget cuts amounting to 57 billion zloty \\[as claimed by TV Republika\\]. In fact, we plan to increase our military budget by 10% next year as part of a long-term national security strategy to strengthen our armed forces in the face of current geopolitical threats.”",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNOWFduMXJZc0lCVktMQ05zOGxKXzhrYXpObl8wNU1nSlh1ZllxZEo2c2Nudi1fRHAwRW50QkczUzVPTFN3ZEJLcEt5Y0lKNHE5ejJGb2w3bExjSWx4YVE9PQ==
">The ministry said that it “demands immediate correction of false information by TV Republika” and that “if no correction is made, we will consider taking appropriate legal steps to protect the good name of the defence ministry and prevent further spread of disinformation”.

>“Moreover, questions arise about possible foreign inspirations, including Russian, that may be behind these actions,” it added. “We want to know on whose behalf the authors of these false reports acted and what their motivations were.”

>Meanwhile, finance minister Andrzej Domański tweeted that “defence spending is our priority” and that “next year it will increase not only nominally, but also in relation to GDP”.

>Despite those denials, PiS politicians expressed anger at the reported cuts. Mateusz Morawiecki, who served as prime minister from 2017 until the end of last year, said that “if the reports are confirmed, it will mean a huge blow to Poland’s security”.

>“Poles expect explanations. Immediately,” he wrote.

>Meanwhile, former PiS defence minister Mariusz Błasczak called the alleged plans “sabotage by the Tusk government”, referring to Prime Minister Donald Tusk.

>In response, deputy defence minister Cezary Tomczyk called Błaszczak “a hypocrite, a liar and an irresponsible person”. He said PiS was acting “no differently from the Russian trolls who attack the Polish army and the defence ministry every day”.

>Błaszczak, in turn, replied that PiS MPs “have proven that the document on budget cuts is true” and said that he was filing a motion to prosecutors accusing Tomczyk of defamation.

>Błaszczak’s remarks referred to claims by three PiS MPs, Andrzej Śliwka, Paweł Jabłoński and Michał Moskal, who today visited the defence ministry and requested to see the documents in question.

">Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party has confirmed it will remain in the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) alongside the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party of Giorgia Meloni. In doing so, it has resisted overtures from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán to join the new Patriots for Europe alliance he is creating.

>The national-conservative PiS, which ruled Poland from 2015 to the end of last year and is now in opposition, came [second in last month’s European elections in Poland](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/06/10/six-conclusions-from-polands-european-elections/). Its 36% of the vote translated into 20 seats in the European Parliament (EP), down from the 27 it won in 2019.

>That made it the second-largest party in the ECR, which is one of the umbrella groups that bring together like-minded parties from various countries in the EP. The largest member of the ECR is Meloni’s FdI, which won 24 seats last month.

>

>Other groups that currently belong to the ECR include Spain’s Vox and the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), which both have six seats.

>Across the European Union as a whole, the ECR finished third in last month’s elections, winning 12.2% of the vote, which translated into 84 seats, up 4 percentage points and 22 seats on 2019.

>However, since the elections, a new force on the right and far right has emerged, with Orbán’s Fidesz launching the Patriots for Europe initiative alongside ANO – the party of former Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš – and Austria’s Freedom Party (FPÖ). Portugal’s Chega also later joined

>

>Those four parties together have 26 MEPs. To be recognised in the EP, a group is required to have at least 23 MEPs who must come from at least one quarter of member states (currently meaning seven). Patriots for Europe meets the first threshold but not yet the second.

>PiS had been seen as a potential candidate to join the group, given its longstanding close relations with Fidesz. However, those ties have been [frayed since 2022](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/07/30/the-paths-of-poland-and-hungary-have-diverged-says-polish-pm/) due to the parties’ strongly different positions on Russia and its war in Ukraine.

">Last week, Morawiecki told *Politico Europe* that it was “50/50” as to whether PiS would stay in the ECR or instead seek to form a “geographical platform” with other parties in the region such a Fidesz, ANO and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS).

>Many commentators suspected such talk was merely a negotiating tactic to strengthen PiS’s position in talks with the FdI. And on Wednesday this week, PiS confirmed it was sticking with the ECR during a meeting of the group in Sicily.

>“The decision has been made: we are staying in the ECR,” one of its MEPs, Kosma Złotowski, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). He has taken the position of co-treasurer alongside FdI’s Denis Nesci. Another senior PiS figure, Joachim Brudziński, is becoming co-chair alongside FdI’s Nicola Procaccini.

>Meanwhile, reports suggest that Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN) has been in talks to join Patriots for Europe. That could precipitate the collapse of the far-right Identity and Democracy (ID) group – which is currently dominated by RN and Matteo Salvini’s Lega – with its members absorbed into Patriots for Europe.

>As a result of such changes, Patriots for Europe could eventually form an official group in the EP with around 95 MEPs, reports Euractiv, making it larger than the ECR.

">Poland’s state broadcaster, TVP, has deleted an article from its website that found Prime Minister Donald Tusk to have made “misleading” accusations against the opposition.

>On Thursday, news channel TVP Info published an article fact-checking a claim made by Tusk on Wednesday that in 2006 Anna Fotyka, the foreign minister in a Polish government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, had “signed a document on Poland’s waiver of \\[war\\] reparations \\[from Germany\\]”.

>The prime minister made that claim in response to criticism from PiS – which is now Poland’s main opposition party – that during a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday Tusk had failed to push for war reparations from Germany.

>TVP Info’s article – titled “Fotyga ‘signed a document on Poland’s waiver of reparations’? No, we explain” – branded Tusk’s claim as “misleading” and a “manipulation”.

>

>“The foreign minister in \\[PiS Prime Minister\\] Jarosław Kaczyński’s \\[2006\\] government did not sign any document ‘on Poland’s waiver of reparations’,” wrote TVP Info. “The authorities at the time did not make any binding decisions in this matter.”

>However, soon after being published, the post on TVP Info’s X account linking to the article was deleted. Then the article itself disappeared before reappearing in “much softer” form, observed Patryk Słowik, a journalist from news website Wirtualna Polska.

>Finally, the article was deleted again and remains offline. Google searches and the Wayback Machine, an internet archive, still show the historical existence of the article but the link is now dead and redirects users to TVP Info’s homepage.

>TVP Info has neither acknowledged the fact that the article was deleted nor explained why it happened.

">Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk have met in Warsaw, where the pair signed a security agreement between their two countries.

>The document includes measures on training a “Ukrainian legion” in Poland and sets out plans for shooting down Russian missiles and drones over Ukraine that are heading towards Polish airspace.

>At the end of June, Tusk revealed that he would meet with Zelensky before the NATO summit in Washington, which will start tomorrow. However, the fact that the meeting would take place in Warsaw today was only announced this morning.

>Tusk praised Zelensky’s “perseverance and courage” and pledged that he “can always count on us in…the fight for a safe Ukraine and a safe Europe”.

>“The heroic defence of Ukraine is also the defence of the entire free world,” said Tusk, speaking alongside Zelensky. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is also an attack on Ukraine’s friends and neighbours…If this war ended badly, it would also end badly for Poland and the entire Western world.”

>Poland is the latest in a series of countries to sign security agreements with Ukraine, pledging to maintain long-term support for Kyiv’s defence against Russian aggression. Last month, the United States and Japan became the 16th and 17th countries to sign such deals.

>“Every word in this document means something and these words will have practical consequences,” declared Tusk, who also pledged that Poland would “continue to persuade our allies to make the path towards joining both the EU and NATO as quick as possible for Ukraine”.

>

>Zelensky likewise hailed the deal as “a very important agreement, a momentous agreement, an ambitious agreement that will greatly help us protect the lives of our citizens and counteract Russian evil”.

>The Ukrainian president noted that Poland has already made 44 transfers of military equipment to Ukraine, with several more due by the end of this year. He added that talks had taken place regarding the further transfer of Polish aircraft.

>Zelensky also revealed that the security agreement has “formalised the formation and training of the Ukrainian Legion, a new volunteer military unit, on Polish territory”. It “will be trained in Poland and equipped by our partners”.

>“The training will allow the exchange of experience, coordination between Belarusian and Chinese units, \\[and\\] create a foundation for further development of Belarusian-Chinese relations in the field of joint training of troops,” they added.

>China’s defence ministry confirmed on Sunday that the exercises, titled “Eagle Assault”, would take place around Brest, which sits right on the border with Poland.

>They will involve “hostage rescue operations and counter-terrorism missions” aimed at “enhancing training levels and coordination capabilities, as well as deepening practical cooperation between the armies of the two countries”, reports Chinese state news agency Xinhua.

Afterwards, Duda hailed Polish-Chinese relations and said that he was “very happy that President \\[Xi\\] calls me a friend”.

>On Friday, Vladimir Kupriyanyuk, the deputy head of the general staff of Belarus’s armed forces, suggested that the exercises are a response to a buildup of NATO forces in the region.

>“The current situation around Belarus continues to develop under the influence of negative factors caused by the aggressive foreign policy of the West towards the Union State of Belarus and Russia,” said Kupriyanyuk.

>“In these conditions, in the western direction, directly at our borders, we see a systematic deployment of NATO coalition soldiers,” he added, quoted by Polish news website Interia.

>Anton Gerashchenko, a former deputy interior minister of Ukraine, called the Chinese-Belarusian exercise “alarming news, not only for Ukraine”.

>By holding “a military exercise in Europe, on the border with NATO, Beijing thereby sends a signal to Washington and demonstrates its readiness to use the military infrastructure and territory of Belarus”, wrote Gerashchenko on X.

">Poland is looking at the possibility of sending electricity generated by Polish power stations using Polish coal to Ukraine this winter, as its neighbour faces an energy crisis caused by Russian attacks against its infrastructure.

>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who [met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/07/08/zelensky-and-tusk-sign-polish-ukrainian-security-agreement-in-warsaw/), said that his government is working to ensure that Poland can burn its coal for this purpose without incurring emissions charges, and that the electricity produced is sent “for European money” to Ukraine.

>His announcement prompted criticism from parts of the right-wing opposition, which accused Tusk of putting the needs of Ukraine above those of Poles, who stand to face high energy bills this winter.

>

>“Our people are discussing how we can directly help supply Ukraine with electricity before winter,” said Tusk yesterday during a joint press conference with Zelensky.

>“We are currently working on being able to burn Polish coal, which we have a lot of at the moment, in a way that we won’t have to pay for burning this coal and for \\[carbon\\] emissions, and to send the electricity generated by Polish power plants from Polish coal for European money via the existing energy bridge to Ukraine,” he added.

>Last year, Poland and Ukraine [opened a 400 kilovolt (kV) “energy bridge”](https://notesfrompoland.com/2023/01/11/poland-and-ukraine-to-open-energy-bridge-linking-electricity-grids/) linking their electricity grids.

>Tusk said he would urge his European partners to “look for creative ideas” to support Ukraine’s energy sector after Russia recently stepped up its attacks on infrastructure. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has lost more than half of its power generation capacity, reported the *Financial Times* last month.

>

>Tusk’s announcement sparked criticism from some opposition politicians, who accused him of putting the interests of foreign countries above those of Poles.

>“Another negotiating success from Donald Tusk! After agreeing to no war reparations from Germany, today he has agreed to produce electricity from Polish coal for Ukraine free of charge,” said Ewa Zajączkowska-Hernik, Confederation’s spokeswoman.

>She was referring to Tusk’s recent comments indicating that his government [would not continue the push for reparations ](https://notesfrompoland.com/2024/07/08/majority-of-poles-want-government-to-seek-war-reparations-from-germany/)from Germany started under the previous Law and Justice (PiS) administration.

>

>Janusz Kowalski, an MP from the caucus of PiS, which is Poland’s main opposition, criticised Tusk for seeking to suspend ETS payments for electricity for Ukraine but not for Poland’s own electricity generation, something PiS wants.

>“PiS is calling for the suspension of the EU ETS for Poland, while Tusk wants to suspend the EU ETS in Poland in the interests not of Poland, but of…Ukraine,” said Kowalski on X. “For seven months \\[since taking power\\], Tusk has not uttered a word at the EU forum about the suspension of the EU ETS for Poland.”",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRYS1IcGNrV19ZbXlRamhncUN5WnREb0Z5MFhpR0JjemIwT2pJQjhGUUxCdklTUnRMRWNCTHJVY042NkMwZlBmdTI5QjdZUk1Oei03YzJRME5SXzdyTlE9PQ==
">A bill introducing same-sex civil partnerships in Poland has been added to the government’s agenda. The legislation, which would also introduce the same right for opposite-sex couples, still faces a number of hurdles – including divisions within the ruling coalition and a potential presidential veto – to become law.

>A notification regarding the bill was published on the government website on Monday. It notes that the legislation aims to implement a European Court of Human Rights ruling issued in December that found Poland’s lack of legal recognition and protection for same-sex couples violates their human rights.


>But even before that ruling was issued, parties that make up most of the ruling coalition that won a majority at October’s parliamentary elections had pledged to introduce same-sex civil partnerships once they came to power.

>However, some conservative elements within the government – in particular the agrarian Polish People’s Party (PSL) – have been resistant towards the idea, resulting in lengthy negotiations before the draft bill was announced yesterday.

>The legislation would allow both opposite-sex and same-sex couples to form legally registered partnerships. The justification on the government’s website notes that the number of unmarried cohabiting couples rose from 316,500 at the time of the 2011 census to 552,800 a decade later.

>“There is undoubtedly a social need to increase the legal protection of families created by same-sex and different-sex couples who do not marry,” reads the justification.



>The proposed law would allow any two unmarried adults, regardless of their gender, to enter a registered partnership at a registry office. This would provide them with enhanced rights and obligations relating to taxation, healthcare, inheritance and alimony.

>These include, among others, statutory inheritance upon a partner’s death, exemption from inheritance and gift taxes, and the possibility to cover a partner with health insurance and to represent them before public offices and courts.

>However, Maja Heban from Miłość Nie Wyklucza, a leading LGBT+ rights organisation, told the Polish Press Agency (PAP) that they were disappointed that some “key issues are missing” from the legislation, including the right for one partner in a same-sex couple to legally adopt the child of the other partner.

>“Some form of civil partnerships, of course, will be better than no solution at all,” said Heban. “But as long as rainbow families are simply not protected and children are left in a legal vacuum, we will have to continue to protest.”



>The notification on the government’s website estimates that approval of the bill by the cabinet will take place in the fourth quarter of this year. In the meantime, inter-ministerial discussions and public consultations will take place.

>Once approved by the cabinet, the bill passes to parliament, where the government has a majority in both chambers. But MPs may be given the freedom to vote with their conscience rather than follow the party line. That could result in some more conservative members of the coalition voting against it.

>The ruling coalition currently has 247 MPs in the 460-seat Sejm, the more powerful lower house of parliament. Given that the conservative opposition is unlikely to vote for same-sex partnerships, that means the government would require almost all of its MPs to support the bill.

>On Monday, Katarzyna Pełczyńska-Nałęcz, a government minister, told broadcaster TVN that talks were taking place with PSL in an effort to ensure a majority for the bill.


>If passed by parliament, the legislation moves on to President Andrzej Duda, a conservative opponent of the government. He can sign the bill into law, veto it, or send it to the constitutional court for assessment.

>Four years ago, while campaigning for a second term, Duda indicated he would “seriously consider signing a bill” registered partnerships. However, in January this year, his chief of staff said that “the president does not support civil partnerships”.

>A poll last month by IBRiS for Rzeczpospolita, a leading newspaper, found that almost two thirds (63%) of Poles are in favour of introducing civil partnerships. A poll in April by United Surveys for Dziennik Gazeta Prawna and RMF FM produced an almost identical result of 66% support.

Until now, many have remained outside the Polish education system, often instead learning remotely with Ukrainian teachers.

>“We are doing our best to make Polish schools as prepared as possible \\[to receive more Ukrainian students\\],” said education minister Barbara Nowacka in an interview with Polskie Radio.

>She noted that estimates “vary greatly” on how many Ukrainian children in Poland are currently outside the education system, ranging between 70,000 and 180,000. Currently there are around 100,000 Ukrainian refugee children attending Polish schools, she added.

>“Polish teachers have taken a very responsible approach to the task during the refugee crisis,” said the minister. “I know that this is the way they would approach it now as well, but we want to support them, so we are training and preparing intercultural assistants.”

>“We had to make this difficult decision to enforce compulsory education,” added Nowacka. “These children have been studying online for four years – first because of the pandemic and then the war…As a state, we have a duty to provide a good level of education. We cannot allow children not to be able to read and write.”

>The intercultural assistants will tasked with helping pupils who do not have a sufficient level of Polish. They would also be expected to coordinate between the parents of foreign students and the school, reports education news service Portal Oświatowy.

>Many Polish schools have already employed assistants to help non-Polish children, especially after large numbers of Ukrainian refugees began arriving in 2022.

He called on his supporters to “take various types of action…in defence of Poland”.

>Kaczyński was addressing the crowd today at a rally organised in defence of Michał Olszewski, a priest currently being held in pre-trial detention as part of an investigation into the alleged corrupt use of state funds under the PiS government. Olszewski claims to have been tortured. The prison service denies this.

>Kaczyński said that Olszewski’s treatment is just one example of “constant violation of the law” by Tusk’s government, which replaced Kaczyński’s national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party in power in December.

>“These are not acts of madness,” he added, but “part of a well-planned action…to pacify our society because, after all, the plan which Tusk was sent here to implement is a plan, the finale of which is to be, in fact, the liquidation of the Polish state.”

>“Not in the sense that Poland will disappear from the map, that someone will partition it, that there will be no Polish state bodies, parliament, government, or local authorities,” Kaczyński clarified. “Only that all important decisions will be made outside, we will be an area inhabited by Poles but managed from outside.”",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXOEtWNEtLdXhWbGkzS1JrYXFrcy1Yc2ZDcjBWTVYxYnhOMU9KUF9vTkdDOTdrS2JxNWlKNEZDWU9aVTVfSWs4dV9jek90OWhiZThra2hkSGp0anJ4UEE9PQ==
">As examples of steps Tusk’s government has taken to implement that alleged plan, Kaczyński noted how it had first seized control of public media in order “to prevent millions of Poles from having access to true information” and then removed the national prosecutor.

>Kaczyński said that, while he was encouraged by the turnout at today’s event, “demonstrations, even very large ones, do not change the situation”. Warsaw city hall, which is controlled by Tusk’s Civic Platform (PO), estimated the number of participants at around 4,500.

>“What is happening today is a pacification operation and we must put an end to it with various types of actions,” Kaczyński declared. “We must act against what is happening in the name of defending Poland, democracy, the rule of law and ordinary human decency. We must unite.”

>“Remember that, if the government is capable of torture, it is capable of rigging elections,” continued Kaczyński, who did not specify what kinds of actions he wanted to be taken.

>

>Since losing power last year, Kaczyński and PiS have regularly accused Tusk’s government of violating the rule of law and of acting in foreign interests, especially Germany’s. In January, he likened Tusk to Hitler and accused him of wanting to turn Poles into “farmhands for Germany”.

>Some legal experts have also questioned the validity of some of the actions of Tusk’s government, including its takeover of public media, elements of which have also been rejected by courts.

>Observers have also noted that, since the takeover, public media have gone from producing PiS propaganda to now showing a strong bias towards Tusk’s government, in violation of their statutory obligation to be neutral.

>

>PiS itself, during its time in power, was found to have violated the law by a number of Polish and European court rulings. Its eight-year rule also saw Poland fall dramatically in international rankings of democracy, media freedom and the rule of law.

>When Tusk took office, his coalition pledged to restore democracy and the rule of law in Poland. The European Union has praised his government for doing so.

>On Wednesday afternoon, Stanisław Tyszka confirmed that he and two other Confederation MEPs, Ewa Zajączkowska-Hernik (pictured above left) and Marcin Sypniewski, are joining the new “Europe of Sovereign Nations” group.

>Tyszka admitted that “sometimes we differ” from other members of the group. But “we have a lot in common”, including “opposing the EU’s crazy climate policy, the immigration policy that threatens the stability of our countries and Europe, and attempts to build a European superstate”.

>“We decided that, in order to fight for Poland’s interests in the European Parliament more effectively, it is better to create a group than to remain unaffiliated,” he added.

>The Sovereignists, as the group will also be known, is dominated by the AfD, which had 15 MEPs elected last month, meaning it holds more than half of the reported 28 MEPs currently set to join the group, which will be the smallest in the new EP.

>Other members include Spain’s Se Acabó La Fiesta (SALF) and Bulgaria’s Revival, which provide three MEPs each, as well as France’s Reconquête, the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), Hungary’s Our Homeland Movement (MHM), Slovakia’s Republic Movement and Lithuania’s People and Justice Union.

>The three Polish MEPs joining the Sovereignists all come from one of the groups that make up the Confederation alliance. Their right-wing libertarian New Hope (Nowa Nadzieja) party, led by Sławomir Mentzen, was founded by (and previously named after) former MEP Janusz Korwin-Mikke.

>However, two MEPs who come from the National Movement (Ruch Narodowy), a nationalist element of Confederation, have refused to join the Sovereignists.

>The pair, Tomasz Buczek and Anna Bryłka (pictured above right), are reportedly in negotiations with another new group, Patriots for Europe, recently set up by Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party and subsequently joined by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN).

>Bryłka did not specify which statements she was referring to. But various comments by leading AfD figures downplaying Nazi crimes have provoked particular anger in Poland, which suffered enormously under German occupation during the Second World War.

>PiS MEP Arkadiusz Mularczyk said that it was “shocking” that some Confederation MEPs had agreed to join with the AfD. “I only hope that they will educate their German colleagues about the history of World War Two,” he told the Niezależna news website.

>Robert Biedroń, an MEP and one of the leaders of The Left (Lewica), accused the Confederation trio of “fraternising with neo-fascists who need to be cordoned off”.

>German daily *Die Welt* reported that the AfD did not invite Braun to join the Sovereignists because they did not want to be associated with him due to his statements on the Holocaust. Braun has a long history of antisemitic rhetoric and Holocaust revisionism.

>The [text of the agreement](https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/polsko-ukrainskie-porozumienie-w-dziedzinie-bezpieczenstwa) does not specifically mention such a legion, but it does say that, as part of Poland’s training of Ukrainian military personnel, “Ukrainian nationals temporarily residing in Poland and other states will be able to participate”.

>It also says that “Poland, at the request of Ukraine, will encourage Ukrainian citizens to return to Ukraine to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and other security and defence forces”.

>Speaking today, Sikorski said that “in Poland, we are starting to prepare the first Ukrainian brigade of volunteers”, reports the Polish Press Agency (PAP). The Polish authorities will provide training and equipment to the volunteers, who would be allowed to return to Poland after serving in Ukraine, he added.

>“We have \\[in Poland\\] up to 1 million Ukrainians of both sexes, and several thousand of them have already registered to take part in this undertaking,” he added. “If every European country did this, Ukraine would have several brigades.”

>In February this year, Poland’s state Office for Foreigners (UdSC) published figures showing that there remain around 950,000 Ukrainian refugees in the country, half of them children. There are also an additional half million or so Ukrainian migrants with residence permits in Poland.

">The government’s majority in parliament has voted to strip an opposition MP, Marcin Romanowski, of immunity so he can be charged with 11 alleged crimes relating to his time as a deputy justice minister in the former Law and Justice (PiS) government. It has also consented for him to be placed in pretrial detention.

>The decision follows last month’s decision to strip Michał Woś, another opposition MP and former justice minister, of immunity as part of efforts by the government that took power from PiS in December to investigate alleged corruption in the disbursement of a justice ministry fund.

>However, Romanowski, like Woś, claims to be the victim of “political repression” and “unlawful actions” by the new administration.

>

>In June, prosecutor general Adam Bodnar, who also serves as justice minister, requested that Romanowski be stripped of immunity. He said there was “a sufficiently justified suspicion” that Romanowski committed offences, including participation in an organised criminal group, having crime as a source of income, and abuse of power.

>As well as seeking to bring charges against Romanowski, Bodnar also asked for him to be placed in pretrial detention due to concern that he would seek to “unlawfully obstruct proceedings”.

">Two votes on Romanowski were held today. In the first, on whether to strip him of immunity from prosecution, there were 250 votes in favour and 178 against.

>Those in favour came from the four groups that make up the ruling coalition – Civic Coalition (KO), The Left (Lewica), the Polish People’s Party (PSL) and Poland 2050 (Polska 2050) – as well as from most of the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja).

>The second vote, on whether to permit Romanowski to be placed in pretrial detention, was won with 234 votes in favour and 196 against. in that vote, all Confederation MPs present were opposed. PiS was opposed in both votes.

>

>Dariusz Korneluk, who holds the position of national prosecutor, told broadcaster RMF today ahead of the votes that, if the Sejm approved both requests, prosecutors would ask a court for approval to take Romanowski into pretrial detention.

>PiS, however, has argues that Korneluk holds his position illegitimately because Bodnar unlawfully removed the previous national prosecutor, Dariusz Barski, who had been appointed under PiS. Bodnar and Korneluk reject that claim, arguing that, in fact, it was Barski who had been illegitimately appointed.

>Speaking in parliament yesterday, Romanowski said that Korneluk’s involvement in the case against him renders it “an illegal action and constitutes a type of political repression, to which the Sejm should not consent”.

>“The prosecutor’s office’s actions in the Justice Fund case are undoubtedly carried out on political orders,” he added, quoted by news website wPolityce. “This is precisely why the prosecutor’s office was illegally taken over at the beginning of this year, to use it in a brutal political fight.”

">Parliament has rejected a bill that would have softened Poland’s strict abortion laws. While the measure was supported by the majority of the governing coalition, it was defeated thanks to the most conservative element of the ruling camp, which joined with the opposition to vote against it.

>The legislation would have decriminalised the act of helping a woman obtain an unlawful abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy. Under the current law, someone can be jailed for up to three years for doing so.

>It was proposed last year by Lewica (The Left), which is part of Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s ruling coalition. Tusk himself announced yesterday that his centrist Civic Platform (PO), the largest member of the coalition, would vote in favour.

>However, almost the entire caucus of the Polish People’s Party (PSL), the most conservative element of the government, voted against the bill today.

>PSL’s 24 votes, combined with 175 from the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, 17 from the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) and two from the right-wing Kukiz’15 – all three of which are opposition parties – meant there were 218 MPs against the bill.

>Only 215 MPs were in favour, with 154 from KO, 30 from the centrist Poland 2050 (Polska 2050), another member of the ruling coalition, 26 from the Left, four from PSL, and one independent.

>Earlier this week, President Andrzej Duda, a conservative PiS ally, had declared that he would veto the bill even if it was passed by parliament.

>

>The result of the vote was met with a standing ovation from the PiS benches. “Life and the constitution won,” declared PiS MP Bartłomiej Wróblewski.

>“The most vulgar attempt to violate the Constitution since 1989, depriving children before birth of legal protection, was defeated in the Sejm,” he added.

>Anna-Maria Żukowska of The Left, who initially proposed the bill, criticised her coalition partners for its failure. She noted that three PO MPs and two from Poland 2050 had not taken part in the vote. Had they supported the bill, it would have passed.

>“Oops, Donald Tusk’s and the coalition seem to have a problem,” wrote PiS spokesman Rafał Bochenek. “They promised and wanted to decriminalise criminal activities, but fortunately there is still SPIRIT IN THE NATION.”

>

>Today’s bill was the first of four intended to soften abortion laws that were given preliminary approval by the Sejm in April. The other three, which are still being discussed by a specially created parliamentary committee, would end the near-total abortion ban introduced under PiS in 2021.

>However, the future of those bills is also shrouded in doubt. Two of them – proposed by KO and The Left – would introduce abortion on demand, something that is opposed by PSL.

>The other, proposed by PSL and Poland 2050, would reintroduce the possibility of terminating pregnancy in case of severe birth defects, which was banned in 2021. Currently, abortion in Poland is only possible if the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the mother or if it results from a criminal act such as rape or incest.

>There are doubts in particular over whether the Left would support that latter bill, as it argues that such a “compromise” does not go far enough in protecting women’s reproductive rights.

>The money is supposed to come from the EU’s European Peace Facility, a financing mechanism established in 2021 for the purchase of ammunition and military equipment and that has since 2022 been used to support Ukraine’s defence against Russian aggression.

>The funds would compensate Poland for some of the roughly €4 billion worth of military aid it has provided to Ukraine, reports Defence24, an industry news service.

">**Considered a loyal ally of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS), President Andrzej Duda has spoken candidly of the challenges being experienced at the helm of the former ruling party.**

>In an interview aired by Polsat News on Friday night, Duda admitted that “PiS has been struggling to define its leadership since it lost power last autumn after eight years.” When challenged whether PiS was facing a leadership crisis, he said: “In a sense, yes.”

>The bombshell admission comes shortly after a former PiS agriculture minister revealed that he planned to create a new political party. Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski has become known for his criticisms of PiS, with Duda pointing out he had long doubted the party’s direction.

>“Looking at him, one can say that the cup of bitterness has overflowed,” added Duda.

>Other challenges have also emerged; PiS recently faced embarrassment in the Małopolska local assembly when Łukasz Kmita, the nominee of Jarosław Kaczyński, the party’s leader, failed to be appointed despite five attempts.

>During one such attempt, Kmita’s opponent was Piotr Ćwik, the deputy head of the presidential office. However, Duda has denied that was a ploy to “seize influence in the party”, saying that this was “a far-reaching claim”.

>Commenting on whether he still had faith in Kaczyński's ability to lead PiS, Duda said that he remained ""cautious when it came to such predictions.""

>However, he remained adamant that the party would ultimately survive. “Many times different things have been said about PiS, but despite that, the party has won elections,” he added.

">The European Commission has approved Polish plans to use around €194 million (900 million zloty) of EU funds towards construction of a terminal for offshore wind farms in the city of Gdańsk.

>The terminal will be located at the Baltic Hub – Poland’s largest container port – and will facilitate the installation and servicing of wind turbines in the Baltic Sea, which Poland plans to build as part of plans to generate up to 51% of electricity from renewables by 2040.

>

>The funds will be allocated as part of the so-called National Reconstruction Plan (known as KPO in Polish), an implementation of the EU’s post-pandemic Recovery and Resilience Facility (RFF).

>The total cost of the investment is estimated at 1.2 billion zloty (€253 million), with Istrana – the company responsible for the development of the Baltic Hub – covering the remaining 300 million zloty. European Commission approval was required for Poland to grant state aid to Istrana.

>Construction will start at the beginning of the third quarter of this year and the terminal is expected to become operational in 2026. To accommodate the new facility, the Baltic Hub will be expanded by 21 hectares.

>

>Though Poland currently has no offshore wind farms, it plans to make them a key element of its green transition. The country’s current official energy plan anticipates offshore wind capacity reaching 5.9 GW by 2030 and 11 GW by 2040.

>However, a more ambitious updated draft published last year by the previous government raised the latter figure to 18 GW and set a goal of generating 51% of Poland’s power from renewables by 2040.

>Currently, Poland generates around two thirds of its electricity from coal, which is the highest proportion in Europe. Last year, however, it produced a record 26% of power from renewables, up from 19.3% the previous year.

>

>The construction of Poland’s first offshore wind farm is set to begin this year. Known as Baltic Power, it is a joint venture between Polish state energy giant Orlen and NP Baltic Wind, a subsidiary of Canada’s Northland Power.

>The wind farm will be located around 23 kilometres off Poland’s Baltic coast and will comprise of 76 250-metre-high turbines, each with a unit capacity of 15 MW. Orlen estimates that, once completed, the project will supply around 3% of Poland’s electricity needs.

">A memorial to victims of the Volhynia massacres, in which around 100,000 ethnic Poles were slaughtered by Ukrainian nationalists during World War Two, has been unveiled in Poland.

>The monument, which was funded by the Polish Army Veterans’ Association in America, has drawn controversy due to its brutal depiction of a baby being impaled on a Ukrainian trident. Several cities refused to host the statue, which was eventually built in the village of Domostawa in southeast Poland.

>Thousands of people attended Sunday’s official opening, including figures from the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party. However, Poland’s two main political parties, the centrist Civic Platform (PO) and national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS), did not send representatives.

>

>The memorial – a 20-metre-tall bronze sculpture created by the late artist Andrzej Pityński – depicts an eagle, the national symbol of Poland, being consumed by flames. On its wings are the names of places whose inhabitants were murdered by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA).

>The precise death toll of the massacres is unknown, but estimates range up to 120,000. The victims, the majority of whom were women and children, were in many cases killed with extreme brutality.

>For that reason, Pityński’s sculpture features at the centre of the eagle a depiction of a baby impaled on a trident representing the “tryzub”, which is the national symbol of Ukraine. The base of the monument also features children’s dismembered heads impaled on fence pickets.

>

>The brutal nature of the monument resulted in the cities of Rzeszów, Toruń, Jelenia Góra and Stalowa Wola refusing to host it. However, Tomasz Podpora, the mayor of the district in which Domostawa is located, defended the sculpture.

>“We have to say that this is how it was,” he told the Polish Press Agency (PAP). “The artist expressed his vision and that should not be changed.”

>The unveiling ceremony in Domostawa took place on the first weekend following Poland’s National Day of Remembrance of the Victims of the Genocide of Citizens of the Polish Republic Committed by Ukrainian Nationalists, an annual commemoration established by parliament in 2016 and held on 11 July.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZkpOcWV1QjNaSzEzc09rdFo4MXdEcU9DUk50Y3cwcy1FdVJZTy1uSlI4RnpsV3E0S1BzTnBqUjM0TmctaTlzeGZsd3VaamNwVVFQWl9jM003Vm5kMWc9PQ==
">Włodzimierz Osadczy, a historian at the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL) and member of the committee behind the sculpture’s construction, expressed satisfaction that “the truth about Volhynia is beginning to emerge” despite Polish politicians too cautiously “weighing their words” when speaking about the crime.

>“We do not weigh words when we condemn the crimes of the Holocaust, we do not weigh words when we condemn Auschwitz,” he told PAP. “However, here we are told to weigh words. We should not weigh words, but call things by their names and pay tribute to the victims who suffered an unbelievable death.”

>However, the monument was criticised by the president of the Union of Ukrainians in Poland, Mirosław Skórka, who told broadcaster TVN that “the Volhynia massacre should be discussed, considered and prayed for, not turned into a spectacle that is supposed to reinforce hatred”.

>

>Sunday’s unveiling was attended by descendants of victims of the massacres as well as many patriotic organisations, reports local newspaper *Nowiny*. While some representatives of local authorities were present, there were none from the regional or national authorities.

>Leading figures from Confederation, which has seats in both the Polish and European parliaments, also attended. They criticised the national authorities for failing to pursue the “historical truth” about the massacres, including by pushing for the exhumations of victims.

>The history of Volhynia continues to cause tensions between Poland and Ukraine. While the Polish authorities have declared the massacres to be a genocide, Ukraine rejects that label.

>

>Recent years have seen a renewed push for exhumations of victims buried in what is now Ukraine. Last year, a deputy Polish foreign minister warned that “it is hard to imagine” Ukraine being allowed to join the EU without first allowing exhumation.

>Poland’s prime minister at the time, Mateusz Morawiecki, said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had pledged that exhumations would take place. In October, the then Polish government announced that a mass burial pit containing victims of the massacres had been found in Ukraine.

>Meanwhile, in further signs of progress, Zelensky and Polish President Andrzej Duda jointly attended a ceremony to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the massacres and the chairman of Ukraine’s parliament expressed sympathy for the pain felt by Poles over the “terrible events in Volhynia”.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYXBCV1NtbGJ2ZnFpZE9jWGFDamZJWmwzT2R4dW9iVXNQNnVBeDdyQTVxRjJtaHczVjREOGxaTGdGMTYzeUhZYnIteERTdi1yREktRWE2Wjc4LXZONmc9PQ==
">NATO’s secretary general has rejected Poland’s proposal that it could shoot down Russian missiles that are over Ukraine but heading towards Polish territory. This would risk NATO “becoming part of the conflict”, says Jens Stoltenberg.

>The idea was included last week in a security agreement between Poland and Ukraine signed by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw.

>The two countries pledged to bilaterally and with other allies “examine the rationale and feasibility of possible intercepting in Ukraine’s airspace missiles and UAVs \\[unmanned aerial vehicles\\] fired in the direction of the territory of Poland”.

>

>Tusk emphasised that such a policy would only be introduced with “the stamp of approval of the international community, preferably NATO”. However, when asked about the idea by Ukrainian media outlets on Sunday, Stoltenberg responded negatively.

>“NATO’s policy is unchanged: we will not be involved in this conflict. We will not become part of the conflict,” he said. “We support Ukraine in the destruction of Russian aircraft, but NATO will not be directly involved.”

>Last week, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller was also asked about Poland’s proposal. He said that, for now, there were no changes to US or NATO policy.

>“But obviously any time a NATO member wants to raise a policy, they have the ability to do so and discuss it with other heads of state,” he added. “They’ll have a \\[NATO\\] summit this week and I’m sure that is something that could be discussed if he \\[Tusk\\] would like to do so.”

>

>On the sidelines of last week’s NATO summit in Washington, Polish foreign minister Radosław Sikorski mentioned the idea of Poland shooting down Russian missiles over Ukraine during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute.

>He noted that, while Poland can currently target Russian missiles that enter its airspace – as some already have – doing so can cause debris that in itself is dangerous.

>“The Ukrainians are saying, ‘Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they’re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory.’ To my mind, that’s self-defence, but we are exploring the idea,” added Sikorski.

>

>Defence minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, also speaking in Washington, like Tusk emphasised that Poland would never take such a step unilaterally. “If NATO does not make such a decision, Poland will not make it individually,” he told Polskie Radio.

>One NATO ally has, however, expressed openness to the idea. Lithuanian President Gitanas, speaking to the Polish Press Agency (PAP), said that the proposal “was not raised by \\[Polish\\] President \\[Andrzej\\] Duda during the North Atlantic Council but it is circulating”.

>“My answer is: why not? We have to look for new ideas, because often the old formulas that we stick to are not effective, they do not work. That is why we hear such new ideas,” he added.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhYUxXdHBsTVpUd3dnZWFSeUJSTWtfYXY4bVpyYlhlaWk3eTR0UnhyWkE2OV83RHJRVzdHX0tRX0ZjOVdSdllvRWhENVFrc1VYZ3RfQmJNdXV6V0xSVGc9PQ==

">Poland’s government has named a new figure to head the Polish embassy in the United States. However, he will not formally be an ambassador because President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, has refused to sign off on his nomination.

>The appointment of Bogdan Klich, a senator from the main ruling Civic Platform (PO) party, has also been criticised by PiS figures given that he has strongly criticised Donald Trump in the past.

>“Senator Bogdan Klich will soon arrive in Washington and take over the management of the Polish embassy,” foreign minister Radosław Sikorski told broadcaster RMF.

>“He probably won’t be an ambassador because the president announced that he won’t sign off \\[on nominations\\] for anyone, especially not for Senator Klich, but he will become the head of the mission,” added Sikorski.

>

>Last month, Duda announced that, while he remains in office, he will not sign off on the government’s nomination for Klich to become ambassador.

>He noted that Klich served as defence minister at the time of the Smolensk disaster, when a Polish military plane crashed in Russia, killing then-president Lech Kaczyński and 95 others.

>“Radosław Sikorski and \\[Prime Minister\\] Donald Tusk want to send as Polish ambassador to the US, to the world’s largest military power, where the safety and health of the president is in a category unimaginable to Poles, a man who was defence minister when the president of Poland died in a plane crash in a military plane,” said Duda.

>

>“It will be one big joke,” added the president, speaking to TV Republika. “I will never agree to this, as long as I am the president for another fourteen months I will never sign this ambassadorial nomination. I will not sign it because I will not compromise Poland.”

>However, speaking to RMF, Sikorski said that “if PiS has proof of Senator Klich’s participation in the Smolensk attack, he will not go to the US but to jail”.

>PiS has long claimed that the former PO-led government was responsible for causing the Smolensk crash, or at least helped Russia cover up the true causes. However, despite spending eight years and tens of millions of zloty reinvestigating the crash, PiS has failed to offer proof supporting its claims of a conspiracy.",r/europeanpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNGFYanR4WS1TMW9MYy0xR01BbklhcEtGWTdGeHQyT3dLMmMteDVNaHFSR0tBZGJxejVXU090OEk3aFJnNjVVTVpEV0hnSXlDQUhxWS0za3k0VF92NEE9PQ==
">Polish ambassadors are nominated by the foreign ministry but formally appointed by the president. Duda’s current – and final – term in office lasts until the middle of next year.

>For now, Klich will hold the title of chargé d’affaires at the embassy in Washington. However, in the absence of an ambassador, he will, in practice, head the mission. He will take over from Marek Magierowski, Duda’s former spokesman, who has served as ambassador in Washington since 2021.

>A number of senior PiS figures today criticised the appointment of Klich, noting that in the past he has called Trump – who may soon return as president – an “unbalanced politician who doesn’t respect democracy” and whose “presidency ended in shameful riots”.

>

>Speaking last month, Duda also pledged not to approve the government’s nomination of Ryszard Schnepf – who served as ambassador to the US from 2012 to 2016 – as ambassador to Italy.

>As justification, Duda noted that “Schnepf’s father, together with the Soviets, participated in the Augustów Roundup against Poles”, referring to a Soviet operation in 1945 to eliminate Polish anti-communist partisans. Schnepf’s father, Maksymilian, commanded a military unit that supported the operation.

>Earlier this month, the *Gazeta Wyborcza* daily reported that PiS had been putting pressure on Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – whose Brothers of Italy party is allied with PiS in the European Parliament – not to accept Schnepf as ambassador.

>Subsequently, Sikorski confirmed in an interview with broadcaster TVN that he had “looked into this rumour and unfortunately it is confirmed”.

>In March, Duda criticised the government’s plans to replace over 50 ambassadors appointed under the former PiS administration.
