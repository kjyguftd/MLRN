"I have no idea at this point. This coin did hover around $3-6 before exploding to $240 and literally no one thought that was possible at that time. I would say however that at this point with BTCs price and the history of FIL, you would expect us to be at $40-50 at this point and we are sitting around $5-6. 

The amount of inflation the coin has undergone is extreme, but it was also inflating at an extreme rate when it blew up before. Its also why people thought it wouldn't rise before. Idk, its also hard to know the exact market cap because I read conflicting info on how its accurately depicted. Coin Market Cap doesnt account for burn rate which is built into Filecoin and my previous research indicated anywhere from 80million -160million have been burned, its hard to find 100% accurate info on this. So its not 5x inflated its 3-4x inflated depending.

The real question to ask is if its INSANE and UNHEARD of for a coin to do 3-4x its previous marketcap, because thats what we would need to do hit the previous All Time High again or come close to it. Id say its very normal for coins to do 3-4x what they did before, but who knows. Dogecoin and Shiba and Pepe would have made anyone rich and they have 0 usecase outside of being memes.

"I'm sorry I can't answer that question unless you mean ""why should Filecoin devs care"" in which case as I have already said this has a very negative impact on the Filecoin project. Staking in ETH is designed by the Eth dev team such that you can't be robbed. Filecoin Staking and stFIL give the impression that the situation is similar. In reality clearly not. As a newcomer to Filecoin I saw the Staking service mentioned in many places and assumed it was legitimate.

"I started using Filet through the latest bear market. It's been fine. E-mails returned promptly. No issues getting tokens transferred back. I decided to stay native FIL with Topia/FilFox wallet. The best value for me is the year duration, which is by far their biggest TVL inventory, and probably most stable for their operations. I tried the Flexible option for about 8 months, but just wasn't worth it for me. With the 180-360day lock-ups, you can get an extra 2% kicker with an inventory over 5k FIL.  I basically do my own record keeping on a spreadsheet to verify the APR, inventory staked, and time remaining on each stake. My realistic APR returns have been 11-15% (which is still more than the liquid providers). You get immediate access to about 20% of daily earnings with the remainder locked up until the expiration (also now an option to extend with an airdrop. the airdrop is about an extra 2% -- which locks up until the end of the airdrop period; you do get the previous cycle unlocked).  Their blogs and youtube presentations seem like a telemarketer selling you tupperware (let's be honest, this isn't risk free, and the APR had been overstated, although they have reduced the advertised rate to something more realistic for a stable system), Overall, I've been happy with Filet.

"I feel for you. Filet offers a 90day, which isn't so bad for a lockup (although max in this option advertised at 3k Fil). Based in Silicon Valley, hopefully that's more stable political environment. The 'flexible'/liquid option really isn't their forte. But, they are the longest running Fil service in the Filecoin ecosystem. In the past few years for me, no major issues on getting back my 180-360day stakes. They have periodic glitches, but are rectified/reconciled fairly quickly by their team.  On their worst days, I see comparative 7-8% return as to Glif, on their best days 25-28%; overall average for me has been about 11-15%. Really not that bad, I've been pretty happy with it.  Filecoin itself is probably over-tokenized comparative to current market cap, but the project is a multi-years, hopefully the true value shows by 2030.

"Great question. All I can say my friend is that a lot of coins that went 10-20x and the whole Market was insane. Interest rates were way lower, inflation wasnt a huge concern untaround 2022 when the Ukraine and Russia war started, and since then we started to sea lot of complications and rising prices of goods, services, commodities you name it. Especially gas prices. Everything is more expensive. With interest rates being so high, we likely wont see much speculation AKA large sums of cash into more speculative assets like crypto in general (despite me thinking its not nearly as risky as the bullshit US dollar). Many coins have barely if at all recovered since then, but if we find ourselves in a crazy crypto mania I think we may be able to see those highs again. All this to say that I think FIL reached its highs, alongside many other coins, due to the lower interest rate environment we were in and more people had money to spare back then. Now days, shoot car payments are double what they used to be, mortgage rates and housing prices and rent prices are higher, car insurance is higher so we are all tighter on money and institutions aren't taking big loans out with these higher interest rates to speculate on crypto.",r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtSWlfSU1tejFtTjE4ZHV4VHFPaVpRZF95VFlHWlVVNTRzVld3TDJvSUdvY1lsUnN6dXdYakx6SjBXNUNkRXBvZHJvYmQtMVJWb2RHdG1zdFV0SHdRdGRmZ2tzSkxIM3k0SHZSUG1hcjVNeUU9

"I think for one it was only 100 million coins at the time and now its 550 million because the system is based on extreme inflation for some reason. On the other hand the inflation was there even before, but it was just a lower amount of coins. It was fairly new, it popped off and it inspired a lot of money. You can see this even with meme coins today. If literally anything starts moving people adopt it in mass to catch the train. We would need an extreme situation like that to push it. 

You just never know. I wouldn't be shocked to see it go to $200, im just not expecting that at all. Id hope for $50-100. I remember when XRP was worth a 4th of 1 cent, people talked about $1, everyone called them insane, mentioned how impossible it would be, etc. Then XRP went to $3, triple the ""impossible"" number.

"Filecoin has very strong fundamentals, although it will take time, till DePin tech is ready. 

Proving that you stored some file or have some storage available takes a lot of compute, which leads to a very high initial hardware investment. (Cryptographic proofs are not for free)

But, when the Decentralized Storage industry takes off, this will incentives to build appropriate hardware. Similar to Bitcoin Asics, but economically more sustainable. This makes l buying this kind of hardware a long term investment, which makes it super cheap. A miner could lower his investment by 3x or more, while revenue stays the same. More miners buying hardware, makes the hardware even cheaper and better. At the same time Filecoin will become less computationally demanding. 

While filecoin miners have to stake FIL, the price  will rise proportionally to the demand of decentralized storage or storage in general.

"Price is very important as this is the leading factor into businesses establishing infrastructure to support the network. My inclination is that the bull run really hasn‚Äôt started and won‚Äôt really kick off until late August. If you look at BTC correlation it hasn‚Äôt really broken the $70K threshold in any significant manner. 

The fundamentals of BTC price revolve around hardware dumping and acquisition by small and large BTC farms respectively. Price is suppressed when the large firms liquidate large holdings for cash on hand to purchase the hardware of small firms that are liquidating due to the halving events effect on their revenue. After hardware acquisition takes hold and the hardware is delivered and turned on, a period of holding resumes for the large farms to reconsolidate their holdings for an anticipated ATH dump and maximum profits.

Fil is oversupplied and will be ball and chained due to its own tokenomics.

"Filecoin is one of the projects that will be around in 50 years and beyond. Everyone runs out of data storage and needs data storage these days. Filecoin has all the data storage for most of the world. Shib and Doge were all hype and community backed. Your right both are useless and will always be useless. They introduce newbies to crypto. I think file could go pass the big market cap but it will be for the utility it has not just hype. In my opinion file can easily hit $50 or alot higher.

"The tokenomics are actually just complicated for the majority of people to understand. 

FIL is inherently deflationary because of its capped supply and burn protocols. New emissions have plummeted from launch and will only continue to plummet as more data comes online and simply with time.

Couple that with all of the locked or collateralized FIL to even store data and you realize a significant portion of the network isn't and won't be liquid in any future.

However, the rhetoric at large out there right now is exactly the opposite and it's killing retail investment at the moment. 

I wouldn't expect 98% of people to even be able to digest spec.filecoin.io though and furthermore protocol labs doesn't seem to care about retail at the moment (which is fine). 

These things all lead to FIL being a longer term play and like you said a good buy.",r/filecoin,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEcUhjQjY1Um0zdUZBY3VUVDVTWG0zVFd6TjJ3YW1SRVJoYlZGdUxCYnAxaFUwczdsOHZkenUxT1BTRF9yU0dIQ2tNazlvQzlUdW5pbFYzeXg5LW9WOGc9PQ==

"for me, filecoin and storj (dare i say mention the alternative), were both investments for long-term growth.
