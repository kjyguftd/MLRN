"I see what you're getting at. I'm not sure how, if at all, the major indexes adjust for this.

On one hand, yes, summing the total market caps of both does suggest an overlap.

On the other, what can be done about it without being inaccurate? Do you reduce BRK? Do you reduce AAPL? Some other adjustment? In all cases, you'd be forced to say that something ***isn't*** worth what it actually, plainly is.

I am aware there's an adjustment for market float, and that ***may*** be in play here to some degree, but I'm not sure what that degree would be in this specific case as, afterall, BRK can still ultimately trade AAPL away. If they did, BRK would still have the same value (just trading AAPL shares for cash), and AAPL would also be unaffected (nothing has changed about the company).

"Like all these people (Ramsey, Ohrman, etc) who do the whole ""financial self-help"" stuff, it's somewhat useful for people who are absolute financial disasters but unhelpful and potentially harmful for those who aren't. If you are 50 years old and haven't saved a dime, and for some reason you'll listen to Kiyosaki, then he will change your life because he convinced you to stop being a moron. It's still not great advice but he has you doing better than before. However, once you have the basic knowledge that you should be putting money away and investing, he gets very dangerous. Here are some things he has advocated for, and remember his audience is the average joe with these books:

1. Investing in distressed real estate (with large tax liens, for instance)

2. Going whole hog into flipping foreclosures, with no experience in any of the related skills

3. Everyone should join an MLM (he should be in jail for how he pushes these scams, IMO)

4. Penny stocks

So, as soon as you gain the understanding that you need to invest you have gotten all good info out of a guy like Kiyosaki. After that he becomes dangerous. Ramsey is less dangerous but instead just gives advice that is not relevant to anyone but the worst off financially. Ohrman has nothing new to say, or even interesting, and really became rich off of yelling at people.

However it's sequel is even more impactful - cash flow quadrant. If you can only read one book on finance cash flow quadrant is it.

We are often taught that getting a good job will set us up for life, but NO ONE becomes wealthy from employment income.

If you have a good job, you still need to invest significant savings to build wealth. This seems intuitive to some, but it's surprising how few people in reality realize that they are in control of their own financial future.

"""The Bes Damn Sales Book Ever"" is a pretty fun humorous read. The audiobook is narrated by the author Warren Greshes, and he's basically a comedian and a salesman put together. It's pretty basic and cliche shit, but if you're new to sales, it's pretty solid, and not too greasy from my memory. 

""Flip the Script"" by Oren Klaff was one I originally really liked, but now that I've been selling for over a decade, I realize alot of that book is top sensationalized and overcomplicstes the process. 

To be honest, I haven't read a sales book in years. Most are garbage and just super greasy, and I hate that shit, it's rookie and doesn't work. 

Better than any book I've ever read is one simple quote from a YouTuber that I forgot the name of. ""SW3N"" (As in ""sw"" cubed like exponents)

"Everyone shits on this book on reddit.

It is commonly mentioned as the cornerstone book in interviews with people who just hit a million dollars.

Why the disconnect? There is a key idea in the book that no other financial self help book goes into; assets vs liabilities. Assets vs liabilities is a concept a lot of people don't encounter until this book. The book does exceptionally well going over it. And it brushes on a few other good money mindset ideas. 

It is well worth a read if you are doing all the main financial self help books. 70% of it is garbage and bad advice. 30% is crucial.

"Here’s a an interesting white paper from Moody that compares proposed policies of both presidents on inflation, interest rates & GDP.

Obviously take it with a grain of salt. My Econ understanding isn’t super advanced (just graduated undergrad from ivy with a degree in Econ) but conceptually his immigration policy tracks with higher I rates. 

Restricting border & deporting illegal immigrants lead to a lower  unemployment rate (reducing employee pool) which would cause an increased inflation rate, which would lead to higher interest rates. (Feds dual mandate & Philips curve). 

Should also be stated (and I don’t fully understand but) the standard inverse relationship between home price & mortgage rates (function of HP & interest rates) has broken down. Generally the sharp climb in rates from the 2s a couple years ago to 6s now should have caused prices to decline. Obviously that hasn’t been the case. This phenomenon can be partially explained by the velocity of market transactions, wherein the rapid rise of I rates has effectively locked people into their homes. This has led to drastically reduced supply, driving sales prices up for listed homes.

This all begs the question: what is the best mortgage rate for HPA.",r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZT0dOdktOeEFIcDh5TXBkY08xcEZ4elBIR0M3dFoxenN4Wngxb0ZzSjRBZ3pWNnRKZURBY053WjhHU20xR1ZHMVBVNDJiZ0NRaTRHSEFDTThOLVJOQzBfU3djYjlJcVlqdVdHdmFDXzBnbmc9

"The president appoints members of the fed board of governors as well as the chairman who set interest rates. Low interest rates result in money being loaned for mortgages for less. More people qualify for higher amounts of loans because not as much of the monthly payment goes to interest and demand for housing goes up. When demand for housing goes up, the price gets more expensive.

"?

Fomc makes its own policy decisions. Nothing to do with the president. They have unemployment and inflation mandate, that's it.

Can a president affect inflation? Yes. If he reduces immigration which increases input cost of labor and turns on tariffs against China again, which increases cost of good in general, then that could certainly cause high rates and inflation.  What does that mean for housing? Nothing. Only supply affects housing costs at this point",r/finance,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZeklDTVBqTEhYY2pGVkYxcEZ5MHQ4WDhqMC1HaFhnNk1kYktvYWhncVlCN0o0OGhpNGZfWGU4NnNuNlhjOHlhdnZJblZXZERxU2MxZjM4d3BRWmtPUEE9PQ==
