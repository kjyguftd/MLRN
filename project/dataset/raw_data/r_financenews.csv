">An economic indicator the Federal Reserve favors as an inflation gauge rose less than expected in August, showing that the central bank’s fight against higher prices is making progress  
The personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy increased 0.1% for the month, lower than the expected 0.2% gain from the Dow Jones consensus of economists, the Commerce Department reported Friday. On a 12-month basis, the annual increase for core PCE was 3.9%, matching the forecast.

Well that’s just great but it feels like inflation is out of this world.  I literally just went to the grocery store and bought 5 apples, 5 pears, 4 tomatoes, and 7 bananas and it cost me $24.  None that was expensive organic either.  That’s like maybe 2500 calories worth of food so a little over a day worth of food for an adult.  Eating that for a month (assuming 2000 calories per day) would cost me about $600 which is insane as 2 years ago I‘d live off of less than half of that amount.",r/financenews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSbkFwdVAxMkpuUi10Z21QSzJuY2ttNkN2WHliMm9weE9nLVI1a0JPNi04MEtmbHNnSmgtallNSUJrMVkxaHFiSTVHQ2lmOXdObUNHMU9TcDFTS0NHbnc9PQ==

"It makes sense to get more info on these topics:

## Brexit's Ongoing Implications

* **Background**: The UK's decision to leave the EU has had profound and ongoing implications for the financial sector.
* **Potential Impact on Asset Management**: Brexit might impact fund structures, regulatory compliance, and the ability to serve clients across Europe. While the initial stages of Brexit have passed, its ongoing implications – such as alterations to financial passporting or new trade agreements – could continue to influence the UK's asset management industry.
* **Why Relevant**: Asset managers need to be prepared for regulatory shifts and understand how changing economic conditions in both the UK and EU might influence investments.

## Sustainability and ESG Investing

* **Background**: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have become increasingly significant for investors in recent years.
* **Potential Impact on Asset Management**: As more clients prioritize ESG investing, asset managers must ensure they offer products that meet these demands. They also need to stay updated with the ever-evolving standards and regulations surrounding sustainability.
* **Why Relevant**: Beyond the ethical implications, ESG factors can also represent material risks and opportunities. An asset manager that overlooks ESG considerations might miss out on growth opportunities or expose their clients to undue risk.

## Digital Transformation and Fintech Competition

* **Background**: The rise of fintech, increased use of AI, and blockchain in finance can't be ignored. Challenger banks, robo-advisors, and decentralized finance platforms are reshaping the landscape.
* **Potential Impact on Asset Management**: These technological advancements might influence how asset managers operate, from algorithmic trading to improved risk analysis. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is shifting, with fintech firms potentially eating into traditional asset managers' market share.
* **Why Relevant**: To stay competitive, asset managers need to adopt and integrate the latest technologies. They also need to be wary of new entrants and be prepared to adapt their business models.",r/financenews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSUV9iTFIyc0pXM2RHTURWSWo5NFVidEtWN093ZWZCOHRUdGh1bExqeEpOQ1ZOYXEzWXdxeEJKbFNiRHZicXRlSEx2RmFHOGZWSUt2bF9QOUVxeUFreFpMR3dsZFNNSFdvT2lmdEtzOGNGeVE9
"For those of us who prefer to see the 5 items in the article summarized:

>1 – The national debt is over $33 trillion and the government’s about to shut down (again)  
>  
>2 – Oil is headed north of $100 a barrel  
>  
>3 - The UAW strike could crush the car market  
>  
>4 - Nearly 44 million student loan borrowers will soon see payments restart  
>  
>5 - Mortgage rates nearing 8% threatens to restart the housing deep freeze

The UAW and student loan repayment restart is my least concern.

The cost of servicing the debt has already doubled and will only continue to rise requiring either more debt or cuts in spending.

The cost of oil is a huge problem because the policies of the party in the White House is focused on eliminating oil and replacing it with renewables and we just don’t have the infrastructure to support all the renewables they want.

Rising mortgage rates are a scary problem.  Many people if not most people have been treating their home as a piggy bank, drawing in the equity to help fund their lives.  That worked well when interest rates were at 3% but at 8% that’ll be far less viable.  In addition with so many people now stuck in their homes as a result of having locked in low rate mortgages the housing industry could literally face near collapse as people simply aren’t going to be able to move.  A major slowdown in the housing industry will affect every corner of the economy.",r/financenews,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSOEtEc0Q5SmRGdjN0al9CVl9oT0pvdXRYRk1LZV84eTVLNmVkZ0ticERkZEJfR2gwbUcwU01jcUVCWU5VQ3BWalBVeldBa3pXeG5HU2dtelhDeFhaSEE9PQ==
