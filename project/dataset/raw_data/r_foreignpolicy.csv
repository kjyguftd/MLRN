Have a sensible immigration/migration system that allows for legal and safe migration with incentives to go back ie tax reciprocity (like us has with Uk for example) - so retirement back home is an option. We can’t have millions here in the shadows often using fake ids - dangerously crossing the border via criminal intermediaries. This would help improve Central America immensely. Reducing income for criminals; enabling reinvestment in the countries when folks return home; improve wage rates dramatically in home countries because employers would be competing with a legal option to migrate to U.S. where pay would be higher; not split off families for decades with the men coming to us unable to get home (because of their illegal status in America)… and so on!

"> In the week since the U.S. military and allies attached a temporary pier to the Gaza shoreline, Pentagon planners have come face to face with the logistical nightmare that critics had warned would accompany the endeavor.
> 
> The Defense Department predicted that a steady stream of humanitarian aid would be arriving in Gaza via the pier by now, but little relief has reached Palestinians in the besieged strip, officials acknowledged this week. Several trucks were looted as they made their way to a warehouse, the U.N. World Food Program said, and the complexity of operating the pier project in a war zone is continuing to slow distribution.
> 
> The problems, as expected, are on the back end of the operation. Looting of aid trucks has continued, officials said, and forced the World Food Program to suspend operations for two days. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, suspended food distribution in Rafah on Tuesday, citing lack of security. It added that it had not received any medical supplies for 10 days because of closures and disruptions at the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border crossings.
> 
> The project was always expected to be difficult. For one thing, White House policy does not allow U.S. troops to be on the ground in Gaza. So the Pentagon has the ability to start but not finish the mission, a situation one military analyst likened to having the engine of a car but not the wheels.
> 
> As the pier project struggles to get going, the situation in Gaza becomes more dire by the day. More than 34,000 people have died and more than 77,000 have been wounded, according to health authorities in the territory. The number of casualties will only increase as Israel expands its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza.
> 
> Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday of causing “starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.” The Israelis vehemently denied the charges.
> 
> But many Gazans are experiencing immense hunger, aid groups say. Palestinians have forcibly taken aid from trucks, which U.N. officials have said reflects the desperation of people trying to feed themselves and their families. Aid groups and the United Nations have also blamed the hunger crisis on black marketers who have seized supplies to sell at inflated prices.
> 
> It is extremely difficult to distribute aid without police escorts to protect the convoys from swarms of people, UNRWA and U.S. officials say.
> 
> The pier project is the Biden administration’s attempt to alleviate some of the humanitarian suffering in Gaza. Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, described the process on Tuesday as a “crawl-walk-run approach.”
> 
> President Biden announced the project during his State of the Union address in March, amid warnings that Gaza was on the precipice of famine. The Pentagon built and assembled the pier alongside an Army ship off the coast with involvement from about 1,000 American troops, U.S. officials said. It is connected to central Gaza. On Friday, the first aid trucks began moving ashore.
> 
> So far, however, the operation has fallen short of its goal of bringing in 90 trucks a day and eventually ramping up to 150 trucks. Ten trucks came into the World Food Program warehouse on Friday, the agency said, but on Saturday, 11 of 16 trucks were looted. Operations were suspended for two days. On Tuesday, 17 trucks arrived, and 27 on Wednesday.
> 
> The Pentagon calls the project JLOTS, for joint logistics over the shore, a capability that it has used for humanitarian relief in Somalia, Kuwait and Haiti.
> 
> Military officials who have worked on past efforts say distributing humanitarian aid to those in need is harder than setting up the infrastructure.
> 
> “Getting a pier in place and getting supplies onto the pier and onto shore is one thing,” Rabih Torbay, the president of the aid organization Project Hope, said in an interview. “Getting the logistics in place to get the aid to the places that need it the most is a completely different ballgame, and that is where the lack of planning and coordination comes into play.”
> 
> 
> Paul D. Eaton, a retired major general, was in Somalia in 1993 when the U.S. military put a pier in place to deliver humanitarian aid to civilians caught in the war there. Some four light infantry Army battalions — 2,000 troops — were on the ground to help the aid get through, General Eaton said in an interview.
> 
> “The ships with humanitarian relief would deliver to the port, which we controlled absolutely, and then the trucks would be loaded,” he said. “And then we put armed forces — American armed troops — in the vehicles to protect the drivers.”
> 
> He added, “Supplies arrived in a protected environment, were loaded in a protected environment and were moved forward in a protected environment to the end use spot.”
> 
> That is not happening in Gaza.
> 
> The World Food Program warned on Tuesday that the pier project could fail if Israel did not do more to ensure the safe distribution of the aid. The agency suspended deliveries from the pier after the aid trucks were looted and one Palestinian man was killed.
> 
> While some food and commercial goods have been entering Gaza in recent days, few people in the war-ravaged enclave can afford to buy them after months of war without regular income. The cash crisis has increased the importance of aid to impoverished Gazans.
> 
> Abeer Etefa, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program, said a key to overcoming the aid impasse was receiving Israel’s permission to deliver goods on alternative routes. New routes were used on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the convoys reached their destinations without incident, she said.
> 
> The initial failures of the pier project have reinforced criticisms among some diplomats, who have said the initiative was too expensive and inefficient.
> 
> Pentagon officials have privately complained that the Biden administration came up with the pier project with little consultation with the military, which has had to build and operate the venture in the Mediterranean. Defense officials scrambled to put the plan in place after estimating that it would take two months to complete.
> 
> Even if all the kinks are ironed out, the sea operation would still be less efficient than a land route, aid organizations say. If the project reaches its goal of getting through 150 trucks per day, the shipments of food and other supplies would still fall short of what aid groups say is needed for a war-ravaged population.
> 
> Aid workers have described bottlenecks for shipments at border crossings caused by lengthy inspections of trucks, limited operating hours and protests by Israelis. Israeli officials deny that they are hampering the flow of aid, blaming the United Nations for backlogs.
> 
> “There is not yet an established process and architecture for aid delivery in Gaza,” said Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the former commander of U.S. Central Command.
> 
> “This is the responsibility of the international aid community and the I.D.F.,” he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. “This still is very much a combat zone.”",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVbk1GT1MxRWpmVnItRnRkRjctYjVKOWVpLWtGVEx2Wm1CdDZsZ2VqWVRTcjRHUk53OURmazNFUzNfUmJpTHE4Y0lXRzBOSS1FeHYyWm5VMUxjUFgxQ0E9PQ==
"> Israel recalled its ambassadors to Spain, Ireland and Norway on Wednesday to deliver a “severe reprimand” to the three countries after they committed to recognise Palestinian statehood next week.
> 
> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video criticising the move, and calling the intention to recognise a Palestinian state a “reward for terrorism”.
> 
> The move will add to the number of the EU’s 27 members that recognise Palestinian statehood, but does not include heavyweights from the bloc such as France. In a blow to their hopes for a broader diplomatic push, other countries that Madrid and Dublin had courted in recent weeks, including Belgium, Malta and Slovenia, did not immediately follow suit.
> 
> Ireland’s Taoiseach Simon Harris said he was “confident further countries will join us”. The trio said their move would take effect on May 28.
> 
> The development comes amid a split within the EU over a move by the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for the leaders of Israel and Hamas, as countries within the bloc struggle to unite on a response to the war in Gaza. It also follows a UN General Assembly vote this month backing a Palestinian application to become a full member state.
> 
> Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Netanyahu, who launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 35,000 people following Hamas’s October 7 attacks in Israel, had “no peace project for Palestine”.
> 
> Sánchez said: “Fighting the terrorist group Hamas is legitimate and necessary . . . But Netanyahu is creating so much pain and so much destruction and so much rancour in Gaza and the rest of Palestine that the two-state solution is in danger.”
> 
> Norway, which brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians in the early 1990s, said recognition of a Palestinian state was “the only alternative that offers a political solution for Israelis and Palestinians alike: two states, living side by side, in peace and security”.
> 
> Ireland referred to its own pitch for international recognition as it struggled for independence just over a century ago. “From our own history, we know what it means,” Harris said.
> 
> The Palestinian Authority welcomed the three countries’ move, saying they had “demonstrated their unwavering commitment to the two-state solution and to delivering the long-overdue justice to the Palestinian people”. It called on other countries to follow suit.
> 
> Most UN member states already recognise Palestinian statehood and Palestine is also recognised by Sweden, which acted alone in 2014, and by several central and eastern European members that had recognised it before joining the EU.
> 
> France has yet to take the step and has been seeking to rally other countries, including the UK, to back a wider bid.
> 
> France’s foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, said: “Our position is clear: the recognition of Palestine is not a taboo for France. This decision must be useful and permit a decisive step forward on the political level.”
> 
> British foreign secretary Lord David Cameron said in January that the UK could recognise Palestinian statehood as part of “irreversible steps” towards a two-state solution to the protracted Israeli-Palestinian crisis.
> 
> Arab and Palestinian officials have said recognition of a Palestinian state should be a crucial step to underpin moves towards a longer-term resolution of the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to bolster a future administration for the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
> 
> They want the US and other major western powers to support Palestine’s full membership of the UN through the Security Council. But the US this month opposed a resolution that would have paved the way for full Palestinian membership of the UN.
> 
> The three countries’ move prompted a sharp reaction from rightwing figures within Netanyahu’s government. The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, on Wednesday wrote to the prime minister demanding “punitive steps” against the Palestinian Authority in response to the European decisions and other Palestinian moves on the international stage, including seeking action against the Jewish state by the ICC.
> 
> Smotrich called for measures including a major expansion of Jewish settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and the freezing of Israeli tax transfers to the PA.
> 
> The PA, established in 1994, exercises limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank but lost control of the Gaza Strip to Hamas nearly two decades ago. Both territories are viewed by the international community as the basis for a Palestinian state.
> 
> Later on Wednesday, the extreme-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the al-Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, and said the site — known to Jews as the Temple Mount — “belongs only to the state of Israel”.
> 
> He spoke out against a Palestinian state at the contested site, which is regarded as the holiest in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam.
> 
> Also on Wednesday, Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would expand a law to allow Israelis to return to settlements in the north of the occupied West Bank — regarded as illegal by most of the international community — from which they had been banned since 2005. ",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVUlZRWjBaVlo2TnJGMUF3WF9QUnhYamh6b0ZmQ05BUjQ3MGZ4WEV3YXEzaVFuX2cxWUt6eXU3dHpKUnhfUkVKbHZfZGw5ZW1tQjdWcl9Id1ZqMGxWY3c9PQ==
"> They have nothing in common except their hatred of each other, their skills and longevity as leaders, their unyielding battle for political survival — and, now, stunning simultaneous blows. 
> 
> On Monday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced accusations of war crimes by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. Earlier that day, it was announced that Iran’s 85-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had lost a protégé and potential successor, a key pillar in his careful choreography to ensure a smooth handover. President Ebrahim Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash will ripple through the circles of power in Iran — but also through the region, as the war in Gaza reaches an inflection point.
> 
> Beyond the mechanics of choosing Iran’s next president and the fallout from the ICC’s prosecutor decision, this week’s events put in sharp relief how the Middle East finds itself stuck between Khamenei and Netanyahu, both clinging to power at the expense of their countries and the region. 
> 
> Netanyahu has been doubling down on war and defying US President Joe Biden to save his political career. On Sunday, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan tried again to sell him on a vision for the Middle East that would provide Israel with sustainable security and regional integration via normalisation with Saudi Arabia. However, the cost to Israel — tangible steps towards a Palestinian state — is still too high for Netanyahu. 
> 
> For his part, Khamenei has balanced restraint of Iran’s regional proxy militias with displays of force since October 7, while increasing repression and the power of hardliners at home. As Iran gears up for a sudden presidential election, his ability to project control will be severely tested.
> 
> While the focus should remain on Israel’s destructive military campaign in Gaza and the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, the increasingly fraught regional context matters just as much. The enmity between Iran and Israel, long in the shadows, erupted into the open last month with the direct exchange of missiles and drones. This was a stark reminder of how much worse tensions can become and how some of the larger dynamics in play are now driven by domestic political calculations. 
> 
> The shadow war between the pair continues. Last week, reports emerged that Jordan had foiled a suspected plot by Iranian-backed militias in Syria to smuggle weapons into the country, some on their way to the occupied West Bank, some to conduct acts of sabotage inside Jordan.
> 
> The rapprochement initiated in March last year between the Saudis and Iran is also being tested. The kingdom prefers the protection of a US defence pact and normalisation with Israel combined with a path towards a Palestinian state — a package which would shield Riyadh from Iran’s fire and pull the rug from under Tehran’s claim that it alone upholds the Palestinian cause.  
> 
> But after courting the Saudis for years, Netanyahu doesn’t seem interested anymore. And so the House of Saud sits between Iran’s missiles and militias and Netanyahu’s intransigence on discussing the “day after” the war in Gaza. 
> 
> The Israeli premier has been insisting on war until “total victory”, echoing the self-deluding slogan chanted in revolutionary Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. Ironically, both Netanyahu and Khamenei were around then — one as Israel’s deputy ambassador in Washington, the other as Iran’s president.
> 
> Netanyahu may have forgotten that Israel sold several hundred tons of weapons to Iran to help it fend off Iraqi advances, leading to a bloody stalemate. Israeli officials then hoped to engage moderate elements in the newly established Islamic Republic. Iran and Turkey had been the first two Muslim countries to recognise Israel after its founding in 1948 and Israel relied on these ties to reduce its isolation in a hostile Arab world. 
> 
> The opposite is true today: Israel now sees ties with Arab countries as a shield against Iran. But Netanyahu doesn’t seem to understand his new Arab friends are not interested in confrontation with Tehran. Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who also perished in the crash, summed up the current relationship between the two countries in December by saying “the only thing that Iran and Israel have in common is that neither of them believes in a two-state solution”. 
> 
> Yet this is the one thing which, if acquiesced to by Khamenei and Netanyahu, could bring their countries some respite from international pressure. ",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWWZRZUFRVEFxQ2N0RjRoR1FYdXBjTllCd0JEbGhZSGJ2LUEyZmJIa3dSWGQ2VW9fQU40enZwdnVYaC1MUXd1NXFrZGk0ZUJfcHo0bXU4d0lIWG41N3c9PQ==
"> On May 14, President Biden announced a major escalation of the country’s emerging climate trade war with China, raising existing tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent — a unilateral quadrupling. A few days earlier, responding to reports of Biden’s plans, Donald Trump outdid him, promising tariffs of 200 percent should he win the 2024 election.
> 
> It’s not just E.V.s. Five years after blasting Trump for imposing tariffs on Chinese exports, Biden raised them — on aluminum, steel, lithium batteries, solar cells and semiconductors, among other products. Trade protections of this scope would have been almost unthinkable even half a generation ago, when free markets were largely seen by leaders of both parties as opportunities to exploit and tariffs were regarded as an expression of hostile desperation by weak, developingnations. And tariffs would have been perhaps even harder to imagine then in pursuit of global climate goals, which had always called to mind not zero-sum economic competition but virtuous visions of “Kumbaya” cooperation and even global governance in the name of Gaia.
> 
> But since Trump’s election in 2016, chastened Democratic policymakers have come to see green industrial policy as a kind of one-size-fits-all, policy-and-politics tool — a recipe for addressing the climate crisis, yes, but also for the postindustrial “secular stagnation” of the U.S. economy, for the domestic manufacturing decline, for white working-class resentment and for the geopolitical challenge posed by China. Trade protectionism is now perhaps the closest thing we have to a bipartisan consensus in Washington, but sometimes all those goals sit at cross purposes. “There are few things that would decarbonize the U.S. faster than $20,000 E.V.s,” the M.I.T. economics professor David Autor recently said. “But there is probably nothing that would kill the U.S. auto industry faster, either.” And BYD, a Chinese automaker, just rolled out a model priced under $10,000.
> 
> Play a word-association game for “E.V.,” and an American is most likely to say “Tesla” first, but these days it would be better to say “China,” so astonishing has been the growth of the country’s electric-vehicle sector. In 2019, Chinese E.V. exports totaled $400 million; by 2023, they had reached $34 billion, a precipitous 85-fold increase and enough to help make the country, as recently as five years ago an afterthought in global auto exports, today the world’s top exporter of all cars. Nearly 60 percent of all the world’s E.V.s are now sold in China, which is home to three of the world’s four biggest E.V. manufacturers. In late 2023, BYD moved briefly into the top spot, shortly before Tesla issued a mass recall of its Cybertruck and reportedly canceled its plans for an affordable sedan.
> 
> At present, there are hardly any Chinese-manufactured E.V.s even available for sale in the United States, which makes the back and forth over tariffs look pretty performative in the short term. (Symbolically, it has got to be reassuring to American autoworkers, a key swing-state constituency.) But cast your eyes a little deeper into the future, and E.V. protectionism looks less like a market tweak, designed to even the playing field for American automakers, than a market wall. It’s designed to keep Chinese exports entirely out of the United States, at least while the huge industrial stimulus of the Inflation Reduction Act kicks in, and to protect domestic manufacturers from the competition of cars that might be half as expensive or twice as appealing through years in which the country is meant to be transitioning rapidly. (E.V.s are supposed to be half of all new car sales by 2030, according to the White House, up from 7.6 percent last year.)
> 
> Biden wagered an awful lot of first-term political capital on a new green industrial policy, which allocated more than $2 trillion in spending on the climate-focused I.R.A. and the climate-inflected infrastructure law and CHIPS Act. Now, toward the end of his term, he is trying to build a protective moat around America’s budding green industries. From the outside, it looks like a genuine climate trade war. Can it even be won?
> 
> You have probably heard about the miraculous growth of green energy around the world in recent years — in 2023, renewables for the first time provided 30 percent of all global electricity, and last month, in another first, fossil fuels provided less than a quarter of European Union power.
> 
> But though the carbon reductions are most impressive in Europe, the green boom is overwhelmingly a Chinese story. More than half of all new solar power installed in the world last year was installed inside China. For wind power, the share was even larger: China was responsible for 60 percent of all new global capacity. In just three years, the country has more than doubled the total amount of solar and wind power installed within its borders; in the United States, what looks like a breakneck build-out over the same period has pushed capacity up by less than 50 percent. Batteries, too: Last year China manufactured storage capacity equal to total global demand.
> 
> When you move upstream from final products into the green-tech supply chain, China dominates even more. It produces 84 percent of the world’s solar modules, according to a recent report by BloombergNEF. It produces 89 percent of the world’s solar cells and 97 percent of its solar wafers and ingots, 86 percent each of its polysilicon and battery cells, 87 percent of its battery cathodes, 96 percent of its battery anodes, 91 percent of its battery electrodes and 85 percent of its battery separators. The list goes on.
> 
> It is in this context that the United States is undertaking its clean-tech trade war — not from a position of strength or even parity. When the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, it was in response to plans for an American satellite, which made it into orbit just three months after the Russian launch; later in the Cold War, when American hawks lamented the “missile gap,” they were referring to a fiction, because the Russians had no advantage. Today, China controls more than 80 percent of many essential aspects of the global clean-energy supply chain; the United States controls almost none of it.
> 
> Does it matter? To hear Democratic policymakers from Biden and Janet Yellen on down tell it, the answer is yes. To navigate the green transition smoothly, they say, the country needs to avoid growing entirely dependent on China for clean energy in the way we previously relied so heavily on autocratic gulf states for dirty energy. They also want to avoid a replay of the “China shock” of the early 2000s, which decimated manufacturing labor across the industrial Midwest especially, and to combat the problem of “oversupply” from China on American businesses and workers. In a best-case scenario, subsidies and tariffs would together help American companies ramp up E.V. production so rapidly that U.S. manufacturers become a driving force behind the decarbonization of global transportation.
> 
> But there are risks. To begin with, industrial policy isn’t guaranteed to work, and no tariff is large enough to really reduce China’s global green-tech dominance, because the U.S. market isn’t all that significant to the Chinese. Green self-sufficiency is more achievable, and tariff defenders suggest they are meant to be temporary, allowing the American E.V. industry merely to find its footing. But for how long should we baby domestic industry when it means higher prices on so much of the good green stuff? “A glut in renewables and green products is precisely what the climate doctor ordered,” Dani Rodrik of Harvard wrote this month. As Bloomberg’s David Fickling has pointed out, Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Chinese solar-panel exports in 2018 may have meaningfully slowed American renewable rollout. Will American E.V.s fare any better?

"> An astute friend recently observed that today’s crisis in the Middle East boils down to one question about two dates: Which historic moment is likelier to be reversed: 1948 or 1979?
> 
> The dates are references to the creation of the state of Israel and, 31 years later, the Iranian revolution. The implication of the question is that it’s one or the other: The Jewish state and the Islamic republic cannot permanently coexist, at least so long as the latter seeks to destroy the former. Recent days have brought two potential vehicles for their downfall into focus.
> 
> There was, first, the announcement from Karim Khan, the International Criminal Court’s prosecutor, that he would apply for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel.
> 
> The decision is unlikely to ever lead to any arrests, much less to criminal convictions: The Biden administration has already denounced the decision, and even countries less friendly to Israel are unlikely to arrest the leader of a nation with nuclear weapons and a powerful intelligence agency.
> 
> But the announcement forms part of the same broad strategy that Israel’s adversaries believe will ultimately be the downfall of the state: international delegitimization and isolation, leading to gradual internal collapse or external conquest. Even Khan’s decision to seek the arrest of three Hamas leaders along with Netanyahu and Gallant is of a piece with the overall strategy, as it places Israel’s leaders on a moral par with a trio of terrorists.
> 
> Then there was the death on Sunday of Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, along with the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, and six other people apparently by accident — “apparently” because the possibility that the helicopter they were in was brought down by foreign or domestic saboteurs can’t be fully ruled out.
> 
> But whatever caused the crash, it both betrays and portends weakness for the regime.
> 
> Betrays, because competent states should be able to fly V.I.P. aircraft without incident. (The notable exception being the plane crash that killed President Lech Kaczynski of Poland and 95 others in 2010.) And portends, because Raisi, an ultra-hard-liner who cut his teeth as a prosecutor in the 1980s sending thousands of prisoners to the gallows, was widely seen as a successor to Iran’s 85-year-old supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
> 
> Now the country must, within 50 days, hold elections that will underscore the deep unpopularity of the regime: Voter turnout has been falling for years as Khamenei restricts the electoral slate to all but the most hard-line candidates. It also sets the stage for a power struggle to succeed him, particularly given the wide reluctance to hand the job to Khamenei’s unpopular son Mojtaba — which would effectively turn the regime into the type of monarchy it sought to replace.
> 
> Add to this mix a deep economic crisis — the Iranian rial now trades at about 577,000 to the dollar on the unregulated market — along with lingering fury over the brutal suppression of the 2022 protests, and the potential for severe instability or abrupt regime collapse is real.
> 
> So which country is more vulnerable: Israel or Iran?
> 
> The single most serious risk to Israel, as the former Iranian president Akbar Rafsanjani once put it, is that “the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything. However, it would only harm the Islamic world. It is not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality.” Iran’s expanding nuclear capabilities (and its opacity about them) should alarm the Western world a lot more than apparently it does.
> 
> But the dangers to Israel from moves at the I.C.C. — or, for that matter, from campus protests, boycott and divestment efforts or various kinds of arms embargoes — are minimal. Contrary to some opinions, Israelis are not “settler colonialists.” Jews believe they are originally from the land of Israel because they are. And Zionism, far from being a colonialist project, is the oldest anticolonialist struggle in history, starting during the Roman era, if not the Babylonian Captivity before it.
> 
> As for the idea that Israeli Jews should return, like the Algerian French pieds-noirs, to the lands of their forebears — where, and what, is that? The lands of Russian pogroms, or Arab massacres, or the Holocaust? Israel’s harshest critics tend to miss the point, but Israelis don’t: They have nowhere else to go, a fact underscored by the waves of hatred now engulfing Jewish diasporic communities. The more pressure is exerted on Israel to relent in the face of its enemies, the more Zionism it will generate. Nothing so crystallizes Jewish identity as these daily reminders of bigotry.
> 
> For Iran, the principal threat to the regime comes from within and below. It is easy to forget that before the 2022 mass protests over head scarves and women’s rights more broadly, there were the 2019 mass protests over the price of fuel and the 2018 protests over economic conditions. Or that, 10 years earlier, there was the 2009 Green Revolution over the stolen election, or the Iranian student protests of 1999.
> 
> Though the regime has proved adept at suppressing dissent through ultraviolent means — my colleague Nick Kristof has written powerfully about the use of mass rape as a means of suppressing opposition (something that somehow failed to generate much outrage at places like Columbia or Berkeley) — the increasing frequency and durability of these protests should tell us something.
> 
> Two things, in fact: The stock of public anger at the regime keeps rising as the bases of its support keep dwindling. With the death of Raisi, that dwindling base may, at the same time, be dividing. An informal law of economics, named for Herbert Stein, holds that “trends that can’t continue won’t.” It should be a law for political survival, too.
> 
> Like Iran, Israel still has profound domestic vulnerabilities, only some of which came to the fore in the months of protest over judicial changes that preceded Oct. 7. That’s to say nothing about right-wing extremism, the resistance of the ultra-Orthodox to fulfill their civic obligations or the ultimate question of an eventual Palestinian state. But none of those need put the deepest convictions of Zionism at stake: that Jews have the right to rule themselves as a sovereign state in their original homeland.
> 
> For Iran’s rulers, the risks are graver. They’ve always claimed to be the vanguard of an Islamic revolution, but they seem to have forgotten that revolutions have a history of consuming their own. Iran’s people, by and large, don’t want to be Islamists. But Israel wants, and will fight, to remain itself.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVLVo1X1FCdnBxZlFhSWpwdkFzZ1BmclVIdUVUaXRGVjF5SG1FYkhxbjNTM1BlUFRnVjMxenBfbGhHamxUNmJza244aFNtaFlMWGVDUlNlZnltY1RNRFE9PQ==

> The uncertainty ushered in by the death of Iran’s president, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash, just weeks after an unprecedented exchange of military attacks with Israel, has brought a chilling question to mind: Is 2024 the year that Iran finally decides it can no longer take chances with its security and races to build a nuclear bomb?
> 
> Up to now, for reasons experts often debate, Iran has never made the decision to build a nuclear weapon, despite having at least most of the resources and capabilities it needs to do so, as far as we know. But Mr. Raisi’s death has created an opportunity for the hard-liners in the country who are far less allergic to the idea of going nuclear than the regime has been for decades.
> 
> Even before Mr. Raisi’s death, there were indications that Iran’s position might be starting to shift. The recent exchange of hostilities with Israel, a country with an undeclared but widely acknowledged nuclear arsenal, has provoked a change of tone in Tehran. “We have no decision to build a nuclear bomb but should Iran’s existence be threatened, there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine,” Kamal Kharrazi, a leading adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on May 9.
> 
> In April, a senior Iranian lawmaker and former military commander had warned that Iran could enrich uranium to the 90 percent purity threshold required for a bomb in “half a day, or let’s say, one week.” He quoted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying that the regime will “respond to threats at the same level,” implying that Israeli attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities would cause a rethinking of Iran’s nuclear posture.
> 
> Iran’s relationship with nuclear technology has always been ambiguous, even ambivalent. Both during the regime of the pro-western Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the 1960s and 1970s and the anti-American Islamic Republic that has held power since 1979, Iran has kept outside powers guessing and worrying about its nuclear intentions. But it has never made the decision to fully cross the threshold of weaponization. There are several important reasons for this, ranging from religious reservations about the morality of nuclear weapons to Iran’s membership in the global Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). But the biggest reason has been strategic.
> 
> Historically, Iran’s leaders have repeatedly concluded that they have more to gain from “playing by the rules” of the international nonproliferation order than they do from racing for the bomb. To do so, they would have to first withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty, which would immediately signal their intentions to the world and could invite American military intervention. At the same time, the revolutionary government has been reluctant to cave into Western demands and dismantle their program altogether, as that would demonstrate a different kind of weakness. Iran’s leaders are no doubt keenly aware of the example of Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, who agreed in 2003 to abandon his country’s nuclear program, only to find himself overthrown eight years later following military intervention by a NATO-led coalition.
> 
> That strategic happy medium has worked well for the Islamic Republic — until now. Two decades of dysfunctional U.S. nuclear policy toward Iran have created a dangerous dynamic, in which Iran enriches more uranium than it otherwise might, either as a defensive posture or a negotiating tactic, and gradually inches its way toward being able to make a weapon that it might not even really want.
> 
> When the U.S.-Iran nuclear dispute first emerged in the early 2000s, Iran had only 164 antiquated centrifuges and little real appetite for a weapons program. But the Bush administration’s unrealistic insistence that Iran agree to “zero enrichment” turned it into a matter of national pride. During the years that the Obama administration spent negotiating with Iran, the regime kept enriching uranium and adding to its stockpile, in part as a hedge against future concessions. And of course, President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018 and subsequent campaign of maximum pressure only added to Iran’s defiance.
> 
> Today, Iran has thousands of advanced centrifuges and a large stockpile of enriched uranium. This, in turn, has provoked some camps inside Iran to adopt a “might as well” argument for nuclear weaponization. If we’ve already come this far, the argument goes, then why not just go for a bomb?
> 
> Under Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran has remained adamant that it is better off demonstrating to the world its willingness to stay within the nonproliferation treaty. But in recent years, as Western sanctions have piled up and Iran’s economy has been strangled, hard-liners have occasionally suggested that the country has gained nothing from this posture and might be better off following the “North Korea model”— that is, pulling out of the nonproliferation treaty and racing for a bomb as North Korea did in 2003. Until now, these voices have been quickly marginalized, as it’s clear the supreme leader does not share the sentiment. An early 2000s fatwa, or religious ruling, by Ayatollah Khamenei declared nuclear weapons to be “forbidden under Islam” and decreed that “the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never acquire these weapons.”
> 
> Mr. Raisi’s death has quickly and dramatically shifted the landscape. A regime that had already begun to drift into militarism and domination by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (I.R.G.C.) now risks moving more firmly into this camp. Some in the I.R.G.C. see the fatwa as outdated: One senior former regime official recently told me that the top brass of the corps is “itching” to engineer the fatwa’s reversal — and will most likely do so at the first opportunity.
> 
> Regardless of who wins the snap presidential election that now must be held by early July, the ultimate succession battle will be for the role of supreme leader, and the I.R.G.C. is likely to play a decisive role in the transition. The late president was seen as a front-runner to succeed the 85-year-old ayatollah. Now, other than Ayatollah Khamenei’s son, there are few strong contenders. Whoever prevails is likely to rely heavily on the I.R.G.C. for his legitimacy.
> 
> Historically, Iran has felt a nuclear hedging strategy is its best defense against external aggression and invasion. And Tehran may continue to calculate that racing for a bomb would only invite more hostility, including from the United States. Then again, an increasingly distracted and unpredictable Washington might not be in a position to react forcefully against a sudden and rapid Iranian rush for a bomb, especially if Iran chooses its moment wisely.
> 
> Between the war in Gaza, a possible change in American leadership, and a domestic power vacuum that the I.R.G.C. could step into, it is not difficult to imagine a brief window in which Iran could pull out the stops and surprise the world by testing a nuclear device.
> 
> Would I bet the house on this scenario? Perhaps not. But from the perspective of a historian, the possibility of an Iranian rush for a bomb has never felt more real than it does today.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWWliSTREQkhaYjJZa2FIZ1lvdjl5S1VHTVZWaThwRW4wYWQ4NmJQUzJWNXM3NXZyLWtUd3IwbVhWQXhJalM3cnlFTXNOdTF4NE83TEQ5TWRvYXdORnc9PQ==

This report is extremely revealing about how Israel has gone about displacing and harming Palestinians in the West Bank by supporting, abetting, and providing cover for settler violence. 

Israel's ethnic cleansing and illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank are perhaps the biggest flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So many destructive decisions and beliefs can be tied to it. For example, Israeli leadership's shunning of a peace deal and two-state solution since the status quo leaves it in power and free to expand settlements. Settlements are so important because they will be extremely hard to uproot in any potential peace deal, meaning Israel is tightening its grip on this illegally settled land. 

This section really stood out to me: 

>Sharon announced what he called Israel’s “disengagement” from Gaza, with a plan to remove settlers — forcibly if necessary — over the next two years. The motivations were complex and the subject of considerable debate. For Sharon, at least, it appeared to be a tactical move. “The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process,” his senior adviser Dov Weisglass told Haaretz at the time. “And when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.” 

This shows that even with supposedly peace-seeking actions like removing settlers from Gaza, Israeli leadership sought to cripple the two-state solution. Israel's continued violence and humiliating occupation and subjugation of Palestinians (as detailed ad nauseum in this report) has been the fuel that lifted up groups like Hamas and pushed Palestinians to seek violent means of resistance. In their view, Israel hasn't been a willing and open partner for peace. I strongly recommend that you read this extremely well-reported article.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjYy1HS3NNaktkMWFwNDgyOXZyRjI4LU1fc1hZTlpZMmpJYUh3UWg2RDJ1dndabHZTRVFSdmJhdTl2aDFBRUd4YUFQX3pJSmhoSk9DNGV2MmhyR3ZPaGc9PQ==
"The U.S. opposes a proposed global wealth tax on billionaires, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, rejecting an idea floated by Brazil, France and other nations to tip the economic scales away from the megarich.

“We believe in progressive taxation. But the notion of some common global arrangement for taxing billionaires with proceeds redistributed in some way—we’re not supportive of a process to try to achieve that. That’s something we can’t sign on to,” she said.

Along with ministers from Brazil and France, officials from Spain, Germany and South Africa have discussed a plan that would require billionaires to pay taxes worth at least 2% of their overall wealth every year.

Levying the tax globally, proponents say, would stop the rich from shifting their wealth into countries where they can avoid paying the tax. That would allow countries to raise more in tax revenue to finance other priorities and use the tax code to reduce income inequality, which has widened sharply in recent decades.

“This is exactly what we did with minimum taxation on corporate tax,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month. “It would be the same on the international taxation for the wealthiest individuals.”

Most countries apply their income taxes based on a person’s residence. The U.S., unusually, taxes its citizens on their worldwide income, already making it harder for Americans to escape taxation by shifting assets and earnings abroad.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjX1BSaU1uSVA5LVlQUGFkdThZQ3pKbmJZWmNEbTZiaEEyeUxDcC1SYmNiQUZUN09rakxXcEJSM0I1QnFEUWhGSWZ0ZUFjYzN5ZF9uNWpNdV9IbnR1VVE9PQ==

"AIPAC is just one of many organizations that lobby on behalf of foreign governments. AIPAC, like everything Israel, gets outsized attention for its efforts, even though other countries are much worse in this regard.

"Lobbying groups have a lot of sway in Washington. Campaign finance laws have allowed lobbying groups to have unofficial ties to super PACs, which help fund political campaigns to help elect candidates of their choosing.

AIPAC has existed for a long time now. Jewish Americans and Evangelical Christian Americans are the primary supporters of AIPAC. There are definitely other demographics among AIPAC’s supporters but those two groups are the most significant. (Although both groups share the same interest, they have different reasons… but that is another story). 

AIPAC can endorse candidates as a lobby group. Furthermore, it has ties to Super PACs that send money to candidates to help them win elections. AIPAC’s support matters in areas of the country with significant populations of Jewish Americans and Evangelical Americans. For a Republican running in a district or state with a large evangelical population, it would be wise to receive money from such Super PACs and an endorsement from AIPAC itself to win the election. Just like it would be for a Democrat or Republican running in a district with a historically large Jewish community. Think Senator Rick Scott and Representative Hakeem Jeffries.

There are really few rules that limit what causes a lobby group can advocate for in Congress. Americans founded AIPAC to advance the U.S.-Israel alliance. (You can look up the specific details of that history on Wikipedia or other websites). However, it wasn’t started by Israelis. Although some Israeli politicians and citizens may support AIPAC’s activities, it is still an American organization. Important to note, there isn’t “collusion” or any sort of conspiracy here. All of this is legal. 

Like AIPAC, there are other lobby groups that advance the “interests of other countries” like South Korea, UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc in the United States. Americans also started these lobby groups.

However! Even foreign governments themselves can lobby the U.S. government. Look at this Statista report on foreign government direct spending on lobbying in the United States in 2023:

> In interviews with more than 100 current and former officials from the United States and countries across the Indo-Pacific over the past year, many said that the next century was likely to be less dominated by America than the last. No matter who wins the next election or the one after that, they said, the nation responsible for today’s world order has been weakened by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the destabilizing effects of China’s rise on domestic manufacturing and America’s own internal divisions.
> 
> The world is changing, too, with more nations strong enough to shape events. And as the United States shares sensitive technology and prioritizes teamwork, many believe they are witnessing both a global reshuffling and an evolution in American power.
> 
> For now, they argue, the United States is adapting to a more multipolar world. It is learning to cooperate in ways that many Washington politicians, fixated on American supremacy, do not discuss — with an admission of greater need and more humility.
> 
> **America Diminished**
> 
> The United States does not tower over the world like it used to.
> 
> Since World War II, the U.S. share of the global economy has been cut in half. That is mostly because of Asia’s steady economic rise. China alone produces around 35 percent of the world’s manufactured goods, three times the share of the United States. Japan, India and South Korea have also joined the top seven in terms of output, giving Asia more industrial heft than any other part of the world.
> 
> America’s military superiority has been better maintained, but China, with a smaller budget and sharper focus on the Indo-Pacific, now has a larger navy by number of ships, a likely lead in hypersonic weapons and many more factories to expand military production if needed.
> 
> American democracy is also not what it once was, as measured merely by the declining number of bills that presidents have signed into law. The Republican Party has repeatedly held up budgets, drawing the president back from trips overseas, in addition to delaying aid for partners like Ukraine and Taiwan. Recent polls show that most Republicans want the United States to take a less active role in solving the world’s problems.
> 
> Yet both parties have struggled with how to tackle and talk about Asia’s shifting power dynamics and America’s limits.
> 
> “It goes back several administrations,” said James L. Jones, a retired Marine Corps general who served as national security adviser under President Barack Obama. “We’ve had a fairly long period of time where the United States has sent conflicting messages.”
> 
> The Obama administration promised a “pivot to Asia” that seemed to never come. The Trump administration’s foreign policy — with its mix of anti-China diatribes and abandonment of a major trans-Pacific free-trade deal — was seen by some countries as a sign of U.S. insecurity about the challenge from Beijing.
> 
> China had already become an economic colossus, the most important trade partner for most nations in the Indo-Pacific, and a major investor.
> 
> Countries across the region have also spent the past few decades producing millions of new middle-class consumers and expanding sophisticated industrial production, fueling a surge of regional trade that made the U.S. market less important while allowing more Asian nations to build tighter bonds.
> 
> Both confidence and anxiety have emerged from these broader trends. Military budgets across Asia have soared in recent years, and the demand for American defense technology has never been higher.
> 
> Yet many countries in the region now see themselves as players in an emerging multipolar order. “We are the main characters in our collective story,” President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. of the Philippines said during a keynote speech at the conference in Singapore. And as a result, they have turned to the United States less as a protector than a provider of goods (weapons), services (training) and investment (in new technology and equipment maintenance).
> 
> Japan has made the sharpest turn. From easing tensions with South Korea to pulling back from decades of pacifism with plans to sharply increase its military budget, to signing troop movement agreements with Australia and other countries, Tokyo has made clear that it now seeks a leading role in protecting regional stability. But even as Washington welcomes the move, Tokyo’s actions grow in part from a critical assessment of the United States.
> 
> During a joint exercise with the American Air Force in Guam last year, Japanese commanders said they were expecting to become more active because Japan’s neighbors wanted Japan to do more, implying broad recognition that America’s future role was uncertain.
> 
> “The United States is no more what it used to be 20 years ago, 30 years ago,” said a senior Japanese intelligence official, who spoke on a condition of anonymity to avoid offending his American counterparts. “That’s the fact of the matter.”
> 
> “No matter who the next president is,” he added, “the role of the United States will be relatively diminished.”

"> **America Adjusting**
> 
> American officials are aware of the world’s doubts. When told that some counterparts in Asia saw humility in the American response, a handful of Washington officials winced, as if lemon juice had been squeezed into their eyes. It sounded too much like weakness.
> 
> But some Pentagon leaders have been open about seeking what analysts describe as “co-everything” with partners — co-development, co-production, co-sustainment. And while U.S. officials have talked for decades about alliances in Asia, their tone and actions over the past few years point to a subtle shift, toward a more decentralized approach to security and greater candor about their concerns.
> 
> Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken delivered a speech in September that called for greater humility in foreign policy to face “challenges that no one country can address alone.”
> 
> Gen. David H. Berger, the Marine Corps’ top general until he retired last year, launched a sweeping plan in 2019 to counter China’s strengths by redistributing American forces in Asia, shifting to smaller units that are now more mobile, with access to bases in many countries.
> 
> In Singapore, a senior defense official said the formula involves more capable nations, investing in themselves, in partnerships across the region, and in working with the United States, which now accepts that it need not be at the center of every relationship.
> 
> Hints of that humbler America can be seen in large, multinational military exercises, where other countries are playing bigger roles, and in smaller projects,  such as a Pacific Fusion Center that opened last year in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu. A data hub for maritime analysis of threats ranging from illegal fishing to Chinese encroachment, it had started out as more of a U.S. operation until local partners demanded a role and American officials backed down and brought them in.
> 
> India offers a more layered portrait of America’s evolution, pointing to sustained U.S. interest in long-term, comprehensive plans for working closely with an increasingly confident New Delhi — even if that means quieting down concerns about its democratic backsliding.
> 
> In interviews, some Indian officials said that a turning point arrived when the Americans pulled out troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, leaving behind scenes of stunning chaos that suggested more input from the region would have been useful.
> 
> “The U.S. did very little consultation in the run-up to withdrawal, and started doing much more after that,” one senior Indian diplomat said.
> 
> In meetings at the United States Embassy in India’s capital, against a backdrop of congressional hearings on the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, American officials softened and talked more about shared shades of gray in their democracies. Diplomats from both countries said concerns about the Indian government’s promotion of Hindu nationalism or suppression of dissent were sanded down to: “We have a lot of commonalities — extremism, hate speech, disinformation. How are you dealing with it?”
> 
> Along with a change in how American officials talked about their own country came a broadening of how they saw India: not just as a huge market, with the world’s largest population, but also a multiplier for innovation.
> 
> India graduates more than 1.4 million engineers each year, on par with China. At a time when the United States has become worried about Chinese advances in electric vehicles, missiles, quantum computing and other technologies, India could offer a pool of talent to help keep up.
> 
> It all came together in a strategic defense and technology-focused agreement unveiled during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s state visit to Washington in 2023.
> 
> New Delhi was most excited about the co-production of fighter jet engines, which it had been seeking for years. But the White House emphasized in its own announcement that with shared investment in everything from nuclear energy to microchips, “no corner of human enterprise is untouched” by a partnership that spans “the seas to the stars.”
> 
> Pushed by other countries, the United States may finally be learning that a humbler approach can yield powerful results, said Ryan Crocker, a retired diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Kuwait and Lebanon.
> 
> “A certain degree of humility does not mean weakness,” he said. “We can’t do it all, we shouldn’t do it all. We have these relations and alliances, let’s figure out who does what.”
> 
> **The Risks of American Actions**
> 
> In conversations about America with defense leaders from the Philippines, Japan, India, Australia and other countries, there is often a hint of happy customers reviewing a bazaar.
> 
> The United States under President Biden has been selling and giving out quite a lot. Tomahawk missiles for Japan. Coast Guard boats for Vietnam. Improved runways for the strategically located island nation of Palau. Training for seemingly everyone in Asia who asks.
> 
> Is there danger in all that generosity?
> 
> Some analysts fear that America’s effort to spread its wares across a more fragmented world adds to the sensitive touch points for brinkmanship with China, raising the risk of a misunderstanding that could become a conflict.
> 
> “Washington’s pursuit of an increasingly complex lattice of security ties is a dangerous game,” wrote Mike M. Mochizuki and Michael D. Swaine, two defense researchers in Washington, in a recent essay for The New York Times.
> 
> Clearly, Beijing is not happy about the growth of U.S. partnerships.
> 
> At the Singapore conference in early June, China’s defense minister, Dong Jun, railed against what he described as “exclusive military alliances” that he said “cannot make our region safer.”
> 
> But if one risk of America’s collective approach involves doing too much, possibly sparking a confrontation, another could involve the U.S. failing to lock in enough from its partners.
> 
> There is a lot of ambiguity in the coalitions that increasingly define American power in Asia. How would the region respond if the Philippines stumbled toward a violent clash in the South China Sea? Or in a war over Taiwan — a center of the global chip business that China sees as its own lost territory — would the countries co-developing military equipment with the United States, or welcoming longer runways, actually spring into action?
> 
> It is also not clear how Washington itself would respond to Chinese aggression. And that uncertainty, according to many, is what countries are desperate to understand as they pull America closer.
> 
> “In the over 40 years I’ve known the United States, I’ve seen you go through troughs of being overly self-critical and waves of hubris,” said Bilahari Kausikan, one of Singapore’s most experienced diplomats. “One should not make the mistake of believing either is a permanent condition.”
> 
> The challenge for Asia and the world, he added, is that America is increasingly dysfunctional and “still indispensable”: No other country does as much to protect the order that other nations and economies need.
> 
> What’s changed is that a growing number of U.S. officials now acknowledge that more assistance is needed, from more than just familiar allies. In a time of disorienting challenges — Gaza, Ukraine, China, North Korea, pandemics, climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear weapons — their jobs now involve convincing others that humility can be as American as confidence and that it’s built into a strategy that will last, no matter who is president.
> 
> When Adm. John Aquilino, in his final days as the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, was asked what his typical day looked like during an event in Australia in April, he didn’t mention aircraft carriers, just allies.
> 
> “I spend a lot of time either on the phone, on email or on an airplane out to visit my partners,” he said.
> 
> Many of his counterparts in the region, he added, have each other’s numbers on speed dial.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SVlvd2FFWVNLMnZjejhiVnN1M01CM0k1QlpxYWxiRXNNeV9ZZnNESFFzajZmb0dvejVfVWpiUnFaY1ppTjJGWEV5cmNUMm9YRFdscGlnMDJ0c1ltcFE9PQ==
"> When Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy convenes the leaders of the Group of 7 countries on Thursday at a luxury resort hotel overlooking the Adriatic Sea, she might be forgiven for thinking her guests are seeking a refuge.
> 
> Except for Ms. Meloni herself, every one of the leaders is arriving at the meeting beleaguered, embattled or endangered — an ill-starred convergence that speaks to the political tremors rattling across the West. It also doesn’t bode well for the results of a gathering that already faced vexing challenges, ranging from Russia’s war in Ukraine to China’s global economic competition.
> 
> Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is three weeks away from an election in which his Conservative Party is expected to be swept out of power. President Emmanuel Macron of France has called a snap parliamentary election after his party suffered heavy losses to the far right in European elections.
> 
> Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and his Social Democratic Party were humbled in those elections as well, while President Biden is in a dogfight with his predecessor, former President Donald J. Trump. Even Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan faces rising unrest within his Liberal Democratic Party and may lose his job this autumn.
> 
> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, who faces his own disenchanted public after more than eight years in office, spoke for his fellow leaders when he lamented the surge of populism in Europe and the United States.
> 
> “We have seen around the world a rise of populist right-wing forces in just about every democracy,” Mr. Trudeau said on Monday. “It is of concern to see political parties choosing to instrumentalize anger, fear, division, anxiety.”
> 
> Anxiety about the role of the Group of 7 is nothing new: These seven countries account for a diminishing share of global gross domestic product. The leaders of China and Russia are conspicuously absent. (Russia was suspended from the group in 2014 after it annexed Crimea and left permanently in 2017.)
> 
> In a gesture to the changing world, Ms. Meloni has invited an A-list of non-Western leaders to Italy: Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, and the president of the United Arab Emirates, Prince Mohammed bin Zayed. She also invited President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Pope Francis.
> 
> Some of these leaders shoulder their own burdens. Mr. Modi was just elected to a third term, but his party’s parliamentary majority vanished. Mr. Erdogan suffered setbacks in local elections. While these leaders will not take part in the core sessions, some will hold separate meetings with Mr. Biden and other leaders, serving as a reminder of how power dynamics in the world are shifting.
> 
> Domestic politics will intrude on the G7’s business in ways large and small, according to analysts and diplomats. With Britain on the cusp of a vote that is likely to bring in a new government, Mr. Sunak is not expected to sign up to major commitments on trade with China or sanctions against Russia. Instead, his participation in the summit could end up being a farewell tour.
> 
> “How can you commit to anything if you’re going to have a change in government?” said Agathe Demarais, a senior policy fellow and director of the geoeconomics initiative at the European Council on Foreign Relations in London. “‘Wait and see’ is probably going to be the keyword.”
> 
> While Mr. Biden does not have to face voters until November, analysts said he, too, may be preoccupied by his election struggles back home, as well as by personal issues, including the conviction of his son, Hunter, on three felony counts of lying on a federal firearms application in 2018.
> 
> To a lesser degree, domestic politics may also constrain Mr. Scholz and Mr. Macron. Both are in more vulnerable positions after the advances made by far-right parties in European Parliament elections.
> 
> A surge in populism could divide the Western leaders on some issues and play to advantage of their biggest rivals on others. Far-right parties tend to be more hostile to free trade but friendlier to China and less supportive of harsher sanctions on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. These are all issues that will loom large when the leaders sit down on Thursday in the coastal town of Fasano.
> 
> The Biden administration has pushed Europe to impose higher tariffs on China’s exports of electric vehicles, batteries and semiconductors, as it did in May. It is trying to drum up support for secondary sanctions on Russia, a major escalation of pressure that would go after companies that do business there.
> 
> But Ms. Demarais said, “The Europeans know that Trump could undo anything that Biden promises.” And given their own weakened position, she said, “If they sign an agreement, there’s also a risk that they wouldn’t get parliamentary approval for it.”
> 
> Mr. Macron, having lost in the European vote to the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, dissolved the French National Assembly and called snap elections that will end on July 7. Though he will be president for another three years, regardless of the outcome, he is weakened and could be forced to share power with an opposition prime minister.
> 
> Political analysts have likened Mr. Macron’s roll of the dice to the fateful decision by David Cameron, the former British prime minister who is now the foreign secretary, to call a referendum on Brexit in 2016.
> 
> In Germany, Mr. Scholz’s Social Democrats finished third in the European elections, after the opposition Christian Democrats and the far-right Alternative for Germany, which swept the former East Germany. Mr. Scholz’s coalition partners, the Greens and the Free Democrats, also fared badly.
> 
> While Mr. Scholz is unlikely to call a new election like Mr. Macron, he is under pressure to do so. He and his government are deeply unpopular, their internal bickering a recipe for paralysis. German support is viewed as critical for tariffs against China, a major competitor in electric vehicles, as well as secondary sanctions against Russia.
> 
> Even before the political upheaval, Europe and the United States could not agree on what to do with the nearly $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves that are frozen by Western banks. The White House initially wanted to confiscate the entire sum to use in rebuilding Ukraine. But European countries balked, fearing that such a move would destabilize the global financial system.
> 
> Now, the G7 countries are weighing a plan to amortize the frozen assets to get Ukraine a quick $50 billion or so, and then use the profit and interest earned to pay back the debt over time. That would supersede an E.U. plan to just use the profits and interest for Ukraine. But there remain disagreements over how such a debt would be guaranteed if the assets are returned or interest rates collapse.
> 
> Diplomats praised Ms. Meloni’s attempt to reach out to new leaders, though Peter Ricketts, a former national security adviser of Britain, said, “It betrays a justified feeling that the G7 is an old grouping now.”
> 
> The clearest winner in all this may be Ms. Meloni herself. Though she, too, came to power at the helm of a far-right party, she has cultivated an image as someone with whom Europe’s centrist leaders can work. For three days, she will hold court at Borgo Egnazia, a resort favored by celebrities like the pop star Justin Timberlake, who married the actress Jessica Biel there in 2012.
> 
> For all the bickering over China trade or Russian sanctions, diplomats said the leaders were unified on the two great issues of the day: support for Ukraine, and for President Biden’s attempts to broker a cease-fire in the Israel-Gaza war.
> 
> “From the point of view of the leaders,” Mr. Ricketts said, “this is probably a welcome diversion from a difficult domestic environment.”",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2d0xZQmZJVVVtQi04all6SVlhQVUwS1ZxT2t6bXdBd01fN1FxOWNaSmp0c25IQzRNNnF2YWFBblhmZWlpanNjbGVGdDR6STEtLVZ6QTUwQUZMOWNzRmc9PQ==
"> President Biden will sign a 10-year security agreement with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Thursday, an effort to signal a long-term American commitment to the country’s future as an independent and sovereign state, an administration official said. But the accord could easily be upended by the coming American presidential election.
> 
> The deal — whose final details were expected to be announced later Thursday — will outline a long-term effort to train and equip Ukraine’s forces, promising to provide more modern weapons and help the Ukrainians build their own self-sustaining military industry that is capable of producing its own arms, U.S. officials said.
> 
> At the Group of 7 summit in Italy on Thursday, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelensky “will sign a bilateral security agreement making clear our support will last long into the future and pledging continued cooperation, particularly in the defense and security space,” the administration official, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, told reporters en route to the summit.
> 
> The accord is essentially an executive agreement between two presidents.
> 
> It is modeled on the kind of long-term security agreements that the United States has with Israel. But the “Israel model” is based on a congressional agreement to provide billions of dollars in aid. The agreement with Ukraine would carry a commitment by the Biden administration only to work with Congress on long-term funding.
> 
> Given the bitter monthslong wrangling over the $60 billon in aid to Ukraine that Congress passed this spring, there is little appetite for bringing the issue up again until next year. If Mr. Biden were no longer in office, that commitment would mean little.
> 
> The new accord does not commit the United States to send forces in to defend Ukrainian territory. According to two administration officials, it only requires the United States to “consult” with Ukraine about its needs within hours of any attack on the country.
> 
> NATO membership for Ukraine — which President Biden has opposed while the war is underway — might compel the U.S. to send forces if the country was re-invaded by Russia. That is one reason Mr. Biden has resisted.
> 
> While Mr. Zelensky is expected to embrace the agreement at a news conference with President Biden on Thursday, the Ukrainians are skeptical of these accords. Without congressional funding, the support is largely rhetorical.
> 
> Ukrainian officials often talk about the emptiness of the “Budapest Memorandum,” a political agreement signed in December 1994 in which Ukraine agreed to give Russia old Soviet nuclear weapons that had been based on its territory. In return, the memorandum committed Russia, the United States and Britain to seek help for Ukraine from the United Nations Security Council if it “should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.”
> 
> When Russia annexed Crimea two decades later, in 2014, Western nations said that Russia had violated its commitments to Ukraine, and they made a similar case in 2022, when President Vladimir V. Putin invaded the entire country. The Russians denied that claim, saying the accord had only committed them not to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine.
> 
> Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday night as Mr. Biden flew to Italy, Mr. Sullivan said that the situation was radically different today, and that the United States and the West had already provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in aid.
> 
> The new arrangement with Ukraine is not a treaty, so it does not require American security guarantees the way that mutual defense treaties with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines do. And because it is essentially an executive agreement, if re-elected, Donald J. Trump could abandon the deal, as he abandoned the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2SFYxSGhSLVB0QmFjRGFfM1I2LXJyeDhBeUVNWjJCNmN5eFBTM3J3WjFaLU5sV1lueThNMi1lOXFCSEdUakpzeklHQlp4LXRYLThwNnZaME1vdi1malE9PQ==

"Well the United States’ biggest win is probably the incorporation of the European nations, that were under the influence of Russia, into NATO and the European Union. U.S. foreign policy has also successfully recognised China as a threat in 2017, and is now seeking to contain its increasing presence in the South China Sea. As a result, AUKUS was established in 2021 and Japan is increasing its military might; and cooperating extensively with the U.S against China.
The reason these are victories for the U.S foreign policy establishment, in my opinion, are as follows. 
Firstly, the U.S has managed to keep the NATO alliance very much alive through incorporating most of the ex-Soviet republics (and other nations), which is now keeping majority of the European continent in tune with one another. Therefore, allowing a certain stability to reign over the continent which has not been seen before in Europe’s dark history. It is also worth noting that all the countries in NATO value each other’s sovereignty and support democratic values, which is an important matter for society in my opinion. I firmly believe that if there was no NATO or EU every European nation would go back to days of 18th century diplomacy where balance of power was a key theme and every nation would look to increase its power. The U.S could have easily dismantled NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union (as many people argued, such as George Kennan himself), nevertheless, NATO has survived and Europe is united as never before. While I am aware that the EU is not a project of the U.S, it is nonetheless, greatly supportive of the Union and definitely influences its politics in many ways.
Secondly, when it comes to the South China Sea, I guarantee you, that if it was not for the U.S backing of Taiwan; a war would have erupted in the South China Sea a long time ago. Countless lives would have perished and who knows what that region would look like. However, thanks to the United States’ increasing military presence in the region, a war in the South China Sea is not viable, as China will not risk going to war with the U.S. The U.S is deterring China from acquiring 90% of the South China Sea and is therefore upholding international law to which China is also ascribed too. Furthermore, the AUKUS alliance has given hope to the countries of the Indo-Pacific that their sovereignty will be respected and not violated by China’s ambitions. 
This is my humble opinion, I am aware that is a far from perfect opinion but I would love to hear feedback on my comment. So if anyone agrees or disagrees do feel free to share :)",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQnZmQTlwOTBZMGt4X2Fla045MEZnMXNoa2dNS2xUOHQ5OGZBLWE3RTRwZVRqQmUycllYUEE2SDgxNjNBRlZwYXd1ZFh4NkJJQ29XcG1Zb2d2MG9sb3c9PQ==

"> An intervention by the UK government at the international criminal court is expected to delay a decision over whether an arrest warrant can be issued against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes in Gaza.
> 
> Judges at the ICC ruled on Thursday they would allow the UK to make legal arguments in the case as they consider whether to approve requests made by the ICC’s chief prosecutor for warrants against Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant.
> 
> According to court papers, after the prosecutor made the requests the UK argued that the judges hearing the case must address “outstanding” questions about the ICC’s jurisdiction over Israeli citizens before deciding whether to issue the warrants.
> 
> The decision to allow the UK to submit arguments in the case has caused concern among some international law experts that Britain’s intervention is politically motivated and an attempt to reopen legal issues many argue have previously been settled.
> 
> In February 2021, a panel of ICC judges issued a ruling confirming the ICC had jurisdiction in the occupied Palestinian territories. The decision cleared the way for the ICC’s previous chief prosecutor to open a criminal investigation into alleged atrocities in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
> 
> However, last month the UK government told an ICC pre-trial chamber the 2021 ruling “did not determine” jurisdictional issues relating to the Oslo accords, the interim peace agreements signed between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel in the 1990s.
> 
> UK government lawyers argued the judges have to therefore “make an initial determination” over whether the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over Israeli citizens “in circumstances where Palestine cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over Israeli nationals pursuant to the Oslo accords”.
> 
> The arguments advanced by the UK echo claims made by current and former senior Israeli officials interviewed by the Guardian in recent months. One senior Israeli official insisted “the jurisdictional issues are not resolved” as Palestine “doesn’t have the powers to delegate [jurisdiction] to the court”.
> 
> Experts said the decision to allow the UK to intervene on this issue could cause delays to the arrest warrants case, though a former ICC official familiar with the 2021 case said the jurisdictional issues had been resolved and, if challenged, would be “dead on arrival”.
> 
> According to Mark Kersten, an ICC expert and criminal justice professor at the University of the Fraser Valley in Canada, “it would beggar belief” if the judges decided that Palestine, an ICC member state, “could not ask the court to address atrocities committed on its territories because of a moribund Oslo peace process”.
> 
> Danya Chaikel, the International Federation for Human Rights’ representative to the ICC, said the UK’s attempt to challenge ICC jurisdiction using the Oslo accords was “deeply troubling and unjust”.
> 
> She said the UK appeared to be “prioritising diplomatic relationships over accountability for international crimes” and that its attempt to challenge the ICC’s jurisdiction also failed “to address Israel’s noncompliance with the Oslo accords, particularly concerning settlement expansions in the West Bank”.
> 
> Responding to the decision, Clive Baldwin, a senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch, said: “The UK should not be leading the charge for double standards in victims’ access to justice. The next government will need to immediately decide if it supports the ICC’s essential role in bringing accountability and defending the rule of law for all”.

"> Capitals around the world had already been hedging their bets about a second Trump presidency, but that planning is likely to go into overdrive after President Biden’s halting debate performance, diplomats and analysts said Friday, with global leaders increasingly convinced that Trump will win and usher in a sharp break from Biden’s foreign policy.
> 
> Diplomats in Washington set up watch parties on Thursday night as they drafted cables to send to their bosses at home. Leaders in distant time zones got up early to watch Biden’s stumbles and Trump’s inaccuracies. And many emerged convinced that the current occupant of the White House will not be resident there much longer, as they considered how to calibrate strategies that would appeal to Trump’s zero-sum view of the world.
> 
> For leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others who calculate they might get friendlier treatment from a Trump presidency, the incentives to cooperate with a lame-duck Biden White House may fade, analysts said, as U.S. rivals jostle for advantage ahead of a change in policy. Top Biden officials had already been saying that they believed Putin was waiting for the outcome of the election before making any decisions about the future of his war in Ukraine.
> 
> “There is a non-trivial incentive for the Kremlin to gain ground before the Trump administration comes in and they have to at least pretend to negotiate,” said Constanze Stelzenmüller, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. Iran, too, may seek to position itself for advantage ahead of a potentially more confrontational approach from Trump, she said.
> 
> Even for U.S. allies whose view of the world generally aligns with Biden’s, incentives to play nice with Trump will increase, as happened during his presidency when NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg regularly praised the U.S. president for his tough language on other countries about their defense spending.
> 
> Trump bragged at the debate about Stoltenberg’s strategic praise, saying that “the secretary general of NATO said, ‘Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen.’”
> 
> World leaders were left to wonder about Biden’s future.
> 
> “Marcus Aurelius was a great emperor but he screwed up his succession,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on X, a rare instance of a sitting allied diplomat making a relatively direct, on-the-record comment about the debate. “It’s important to manage one’s ride into the sunset.”
> 
> As the debate was underway, diplomats and other global policymakers shared the same real-time thoughts as much of the American audience: Biden and Trump may be separated by only three years, but the current president’s comportment signaled weakness. And Biden’s policy arguments are unlikely to factor much into the vote.
> 
> “Initially, Biden looked completely lost,” one diplomat said by text message as the debate was still underway, speaking, like others, on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about the domestic politics of an ally. “As always, it doesn’t matter what you say but how you say it and how it looks.”
> 
> European politicians, who have long been the target of Trump’s most withering foreign policy criticism over trade policy and defense spending, said they would need to accelerate the planning and policies already underway to adjust for a Trump return to the White House.
> 
> “This night will not be forgotten. The Democrats have to rethink their choices now. And Germany must prepare at full speed for an uncertain future. If we don’t take responsibility for European security now, no one will,” Norbert Röttgen, a top ally of former German chancellor Angela Merkel, wrote on X.
> 
> Foreign leaders had already been pushing for audiences with top Trump foreign policy advisers and surrogates, trying to understand his possible policies and lobby for their own interests. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron visited Trump in Mar-a-Lago in the spring. Polish President Andrzej Duda dined with Trump in New York in April, a month after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with the former president.
> 
> Foreign visitors to Washington in recent days have been courting Trump’s camp. In addition to their meetings with sitting Democratic officials, they often seek meetings with conservative foreign policy strategists such as Keith Kellogg, who was former vice president Mike Pence’s national security adviser; Elbridge Colby, a Trump-era Pentagon official; and others who are known to speak to Trump about international affairs. Many have sought out panel discussions at conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, which has assembled Republican thought leaders to plan a presidential transition.
> 
> One senior European diplomat boiled his country’s Trump strategy down to three pillars: alignment with his hard-nosed China policy, increased spending on defense, and investment inside the United States.
> 
> “The process has been ongoing, I can tell you,” the diplomat said.
> 
> With Biden managing the substantial U.S. involvement in two major wars in Ukraine and Gaza, allies and opponents will be calibrating their own strategies around the American election calendar.
> 
> Trump promised as much during the debate, declaring that if he wins, even before taking office he would resolve the conflict in Ukraine and arrange for the freedom of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been unjustly imprisoned in Russia since March 2023. (A Kremlin spokesman declared Friday that Putin slept through the debate and that it was an internal matter of the United States.)
> 
> In the Middle East, hopes for a cease-fire in Gaza are diminishing and fears about a broader war between Israel and Hezbollah are increasing, as Netanyahu seems ever more likely to be able to hold on to office past the U.S. elections in November. Trump and Netanyahu had close relations when the two coincided in office, although feathers were ruffled when Netanyahu acknowledged Biden’s 2020 election victory as Trump continued to fight the outcome. Netanyahu has laced into Biden over what he says are the slow pace of weapons shipments — an issue the Biden administration contests but will continue to be fraught as the war drags on and the U.S. president’s prospects weaken, analysts said.
> 
> “Fairly disastrous. That’s the only way to sum it up,” said former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt on X. He posted a link to an analysis of Trump’s second-term foreign policy written by the European Council on Foreign Relations, which he co-chairs.
> 
> “I wish this @ecfr analysis should be less required reading, but that’s not the case. Now it definitely is required reading,” Bildt wrote.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFLXRKdGFwTGx1U005UnJmOWdZUTVqUFZYSjV3anFRVkRYX19hRlluWDdNUkswS0R2aElNSENhWm80M1dsYjFKakRsMkdhRGlDa0RQTU9qWUhnVzJpMHc9PQ==
"> The United States is in the midst of an intense diplomatic push to prevent full-on war between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, as the risks rise that either side could initiate a broader regional fight.
> 
> In recent days, U.S. officials have pressed their Israeli counterparts and passed messages to Hezbollah’s leaders with the goal of averting a wider regional conflict that they fear could draw in both Iran and the United States.
> 
> Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, met with several Biden administration officials in Washington this week, in large measure to discuss the escalating tensions along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. That visit followed one last week by Israel’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, and its minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer.
> 
> Also last week, a senior White House official, Amos Hochstein, who has assumed an informal diplomatic role mediating between the two sides, visited Israel and Lebanon. Mr. Hochstein warned Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran, that the United States would not be able to restrain Israel should it commit to an all-out war with the militia group.
> 
> Archrivals for decades, Israel and Hezbollah have frequently exchanged fire along Israel’s northern border. After the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7 triggered a blistering Israeli assault in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing at Israel, mainly against Israeli military targets in northern Israel to show solidarity with Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. The fighting has intensified in recent weeks, and Israel’s reduced combat operations in Gaza, where it has greatly weakened Hamas, have freed up more of its forces for a possible offensive in the north.
> 
> The nightmare scenario for U.S. officials would be an escalation in which, for a second time, Iran and Israel directly exchange blows. In another such round, the United States might not be able to control the escalatory tit-for-tat as it did in April.
> 
> For now, U.S. officials believe that both Israel and Hezbollah would prefer to reach a diplomatic solution.
> 
> During his visit to Washington, Mr. Gallant told officials in the Biden administration that Israel did not want a full-scale war with Hezbollah but that it was prepared to hit the group hard if provoked much further.
> 
> Among the officials who met with Mr. Gallant were Mr. Hochstein, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns.
> 
> “The U.S. priority is de-escalation,” said David Schenker, a former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the Trump administration. “Neither side wants a war.”
> 
> Hezbollah was formed with help from Iran to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon after Israel invaded the country in 1982. A much more formidable fighting force than Hamas, Hezbollah has amassed thousands of rockets capable of devastating Israeli cities.
> 
> American intelligence agencies assess that Hezbollah is intent on showing support for Hamas by striking across the border but has been trying to avoid giving Israel an excuse to launch a cross-border incursion.
> 
> U.S. officials believe the Israeli government is divided over the wisdom of opening a bigger front in the north. Some Israeli officials, including Mr. Gallant, argued after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that Israel should have responded by trying to destroy both Hamas and Hezbollah.
> 
> Mr. Gallant’s position has since shifted, according to American officials. He now says opening a new front would be ill-advised, the officials said.
> 
> But U.S. officials and analysts say the risk that the war might spread remains dangerously high.
> 
> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is facing growing political pressure to re-establish security in northern Israel, from which some 60,000 residents have been evacuated. Many are hoping to return to the area before the new school year begins in September, but most say they will not feel safe enough to go back as long as Hezbollah’s attacks continue.
> 
> Adding to the risk is uncertainty among the United States, Israel, Hezbollah and Iran about one another’s true intentions.
> 
> “There is a possibility of pulling this latest escalation and expansion of the conflict back from the brink,” warned Suzanne Maloney, director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. “But there are four actors engaged in a dangerous game of chicken and the prospect for miscalculation is high.”
> 
> “Many in Washington and elsewhere have underestimated the risk tolerance of the current Iranian leadership,” she added.
> 
> U.S. officials do not have direct contact with Hezbollah because the United States considers it a terrorist group. Mr. Hochstein delivers his messages to its leaders through Shiite Lebanese politicians informally aligned with the group.
> 
> “He carried a very strong message, which is that if you think that we can dictate what they do or not, you’re wrong,” said Ed Gabriel, president of the American Task Force on Lebanon, a nonprofit that supports democracy in Lebanon and U.S.-Lebanon ties. “You have to understand that America does not have the leverage to stop Israel.”
> 
> Mr. Gabriel, a former U.S. ambassador to Morocco, said he had direct knowledge of the communication. A U.S. official confirmed that Mr. Hochstein had delivered the message.
> 
> In addition to urging both sides to show restraint, Mr. Hochstein has been trying to persuade Hezbollah to withdraw its forces farther back from Israel’s border, as required by a United Nations Security Council resolution passed after a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah.
> 
> On Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised interview that Israel was demanding “the physical distancing of Hezbollah” from the border to remove the threat posed by the armed group.
> 
> “I hope we are not forced to do so militarily, but if we are — we will be up to the task,” he said.
> 
> A larger clash between Israel and Lebanon could be devastating for both sides. Israel inflicted so much damage on Lebanon in 2006  that the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said he would not have conducted the operation that launched the war if he had known the damage that would result. But Israel would emerge bloodied as well. Hezbollah claims it could launch 3,000 rockets and missiles a day, a barrage with the potential to overwhelm Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system.
> 
> And even if Iran did not become directly involved, its other proxy forces, including Shiite militias in Iraq and Houthi militants in Yemen, could step up their attacks on Israel and U.S. interests.
> 
> Analysts and officials say that a halt to the fighting in Gaza would be the surest way to defuse the friction between Israel and Hezbollah. But a recent plan to stop the fighting endorsed by Mr. Biden and the Security Council is in doubt following added demands by Hamas and equivocal statements by Mr. Netanyahu.
> 
> Mr. Hanegbi, Israel’s national security adviser, said Mr. Hochstein was optimistic that Israel’s plan to transition to lower-intensity fighting in Gaza after ending its offensive in Rafah could open a diplomatic window for a truce with Hezbollah.
> 
> “He believes that this will provide Hezbollah with a ladder with which it can climb down from its daily solidarity with the battle in Gaza,” Mr. Hanegbi said on Tuesday during a discussion at Reichman University in Herzliya. “And that means it will be possible to talk about a settlement in the north.”
> 
> One growing concern for U.S. officials is the welfare of American diplomats and citizens in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.
> 
> On Thursday, the State Department issued an advisory again warning Americans not travel to Lebanon and stressing that Lebanon’s government “cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence and armed conflict.”",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFREZBMmVSOE44ckF2MWJVYWF5WWF1Mms0X0ozempSVnRPNFpuVFh0YXp3Szl2WnVIUlZYUGRTWGY2blp1b1pCTVp1bGg2ekVUc0xkdlY4Q3pzSkFtWnc9PQ==
"> If Vladimir Putin got up early to watch the U.S. presidential debate, he might have called for a bottle of champagne to go with his breakfast.
> 
> It is impossible to imagine that Putin would not have loved what he saw and heard. His candidate, Donald Trump—a man whose election in November would guarantee Putin’s victory in Ukraine and open the door to his conquest of Europe and the downfall of democracy in America—appeared to move closer to victory in November. Meanwhile, Trump’s opponent, the only man who stands between Putin and Trump and their desired goals, seemed to struggle.
> 
> Admittedly, one of the reasons President Joe Biden seemed muted, especially at first, was that he had a cold. Another was that Trump produced such a tsunami of lies, that Biden hardly knew where to fact check or call him out first. It was a tactic straight out of the playbook of one of Putin’s favorite generals, soon-to-be-jailbird, Mr. “Flood the Zone with Shit,” Steve Bannon.
> 
> Compounding that particular challenge was that the debate moderators were absolutely inert, potted plants, never once challenging Trump on even his most egregious lies (about Dems wanting to perform abortions after children were born or that old favorite, whether or not there was fraud distorting the 2020 election results).
> 
> The result was a format that allowed Trump to go from one lie to another while Biden presented facts, that allowed Trump to present lunatic policies (like replacing our tax code with a universal tariff) while Biden offered serious ones, and for both to appear identical, the same.
> 
> There was barely any mention of Trump’s conviction on 34 felony counts—and when it happened, the debate was already half over. There was little reference to Trump’s civil suits. In fact, the most heated debate in which he and Biden engaged was over their golf handicaps.
> 
> Putin must have been lapping it up over his breakfast of eggs poached in the tears of kidnapped Ukrainian children. What a show these Americans make of democracy, he must have laughed to himself, and yet how quickly they seem to be moving toward ending it.
> 
> No doubt he then thought of the words of Nikita Khrushchev, who said, “We will take America without firing a shot. We do not have to invade the U.S. We will destroy you from within.” And, of course, who would the vehicle for the mission be but a man who embodied every flaw of decadent and corrupt American society, Trump. My useful idiot, he probably purred.
> 
> Trump did as he was told. He emphasized how many Ukrainians had died “for no reason.” He blamed the war on Biden not Putin. He said he would end the war instantly—and while he evaded questions about whether he would cede to Putin the land Russia has seized, Trump did not hesitate to revert to his old lies about Biden and Ukrainian corruption. When Biden pressed Trump about his desire to pull out of NATO…a desire that has been confirmed by former top officials in Trump’s administration like ex-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper…Trump dodged the issue.
> 
> Trump repeatedly made the case that America was weak and faltering. He suggested Europe was not doing its share. He even went so far as to blame the Gaza war (that Russia helped encourage as a useful distraction from Ukraine) on Biden.
> 
> Most importantly, in terms of Putin’s long term goals, Trump once again defended the Jan. 6 rioters, said the insurrection was the fault of Nancy Pelosi, and then refused to say he would honor the results of the 2024 elections.
> 
> Not Stalin, nor Brezhnev, nor his old boss Andropov had ever managed to blow up America’s system of government from within, to reduce confidence in it to the point that the main issue cited as a concern by most Americans is the future of democracy, and the candidate that they think, according to a recent poll, who would be best able to deal with that was…Putin’s poodle, Trump! Ha!
> 
> Da. Yes. He’ll handle it, all right.
> 
> Biden, in response, got the words right. If someone were to read the transcript of the debate, Biden did well. If someone were to read an article that included fact-checking of the candidates, it would be a disaster for Trump.
> 
> But Americans don’t read anymore. Instead, they get debates in small bites, howls on social media, Tweets, and Tik Toks. And the overwhelming reaction post-debate is that it’s a three-alarm crisis for the Biden campaign. Music to Putin’s ears.
> 
> We are now a big step closer to our goal because shallow Americans will be caught up in the optics of the debate and not the substance, because they will take a confident liar over a hesitant truth-teller every time. And because there is no way the Democrats will actually act on the fair criticisms of Biden’s performance or age, even though they have a bench full of excellent and capable alternative candidates—beginning with Vice President Kamala Harris—and make a change.

"> We think we have problems in the UK with the apparent lack of statesmen or women to run this country, but Joe Biden’s abject performance last night in the “debate” with Donald Trump is a worry not just for the US and the UK but the whole planet. What on earth will Vladimir Putin and the other evil tyrants around the globe be making of the leader of the only global superpower? The US president struggled to string a sentence together despite days of preparation, and seems to want the golf course rather more than the White House.
> 
> Our enemies will thrive on our weakness. At this moment, when the Western world teeters on the precipice of the next World War, the only person who can probably prevent it increasingly appears unfit for office. The person who would depose him might end hostilities in Ukraine by giving Putin the keys to Kyiv. Both may be able to run the US (at least with help from advisers) for the next four years, but they could set the rest of the world alight as they tinker in their own back yard.
> 
> We should have no say who the Americans chose as their leader, but as a “critical” friend and with our “special” relationship perhaps we have a duty to tell that friend what it looks like from the outside. I know it is often easier to see the splinter in somebody else’s eye rather than the log in one’s own, but at the moment the oak tree in Biden’s eye needs to be called out for what it is – very, very dangerous.
> 
> Putin is threatening nuclear war and his hand seems to be hovering over the red button. The axis of authoritarian nations - Russia, North Korea, Iran and China - is consolidating. It is America which dwarfs these countries in military might. It is the US which remains the world’s policeman at an increasingly tense and perilous moment.
> 
> At least when we had the chaotic Liz Truss as “commander in chief”, her tenure was short-lived. Granted, we now have the choice between a crushingly dull lawyer or a cocker spaniel like leader, ever chasing his tail and never catching it. But I would trust both with our “slightly” smaller “red” button, and I am sure our Armed Forces would, too.
> 
> The question which has stuck in people’s minds following this week’s Sunak-Starmer BBC debate was: Are you two really the best we have? That audience member ought to have considered the choice facing the US, a nation of so much talent where the demagogic and the frail will be on the ballot paper.

"> The pier built by the U.S. military to bring aid to Gaza has been removed due to weather to protect it, and the U.S. is considering not re-installing it unless the aid begins flowing out into the population again, several U.S. officials said Friday.
> 
> While the military has helped deliver desperately needed food through the pier, the vast majority of it is still sitting in the adjacent storage yard because of the difficulty that agencies have had moving it to areas in Gaza where it is most needed, and that storage area is almost full.
> 
> The pier has been used to get more than 19.4 million pounds, or 8.6 million kilograms, of food into Gaza but has faced multiple setbacks. Rough seas damaged the pier just days into its initial operations, forcing the military to remove it temporarily for repairs and then reinstall it.
> 
> U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements, said the military could reinstall the pier once the bad weather passes in the coming days, but the final decision on whether to reinstall it hasn’t been made.
> 
> Sabrina Singh, a Pentagon spokeswoman, acknowledged that she doesn’t know when the pier will be reinstalled.
> 
> She also said Friday that there is a need for more aid to come into Cyprus and be transported to the pier. She noted that the secure area onshore is “pretty close to full,” but that the intention is still to get aid into Gaza by all means necessary. She said the U.S. is having discussions with the aid agencies about the distribution of the food.
> 
> The big challenge has been that humanitarian convoys have stopped carrying the aid from the pier’s storage area further into Gaza, to get it into civilian hands, because they have come under attack.
> 
> The U.N., which has the widest reach in delivering aid to starving Palestinians, on June 9 paused the distribution of food and other emergency supplies that had arrived through the pier. The pause came after the Israeli military used an area near the pier to fly out rescued hostages after a raid that killed more than 270 Palestinians, prompting a U.N. security review over concerns that aid workers’ safety and neutrality may have compromised.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFcDZXRTBMZW96OUsyaGxyc21PSmo5ZkhITmdxLS1hbFR0cDBUOWNKUlIxMW9xSG9RWUFyNTFLRC1Zamp3aTdjYmdrUVJMS0NjTlhnYVRHZmFvNU4tcmc9PQ==
"> Amid a faltering performance by President Biden in the presidential debate Thursday night, former President Donald J. Trump caused anxiety among America’s allies with a simple shrug.
> 
> Mr. Trump has regularly disparaged NATO and even threatened to withdraw the United States from it, and during the debate, he did nothing to assuage European concerns about his antipathy toward the military alliance.
> 
> Asked by Mr. Biden if he would pull out of NATO, Mr. Trump did not answer but shrugged.
> 
> “I was very worried prior to this debate and I’m even more worried now,” said Jana Puglierin, director of the German office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Trump may or may not want to leave NATO officially, but he has every means to undermine NATO.”
> 
> At the heart of NATO is Article Five of its charter, committing each member country to the defense of all the others. “Deterrence is all about credibility, and deep down, Article Five, has always been what you make of it,” Ms. Puglierin said. “So it depends on the U.S. president making it a credible threat.”
> 
> Given Mr. Trump’s skepticism about alliances, European nations that rely on the promise of American protection, she said, are worried he might try to forge bilateral relationships with Europe “and make them transactional.”
> 
> Camille Grand, a former assistant secretary general of NATO, said that in a second term, Mr. Trump would be surrounded by people “who want to turn his instincts into policy rather than saying, ‘This is a bad idea, Mr. President.’”
> 
> “But the worst thing is his unpredictability, and Europe is at war,” he added..In peacetime there is always another summit or a chance to build relationships, he said. “But in a war, if he suddenly suggests a peace settlement overnight or something that makes the U.S. security guarantee hollow, that’s much more difficult to manage,” Mr. Grand said.
> 
> Mr. Trump boasted on Thursday night that he had forced European countries to increase their military spending, though it has grown more under Mr. Biden. Already, Mr. Grand said, the Europeans understand that they have to do more in their own defense, and in fact are spending $130 billion more every year than they did in 2014, he said.
> 
> But whoever is president, “we need to make sure we can defend Europe with less America.”
> 
> NATO supporters were hardly the only international observers unnerved by the debate. The back-and-forth between the blustering Mr. Trump and the faltering Mr. Biden set analysts fretting — and not just about who might win the election in November.
> 
> Sergey Radchenko, a historian at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, wrote on X, “This election is doing more to discredit American democracy than Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping could ever hope to,” referring to the leaders of Russia and China, America’s most powerful rivals.
> 
> “I am worried about the image projected to the outside world,” he continued. “It is not an image of leadership. It is an image of terminal decline.”
> 
> Whoever becomes president, the United States faces major global challenges — in Asia, from a rising China and a nuclear North Korea recently bolstered by Mr. Putin; in Europe from Russia’s war against Ukraine; and in the Middle East, where Israel’s war against Hamas threatens to spread to southern Lebanon and even Iran.
> 
> There was little of substance on foreign policy in the noisy debate. Mr. Trump continued to insist without explanation that he could have prevented Mr. Putin from invading Ukraine, or Hamas from invading Israel, and that he could bring a quick end to both conflicts.
> 
> Mr. Biden cited his efforts to bring allies together to aid Ukraine and confront Russia. “I’ve got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea,” he said.
> 
> For some, the debate made a Trump presidency, already considered a strong possibility, seem like a probability, said François Heisbourg, a French analyst. “So on all the issues, the debate is a confirmation of European worries, and some of it has already been integrated into people’s thinking.”
> 
> “People hear Trump saying he wants to cut back aid to Ukraine, so this will move to the center of the debate,” he said, along with Mr. Trump’s stated fondness for Mr. Putin as a strong leader.
> 
> On Israel and Gaza, however, “I’m not sure it will make much of a difference,” Mr. Heisbourg said. “You can’t move the embassy to Jerusalem twice.”
> 
> Added to existing worries about the unpredictable Mr. Trump, which the debate only confirmed, is fresh anxiety about Mr. Biden’s capacity to govern. One of the harshest assessments came from Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister. In a social media post, he compared Mr. Biden to Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor who “screwed up his succession by passing the baton to his feckless son Commodus, whose disastrous rule started Rome’s decline.”
> 
> “It’s important to manage one’s ride into the sunset,” Mr. Sikorski added.
> 
> Across Asia, one of the most pressing concerns is how Mr. Trump could exacerbate widening tensions with China if elected.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York Times
> In Ukraine, the clamor about the debate reverberated on Friday.
> 
> Referring to Mr. Biden, Bogdan Butkevych, a popular radio host, wrote on social media, “His main task was to convince the voters of his energy and readiness to rule.” But, he added, “He wasn’t able to do it. Accordingly, the chance of his replacement by another candidate from the Democrats increases.”
> 
> Some took a measure of solace in Mr. Trump’s saying that he did not find it acceptable for the Kremlin to keep occupied lands. The Kyiv Independent, a Ukrainian news outlet, ran a headline that read, “Trump rejects Putin’s peace terms while Biden unnerves Democrats.”
> 
> Russian media portrayed the debate as a sign of American weakness and disarray. The result “is good for us,” Dmitri Novikov, a Russian lawmaker, said on a talk show on state television on Friday. “Destabilization inside an adversary is always a good thing.”
> 
> In Asia, the debate resurfaced serious questions about how U.S. politics might affect stability. Mr. Trump’s term deeply rattled alliances in the region, and nations hoping to see the United States balance China’s influence and undermine North Korea’s nuclear ambitions have spent the past four years trying to rebuild ties with Washington.
> 
> “It was clearly a Trump win and a nail in the coffin for the Biden campaign,” said Lee Byong-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul.
> 
> “We must now brace ourselves for a second Trump administration,” he added.
> 
> In Japan, a major American ally in Asia, officials have almost always been assiduous about declaring that they are happy working with whomever the United States elects. But Mr. Trump’s comments during the debate that he does not want to spend money defending allies are likely to revive anxieties that he treats international relationships as transactional rather than enduring.
> 
> “My guess is that the Japanese policymakers are thinking, ‘OK, it’s going to be Trump quite likely, so we have to cement institutional ties as much as possible so he can’t undo them,’” said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Tokyo. “That is like tying yourself to a mast that may be sinking very soon, so it’s a false illusion of security.”
> 
> India has worked in recent years to overcome a long history of mistrust, expanding military and trade ties with Washington. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi enjoyed warm relations with Mr. Trump during his presidency, the Indian establishment has seen in Mr. Biden a steady hand who understands how alliances work and how to contain geopolitical risk.
> 
> Dr. Tara Kartha, a former senior official in the National Security Council of India, noted that Mr. Trump is unpredictable and could shift positions — like changing his current hard-line approach to China if Beijing offers him better terms on trade. That uncertainty makes calculations difficult for India, which shares a border with China and a long rivalry with Beijing.
> 
> “We are now hedging with China,” she said. “Because you are not really sure what’s going to happen to the U.S.”
> 
> In China, the presidential debate was a top trending topic on the social media platform Weibo. Official Chinese media outlets largely played it straight, reporting each candidates’ remarks — and their lack of a handshake — without adding much commentary.
> 
> Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar, said that the debate had only reinforced something the Chinese government had long thought: No matter who the next president is, U.S. policy toward China is only likely to harden.
> 
> What was clear after Thursday’s debate was that few Asian analysts felt optimistic about the American electoral options.
> 
> “Where are the good ones? Where are the brave ones?” said Kasit Piromya, who has served as Thailand’s foreign minister and its ambassador in Washington. He added that Southeast Asian countries must have a foreign policy vision of their own.

"Some highlights from the article:

>* Israeli soldiers describe the near-total absence of firing regulations in the Gaza war, with troops shooting as they please, setting homes ablaze, and leaving corpses on the streets — all with their commanders’ permission.

>* Several sources described how the ability to shoot without restrictions gave soldiers a way to blow off steam or relieve the dullness of their daily routine. “People want to experience the event [fully],” S., a reservist who served in northern Gaza, recalled.

>* ""We’re here for the hostages, but it is clear that the war harms the hostages. That was my thought then; today it turned out to be true.”

>* The six sources — all except one of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity — recounted how Israeli soldiers routinely executed Palestinian civilians simply because they entered an area that the military defined as a “no-go zone.” The testimonies paint a picture of a landscape littered with civilian corpses, which are left to rot or be eaten by stray animals; the army only hides them from view ahead of the arrival of international aid convoys, so that “images of people in advanced stages of decay don’t come out.” Two of the soldiers also testified to a systematic policy of setting Palestinian homes on fire after occupying them.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQUWV6MXhhcHkwYUNxck5HSi1lV2lDVlR2UHN3dU5aM2pJMV94dzFmaU5kTFRXcTd6LV82NHgzdndBTGs3LTdUb0tzSzg0eGRjMUJNREQtLUhDTXBNUHc9PQ==

"> The US government has blocked a British court hearing from taking place on a British territory, citing security concerns, according to official documents.
> 
> The supreme court of British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) was due to hold a hearing this week, attended by the BBC, on whether a group of migrants was being unlawfully detained on the island of Diego Garcia.
> 
> The island hosts a secretive UK-US military base and access is heavily restricted.
> 
> The US last week said it was “withdrawing its consent” for lawyers representing the migrants and “members of the press” - the BBC - to access the island, according to official communications we have seen.
> 
> It said it would not allow participants of the hearing to board US military flights to Diego Garcia and would not provide “housing, transportation, and food for the visit”.
> 
> The US said it would be “willing to reconsider” if the visit was “conducted in a manner” that addressed its “security and operational concerns”.
> 
> Dozens of migrants arrived on the island in October 2021, saying they had been fleeing persecution and trying to sail to Canada to claim asylum when their boat ran into trouble near Diego Garcia.
> 
> Late last Thursday night - hours before the judge, UK government lawyers and those representing the migrants, and the BBC were due to board flights for the first leg of the journey - the court shared an order cancelling the hearing.
> 
> The US security concerns relate to a site visit that had been scheduled to take place on the island as part of the hearing, which was to include the migrant camp and several other areas of Diego Garcia.
> 
> In a communication on 3 July, entitled “United States Notification to the United Kingdom of denial of the 6-12 July 2024 visit by of [sic] the Biot Supreme Court to Diego Garcia”, US authorities said the site visit presented “risks to the security and effective operation” of the base.
> 
> It had previously said it was willing to allow access to areas including the migrant camp, beaches around it and a chapel where children receive schooling.
> 
> But it had said it would not provide access to areas “open to civilian contractors and other non-military personnel”, such as a movie theatre, a barber and a bowling centre, the airport terminal and “all US-controlled areas occupied by the Biot administration, the Royal Overseas Police, and the Royal Navy”.
> 
> Court documents filed on behalf of Biot’s commissioner state that the reasons for the island's US military commander's decision were “confidential and based on the US’s assessment of its own national security needs”.
> 
> Tom Short, a lawyer from the UK firm Leigh Day which is representing some of the migrants, said the cancellation of this week’s hearing had been “a devastating blow to our vulnerable clients”, and called for it to be rearranged as soon as possible.
> 
> “Our clients have ceded to US demands that the site visit exclude certain US-controlled buildings (such as the gym and swimming pool where US cheerleaders and celebrity chefs visited earlier this year) as well as facilities such as the Turner Club and Golf Club (which Biot and FCDO civil servants frequent).
> 
> “It is of paramount importance to our clients that the Judge see the detention camp and that they attend a hearing in person,” he added.
> 
> A virtual court hearing on Tuesday, attended by lawyers in London and the migrants in Diego Garcia, sought to determine the next steps in the case as discussions between the UK and US governments continue.
> 
> Speaking after the hearing, migrants told the BBC of their disappointment at this week’s hearing being cancelled.
> 
> “It has taken away all our hope,” one woman said. “We have been stuck in this place for almost three years. We were hoping that this hearing would provide us some relief.”
> 
> The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, of which Diego Garcia is part, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965. It went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the military base.
> 
> Agreements signed in 1966 allowed for an initial 50-year period of US use of the territory, plus a further 20 years. The agreement was then “rolled over” in 2016, and is now set to expire in 2036, according to the Biot website.
> 
> Biot is administered from London but is described as being ""constitutionally distinct” from the UK.
> 
> Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, maintains that the islands are its own and the United Nations' highest court has ruled that the UK's administration of the territory is ""unlawful"" and must end.
> 
> Most personnel and resources on Diego Garcia are under the control of the US, including the majority of the accommodation and transport on the island as well as restaurants and shops.
> 
> The US military commander can refuse access to areas operated or controlled by the US military for security reasons.
> 
> In a witness statement, Biot’s deputy commissioner, Nishi Dholakia, said it was not possible to “make alternative arrangements to replace the logistical support which the US was due to provide” in time for the scheduled court hearing this week.
> 
> The room where the hearing had been scheduled to take place was only usable with US co-operation, he said.
> 
> Biot's official website states access to the island is only permitted to “those with connections either to the military facility or to the Territory’s Administration”.
> 
> Diego Garcia has been described as an important strategic base for the US. Earlier this year, two B-52 bombers were sent there for training exercises.
> In recent decades, US planes have been sent from the base to bomb Afghanistan and Iraq.
> 
> The UK government has confirmed that rendition flights landed on the territory in 2002 to refuel there, though former CIA director Michael Hayden has denied reports that it has ever been used to house and interrogate terror suspects.
> 
> The dozens of Sri Lankan Tamils who landed on the island in October 2021 are the first people to file asylum claims on Biot. About 60 people, including at least 16 children, remain there - guarded by private security company G4S - as complex legal battles are fought over their fate.
> 
> This week’s hearing was due to be the first time that they would meet their lawyers in person. There have been multiple suicide attempts on the island, and reports of sexual harassment and assaults allegedly committed by migrants within the camp.

> Some migrants have been flown to Rwanda for medical treatment following self-harm and suicide attempts, and those with successful claims are waiting for a “safe third country” to be identified to resettle them in.

Now, three and a half years later, our allies are committing more to our common defense than at any point since the end of the Cold War, making both them and America more secure. There is still more progress to be made, but we are well on our way to building strength that advances U.S. interests and enables us to work together to shape the future of the international order.
> 
> Let’s start with the numbers.
> 
> As NATO meets this week in Washington, we are closer than ever to fulfilling the pledge that alliance members made 10 years ago, after Russia’s illegitimate annexation of Crimea, to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense. Twenty-three NATO members, out of 32, are expected to meet or exceed that target in 2024, compared with just nine in 2020, and five in 2016. This year alone America’s NATO partners — Canada and 30 European nations — will spend an estimated $506.7 billion on defense. That is an increase of $181 billion from 2020, compared with an increase of $70 billion from 2016 to 2020, during the previous administration.
> 
> These numbers will continue to improve. In 2023, defense expenditures of NATO nations in Europe and Canada grew by 8 percent. This year, they are set to grow by 18 percent. These are not just numbers on a page or a fancy accounting trick: In the next five years, our NATO allies will add over 650 fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, over 1,000 air defense systems, nearly 50 warships and submarines, 1,200 battle tanks, 11,300 combat vehicles and nearly 2,000 artillery systems to modernize their arsenals, making us all more secure. So indeed, Europe is doing more.
> 
> There are a number of reasons for this important shift. The president knew that we could persuade our allies and partners to do more — and spend more — if we strengthened and deepened ties instead of bullying them or threatening to leave the alliance. Europe, as well, was adjusting to the new security realities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
> 
> The good news is not confined to NATO. In the Indo-Pacific, our closest partners are also increasing their military spending. Japan committed to doubling its national security-related spending, including a 65 percent increase in military spending, by 2027. In 2022, South Korea announced a five-year plan to spend more than $260 billion on its defense, which would mean annual increases of 6.8 percent on average. And Australia recently announced that it would spend a record $37 billion on defense next year, with further increases planned over the next few years.
> 
> Our allies are also spending more on weapons platforms and munitions that are made in America. Combined with our own investments of supplemental funds for Ukraine appropriated by Congress, this funding is being used to revitalize production lines across the country and is putting Americans to work. We are manufacturing weapons that make the United States and the world more secure, while strengthening our economy.
> 
> The strength of the allied response to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated why NATO, a 75-year-old alliance, is still critical today. When the United States became aware of Vladimir Putin’s plan to invade, President Biden consulted with our allies and built a coalition to support Ukraine. Some were skeptical that Russia would follow through, but when it did, they stood with the Ukrainian people. America’s ironclad support for NATO reassured our allies that we would have their back if Russia attacked them. This allowed them to give Ukraine crucial air defenses and munitions that they may have withheld for their own defense had they believed that the alliance was hollow and it was every nation for itself.
> 
> This is the first time since World War II that our European partners have carried more of the burden than the United States in a major conflict. America has contributed many billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to help Ukraine defend itself; Europe has spent more. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks overall international support to Ukraine, the United States gave Ukraine $80 billion (74 billion euros) between January 2022 and the end of April 2024. Europe gave $110 billion (102 billion euros), including long-range missiles, the high mobility artillery rocket system, armored fighting vehicles, air defense systems and munitions.
> 
> The United States is leading a coalition of more than 50 nations around the world, a Euro-Atlantic community, which continues to provide Ukraine all manner of support, from weapons to humanitarian and economic assistance. It’s an unprecedented effort.
> 
> The Biden administration has sought to improve cooperation among our democratic allies globally to harness our collective strength, and the results have been significant. Our Indo-Pacific allies have come to Ukraine’s aid, while our European allies are taking a more active role in the Indo-Pacific region. Britain is helping Australia build nuclear-powered submarines. European and Indo-Pacific allies are cooperating closely with the United States to protect sensitive technologies critical to national security from being used by China against us. Partners and allies around the globe are speaking out in support of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and freedom of navigation and rule of law in the South China Sea.
> 
> More remains to be done. Our allies need to spend more. We must continue our urgent work of strengthening our defense industry and investing in innovation. We must continue to deepen our alliances and strengthen deterrence. We must keep working to integrate Ukraine into the Euro-Atlantic community to help support a long-term foundation for peace and stability in Europe.
> 
> We expect to make significant progress on all of these tasks this week at the NATO summit. Ultimately, the way to make America more secure and to persuade our allies to do more is to commit to our alliances and to work together to counter shared threats and to build a better world.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRZkI5b2szamV2RnJIWmZaNl9BVGxUenBYTnM1MURrQ3paWDdBenRjSXJjeXZBRW1uUXBpSWVuY0ExUUszMEJVUXFqWTZIX0YwOV9HZkVNT3ROMEZiTUE9PQ==
"Jaroslaw Kuisz is a political analyst and historian. Karolina Wigura is a historian of ideas. They wrote from Warsaw and Berlin.

> “I know it sounds devastating,” Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, said this year. “But we have to get used to the fact that a new era has begun: the prewar era.” Fresh from ousting national populists from power, Mr. Tusk is widely respected. Yet his words may come as a surprise. Considering the war in Gaza, Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine and conflict in Sudan, can we still speak of a prewar era?
> 
> Mr. Tusk, a former president of the European Council, could perhaps be accused of Eurocentrism. But his remark is right: We are not in a traditional war. Yet of all the conflicts currently playing out, the one in Ukraine — which pitches autocratically aligned Russia against Western-backed Ukraine — has the greatest potential to become a full-blown world war. For NATO members gathered this week in Washington, working out how to stop that from happening will be at the top of the agenda.
> 
> They’re unlikely to agree, though. For the two and a half years since Russia’s invasion, Western countries have pursued divergent, sometimes contradictory approaches to the war. Behind each country’s policy is a special perspective informed by history. It’s like a pair of glasses casting the war in a different light. As Vladimir Putin threatens nuclear escalation and Ukraine suffers further assaults, it’s essential that NATO members decide together how they should see the war in Ukraine — and how best to bring it to an end.
> 
> Some believe that we are on the eve of a wider war, experiencing an equivalent of something that happened 100 years ago. This is the view through Sarajevo glasses. In that Balkan city, on a hot summer day in 1914, a young assassin opened fire on Archduke Franz Ferdinand’s vehicle, setting off a chaotic sequence that led to World War I. That war, which was extraordinarily devastating, began somewhat by accident. The historian Christopher Clark has called the political class of the time “sleepwalkers.” Through a complex mix of emotions, offended honor and recklessness, they wandered unwittingly into war.
> 
> For those who see the situation through this lens, the conflict in Ukraine must not be allowed to become the equivalent of Ferdinand’s killing, the starting pistol of a world war. They speak in a pacifist tone: Attention, step by step we are heading toward a global, maybe even nuclear, conflict — even if no one actually wants it. The conclusion for them is simple. For fear of alarming Russia into an irreversible escalation, Ukraine’s military ambitions must be restrained and diplomatic negotiations sought.
> 
> These Sarajevo glasses seem to be worn most prominently in Germany. Since February 2022 Chancellor Olaf Scholz has strenuously made the case for supporting Ukraine, and his country is one of the most important exporters of material aid and weapons to Ukraine. Yet at the same time, with every new delivery, he repeatedly warns: At some point one drone, one plane may be too many. His emphasis is always on caution and the aim, ultimately, to find some sort of negotiated settlement. On the streets of Berlin during the recent European elections, posters bearing Mr. Scholz’s image promised to “ensure peace.”
> 
> Others wear an entirely different pair of glasses — call them Munich ones. Their historical point of reference comes from 1938, when Adolf Hitler demanded a part of Czechoslovakia and the European powers, in the spirit of appeasement, agreed to it. The annexation was meant to satisfy the appetites of the Third Reich, and so avoid a repeat of the Great War. But appeasement came at the expense of other countries, as Eastern and Central Europeans will tell you.
> 
> It also, on its own terms, failed. Appeasement collapsed like a house of cards with Germany’s attack on Poland in 1939, leading the rest of Europe and eventually the globe to World War II. This is exactly what Mr. Tusk seeks to avoid. In this view, naïve decisions result only in more victims and suffering, in more cities — Warsaw then, Mariupol today — burned and bombed to the ground. The mistake of appeasement must not be repeated, they argue. No concessions should be made to Hitler’s modern-day counterpart.
> 
> Apart from Ukraine itself and Poland, these glasses are worn by countries in the surrounding region: Finland, the Baltic States, Romania, Moldova. President Emmanuel Macron of France seems to have changed from Sarajevo to Munich glasses over the past two years. An initial advocate of negotiations and diplomacy, he recently gave a speech sounding the alarm over the threat from Russia. “Europe can die,” Mr. Macron warned in a strikingly Eastern European tone. The weakening of his authority, after the recent election, could disrupt this view.
> 
> What about Washington? The United States, of course, entered the world wars late: The buildup of both has little resonance on the other side of the Atlantic. Instead, America’s perspective comes from the trauma that drew it into World War II: the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. That unexpected assault, in which more than 2,000 U.S. personnel were killed, taught the United States that if it does not have a carefully calibrated presence in conflicts, it may pay a far greater price. The country resolved to never be surprised on its own territory ever again.
> 
> These Pearl Harbor glasses help explain America’s conduct throughout the war, where it has sought to support Ukraine as much as possible — up to the point where it would be at direct risk of retaliation. This accounts for the vacillating quality of America’s support as it wavers between more or less active approaches, always anxious about Russian escalation. The problems this has created, not least in the delayed aid package to Ukraine, are plain to see.
> 
> In 2024, we are not in Sarajevo, Munich or Pearl Harbor. But that does not change the profound effect these perspectives have. Each pair of glasses not only shapes an intellectual analysis of current events but also entails a strong moral conviction of being right, even superior. It is this feeling, rather than the mere choice of historical analogy, that can lead protagonists to close themselves off from listening to one another.
> 
> Yet there is a way to reconcile all sides. It lies in understanding that we are not in an old-fashioned prewar era but a new era of hybrid war. This multifaceted war with the West and its core political values is already happening across the globe, not only in Europe but also in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. And if there are not yet Russian drones flying over European Union countries, fighting is already underway on other fronts — if only, for now, in the form of disinformation, spying and hacking. The analogies of Sarajevo, Munich and Pearl Harbor are all useful for building a new perspective fit for the 21st century.
> 
> We are not condemned to repeat the past. Instead we can freely choose what action to take: This is the essence of belief in democracy on both sides of the Atlantic. “Nothing happens twice,” as Wislawa Szymborska reminds us in her wise poem. Our view is that NATO members should put the alliance’s arsenal of resources at Ukraine’s disposal to ensure Russia is defeated. That’s how we see things. In Washington this week, countries have a chance to take off their glasses, look one another in the eye and set a new course.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRdVlkUWhoUTlKWi1UbjdJeUNHbTVjTElBT3ZkR21LU01OSERwc2Vka3Mwd2JONDg3b3poZHpLVy1OaG96WEdHM1NMLWlkTUlOZDBDSnltYmcyRUgyaHc9PQ==

> What would Ike say now?
> 
> Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, NATO’s first supreme allied commander Europe, felt strongly that his mission was to get Europeans “back on their military feet” — not for American troops to become the permanent bodyguard for Brussels and Berlin.
> 
> “If in 10 years, all American troops stationed in Europe for national defense purposes have not been returned to the United States,” he wrote of NATO in 1951, “then this whole project will have failed.”
> 
> But as leaders of NATO allies gather in Washington on Tuesday for the alliance’s 75th anniversary, some 90,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Germany, Italy, Britain and elsewhere, making up a significant portion of the 500,000 NATO troops on high readiness.
> 
> America’s outsize presence comes not just in the form of troops. Of the $206 billion in military and nonmilitary aid allocated to Ukraine by countries around the world, $79 billion has come from the United States, according to the Ukraine Support Tracker database. Since about 1960, the United States’ share of allied G.D.P. has averaged roughly 36 percent, while its share of allied military spending has been more than 61 percent, according to a Cato Institute report. The supreme allied commander Europe has never been a European.
> 
> It is now becoming increasingly clear that Europeans need to shoulder more responsibility for their own defense. That’s not just because Donald Trump and an isolationist wing of the Republican Party complain bitterly about having to defend wealthy countries that, by the way, can afford social safety nets that America can only dream of because they don’t spend as much on their militaries. It’s also because U.S. officials are becoming more focused on the challenges posed by China, which will require an increasing amount of attention and resources in the years ahead, especially given the growing cooperation among China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
> 
> The United States simply can’t do everything everywhere all at once, by itself. The future requires well-armed, capable allies. The indispensable nation has to be a bit less indispensable.
> 
> Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, European leaders understand that they need to contribute more, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide of Norway told me. During his recent trip to Washington, he said Republicans relayed that Europeans have to take much more responsibility for the war in Ukraine because the United States has “bigger fish to fry.”
> 
> It’s starting to happen, but not nearly as quickly as it should. The NATO summit will no doubt celebrate the fact that 23 NATO members are expected to spend at least 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, up from just three members that met that threshold a decade ago. But it’s stunning that nearly a third of NATO’s 32 members still fell short of that spending goal, which was agreed upon in 2014. If Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Mr. Trump’s not-so-subtle threats to abandon freeloaders haven’t convinced them to pony up more for their own defense, it’s hard to imagine what will.
> 
> After all, European reliance on U.S. troops runs counter to what many Europeans and Americans say they want. Majorities in the United States, Britain, France and Germany believe Europe should be “primarily responsible for its own defense while aiming to preserve the NATO alliance,” according to a recent survey by the Institute for Global Affairs. Only 7 percent of German and 13 percent of French respondents felt that the United States should be primarily responsible for Europe’s defense.
> 
> Europe’s dependence on the United States is engendering growing unease on the continent. Finland’s former president Sauli Niinisto has called for a “more European NATO,” and President Emmanuel Macron of France has warned that “however strong our alliance with America is, we are not a priority for it.”
> 
> So why does this dependence persist?
> 
> Part of the reason is human nature. Why would allies invest in defense if Uncle Sam always picks up the tab? But another reason is structural. When NATO was created, European allies were just emerging from devastating wars that left them suspicious of — and even hostile to — one another. Somebody had to herd the cats.
> 
> That’s how the U.S. role in NATO changed from that of temporary helper to permanent protector. At first, NATO was like a policeman watching over a construction site; the alliance went hand in hand with the Marshall Plan. If Americans were going to help rebuild Europe, they had to make sure that Moscow didn’t steal their investment.
> 
> But by the 1960s, it had become obvious that U.S. troops wouldn’t be leaving anytime soon. The Soviet Union had swallowed up much of Eastern Europe, including the eastern part of Germany. That made West Germany key to stopping the Soviets, but few in Europe could stomach the idea of a strong German military after what had happened under the Nazis. So the Americans stayed put and protected Germany with their own troops and nuclear umbrella.
> 
> “The present system did not take shape because America had set out to become a kind of empire,” Marc Trachtenberg, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about the Cold War, told me. “The system came into being because U.S. leaders realized by 1961 that there could be no purely European solution to the European security problem.” The Americans, he said, were stuck in Europe.
> 
> Once Washington realized it couldn’t leave, it started calling the shots. “We are bound to pay the price of leadership,” McGeorge Bundy, President John F. Kennedy’s national security adviser, said in 1962. “We may as well have some of its advantages.”
> 
> That meant juicy defense contracts for American firms, which became a powerful financial incentive to keep a big footprint in Europe. It’s one reason Poland buys American tanks that are too heavy to cross Polish bridges and Romania buys fighter jets that are extremely expensive to operate and maintain. The U.S. military industrial complex profits from dependency. About 63 percent of the military equipment that European Union countries purchased in 2022-23 came from the United States.
> 
> At the end of the Cold War, Europeans tried to wean themselves off U.S. military might. In 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France attempted to create a European security system capable of acting on its own. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright nipped that in the bud in a speech that warned against diminishing NATO’s role, duplicating NATO’s efforts and discriminating against NATO members that weren’t in the European Union.
> 
> In 2017, 23 European countries started the Permanent Structured Cooperation on Security and Defense to work together on practical projects such as cyberdefense. That, too, got a negative reaction from the Trump administration, which warned against excluding American firms.
> 
> It’s no wonder that today Europe lacks the capacity to deploy the soldiers and equipment that NATO needs to defend its members, especially when it comes to specialized units such as air defense, intelligence and surveillance. John R. Deni, the author of a new report on NATO readiness, told me that NATO planners routinely come up short when they seek contributions of sophisticated systems, partly because so much has already been sent to Ukraine. “There is just not enough to go around,” he said. “There are still troubling gaps.”
> 
> Luckily, some European leaders are treating this with the urgency it deserves. At the summit, NATO allies are expected to endorse a new defense industrial pledge to scale up the production of weapons and ammunition. But NATO’s procurement plan relies heavily on American arms makers. That clashes with the new European Defense Industrial Strategy, rolled out by the European Commission in March, which envisions spending half of its military procurement budget on items produced in Europe by 2030. Once again, cats need to be herded. There’s a dire need for both institutions to get on the same page.
> 
> If they do, it will be a great step forward for Europe’s ability to assist in its own defense. In the past, Americans might have sensed a threat to their authority and sabotaged this effort to build up a European defense industry. But today, Americans, who are also struggling to ramp up their own industrial defense production, need all the help they can get.
> 
> “A stronger Europe means a stronger NATO and ultimately a more equal partnership between the U.S. and Europe,” said Rachel Rizzo, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center. “You want a peer relationship. You don’t want a client.”
>

"> The United States and its NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine should have an “irreversible” path to membership in the alliance and are enshrining the phrase in a document to be released during this week’s summit in Washington, U.S. and allied officials say.
> 
> While there is no consensus yet about Ukraine joining NATO, the strengthened language would show that there is movement in that direction. The United States was once deeply skeptical about whether Ukraine was ready to become a member, and while questions remain, more and more American and European officials believe that the country will eventually be able to join.
> 
> Officials say there could always be a last-minute change before the document is released, but that the member nations had reached broad agreement in recent days.
> 
> The document, the summit communiqué, will not lay out an exact timeline for membership, which the Ukrainians have been asking for, and will insist that Ukraine first prove it can manage corruption and abide by strong democratic and law-based governance — conditions also set for other alliance members, officials say. But it should be welcomed by Ukrainian officials who have been pushing for language along the lines of “irreversible,” they say.
> 
> U.S. and allied officials are negotiating the commitments they plan to make to Ukraine with new urgency, given the uncertainty over whether President Biden, a staunch opponent of Russia in its war, can win re-election this fall, according to officials in Washington.
> 
> The officials say it is critical that leaders of the 32 member nations gathered in Washington this week use strong language to signal that Ukraine has a viable path to joining the alliance, even if that does not happen immediately because of the war.
> 
> They also say the leaders must agree to concrete steps to ensure the alliance is the main organizer of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine rather than the United States.
> 
> Looming over the talks is the specter of a second Donald J. Trump presidency. Mr. Trump has expressed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, criticized Ukraine and expressed doubts about sending any additional U.S. military aid to the nation. And in his first term, Mr. Trump talked about withdrawing the United States from NATO.
> 
> Because of these concerns, officials and analysts say that “Trump-proofing” the alliance and aid to Ukraine is an important element of the talks this week. “Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full, collective support,” Mr. Biden said in a speech on Tuesday night.
> 
> The discussions include:
> 
> *     Putting wording in a communiqué on the path for Ukraine to join the alliance.
> 
> *     Committing to a specific amount of military aid for Ukraine and getting more member nations to increase their overall military spending.
> 
> *     Establishing a military command in Europe that would coordinate aid to Ukraine.
> 
> *     Adding lines in the communiqué that denounce China’s geopolitical actions and its close partnership with Russia.
> 
> Beyond solidifying foundations that could endure into a Trump presidency, the leaders are also trying to head off criticism from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, who last year accused the alliance of waffling on a promise to give his country membership.
> 
> But a more amicable version of Mr. Zelensky arrived in Washington on Tuesday. He expressed thanks for the support given to Ukraine so far while prodding the administration to continue relaxing its restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons in Russia and sending immediate aid.
> 
> “It’s time to step out of the shadows to make strong decisions to act and not wait for November,” he said in a speech, referring to the U.S. presidential election. “We must be strong and uncompromising all together.”
> 
> **Ukraine’s Path to NATO Membership**
> 
> The debate about the communiqué revolved around whether to say that Ukraine has an “irreversible” path to NATO membership and what conditions to attach to that.
> 
> As of Tuesday, allied officials had decided to include the word “irreversible,” but that could change before the document is released, officials say. The alliance grants membership only by unanimous consent, and U.S. and other officials have been wary of what Hungary might say. The country’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, visited Russia and China before arriving in Washington and is more sympathetic than other NATO leaders to Mr. Putin.
> 
> U.S. and allied officials say that in any case, a mutual defense clause in the NATO treaty makes it difficult to allow Ukraine in while it is at war. The alliance wants to avoid a direct war with Russia, a nuclear power.
> 
> Officials have discussed a way to avoid setting a strict timeline for Ukraine’s membership: by insisting that it must first be relatively free of corruption and have more robust democratic and law-based practices.
> 
> Some analysts in Washington who have pushed for greater support for Ukraine say that NATO leaders need to give the country concrete benchmarks.
> 
> “Obviously we need to accelerate Ukraine’s path,” said Alina Polyakova, the president of the Center for European Policy Analysis. “The problem is we’re arguing on the margins over terminology and semantics and not over the bigger strategic objective, which is how to get Ukraine into NATO as quickly as possible.”
> 
> **Committing to More Aid**
> 
> Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, urged top diplomats at an alliance meeting in Prague in May to commit to collectively giving Ukraine 100 billion euros in military aid over the next five years.
> 
> He could not get consensus. Now officials say they aim to announce that the alliance will give 40 billion euros of military aid to Ukraine next year, equal to the current level of assistance.
> 
> A multiyear commitment could have helped the alliance prepare for political uncertainty in the United States.
> 
> But even with a longer-term arrangement, there are no guarantees: When he was president, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear limits agreement, which were both negotiated by President Barack Obama.
> Increasing Members’ Military Spending
> 
> There is another numbers concern: Mr. Trump has often criticized NATO members for not spending more on defense.
> 
> The allies agreed in 2014 to spend at least 2 percent of their economic output, or gross domestic product, on their militaries. At the time, only the United States, Britain and Greece were meeting the goal.
> 
> During the 2018 NATO summit, Mr. Trump railed against allies for that failure and then surprised leaders by demanding an increase of the benchmark to 4 percent, a goal that would have been out of reach for many alliance members. He said the United States would “go its own way” in 2019 if military spending from other NATO countries did not rise.
> 
> Mr. Trump so upset NATO leaders that they abandoned plans to hold a 70th anniversary summit the next year in Washington, fearing he would ruin it.
> 
> Mr. Biden noted in his Tuesday speech that in 2020, when he was elected, only nine countries had reached the 2 percent goal. Now, 23 of the 32 member nations will spend at least that. “It’s remarkable progress,” he said.
> 
> NATO officials intend to highlight that achievement throughout the summit.
> 
> “The best way for NATO to Trump-proof itself is quite simple: It is for every nation to meet the 2 percent of G.D.P. guideline for defense spending to which the entire 32 nations have agreed,” said retired Adm. James Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander for Europe.
> A New Command
> 
> To guard against any future decline of the United States’ role in supporting Ukraine, the alliance is setting up a mission in Germany to coordinate assistance.
> 
> After Russia’s invasion in February 2022, the United States took the lead in organizing military aid. That assistance has been coordinated through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which is run by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and includes representatives from allied nations. While that group will continue, NATO is setting up a separate office in Germany to coordinate aid of all kinds to Ukraine.
> 
> “The name of the game is to build up deterrence against Russia as strongly as possible in order to withstand a lack of U.S. participation, or, worse, attempts at or actual withdrawal,” said Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration who is now head of the McCain Institute, a democracy advocacy group.

"> **Keeping Asian Allies Close**
> 
> Creating a tighter web between NATO and Asia-Pacific countries allied with the United States — Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand — also helps hedge against any uncertainty that would arise from a second Trump term, Dr. Farkas said.
> 
> A U.S. president might find it harder to extricate the United States from commitments and partnerships if NATO and Asia-Pacific allies of the United States spoke with one voice on important issues, such as Russia or China.
> 
> Although Mr. Trump expresses admiration for Xi Jinping, China’s leader, he seems willing to appear tougher on China than Russia, such as when he imposed tariffs on some Chinese products.
> 
> Documents from NATO meetings of recent years have included language criticizing China. European nations have grown more suspicious of China because of its support of Russia. And they increasingly see China’s belligerent statements and military actions toward the democratic island of Taiwan as a kind of parallel to Mr. Putin’s hostility toward Ukraine.
> 
> The summit communiqué will have language that highlights China’s recent aggressions, officials say.
> 
> “NATO’s toughening language on China and its deepening engagement with four key Asia-Pacific allies of the U.S. reflect broadly shared views about Beijing’s assertive behavior and the linkages between security in Europe and Asia,” said Ben Bland, the director of the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, a London-based research group.
> 
> “However, there is a spectrum of concern about China among NATO’s European members,” he added. “A minority, such as Hungary, are actively courting deeper ties with Beijing, while heavyweights such as France, Germany and the U.K. are seeking to de-risk their relationships with Beijing but still remain reluctant to embrace some of the more confrontational aspects of Washington’s China policy.”",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRellsdEVMN2NtWlhCTjE0THhRRkRCZzlucmJVY3c2X2hISmVsa1NJcVppV0EtUzYwcDVLaUZRVUx5Z3p0c0xDQlo4b3pQRDF4OXVyaUo3a0R4NG9sWEE9PQ==

> In the high-stakes geopolitical chess game, Europe sits at a critical juncture. The US dominates. Its economic, large-scale industrial policy, tech and cultural influence spans continents. China advances methodically. Its economic prowess, decisive investments and assertive approach make it ever more influential. Europe, once a queen, now finds itself a pawn — moving with caution, struggling to achieve the unity needed to assert itself, often caught in national interest clashes and bureaucratic intricacies.
> 
> To succeed, Europe must be bolder. We will soon have a new European Commission and parliament and I strongly believe that Europe can transform, surprising everyone on the board.
> 
> The foundation for success is a Europe that controls its own destiny. The pandemic, geopolitical uncertainty, war and the climate crisis mean that the security, safety, and resilience we have long taken for granted can no longer be assumed. Investment in our defence and critical infrastructure is a non-negotiable priority, as is ensuring control over our energy grids, transportation networks, supply chains and communication systems.
> 
> But what should Europe do to quickly adapt to the evolving board? I believe that further incentivising the green energy transition, easing the implementation of new technology, and once again making the region a strong base for companies to innovate would be among the most transformative moves.
> 
> On the green agenda, we have witnessed substantial progress in the past five years with forward-thinking regulation charting the path to net zero. But global competitors are pulling ahead. In China, scalable green fuel solutions are hitting the market at an enviable pace while financial incentives and less red tape are helping companies expand their lead. Momentum is also building in the US, with the Inflation Reduction Act. In response, Europe needs an action-orientated energy strategy that goes beyond national divides and translates research, framework conditions and political visions into reality.
> 
> Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown the risk of energy dependency. Europe should now leverage the energy transition to create strategic autonomy. The EU’s “Fit for 55” emissions reduction framework lays out a solid foundation. But now it is time for more “carrot” — incentives and investments in industries that will dominate in the future. Simplifying the disbursement of funds and moving from financing one-off pilots towards more ambitious projects would be obvious levers to aid the production of renewable energy and green fuel at scale.
> 
> European companies like Maersk are making substantial investments in new technologies and assets that will accelerate the green transition. But a committed Europe also has a key role to play on the global stage. For example pushing the International Maritime Organization to agree on a price mechanism that will see those emitters who sail on fossil fuels pay extra while subsidising those sailing on green fuels.
> 
> Historically, Europe has been a thriving hub for innovation. However, productivity growth in the US has been more than double that of the euro area and the UK over the past two decades. US investment into innovation and research is also nearly twice that of the EU, while competitors across the Atlantic are propelled forward by Silicon Valley powerhouses and a thriving start-up ecosystem. China is making massive investments in AI, 5G and quantum computing.
> 
> While Europe boasts a rich history of scientific invention, the region remains cautious on tech, grappling with bureaucracy and restrictive regulations. Commanding new technologies is essential for anyone aspiring to tilt the playing field. Rather than adding more regulation, Europe should increase funding and incentives for research and development and establish more attractive conditions for investing.
> 
> If Europe is to achieve ‘open strategic autonomy’, it must switch on its private sector. One place to start would be to strengthen the single market, removing internal trade barriers and going for deeper integration. Europe should also move from a defensive posture of regulations and tariffs to developing competitive companies. We welcome the desire to address the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder business and must avoid self-sabotage through legislation that puts our businesses at a disadvantage and discourages investment.
> 
> As of now, Europe is not in check, let alone checkmate. But its lack of determination leaves it vulnerable. It must consolidate its pieces, streamline regulations, deepen integration and invest boldly. Otherwise, we risk becoming mere spectators in the high-stakes geopolitical match.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRX0pkRkV4V0VIQy00YkgwU0lSaVBjUUR6M2J4UlJ4b0p6a3pXUjE1M1huZTVla1JCOFR3UzBCb0s3dk5raE9zQWQ1eHJnWnhVbHlYSnQwWEQzektrM3c9PQ==
"> The first F-16 fighter jets donated to Ukraine are on their way to the country and will be flying as part of its air force this summer, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said, marking a significant military boost for Kyiv.
> 
> The US-made jets from Denmark and the Netherlands were en route to Ukraine, Blinken said. Norway also announced it would also begin deliveries of six F16s to Kyiv this year as western allies stepped up their pledges of support for Ukraine’s defence against Russia’s full-scale invasion.
> 
> “Those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,” Blinken said at an event on the sidelines of the Nato leaders’ summit in Washington.
> 
> The alliance is making a series of pledges this week aimed at “building a bridge” for Ukraine to eventually join its ranks.
> 
> The US on Monday announced it would transfer an additional Patriot system to Ukraine in addition to air defence pledges from other member states, while Nato is also setting up a new command centre in Wiesbaden, Germany to co-ordinate training and equipment donations.
> 
> Kyiv has long pleaded for F-16s pledged by western nations to be delivered as soon as possible. But shipments of the planes have been slowed down by the complex training of Ukrainian pilots and maintenance engineers required, while some military experts have doubted the effectiveness of deploying older F-16 models in Ukraine.
> 
> Fighter jets such as the F-16 are seen as crucial in bolstering Ukraine’s defence against Russia’s attacks, particularly given their ability to shoot down incoming missiles and potentially Russian aircraft used in bombing raids. Washington agreed last summer to allow the transfer of the advanced aircraft.
> 
> “We are committed to further enhancing Ukraine’s air capabilities, which will include squadrons of modern fourth generation F-16 multi-role aircraft,” the leaders of the US, Netherlands and Denmark said in a joint statement Wednesday. “We will continue to co-ordinate jointly in support of Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russian aggression.”
> 
> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is in Washington for the summit, said on X that the delivery of the Danish and Dutch jets was “a clear signal that Russia’s ability to terrorise Ukrainian people, cities, and communities will continue to reduce”,  
> 
> He added: “F-16s bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail everywhere and at any time.”
> 
> During an address at the Reagan Institute on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed 128 F-16s to match Russia’s air force. “Until we have 128, we will not be able to match them in the skies, and it will be difficult.”
> 
> The 79 F-16 jets pledged by Ukraine’s allies so far falls short of that target, however.
> 
> While Ukraine has long sought the fighter jets, analysts questioned how much of a difference the F16s would make because the donated jets are older models.
> 
> “The planes will be old with very old specification and no match to Russia in terms of radar capabilities,” said Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister. “So in radar battle, [those F16s] will lose and will be of quite limited use.
> 
> Nato members will also pledge €40bn of support for Ukraine for the next year in a bid to streamline commitments and also in a nod to domestic turmoil in many member states.
> 
> “We are able to provide more if we want to as individual member countries, but it’s more co-ordinated,” Elina Valtonen, Finland’s foreign minister, told the Financial Times on Wednesday.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRYVg2Y2RQTVJNZWFYcHY4SEdJUXBJOTZuYnE1a1ZPT2xlUHdySDhPTkhEYnVvVVNEckhEMi04bzhUaWczbXhyUkJGbVlyRG1rOU40N1BXd05fT2FJNEE9PQ==
"> The US will apply national security tariffs to some steel and aluminium imports from Mexico in a bid to stop Chinese metal entering the US across the southern border.
> 
> The White House said duties of 25 per cent would apply to any steel entering the US from Mexico that was not melted and poured in North America, while aluminium from Mexico that contained primary smelt from China, Belarus, Iran or Russia would face tariffs of 10 per cent. 
> 
> The move, which follows a string of tariff hikes on Chinese goods, is an attempt by the Biden administration to shore up support in former industrial heartlands, where he is losing ground to Republican rival Donald Trump in this year’s presidential election.
> 
> “Chinese steel and aluminium entering the US market through Mexico evades tariffs, undermines our investments and harms American workers in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio,” said Lael Brainard, Biden’s economic adviser.
> 
> Biden earlier this year also moved to protect US Steel from purchase by Japanese-owned Nippon Steel — a move Biden characterised as siding with American steelworkers. US Steel is based in Pittsburgh, in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania.
> 
> The US already has tariffs of 25 per cent in place on imports of steel and aluminium from China after the Biden administration tripled the US tariff rate on those imports in May. But the new levies would target shipments that enter the US after coming through Mexican ports.
> 
> The White House said the actions were being taken jointly with Mexico, which would ask its own importers to provide more information about what country their steel products were coming from. 
> 
> US trade representative Katherine Tai said the move was “good news” for both the US and Mexico’s steel and aluminium workers. 
> 
> US officials said the US imports around 3.8mn tonnes of steel from Mexico, with only 13 per cent melted and poured outside of the North American region and now affected by the new tariffs. 
> 
> For aluminium, the tariffs will apply to only 6 per cent of the 105,000 tonnes of imported aluminium from Mexico. 
> 
> Brainard said China was producing “more steel than China or the world can easily absorb”, and that subsidies were leading to “export surges” and “artificially low prices”.
> 
> In May, the Biden administration unveiled a suite of new tariffs targeting imports from China in the clean technology sector, including a quadrupling of the levy on electric vehicle imports to 100 per cent, a doubling of the rate on solar cells to 50 per cent and a doubling of tariffs on Chinese chips from 2025.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRYXBacTA5M3RDT0Z4WEJFRTBtTHF3aU91VU5HdVNhekp4SFV2UE1EeGxWaEtLQ2FpYURHZFpmZER1X01lMkdKMGlldXhFWDNGVkRrU1BGRGdfSi1zMUE9PQ==
"> “I have an unwavering belief that in 2047, when the country celebrates 100 years of independence, my country will be a developed India.”
> 
> Thus did Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, address his country on Independence Day 2023. Is his aspiration a feasible one? Yes. Is it a plausible one? No. But it is still likely that India will be a superpower by that time, with an economy, on one measure, as large as that of the US. So, how might India get there? What challenges will it face? What might it mean for the world?
> 
> I addressed the topic of India’s economic future in lectures last week at the National Council of Applied Economic Research and the Consumer Unity and Trust Society in New Delhi. I illustrated the challenge of becoming a high-income country by comparing India with the poorest country ranked as “advanced” by the IMF, Greece. In 2023, India’s GDP per head at purchasing power parity (PPP) was just under a quarter of that of Greece. If Greek GDP per head grows at a mere 0.6 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend, with IMF forecasts) and India’s grows at 4.8 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend), India’s GDP per head would only be 60 per cent of Greece’s in 2047. If its GDP per head were to match that of Greece by 2047, the rate of growth in GDP per head would need to rise to 7.5 per cent a year. That rate of growth would not be far below that of China from 1990 to 2012, when it achieved the astounding annual rate of 9 per cent. 
> 
> The picture of aggregate size is rather different. UN forecasts indicate that by 2050, India’s population will be 1.67bn, against 1.32bn in China and 380mn in the US. With more than four times the population, it will not be hard for India to match total US economic output. Indeed, if India’s GDP were to grow at only 5 per cent a year to 2047 (well below its 1990-2029 trend annual rate of 6.3 per cent), and US GDP were to grow at 2.3 per cent (its 1990-2029 trend rate, on a similar basis), India’s economy (at PPP) would equal that of the US.
> 
> The US would still be more technologically advanced and have far higher productivity. India’s manufacturing prowess is also unlikely ever to match that of China: the share of its industrial sector in GDP is not only far smaller than China’s, but is already in decline. Yet size matters: with its huge population and a big economy, India would be a superpower, not fully matching China or the US, but unquestionably a great power.
> 
> What might prevent this from happening? One reason might be the slowdown in global economic growth noted in the IMF’s April 2024 World Economic Outlook. The impact and extent of this structural slowdown (with China’s deceleration and demographic change elements in the picture) could be worsened by a big jump in protectionism triggered by Donald Trump’s possible re-election. In the longer term, the climate crisis might affect economic growth, as well as human welfare more broadly, as I argued last week. Also far from unimaginable is war among the superpowers. Against this, some hope artificial intelligence will reignite economic growth. But that is questionable.
> 
> A crucial point is that Indians will need their economy to grow at least twice as fast as global output. This means that its exports will also have to grow at least twice as fast as global output if the trade ratio is not to fall: otherwise, the economy would become ever more closed.
> 
> In a recent paper, Shoumitro Chatterjee and Arvind Subramanian argue against any renewed bout of aversion to trade. They note the widespread belief that “India is a large country with a large market”. But the true market size for tradeable goods and services is somewhere between 15 and 45 per cent of GDP, given the widespread poverty.
> 
> Again, some argue that “exports have not been important for Indian growth”. But exports have in fact been crucial, not least because they pay for necessary imports, increase competition and offer access to global knowhow. Finally, people argue that “global opportunities are disappearing”. But India’s share in world merchandise exports (excluding intra-EU trade) was a mere 2.2 per cent in 2022, against China’s 17.6 per cent. Even its exports of commercial services were only 4.4 per cent of the world total, far below the US share of 12.8 per cent and China’s 6 per cent.
> 
> Moreover, and crucially, India has strengths. It is an obvious “plus one” in a world of “China plus one”. India has good relations with the west, to which it is strategically important. But it is also important enough to matter to everybody else. It could be what the IMF calls a “connector country” in the world economy. Indeed, it can and should lead in the liberalisation of trade, domestically and globally. India also has the advantage of its diaspora, which is enormously influential, especially in the US. Not least, India’s human resources give it the capacity to diversify and upgrade the economy over time. It must exploit this. Size, in short, gives the country weight. India is not just constrained by the world: it can and must shape it.
> 
> What will matter most, however, is how India manages itself. Its biggest challenges are internal: maintaining stability; improving education; defending the rule of law; upgrading infrastructure; providing a first-class environment for investment; encouraging inward investment; and accelerating its shift towards clean energy.
> 
> The recent elections have made me more optimistic. The country should continue to have a stable government. But Modi’s BJP has been humbled. I hope this will persuade the government to focus its efforts on the economy and welfare of the population, rather than on India’s very own culture wars. India can be an influential and immensely important stabilising force in the world. We must all hope it rises to this occasion.",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNROVZmVTVjS2NCWGRUa05Oa3RzcUIxWnlBOUdJRzhjUHVaN1prU0MtVEJIajZHWWRZaXY1WHFRa25GQjRHU1NGUkVra192NXlYcTI3cV92b3hlRXZmTXc9PQ==
"> To Dublin, where “triple lock” has an altogether different meaning. In Britain, it is a rule that protects the real value of the public pension. In Ireland, it is a set of tests the government must pass to send armed forces abroad. If unpicking the British lock is too provocative for politicians to consider, imagine fiddling with the Irish one, bound up as it is with the republic’s non-belligerent self-image.
> 
> Yet the government proposes change. Allies have long nudged Ireland to do more, noting that democratic Europe has enemies who might not exempt a “neutral” state from their menaces. (Subsea cables near the Irish coast are candidates for sabotage.) And while Nato membership isn’t even a remote prospect, Ireland has signed up to a new co-operation scheme with the alliance.
> 
> In fact, Ireland, where support for EU membership amounts to a near consensus, is a good spot from which to observe one of the under-told stories in the world: the resilience of the west’s two most important institutions. Having been diagnosed “brain-dead” in 2019 by no less an eminence than the president of France, Nato is now wider, in that Sweden and Finland have joined, and deeper, in that member states are spending more on defence. Some are even mulling the revival of conscription. Whatever is missing from the alliance that convenes in Washington this week — a vigorous US president, for example — it isn’t a raison d’être. The Kremlin has seen to that.
> 
> And Nato might be the second most resilient Brussels-headquartered entity. A fact has got lost amid the (warranted) panic about Rassemblement National, Alternative for Germany and other nationalist movements. The EU is popular. And has become more so in recent times. Readers who find this implausible should take it up with various polling companies.
> 
> According to YouGov last month, a referendum on membership would result in a crushing Remain win in each of the large EU democracies. German support for Leave is 18 per cent. In Spain, it is in the single digits. Eurobarometer, a pan-continental pulse check, finds that 74 per cent of respondents now “feel” like citizens of the EU, against 25 per cent who don’t. Those numbers were 59 and 40 around a decade ago. The Pew Research Center reports that supermajorities think well of the EU throughout Europe (save Greece) and as far afield as South Korea, having not always done so.
> 
> Survey after confounding survey reveals the same trend: a reputational slump for the EU in the mid-2010s, amid the sovereign debt crises, then a recovery to remarkable highs ever since. It explains some odd twists of events in national politics. To get as far as she has, which isn’t far enough to govern France, Marine Le Pen had to soften her line on Europe. The Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, has been constructive with an EU that some expected her to fight. The return of Donald Tusk as Poland’s leader happened, in part, because his predecessors’ tiffs with Brussels sat ill with a pro-EU electorate. Across the continent, lots of voters with ultraconservative instincts on immigration, crime, net zero and, yes, Brussels, balk at EU exit, or anything close to it.
> 
> None of this assures the EU a serene future, or even a future. While populists didn’t sweep the European parliament elections last month, they did well enough to intensify their spoiling role. If a hard-right president leads France from 2027, he or she could wreck the EU as we know it without ever proposing Frexit. (Just as Donald Trump could undermine Nato without taking the US out of it.) In the end, though, all institutions rest on public confidence. And the idea of an existential crisis for the EU on that front is much harder to stand up now than it was circa 2015, whatever the surge of anti-establishment politics since then. Because, in Britain, someone who is nationalist in general will be anti-EU in particular, the Anglo-American intelligentsia tends to assume the same of Europeans. In fact, millions are able to decouple the two things.
> 
> Brexit helped. If Nato owes its second life to Russia, the EU is forever in Britain’s debt. Its great adventure of 2016 has gone badly enough to discourage the rest of Europe from even entertaining the same idea. Apart from its co-authorship of the single market in the 1980s, Brexit stands out as the UK’s kindest service to the European project. (Both happened under the Tories, which will gall that party to a degree that no landslide election defeat ever could.) What a parting gift. And how true, on such different levels, when Brussels says: “You shouldn’t have.”",r/foreignpolicy,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRbWRSVWJjTmJ6UkFhaFF4aFhQMkxoVmt0ZEhFRVRqbmIwcW1WdU80cDVBaXNENWlndFNucUZMdlVvdDJ3cHhWYVZyaHhJdUxXSXVqRnBWeGNmSUZVUFE9PQ==
"Europe seems to have lost its edge. The part of the world that once vaulted to technological, economic, medical, scientific and military supremacy and stayed there for centuries, has now turned into a cowering, self-hating parody of its once glorious self. 

 In the modern era of feeling bad for past successes and calling those successes atrocities despite that every single last nation in history would have (and often did) repeated many of the same moves, to achieve the same successes, Europe wants to take a timeout to reflect on how their past success was ill-gotten, undeserved and not really an achievement after all. Even though all the currently rising nations are achieving their own success by emulating the traditions and institutions that saw their ultimate genesis in Europe. 

There is no bite from any part of Europe west of Poland. There is no confidence. There is no national pride or grand projects to unite people. No unifying goals, no shared anger or joy. There are no victories to celebrate. No milestones to achieve, except for sad and often dubious enterprises like killing nuclear technology on the altar of climate change. 

And to top it off, Europe wants to transform its demographics to look more like the middle east and Africa which, while it may have some identifiable benefits, also represents in the long term the absolute erasure of their historical and remaining identity. This will lead to a more fractured, not more united, Europe. 

Is Europe on its deathbed as a coherent entity? What should Europe even aim for at this point, while it trembles before Russia and hopes uncle Sam, who they simultaneously need yet revile, will take care of any unclean business in Ukraine, the middle east, in the Pacific, anywhere, really. 

I believe in the potential of Europe existing, but it is currently dormant and being starved of oxygen by the self-hatred perpetuated by all the unhealthy ideologies, death cults and special interests that primarily just hate the success Europe and the west once enjoyed, and think we're always one statue toppling or one twitter user being jailed away from earthly paradise.
