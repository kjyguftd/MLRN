"You either side with a sovereign nation defending its people against a terrorist organization sending rockets at population centers (literally every couple days) for 20 years and then doing a 2500 person invasion to burn their babies alive and rape their women, or you side with the terrorist group.

Why the hell is this so hard for people to understand?? You don’t side with ISIS or the Taliban and going after a group like this is messy with a lot of dead innocent civilians, Gaza is no different.

The primary difference is that when it’s Jews defending themselves, the antisemitism ingrained in billions of people’s bones from thousands of years of Christian or Islamic influence comes out. People that aren’t from these cultures largely don’t have these hang ups.

Which makes sense- in both Christianity and Islam, you have two religions that basically say, “The Jews were on the right track but we came up with something better, and the fact that they don’t adopt it makes them evil”. Even people that grow up atheist in America are shaped by thousands of years of antisemitism that has been fortified in western culture.

I know this, because I am a Jew, I have been my whole life, and the fact that people whom I’ve known for decades will second guess every thing I have to say about history and culture, yet take the word of a singing Tik Tokker at face value, is because they’ve been brought up in a culture that inherently mistrusts the word of a Jew over a gentile.

**[Ukraine](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-january-13-2024):** 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

 

Howdy Folks,  

 

Happy Saturday!  

 

Today’s video is [Anders Puck Nielson’s recent release.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHcDdUTL6oc) He goes into detail as to US House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (his son monitors his porn use. (Yes, you read that right.)) request for a concrete US strategy is an impossibility. It’s interesting you’d like to watch an intelligent expert express perplexion at the inanity of American politics. He carries the same confused energy as the parents filming all those videos on [/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/KidsAreFuckingStupid/). 

 

Now let’s get to it, shall we? 

 

>A recent video appeal by a Serbian mercenary addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed discussions about an ongoing “clan war” within the Kremlin and the Russian information space against the backdrop of the Russian presidential campaign. 

 

 

Man, this Serbian thing isn’t going away, is it? Mostly I’ve been ignoring this drama because I expected Putin to take care of it relatively quickly. One to two days? Not a big deal. Three days and no resolution? Now I’m beginning to ask what’s taking so long.  

 

These Serbs, right? They’re serving under a VDV regiment, ostensibly elite, yet they’re complaining about mistreatment, lack of weapons, and suicidal assault orders. They requested transfer to a Chechen unit—keep in mind these are foreign volunteers—and were denied. Sort of. And when these foreign volunteers decided that enough was enough, Russia pointed guns at them and declared them guilty of treason.  

 

This is how the Russian army treats its foreign volunteers. Those considering signing that contract, beware. It isn’t worth the paycheck.  

 

I find this drama fascinating because of what it reveals about Kremlin politics, as well as the logistics situation on the Russian side of the line. Apparently these VDV units are *sponsored*; as in, an oligarch chooses a unit, funds its supplies, and its success or failure dictates their position within Putin’s pecking order. It’s honestly a clever twist on cruelty, simultaneously democratizing the expense of the war, while solving the critical question of corruption.  

 

Gee golly gosh, this sounds familiar. Where else have I seen keys to power responsible for supply, fielding, and maintaining a housecarl for contribution to the state in times of war?  

 

>In-fighting and factional dynamics within the Kremlin are not new phenomena and do not indicate the imminent collapse of Putin’s regime, particularly because power verticals are the foundation of Putin's regime. 

 

You’re damn right they are. Feudalism is an ancient system but a stable one. When one is king, one must be strong, yes, but how strong? The answer is always proportional to the strength and quantity of the vassals. Keep the vassals fighting, keep them too weak to dream of the throne, yet strong enough to be effective. This is the basic tenant of The Prince.  

 

[Robert Baratheon explains nicely the flaw in Putin’s foundation of power.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcy37C5SN0M) 

 

Putin needs to play this game every moment of every day. Each of his decisions considers this dynamic, so we can use this knowledge as a predictor of future behavior.  

 

 

 

>A fire destroyed a large warehouse in St. Petersburg belonging to Russia’s largest online retailer Wildberries on January 12. 

 

Burn baby, burn.  

 

At first glance I thought this was a result of Ukrainian Intelligence, yet that doesn’t seem to be the case. The story the Kremlin is releasing is that a fight broke out between several hundred laboring migrants, escalating to the point where military police needed to intervene. The fight apparently resulted in the warehouse burning and most of the work crew drafted to Ukraine.  

 

Things must’ve been pretty shit to have escalated to this point.  

 

 

>Russian forces are reportedly increasingly using chemical weapons in Ukraine in continued apparent violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is a party. 

 

Those mother fuckers.  

 

This is Russia putting its toe into the water. They’re using non-lethal chemicals, yet this is clearly to test the West’s response. How much pushback the Kremlin receives will likely dictate whether they decide to unleash the lethal stuff. The more desperate Putin gets, the more likely the chances he’ll unleash the truly horrific shit in the Soviet’s vaults.  

 

 

>Russian forces made confirmed advances near Kreminna and Avdiivka amid continued positional engagements along the entire front line. 

 

There’s been a marked decrease in Ukrainian offensive activity around Bakhmut recently. Avdiivka remains active, and the buildup continues in Kup’yans’k.  

 

ISW reports around Krynky Ukrainian drones are so dense the RF MoD needs to preannounce when their drones are active so their own soldiers don’t try to shoot them down. Tacitly admitting, of course, that Russia is not capable of flying drones at all hours of the day and night.  

 

 

>Russian forces launched a medium-sized drone, missile, and air attack against Ukraine on the night of January 12-13 using a strike package similar to recent Russian strike packages. 

 

Good and bad news here. Bad news first: twelve missiles out of forty got through. No idea what they hit.  

Good news: Ukraine neutralized twenty-eight missiles, twenty of which through electronic warfare.  

 

Yeah, apparently Ukraine has a new EW system that can neutralize inbound missiles. We knew this thing...whatever it is...could knock down drones, but this is the first time we’ve seen it deployed against a missile. Most of today’s knockdowns are attributed to this device, something domestically produced and not dependent upon the West’s largesse.  

 

Well done.

Okay. So apparently this is happening. I’m told Iran missed the US Consulate and instead murdered a prominent member of the Kurdish community. The word going around is that this guy was well liked, though that may be a disinformation campaign, perhaps with the goal of encouraging military action in Yemen. To be honest it’s getting really fucking hard to tell lately. The amount of misinformation swirling around is the worst I’ve ever seen it.  

Iran is trying to draw the West into a war. That much is clear. They’d like to make the war out to be our fault, and they’d like it if we put boots on the ground in Yemen. That is also clear. If both of these things are true, then Biden cannot allow himself to fall for this obvious trap. We need to find an alternative to blunt application of force.  

Biden should ignore Yemen and strike Iranian assets. That’s play here. The Houthis are nothing without their Persian backers, they take literal direction from the IRGC, so to resolve this problem we must strike at the root. It’s time to make Iran pay for their transgressions—not a lot, but this warrants a direct response.  

 

>[Donald Trump romped to a decisive victory Monday night in the frigid Iowa caucuses, cementing his formidable grip over the Republican Party and pushing the nation closer to a historic modern rematch with President Biden.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/01/15/trump-desantis-haley-iowa/) 

 

Yep. DJT won Iowa decisively. Somewhat surprisingly, Haley came in third, DeSantis in second. Here’s a helpful cheat sheet for the type who voted for each candidate:  

 

1. Donald Trump: MAGA-rabid fascists, foaming at the mouth with zealous bloodlust.  

2. Ron DeSantis: MAGA-rabid fascists, yet still able to hold a coherent conversation. These are the folks who aren’t in it for Trump, rather they think of fascism as more of a, “*Movement*, you know? Really get this whole white-power thing going. Grassroots.” 

3. Nicki Haley: Bog-standard conservatives staring slack-jawed at the staggering consequences of their own ineptitude. [Good job.](https://giphy.com/gifs/IntoAction-dXLnSpMDt7CvzRwMa9) 

 

But that’s not the takeaway. The takeaway is that Republican voter turnout to the Iowa Caucus was a historic low. That’s fantastic news. Despite the bravado, despite the chest thumping and victimhood, people aren’t excited to vote for Trump. They see the writing on the wall. Trump is going down in flames, and even the shit-tier economy, Biden’s abysmal poll numbers, and the GOP’s endless drama, less and less seem to think voting for DJT is going to help.  

 

Let’s hope this trend continues. We’ll know more as we move deeper into the primary.

>Ukrainian officials announced that Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft and severely damaged an Il-22 airborne command post aircraft on the night of January 14. 

 

Fuck yeah! The wins just keep coming.  

 

I have no damn clue how they pulled this off, but it sure-as-fuck wasn’t a Patriot battery. My totally ungrounded theory is that Ukraine spent several weeks clearing AA from Kherson Oblast, charted a path, and chucked an F-16 through the corridor to fire off an over-the-horizon strike on a bright-as-fuck radar signature. So, you know, if people start spreading that rumor know that you heard it here first. I started that disinformation completely unfounded and based purely upon supposition. [Call ‘em out on it and link back here.](https://www.nuttyspectacle.com/p/the-peanut-gallery-yeah-sure-whatever) It’ll help this place grow.  

 

Short-term ISW says the consequences for this shoot-down will mean a difficult time targeting strikes on Ukrainian assets in Kherson Oblast, strategic or otherwise. Long-term...who the fuck knows? Long-term hasn’t been a word in the Russian lexicon for almost two years at this point.  

 

 

>A senior Ukrainian intelligence official confirmed that Russian forces can generate forces at a rate equal to Russian monthly personnel losses, which is consistent with ISW’s assessment that Russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in Ukraine. 

 

Yeah, okay...so like 1k / day? But for how long? I have to ask. How long can the Kremlin continue to hide the effects of their crypto mobilization? How are they going to mesh this with their exacerbating labor shortage? Their declining demographic situation?  

 

These are all uncomfortable questions, both for Russia and for Putin. These are atrocious losses against an opponent purely on the defensive. Think about it, Ukraine isn’t attacking anywhere. Eight hundred a day is what the Kremlin now suffers baseline.  

 

 

>German outlet BILD reported on classified German documents describing a hypothetical scenario to prepare for a possible future conflict between NATO and Russia. Developing such scenarios, which are usually classified, is a normal task for professional military staffs. 

 

 

This thing hit the front page of /r/noncredibledefense today. I dismissed it at the time because...well, I was on /r/noncredibledefense. But apparently it was real. The plan is purely military worst-case-scenario thinking. It’s their job to war game this sort of thing. Still terrifying to think about, though.  

 

 

 

>Russia and Iran are preparing to sign a Grand Interstate Treaty to further develop Russian-Iranian military-technological cooperation. 

 

 

Okay...so is that going to be their alliance name? Kinda lame if you ask me. The Grand Interstate doesn’t have the same ring as the Axis Powers or the Triple Entente. Trust the Kremlin to give our generation the shittiest version of our grandparent’s defining conflict.  

 

 

>Russian forces made confirmed advances west of Donetsk City and near Krynky amid continued positional fighting along the entire line of contact. 

 

 

The lines are more fluid than they might seem. Confirmed advance means someone got to someplace new and took a photo; it doesn’t mean they held that new place, nor that they’re still there, nor that the attack succeeded. Nor that the place was more than a foot or two farther than the day before. It just means somebody crawled on their belly to take a picture in a new locale.  

 

That’s not why I’m bringing this to your attention.  

 

>Russian sources claimed that freezing weather conditions are inhibiting Ukrainian boat movements and landings on the east bank because the Dnipro and Konka rivers and channels are frozen.[79] 

 

[Are they fucking high?](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/Kherson+Kherson+Oblast+Ukraine?canonicalCityId=c50ea3afda07fb0c6afed484a2e7fe917a75babd7fff7bff690b97fdb693e8a0) Like, yeah, sure, the temperature sometimes drops below freezing, but it’s not exactly sub-zero, is it? And considering a river generally, you know, moves, it keeps a constant inflow of heat into the system to prevent icing over. The temperature has to be considerably below zero for an extended period of time for the fucking Konka to freeze.  

 

I wonder if this has anything to do with the bullshit excuse they gave about why they can’t put planes in Kherson Oblast, that it was “too cold” to fly a fucking jet.  

 

 

>The Ukrainian Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) stated that Ukrainian resistance forces detonated a Russian military UAZ Patriot vehicle in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, injuring four Russian personnel and killing an unspecified number of personnel. 

 

Hell yeah! Well done, GUR. It seems Melitipol partisans are alive and well.

Turnout was affected by the extreme cold they are having in Iowa, so it's a little soon to conclude that people are not excited to vote for Trump.

Howdy Folks,  

 

Let’s get to it.  

 

>Russian tactical aviation operations are reportedly decreasing near the Sea of Azov, and Russian aviation capabilities may be degraded after Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft and caused severe damage to a Russian Il-22 airborne command post aircraft on the night of January 14. 

 

Oh! I love me some consequences.  

 

Right, so there’s a flurry of narratives flying around regarding that craft—that Russian shot it down themselves; that Ukraine shot it down; that Ukraine didn’t shoot it down but it’s definitely down; Russia has ENDLESS replacements and it doesn’t matter that it’s down; to (and this one’s my personal favorite) Israel did it. I mean why not, right?  

 

The point is the A-50 is down and the IL-22M is out of action. We’re seeing an immediate, short-term effect where the Kremlin is hesitant to stick anything over the Sea of Azov. They don’t know why they lost their five jets last month, and they don’t know why they lost this thing. Without the vantage point the A-50 offered, the Kremlin will find it extremely difficult to fly anything over Kherson Oblast.  

 

I can't help but wonder, will the Kremlin keep winging about the cold into July?  

 

>At least two state-owned Chinese banks reportedly ordered reviews of their business with Russian clients and will sever ties with sanctioned Russian entities and entities with ties to the Russian defense industry. 

 

Man, it’s just one thing after another for Putin, isn’t it? This man is in a tailspin. Even Beijing is dumping his ass.  

 

The jury is still out on whether this will mean anything. Beijing and Moscow are tightly bound together economically. It's Russian consumption and fossil fuels which prop up Xi’s regime, which means there is a significant push in the West to divest from the CCP; this will mean declining import revenues; especially critical because China’s housing crisis seems to only be exacerbating. Given the censorship, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re covering up a devastating economic crisis. It's usually a bad sign when a [government ceases to release regular economic figures](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-stop-releasing-youth-jobless-rate-data-aug-says-stats-bureau-2023-08-15/). 

 

 

 

>Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to demonstrate that Russia is not interested in negotiating with Ukraine in good faith and that Russia’s maximalist objectives in Ukraine – which are tantamount to full Ukrainian and Western surrender – remain unchanged. 

 

 

 

The West offered an olive branch over Christmas. They spread the rumor of backchannel talks, they delayed aid announcements, and generally faffed about while Ukraine remained in a purely defensive posture. That was Putin’s out, his last chance of clinging to power. All he had to do was give up what he’d stolen and walk away. It’s an offer that’s likely still on the table.  

 

Putin don’t seem like he’s going to take it, though.  

 

 

 

 

 

>Russian President Vladimir Putin notably amplified a longstanding Kremlin effort to set information conditions for future escalations against Baltic countries, likely as part of his wider effort to weaken NATO. 

 

 

But why though. There is a conversation in Switzerland *right now* over what the world should do regarding the imminent collapse of Putin’s government. By threatening further war, during a peace conference, while Iran is chucking missiles, he is actively working against his own interests.  

 

People are unified by fear, by a common foe, and in attempting to intimidate us he is triggering that exact-same collective tendency. This tendency is what makes fascism work in the first place, which is exactly the ideology he is attempting to inject into his people. How he fails to make the connection is beyond me.  

 

 

 

>The Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada adopted a law on its second reading to digitalize Ukrainian military records on January 16. 

 

 

I consistently forget just how far behind in this war Ukraine started. They’ve really had a rough go of it over the last thirty years, haven’t they? Poor bastards.  

 

Modernization isn’t a quality of character, but it does demand solid institutions. Do the work, give a shit, and eventually the world becomes a better place. It’s how it’s always been, and it warms my heart to see Ukraine’s efforts pay off.

Howdy Folks,  

Nope, still not about F-16s. I’ve set my conditions: the Kremlin must demonstrate the ability to consistently drop glide bombs on Krynky before I’m willing to admit that supposition is incorrect. That hasn’t happened.  

Today’s correction has to do with a flippant comment I made on [January 15th](https://www.nuttyspectacle.com/p/the-peanut-gallery-yeah-sure-whatever) regarding ice along the Konka River impeding traffic of Ukrainian supplies to Krynky. I was wrong to call bullshit--turns out, I don’t know nothing about meteorology. [This guy](https://twitter.com/davidhelms570) does, though. He says the Konka is seeing significant icing over, and that the Dnipro will soon experience similar problems.  

This is important because ice along the Dnipro can interfere with Ukraine’s ability to deliver supplies into Krynky. Falling into the cold water and freezing to death is obviously a threat, though this is war and threats are to be acknowledged (not avoided).  

The real problem is the ice, which can complicate logistics while under hostile enemy fire. Ice shards can damage the propellers of landing craft and make landing of heavy equipment impossible.  

Special thanks to /u/NitroSyfi for the call out. At the end of the day, none of us know what the hell is happening, so it’s only through our collective pooling of experience that we can maybe, possibly, get a hint of what is going on. Please, everyone, if I am wrong, please speak up in the comments. By doing so you will improve /r/TheNuttySpectacle.  

For /u/NitroSyfi’s contribution I award them the flair *Probably Correct About Planes*. May they wear it with pride.

>Significant protests erupted in Baymak, Bashkortostan Republic, following a Russian court’s guilty verdict for a prominent Bashkort activist, prompting a swift Russian government response as well as backlash from the Russian ultranationalist community. 

 

Woah! That’s a spark.  

 

Several thousand people rioted in Baymak today in outrage at Fail Alsynov’s arrest. The charges are bullshit, obviously. Apparently this Alsynov fella called some other group of people ‘Black’ and that somehow means he deserves four years in a Russian prison. Seems excessive to me, but whatever floats the Kremlin’s boat.  

 

The problem is this dude was a prominent member of the significant Bashkort minority. His people turned out in the thousands—ISW estimates somewhere between 2k-4k took to the streets. Obviously the Kremlin cracked down hard with non-violent methods, yet the protest only seemed to dissolve once the local authorities agreed to release the 20-40 people they’d detained.  

 

This is significant because it implies the mob is highly organized, [relatively speaking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDFo2Iok06Y) Its leaders can disperse the protest at will, meaning they have respect and recognition by the community, so there is a semblance of a hierarchy. The question we’re all waiting on now, I suppose, is whether the protests’ll continue into tomorrow.  

 

 

>The Russian ultranationalist community will likely concretize xenophobia and insecurities about Russia’s ethnic composition as key shared principles within the community in 2024, as Russian ultranationalists continue to seize on incidents involving migrants and non-ethnic Russian groups to call for anti-migrant policies and express growing hostility towards non-ethnic Russians in Russia. 

 

Naturally the Russian ultranationalists seized upon these protests as further validation of their xenophobia.  

 

See, the problem playing the Hard Right is that they’re an inherently exclusionary bunch, and in a country as big as the Russian Federation, that doesn’t exactly work. “True Russians”, whatever the fuck that means, typically equals a handful of cities and Oblasts, so why they think they have claim to Ukraine is anyone’s guess.  

 

I swear to God, the Kremlin’s reason for this war has somehow gone from, “We’re going to liberate Ukraine from the Nazis,” to, “Blood alone moves the wheels of history!” These people are a nation of hypocrites.  

 

 

>Widespread Russian milblogger complaints about an Uzbek community leader in Russia prompted the Russian Investigative Committee to open a criminal investigation, suggesting that the Russian government may feel increasing pressure to respond to milblogger demands as the ultranationalist information space coalesces around xenophobic and anti-migrant ideals. 

 

The Kremlin is growing increasingly responsive to the milblogger community as the general Russian population appears to turn against them. Declining approval for the war, combined with the two protests over the last four months (today and the Caspian pogroms), there’s an increasing resistance by the Russian people towards Putin’s war.  

 

Xenophobia and nationalism might just be Putin’s best bet for retaining power, but in doing so he risks ripping his empire apart.   

 

>A Ukrainian intelligence official reported that Russian forces lack the necessary operational reserves to conduct simultaneous offensive efforts in more than one direction in Ukraine. 

 

Translation: Russia can do one thing at a time. If they’re active in one area, that’s likely all they’re focused on.  

 

Ukraine posits Russia’s current focus is gearing up in Kup’yans’k for another offensive, which, if they’re stupid enough to attempt, will fully occupy their attention well into March. It’s likely meant to coincide with Purin’s farcical election, perhaps climaxing with a victory / or / big-ass missile barrage the day before Russians go to the polls.  

 

Putin demonstrated time and time again that he cares more about optics than long-term military progress.  

 

 

 

>Ukraine successfully employed a Ukrainian-refurbished hybrid air defense system (FrankenSAM) for the first time. 

 

 

Woot! The FrankenSAMs are out to play! These things integrate Soviet AA with NATO ammunition, easing pressure on a finite, depleting resource: S-300 missiles. Because the West sure as fuck aren’t going to build those things.  

 

 

>Germany and France announced additional military assistance to Ukraine on January 16. 

 

And they’re *big* commitments.  

 

Germany supplied $5.9 billion in military assistance throughout all of 2023. Today Schultz pledged $7.63 billion. Fuck yeah, Deutschland.  

 

France, meanwhile, donated a whopping forty Storm Shadow missiles, along with “several hundred bombs,” whatever the ominous fuck that means.  

 

 

>The threat of US secondary sanctions is reportedly having a large-scale effect on Turkish-Russian financial ties. 

 

 

Contrary to what Putin was hoping, it seems the West is solidifying. Germany just ramped up their year-on-year commitment, France, the UK, and most of Eastern Europe are showering Ukraine in aid, and the US is putting the screws to Putin’s wallet.  

 

Good. These are all good things. Now if Biden manages to jam through an aid package before February I will be overjoyed.

I swear to God, fetal alcohol syndrome is a prerequisite for working in the Kremlin. 

 

>Russian forces recently made confirmed advances southeast of Kupyansk, and Ukrainian forces recently regained positions southeast of Kupyansk amid continued positional engagements along the entire line of contact. 

 

[So begins another Russian clusterfuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuhgHzuPYiI)  

 

To be honest, I didn’t think they were stupid enough to try it. I thought this might be a feint, a chance to build up their forces, lick their wounds, and take a breather—like an actual, honest to God breather. The Russian MoD haven’t had a chance to internalize the results of their Avdiivka fuck up, nor to disseminate the lessons amongst trainees. What is the new game plan? What will make Kup’yans’k different from Vuhledar, Bakhmut, and Avdiivka?  

 

To be clear, the information environment is still sketchy, but ISW appears confident there’s been a significant uptick in Russian activity in the region. Sure, maybe this is nothing, but in just a couple days the claim is Russia’s lost over fifty pieces of armor.  

 

If this actually is for real, like no play-play? Then this is it. This is Putin’s final offensive.  

 

Like I know what the media says—I know what US officials say (and trust me we’ll get to that), but I don’t see where Putin goes from here. He’s down to press-ganging migrants off the street, infrastructure is crumbling, and there are riots just north east of the Caspian. Like these are all signs the Kremlin is operating at capacity, yet the demand seems only to grow. Ukraine isn’t even attacking, not seriously. They are purely defensive, yet the Kremlin’s problems are constantly exacerbating.  

 

What happens when Ukraine presses the ‘Go’ button? What other resource can the Kremlin draw on? Putin’s tapped. He’s dropping plates, more and more lately.  

 

>Russian forces will be able to determine the location, tempo, and operational requirements of fighting in Ukraine if Ukraine commits itself to defensive operations throughout 2024 as some US officials are reportedly pressing Kyiv to do. 

 

Alrighty, we should get some shit out of the way first. Storyteller has many tendencies, one of which is the [tendency to favor aggression.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlmM7yoq59E) I don’t know how strong Ukraine is because ISW doesn’t assess their position. They focus their intention entirely on the Russian side of the lines, so I am not privy to Ukraine’s weaknesses. I look at 30 Abrams tanks and I think to myself, “Where the fuck have those been all war?” Then I look at headlines and I see everyone bitching about Ukraine’s weakness, with nothing specific to back it up.  

 

Like let’s look at the DoD’s statement critically: they do not think Ukraine should go on the offensive until 2025. We are in mother fucking January and they are making that statement. Am I supposed to take that seriously?  

 

Man, half of today’s text was the ISW outlining the phenomenal stupidity of the DoD’s suggestion. I earnestly feel the West is attempting to spin a ‘Ukraine Weak’ narrative in preparation of a crossing of the Dnipro, though I am aware it means discounting popular consensus and the public statements of most officials. It’s a hypothesis that demands *a lot* of assumptions, so I encourage everyone to lend it very little credence.  

 

>US officials reportedly assess that Ukraine will have to fight a long war and continue efforts to secure as much security assistance as possible for Ukraine before 2025 while expecting that positional fighting may continue in Ukraine until 2026. 

 

 

Yeah, so apparently the plan is to spend all of 2024 arming Ukraine for a *maybe* offensive in 2025, at least that’s the tone I’m getting from these weird-ass announcements. In fact the entire world seems to be playing possum, almost as if to lure Putin into a false sense of security. This whole thing might just be to trick him into kicking things off in Kup’yans’k. Yes, I’m aware it’s conspiratorial, but I just don’t buy that Ukraine is as weak as they claim.  

 

>Russia is trying to mend its relationship with South Korea to mitigate the impacts of its growing reliance on North Korea. 

 

 

Can’t unburn that bridge, bub. Sorry.  

 

 

>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree allocating funds for the search, registration, and legal protection of Russian property abroad, which includes property in former territories of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. 

 

The text of this law was apparently very vague as to what constituted “property”, which could just as well be a claim on anything the Soviet Union ever touched. Frankly, it’s a delusional decree, one not in respecting the sovereignty of their neighbors. It essentially announces they will loot anything they can get their hands on. It’s legalize pillaging.  

 

>Protests in support of an imprisoned prominent Bashkort activist continued in the Republic of Bashkortostan, but Kremlin mouthpieces denied reports that the protests are significant in scale. 

 

The Kremlin is tight lipped about these protests, meaning they likely want us to look anywhere but here. I say fuck them. I say we look closer. I say I’m going to make these protests the headline every day they’re up and about. These people deserve to be seen.  

 

Rumor is there were between several hundred to fifteen-hundred protestors in the crowd today. Last time the Kremlin laid in with tear gas and batons, only dispersing the crowd because a local official agreed to release the people they’d arrested.  Today they likely started with tear gas and batons and just escalated.  

 

Yet somehow the crowd stayed the entire day. Let’s hope they can do a third.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

About two days ago on a black, moonless night, I stumbled through a forest; undergrowth tore and scratched at my skin as I made my way, utterly lost. I fell down a hill. It hurt. Let me tell you, I was terrified. One cannot know true fear until they wander blind and without bearing...but such are the trials we suffer to avoid paying alimony, am I right fellas?  

Now I would have been stuck walking circles forever if I hadn’t spied a pale flash out of the corner of my eye. I followed it, naturally, only to find—and wouldn’t you know it—the goddess Selene herself, awol on the job and as lost as myself. I was about to step out and yell at that slacker to get her ass back to work, when /u/LaraStardust stepped from behind a large boulder to take Selene by the hand. Lara deftly guided the Moon between trees, over branches, and up treacherous hills--these things which were my bane.  

I followed them as best I could. They led me to a clearing, and it was there that Selene thanked Lara, reached up, and resumed her place as Foremost of the Stars.  

Anyway, that’s why I decided to give /u/LaraStardust their new flair: *Selene’s All Seeing Guide.*

>Russian forces recently advanced along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on January 20. Geolocated imagery published on January 20 indicates that Russian forces captured Krokhmalne (20km northwest of Svatove), and Russian milbloggers earlier claimed that Ukrainian forces withdrew from positions near the settlement. 

 

ISW isn’t ready to declare this an *official* offensive because they haven’t received pictures and videos, but it seems pretty clear to me that this thing’s for real. But both sides are reporting significant spikes in action, and when both Russians and Ukrainians agree that something is happening, I’m inclined to believe it’s happening. You don’t need to see video evidence, ISW—drop your standards. Not as low as mine, of course.  

 

Ukraine isn’t releasing results, so we don’t know how they’re doing on the defense. Word is the Kremlin’s dumping loads of armor into the assaults on Kupyansk, probably at least somewhat equal to what they were dumping into Avdiivka in the early days. For the Kremlin to be willing to launch an offensive they’d have to feel confident of their numbers.  

 

Likely the losses are obscene, as too they were in Avdiivka. They’d have to be to convince Ukraine to yield [Krokhmal'ne](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Krokhmalne/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4120e6bca1824865:0x170085de7e4a0480?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjwrLLE3O2DAxUFJUQIHRkCDTcQ8gF6BAg5EAA). Assuming this attack isn’t just an extremely vigorous probe, we can likely expect footage to start rolling in over the next couple days if it hasn’t already.  

 

>A Russian Storm-Z instructor claimed on January 16 that Rosgvardia personnel operating in occupied Ukraine have systematic issues with equipment and weapons storage. 

 

Yeah, because they’re Storm-Z. They’re the punishment battalion. Frankly it’s fucking remarkable they’re given guns in the first place. Were I in their shoes, I’d shit myself, then cap my superior officer. One in the dome and I’m off for the Ukrainian lines. Adios, muchachos.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin falsely claimed that Russia supports the “unconditional equality” and “sovereignty” of all states in a January 20 letter to the Non-Aligned Movement Summit, contradicting Russia’s official position on its war in Ukraine and its wider imperial ambitions. 

 
Putin claims a lot of things. I've learned not to take him at his word. 

 

>Russian energy exports to China significantly increased in 2023 amid increasing Russian reliance on oil revenues to manage the fiscal burdens of the war in Ukraine. 

 

Gonna be honest with you guys, I’m not a big fan of Xi. I know. I know. Controversial take.  

 

The thing is, though...a whole lot of suffering could have been avoided if China had just joined the rest of the world in protest of this clear barbarism. They are the sole pillar holding up the Russian economy. It’s Chinese products; Chinese goods and manufacturing; that’s what’s powering this war. 

 If Xi would just stop being a blistered twat for, like...a little bit, I would sure appreciate it.  

 

 

>European Union (EU) Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton stated on January 20 that the EU will have the capacity to produce 1.3 to 1.4 million artillery shells by the end of 2024 and will ensure that it delivers the “majority” of the shells to Ukraine. 

 

 

Hell yeah! Capitalism! When it works it works, y’know? Credit where it’s due.  

 

I’m grateful to Europe for their vivid demonstration of how to get one’s shit together. Hopefully we can pull an imitation over here in the states, politically speaking.

> Russian forces continued intensified offensive operations southeast of Kupyansk on January 22 and reportedly advanced. Several Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces continued efforts to advance southwest of Krokhmalne near Berestove (25km southeast of Kupyansk).[35] A prominent Kremlin-affiliated Russian milblogger claimed on January 21 that Russian forces advanced four kilometers deep along a 1.5-kilometer-wide front towards the Kotlyarivka-Kyslivka line (20km southeast of Kupyansk and just north of the Krokhmalne area), although ISW has not yet observed visual confirmation of Russian gains towards Kotlyarivka. 

 

 

Man, for Russia’s next “big offensive” it sures seems like most everyone is keeping quiet about Kup’yans’k, at least in the little information bubbles that I frequent. A four-kilometer advance is an enormous claim, especially when coupled with the twenty-some-odd vehicles Ukraine destroyed along the Russian border yesterday.  

 

>Geolocated footage posted on January 21 shows at least 20 new Russian vehicles losses following a recent unsuccessful assault on [Terny](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Terny,+Donetsk+Oblast,+Ukraine,+84440/@49.1096054,37.7959351,9.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x412064d4b350b4bf:0x4b812197302dc90c!8m2!3d49.0919601!4d37.9601291!16s%2Fg%2F121_jrmt?entry=ttu). 

 

These are geolocated losses—confirmed—which makes the Russian activity in the Kup’yans’k direction significant, even if they aren’t backing up their claimed advances with any evidence. And the spread of aggression seems to stretch all the way from [Kup’yans’k](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kup'yans'k,+Kharkiv+Oblast,+Ukraine,+63701/@49.732693,37.585356,10.25z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4120d75c701fc6d7:0xd2d56a3f976d8606!8m2!3d49.7055574!4d37.6027997!16zL20vMGQ1ZDds?entry=ttu) to as far south as [Silversk.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sivers'k,+Donetsk+Oblast,+Ukraine,+84522/@48.9209488,38.0149313,11.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x41200acb0bde2dbb:0x1ba5cbf0a7f471ec!8m2!3d48.873935!4d38.1047909!16zL20vMGd0cXpz?entry=ttu) That wide geographic area, coupled with the (admittedly elevated yet) subdued offensive action across the front, it’s no wonder that the narrative has shifted back to US politics, Ukraine’s Soviet-era artillery munition shortage, and the Kremlin’s big-scary stuffed bear.  

 

To be clear, I still think that Ukraine will launch a major offensive in Kherson Oblast this winter. I’ll likely reevaluate this belief, along with my F-16 hypothesis, if we hit March without seeing evidence of either. Sorry, Carl Sagan, but eventually the absence of evidence becomes the evidence of absence. Maybe its opposite is true in space, but down here on Earth we need to live in the real world, at least when speaking of cabbages and kings.  

 

March 17th, ladies and gentlemen. That’s when you get to laugh at me.  

 

>Ukrainian Southern Operational Command Spokesperson Colonel Nataliya Humenyuk stated that Russian personnel are increasingly refusing to conduct assaults in the Kherson direction because the Russian command prohibits Russian forces from using armored vehicle support during the attacks. 

 

Also still no Russian aviation over Kherson Oblast.  

 

You know, it’s possible that the weak showing of Russia’s offensive could be, at least in part, due to an overall lack of heavy equipment. We’ve seen Russia deploy armor to Krynky, yet despite Ukraine’s continued occupation of this beachhead, Russia is afraid of committing anything more valuable than expendable human lives. Read: brown people.  

 

>Kyrgyzstan issued a statement against Russia’s continued practice of targeting naturalized migrants as part of ongoing crypto-mobilization efforts. 

 

Say it with me now: “Citizenship means nothing if the state can take it away.” <--- If someone is advocating for the opposite in your country, you are morally obligated to kick them in the groin.  

 

>Footage purportedly showing an altercation between a Russian soldier and Chechen “Akhmat-Vostok” forces in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast, reignited criticism of Chechen forces for their lack of contributions to Russian military operations in Ukraine. 

 

[Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1749355643683660181) 

 

It was a curious exchange, as the soldier was clearly attempting to apply policy as proscribed, but the Chechen mercenary was utterly unwilling to comply. Maybe it’s a new policy. Maybe the Chechens are AWOL and Melitipol command is unable to force them to comply. Either way, I have a few questions:  

 

1. Why is a soldier working a checkpoint alone? Where was that kid’s backup?  

2. Why was the first response to a request to comply to procedure to escalate to violence? In a functional military, that should have been worked out back at the station between calm parties, not rise to a physical altercation on a street corner.  

3. Pistol. Out and cocked. That was a man who was prepared to use extreme force, so why was the escalation so radical against supposed friendlies? 

4. Why didn’t the soldier open fire on the man brandishing a firearm in the middle of a direct refusal of a direct order?  

5. Why do all the Chechens have beer bellies? I thought Muslims didn’t drink.  

6. The nullification of all previous ‘permanent’ ongoing orders is rather extreme. Why was this necessary? 

7. Why was a ‘Battalion Commander’ unaware of this change of protocol? And why did he refuse to comply?  

8. Was the ‘Batalion Commander’ a Chechen or Russian MoD commander?  

9. Why was a permanent order written on a piece of printer paper? That does not look legit.  

 

 

 

>An investigation by a Russian opposition outlet suggests that Russian elites may have accepted and internalized the domestic consequences of Russia’s war in Ukraine. 

 

More like, “Realized they can’t do anything about it.” Any “elite” with sense got out of Russia years ago, and just keeps an address and a hired correspondent to deal with local shenanigans. [Mostly they hang out in Dubai.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/us/russian-oligarchs-sanctions-dubai.html) 

 

 

>Russian officials and information space actors are attempting to further rhetorically justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by misrepresenting a decree that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signed on January 22 concerning discrimination against ethnic Ukrainians in Russia. Zelensky’s decree does not establish any territorial demands upon Russia, as select Russian ultranationalists falsely claimed. 

 

 

Honestly I think Zelensky was doing a bit of trolling with this one. He posted a map showing Ukraine’s ethnic borders, which more or less kicked Russia out of the Black Sea.  

 

That said, announcements like this don’t happen in a vacuum. Zelensky didn’t wake up this morning and randomly decide to pull a funny. Rather, this is a negotiation tactic. Ukraine anchored an acceptable peace agreement as dictated by Ukraine. It involves justifiable Russian territorial concessions. So while, yeah, sure, it’s inflated, in a way Zelensky just set terms. This is what Ukraine will take if they completely defeat the Russian army and occupy Moscow. It’s up to the Kremlin to talk them down, because the alternative is this keeps going until Russia collapses. Putin’s choice. Either works for Ukraine.  

 

 

>[Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited Kyiv on January 22 and announced a new Polish defense package for Ukraine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxlRJsQ7p2k) 

 

This one’s a bit weird, as neither side announced the package’s value. I’m going to assume it’s big, but then I’m an optimist. I assume this because the Kremlin recently used EW warfare to cut off Polish GPS, which I doubt went over well with the Poles. 

Either way, for a guy I just learned existed, I like this Donald Tusk fellow. He gets [Storyteller’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZLEvrkbFcQ) “Raddest Dude of the Week” award. It comes with a lifetime supply of imaginary macaroni. Fuck yeah, Poland.

Storyteller here, bringing you today’s most super important headline:  

 

>Russian authorities issued prison sentences in a number of high-profile cases on January 25, including that of imprisoned Russian ultranationalist and former officer Igor Girkin. 

 

Why, Girkin?! Four years behind bars! Four!  Truly he is our generation’s MLK, minus the charisma. Seriously, if he could just be less of a human slug, then maybe the fascists would have a symbol to rally around. But no. Instead, their Furor is a fat incel in his fifties.  

 

Ladies, please, God, go to your local comic bookstore! Just hang out—don't let people like Girkin become real. 

**Save us.** 

 

>Ukrainian and Russian authorities opened criminal investigations into the January 24 Russian Il-76 military transport aircraft crash in Belgorod Oblast. 

 

Oh, are we still on this fucking plane? I’m glad to see there’s common consensus to obey international law. Huzzah. I’m sure that the Kremlin will now allow independent investigators to get to the bottom of the matter. Right? 

 

No? Ah well. Was worth a try.  

 

>The Kremlin is reportedly no longer offering pardons to convict recruits and is significantly changing the terms of their service, likely in response to the reduction of the pool of convicts suitable for recruitment into Russian force generation efforts. 

 

Look, folks, I know it’s a bit of a jolt, but it turns out releasing the incarcerated (now upgraded with PTSD!) carte-blanche back into society with blanket pardons is a bit of a shit idea. Shocker, I know. Luckily Putin came to his senses and decided to cease the mass conscription of prisoners. Right? Right...? 

 

Ah, no I see here now he’s just decided to cease pardoning them. Or releasing them at all, actually. Apparently they’re still prisoners...just on the front line. Forever. As literal cannon fodder. Turns out, Hell is real, and it vacations in our realm under the guise of War. Lucky us.  

 

Looking through what the ISW has outline, I do not see any advantage to serving in the (now) Storm-V units. Prisoners aren’t paid; they aren’t released; they’re still prisoners; and they’re not getting a pardon.  

 

Folks, I’m beginning to think these people are literally slaves.  

 

>Russian forces are reportedly increasing their use of chemical weapons in Ukraine in continued apparent violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is party. 

 

You aren’t hearing about this because the West is practicing a new strategy. We aren’t responding, not publicly. Missiles through NATO sky? “No comment.” GPS downage in Poland? “Don’t recall.” Slicing of Baltic data cable? “Wasn’t worth our time to investigate.” By not rising to the Putin’s taunts, we stifle him in a narrative vacuum. It’s Putin’s initiative, constantly. Every action is because of him. Every taunt is from him. Every comment is from him, and it means we’re constantly exposed to a hideous view of the world, one we wish to change.  

 

Here, though? I think we should say something. Privately, at least. Make Russia understand this sort of thing isn’t okay. That the West will act if this escalates. We definitely have significant room for escalation. Passing a Ukrainian military aid package would be a damn good start, for one thing. A big one.  

 

 

>The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reportedly conducted a successful drone strike on a Rosneft oil refinery in Tuapse, Krasnodar Krai on the night of January 24 to 25.

Y’all notice how these hits on Russian refineries are growing more and more common? They’re widespread, too—geographically speaking. Destruction of this industry is going to cripple the Russian economy to an incalculable level.  

 

The Kremlin’s entire power structure, all of it, rests on its ability to export fossil fuels, and the collapse of that capacity will mean the collapse of Putin’s government. No fossil fuels means no revenue; no revenue means no pensions; and no pensions means no regime. That is the current fundamental conundrum Putin faces. [The moment the pension payments cease to match inflation is the moment the Russian people will take to the streets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_pension_protests)  

 

 

>Bloomberg reported on January 24 that labor shortages in Russia have increased wages in civilian sectors enough to compete with relatively lucrative military salaries, likely making military service even less appealing to Russian citizens. 

 

 

Yeah, Bloomberg, that’s called inflation.  

 

There’s a labor shortage because the Kremlin is scooping up every migrant with a pulse, meaning the wages are high, and shit’s expensive because Ukraine is blowing up the State’s chief source of revenue. Russia doesn’t produce too much stuff, to be honest, so most everything needs to be imported. Putin is slowly coming to realize that he doesn’t have enough people to pull all the levers. Russia isn’t the Soviet Union, and he isn’t Stalin.

Yep, more minor shit. See, the problem with not having an editor is that sometimes things just slip through the cracks.  

Yesterday I mentioned that Eagle Pass was a national park, inadvertently implying that it was some mountainous redoubt. It is not. Eagle Pass is the name of the town, and Shelby Park is a city park within said town. [We’re talking this thing.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shelby+Park/@28.7102845,-100.5122827,15.5z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x865f8dfc76090fc5:0x25d2493414af76d5!8m2!3d28.7079581!4d-100.5091596!16s%2Fg%2F11tn5jd5cn!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu) Yes, this is a city park, a place where most civilized nations keep their ducks, and barbed wire across our side of the shore will mostly impact said ducks as anyone with sense will be taking the two very conveniently placed bridges a klick-or-so to the south. Unless that has barbed wire across it, too. And men with guns. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, that's probably exactly what's happening.

A brief window in my future, I care not how or why I am in such a moment in time, but if you give me the opportunity to nail that piece of shit in the testicles, I will do a good deed.

>A prominent Kremlin-affiliated milblogger attempted to undermine the legitimacy of upcoming US elections.[72] ISW continues to assess that these claims are very likely part of a deliberate Russian information campaign. 

 

I don’t think it’s going to work. Trump’s in full tantrum mode, every indicator is flashing red for the GOP, and Putin’s got some problems back home he should probably focus on instead (more on that later). The information space might feel grim, but I think underneath it all we’re coming together. We saw [protests in Germany against fascism](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/germany-sees-waves-of-protests-against-rise-of-far-right-extremism/article67780364.ece), and people swarming the streets in Slovakia to stand against their far-right government.  

 

[Like look at this thing.](https://apnews.com/article/slovakia-penal-code-protests-robert-fico-7fbd3c9cfb4f97298f00a0fca01c3e15) Those people fill the streets.  

 

No, I think the Kremlin’s attempts to stir shit up is going to fall on very deaf ears this election cycle. I think we’re about to see a surprising coalescence of support around Nikki Haley. There are terrifying parallels between Putin and Trump, and I think many moderate, run of the mill conservatives want someone...you know, conservative. Not a second bite of a shit-filled twinkie.  

 

 

>Russian authorities are likely blocking communications in the Sakha Republic for the fourth consecutive day following January 24 protests in support of a Russian citizen allegedly murdered by a naturalized Russian citizen from Tajikistan. 

 

Four days now of straight protests despite certainly stiff resistance--and, after four days, an escalating response. <--- that’s the key. It means the situation is deteriorating. And Putin didn’t institute a blackout for the Bashkortostan Riots. Whatever is happening in [Sakha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakha_Republic) is for serious.  

Obviously, thanks to the Kremlin, we can’t know what’s happening in the far depths of Siberia, but we can speculate. I have looked into the bones and do you know what I saw? Godzilla. He has risen from the deep. This is not a riot, this is nature punishing man for his hubris.  

 

 

>UK outlet the Telegraph reported on January 26, citing an unnamed Western official, that Russia is spending roughly 40 percent of its GDP on the war in Ukraine, more than Russian national spending on health and education.

Still, 40% GDP on the war doesn’t leave much for the common person. Not after the oligarchs get their share. It’s no wonder there’s riots popping up all over the place. The question I guess now is...where does Putin go from here? How does he bring more to bear? There ain't much gas left in the tank.

Folks, I don’t want to alarm anyone, but I think we need to recognize that we are drifting perilously close to a Third World War. Between the election meddling, random acts of clandestine sabotage, and ever-escalating threats, we need to put aside our disbelief and recognize that we are under attack.  

We are experiencing the slow onset of war. Bit by bit, our options shrink. Putin is stealing our peace, and he’s getting away with it because we are too afraid to fight. I want the MAGA rat-fuckers in the House to recognize that three Americans died today because their selfish cowardice. If we had stood our ground earlier, those people might still be alive. 


If you haven’t already, [dive into Maus.](https://archive.org/details/maus-a-survivors-tale-my-father-bleeds-history-by-art-spiegelman/mode/2up) It’s the most important comic book you will ever read.  

 

>The Kremlin also continues to frame and justify a long-term Russian war effort as part of an existential geopolitical confrontation with the West and Nazism. 

 

Maus is unique in that it doesn’t deal with the German’s perspective, not one bit. It’s not the Americans, nor the French, nor the British. It follows a Pole—specifically a Jewish one. The central theme is one of relentless partitioning. Pieces are sliced off: a gold watch for a fancy paper, a neighbor for a loaf of bread, grandparents for one more month in the ghetto. The Nazis took everything bit by bit. It’s a hard novel to read, but critical in understanding the threat we face.  

 

>Kremlin officials and mouthpieces continue to set information conditions to destabilize Moldova, likely as part of efforts to prevent Moldova’s integration into the EU and the West among other objectives. 

 

Yeah, why not? Just keep slicin, Putin. Fuckin’ see where it gets you.  

 

What I don’t understand is why he’s choosing to do this now. Moldova is all the way on the other side of Ukraine, and instigating more tension is the opposite of what he should be doing. I thought the end game was to wait until the West lost interest? What happened to that plan?  

 

 

>The Kremlin will likely use the withdrawals of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to continue efforts to expand Russian influence in Francophone Africa. 

 

Huh...It seems like a sizeable portion of Central Africa is pulling away from France and drifting towards the Kremlin. Most of these ""countries” are run by warlords masquerading as presidents, so I doubt they’re manifesting the will of the People with these decisions.  

 

 

>Unnamed Indian government sources stated that India wants to distance itself from Russia, its largest arms supplier, because the war in Ukraine has limited Russia’s ability to provide India with munitions. 

 

Oh! Drama!  

 

India has long had a love affair with Russian military equipment. The crap’s cheap, rugged, and gets the job done. Need a tank? Boom. T-72. Truck? Here’s a Ural. SAM cause American sky things are expensive? A slightly used S-300, or better yet, [an as-yet-to-be-delivered S-400!](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/russia-cannot-meet-arms-delivery-commitments-because-war-indian-air-force-says-2023-03-23/)  

 

That S-400 is actually a bit of a sticking point, as many of the high-end systems India’s been ordering from Russia are slow to arrive. Naturally India’s getting a little heated; first, because they likely paid for it already, and second because the world seems to be very rapidly spiraling into chaos.  

 

Weeeeeee.   

 

Of course, to India I would like to remind them that they were shopping at the arms-dealer equivalent of a Dollar General. It is not worth it to go complaining to the manager, because even if you win, you’re still arguing over coupons in a Dollar General.

Rumor has it that Russia will soon attempt a rotation in Kherson Oblast. That would be remarkable as it would be the first time throughout the entirety of the war that the Kremlin has tried something so...gracious. Good on them.  

 

I’m willing to be halfway through the rotation will be point at which they are the most vulnerable, as existing troops will be eager to get out, and incoming troops will be disoriented. Just saying.

>The Iranian regime falsely claimed that Iran had no role in the January 28 one-way drone attack that killed three US servicemembers in northeastern Jordan.  

 

I kept my comments yesterday minimal because the information was still pouring in. It’s been about a day and now we know a lot more.  

First, we figured out how Iran pulled off their little trick, and I gots to give ‘em credit, it was damn clever. Iran’s proxies shadowed an American drone on its way back to base, meaning our SAM systems detected one target instead of two. Now that we know how they did it, however, we can make certain we never fall for the same gimmick twice. That’ll be up to the US DoD to figure out.  

Second, Western media actually did its fucking job and reported Iran as the responsible party, which is important because social media today was disgusting. The bots, the justifications, the excuses, the what-aboutisms--they were all over the place and the sight made me sick. When everything’s stabilized and makes sense again, we need to come together as a species and hash out some rules regarding information war. Democracy can’t exist in this environment.  

And third, I think [Beau had the best take.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjE6HIExUX0) He’s right in that the solution is decapacitation, but I think he underplays the importance of immediate reprisal. Every second that passes lengthens the distance between the event and our response. The longer that time period stretches, the more tenuous the connection, and it isn’t Iran we need to dissuade; it’s everyone else.  

Yeah, eventually the US will slam a missile into some IRGC command center or something, but if it doesn’t happen in the next week or so then what will message will that send to the Houthis? To Hezbollah? To the African juntas? Iran *will* understand, that much is guaranteed, but we also need to make our response unambiguous lest we allow the stupid and brutal to draw the wrong conclusions. It’s not the nation states that I’m concerned about—it's the war lords. The more confident they feel, the more brush fires they’ll start, and the more likely this conflagration will smolder out of control.  

Escalate to deescalate. It’s a well-worn doctrine.  

In my opinion Biden needs to nut-up and do his fuckin’ job. I don’t want to be in the Middle East either, but unless we want to reexperience the geopolitical shitshow that was the Afghani withdrawal, we need to ensure any future movements happen on *our* terms. That means reminding everyone **now** that the US President is the only one who decides where our military finds itself.  

Blow up the Shahed manufacturing facilities. Do it at night to avoid civilians. Announce the attack beforehand—what the fuck is Iran going to do? Stop us? Please.

ISW’s been half-assing their reports lately and it’s pissing me off. How am I supposed to keep people interested in the Russo-Ukraine War if they give me nothing to work with? Stingy bastards.  

 

>The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense (MoD) denied rumors about the purported resignation or dismissal of Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi on January 29. 

 

 

This is it, huh? This is my headline? A rumor wrapped in a Kremlin psy-op? I need another drink.  

 

To begin, Ukraine says this whole story is bullshit, and considering the story hinges upon a decision by Ukraine, I’m inclined to believe them. Removing Zaluzhnyi would mean a drastic change in Ukraine’s plan for the future of the war, which does not seem at all likely. Zaluzhnyi is a defensive minded general and any replacement would mean installation of one who’s suicidally aggressive, which isn’t what this war demands. It’d be like installing Colonel Custer as overall entente command halfway through World War One.  

 

We have this rumor thanks to a Ukrainian People’s Deputy [Oleksii Honcharenko,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksiy_Goncharenko) essentially a mid-tier politician. Ukraine has about 450 of them, and when you’ve got 450 of anything, one or two of that number is bound to broken or bonkers. And, quite frankly, I don’t see why Honcharenko would know this information. He seems primarily wrapped up in immigration. Nothing in his Wikipedia screams “Defense Circles!” 

 

Now the Kremlin is amplifying this rumor because for months now they’ve attempted to sow discord between Zelenskyy and Zaluzhnyi. This story plays right into their little gimmick. “Oh! Secret firing! But why?!!!” That’s what they want everyone to be asking themselves. The Kremlin wants as little attention paid to their problems as possible (I see that information blackout, mother fuckers.)  

 

Until Kyiv announces something officially, it’s not real.  

 

 

>Russia may be retooling aspects of its air defense umbrella in deep rear areas amid continued Ukrainian drone strikes within Russia. 

 

How deep are we talking here? The Kremlin released footage of a successful downing of a Ukrainian drone today on its way to one of their refineries. They made a big hullabaloo about it, which...great? Just as planned? Because if the Kremlin has covered their fossil fuel refineries in AA, then that means they’re going to have a hard time keeping SAM coverage coherent throughout Ukraine.  Exertion of strength in one place always means weakness somewhere else.  

 

>Russia appears to be fueling and seizing on neo-imperialist and nationalist sentiments in Europe in order to drive wedges between Ukraine and its western neighbors. 

 

That’s where all these weird partitioning stories that keep popping up stem from. Romania apparently wants Odessa or something, and Hungary gets West Ukraine—it’s essentially Putin promising portions of Ukraine to nationalists to encourage their buy-in and support. And considering the prerequisite to become a neonationalist is a stunted sense of empathy, these people are slobbering all over Putin’s offer.  

 

Putin’s making a mistake, though. The scarier he makes himself, the closer we draw together. The Free World isn’t like the Russian people, we aren’t beaten down and hopeless...because we know we can do better. The West holds itself to an impossible standard, not because we think we can obtain it, but because we know we must try. The conversations we have now, on this website, are only unique in medium. The substance? I guarantee that’s unchanged.  

 

They say history repeats, and I’d say I agree. Every generation there is a tyrant. Every generation there are those who would rather cower and hide, deny and exploit. And every generation we must remind ourselves why we cherish Liberty, lest we forget her value. 

 

 

>Russian and Ukrainian sources continued to disagree over the status of Tabaivka (southeast of Kupyansk) on January 29. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that elements of the Russian Western Grouping of Forces captured Tabaivka, and many Russian milbloggers amplified this claim.[25] ISW has not yet observed visual confirmation of the purported Russian capture of Tabaivka,

Woopie. Then there’s another behind that, and another behind that, and another behind that...all the way to Kyiv.

The thing is, though, I’m not seeing huge gains. The front remains stagnant, just as stagnant as it was (and is) in Avdiivka. In launching...whatever this is, Putin’s spending what’s left in the treasury. There’s nowhere else to escalate from here, resource wise. 40% of GDP: [that’s the number I saw floating around.](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/27268#:~:text=UK%20outlet%20the%20Telegraph%20reported,with%20occupied%20areas%20of%20Ukraine.) Almost half. 

And yet still payin’ out pensions, eh, Putin? “Oh, I bribe the Muscovites to stay passive and asleep. This is great! Better start a war.” Fuckin’ dumbass. 

 

Anyway, Russia is pressing hard into Kupyansk, and, in some places, making marginal gains. Like we’re talking one-or-two hamlets. It’s adorable, considering the weight Putin’s attempting to bring to bear.

 Kremlin’s dropping this shit from Belgorod to Zaporizhya, five times in the last couple days. Extensive usage of chemical weapons would be...beyond barbaric, and this isn't even close to the worst the Kremlin's got in its stockpile. 

They should feel ashamed of themselves. We left this chapter behind. Every country signed the Chemical Weapons Convention for a damn reason—[even Hitler didn’t use these things (on soldiers).](https://www.history.com/news/the-nazis-developed-sarin-gas-but-hitler-was-afraid-to-use-it) And it's easy to see why he was so terrified, as [Hitler lost a testicle in the First World War](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0U20KI/). Such a trauma... it changes a man. The thought of chemical weapons likely triggered all sorts of PTSD flashbacks.  

 

>Senior Russian officials may be intensifying their attempts to frame and justify Russia’s long term war effort in Ukraine as an existential geopolitical confrontation with the West by explicitly equating the US with the Nazis. 

 

*Yawn*.  

 

>Russian opposition sources suggested that widespread internet outages in Russia on January 30 may be the result of Russian efforts to establish the “sovereign internet” system. 

 

The Kremlin didn’t just decide to flick the internet off on a whim. They changed their DNS information, meaning the downtime was likely how long it took for the change to populate.  

 

Either way, this is probably the most significant story in the ISW’s entire article, because it means the Russian internet now flows through a Kremlin controlled DNS server. Putin looked at the modem, he looked at the firewall, and spread his cheeks wide to human centipede himself between the two. Wonderful.  

 

This will grant the Kremlin absolute control over public discourse. The power behind this sort of thing cannot be overstated. By deciding who is allowed to connect to “the internet” Putin is deciding whether someone exists. Entire regions can find themselves cutoff from the outside world with a keystroke. VPNs become useless, as all outside communication must route through the Kremlin’s DNS server. They catch dissidents before they even get out the door. With this one change, the Kremlin has seized absolute control over Russian communications.  

 
You guys remember all those videos of Muscovites complaining about their burst pipes? Yeah, that sort of thing is about to become super uncommon—not because it isn’t happening, rather we just won’t hear about it.  

 

>The Kremlin has been intensifying efforts to consolidate control over the Russian information space in advance of the March 2024 Russian presidential election, and these efforts support the development of the “sovereign internet” system. 

 

Well he’s got it now. This Presidential election is going to go smoothly whether it wants to or not, apparently.

This one’s more of some personal accountability. Yesterday I mentioned Putin had probably begun to enforce the Kremlin as Russia’s defacto DNS provider, hence the shutdown. My phrasing grossly oversimplified the process to the point of being functionally incorrect. I use that word ‘functionally’ because I believe the ‘form’ is the same, that being Putin’s absolute control over the Russian people’s communications.

>Ukrainian forces struck Russian targets in the vicinity of Belbek airfield in occupied Sevastopol, Crimea on January 31. 

 

Hahahahaha, oh Lord. Yeah, so, at this rate I don’t think Russia’s going to have much of an air force come spring. No damage has been confirmed, but I’ve seen rumors that Ukraine nabbed upwards of three SU-34s in this attack. It’s a smack upside the head, that’s for certain. And it follows in Ukraine’s overarching effort to “pave the way” for the F-16s. However that whole thing shakes out.

 

Russia claimed Ukraine fired off upwards of twenty missiles. They also claimed they were ‘storm shadow’ whatever the fuck that means. Storm shadows are expensive, and I doubt Ukraine would fire off twenty of the things for three jets. Sure, it’s 1 : 3 on cost, but that’s still not a favorable exchange in Ukraine’s favor. Not when one of those missiles could just as easily pull of a 1 : ‘A LOT’ on  

 

So either the Kremlin is lying about the number (maybe), or the Kremlin is lying about the weapon (likely). And if it wasn’t Storm Shadows, and if it wasn’t drones, then what the fuck was it? Honestly it could be anything. [Just fucking anything.](https://www.newsweek.com/nato-ally-responds-rumors-secret-f16-combat-mission-ukraine-russia-romania-1865153) 

 

 

 

>Ukrainian and Russian forces conducted a prisoner-of-war (POW) exchange on January 31, exchanging 195 Russian POWs for 207 Ukrainian POWs. 

 

This hostage exchange was preplanned, meaning none of the hostages exchanged were on the manifest from the Il-76, so still no resolution on that front.  

 

 

 

>The European Union (EU) will reportedly fall short of its promise to provide Ukraine with one million artillery shells by March 1, 2024, as European leaders call on EU member states to intensify deliveries of ammunition to Ukraine. 

 

600k is still pretty good. Could be better, though. That’s why a goal’s a goal. Let’s step it up, yeah?  

 

Especially since,  

 

>A Ukrainian commander operating in the Kupyansk direction stated that Russian forces’ main objective in the area was the capture of Kupyansk-Vuzlovy (immediately east of Kupyansk) and Kupyansk and that the capture of Synkivka would provide the quickest route for Russian forces to advance to these settlements. 

 

This looks to be kicking into high gear. We’re seeing Russian aggression across the entire front, from Kupyansk to Krynky, and in an almost desperate, swarm-like mentality. Looks like Putin’s biting at that ‘West is weak!’ narrative that’s been dangling above our heads these last few weeks. He’s got his mouth around it. Let’s hope its center is a hook.  

 

 

>Estonian Defense Forces Commander General Martin Herem stated that Russia may be behind recent GPS jamming in the Baltic region. 

 

Russian Federation is apparently testing something and are using Europe’s GPS network as a testbed for their experiments. It’s perhaps the loudest secret project I’ve ever seen developed, but I will admit that it’s a secret project. Also a pain in the ass and technically an act of war. Schultz should give Ukraine a few Taurus missiles as a warning to Russia. That’d be real cool of them.

Howdy Folks,  

 

Let’s get to it.  

 

>[Ukrainian forces successfully struck and sunk a Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF) vessel in the Black Sea near occupied Crimea on the night of January 31 to February 1.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5zGkqAWsWE) 

 

Holy fucking shit where the hell did that come from?!  

 

But it makes sense, right? If South Crimea is strikable, why [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ozero+Donuzlav/@45.6086241,32.5696119,8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x40c04077f8a92471:0x6997fb5b7dfb88e3!8m2!3d45.3583333!4d33.0383333!16s%2Fm%2F0_xc597?entry=ttu) too?  

 

What the fuck was the Kremlin thinking leaving such an expensive piece of military hardware on the west coast of Crimea? Was this supposed to support assaults on Krynky? They have to be insane. With this strike, Ukraine just demonstrated they have the entire western half of the peninsula under fire control. Like sure, they’re probably munition limited, but then it just becomes a question of optimizing target value.

 

So what did the Kremlin lose? Well, a boat. An expensive boat. It’s forty-man missile corvette, meaning it was one of the things shooting missiles at Ukrainian hospitals. It was also one of the last significant threats towards Black Sea shipping. Its loss will likely bring insurance premiums down for Ukrainian grain exports. Odessa might actually make a profit this year!  

 

Russia says Ukraine shot a dozen Storm Shadows to take the boat down. Crimean air defense claimed they knocked down all of them...? All of them but one, apparently.  

 

>The milblogger claimed that Russian forces downed five missiles near Belbek Air Base in occupied Sevastopol and six missiles over Yana Kapu, Hvardiske, and northwest of Sevastopol and that one missile struck the ground near Belbek Air Base but did not damage it. 

 

Look, I don’t want to tell the Kremlin how to do its job, but why are missiles fired at a boat in a harbor on the northwest overflying [Belbek Air Base?](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Belbek+Air+Base/@44.9545055,33.1662959,9z?entry=ttu)  

 

Striking both the corvette and the air base would be ballsy play, not one I would expect Ukraine to use with its limited Storm Shadow supply. They’ve only got [forty](https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2024/01/17/france-to-give-ukraine-more-cruise-missiles-plans-security-pact/) of these things, and if what the Kremlin is saying is true (it isn’t), then over the last two days Ukraine has launched thirty-two of them. There are...many contradictions in the Kremlin’s story, but if I’m inclined to humor them then I would pay attention to the numbers. Notice they didn’t say drones. The milblogger claimed missiles.  

 

So how the hell is Ukraine firing off twelve storm shadow missile salvos? Jury-rigged Su-34s carry one, max two, at a time, meaning Ukraine would have to field minimum a wing of six to meet the numbers this milblogger is claiming. F-16s don’t carry them, by the way. So that’s out, assuming they’re not some generic-ass air-to-surface missile the Kremlin is confusing for Storm Shadows.  

 

Which leaves [GLSDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_Launched_Small_Diameter_Bomb), as /u/Franknarf mentioned [yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNuttySpectacle/comments/1ag3vyp/the_peanut_gallery_january_31_2024/koeki6t/) These puppies are typically fired from a [Himars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLhoDB-ORLQ) launcher with a 150 km range—key word being ‘typically’. It’s a pain in the ass, but technically they can be fired from the ammunition pod itself. This means it can be shipped, moved as it were. My thought is Ukraine fired these sons of bitches off from their [oil rigs around Odessa.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Ukrainian_gas_drilling_platforms_in_Black_sea.jpg)  

 

Sure, it still doesn’t explain how the missiles made it to Belbek, but it’s a damn sight better than the hogwash the Kremlin is trying to sell.  

 

>Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi presented an overarching strategy to seize the theater-wide initiative in Ukraine and retain it to facilitate Ukrainian battlefield victories despite Russia’s numerical advantages in manpower and materiel. Zaluzhnyi’s strategy aims to offset Ukraine’s existing challenges and pursue advantages over the Russian military through widespread technological innovation and adaptation. 

 

I haven’t read it (will soon), but the ISW’s assessment seems to imply that the main problem is a lack of speed. It’s literally the same conundrum we had in World War One: the tank (horse) is too fragile to survive, and the infantry are too slow to exploit a breach. What do?  

 

Again, I haven’t read it, but let me spit ball an idea: Gunships. These drones are getting big now, and honestly, it’s about time we try strapping a gatling gun to one of them. Why go through the whole rigmarole of dropping a grenade when you could instead point and shoot? Sure, recoil would be a bitch, but fear not, boys and girls. Uncle Sam has a [rifle for every occasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoilless_rifle).  

 

The basic strat is: suicide drones swoop in for armor, gunships mop up infantry, and then the Ukrainians show up. Mostly as a formality, and ideally carried in palanquins by robots. Women...shall be brought to them.  

 

 

>Russian milbloggers continued to voice frustrations about Russian forces’ continued tactical blunders during offensive operations in western Donetsk Oblast. 

 

Kupyansk ain’t goin’ nowhere, mother fucker. That offensive was D.O.A.  

 

Still ongoing, however. Making slight gains, so it is *way* too soon to call it, but you know what? I’m feeling lucky. I have seen zero indication the Kremlin can improve their offensive capacity. I’m watching the same columns of olive-green tanks blowing up that I was watching a year and change ago. The tactics are damn near identical.  

 

Which is exactly why the milblogger is bitching. Ukrainian mines forced Russian armor into thin columns, making them easy targets for pre-sighted artillery. The Ukrainians took the lessons they learned at the Surovikhin Line and duplicated them in Kupyansk. If Ukraine, with all of its NATO intel and toys, couldn’t breach it, why would the incompetent and beleaguered Russian Federation have a prayer?

>EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Joseph Borrell stated that the European Union (EU) will not be able to send the promised one million shells to Ukraine by March 2024, but is planning to fulfill this promise by the end of 2024. 

 

More evidence of manufacturing as the primary bottleneck for aid. 

 

 

>The European Union (EU) unanimously approved a financial support package for Ukraine for 2024 ­­– 2027. 

 

 

And closing tonight we have the highlight of my day. Good job, Europe. $54 billion is an enormous contribution, plus the EU demonstrated it can overrule a veto. That’s an important first step in reigning in such a misplaced democratization of power. Oh, and even better was seeing Victor Orban humiliated. That fat bastard needed to be reminded of his place.  

 

Now it’s our turn here in the States. Last I heard the two bills, Ukraine and border, were about to be separated...and I legitimately have no idea if that’s good news. DC is opaque atm.

As a rule, I try not to hold to formal rules. I’m a Taoist, so rigid structure? That ain’t for me. Like a river, I typically follow a predictable path, a groove I carve into the land, but over time the banks erode, the course subtly shifts. Yes, the destination is always the same, but the river? She is always new.  

That is the essence of the Tao. Maybe. Probably not, actually. By calling it the Tao I make it not the Tao.  

The point is sometimes a name is going to appear above your head. I attempt to acknowledge each of them, sometimes I’ll forget, and frequently it will take me several days to get around to it. Deep down in my core is a student putting off doing his homework.  

Like for example, just forty years ago I got toasted in a hookah lounge in Jericho, right? Just stumbling out into the night absolutely shit-faced. I *should* have been back home to study for a chem exam...but fuck that noise. Now the Quran frowns on the matter of alcohol, but it is still very easy to find. Especially in hookah bars. Prohibition has never worked, neither federal nor divine. And when you mix the two? Bliss. I assume. I never could suffer tobacco. ..now what they sold under the table on the other hand...

That’s when I saw her: the most beautiful woman I have ever met. True, she was a bit hairy, and her horns were super pointy, but there was something about her cloven hooves, the sideways shift of her jaw as she chewed a mouthful of hay. It was mesmerizing. She was my Madonna, and I stumbled after her...but she was a nervous one and fled into the desert. And so I chased my nymph, my muse, my flighty infatuation, for what else is a man to do?  

Jericho is not the most hospitable place, and it’s doubly so when you’re plastered. I soon got lost and come morning I still couldn’t find my way home. So I set to walking, and I’ll tell you I must have been marching through that desert for a *long-ass time* before, up ahead, through the haze and the heat, I saw Her. My Jezebel. The traitor who left me to my fate.  

And yet...still I yearned for my love. I longed to feel her touch, the caress of her warm and insistent tongue. I swept her in my arms, but before we could become one, I heard a horn: a triumphant declaration from over the horizon to welcome the dawn. I looked and there I saw the city, and a puff of smoke...a puff which heralded the spinning form of /u/yaki_kaki cartwheeling through the sky. They slammed into the sand, smoldered for a bit, and took in the scene. Eventually they raised a single finger and stated, “That’s a goat.”  

Anyway that’s the story of how /u/yaki_kaki stopped me from making a horrible mistake. In recognition of their deed, I award them the ‘Joshua’s Clarion Call’ flair. May they wear it with pride.  

Don’t do ayahuasca, kids. You’ll fail your chem tests.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin evoked a wide Russian social and economic mobilization reminiscent of the Soviet Union’s total mobilization during the Second World War during a February 2 speech despite the fact that Russia is undertaking a far more gradual but nonetheless effective mobilization of its defense industrial base (DIB). 

 

 

The thing is, even the ISW recognizes that Russia doesn’t have anywhere left to go, industrially speaking. Their economy is suffering critical labor shortages, and the front is chewing through migrants at an alarming pace. Forty percent of the RF GDP is going into the war effort. Is that not mobilization? Seems like it to me.  

 

Putin’s problem is that he’s a cartel masquerading as a government. He is chief oligarch among many oligarchs, all of whom get their wealth from appointments granted to them by Putin. Each, in one way or another, owe their position, their very livelihood, to Putin, intrinsically tying their lifestyle to his success. It means that if it doesn’t give Putin a cut, then it doesn’t exist, and more and more lately that’s just been the oil sector. Minimum pensions keep the Muscovites calm, and everyone else kind of just fends for themselves. Maybe the government sometimes does something. Maybe.  

 

The point is, if industry is suffering labor shortages, and the front chews people, and if another mobilization will only exacerbate this dichotomy, what the hell else can Putin mobilize? Five? Ten more percent of GDP? Woopie! Anything more than that and austerity will begin to kick in, likely corresponding with a reduction in pensions.  

 

 

>Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stated on February 2 that Russian forces retain the “strategic initiative” along the entire frontline in Ukraine, a notable departure from Shoigu’s previous characterization of Russian operations as “active defense.” 

 

 

Yep. And the tone has changed as well. Russia is trying to sound triumphant, which I imagine plays no small part into the impending presidential elections. It’s such a shame they don’t have any victories to show for this initiative, especially for the strength the Kremlin has committed,  

 

 

>Ukrainian Eastern Group of Forces Spokesperson Captain Ilya Yevlash stated that Russian forces have concentrated 40,000 personnel, 500 tanks, 650 infantry fighting vehicles, 430 artillery systems, and over 150 MLRS systems in the Kupyansk direction, and that there is a total of 57,000 Russian personnel in both the Kupyansk and Lyman directions. Ukrainian officials and sources reported that Russian forces had concentrated roughly 100,000 personnel in the Kupyansk and Lyman directions as of October 2023. Yevlash may have been referring to a geographically smaller sector of the frontline area than the other Ukrainian sources. 

 

Here’s a thought, ISW: what if she’s referring to the same sector of the frontline? What if Ukraine has killed 43, 000 Russians since October? What if she’s telling us there are only 17k Russians in the Lyman direction because the Kremlin’s concentrated everything they’ve got in Kupyansk? What if they’re having trouble replacing their losses? Maybe due to all the riots out east?  

 

The world may never know.  

 

Still, that’s a lot of crap. Good luck to Ukraine in the coming weeks.  

 

 

>Open-source investigations indicate that Russian forces are benefitting from Ukraine’s ammunition shortage and inability to conduct sufficient counterbattery warfare. 

 

Ukrainian ammunition shortages appear to be enabling the Russians. They’re concentrating artillery again, like in Bakhmut, smashing towns to smithereens before their advance. Drones are effective close, but they often can’t travel 25 kms to the artillery in the back line. To do that, Ukraine needs effective volume of fire to chase off any guns that get too close. They can’t do that with what they’ve got, at least in the Kupyansk direction.  

 

 

>Russian outlet Izvestiya stated on February 2, citing sources within the Russian military, that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) is forming air defense units as part of assault units to defend Russian infantry against Ukrainian drones, frontline air strikes, and shelling. 

 

 

 

Wait...air defense units as part of assault units? The guys that storm the trenches? The rat food? What.  

The example this outlet gave was driving a SAM platform right up to the front line to protect against drones...which was somehow supposed to accomplish something. To be honest I think this is just an excuse to force VKS troops without an AA gun to grab a rifle and man a trench. It’s not like S-400s are just rolling off the factory line, and Ukraine (supposedly) lacks an airforce, so what are these people even doing?  

 

Nobody dare tell Putin this is a terrible idea. Because it’s not. It’s a great idea. Sending skilled SAM operators on pointless assaults prior to the arrival of F-16s is just the sort of ‘can do!’ attitutde that got Putin where he is today.

">During the modern war in Afghanistan the US spent most of its resources building infrastructure, schools, and training/arming the Afghan army. Sounds like you don't know what you're talking about.

Opium farming in Marjah was never in the Afghan national interest, all it did was feed warlordism. China helped them build more schools in the past 3 years than the US did the entire time it was there. And training and arming the Afghan army was a complete waste of time and effort, something US skeptics were railing about for over a decade.

I see a lot of wishful thinking by people who want China to ""get their turn"" in some quixotic/punitive war in Afghanistan, but there is really no evidence that the Taliban regime is interested in fighting China, and plenty of evidence that they see it as a [priority partnership](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/14/is-chinas-recognition-of-afghanistan-envoy-a-diplomatic-win-for-taliban).",r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdE85Nks5V0RwU0dfZTkyNF9MY2E3MjFuNXVXNHNfWTlEMjRXS2ZFbzhIS09FSExVc1FOZDJVUDc2UkE3Z3pnQ3NUZDdvZTJoYXZHWDBZZnIwQWl3dFE9PQ==

Their issue is one of national sovereignty under Islamist governance. China has no real interest in political influence over Afghanistan. Since the start we've been talking about diplomatic and economic ties, which are mostly agnostic to other considerations. 

You started off with an absurdity about US-built infrastructure in Afghanistan and mentioned opium cultivation. My point was that the US mission was control over Afghanistan, and such initiatives were aimed at promoting anti-Taliban forces. 

China is dealing with Taliban-run Afghanistan on its own terms.

"Cool. Though, I'm not confident about the actual meaning behind much of this. Prior to Sweden's accession, Sweden was already a Western country with strong ties and leanings to the U.S.

And, although this is definitely debatable and I'm open-minded to being wrong, I feel that there is not much difference between an 'ally' and a subordinate country. The U.S. probably has more influence over Ecuador than over Brazil, and so in a time of need, Ecuador would be a better go-to. This is the same with Georgia and Turkiye; the U.S. has more influential capacity over Georgia than Turkiye, so even though Turkiye is considered an ally here, Georgia would be more preferable to rely on to act in the U.S.' favor. Pragmatically, then, where is the meaning behind defining allies like this? Useful data would weigh subordinate countries as more U.S.-leaning than allies. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan work with and agree with the U.S. much more than Brazil or Bulgaria do.",r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTZmwzN0g2T3EzVjFobG9ZU3cwSVcxdFdGVFN5NTFPS1M4aHhJaHBlZmQ2OVpIMWNwNlF2bktxTm0yMUhaSUdRbF94TW5nS0xSRmRWZThDenB1bnl1VUE9PQ==
">I'm not confident about the actual meaning behind much of this.

It actually does have a lot of significance in U.S. foreign relations. ""Ally"" isn't about who's reliable or who the U.S. has influence over. Per DOD's website: ""Alliances are formal agreements between two or more nations. In national defense, they're promises that each nation will support the other, particularly during war...Treaties are the documents that seal the deal on alliances, so sometimes you might hear the term 'treaty ally.'""

As for the term ""Major Non-NATO ally"", from the State Department: ""Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status is a designation under U.S. law that provides foreign partners with certain benefits in the areas of defense trade and security cooperation.""

[https://www.state.gov/major-non-nato-ally-status/](https://www.state.gov/major-non-nato-ally-status/) 

""Ally"" doesn't necessarily suggest 100% reliability or 100% alignment on every single issue - easy example is the sheer number of countries (including many traditional U.S. allies like Japan, France, etc.) who have voted in the UN for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, while the U.S. votes against it.

You could argue there should be a separate category for countries that the U.S. can rely on much more, the U.S. can influence more easily, etc. But there's no official term or designation for that right now - in either U.S. legislation or U.S. foreign policy.

"I don't think any rational despot around the world would look at this war and see it as a sales pitch for unjust invasion of your neighbors. 

Russia clearly expected to roll into Kiev after a few months and be done by Christmas '22. 2 years later they suffered a major and humiliating stalemate. 

Will it last? Probably not - it seems that Russia has resigned to the long war and has the resources to pick at their eastern borders until victory by Christmas 2070. 

I can't imagine there is a single leader in the world who had machinations for their neighbors territory who hasn't looked at this conflict and reevaluated all of their assumptions. 

Nobody with perceived weaker neighbors wants to be in Russia's shoes right now. 

With that said - what can we expect from a peace deal? Not a lot probably - other than a lot of lives saved in a perpetually frozen conflict and a demarcated Eastern Ukraine. Whether or not we like it - the world's powers have conspired to push us into a 2nd Cold War, so that paradigm is here, no avoiding it now. Perhaps at this point a frozen conflict would be work in our favor by allowing us to fully integrate the remains of Ukraine into the western sphere and turn it into a West Berlin style cultural hub that can exert great influence into Russia. You can bet Luhansk and Donetsk won't be exhibiting the same economic boom Kiev would. 

Some believe that Russia's victory may be inevitable, what I've describe above would be a damn sight more appealing than a total loss for Ukraine, and may actually hurt Russia in the long run more. 

What did they actually get out of this war? A warm water port in a perpetually economically starved Crimea. Luhansk and Donetsk aren't exactly cultural crown jewels of western Russia.

"**Note: you can scroll down a bit for an audio version of this article**

This report is extremely revealing about how Israel has gone about displacing and harming Palestinians in the West Bank by supporting, abetting, and providing cover for settler violence.

Israel's ethnic cleansing and illegal settlement expansion in the West Bank are perhaps the biggest flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. So many destructive decisions and beliefs can be tied to it. For example, Israeli leadership's shunning of a peace deal and two-state solution since the status quo leaves it in power and free to expand settlements. Settlements are so important because they will be extremely hard to uproot in any potential peace deal, meaning Israel is tightening its grip on this illegally settled land.

This section really stood out to me:

>Sharon announced what he called Israel’s “disengagement” from Gaza, with a plan to remove settlers — forcibly if necessary — over the next two years. The motivations were complex and the subject of considerable debate. For Sharon, at least, it appeared to be a tactical move. “The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process,” his senior adviser Dov Weisglass told Haaretz at the time. “And when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.”

This shows that even with supposedly peace-seeking actions like removing settlers from Gaza, Israeli leadership sought to cripple the two-state solution. Israel's continued violence and humiliating occupation and subjugation of Palestinians (as detailed ad nauseum in this report) has been the fuel that lifted up groups like Hamas and pushed Palestinians to seek violent means of resistance. In their view, Israel hasn't been a willing and open partner for peace. I strongly recommend that you read this extremely well-reported article.",r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjYm5HbURkZVZVZUppS2VsNDJtRXIyYnlqOEcxVjBmdjBXNU5GSkNqeFRuWnlQbzZQSUR2aUEtaTFaSy0ycmtSNWlmUFZXTUdrRE5pUU53c2xlTkJ6amc9PQ==

>* Several sources described how the ability to shoot without restrictions gave soldiers a way to blow off steam or relieve the dullness of their daily routine. “People want to experience the event [fully],” S., a reservist who served in northern Gaza, recalled.

>* ""We’re here for the hostages, but it is clear that the war harms the hostages. That was my thought then; today it turned out to be true.”

>* The six sources — all except one of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity — recounted how Israeli soldiers routinely executed Palestinian civilians simply because they entered an area that the military defined as a “no-go zone.” The testimonies paint a picture of a landscape littered with civilian corpses, which are left to rot or be eaten by stray animals; the army only hides them from view ahead of the arrival of international aid convoys, so that “images of people in advanced stages of decay don’t come out.” Two of the soldiers also testified to a systematic policy of setting Palestinian homes on fire after occupying them.",r/foreignpolicyanalysis,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNQWDlWMUEwRmt6ZU9xdUNibTBpVmpVdEx5LTlEalp1SEVubmpFbzZTaEFlTzlObkJjRTFxcDNZYzBEaHd0ODBCOExZZTByZm9PNFlNdjBhMF9pZzhsd1E9PQ==
