"On the DSS register here, waiting on a class date with a 5.3. (Yes I’m reBexing) 

I’ve heard this sentiment a lot and I get it. However it’s a different thing when you’re balancing other life responsibilities BEFORE you get in. Not wanting to fuck over your current responsibilities with how you exit your current role, maybe you’re finishing a degree, or maybe you’re even on military orders (reservists can hop on and off). We already have to put our life on hold to pursue this process. I think this becomes very different once the foreign service IS part of your life, is your responsibilities, and is paying your bills. 

I for one have intentionally set my life up for the application process and being able to drop things on a dime to go when called and I partially regret it. Im on the register and will absolutely take the first opportunity I have to go to a class but the nearly 2 years of waiting and working a stagnant job feel like wasted time. I feel like I’ve been in purgatory waiting on the beckoning call of an agency I’m not yet a part of. Which again I get it, I’m not unique in that and it’s a taste of what’s to come. I just think it’s unreasonable for people not in yet to do that because a lot of people don’t have the ability to set their life up that way. 

But what do I know. Still on the outside looking in waiting to start the journey. Hope this doesn’t come off as spiteful, I just think salty and experienced folks like yourself forget what it’s like to be in the hiring purgatory.

"I think people think ""oh, this will somehow get more stable once I am in the FS"" until you are supposed to PCS in less than a month, but you don't have an assignment, and you are desperately trying to find a Post that will accommodate your family's needs. Or maybe you wake up to a coup and have to get your family out of the country on zero notice, but you are staying behind to manage the crisis.

Sure, there may be a big, specific thing in your life, but in my experience many of the people who have thrown out vague statements like ""personal reasons"" have privately told me ""it would just be so quick to sell my house and pack everything up with only three months notice."" If that's the only hangup, then I have bad news about what the FS holds for you.

And you are deluding yourself if you think it gets much easier once you are in. The Departments is an administrative shit show. Every PCS is like the first time it has ever happened.  Your orders will be wrong. A panel will have forgotten to review your packet. Your orders won't be funded until two days prior to departure, so that's when you will be allowed to finally pack out.

In addition, a potential change in Presidential administrations can impact hiring and cause it to slow or temporarily stop (2025 could be worse than 2017 when it comes to hiring and onboarding).

"Thank you for sharing your perspective and experiences. Im not delusional in my thought process and nothing I said comes from a place of authority. Just my observations with myself and others I know still grinding for a class seat. The distinction I draw between the application process and active FS is that the application process has unique frustrations and unpredictability of being a transitional phase. 

For example, over the past two years, I’ve willingly passed on opportunities due to being in the application process. These included a year-long activation to Italy, pursuing a seat at the Basic Reconnaissance Course, advancing my education with a master’s degree, and taking a new job, only to have my position stagnated when my security investigator showed up, indicating to my manager that I might leave soon for a government role. 

Now, it feels challenging to engage in meaningful career advancements within the limited time frame available. Many in my hiring cohort share similar sentiments, feeling stuck and unable to progress due to the uncertainties of the application process.

"I can’t get over this dissonance. “Don’t pass on opportunities” but at the same time be willing to drop those opportunities on a heartbeat. 

Also opportunities listed would cuff me financially with starting a degree, or under contract with the military to where I wouldn’t have a choice to say yes to an invite. This being my end goal, that’s not an option. 

Call it what you want. If you want to be able to accept the offer no matter when, you have to alter your life to be in a position to do so. The blanket statement, “apply and forget” is such a stupid oversimplification. 

Say I took the opportunity to one year in Europe and a month goes by and I get invite but now I’m under contractual obligation to the marine corps and have to decline. Then what? I’m in the same position as OP. 

This was never supposed to be about my experience in commenting. Again, to the OP of this post. Who knows what their reason is for postponing their invite.

Same thing with grad school- and there are plenty of programs these days that make it possible to pursue a graduate degree while living overseas.

"I’ve been out of the system for a few years now, so I can’t be definitive, but I’m guessing the answer is “no.” Clearances are job specific, you would need a practical reason for the SCI.

Furthermore, you don’t actually have a clearance until you’re sworn in on day one of A-100.

"Everyone’s timeline will vary, but if an example is helpful:

-I took the FSOT in October 2023 for the second time (I did not pass QEP in the 2022 cycle)
-I was notified that I passed QEP in December 2023, and was invited to take the OA. 
-My options for the OA were between the end of January 2024 and mid April 2024. 
-I took the OA in March 2024, and passed but with a low score. 
-I am currently in the clearance process and have not received any updates. 
-I’m currently planning to take the FSOT again this October to hopefully start another candidacy. 

Considering the uncertainty around the budget and hiring projections, it is unclear how OA invites will be impacted, so keep that in mind also.",r/foreignservice,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVmhGSVVkNXNnaVhKNVVFbEFzdGc4aVJQUjRBS25MbWQwYnJldHpfYWFvVWR3elZjenY1SVcyZldiWW9LZzdUWEJjbWl5bDN4djRjMWROSU9JTkg5MGc9PQ==

"Assuming you pass QEP, which you’ll find out 8-12 weeks after the testing window, you aren’t going to be doing the OA until Jan-April 2025. Assuming you pass the OA, you’ll have to go through clearances which will take probably 6 months at least and likely longer. Only after that are you added to the register and eligible to receive an invitation—which may or may not come depending on your cone and score. You time off the register after 18 months. Once you accept an invitation, you have to wait to get and accept a salary offer. 

It takes on average 3 FSOT attempts to make it through QEP and approximately 60 percent of OA takers pass. But passing doesn’t mean you’ll get an invite—you can get on the register with a 5.3 but if you’re in the POL or PD track, you aren’t going to get an invite.

"It would indeed be unnecessarily risky to travel to such contentious regions for the time being. However, let's take socially-conditioned bias out of it, and acknowledge another absolutely genuine reason why one would want to visit these countries without any malign intent whatsoever -- all of those countries have their own wonderfully rich history, culture, and customs (not to mention breathtaking landscapes and archeological sites). Why wouldn't a reasonably-enlightened, wordly, and adventurous individual want to travel there?? I've always wished I could ever since I was a kid who adored history and anthropology -- unfortunately, due to seemingly perpetual geopolitics, it's sadly never a good time 😕


Nevertheless, anyone who decides to visit these  regions of the world must recognize and take full  responsibility for the potential consequences of their actions and shortsighted decision-making.
