"So, if I'm understanding you correctly, the original karst prior to there being soil here would have contained all the minerals that are currently in my soil? 

I'm not suggesting that the rocks that are still here would disappear with soil production.

"In my county & surrounding area, it's not unusual for folks to have never left the county. I had gone shopping at a national chain store and a man in his 20s helped me load my car. He mentioned he had NEVER left his town. EVER. A town of 42,000 (a VERY big town for this region). I was blown away. The next largest towns anywhere nearby is 13-15,000. The rest are between 2000-6000. 
Within a 45-60 minute drive, there are ""cities"" of 300,000. And most in my area have never been. Too big, too busy for them. 
Guess it explains the severity of the meth problem here. There is absolutely nothing for these young people to do. Even with the mills that are long-gone from the area, the population never changes bc nobody leaves. Ever. One dies, the next is born. 
It's a world of Dollar Generals, Walmarts, some fast food, mote churches than people, and diners. Lots of discount stores. Need services at your home? Someone licensed and insured to get your roof repaired, electricity upgraded, get plumbing to code? Doesn't exist Just a guy thst can ""do it all"" and pepole are cool with it bc their grandpappy's went to school together. Healthcare is largely absent. No Uber, no Lyft, no car rental, no buses. The local mechanic will get to it when he can.
I love the quiet here. The sound of birds and sights of green, even in our busy 3 block downtown. I do not miss the traffic. The long lines at the stores. I went from a neighborhood with 67,000 people per sq mile, to a ""city"" with 3,000 per sq mi.....and it still felt too busy. I moved a short distance, thinking it was to be my forever home. It is not.
I have moved every 2 years on average, largely staying in the same metropolitan area. Even after buying homes, swearing ""This is my place"", I sell at a loss & move on. I never really stopped to ask why.
I am Romani (gyspy) by blood. And I'm realizing I crave novelty. But also a sense of ""home"" My ""vacationing"" days are behind me. I don't think (?) i want a home on wheels. But maybe 2 or 3 scattered homes not bigger then 600 sq ft on a 1/4 acre and an old cargo van big enough for my sleeping bag.

"You’re probably looking at flood or debris flow deposits from a stream. There was enough water rushing through the stream during a flood to transport gravel. It looks like there is some normal grading in these layers: the gravel gets smaller as you go up and gives way to sand. This is because the waning flood drops larger stones first while smaller grains are still moving. There are two gravel layers, so those are probably from two separate events. A lot of the rock fragments look angular, rather than rounded, so they weren’t carried very far from their source.

Dry areas are prone to this kind of thing.

"Assuming the mineral is identified by the seller, it is usually easiest if you have seen the natural mineral before. However this isn't always possible. Some ""red flags"" that may help that come from appearance or handling alone are that the mineral seems to have no natural flaws or inclusions. Within the crystal structure you may see air bubbles, inclusions, tiny fractures. The colour of the crystal may also be too evenly distributed whereas the natural crystal would have colour gradients. The fake crystal may also be too lightweight because it's made out of lighter material. Crystals that are fake or synthetically colored may also appear unnaturally vibrant. A natural crystal should feel cool in temperature in your hand whereas a fake could be made from a material that adapts to room temperature. Overall if a mineral looks too ""perfect"" or uniform that can be another giveaway. Even beautiful natural crystals have some irregularities. 

An example of a mineral that is OFTEN fake is malachite. I have lots of natural malachite in my home so I know what to look for. A giveaway for malachite is that the banded lines are too sharp, there's no gradient between them, too uniform, sometimes black (malachite does not have black bands). Malachite can also forms with chrysocolla which is a light greenish blue to blue that I havent yet seen on fakes. Overall the malachite patterns can be very complex and hard to replicate on fakes so if you look closely it should be easy to tell.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOS1uWmc0dHNuWmxnRTVsSlZhLS1yMV95REI4WVJxTjRqLTBKdXlNWHVISUJPU0gzNmRweGgyZ254azNHdnpockJYZTZIUGhJVU1XdXNxbnc1NzV0S2c9PQ==

"Open University geology module, OU236 is on youtube - it's from the 1970's so very old style, but its a full series of 16 programs that makes a complete undergraduate module on introduction to geology.

"I wouldn’t speak of evolution when it comes to minerals. In my mind, minerals are the organized way that the elements arrange themselves, the number of possible mineral structure, although a huge number, is finite as it is finite the number of stable elements. 
The presence of a specific mineral structure doesn’t depend on time, if you have the right P, T and X conditions the atoms will form a specific structure, but if the conditions are met at T0 or at T1 it doesn’t make any difference.
So maybe you could tell that specific structures weren’t possible before because there weren’t the right conditions, but the structure itself didn’t need time to evolve….

"I agree with both comments. Rifts and plate separations are caused by the rising areas of convection cells in the deeper mantle coming up to the Earth’s crust, melting through it in some places to form volcanoes, but also spreading away on either side, causing the crust to start to separate. One of the big discoveries early on (before plate tectonics was fully developed and accepted) was the realization that on either side of a mid-ocean ridge or rift valley, the volcanoes and volcanic rocks get progressively older, with the volcanoes becoming inactive. By contrast, here in Colorado, we find the oldest rocks in the very center of the mountains, with the rocks on either side getting progressively younger. This is due to uplift pushing deep, very old igneous and metamorphic rock to the surface, pushing the younger rock above away to either side. The African plate currently shows very little movement, which is thought to indicate it might be prime for multiple breakups. The African plate could shatter into numerous smaller plates eventually. 
      The Hawaiian Islands are over individual “hot spots” in the mantle that form volcanoes on the crustal plate above. Convection currents are keeping the Pacific plate moving generally northish-westwards, and as the plate moves, the volcanoes (and the islands formed with them) that form over the hot spot are moved away, eventually becoming extinct and growing progressively smaller due to weathering the farther they shift from the hot spot.

"Yep, mountains are some of the most poorly preserved environments in the geologic record. There are remnants of ancient once mighty mountain belts that probably rivalled the Himalayas (eg. the Appalachians of N America, or the Caledonides aka Scottish Highlands), but the majority of rock that made them up and thus the record of environments that those mountains once contained have largely been eroded and formed into new rock elsewhere. A lot of the bits that remain represent the core of the original mountain ranges, which is why they are often igneous & metamorphic, these are thee  kinds of rock make up the crystalline basement and get uplifted during mountain building. 

In some ways, the best rock record of mountain belts can actually be the sequences of sedimentary rock that form in sedimentary basins adjacent to the mountains, often in a marine environment.

"Minerals don't ""evolve"" the way life evolves. It sounds like figurative language. It sounds like they are trying to say: the conditions that control the growth of minerals has changed over the life of Earth. 

In a nutshell, there are three big factors that lead to the growth of different minerals: chemical ingredients, temperature, and pressure. Obviously the temperature of the earth has changed drastically in the last 4 billion years or so. The same goes for pressure and chemistry. 

So you can claim that certain minerals could only form early in the life of Earth that can no longer form today. One great example is the transition from banded iron formation to limestone as dominant mineral formations that precipitate from the ocean. 


Before life started pumping out oxygen into the atmosphere, iron would form chemically in the ocean. Once oxygen levels got high enough, limestone started to form instead. It's easy to anthropomorphize natural processes like this, but it is not evolution. 

Simply put, the conditions that form certain minerals only exist at certain points in the Earth's history, so the set of minerals which CAN form at a given time changes too.

Minerals do not pass heritable traits from generation to generation. Minerals come from large chemical soups, not mommy and daddy minerals.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNTNsTThiMWIzUEFVRC1ncF9ZUlFsdGd1WmRkVHlzM1JFUTRzUVQ5WE5LdmpYY3dmWkpVNmdiWUlOTWExSW9PT1J0b3ZsVm9LRzk5VjdaZ1Z6VC1QbkE9PQ==

"Halite is a naturally-occurring mineral that has the same chemical composition as the (non-iodized) stuff in your salt shaker: NaCl. One sodium, one chlorine. NaCl is an ionic bond, which if you recall from chem class, means it’s formed by a couple of charged (have more or fewer electrons than protons) particles which bind together to make a net neutral compound. For halite, it’s an Na+ (one fewer electron) and a Cl- (one extra electron) bonding together to make a net zero charge molecule, NaCl. 

Halite, and also sylvite (KCl) that someone else mentioned, are evaporites, meaning they can form when a body of water evaporates that contains sodium (or potassium for sylvite) and chlorine ions. These ionically-bonded molecules are water soluble, meaning when you dump salt in water and give it a stir, you don’t just end up with a bunch of NaCl rattling around in your glass, you also get Na+ and Cl- ions floating around, because the water molecules are polar and have a positive and a negative pole which acts to weaken the electrostatic forces that bond the ions, causing them to dissociate. 

All this (really broad-brush and a chemist would likely pick me apart here) info is to give you a sense of the relative simplicity of the mineral halite, and most evaporites and ionically-bonded compounds: they are water soluble, because H2O is polar and can cause them to dissociate. So if you’re thinking about the degree of magically rigorous or complicated or however things work in your world relative to the degree of how hard it is to disassemble and reassemble these compounds, you can do it with a glass of water and some sunshine, respectively.

"There is literally nothing “perfect” about the “top surface with the angle”, not anything else “perfect” about this rock.

Look at it objectively.  Put an actual, man-made, straight object like a ruler against the surface and compare the level of perfection.

All loose rocks like this (we call them “clasts”, and they range from “boulder” and “cobble” size on  the large end of the scale, like this rock, down to “sand”, “silt”, and “mud” particles on the small end) originated from a larger outcropping mass of rock and were broken off by weathering erosion and then transported some distance, sometimes hundreds of kilometers from the outcrop source.  When such clasts break off of an outcrop, they can form in millions of different basically random shapes, depending on a variety of factors—the shape of the outcrop, the crystalline structure of the rock itself, structured within the rock and/or outcrop, the method of erosion, degree of weathering, location, climate, etc, etc.  Out of all of those possible shapes of clasts, many are guaranteed by the laws of probability to have some faces or edges that are relatively “flat” compared to others.

On top of this natural distribution and occurrence of the shapes of rocks that includes rocks with “flat”-ish surfaces, specific structures such as faults and mineral veins in the rock and/or mineral outcrop, as well as alignment of crystals in the rock and diagenetic (formed with the rock) features such as bedding planes and erosional features like unconformities in sedimentary rocks (not this one, which is a granitic rock—a plutonic igneous rock with randomly-aligned, mostly equigranular—meaning about all the same size and shape—crystals) can by themselves or together combined create planes of weakness in the rock or otherwise discrepancies in composition that cause “flat”-ish surfaces to form after the rock has been subjected to erosion.

Side note: (not to OP directly) there has definitely been a noticeable uptick in “how was this rock not made by humans” posts here, although it has always been a common question from people not familiar with geology.  I attribute such an uptick to the zeitgeist and current popular obsession with “ancient aliens” and “Atlantean civilizations” popularized by charlatans like Graham Hancock and numerous TikTok conspiracy theory influencers.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaelItYWdOTU01ZUZQd0VhUmM3dlVzM003ZVpISzhIaFpUMFNMaUxNYzhOdzVMVjFQVEhPTk5LTFQ3VXdlVnIwMkdHTHZ1UXFnVmFfLUtXb3drRU5VaGc9PQ==

"Yes I absolutely do! You can go to www.esovdb.org, that is my project The Earth Science Online Video Database.  There are over 6000 videos there for people of all kinds of familiarity with geology and related subjects that have been cataloged and tagged with meta data, and another 6000 or so that are sitting in the “submissions” table that have yet to be tagged with metadata completely but which you can still search by title and description too.  The videos range from documentaries and “edutainment” to straight-up lectures, vlogs, and more.  When I finally get some time I want to build a “Netflix” style more friendly user interface for browsing and searching the videos, but for now it is just a database.

If you click the little ℹ️ symbol next to the title on the database, more information about ways you can search and browse the current system is given there.

And no, I didn’t mean you personally regarding the statement at the end of my post, and as I said, this is a common question for anyone and even people who have studied rocks a long time will often see something and think, “how in the world was this created”.  But nonetheless I have noticed an uptick in “did people make this” or “how can this rock be so straight” type posts and I think in general the popular imagination has been stoked by people like Graham Hancock, and more and more people have been exposed to ideas of “the natural world isn’t what you think it is…and scientists don’t want you to know the truth” at the expense of actual scientific ideas.

Skin absorption is low. As an example of how low, Cody's Lab swished liquid mercury around in his mouth, stood in a pool of it, played with it in his hands, and still had normal levels of it when he went in for blood analysis later.

Arsenic has a half-life in the body of about 5 hours. It doesn't build up over time and you just expel it whenever you urinate.

When we talk about the toxicity of these elements, we are usually talking about constant exposure for 8 hours a day for decades in a lab or a lifetime of eating contaminated food like some rice crops. Or a single high dose exposure with acute symptoms. You haven't had either.

You could take a blood test if you really wanted to know, but I wouldn't worry about it.

"The thickness of a deposit is a very poor indicator of how long it took to form; sedimentation rates in different places are vastly different. For example, a landslide might deposit tens of meters of material in a few seconds, while in a low energy lake or ocean system sediment might only accumulate at fractions of a millimetre per year. Add on to that the fact that somewhere which has deposition going on for a while can have big erosive events then strip out loads of that deposited sediment (think about shallow water twhen a storm happens), and the geolgoical record is much more complicated than just a steady accumulation of sediment.

When we date rocks we are often using totally different techniques, like radiometric dating for metamorphic and igneous materials, which allow us to date when the crystals formed, or using the occurrance of particular fossils to provide dates for sedimentary rocks. There's lots and lots of different techniues we can use in different settings, and using lots of them in combination gives us a very robust dating system across the planet.

AS to climate, yes - understanding climate is important, and very useful. Rocks often tell us a lot about the environment they were deposited in, and that can help us understand lots about what the planet was like at a given time, and how the environments changed through time. It is a big control on how much water is in a system, and the types of erosion processes and depositional environments that were active at a given place at a given time.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaUN5a0l5WTBMakgxdVBBQl9mZHZZQjVLcUpNa2dKbzNxNkk5dXNUYTg0NEs3T2s1LWRJZy1BLV8wRFpjUm1FSEV4bmctaWlCalpWTnpyTVMtVXpkRkE9PQ==
"A blood test would tell you whether you got a significant dose, but mercury in that form is not considered particularly bioactive. Methylmercury forms in response to bacterial activity, and that's the form of primary toxic concern which accumulates in fish and contaminated solis and sediments. 

I didn't learn much about safety precautions with substance exposures until I entered the environmental consulting field. Now I routinely use protective equipment in any situation with significant/repeated exposure to dusts, solvents, agricultural pesticides/hebicides, potential eye hazards, and sustained loud noise. I cringe remembering school work handling heavy (likely chlorinated) oils to determine mineral grain compositions, with no personal protective equipment (PPE) at all.

"This one was quite boring and actually the pyrite was in so bad condition that it decomposed in a week or two. It was originally quartz vein in gneiss, not much alteration around this one. Then the quartz was partially leached and got some strange shapes like thin blades and spikes, all dusted with tiny 1-2 mm pyrite crystals. And the voids were filled with tiny pyrite crystals too. Might be fine for some bachelor thesis.

Some other veins in same spot are quartz + pyrite + galena, sometimes with pockets. Some have tiny arsenopyrite around contact of quartz with gneiss. Some have quite large alteration zones, some not. Rarely, also sphalerite, calcite or fluorite is present. Some higher parts of the quarry have late stage anatase inside the quartz pockets of hydrothermal veins.

"Another explanation is it might be human or animal transported.

It was interesting enough for you to pick up, it's possible someone else did and just dropped it there.

It's not a meteorite, that I'm sure. I haven't seen them all but of all I've seen I've never seen a 'white' meteorite. A [quick search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=white%27+meteorite&t=opera&iax=images&ia=images) shows 'white-ish meteorites from the moon'. But I highly doubt that's what it is. 

 Is it a possible weathered-salt-lick or animal-attractant/bait maybe? 

 If it came through the upper atmosphere at \\~20k-40k kph, it should be a lot more 'streamlined/smoother'. 'Sitting on top of grass' is not much of an 'impact crater' for something travelling so fast. And from its 'fragile looking structure', it should have cracked/broken on impact.  

Occam's razor takes you to up-from-ground-from-frost or human/animal-transport. To make an 'extraordinary claim', you need some 'extraordinary evidence'.

 A hardness test, streak test and acid test would be a good place to start to gather evidence.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhdFhyeElhRkJVd1F1UlVkb3l4NXBQQlFLZlFnbFJWcy1wV05BQjI5VThSV2RhWlNqY01lRFJRdHV2NFNlT0UtLThhZ3docW90a3hrd0hacDcta2ZZX3pHR1JnWGt2NXJfMkx0UDNoM1R5WnM9

"I used to take college geology students there for field trips. The whole area is pretty amazing, geologically. The red sandstone is part of the Fountain Formation, which also crops up at the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, Roxborough State Park, and in the Flatirons west of Boulder. It is Pennsylvanian/Permian in age, and I know people who have found Permian reptile footprints in that sandstone (but fossils are pretty rare.) The red color tells us that the sand was formed from aeolian deposits (above water) and was oxidized. As mentioned by others, the entire region was uplifted during the Laramide Orogeny. You can see excellent cross-bedding features in it. Nearby are some great dinosaur footprints near Morrison, formed much later during the Jurassic Period. There’s an excellent museum near the footprints, as well. Just north of the footprints (over the hogback they are on) is a road cut that was made when I-70 was first being built in the late ‘60’s. When I was a geology major at Ohio Wesleyan in the ‘70’s, I took slides of the road cut for my geology professors, as it was a pretty big deal then. On the very top of the hogback, there are also footprints, but they are hidden. Arthur Lake, a seminary student, discovered dinosaur bones at the top of the hogback in 1877, and became part of the “Dinosaur War” between Othniel Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope when boxcars of the dinosaur bones being sent to Cope were highjacked by Marsh. (Lakes had contacted Marsh first, but was ignored. Marsh used that as a pretext to highjack the bones.) 
     Unscrupulous collectors have stolen (and damaged) footprints, which is kind of pointless, as the shaley limestone breaks down pretty quickly. I have found dinosaur bone fragments in rocky deposits well down below the area. 
     Later on as a high school science geology instructor, I did field trips to Red Rocks and the surrounding areas. Great geology teaching opportunities that I continued with community college classes. 
    Red Rocks was once an important camp site for the Native American Utes, as it provided great cover. It was later developed as a tourist attraction, and was purchased by the city of Denver and made into an official Denver Park in 1928. My dad and his friends used to load up their bicycles with gear and camp out there while it was still fairly wild. The amphitheater was developed by the WPA during the great depression, and held its first concert in 1941. 
     It is a great venue, and I’ve seen many favorite artists there. I will add a note of caution, though. Although this may be changing due to global warming, typically the last week of July/first week of August are the two rainiest weeks in Colorado. The Big Thompson Flood that killed 144 people  occurred July 31, 1976 when nearly 8” of rain fell in 70 minutes. Several times, despite everything I know, I’ve still bought tickets to shows at Red Rocks in late July and early August, and it has rarely gone well for me. Or the performers.",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnWDN5XzN1c25GY2d1RW9XZ3ZEcThaMG9UYURjSGoxVDZWaS1tNm9GckdMUDdGNThza2hQNTJsZEI4aVhEZDRkd0RZdGlXN18xT0JhbFZPdEJMSzc2T0E9PQ==
"Despite how the name sounds, even an impression of an organism is not a trace fossil, it's a mold/cast fossil. Trace fossils are fossils of biological activity. Ie things like burrows, footprints, evidence of feeding and parasitism, etc. but not the actual organism itself. 

As for it being a bivalve, I'm not so sure. Not many bivalves have ribs this pronounced, and the ones that do have very distinct curves, often with parallel and very even ribs. These are not quite even or parallel and there is no curvature whatsoever. If it's a bivalve, it's something like a piece of a massive scallop",r/geology,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnSG5BLVVBNnFkY0dSUmd0OHJIVjBSRVltTXVrbE5xVkdUSHprVjNHNTNsS0VYb3hZZEZ0ZnVDWk1LRVdoaWVBdlhvMFVDbjNic2hNLWM3LU5yMjlKeUE9PQ==

"Technical climbing depends on handholds and where an anchor can be securely placed in the rock. Knowing the joint planes can help you determine whether joint lines you can see may be planes sloping downward or upward into the face, important information regarding whether a handhold is likely to come away under your fingers or if an anchor is likely to loosen a block. One of my professors severely injured her hand when she pulled a large slab loose while mapping a cliff face. Both fell to the ground, and she was able to avoid mostly being crushed. All except her hand. 

Geology helps you know the hydrology of how water flows over the boulders, where eddies and keeper holes develop, the typical patterns of meandering and how water moves sediment or erodes bottoms or undercuts banks, stepped falls and pools, how lithology changes can affect river development, the differences between smaller but steeper headwaters and larger, more powerful main streams, and more.
