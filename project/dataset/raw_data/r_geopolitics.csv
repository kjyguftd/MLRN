There was no issue in the past simply because Ukraine was not strong enough or hostile enough to warrant a secure border. But, after Ukraine joins NATO, we cannot assume the same.

"With regard to Russia, the point of sanctions is to impose costs. Forcing then to go through convoluted sanctions evasions measures adds costs in multiple ways 

1) direct price increase: every middle man and intermediate shipping location added to the purchase process needs enough profit to make it worthwhile,  So the per unit cost greatly increases.

2) increased lead times: the intermediate transactions and adding destinations increase the lead time for parts. This reduces production capacity since things will be sitting around waiting for parts longer. 

3) reduced quality: it becomes much harder to maintain quality of input materials when dealing with multiple middlemen. Especially when those middlemen work through the grey and black markets.

The sanctions don't completely stop Russia from building tanks. It does reduce their production rate and increase their costs. This has forced Russia to use older, outdated, and more vulnerable equipment. It is getting to the point where Russia is going to have increasing difficulty replacing lost equipment. They've burned through most of the easy to refurbish equipment.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYbVlZUlhRQ0RDVDEwVEUwX1U1dXVmWmQzMk9xQmV1b1ZJTFJiSVozaGdsNms1THpaT2Vta2R6blUxUWZYbm9pRGhjWTQ1QW1JY1RhdXNwbVJGWlFLZVE9PQ==

"One ought to point out though that this ""irresponsible advice"" was compounded to stratospheric proportions by the endemic corrupt mindset of the Russians (citizens, not ethnic group) who should have implemented that advice - both in the government (especially regional governments) and the ""Red directors"" - the guys running companies who suddenly found they did not have to give all their profits to the state, but could embezzle them for themselves and criminals savvy enough to do the math.

Imagine you walk into a kindergarten with a bunch of gold coins and candy. You explain to the children that they are each going to get a gold coin and they can sell it if they like or keep it and it might (maybe !) be worth more later.

99% of those kids are going to spend their gold coin on candy.

For many western leaders Putin was bad, but they were and still are afraid of the idea that something even worse might replace him, so they tolerated and enabled him.

"I'm not sure what sort of media you're engaging with to give you this idea, but Ukraine is not winning, and Russia is not collapsing. Nobody knows what the future may hold, but there is nothing going on right now that indicates Russia is losing, or is likely to collapse.

What this war has done, is force Russia to pivot to the East. Their relations with China and India haven't been better in a long time. Their economy has been reorienting to the East due to our sanctions. Their military is better today, than it was in February 2022. Yes, they've lost a lot of cold war era tanks, and yes, this surely hasn't gone as smoothly as they'd have liked. However, again, this has fired up their military industrial complex, which is state run by the way. Do you know when the MIC in the USA was last ""state run""? WW2. Their economy HAS been hurt, somewhat, but it's sort of hard to tell how much it has been hurt. At the same time, their economy has been hardened, making it more resistant to western sanctions. 

What Russia has done with their economy, is both a Demcrat AND Republican voters wet dream. They are bringing manufacturing jobs, both in low tech, but also in high tech back to Russia.

I'm afraid Russia in many ways is being strengthened by this war.

"Everyone should read  ""The World For Sale"" It's an excellent book that sheds much light on just how damn shady the global commodities trade is. Like for example did you know that South Africa skirted Western sanctions for years during the apartheid era by secretly buying smuggled Iranian oil from an American called Marc Rich, who had close ties to the Clintons? 

But apart from criminal elements, the global economy is now no longer Western centred enough for Western governments to have the final say on what goes on. Western ship registries and insurers wont touch Russian vesels so the Russians simply register them in Gabon and insure them in India instead. Westerners wont buy Russian crude directly so the Russians simply offhand it through ship to ship transfers off the coasts of Greece & Portugal or launcder it through refineries in India & otherAsian countries before its sold back to Western countries anyway. 

It's a similar story with Al Qaeda making a fortune of informally mined gold from the Sahel. They can't sell it directly to westerners so they simply launder it through smelteries in Dubai and it ends up sold to westerners eventually anyway.

A Lancet study (Kennedy, Harmer and McCoy) from 2017 found that: *""Saudi-led airstrikes have destroyed vital infrastructure, including hospitals and public water systems, hit civilian areas, and displaced people into crowded and insanitary conditions.* ***A Saudi-enforced blockade of imports has caused shortages of, among other things, food, medical supplies, fuel, and chlorine, and restricted humanitarian access.""***

China is undermining Russia's sphere of influence making Russia even more of China's junior partner.
Xi probably didn't like that Russia meddled in N.Korea, which is China's sphere of influence, and is now getting back at Putin a bit.

Of course this is also a show of 'strenght' an all that, to scare NATO and other actors. I'll leave it to everyone else's opinion if this kinda crap actually scares them.

But someone argued with me here that it's completely flase that Lukashenko wants to get out of under the Putin's boot a bit, and reduce his dependency on Russia, and because of that he's looking for an alternative in Xi.

Because of course Russia must love the fact that China is practicing with Belarus, in Russia's backyard. (Without Russians) And Putin is completely, totally, absolutely happy about that.

And of course they are practicing various scenarios, but I wouldn't assess that as a true, real, imminent threat, whereas that someone argued with me that joint Chinese/Belarusian invasion of Poland is possible due to this exercises.

"The thing is, that it's not just Biden. It's a long standing position of the US. The only other alternative is Trump's,  but that position is dove-ish compared to Biden's.

Obama for example already said that Ukraine is not a core strategic interest of the US as it is for Russia, that was in 2016. Basically same position as Biden, so if you wanted to blame anyone for this it would be have to be the Obama administration. But wait!

If you go back to 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia; the Bush administration was in power. Would you consider Bush's positions in regards to Russia more similar to Biden/Obama, or to Trump? I'd argue the former, because while Bush did make some empty statements about defending democracy, etc. even sent some aircraft and IIRC a carrier near Russia while it was signalling it will entangle in Georgia, in the end he did nothing. Obama for example makes mention of this, when he was being criticized for being 'soft' on Russia. You can argue that in the very early 2000s Bush was kind of 'soft' on Russia(thus more in line with Trump's foreign policy), as is evidenced by his statements about Putin in that era; but that rapidly changed from ~2004 or so onwards.

Furthermore, another key piece of evidence here is that while it was the Bush administration that pushed for Ukraine's ascension to NATO through MAP in 2008, in the end they did absolutely nothing to push Ukraine through, to offer them anything tangible, or to commit in Georgia. 

Based on these situations, we can firmly conclude that the US foreign policy establishment is never going to heavily commit in Ukraine against Russia. The alternative to the status quo, isn't a foreign policy position that is more hawkish; but exactly the opposite(Trump being doveish on Russia), that's the final nail in the coffin for your argument. The strategy in Ukraine is basically to hope that Russia gives up or something collapses at home and they're forced to retreat. The strategy isn't to arm Ukraine and make them win, even; we're dripfeeding aid so as to no escalate.

The international landscape is full of tension and disruptions, encompassing regions like the Ukraine/Russia Conflict, ongoing hostilities in Armenia, the enduring strife between Palestine and Israel, the disruptive Huthi actions in the Red Sea region, Venezuela‚Äôs strategic troop deployments along the Guyana border, incursions across diverse African territories, and the pervasive influence of cartel activities in Mexico.

Cyberspace has evolved into a domain where major powers and even minor entities engage in increasingly sophisticated and aggressive acts of cyber warfare. This strategic evolution underscores the growing significance of cyberspace as a pivotal and asymmetric battleground, empowering actors to wield digital capabilities to shape narratives, disrupt systems, and exert influence beyond conventional boundaries.

The information warfare landscape exhibits a pronounced asymmetry, with Eastern powers showcasing dominance and efficacy in shaping narratives and perceptions. In contrast, the West grapples with challenges in safeguarding fundamental freedoms like free speech, which adversaries exploit to subvert democratic processes and institutions. This ongoing struggle underscores the critical importance of preserving the integrity of information ecosystems amid pervasive disinformation campaigns. 

The utilization of economic tools, such as sanctions and tariffs, as instruments of warfare introduces a layer of complexity to the global dynamics of conflict. Trade disputes, economic sanctions, and tariff impositions embody prominent features of current geopolitical confrontations, contributing to market volatility, supply chain disruptions, and heightened business uncertainties globally. It is crucial not to underestimate the impact of economic warfare, with one billion people already lacking food security and another billion teetering on the edge. The threshold for triggering a famine through economic warfare remains precarious.

Even without formal declarations, the world unequivocally finds itself immersed in conflict. It is imperative to recognize that modern warfare extends beyond conventional notions, where a 15-year-old North Korean hacker can pose greater threats than an 18-year-old armed with a rifle, and where economic sanctions can inflict comparable or even greater economic harm than physical border incursions.

The historical significance of the Russian annexation of Crimea may be deemed a pivotal event that catalyzed a gradual escalation into the current state of enduring global conflict.  Of course maybe it was Georgia‚Ä¶

"Honest answer is that nobody knows.

"Propaganda is mostly for internal consumption. You don't recognize it in your own country because you're used to it. You don't recognize it, because you agree with it. You agree with it because it's been working on you your entire life. 

If you live in the country like the United States, it's entirely possible you will never ever see actual Russian propaganda, and if you do it will be so isolated that it's very easy to dismiss and highlight.

The idea that people in other countries are falling for Russian propaganda has always been a red herring. There are two sides to every issue. For the conflict in Ukraine if you take Russia's side, it is automatically blamed on ""being a victim of Russian propaganda"".

That entire line of thinking is meant to discredit the other side, with the implication that the only way somebody would disagree with your country's narrative is because they were brainwashed or tricked. The opposite happens in Russia as well. 

I've lived in the United States most of my life and I've never seen any actual Russian propaganda. I see lots of things *discredited* as Russian propaganda, because it's an easy way to dismiss someone's argument. But just because somebody in the US is anti-NATO doesn't mean they've been tricked by the Russians into that position.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZSjgxdnE0cmtlQkl0NU4xY1F3R2Z3UllMeHg1VHJjM1pRVExPZEZpTUpRUUNackJzVERjRFEtRlhkVU9jd1BIUFhhaVdHVTMxWFFfa1Aza1hRVm9oNWc9PQ==
"I don't think that they will ""implode"" or that they'll try to get to eachother's throats, that's not what I'm getting at.

What I'm saying is that each of them prioritise their own interests, and if it means undermining their 'allies' a bit, then they'll do it. At least that's how I see it as of right now, things might always change and we have to look out for that, and of course be prepared.

That's why I think that our strategy to counter and deter authoritarian regimes should consider the worst case scenario, and it should assume that they are in fact united.
Our countries should plan for exactly that, in order to prevent them from ever being a real imminent danger to the current world order.

I have seen people see Russian bots in places where it wouldn't make any sense, and at least here in Finland I see way too many people using accusations against disagreeing people very easily all the time now for any reason because it's so cheap trick to try to say the other is bad because being a Russian symphatiser is very bad here now obviously.

I might think this is on the people themselves to defend against. I mean lets look at Putin, he keeps things under his control, maybe it works for him, maybe it doesn't. Regardless people aren't any wiser. Why would we be different even if we would do exactly like Putin?

"You misunderstand ""economic reliance on Russia"". It's not simply about trade. 

Belarus is poor and can hardly finance anything in terms of infrastructure projects of any significant size.

Thus they are always begging Russia for loans and sometimes in the past they even went West for economic assistance. 

But begging Russia for loans comes at a cost - usually at the cost of Belarusian sovereignty. Look up the Deep integration. 

So Lukashenka would much *much* prefer to have other places besides Russia giving him loans, because they are far less likely to damage his own position.

Prior to the war, he really tried to get Chinese goods to cross Belarus on their way to Europe as a source of income. But the war changed that and China realised shipping across Russia and Belarus to the huge EU market was too risky. At least for now. And they have backed off.

The US has had a policy of sponsoring coups, insurgencies and wars and staging interventions in Russian-aligned countries (Yugoslavia, Georgia, Ukraine x2 and Syria are the main ones). Each such situation undoubtedly affects the ability of the country to conduct friendly trade etc - its trade partner is now a warzone, and if a new government comes to power successfully, it would likely hold a grudge.

The US also has had a policy of attempting to sabotage Russia's main new trade avenues, such as Nord Stream, military sales to Turkey, or Sputnik vaccines for COVID for Latin America (among others). Obviously it's not exactly good for the government to lose potential profits because their trade partner got economically pressured out of the deal.

"At one level that is perfectly true, but at another level the symbolic significance is very important. Chinese troops, even if only a handful, conducting exercises in Europe would have been almost unthinkable even a few years ago. In the past China has not demonstrated any interest in power projection far from its shores, in part because Xi's predecessors understood that the country's economic development needed to be prioritized in order to raise the standard of living, secure the CCP's monopoly on power, and enhance the country's power. Economic development required Western investment, and Chinese leaders were mindful of avoiding an overly assertive foreign policy that could scare off investors.

But things are changing rapidly now. Xi has prioritized security and strategic interests over economic development. The West has, however reluctantly, had to relinquish the illusion that trade would promote good relations, including the gradual liberalization of China, and mutual prosperity, and is gradually coming to see China for what it fundamentally is, which is a rival rather than a partner.

Chinese troops in Belarus is just the next step in this evolution.

Exactly, and you know who has attacked that idea more than anybody in the last 100 years? Trump.  That's what makes it complicated. There are now more than a few people who believe Trump is setting up to end democratic rule, and Trump himself has not distanced himself from that at all.

In that sense both the people protecting Trump and the people shooting at him honestly believe they are protecting the rule of democracy in America.  I agree with many others that it gets worse from here, because norms are built slowly and cannot be brought back as quickly as they were broken.

"The thing about Russian propaganda that most people don't understand is that most of it has nothing at all to do with Russia. The stuff that does have to do with Russia is what people can notice easily so it's all they focus on, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. Russia is behind a lot of the political division in the west. They do anything they can to make that worse. A lot of their stuff is wholly focused on the domestic political issues of the countries they are working in. They also have lots of different channels of dissemination. Media figures, politicians, actors, academic figures, influencers, religious leaders, they have many different people all disseminating the same stuff from different sources. Some of them are probably knowing intelligence assets for the Russian government for one reason or another, others may just be fed propaganda through targeted campaigns where they introduce spies to someone and just talk them up or they fill their social media feeds with posts designed to influence their thinking. The end result is a lot of people amplifying narratives that ultimately come from the Kremlin while having no idea that this is the case.

I think an important aspect of it is the ""demoralization"". They are trying to paint a picture of the world as being broken and corrupt and ruled by conspiracies which ironically makes the society more susceptible to becoming corrupt and ruled by conspiracies. It is a self fulfilling prophecy. Corrupt countries lead by authoritarian strong men and an oligarchic political class of elites are countries that Russia can ""deal"" with.  Have you noticed all the people on the internet on places like 4chan who seem to be completely out of touch with reality and living in an alternate universe? Well that didn't just come out of nowhere. Much of it is attributable to our own domestic media which, on the right, has largely lost all scruples and operates with an intent to deceive people at worst and simply feed them whatever bullshit they're asking for at best, but not all of it. Some of it comes down to the propaganda coming out of Russia. It is the exact same playbook that Putin used originally when he took power. Remember that Putin moved to take control over the media from the oligarchs earlier than he moved on the fossil fuel oligarchs. So even above the money needed to fund his government, he prioritized media control.

The media in Russia is sort of similar to how Fox news operates, except every news station is fox and they're all controlled by Putin, and any variation in ideological flavor from station to station is actually just for entertainment purposes and ultimately they all send the message that Putin wants to send to people. Because the same message comes from many differing sources, people tend to believe it. They pay attention to the hot-button issues but ultimately these are not what the Kremlin cares about. The hot-button issues are just there to get people's attention. They don't affect anything important (from the Kremlin's point of view). The important stuff is slipped in without people even noticing. The basic framework of thinking, assumptions about how the world works, all of this can be manipulated over time to control people and this is how Putin has gained control of his own country.

Now this model is being applied increasingly to the west. I think the important thing to realize is that Putin is looking to influence democracies by gaining control over their politics via the democratic process. They need allies to do this, and they have found them. They are influencing the domestic politics of democracies with the goal of promoting the candidates and parties that will be most ideologically aligned with them. There was a clear quid pro quo with the first presidential campaign of Donald Trump. He sought help from the Russians, he received help from the Russians (as did other members of the republican party) and he gave the Russians what they wanted by altering the party platform to be against Ukraine aid. This was the one and only change Trump requested for the entire platform. He literally just rolled over the exact same platform but the one thing he supposedly ""cared"" about was stopping Ukraine aid. You want me to believe he did that just because he's super concerned about Ukraine? No, he did that because he knew the Russians were helping him and he needed to help them back.

The same dynamic is happening in Europe. Anti immigrant sentiment is being amplifed by the Russians both in the US and Europe and in both cases Russia is actively trying to make the problem worse by sending more migrants to these countries. Remember the ""migrant caravan"" that was a thing in the US presidential election? That was traced back to a Russian disinformation campaign where they were telling people all sorts of lies to entice them to go. They organized it on the ground with internet campaigns leading to real life migrant caravans forming which was then used by the media to attack the democrats. Similar stuff has happened in Europe with the Syrian situation. Russia has been purposefully flooding Europe with Muslim migrants and then flooding those countries with anti Muslim propaganda which they then use as a tool to gain support for the candidates that are friendly to them.

I think this current political moment can best be understood as an attempt by certain members of the far right in western democracies to try and ""Russify"" their countries. That is to say, to implement their system of oligarchic control and ""guided democracy"" with strongmen leaders who rule over the populous using propaganda. The NRA in the US was clearly coordinating their propaganda with Russia and there were Russian spies caught red handed in their organization. Trump attempted a coup, and now the Supreme court has started handing down nakedly political rulings that effectively legislate from the bench and have started to take away rights people once had.

This is really a much bigger issue than most people understand. Russia is looking to destroy western democracies, and far right politicians in those countries are gladly willing to help them do it if it allows them to steal even more wealth and power for themselves.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNac0U5cjlwaG93OHB2bjkxQ2U5RlQ0MWRQMWpFLU1JUzI2bnRsSWFCVGZudDNUUGVwMjBsUVZhcWRhRGF2b0psb0pfc0lWR1pKTF9CdThpdE9GYk51NXc9PQ==

More likely it was just Mao trying to piece back together what was considered ‚ÄúChina‚Äù following the confusing collapse of the Qing dynasty and ineffectual RoC government.

"The Qing dynasty was indeed a Manchurian dynasty, meaning it was not a Han (ethnic) dynasty. Even Sun Yat-sen, who was pushing for the republican revolution in the 1900s considered the Manchu ""barbarians"".

However, internationally the Qing dynasty was considered the ""Chinese Empire"", regardless of if the Manchus (or Tartars as you can find in old texts) ruled over them. Since countries are ultimately a legal fiction, and there is no jurisdiction higher than a country to enforce what is/isn't a legal country, the closest thing we get to defining what a country is and isn't is what other countries legally think that country is/isn't.

Other countries considered the Manchu Qing dynasty the Chinese Empire, so it was the Chinese Empire. When the Republic of China overthrew the Qing dynasty, other countries recognised the Republic of China as the successor ""China"", meaning the Republic of China inherited all legal financial debts, treaties, and territories of the Qing dynasty.

When the People's Republic of China took over the mainland, the Soviets and the eastern bloc recognised the PRC as the successor Chinese state, while the US and the western bloc did not. Eventually, though the western bloc and almost all of the nations in the UN recognised the Communist PRC as the legal Chinese state, inheriting all the legal obligations and territories of the RoC, and therefore the legal obligations and territories of the Qing dynasty.

This is why in the 1980s Margaret Thatcher had to negotiate with the PRC over the expiring 99 year Hong Kong extended territory lease - a treaty they signed with the Qing dynasty.

Since all countries have legally considered Tibet a part of the Chinese Empire, consider the Republic of China the successor of the Chinese Empire, and the People's Republic of China the successor of the Republic of China, Tibet is a part of China for now, for better or for worse. Compare and contrast with Taiwan, which is de jure part of China, but de facto independent, and also (outer) Mongolia, which China had claims to but acknowledged Mongolia's independence in exchange for Soviet technical and industrial assistance in the 1950s, and therefore no China no longer has legal claim over.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaaUg0V250MEEwd016NE5wOGx1bms2Sld1eEhPdmItODdhdklBM1E5SGhtVGxLakFERjE2d2hyZUdwQnNWYnFhQWhEMjQ4Ml9TZlMzSTVDeUsyYXBYZlE9PQ==

This certainly plays a role and Russia, China and other adversaries will continue to exploit the divide. Trump recognized this discontent and used the opportunity to essentially win the 2016 election. The most accurate explanation I've come across, is ironically explained by Thomas Frank, a Socialist, in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPCMhwyHy0). Note, I am not endorsing Trump or Frank's political platform. It would serve the Democrats well to reconnect with ""working class"" people. Biden's policies have been designed to benefit the middle class and unions, yet there is a larger ""disconnect"" that remains. The administration has had difficulty balancing the interests of the middle class and the growing ""far-left"" contingent of the party, without alienating one or the other.

>The houthis would have used the fuel and money to their own ends, not to combat cholera.

except we know what actually happened when the blockade was partly lifted in December 2017.

"Submission Statement:



The latest data shows a 40 per cent drop in sponsored study visa applications, suggesting that visa restrictions implemented by the previous government continue to impede recruitment efforts.



Last month, the Home Office received just 28,200 applications, a significant decrease from the 38,900 recorded in June 2023.


This downturn in international student numbers could have severe financial implications for UK higher education institutions, many of which rely heavily on the income generated by overseas students. Enroly, a service used by international students for managing university enrolments, said that data from 31 UK universities shows a 41 per cent decrease in deposits and acceptances by international students up to the end of July.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNE9oeFVnYVh2VWswS3FvTnBTdUZXSmg0bnUwcjBieWtfS1RPUDJGb0VvaE45dWtMX2Vkd0U4eXU0ZVNlVHlrblhaWGtDUDlxY204OFR2UFR0RE1telE9PQ==
They provide a base of power for the Dalai Lama to operate from and have done so for most the Dalai Lama's life and he effectively runs a big part of Dharamshala as a defacto city state. I don't know what the Indians could do to support Tibetans in exile than actually letting them call some land in India their own new sovereign nation or literally trying to launch a military campaign to put the Dalai Lama back in power over Tibet.

Mao and Jiang Jieshi were of the same exact mindset that once they had won the civil war they were going to reclaim the entirety of China. Which to them meant what they could get away with in terms of historical justification and what they realistically could achieve with their extant military resources. So Mao once he won the civil war reclaimed most of the land that had fallen out of the various post Qing government's control and no great power militarily opposed them taking Xinjiang or Tibet. But the Soviet Union prevented any further claims on lands that were actually under Soviet control and Mongolia was a Stalinist puppet state which they weren't ready to fight for. Similarly the claims for parts of Kashmir and other claims along that the Tibetan border weren't worth getting into a fight for with the British Empire or the successor states for a while (war did come in the 1960's though).  Also once the U.S decided to protect Taiwan with it's navy Mao had no realistic ability in the 1950's to invade Taiwan and reclaim it unlike how he did successfully take Hainan from Jiang at the very tail end of the civil war.,r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaVVZXY0hDc1ZUOUx4QnBCQ2UxOG82RHlyenVkcVJrbXR5Ql9RZzE1b2tFemZsMDlUZzdjSXhibFdoS2tfMlpBRkl6ZjJPYzNhYWZ0ZC1LMFp1VG9qR2c9PQ==

"The West must improve its support for Ukraine, but sending military equipment is challenging due to limited stock. Most Western countries are hesitant to increase military spending, resulting in outdated or insufficient military resources. If the West had more equipment, it would be more willing to aid Ukraine.

To address this, we must shift the conversation from merely sending equipment to significantly increasing military spending. This involves purchasing equipment at higher prices for faster delivery, committing to ongoing purchases even after the war, allowing factory expansions, investing in military-industrial companies, and reducing regulations and environmental protections related to weapons manufacturing. Additionally, we need a cultural push to encourage students to pursue engineering and careers in weapon manufacturing, and we should enact lend-lease programs to streamline equipment delivery.

While some of these measures are already in place or proposed in certain countries, they lack widespread support. We need to broaden the Overton window to include these discussions.

"Estonia is not interested in committing diplomatic suicide by sending overt troops to Ukraine alone. The amount of ill-will Estonia would get from most of its allies following such a unilateral move is difficult to describe. Estonia is open to being a part of an international coalition intervention in Ukraine, that would not undermine our allied support in NATO and EU.

Estonia is not stupid. We know that our entire security depends on a strong Western security architecture. Our strength is being part of said architecture, investing in its strength and being a loud and CONSTRUCTIVE voice inside the system to steer it towards our interests. We can be the trail blazers in issues that are likely to see allied support in return. We sent (substantial by our standards) military support in January 2022 because that was at the time a move that was likely to and did elicit additional allied support to Ukraine. We sent out entire towed artillery park in 2022/2023 to Ukraine, because it was met by support from our allies.

Would sending a battalion-worth of overt troops to Ukraine as unilateral move at current time bring forth a similar reaction from our allies? Maybe. But likely not.

">but sending military equipment is challenging due to limited stock.

No, the actual limit is strategic considerations. Biden has stated he won't commit troops in Ukraine, and that he's not going to start a nuclear exchange. That basically means Russia has escalation dominance. USA's strategy is all about drip feeding aid to Ukraine at a rate that makes it so that Ukraine can't win, but neither can Russia. A balancing act, that limits escalation and relies on Russia eventually becoming war weary.

There's plenty of equipment in the West that we could easily send if we wanted to, but we don't. Just an easy example, there's about ~2k total leopards in Europe, about half of those are operable and could be sent immediately; we sent less than 100(?). The other half would have to be refurbished, which is something that is cheap to do; but we didn't even commit to it. Or we could just send them over for spare parts.

"It was never about defending Ukraine at all costs. It was always about entrenching the divide in the middle of Europe making the war appear something symbolically significant that all of us must actively participate in against the great looming threat in the east. It's one thing to proclaim how this war is a matter of life or death, how Putin is the new genocidal Hitler, and how this must affect absolutely everyone, in order to rile up the public and push everyone firmly in their potholes in the Western bloc (because the politicians must appeal to the public in the middle of the election cycle), and another thing to actually take decisive action that would truly answer the Russian resolve. It's optics, mostly. 

At a point where the situation would drastically escalate, the major Western powers at the forefront in defining the Western response, would lose their firm control of the situation, and that control would be outsourced to the troops on the ground, their leadership and to the hands of the two participants of the war. When Ukraine starts pushing beyond Russian borders with their massive amounts of armaments, they are calling the shots, and what could the West do about it? Stab them in the back? Or when Russian response is a new mass invasion with literally everything they have under total mobilization and strategic bombings, they are calling the shots. And again, what could the West do? Start an all out great war against them? 

In the end, it's all just a calculated and choreographic chess game where both sides (The West (USA) and Russia) make their own moves, wait for the other to make theirs, and figure out a new move. They evaluate the outcomes, and make a move that has the least risk of getting out of hand, but reaps the most benefit and retains one's control. The moves mostly involve diplomacy, deals, soft power and extremely limited hard power with strict limitations. 

Keep in mind, sooner or later, probably during this year, we will see a bold chess move from somewhere in the West, that bites the bullet and concludes that they won't be supporting Ukraine anymore. This will most likely happen under the pretense of Ukraine having done something wrong, like a sudden war crime with Western weapons (aka. collateral damage in an attack on a military asset, or just singled out war crime done by one rogue unit), or supposedly breaking the restrictions imposed on them by not attacking deep within Russia, or just supposedly stealing some of the aid or selling the weapons in the black market, in order to lessen the PR impact to any Western leader who first suggests it. 

I can see something like the Fox news or some other tabloid garbage clinging on to a story of civilian casualties in a Ukrainian attack, that reaches other outlets as well and a major audience, and once enough 80 IQ people are ragebaited into yelling how Ukrainians are no different than Russians and this is how their tax money is used, some politician will break the silence with his bold, strong words of questioning the Ukrainian resolve and endorsing peace negotiations or ceasefire on the condition of not sending any more support to Ukraine.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaY20zNzhhMWhLUzNnN2pBLVdDZEVybFV2MHUyd3Vqc0Fyei1WNElLeGtYQXltZFlfSHZ2NEhIdzB0VElVN3VYcXY3ZVhPTW9NSWpDMkI5VUY5VTdiVDZ6T2RtbGZUZUlUbTk1VWx3TkJXMW89

The chaotic privatisation and rise of oligarchy was done to ensure that the return to communism is impossible. Reformers really thought that they are running agains the time.

"It's not just the level or the quantity of corruption, which are enormous in Russia. It makes for a very different place when the population is convinced of that being the norm and what should happen. And when this is backed by an explicit threat of violence, let's not forget that.

On April 16, police entered Google offices in New York and California to¬†[detain several employees](https://www.wired.com/story/nine-google-workers-detained-by-police-protest-israel-cloud-contract/)¬†protesting a $1.2 billion cloud contract with Israel‚Äôs government called Project Nimbus. The deal, shared with Amazon, has met pushback from some employees at both companies since 2021, but the protests have grown louder since Israel‚Äôs renewed conflict with Hamas after the attacks of October 7, 2023.

Current and former Google and Amazon workers protesting Project Nimbus say it makes the companies complicit in Israel‚Äôs armed conflicts and its government‚Äôs illegal and inhumane treatment of civilian Palestinians. Google has insisted that it is not aimed at military work and is not ""relevant to weapons or intelligence services,‚Äù while Amazon, seemingly, has not publicly discussed the scope of the contract.

But a WIRED review of public documents and statements by Israeli officials and Google and Amazon employees shows that the Israel Defense Forces have been central to Project Nimbus since its inception, shaping the project‚Äôs design and serving as some of its most important users. Top Israeli officials appear to think the Google and Amazon contract provides important infrastructure for the country‚Äôs military.

"\\[SS from essay by Hanna Notte, Director of the Eurasia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and a Nonresident Senior Associate with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\\]

Since Hamas‚Äôs October 7 attack on Israel, Russia has enjoyed watching the deteriorating situation in the Middle East preoccupy its main adversary, the United States. On April 13, however, Moscow grew concerned when, in retaliation for an attack on the Damascus consulate of Iran, its growing ally, Tehran launched more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel. Although that attack was effectively neutralized by antimissile defenses and coordinated support from the United States and Arab and Western partners, Israel responded six days later with a strike on an S-300 long-range air defense system in Isfahan, a city deep within Iran. When calibrating their actions, both Israel and Iran signaled that they were keen to avoid sliding into war. Yet by directly targeting each other on their own soil, the two longtime foes suggested that the unwritten rules of engagement between them have changed, making it harder for each to gauge the other‚Äôs actions and intentions and limit the risk of escalation. This has worried Russia, which has been walking a fine line between undermining U.S. strength in the region and not becoming overly committed and does not want to see a wider war in the Middle East.

Of course, mounting tensions between Iran and Israel could have advantages for Moscow. For one thing, further escalation in the Middle East would almost certainly divert Washington‚Äôs attention and supplies from¬†[Ukraine](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/ukraine), where Russia is currently on the offensive. This dynamic was already apparent in the immediate aftermath of October 7, when the Biden administration sent additional Patriot batteries to the Middle East, drawing from a limited stock of systems that Kyiv was desperately seeking. In April, in anticipation of Iran‚Äôs retaliatory strike against Israel, the United States moved more military assets to the region to assist Israel‚Äôs defense. Then, in June, amid growing tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, Washington dispatched ships and U.S. Marines to the region. Further escalation would demand a commitment of additional U.S. resources, which the Kremlin can only welcome. Moreover, a Middle Eastern war would likely drive up oil prices, complicating the Biden administration‚Äôs efforts to tame fuel costs for the average American consumer months before the U.S. election. Russian President Vladimir Putin would surely rub his hands at President Joe Biden‚Äôs predicament.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaS1FyN2JuUUFaMW04dVBVYXNmVXN1UENfM2dTTDJwR014SWVCXzYwZXhYX1E0cTRkRkN3TXZXWU93d2JHNnluQmUxcGRoTTdOZ1FiYTZHYUxUWUtFQVRnMERJVDZ2UDJna053dkFhVmdmVzQ9
">NATO doesn't have a moral obligation, It has a strategic obligation

Ring that bell!

In fact, quite a lot of politics (not just liberal politics) has been failing by falling into the kind of thinking. Moralizing is important, but it can't replace anything else. This is Europe's strategic necessity. Failures (and successes arming Ukraine are not ""moral failures."" They are operational failures. These have strategic consequences. 

If Europe was outproducing Russia' on key munitions now... Europe would need less force to achieve security in the future. 1m shells in 2023 year could be plausibly weighed against a +100k increase in standing army strength... perhaps for decades.  

The actual force restructure that (IMO) euro-NATO is trying to make is a shift from a delay/deterrence approach to the Russian border to a denial strategy. IE, plan A is to stop Russia from advancing into NATO territory. Ability to deny also makes for a better deterrent. 

No ""space for time"" tactics in the Baltics. No ""cross the bridge when we get there"" approaches to the NATO response. Preexisting force structure. Preplanned, coordinated counterstrikes. 

FWIW, I also think article 5 is quite as strongly written as many think. It obligates member to ""*consider armed response*"" and to ""*assist by taking such action as deemed necessary*."" There is no definite declaration of war or such. A lot more handshake than ink... FWIW. 

NATO is an alliance. Alliances have various levels of commitment at various times. They are not an alternative to indigenous force. Europe has indigenous forces capable of territorial defense... of their own national territories... just not where they are needed. An Estonian ""*National* Defence Force"" cannot form the basis of Europe's front line defense.  Not even with allied assistance. Not even with the US airforce overhead. Other nations must be in the proverbial (and literal) trenches. Reinforcements will need to fortify border position quickly. They need to be supplied... where the fighting is. Not where the soldiers live. 

These are not moral obligations. They're security needs.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaYkxLZ21XSUtIeGw2T284a29CMlFuTC1iWVJXQ1dJQTM1VXJXSkl2MTVSTVJtQmNPdkswTHczMDdGZUw1Y0JIcDVPNjBZUXNEQUpPZXV5a1dKUWdCclE9PQ==

Why that system was funded and supported? Simple, America is formally a democracy of corporate interests for corporate interest since around the end of Eisenhower's presidency.

It's an inevitable result of unfettered capatalism in the information age where influencing people has such extreme reach and efficacy at low costs. The return on investment is too good to not take, if they didn't someone else would.

"SS: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. has secured an ‚Äúin-principle approval from the Vietnamese government‚Äù for a greenfield development in Da Nang, Karan Adani, managing director of the company, said in an interview. The project, which will have container terminals and multipurpose berths to handle various types of cargo, is at an early stage of planning and the total investment required hasn‚Äôt been finalized yet, he said. This will be the fourth international port asset for the Adani group after Haifa in Israel, Colombo in Sri Lanka and the Port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. On Friday, Adani‚Äôs new mega port in southern India saw the arrival of its maiden mother ship and the company wants to accelerate the expansion of the facility in a bid to grab a bigger share of the international maritime trade that‚Äôs currently dominated by China.

‚ÄúThe idea is to make India a maritime hub,‚Äù Karan, the elder son of Gautam Adani, said. ‚ÄúWe are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries.‚Äù Adani Ports is the largest port operator in India.

"Skilled migrants are common in both white and blue collar industries. I‚Äôd estimate my office has the same amount of expats as there are locals and first/second gen migrants (1/3rd for each), and this flow never stops. It is not that difficult for white collar professionals to move countries as their skills are largely transferable: software engineers, accountants, bankers, salespeople, consultants, etc. Conversely, many local colleagues go overseas to work to change up their lifestyle. The main reason I haven‚Äôt left yet is because I haven‚Äôt decided where to go, as every country has its own quirks and problems it‚Äôs facing. If I knew of some place that had a significantly better cost of living, standard of living and work opportunities, I‚Äôd be looking to move ASAP.

Even for migrants working other blue collar roles: in construction, trades, labour hire, etc. can find work in Western countries, although often times they work poor wages or are exploited, though sometimes especially for experienced tradesmen there can be labour gaps that leave them very well compensated (due to general high cost of labour in western countries). Even if not, people from poorer countries are happy to fill the gaps and immigrate to a Western/global city and figure out how to make ends meet - my parents did the same. An interesting trend is that even migrants from poorer places have been surviving in the property market due to their willingness to accept traditional large households where multiple generations live in a single house - thus able to contribute demand by having more people living and paying for mortgages.  

Finally, economic migrants exist and can push up demand when geopolitical events happen. When there were crackdowns in Hong Kong, we were able to hire a lot of good talent from people leaving the country. I‚Äôm not sure about other places, but I assume the flight of locals or return of expats would have hit many places in the world at once. In my experience, some (not all) of them were doing quite well, and selling a HK apartment to buy a nice house in their new country was possible - the expensive market in HK spreads out globally.

So lots of people can move these days - at an individual level, sure it‚Äôs not easy to buy a plane ticket and get through the immigration process - but millions do every year, so it‚Äôs also not that rare. Also note I am not blaming all property prices on migration - there are regional differences due to local policy, planning, global markets for resources and labour, etc. But I‚Äôd say the flow of migrants and capital/investors means global cities are increasingly more interconnected and so are their markets - it‚Äôs just globalism playing out.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNad0xqRVFSQk9Od0Rqb29IeUp0d3BwR3BUR1E1TE1tQTJiTGYxdlBfRnVqb2h3bDhFbnliQnpNV0RNY19NeURrakVGdGxtZHVnY3ZBR1pXeWF2TlhWeHc9PQ==

">the alliance said Beijing has ‚Äúbecome a decisive enabler of Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine through its so-called ‚Äòno limits‚Äô partnership and its large-scale support for Russia‚Äôs defence industrial base.‚Äù 

1. We in Europe have been funding Russia's war ourselves across the board at a scale that far surpasses anything China has done so far. 

2. China's DJI has enabled Ukraine's rise as perhaps the most competent de-centralized drone operator currently. Russia has of course benefited too, but not as much as Ukraine especially early on in the war.

The extent of China ""enabling"" this war, can only be argued to be in the economic domain which lies on the basic self-interest that is prevalent across all of the globe, especially in the West. 

Where is the criticism of EU enabling the war to continue, by being slow on sanctions, implementing ineffective sanctions, not implementing decisive sanctions, and also just allowing certain things to go on? Why did the SWIFT ban not include ALL Russian banks, some were exempt. Why did it take 2years+ to start banning CNC, something that at the start of the war would actually have a major impact on Russia's war capabilities? 

Where is the criticism of USA's strategy, which simply pursues a balancing act in making sure Ukraine doesn't lose; but neither that it wins? Biden is on record saying that he wont commit troops to Ukraine, and that he will do everything to avoid nuclear escalation. This alone gives Russia escalation dominance. Obama in 2016 already said that the conflict in Ukraine is not a core strategic issue for USA, but is for Russia--so they will always have the escalatory advantage. Where is criticism of this doctrine? It even goes back to Bush, USA did close to nothing when Russia invaded Georgia.

But sure, let's blame China; the great power that's barely been involved(in a direct manner) in Ukraine, instead of the powers over which we have actual agency and control of.

">Had Ukraine received the resources and support it was promised, the current war of attrition could have been avoided. 

That is precisely why it did not occur. If Russia performed better, Ukraine would get more aid; in proportion to the level of success(or  failure) either side sees on the battlefield.

US's strategy is to not allow Ukraine to fall, but neither does it want it to win. This is because, the strategy is based on managing escalation. Biden has said he won't commit US troops or risk nuclear war, so that gives escalation dominance to Russia. If you want to discuss this more we can go into it, but I'd argue it's a longstanding position of the US. Obama said in 2016 that Ukraine is not a core strategic issue for USA, and when Russia invaded Georgia under the Bush administration; the US did very little in response.

>Signing a treaty now would only delay a potentially more devastating invasion of Europe in the future. 

Russia has massive issues taking over Ukraine, how do you see it invading Europe? This does not sound like a serious argument to me. 

It's even doubtful that Russia would *want* to conquer all of Ukraine, I'd argue it would be incredibly stupid to take over western Ukraine, because the populace hates Russia with fiery determination. Ruling over the ashes of a flat country filled with people who hate you is very dumb. Russia would be better served to take over Odessa, establish air dominance; establish fires dominance and simply pressure western Ukraine to do as it wants(as it did in the past through mostly diplomatic/economic means).

"Submission statement: Writing at RealClearPolitics,¬†[Peter Berkowitz](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/peter-berkowitz)¬†analyzes recent essays on America's role in the world by two prominent former foreign policy hands, Robert O'Brien and Ben Rhodes.

As Berkowitz writes, ""The July/August issue of *Foreign Affairs* provides overviews of two main possibilities. Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications during all eight years of Barack Obama‚Äôs presidency, represents the Democrats. Rhodes urges the United States ‚Äúto minimize enormous risks and pursue new opportunities‚Äù by adopting ‚Äúan updated conception of U.S. leadership ‚Äì one tailored to a world that has moved on from American primacy and the eccentricities of American politics.‚Äù Making the case for Republicans is Robert O‚ÄôBrien, who served from 2019-2021 as national security adviser to President Donald Trump.

Submission Statement:

This opinion piece by Ohio senator J. D. Vance originally appeared in the Financial Times in February.

In it he criticizes Europe's military ineffectiveness and inability to provide for its own security, arguing that American support has enabled European complacency, in what amounts to a wealth transfer from American taxpayers to Europe:

> In the aftermath of the cold war, European nations made deep and lasting cuts to their defence budgets. Estimates suggest the continent would have spent an additional $8.6tn on defence over 30 years had they maintained cold war levels of military expenditure. As the American defence budget nears $1tn per year, we ought to view the money Europe hasn‚Äôt spent on defence for what it really is: an implied tax on the American people to allow for the security of Europe.

He goes on to argue that the US should end aid to Ukraine, and leave it to Europeans to decide how to manage the Russian problem. 

He is effectively arguing for the most consequential re-orientation of American policy toward Europe since the Second World War, one in which the US would decouple its security interests from those of Europe, and leave Europe to provide for its own defence (or not).

I bring this article up now because Donald Trump announced today that he had selected Vance to be his running mate in the 2024 election, and I think this has significant and interesting implications for both domestic American politics and foreign policy.

Vance's personal story is inescapably tied to his politics and political brand. Born into a poor and dysfunctional household, he joined the Marine Corps after high school, then graduated summa cum laude from Ohio State with a degree in political science and philosophy, before going on to graduate Yale Law.

His 2016 memoirs, *Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis* became something of a cultural touchstone in America. In it he discussed his troubled upbringing, the cultural influence his mother's Appalachian values had on him (though Vance was raised in Ohio, his mother hailed from piedmont Kentucky), and the crisis of despair that has overtaken many poorer regions in America.

Vance is highly unusual in contemporary America as being someone who straddles the class divide, having experienced both the poverty and lack of opportunity that afflicts large parts of the country outside the wealthy coastal enclaves and more desirable parts of major urban centers, but also overcoming adversity to obtain the credentials that qualified him to be a card carrying member of the country's elite. It is a personal story that flatters elite myths about American ""meritocracy"", and also grants Vance unique authority to speak about aspects of American society with which most highly privileged Americans have no direct experience. This no doubt goes a long way to explaining the exposure the book received, along with the fact it was published in the same year that Donald Trump stunned the establishment by winning the presidency, prompting a rush for insight into the voting preferences of poor, white Americans.

As indicated by this article, Vance's foreign policy instincts are isolationist, and this should be a wake up call for those who complacently assume that Trump will be willing to continue America's traditional role in the Western alliance as long as the allies pay ""their fair share"". The man Trump handpicked to be one heartbeat from the presidency believes something very different.

In terms of domestic politics, Vance is an interesting hybrid of populist economics and traditional cultural values. This is an underrecognized and underserved segment of Western voters, economically marginalized people who support redistributive economic policies (like the traditional left), but also reject innovation in social policy and identity construction (like the traditional right). 

This is potentially very fertile ground for political entrepreneurs like Vance, and Sahra Wagenknecht in Germany.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUW9GVFhqY0QyaS1ZNGdIMVRmYl9iZkJYbE1qbVJFSmVBV2ppdTB6eC12MlJ1Q01pZ2JsQ3J3ekYtczFpZ1l3SF8tRFAyWHlla1ZYVFJVTWZRbWFnQnc9PQ==

">¬†has been criticised extensively on moral grounds"" and the allies yawned. And then they did another blockade in WW2.

sure but the Saudis aren‚Äôt the Allies, they are unable to win the war either by blockade or conventional means and are beholden to stronger powers who forced then to lift the blockade. To quote you ‚Äúsounds like a skill issue‚Äù

>¬†The US and UN pressured Israel to not do the Rafah offensive warning of a bloodbath over and over. After three months of war continuing without end, they finally did it, it was a success, incredibly low civilian casualties, Hamas last standing army annihilated.

The fighting in Gaza is continuing, the civilian casualties are immense, the Rafah offensive rescued how many hostages? and the Hamas leadership survive. Is this really a success? Meanwhile Yemen is largely a stalemate with neither side making offensive operations against one another.¬†

"He‚Äôs right about the symptoms but not the disease.

Yes, Europe *should* spend more money on its own defense in the year 2024. He also refuses to acknowledge *why* they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs less about Europe freeloading (though there‚Äôs some of that) but rather that American foreign policy in Europe has been predicated on the notion that uncoordinated military expenditure in Europe has directly led to the most devastating wars in human history. If Europe is united by NATO against Russia and taking on the majority of that burden, I‚Äôm all for that. But it‚Äôs hard to marry the decidedly anti-NATO sentiment he has with that desire for Europe to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù. A NATO-less Europe all spending 5-10% of their GDP on their military has a proven history of leading to global conflict. Rather, Europe spending 5-10% of their GDP on their military and united through NATO is a much more stable environment.

People like Vance seem to be of the mindset that Europe can have wars that don‚Äôt concern America. That was true a hundred years ago, but it‚Äôs not true today.

It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see that providing aid and training to Ukraine is in our best interests and could possibly have a historically positive outcome for NATO countries for many years to come. We could have positioned Ukraine in such a better spot than they‚Äôre in right now if we would‚Äôve been more decisive and consistent in our original position of support.

"I understand your point about the U.S. strategy focusing on managing escalation to avoid direct conflict with Russia. However, this approach has significant drawbacks. By not fully committing to Ukraine‚Äôs success, the U.S. inadvertently prolongs the conflict and increases the risk of wider instability.

While Russia faces challenges in taking over Ukraine, dismissing the potential threat to Europe overlooks Russia‚Äôs broader strategic ambitions. History shows that unchecked aggression often leads to further expansionist attempts. European nations, including NATO, are not prepared for a prolonged conflict of attrition. Unlike Russia, which operates on a wartime economy and uses millions of shells to level cities while treating human lives as cannon fodder, Europe values the lives of its citizens and is not ready for such a brutal conflict.

Nothing indicates Russia will stop its aggression. Consider Russia‚Äôs repeated invasions of Chechnya and other neighbors. The Baltics, including Estonia, could be next on Russia‚Äôs list. To act like Russia is not a threat is ignorance. Ukraine deserves praise for stopping Russia‚Äôs advance so far, but more support is necessary to prevent future threats.

"the UN is a legal instrument and rhe UN charter is essentially the ""constitution"" of international law. One of the things it establishes is when countries are allowed to wage war. It allows three reasons to fight: 

1. Self defense against an armed attack.
2. Assisting other countries in their self defense. 
3. Acting on a mandate from the UN security Council (UNSC). 

in practical terms there are obviously limits to the power of the UN. But in legal terms the UNSC wields incredible power since it decides whether countries are allowed to wage war. It also decides whether countries or even individuals should be punished for their behavior. 

A good example of how the UNSC can do this is the 1991 gulf war, where Iraq invaded Kuwait. In response the UNSC ended up granting a mandate to the US to gather a coalition of countries to forcibly liberate Kuwait, and thus legally wage an offensive war. But it also established limits to how far the US could take such a war. 

Another example is the ICTY which was a court set up to trial international criminals from the breakup of yugoslavia. Here the UNSC decided over the heads of the ex yugoslav countries that their leaders should be held accountable regardless of what the countries thought. 

So a veto can be extremely significant in legal terms because it can prevent the UNSC from in your case determining that France is illegally invading Spain, determine that the leaders of France should face a trial, and even determine that other countries should sanction or even attack France in turn. In this case the only thing that prevents legally starting a nuclear war is the French veto. 

On a more current example vetoes on Ukraine and Palestine are the only thing preventing huge sanctions and demands for unilateral withdrawal. If the UNSC was purely democratic it is likely that both countries would face severe legal consequences. 

As everyone loves to point out the actual power of UN resolutions comes from the member States, but this can be said for any law, for instance traffic laws also only really work if people in the country respect them. So therefore the UNSC tends to use their power sparingly even when they can agree to act because the action will only be as strong as the states intending to act.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMmVtSFV5SVpCUVFQZGQ5UG1oTmxSVUFQYWdkZmtrMzVTZF9HMGFLelVXZV9yeko4UEJZUnlhOWtQY0d4SnhrdEcyNk9zVkhwMTFrQTdvUXFzamhKUGc9PQ==

"Well as I said countries have rhe right to assist in self defense. So it does not prevent anything in practice that there is no UNSC resolution. 

What a resolution could do depends on its severity. It could do anything from simply condemning the wars to order belligerents to act in a certain way, to imposing sanctions or even wars. 

What makes imposed sanctions important is that the UNSC can impart obligations on all its members. So if we stay in your French Spanish war, the the UN could theoretically make it an obligation for all UN members to sanction France or even make it an obligation to attack France or support this attack. 

For instance the war in Libya was done on the background of UNSC resolutions that made it a legal obligation for all UN members to sanction Libya, and later another resolution ordered NATO to use all means necessary to prevent a genocide. 

So the difference is not inherently the outcome but the legality of it. For instance the NATO intervention in Kosovo was illegal and all but two NATO countries have agreed it was illegal but they still felt they had to intervene. So just like the traffic law does not prevent speeding, international law does not prevent war. But sometimes justifies it.

"It's a common argument that the US spends more on defense than  European countries do, both in total and as percent of GDP.

I have often wondered if this comparison is a bit disingenouous, for the following reasons:

First, the US spends on projecting its military across the entire globe, not just in Europe. Most European countries spend their entire defense budget on defending Europe (France and Britain excepted, also Italy to a degree). Is it therefore valid to compare total US defense spending with total European defense spending?

Second, the costs of defense are more than the costs of paying for military hardware and personnel. Costs of infrastructure (e.g. most of the funding by the EU *per se*), the costs refugees entail (borne by all of Europe), and especially the destruction of infrastructure and the economy that results from fighting on your own soil (e.g. Ukraine today), can also be legitimately included as defense costs.

Finally, would the US be willing to match the costs that over 100,000 Ukrainians have so far paid in the defense of European *and* US interests, that of their lives?

Edit: I would add that if the US *had* actually matched European commitment to Ukraine between 2014 and 2022, instead of congratulating Russia on a  ""genius"", ""wonderful"" and ""very savvy"" move, perhaps we wouldn't be in the current predicament.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYm9OSDdvdEtUbXY1M25EX0k1X3c0TlFELV8zOHd0OExKVThDSVFxVVZfM2lwSzBSUVpfcnJGczMtLUFNMlFHQk1ldDVsNk5zUVNsWXlXa0dlM1pzRVE9PQ==

"SS: A Reuters investigation has uncovered blockchain data showing that Huione Pay, a prominent Cambodian payments company, received cryptocurrency transfers totaling over $150,000 from a wallet used by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. This wallet has been linked to phishing attacks that pilfered roughly $160 million from crypto companies, including Atomic Wallet and CoinsPaid. Lazarus is known to utilize such schemes to fund North Korea's weapon programs, maneuvering around international sanctions using cryptocurrencies. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) has reiterated that Cambodian firms are not permitted to engage in cryptocurrency transactions, highlighting the potential regulatory actions against Huione Pay, though specifics were not disclosed. Moreover, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has recently removed Cambodia from its grey list, recognising improvements in its AML/CFT policies.

">the U.S. inadvertently prolongs the conflict and increases the risk of wider instability.

The risks of escalation are deemed to present a greater challenge, than the risk of prolonging the conflict. Furthermore, you can also argue that a prolonged conflict is more likely to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia compared to a short conflict. If Russia loses all of its equipment, a lot of soldiers, etc. it will be unable to return to Ukraine at least for some time. On the other hand, if it were quickly defeated in Ukraine; it could reorganize and try again shortly.

>History shows that unchecked aggression often leads to further expansionist attempts. 

History shows that there's plenty of possibilities, but if you only focus on expansionist examples as analogy to Russia; then sure there's only one possibility. Consider the Korean War or the war between Iran-Iraq, these did not lead to the aggressor attempting further expansion after the fighting was done.

>Europe values the lives of its citizens and is not ready for such a brutal conflict.

This is why we're making sure the fighting is contained in Ukraine, we'd rather Ukrainians die than Westerners. Just a long standing policy of the West if you think about it. More applies to USA than anyone else, though; since Europeans have died en masse in multitudes of wars.

>Nothing indicates Russia will stop its aggression. 

They're limited by their capabilities. If your argument is that they're a potential threat to NATO, then you can't also argue how brave and capable Ukrainians have fought. It's one or the other. Either Russia is incapable of taking over Ukraine, and Ukraine deserves credit for its overwhelming successes; or Ukraine is going to get crushed since apparently Russia wants to go after NATO next. So which one is it?

"There is no inherent power in the veto itself. A P5's veto power is backed by its ability to prevent it from happening with or without the UN. When a P5 member vetos, they are just declaring that ""this isn't happening, because I will prevent it, using my military/economic/political might"".

Because a P5 is usually able to enforce this declaration, it is best for the country in question to follow the resolution. They are not powerful enough to do otherwise. Doing it via veto is also good for the P5, because they could have things in their way without bloodshed/economic disruptions, etc.

P5 countries will carefully consider when they make this declaration. If they make such a declaration, but cannot enforce it afterwards (if someone choses to ignore the UN and does it anyways), it would be hugely humiliating for the vetoing country and discredit their future declarations, making their veto power useless and ignorable.

So countries would not veto on issues that they cannot or is unwanting to enforce, even if they might not agree with it. In this case they would abstain.

In your case, France wants to invade Spain, and by using the veto power, they declare that ""anyone who gets in my way is my enemy"".

"The meme that the US military industrial complex determines American foreign policy is tiresome.

Post Vietnam defence spending peaked in 1982 at 6.81% of GDP. In 2022 it was half that. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 it was 4.81%, at the time of 9/11 a decade later it had been reduced to 3.11%. In the meantime the US had encouraged massive consolidation and downsizing in the defence industry to accommodate reduced spending, which is why the sector is now dominated by just five conglomerates.

It isn't about jobs. If the US re allocated defence spending to education, health care or infrastructure increased employment in those sectors would offset reduced employment in defence industries. 

In fact given the inefficiencies in the industry, it would probably more than offset it.

Costs of infrastructure (e.g. most of the funding by the EU per se), the costs refugees entail (borne by all of Europe), and especially the destruction of infrastructure and the economy that results from fighting on your own soil (e.g. Ukraine today), can also be legitimately included as defense costs.

No, spending money on refugees is not military spending.

"> How will the US MIC deal with a major decoupling from the European market? 

It's a misconception that the US MIC is heavily dependent on sales to Europe. Europe actually produces a lot of its own kit, and in many cases there is no available substitute for the things it imports from the US. Europe doesn't have the capability to produce a 5th generation fighter, for example.

For that reason there is unlikely to be sudden break in the armaments trade, and while Europe might try to slowly wean itself off American products, it will be a slow and likely incomplete process.

The US MIC will adapt. Domestic sales are their primary market anyway.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnS1BRWXYwU3VlcXZQSGlJQk1HeE0zSHlESnFIMGhmUG1STEdpbUlhYi1KTjVVWHh1aHZmMlF4QmZsb2t1RXp6UzdNa2U1WHNVRG9QNWQyRnc1NlRod2c9PQ==
"Iran's aggressive policies in the Middle East are shaped by a mix of historical, ideological, and strategic factors. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran's leadership has opposed Western influence, particularly that of the US and Israel, driven by a revolutionary ideology and a desire to lead the Shiite Muslim world. Supporting proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis extends Iran's influence and provides strategic depth, acting as a deterrent against direct attacks.

Despite the severe economic impact of international sanctions, Iran's leadership prioritizes regional influence and national sovereignty over economic relief. The nuclear program, while officially peaceful, serves as a potential deterrent, similar to other nations that faced consequences after relinquishing their weapons programs. Skepticism towards the West, especially after the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, further fuels Iran's reluctance to make concessions.

Internal politics also play a role, with hardline elements benefiting from a confrontational stance. Compared to Saudi Arabia's US ties, Iran's leaders prefer an independent path, maintaining their revolutionary principles and sovereignty even at economic costs. While ending support for proxies and the nuclear program could theoretically lift sanctions, Iranian leaders fear it might not guarantee security or full normalization of relations with the West.",r/geopolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnME5tbWxoMmp0YkItNG1XWFl3MzZzMWR3c09TR1NxZG40SlFFLVBTYmljU2pKaE00YkNMSzBGdUxCZk9YOGpTeVZ1SXZhM2V2eVI0Y0FHWVQzNVNUcGc9PQ==
