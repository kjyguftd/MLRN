The question raised was fully addressed \\[probably for the millionth times\\], by the Chief Prosecutor himself as he briefly explained to Amanpour why Israeli claim of democracy fails when applied to crimes at issue alleged against the two Israeli perpetrators.

He referred to even recently publicly available reports; Bergman and Mazzoli Report \\[referred to in NYT\\] One could go back to 80's and look at the COP Report - Deputy Attorney General of Israel who said that Israel is unwilling or unable to investigate crimes in occupied territories.  One could also refer to the Sasson Report. The Three Star U.S. General in DC \\[2019-2021\\] reported there is no accountability.

Nonetheless, If the government can demonstrate the alleged war crimes against the two are in fact being investigated; they can raise that defense as issue in court when warrant is issued. Instead, he and his colleagues have received threats from so called democratic state.

Russia had already become a nuclear power by 1949 and during the height of the Korean conflict there was U.S. attempt to intimidate China with nuclear threats at which point Russia said not to do so. This probably brought about the frozen settlement.

"The author, Bret Stephens, essentially advocates for a full-fledged war against Russia and elimination of Hamas and et al, to achieve peace. Instead, he should have at least provided a lip service on how possibly to save Ukraine while it still retains majority of the country intact and a two-state solution for peace in the Middle East.   

There is no defeating the Russians and Hamas is a philosophy, not a standing army that would, nevertheless settle for a two-state solution along with all the countries in the Middle East. His approach would also devastate all of Europe, among other countries, and end up dividing the world even further. In short, he is a war monger. Who thinks wars can still be won when it involves super nuclear powers. 

In relevant part, Stephens states: 

>A “peace deal” with Moscow that leaves it in possession of vast areas of Ukrainian territory is an invitation for a third invasion once Russia recapitalizes its forces. A cease-fire with Hamas that leaves the group in control of Gaza means it will inevitably start another war, just as it has five times before.

"It is nothing more than a sign of desperation. All of the Baltic states have said the same including U.K. and Germany, but the Germans are a little more sophisticated and may not follow through. Will this change the ultimate outcome; no, will it escalate; Russians claim it will. 

However, the support and tacit approval of attacks of Russian territories and other infrastructure such as the pipeline were previously targeted and has been ongoing; this is just an official announcement. 

There are also troops there, they have been there including U.S. trainers. Neither France nor UK have the troops to make a meaningful difference. They do not have the numbers. Poland has far more troops as a matter of context. NATO troops as a whole can make a difference to the extent that it turns into World War III.  

According to the Russian Military of Defense there are over 13,000 foreigners fighting in Ukraine presently, 6,000 of them have been killed.  Some other sources have provided the same numbers, though they note accuracy of the numbers are debatable. 

>While the credibility of these figures is unclear, in total, Russia — which also has [non-Russians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/28/foreign-troops-ukraine-theyre-already-there/) fighting on its behalf in Ukraine — claims 13,000 foreigners have fought for Kyiv and around 6,000 have died.

"It is important to note that United 24 is a Media Group launched by Zelensky. This sounds more like a poor attempt at deflection because Zelensky has consistently advocated boycott of Russia including shaming businesses and entities and even employing threats against countries that did not completely boycott Russia. Although the majority of the businesses still remain in Russia; Zelensky was successful in his attempts to force most EU countries to boycott Russian Olympic athletes and entire teams from participation \\[despite much opposition\\]. So, he is now just going to equate any attack with events of Olympics.   

Knowing that a Russian offensive may be in the offing Macron tried to play cute by offering Russia a peace treaty during the Olympics in France, Putin mocked it by noting the general boycott of Russian athletes and those that have allowed some individuals to participate they only may do so without the display of Russian flags or anthem and under a neutral flag. I believe Putin was thinking more about another Minsk type stunt by EU.    

A major offensive may well come in June or July, but it is related to weather and climate conditions in that region, preparation and coordination. Although Russia has not made public the specifics of the multiple incursion points; Putin did announce early in March creation of a sanitary or buffer zone because of deadly attacks on Belgorod by Ukrainian forces primarily targeting civilians. 

A month after the initial announcement during a trip to China Putin noted that the present intent was not to capture Kharkiv but only to create a buffer zone. He added, though the extent of buffer zone could change depending on the conditions. 

All of Europe and U.S. knows this, presently the Russian backup reserve in that area is only about 100,000; there will likely be at least another 100,000 to 200,000 before Putin makes his move. Ukraine claims its defense will depend on being allowed to use Western arms to strike military targets across the border in Russia, \\[along with troops to operate the machineries.\\] This is a big issue that most of EU and US is preparing for. 

However, Russia is not just standing still. It too, as always, preparing for a bigger war. Putin just hosted the Taliban leaders, and he is expected to announce it no longer considers it a terrorist group. Likely followed by recognition as the legitimate or only government in Afghanistan. The visit coincides with his visit to several other countries who are a part of Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the military alliance formed by the Collective Security Treaty Organization. I will not be surprised if several hundred thousand will be joining the war on the Russian side depending on the extent of missile attacks that strike Russia and number of NATO troops in Ukraine. 

All indications are the war is about to get much more intense and expansive. Although Russia has not drawn any redline, I think F-16s may be one, along with certain long-range missile attack in old Russia that could result in a major retaliation by Russia, outside of Ukraine.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsVWF1RExpYVJCTkduYXBxY045My1LQjBFenUtWUcwejMwTlY3OXM3TTJTV0lkNGtoT1diZUlTZWlSNHYycThvZndHNDh6QjY4cUN1Uk8yVmNLYU1Fd3c9PQ==
"Are the Russians at fault for publishing its own content about the war? Or are those republishing the stories committing some sort of a crime. It is kind of like Israel's recent ban of Al Jazeera.

Earlier this week BBC went crying to its government to increase its funding because it cannot keep up with RT in the rest of the world. In fact, asking for full funding. 

It is futile to try to prohibit communication because now there are tens of thousands of social outlets to spread the ""news.""  India also tried it with BBC; shutting down its office because it upset Modi. It did not prevent dissemination of information. 

Decades ago, my constitutional law professor once said to me; the way to fight misinformation is to fight with more speech, not by banning speech. He was a strong advocate of free speech.

Both, Russia and China are nuclear powers; if we can exclude it due to MAD Doctrine; we certainly need more men and women on the ready.

"The rules are changing now as most NATO countries openly admit direct participating. They have always been a participant, but now are a little more open about it. Therefore, I will not be surprised that Russia increasingly may view several of the Baltic states as a threat. 

U.S. first, and EU later wanted further NATO expansion, now they have to fight for it. Russia wants a neutral Ukraine with an expanded buffer zone. If Russia can be made a target of NATO weapons; it would be foolish to think Russians will just stand by. 

However, I do not believe Russia has a greater design, the only country that did was the US that wanted to surround Russia, first with turning the Baltic States into NATO, but it crossed the line with Ukraine. Now it must defend its ambitions.

"Not a shred of evidence that U.S. is helping Hamas presently.  However, it is not unusual for U.S. to work closely with terrorists and extremists of all sorts when it serves our purpose.  Netanyahu himself supported Hamas and made it an obstacle for Palestinian Authority to reach a solution and he later bragged about it. 

U.S. worked very closely with ISIS and also supported and funded it and propped it up to fight against Assad; until Russians screwed up the plan. U.S. also funded Islamists in the Afghan war including Osama in trying to oust the USSR. We worked with Saddam in its war against Iran.  It is not any different than Zelensky working with Azov. 

In short, we are not any more moral than a pit bull when it comes to preserving our interests to rule the world. Except, pit bulls can remain loyal, but we can turn on our allies on a dime. We have demonstrated that time and again.    

I am not sure if Biden is ready to turn on Netanyahu just yet, but if Netanyahu continues to delay the peace plan, there is a likelihood he will. Not to support Hamas but get someone in power who will say yes like a robot to a peace deal. 

I also think there is a possibility of Biden turning on the Comedian turn Dictator. The only question is who he will use to topple him.

"I suppose being a hostage is probably quite close to being taken a prisoner by an enemy who may consider you of some value, such as in a prisoner exchange or perhaps of no value at all. The hostage has no assurance or any guarantees of getting out alive from a situation like that and indeed some do not. They could face torture and if injured uncertainty of treatment and food insecurity.  

What makes it a really terrible ordeal in my opinion is that someone who is taken hostage is innocent, and the hostage taker knows this, but does not care. Even where there is no abuse involved by the hostage or prisoner taker; there is never any assurance of safe return, where it is accompanied with abuse that just further dehumanizes the person.

"How do these claims impact or influence young people in Europe or the U.S.  Anytime the Netanyahu government denies anything their internal autoboot with a relatively well-developed conscience rejects it. Survey and polling from across the world demonstrates it. 

There was widespread support for Isarael after the immediate aftermath of October 7th and for it to act in self-defense. The support did not just come from the collective West, but also included several Muslim countries in the Middle East.  

That support has evaporated and in some European countries completely turned against Israel. The masses no longer believe that Israeli is acting in self-defense. 

To the world at large there is simply no way to justify the civilian deaths that continues to occur in Gaza and the West Bank.

"Years prior to the Special Military Operation Rand Corporation in 2019 published a paper \\[Extending Russia\\] laid out its strategy on how to force Russia in an extended competition/war \\[from Donbass onward\\]; impose increasingly harsh sanctions, using brain drain strategies and ultimately crippling its economy resulting in a fall of Russia much like USSR.

U.S. followed the strategy but failed at every turn. This will not be any different, besides Ukraine has been attacking Russian land for a very long time with the help of its allies. Russia is actually stronger today both economically and militarily.

As far as supplying weapons, U.S. and its NATO allies have been doing that all over the world; Russia can provide major missiles technologies, to Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, several African countries and God knows who else. They may also include non-state actors.

In the interim Ukraine gets demolished. Like all other Western strategies, this too is a losing strategy. Russia cannot be overextended. It does not have bases all over the world unlike the U.S. A little one in Syria and some ordinary peacekeepers in African countries and a small contingent in Moldova.

The most important thing that Ukraine needs is hundreds of thousands of troops to fight in Russia. So far NATO has not demonstrated any real balls; I am starting to think it does not have any. It escalates hoping for a Miricale. It can only bring more devastation to Ukraine. In any event, if things escalate too far, no one should expect China to be asleep at the wheels.

"What choice does he have. I do not believe there has ever been any change in his stance. He has always said he wants all of the lost territories back including Crimea. Crimea was lost in 2014. And low-level conflict was ongoing prior to that and long before Zelensky came to power in 2019. His platform was about bringing peace in Ukraine and an end to conflict. 

Since he has been in power, the best time to have secured a deal with the exception of Crimea is long gone. It was lost shortly after invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 

Zelensky, cannot accept concessions, were he to change his tune now, many will turn on him including AZOV as well as his most important allies, the U.S. and U.K.  If his allies pressure him to leave or his own population try to force him out, he can just step out of office since there are no unexpired terms as his official term ended on May 19, 2024. 

It does not look like he is going to get any territory back since that would require a defeat of Russia and there is no chance of that. There is a better chance of initiating World War III than getting the annexed territories back. 

I do not think there is any politician who would want to be in his situation, I do not see any winning option on his terms. There is a reason why he is often given to outbursts even against the U.S. He likely feels he was encouraged to fight a war because U.S. and U.K. would do far more than they are doing now or have ever done.

"Proff. Snyder sometimes sounds a bit high on his own hype a lot of the time. Like, no: we are not in 1938. This is nothing like 1938 and no matter how that comparison seems to resonate with people, it's kind of telling that Timothy Snyder resorts to such a ridiculous simplification when he's an apparent academic expert in this era (published does not equal highly regarded). 


There are massive contextual differences between now and the situation in Europe, in 1938. Back then in that the populations of Britain and France were massively against risking a repeat of the Great War still fresh in everyone's memories and the US was still incredibly isolationist. 

Today, large scale war is almost unthinkable for most populations in Western Europe, which would be the primary combatants in Proff. Snyder's dream scenario, and the world economy is far more interconnected than it was in the 1930s, further complicating matters (as can be seen from the difficulty in crippling the Russian economy through sanctions). 

Furthermore, he completely neglects the single most significant factor in great power conflict since the WW2 era he's fond of comparing to: Nuclear Weapons. Which by necessity and design HAS to change every involved party's risk calculus when considering escalating through direct action. 

In short...just because some academic has an opinion, doesn't make it a well considered opinion or even a generally supported position by other academics in that same field of expertise. Most historians and international relations experts prefer to contrast historical periods by pointing out the differences in context rather than draw oversimplified clickbaity comparisons that only appeal to the uneducated masses who are hunting for opinion confirmation rather than actual analysis.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4T183OTZxcFJyRGVtWFBySGRvcVV4MDV2cEJ3VlY2dGJieVFqNUVtZm1WYTNsLWtEXzZPTi1iWTlDajloNG81dUh1WjNrT0hpNFFxQ2Nvak5YYW5vM2c9PQ==
"Last month when Putin replaced Sergei Shoigu with Andrei Belousov as the Russian Defense Minister, some at that time in the West said it was a purged too. Ignoring two important facts at that time \\[though this article recognizes that\\]. Frist, that Russia had switched to the war economy as demonstrated by the appointment of Belousov, an economist by trade with extensive experience. To an economist everything is viewed from the foundation of economic relatedness.  The EU media also ignored the fact that Shoigu was appointed the Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation position, an extremely powerful position.  

There have been some purges and when there is Russia announces the reasons and it generally comes with criminal charges for bribery. Russia has a degree of corruption and things that could have gone undetected in the past are no longer tolerated. The purges have generally occurred at the mid-levels. 

The new appointment and replacement are similarly geared to accommodating the national needs of the country from the perspective of war footing. Putin is looking to defend against the combined undermining of the West and most of EU who recently openly talked about.  Among other things, his goal is to make sure military families are taken care of whatever their needs might be and returning soldiers needs are addressed accordingly.  As well as making the country more patriotic.

"Just because the Europeans and the West is going all over the world trying to purchase shells to meet Ukrainian needs, does not mean Russia is too.  I do not buy the headline for a split second. Even the West and EU acknowledges that Russia produces 3 to 7 times more ammunition than combined capacity of the greater West. Russia produces far more than it expands. And it has been expanding that capacity further to meet the possible escalation.

Russian and Korean relationship go back many decades Putin recently noted that the Soviet army helped liberate them from Japanese occupation in 1945 and that Moscow was the first to recognize the DPRK and establish diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. The USSR also helped rebuild the country after the devastation of the Korean War (1950-1953) with the US-backed South.

This trip is more related to the increasing rhetoric from the Western backed EU countries and other allies that it is expanding and arming for potential conflict with Russia including some countries that will be sending its military amid evidence that there are already some NATO troops there.  

In response, Russia had warned that it can similarly arm its allies and strike the interests of its opponents wherever they might be. This is probably more likely related to that.

"Looks like the recent news about thriving Russian economy really got to the author Aura Sabadus.  Only recently the FT noted Russian gas export to EU surpassed the amount sold by U.S. for the first time since 2022 in May of 2024. 

Sanctions on Russian energy has failed. The world knows it. U.S. is still struggling to impose other sanctions. Just last week the U.S. Treasury took additional action against secondary Russian dealers such as China and India who sell oil and or gas to third parties. Russia responded by removing dollar from its currency exchange \\[except over-the-counter dealers.\\] There is no indication this will deter either China, India, Russia or anyone else. 

Perhaps, the author is perturbed a bit about the latest World Bank announcement from earlier this month: ""Russia overtakes Japan to become the fourth largest economy in the world in PPP terms. The Russian economy has overtaken Japan to become the fourth largest in the world in PPP terms (purchase power parity), according to revised data from the World Bank released at the start of June.""

Even Biden knows better, a few days into the war and after the first sanctions Biden in a press conference was celebrating how US destroyed the Russian economy overnight. Rubel is thriving. China and Russia alone now exclusively deal in Rubels and Yuan.  To make matters worse for U.S. Saudi Arabia refused to renew the 50-year-old contract involving Petro Dollar and is now openly dealing in many other foreign currencies including Rubels.

"He was facing several charges some dubious and others exaggerated. The most serious of the allegations originated in the U.S. concerning Espionage. An exaggeration, given the facts.  

The dubious charges primarily stemmed likely under foreign influence in Sweden and Australia after the leaks. The Sweden charges or inquiries ordinarily described in U.S. media as rape or sexual assault. The sexual charges came forth after two adults came forward claiming they each had a consensual sexual encounter with him \\[once upon a time\\]; that he \\[Assange did not have a condom during the encounter.\\]  It is against the law in Sweden.

Assange sought Asylum in in the Ecuadorian Embassy in UK. He lived in isolation in the Embassy and in failing health for seven years until he was forced to evict the Embassy due to pressure from U.K and US. After Assange was forcefully evicted from the Embassy \\[also under foreign influence.\\] U.S. had been seeking extradition and Assange fought the case. During this time, he spent 5 years in prison in a little cell.  

In the interim all the dubious charges against him about sexual allegations were dropped; once he was evicted from the Embassy it was revived again only to be dropped again for good because of questionable evidence. He is now free to return to Australia. 

U.S. could have given him 175 years because he published information provided handed to him by Manning who himself searched out Assange to deliver the documents. This is not about some spy. He always maintained his innocence about sexual assault as well; time vindicated him on sexual assault of no condom. He is not a real spy, and you add up 5 years in a cell and 7 under house arrest \\[while he remained locked in Embassy\\] is more than ample time served.

Some people wanted to sentence him to death for espionage, others sympathized with him.  This is not an espionage case \\[never was\\]; this is a case about a publisher who was handed a story and decided to publish it. However, the publication caused the U.S. government to be embarrassed \\[along with some others\\] about their own duplicitous conduct.

DiResta talked about the lawsuits related to her work at the center in a piece published in The Atlantic earlier this month.

“Meanwhile, conservative groups are suing my former colleagues and me,” DiResta said in the article. “Stanford has run up huge legal bills. SIO’s future is unclear, and its effort to monitor election-related misinformation has been shelved.”

"Have we ever fought a war either directly or indirectly where natural resources or sphere of influence did not play the primary role. Perhaps, many in the West will claim it was or has been and still is for liberal democracy or hegemony. 

The rest of the world soundly rejects that notion \\[many always did, but now most do so openly\\]. We do not want the Donbass region to be under the influence of the Russians and the Chinese; we want coal \\[for now\\] and lithium in the long run \\[for chips\\] and energy resources for ourselves and to sell to others when lithium is made more accessible and developed.  

It is not about saving Ukrainians, never was and certainly not bringing democracy. As situation in Ukraine gets more desperate, so do we. Recently, U.S. decided that it was acceptable to arm the Azov. Nothing wrong with that, but that is the same group that has consistently lost battles and now avoids frontal attacks or first line defenses.  

American and German politicians as well as businessmen have stated so publicly; explaining we cannot allow Russia to have Donbass.  However, geography nor geopolitics is on our side now. It is a losing battle; a settlement will be reached, and Ukraine will not be under the sphere of influence of the West. 

There is another option, a full-scale war with Russia and its allies. Since that entails devastation for all involved with potential use of nuclear bombs, where there will be no winners; it is better we stop the killing and not allow the last Ukrainian to die for something \\[lithium\\] that is buried deep under the ground.  

We can always fight another day for lithium; for now, China, U.S. and Chile have enough.

Besides, even when Ukrainians claimed they were intercepting 90% of the incoming; even assuming it is true, which it likely is; Russia was using them to deplete the Ukrainian resources; it is still doing this. Russia can produce tens of thousands of drones on a monthly basis and its capacity has only increased; Ukraine and its allies cannot keep up. 

The underlying problems Ukraine has cannot be reversed because it takes years to train real good soldiers and officers. The most recent recruits from the prison system are a waste of time. 

Orban is right, it is time to make peace while there is still time. The death and destruction need to stop and no Russia is not going to unless and until West comes to its senses that there is no NATO in the cards for Ukraine or Georgia.

"The headline in substance states Putin's position so it is correct so far as it goes. However, the reasons for not continuing forward are not Russian lack of capacity.  

The new Russian attacks are to create a buffer zone only. It is close to reaching its goals. However, if attacks on Belgorod continues things could change \\[may move further into Kharkiv region\\]. Difference is only that the New York Times implies Russia's intent was to continue to acquire more territories and continue to move forward. This is not its goal at this time; not lack of capacity.

"When a country declares a neutral status such as China and Inda towards the Ukrainian conflict \\[among many others\\] these countries are free to trade with the warring parties.  This is just a ploy to try to demonstrate China is not a neutral country. 

It will not work because China will continue to trade with Russia as will India \\[and others\\]. Unilateral sanctions may well be imposed by the U.S. and some EU countries. China will retaliate and this will cause all parties to suffer, mostly EU just like it does in the energy sector.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXbU9kRFc1UkpIRjVkb0JETEs5RThQTEcwNkJBMXZzRldMYmVPcmx1LS1naTlDQ0M3aHBJeExrd0VYazRmWlRoMjJyWkF4dHlYM1Y3Q3hBWVhvY056T1E9PQ==

"They, together, are looking forward to and preparing for a Trump victory; while Democrats attack their own leadership and move further away from a Biden's victory while Trump supporters rally notwithstanding his personal shortcomings, lack of character, a pro-Putin stance and anti-NATO and anti-EU position.  

To Putin, Xi and Orban the Democratic party is ready to hand over the next presidency to them and their allies.  Orban ditched Biden and went to visit Trump at Mar a Lago and called his discussions with Trump Peace Mission 5.0 at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. 

This came shortly after his visit with Zelensky followed by Putin and Xi. Trump has never been more confident about his reelection bid; so much so that his wife Melania who had shown zero interest in Trump's reelection and avoided participation in his bid for reelection is now set to join him and appear together at the Republican National Convention.  

That tells me what they think of returning to the White House. They are united and Democrats are fractured. 

Perhaps it is time for Blinken the left-handed guitarist to return to Ukraine with his guitar and sing another song.  

It is time for either the Democratic party to unite behind Biden or say goodbye to Democracy. I think they will opt to say goodbye to Democracy.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYUVRdTFqdC1PUTQ4UDhnTk5Sd0QzZWJiSU1fVGFBLUQyMEZWWVFVanBlVlltVTFoRUhTa2w3R0RIUUZDN2JueVlKbFhZZGlRQTdhYVZ1WmRNQkp2WHc9PQ==
"CEPA, by comparing Putin to the Tsar is secretly hoping Putin will end up like Tsar who was toppled and later murdered along with his entire family. It is not in the cards.  

Putin is considered a hero not only by his own population including those in the annexed territories, but the Global South generally.  They consider him a powerful world leader. There are reasons for it, even as the second is command, he managed to quell the insurrection in Chechnya and the Northern Caucuses. 

His status only grew after the Ukraine war mostly because of his ability to circumvent the unprecedented sanctions as demonstrated by the latest elections.  Foreign leaders can only dream of such results.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWGt4N2RlOThOcld2T0lEck5iUHFBQ3d5RUl1YXBCSExVaG1WajVTSno4d01XZ0pEeVU5bEtoYW9YaEpwT1N4ekl5eWxqZndwVm96SlA4MjNlNUlnb2c9PQ==
"Glad Trump is safe. Trump's first comments after the assassination attempt was a call for the country to unite. His second comment made a reference that we cannot let evil win. Biden spoke to the former president after the attack to wish him a speedy recovery. Biden also made a public comment to Americans: President Biden condemned the shooting at the Trump rally and called on other Americans to do the same. However, he went on to add:  

""The idea that there's political violence or violence in America like this, is just unheard of. It's just not appropriate.""  

He must have forgotten all the way from Abe, to RFK to JFK and attempted assassination of President Regan.  Many other political leaders have been attacked in more recent times, including Gabby Gifford during a rally in Arizona.  

In 2017 James Hodgkinson shot six people, including Steve Scalise and congressional aid Zack Barth among others. Most recently Pelosi's husband barely survived after an attacker went to assassinate Pelosi's husband.  

Obviously, the attempted assassination has generated a tremendous amount of sympathy for the former president and will further unite his party. This event will certainly fuel the Trump rally. He is known to portray himself as a victim and a martyr. Now he has demonstrative evidence that will likely be highlighted during the Republican Convention.

Ultimately, however, whether this moves the needle one way or another in the polls are doubtful, even after the debate debacle and some calling for Biden to step down, it is closely tied, and I think it will continue to be a close race. 

Trump's comment about uniting the country after the shooting was appropriate, but his second comment about ""we cannot let evil win,"" gave me a pause. What evil was he talking about, was it the gunman or the Democratic Party at large or perhaps the January 6, rioters.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNackRsMzBVUkJERG1zSl9VVF9yNXJWLUNMZXUtU1NTZGJYeEtvYlFNZVJzdWFxMUY2OFVCRzFKaXo4QVhNNlA0aFNqaDlNN2stTUpiSEVIS1ZEb2JObVE9PQ==

"Yes, the war is just not fought in the battlefields. However, scare tactics only works where there is a credible capacity to put another in fear of unacceptable loss.  Does Russia have a credible capacity to put European countries where scare capacity is effective \\[without use of nuclear weapons\\]; Certainly. The bigger question and the only issue is whether Russia has capacity to put in fear U.S. itself. Here, U.S. is a bigger power than the U.S. and it has a bigger capacity to scare Russia, but it has to go full bore.   

It is not going to go full bore because US has always been unwavering in its position, it just wants for Ukraine to continue the fight so long as it can. It only wants a proxy battle. Hence, Russia will continue its attrition war.",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhRFIxMGtRRF92cWhJeGRPOVNKcUc2SWphaVZDb003cUtYRWVNX3poSUxMTHJCRnRBM3Q5OEk2S1VzOTV3UVB6X2FQTk9ITUpURk5Pckd1QVBGZUpjOEE9PQ==
"Trump just picked J.D. Vance as his V.P. He is another isolationist when it comes to foreign interventions. He focuses on populism and economics. 

Trump and Vance did not always admire each other. Around early 2016 when Trump was running for his first term, he called him an idiot and considered him reprehensible. According to Reuters, he privately compared him to Adolf Hitler. How things changed. 

Like Trump, he will now be focused on border issues and deportations by the masses. He is not expected to support continued aid or support for Ukraine either.  American First is his motto and he is going to be just like Trump, if Trump wins again and should Vance someday run as a president; Expect the continuing legacy of Trump.  

It is not looking good for Ukraine, but so long as Biden is still in the running, not all hope is lost for EU at large or the Ukranian conflict.  At least the old guard will continue to provide some minimum support and keep parts of Ukraine as a sovereign. 

He is also against abortions and his goal is to increase birth rate, however, Trump's claims that he is for some degree of choices \\[believe it or not, he will just let the states do his job for him or alternatively the courts\\].",r/geopolitics2,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhNWhncnR1MllObTEwczc3RVhvTk1jWE5kZ0NtZUZsaHR1bG5wazZWTjZUajdZenF2T3g1WEZ0R0lpeG42Q0l3VXN6eHZrdDNEYWRZb3M3WlJuRUYzQUE9PQ==
