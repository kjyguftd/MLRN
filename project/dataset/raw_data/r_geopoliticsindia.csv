">East Asia is still very traditional despite being economic powerhouses. Koreans won’t even offer you water if you ain’t a Korean, same for the Japanese.

This is true on a surface level but in many aspects cultural liberalism has also affected them as well

I think India should have more major world players backed by the Indian government.

Oh yes I definitely agree we need more big players 
That's essentially how a country industrialises to a huge extent 

Even recently adani buying ports in Israel or some other nearby countries all helps us 

These companies do have government backing as well no doubt & so do other major corporations like Boeing

"Hey man, I'm staunchly pro-Israel to the point where I want Israel to annex the Golan Heights, West Bank, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula and kick all of the Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt. So you won't catch me dead defending anything the Palestinians or Hamas do.

But I said what I said because of the amount of pressure on India to conform to international opinion on each conflict. The world sees Palestinians as an extremely oppressed group of people who are stuck in that 40-km long strip of land who have nowhere else to go and are getting bombed by a much superior force which is backed by the most powerful military in the world. And they see Hamas as a ""resistance group"" defending these oppressed people. So the optics are much worse there, than in Ukraine which is a large country with a professional military that is also backed by the most powerful military in the world.

">“I respect that India likes its strategic autonomy. But in times of conflict there is no such thing as strategic autonomy. We will in crisis moments need to know each other and need to know that we are trusted friends, brothers and sisters, colleagues in times of need in the next day can be acting together,” said Eric Garcetti, the US Ambassador to India Thursday at the CUTS Defence Conclave.

>The US Ambassador to India added, “Do not take this relationship for granted. Enjoy every day of it, pay something into it…Let’s make sure that we look at each other not as a bet. Neither of us is a bride or a groom to be wooed or everyone’s friend at the party, but a strong set of powers.”

This is an eminently sensible and respectful way to convey a disagreement. I don't understand why people are up in arms over it.

As I see it, India needs the US more than they need us. Russia will not go counter to China's interests in the almost certain event of a conflict with China. The US *can* go it alone with Europe and Japan against China without India's help. 

In the long run, as ordinary citizens, we have vastly more to gain from aligning with the Western set of liberal democratic values than with the toxic dystopian vision of humanity that China, Russia, or (god forbid) the Islamic world represents. The Western (especially American) model is not perfect, but it has provisions built in to critically analyze its own flaws through civil discourse. Their values are not arbitrary contraptions to rationalize the hold of despot-du-jour on power. They are instead evolved through a process of vigorous debate and analysis on what factors contribute to human flourishing and happiness.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYUGZmNU03LUpiVWVLRU5ZM2dUSmpWaF9xaXVESHVtSV9rQ1ZzbVF3dEwxdWY0VFRxMnFEOWlUb2VLNmo3TjFqeG1RalJQRjNuVWljSjhXYkxWZEdvYUE9PQ==

"Don't worry, I'm not accusing you of anything or trying to attack you. I'm just trying to have a discussion since whenever I have asked this question here I haven't got a proper or coherent response before. You are one of the first people to try and address my question properly. 

Regarding your second paragraph, Hamas started this war when they massacred over a 1000 Israeli civilians in a brutal terrorist attack. I don't get why that doesn't count for anything? Particularly in the global south, which has refused to condemn the October 7th attacks for the most part. In fact, I think India is one of the few countries in the global south to even condemn what Hamas did. Its not related to my initial question, but I was just curious why this is the case?

Also, in terms of international opinion, if we take the UN as an indicator (because I'm not sure what else we can use) the vast majority of countries in the general assembly have routinely voted in favour of resolutions calling for an end to the Russia Ukraine war. In fact, up to 141 countries voted in favour of the very first resolution on this matter, which was only slightly less than the number of countries that voted in favour of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. In other words, that looks pretty overwhelming to me:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_Nations\\_General\\_Assembly\\_Resolution\\_ES-11/1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_ES-11/1)

"SS: In a major breakthrough, a team of Indian scientists has created a user-friendly way to generate unpredictable random numbers crucial for stronger quantum data encryption and provide robust cybersecurity, the Ministry of Science & Technology has said.
Quantum cryptography, also known as quantum encryption, refers to various cybersecurity methods for encrypting and transmitting secure data based on the naturally occurring and immutable laws of quantum mechanics.
The Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, which is an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), performed a photonic experiment to demonstrate a violation of what is called the Leggett Garg Inequalities (LGI) -- a litmus test for ""quantumness"" in a system in a loophole-free manner.
The team carried out extensive research in collaboration with researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, IISER-Thiruvananthapuram and the Bose Institute, Kolkata to use such LGI violation in a completely unexplored domain -- truly unpredictable random number generation, secure against device tampering and imperfections.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdHNfb0gyY1RVZktPaGpHUmxrMEZ1YndWUUNUWlJwbkRvRmxOM0hGM0FOVnFKbS1WSVdXSkxhRHF0Q09DZlBHUUZ1aFI4M0RtWFpkdXM1anJGbDNrb1hUd3owTDFBX2FPUDM1UHB2cFI1UkU9

📣 **[Submission Statement by OP](/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1e2cr12/indian_scientists_make_major_breakthrough_in/ld0092w/)**:
> SS: In a major breakthrough, a team of Indian scientists has created a user-friendly way to generate unpredictable random numbers crucial for stronger quantum data encryption and provide robust cybersecurity, the Ministry of Science & Technology has said.
>
>Quantum cryptography, also known as quantum encryption, refers to various cybersecurity methods for encrypting and transmitting secure data based on the naturally occurring and immutable laws of quantum mechanics.
>
>The Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, which is an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), performed a photonic experiment to demonstrate a violation of what is called the Leggett Garg Inequalities (LGI) -- a litmus test for ""quantumness"" in a system in a loophole-free manner.
>
>The team carried out extensive research in collaboration with researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, IISER-Thiruvananthapuram and the Bose Institute, Kolkata to use such LGI violation in a completely unexplored domain -- truly unpredictable random number generation, secure against device tampering and imperfections.

"What’s there to be ashamed about lol? I’m happy India is pursuing its own interests and asserting its autonomy. This war has nothing to do with India outside of oil, which Europe also benefits from (but I’m sure you’re going to ignore that fact), so why should India hold any responsibility for what happens? Russia, not India, is doing the land-grabbing and the killing, which India has been on the receiving end of for several decades by its two hostile neighbors (but nobody cared then). 

Do you think the US and UK felt ashamed when Pakistan started several wars against India? No. In fact, they supplied and continue to supply weapons (along with loans) to Pakistan (how do you think Pakistan accumulated F-16 fighter jets?) so they can continue to make profits and “put a check on India”. It was Russia that supplied us with weapons and equipment to defend ourselves. Speaking on Ukraine specifically, Ukraine was part of the countries that opposed India’s nuclear program (you know, the thing that countries want so as to defend themselves against hostile countries). Ukraine has never done anything good for India, and has even opposed India’s interests, so why then should India suddenly start feeling “generous” towards Ukraine? India then got sanctioned for nuclear tests, because apparently, India’s desire to protect itself through deterrence is treated as a joke by Western nations. 

All this, and you expect Indians to sacrifice India’s defense equipment and oil supplies from Russia for the US’s bloc, which has historically opposed India’s interests?

If citizens in these nations don’t feel ashamed and responsible for all the Indian lives that have been lost because of their decades-long relationship with their “major non-NATO ally”/Taliban-training partner Pakistan, why do you think Indians should feel “ashamed” about Ukrainians being killed by Russians? ",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZdXBrLU14M3Z2SVJoWUExbTAxclhJd0t2X1o1cUdhdWJMR2F6d0ZrSkdDbnVaLUZYUzV3dElrYnBtNDNPcm9wbXc2eGpQc1VudW4tSFJPUTg5Z0l6Umc9PQ==

"1. Even more fun fact, this paper shows the US has been the primary exporter of weapons such as F-16s. 

[https://www.stimson.org/2023/25-years-of-security-cooperation-beneath-the-nuclear-shadow/](https://www.stimson.org/2023/25-years-of-security-cooperation-beneath-the-nuclear-shadow/)

Meanwhile, Russia has been the dominant supplier of India's critical weaponry.

""Approximately, 85% of India’s major weapons are of [Russian origin](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2473328/the-influence-of-arms-explaining-the-durability-of-indiarussia-alignment/), including critical technologies such as the co-produced BrahMos missiles, SSBNs, Su-30 aircraft, and S-400 missile systems.""

India also sends artillery shells to Ukraine, which obviously goes against Russia's interests. India will export wherever it can. I don't expect Russia to be subservient to India's interests, just like I don't expect India to be subservient to Russia's interests. Both countries are seizing opportunities where they can, and these minuscule weapons supplies from both countries don't negate the critical weaponry that has been developed because of Russia's cooperation with India. The weapons listed in this article have been crucial to India's defense, and the US spent several decades denying tech transfers and joint weapons development while also arming up Pakistan. India is obviously not going to throw out legacy ties with Russia for a historically hostile nation like the US. 



2. Going on to more fun facts, during the 1971 Indo-Pak War, the US sent a navy fleet into the Bay of Bengal to threaten India, and it was Russia that showed up with its own fleet to deter the US from encouraging Pakistan to continue its invasion into India and genociding the Bengali Muslims. Threatening to annihilate India, whether you were going to actually do it or not, leaves a bad impression on India. 

Another fun fact, after Pakistan violated a peace agreement that it made with India in 1999 and crossed into India's territory (yet again), the US was more than happy to jam India's GPS, leading to more Indians losing their lives trying to defend their territory against a hostile invader. 

[https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2021/april/regaining-gps-strategic-advantage](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2021/april/regaining-gps-strategic-advantage)

""The United States used selective availability to degrade GPS accuracy to Indian military forces during the 1999 Kargil War, which hindered Indian operations. This incident highlighted the advantages afforded to forces using GPS, as well as the disadvantages to those without. The U.S. action led India, and others, to develop their own systems.""



3. Going on to more fun facts about India and Russian ties, India's space program was sanctioned from 1992-2011 by the US because the US didn't want Russia to give its cryogenic engine technology to India, leading to India having to develop its own engines and hindering India's space ambitions. Russia's actions would have benefitted India's tech sector greatly.



4. Speaking of sanctions, India, with its huge population, requires oil to keep its economy going since it is not blessed with significant natural oil deposits. India has greatly benefitted from Russia's exports of oil (so has Europe, but you're definitely going to ignore that inconvenient tidbit), especially since in 2018, Trump imposed sanctions on getting oil from Iran, a country that India has good relations with and would help India access Central Asia without having to go through Pakistan



India has very good reasons not to sever ties with Russia and very very good reasons not to trust the US. I am under no illusion that Russia does not genuinely care about India's interests (not like the US does either). However, Russia has been a strategic ally and has helped promote India's interests.

"India can act selfishly. As a population we can choose to be good or evil or pretty shitty to other people. And others are allowed to judge us for that, we can choose to ignore or introspect based on these judgements.

But we don’t get to pat ourselves on the back when we don’t do good or profit of the tragedy of others. I don’t know why the USA is used as a benchmark here for judging India’s actions or is the basis of your entire argument. That is exactly what is broken about the USA, another 100 years, their post WW2 hegemony will fade out, then the ones who can lead are the ones whom others will trust to support them and not exploit them.

In a country where every uncle spews morality and culture and higher principles, it’s ironic to see how fast we justify letting others suffer for short term profits.

"I really don't think so India is going against the West with this whole Russia angle. Isn't India basically acting like a middleman for Russian oil exports to the West?

I think this is all just theatrics that the West is involved in to show the world they are against war/oppression (unless they are the ones who do it then it is A-Okay) otherwise we would have started seeing trade blocks by now. 

The entire world is blaming the West for its Israeli support and just a few months back US government-backed Boeing was straight up assassinating American citizens for being whistleblowers. The thing you folks need to understand is that the US isn't the hegemony like it was in the 1900's, China will most probably become a larger power than the US in our lifetimes so we need to focus on maintaining power in Asia and not giving a fuck about what the West thinks now.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUkJmSXdyaFhGamxyLXNiNm1zemp0TmNYZE9IbW1Ba2FZTkRHMjJXOTAyZ2plYk1CSkF3VXVaTm1iOVdSTF9FRmI4eEs4aS1wN0RtWmhMQTlsUXZUTnc9PQ==

"LOL, what a fantasy, Indian missiles range is more than capable of reaching Beijing . India has MIRV missile to boot.

It's extremely difficult to shoot down ICBM. ICBM Missile just don't travel from india to eastern China then to Beijing. The first are launched to space and then they re-enter as multiple war heads at more than mach 20 speed , that is much faster than the fastest hypersonic missile speed they have. Even if they somehow shoot down a few, there will be multiple redundant warheads that will be used, factoring in few of them won't make it.

And Chinese population unlike other countries is extremely  concentrated in east cost around few cities, all it take is few successful war heads to wipe out entire chinese population . The ones who survive in the villages, will not make it through the nuclear winter that follows.

">I knew you would bring up the Bangladeshi war, because most of you are still obsessed over it.

1. I literally gave examples of the US's hostile actions to India even after 1971, like the Kargil War in 1999, the weapons transfers to Pakistan in the 2000s, and the sanctioning of Russian tech transfers to India's space program. There's also the sanctioning of India's nuclear program, which again, is crucial to India's defense. It's why China's land-grabbing of India is confined to sticks and stones, and not a full-scale invasion. After all this, Pakistan is still listed as a major non-NATO ally and a ""strategic hedge"" against India. Pakistan continues to remain a threat, helped by getting multiple loans and weapons transfers for its ~~military~~ sorry, I mean """"""economic development"""""". Funny how with the dozens of loans Pakistan receives, Pakistan continues to conduct terror attacks against Indians (like the Kathua Terror attack a few days ago and the Reasi Terror attack a month ago) and crackdowns on anyone who isn't a Punjabi Sunni Muslim (like Ahmadi Muslims or Baloch settlers). I'm sure this ""final loan"" will lead to Pakistan's liberalization from a military dictatorship built on persecution and genocide /s. 

[https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3270350/pakistan-pledges-us7-billion-imf-aid-deal-will-be-its-last](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3270350/pakistan-pledges-us7-billion-imf-aid-deal-will-be-its-last)

Want something more into the 2000s? How about the US not extraditing David Headley to India, a DEA agent who orchestrated the 26/11 attacks, because he's a ""US Citizen""? Why does India not have the right to imprison and interrogate Headley? Is the US scared that Headley will reveal the network of US assets that made this devastating attack possible (after all, Pakistan and the US collaborated on the Taliban training and funding project)? I don't care that he's being ~~sheltered~~ , sorry, I mean """"""imprisoned"""""" by the US, India has a right to extradite a terrorist who committed a devastating attack on India and how he conducted those attacks. This is disrespectful to all those Indians who lost their lives and India's right to defend itself.

And no, I refuse to ""stop obsessing"" over the 1971 war. My grandparents and parents lived through that trauma along with many older-generation Indians. I got to experience my childhood hearing about the outbreak of the Kargil War during the summer of 1999 on the news. I also got to hear about the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008. To this day, I still see news about Pakistan's latest terror attacks. You don't tell WW2 survivors to ""move on"" from WW2. But even if I move past your remarkably insensitive comment, the 1971 war continues to be very relevant to India's relationship with the US and Pakistan. This is literally the war whose aftermath inspired Pakistan's ""Bleed India With a Thousand Cuts"" doctrine, leading to Pakistan's transition to using terror attacks as its primary method of making life hell for Indians to this day (and I earlier gave you examples of terror attacks from just this past month). The US refused to rein in Pakistan after the war and instead continued to give unabashed support to Pakistan. 

And do you genuinely not find it hilarious that a poor nation on the verge of economic and societal collapse also conveniently has a (relatively) advanced military? Or that it still gets loans despite all the horrific things Pakistan's military rulers have done? It's almost as if all these loans to Pakistan go to its continued military build-up and vast terror network. If the US actually forced Pakistan to follow through with restructuring its economy under conditional loans, Pakistan wouldn't be the basket case (with nukes) that it is today. It seems like the US likes Pakistan being ruled by a military dictatorship with a continued warlike stance towards India. After all, gotta keep a check on the world's largest democracy which has never initiated any conflict since its founding by rubber-stamping loans to a genocidal dictatorship, right? 

>  
News flash: the soviet union is dead and the modern Russian state is essentially an economic colony of China (from sanctions busting to chief crude importer).

2. I gave examples of how Russia has helped India, well past 1989. Again, a lot of India's critical weaponry such as Brahmos is possible because of joint development programs with Russia into the 2000s. Russia also maintains ties with India because it doesn't want to solely rely on China. China also doesn't want Russia to become another North Korea whereby NK's crazy actions cause scrutiny on China due to China's direct ties with NK. Having Russia as a ""close but not close enough"" ally ensures China avoids more scrutiny. Russia still supplies discounted oil that benefits India. Meanwhile, the US continues to threaten sanctions against India, knowing full well that India needs it and Europe buys that oil. 

>  
It's military now relies on great wall motors for its SUVs

3. And that's precisely why India is gradually phasing out its dependence on Russia and trying to work with other nations such as France and Israel. However, India will not abandon Russia (which would then bring Russia much closer to China) if it can still reap benefits. This is how most nations operate, yet somehow, it's only India's (justified) reliance on Russia that gets put in the spotlight. 

India will do what's best for India. Case closed.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZOFVkYkNiS0hMaVZqSXVFVTZlZUc5QWxudjVqS1Y3alJaeWdXOHBUNFZMcVRHdHdRWktqWl9pbHZxekU0ZU1Pb1RlSVBNblNCUTJqZ2xKdUhnNVJJZXc9PQ==

"I would like to add that Pakistan has only ever been sanctioned by the US for possessing and testing its nukes (just as India has). Pakistan never faced the fallout for hosting Bin Laden (like how Afghanistan got invaded because they did the exact same thing earlier), Pakistan never gets sanctioned for hosting terror groups like Iran does (but I guess the Paki terror groups tend to be mainly confined to attacking Indians, so that's okay with Americans, and some of them, like David Headley, are former US agents). Has Pakistan ever been sanctioned for its horrific genociding of its minorities? Once again...no. So, to conclude, the light wrist slaps that Pakistan gets, along with its continued weapons transfers and loan transfers make it really hard for India to trust the US. Don't try and pretend that Pakistan isn't treated as a strategic US asset even to this day.

"It is for the best that Tesla is not looking at investing in India as a high priority. Tesla’s are expensive and at the current design and price of a base Tesla model, India is unlikely to be the big market it thinks it is. Second, India as an export base is not a good idea. For example, exports of cars from India to Thailand is 15% tariffs but 0% for exports from Vietnam. India  has no free trade agreements and is a big disadvantage to use India as a base for exports. Second due to one of the highest tariffs in India, imports of components for manufacturing result in higher cost of products and it is difficult to export to other countries. India needs market reforms starting with lowering tariffs, forcing Indian manufacturers to become more competitive. 

How can that be done? Make land acquiring more efficient. Introduce labor reforms. Reduce the regulatory burden on manufacturing. Reduce tariffs to SE Asia levels. Make free trade agreements. Investment will flow in when investors see they can get a return on their investment. Vietnam ids doing that now. For now TATA’s should continue to expand EV manufacturing in India. Their cost of the product is very competitive. If they faced the same duties as Vietnam they too could export their EVs globally.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZa0xReGZPUzY0MzRpR3cxbldmXzdBWnpwVGJUeGczUmthLTdKUXI4YUNXY2hhREFSN1hGWW5FellRcXRsUFJZZFdkQXp5Z0lnajg4b2I2ckJfOVBYNmc9PQ==

"I am sorry but China got FDI inflows of $163bn in 2023 which is more than twice of that of India. And almost 25% of Indian FDI came from Mauritius. We all know what that means. China is a middle income country already so are not dependent on FDI as much as India does. 

Secondly, the only leverage Tesla got was to set up a fully owned subsidiary in China without partnering with a local car maker. I dont think there are any ongoing privileges that Tesla gets especially when Chinese EV and battery makers themselves are so good and competitive now. Have you even look at or realise how competitive Chinese car market is and how huge it is?

India is a tiny unconsequential market for anything which is not dirt cheap. As an example, BMW sold 820,000 cars in China in the year 2023, in India, a mere 14,172 cars! Or in other words, China buys more BMW's in a month than BMW would sell in India in 5 years.

"In 2021 China had FDI of 344 billion and now it’s 163 billion with western countries not keen on investment in China. When you compare FDI as a percentage of GDP it’s not even close. 

I do agree with you on a good portion of India’s FDI being round tripping of investments to dodge taxes but even taking that into account India’s FDI is impressive when interest rates are high in the west. It’s highly likely India will go past 100 billion  in FDI during NDA’s third term and I can see China go below 100 billion. China is a middle income country but I would say it’s more like India where people either make it or they don’t. 

Not sure if you were able to read the article since it was behind a paywall but after the visit China has let Tesla implement its self driving technology in China now. That service will be more lucrative than selling cars in the long run. Yes China EV industry is competitive and that’s why Tesla’s growth has leveled off but that does not mean Tesla’s brand has dropped. 

India has large tariffs and GST on cars which makes luxury cars not viable towards the middle class and BMW does has not released a car for the Indian market. India as an auto market is over 4 million cars and it should probably double over the next 10-15 years as people move from rural areas and into urban areas. 

I would not say India only has a market for cheap products since iPhones are not cheap and people in India are buying a lot of them. India is developing at a fast pace its consumer market will explode over the next 20-25 years regardless of which political party is in power.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWGNPTkc4Y0JobUdFNUdFUGJFY2dLdl8wUk9zdEtFYnRqSkk0eEdXNk8wZGcwQjNIOGtUcFAzdGtRQnFsWGVJbHNyRU8yb0QxaTNNU01xRG5OTW5laW05V2ZIa0NwZG42RTNfa3R1SkNNbW89
">This is an eminently sensible and respectful way to convey a disagreement.

This is such a hilariously bad take.

>As I see it, India needs the US more than they need us. Russia will not go counter to China's interests in the almost certain event of a conflict with China. The US *can* go it alone with Europe and Japan against China without India's help.

So why don't they? Europe is not as closely aligned with US against China as you seem to believe. As per this [article](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-08/donald-trump-china-nato-chinese-aggression), according to a survey by Institute for Global Affairs in the U.S., U.K., Germany and France — four of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s wealthiest countries — Europeans proved far less inclined than Americans to view China as a threat, to hold strongly negative opinions of it or to believe the West should gear up for a new Cold War. Along with it, the cost of logistics and sustaining bases in Pacific will be humongous. 

You realize what this means, right? They need India as much as India needs them. 

>In the long run, as ordinary citizens, we have vastly more to gain from aligning with the Western set of liberal democratic values than with the toxic dystopian vision of humanity that China, Russia, or (god forbid) the Islamic world represents.

Where's the logic? India’s democratic values are intrinsic and they don't hinge on how aligned we are geopolitically with the Western powers. US itself supported Pakistan during Bangladesh war in 1971, despite Pakistan being a military dictatorship. Its arms sales to Suadis contributed to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. If US aligning with Pakistan back in the day that was actively committing a genocide, didn't change its democratic, I don't see how our lack of alignment with US changes our character. Our political make-up is governed by Indian constitution and as long as it's in place, India will remain democratic irrespective of our geopolitical alignment. 

>The Western (especially American) model is not perfect, but it has provisions built in to critically analyze its own flaws through civil discourse. Their values are not arbitrary contraptions to rationalize the hold of despot-du-jour on power. They are instead evolved through a process of vigorous debate and analysis on what factors contribute to human flourishing and happiness.

"With the interest rates high the western companies arent investing anywhere. Also more than a quarter of our so called FDI came out of countries like Mauritius. Do I need to join the dots for you to realise whats happening? If they are like India, as you say, where people either make it or they don’t, how are they such a large consumer market? Stop fooling yourself.

Not sure what you mean by ""implementing self drive technology"" but they have allowed Tesla to test their FSD in China just like other Chinese auto makers. Tesla has many more things other than cars which they sell around the world in whatever market will buy that stuff. There is nothing special that China does except for being a really big consumer market.

Yes India has ridiculous amount of taxes on cars but that is not a Tesla or another car maker's problem. All they care about it how much they earn after selling a car in the country. What do you mean BMW has not released a car for India? They sell all of their international model range in India. Or are you waiting for BMW to release a car priced the same as a Suzuki Swift so that they can do volumes - you are stupider than I thought you were. Let me break another bubble for you - China buys more BMW's than Maruti sells Swift in India - multiple times over. The so called 4 million cars is mostly comprised of cheap and cheerful cars - death traps like Alto, Swift or Baleno's or cheap Hyundai's.

India is a tiny market even for Apple. There is a reason why they only have two official Apple stores in India, a country of 1.4bn people when they have more than 5 in a city  like Melbourne alone. In revenue terms, Australia does more revenue for Apple than India does and they have a population less than that of New Delhi.

India is developing fast for people who already have an obscene amount of money. Tell me what innovative product or technology has Ambani invented to becomes the wealthiest man in Asia or Adani? They are in glorified commodity businesses which have no future anywhere outside India but in India, if you have government in your pocket, you can do as you please. Some other stats to burst your bubble - in India if you earn 25k a month or approx $300 a month, you are in the top 10% of the population. More than 600mn people live on less than $1.5 a day. 800mn people are depedent on govt handouts for their daily sustenance.

And how will we develop - look at the number of patents filed per country, China is number one. Look at the number research publications from top universities, China has a lot in the top 20, there is not one from India in top 100! Look at their spend on R&D or education.

IAF has badly fallen from the required 42 squadrons..with Mig 21 being retired...even more so. The current 32 squadrons will not be effective at all. I'm sure China has like 100+.

India badly needs to ramp up Tejas MK1 production to 200-250 per year. 

It's laughable because the current rate of 24-25 per annum is no good to anyone. 

And it needs a proper engine deal...with 100pc ToT. Heard Rolls Royce is interested in this. It also needs to set up a dedicated engine factory in a place like Nagpur or Hyderabad. Somewhere near the central maintenance command.

">Regarding your second paragraph, Hamas started this war when they massacred over a 1000 Israeli civilians in a brutal terrorist attack. I don't get why that doesn't count for anything? Particularly in the global south, which has refused to condemn the October 7th attacks for the most part. In fact, I think India is one of the few countries in the global south to even condemn what Hamas did. Its not related to my initial question, but I was just curious why this is the case?

A lot of countries in the global south are either Muslim, or are under the sphere of influence of Qatar, Iran or Russia.

Qatar is also trying to infiltrate into the US:

>I just wonder why India doesn't have this same conviction with regards to resolutions on Gaza. Is it really just because of the 8 million Indians that live in the Gulf countries and oil?

It has to do with the optics that I had described above, which are much worse in Gaza than Ukraine, and our relationship with the Gulf countries too.

"I am the child of Indian immigrants and this is my take about the negatives of the diaspora in Canada. **To be clear I am not saying most Indian people are bad I am saying of the bad that exist things these are issues you see.**

1. My parents are Punjabi Jatts and the people emigrating to Canada en masse are Punjabi/Haryana Jatts/Jaats and such people have a **redneck culture**. [African Americans and rural White Southerns ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdoLjah3IWA&ab_channel=LibertyPen)also have a redneck culture as well which is why they get criticized a lot in America. So Indians in Canada get criticized for a similar behaviors. An example are people who hang out in giant crowds and think it gives them license to do [whatever they want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqWZcRf1CWU&ab_channel=TheTribune). Also many people think khalistan is Sikh extremism but it is better described as jatt sikh extremism that has been exported into Canada since the 1980s. Also the government is enmeshed with khalistani people because khalistani gurudwaras are vote bank, not in the federal election but in behind the scenes politics of choosing the party leader, candidates, fundraising for the party etc.
2. There is as stereotype that Gujarati people are cheap / good with money and thus are good at balancing the books of the business they run (eg motels in America). But the most extreme iteration of this is are videos about how to get free food from a food bank dedicated for the poor (like this screenshot of this vid by [Mr Patel](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaHousing2/comments/15xlmh7/indian_student_in_canada_explaining_how_take/)). Although I will say Indians from other states have made these sort of vids but the two guys who got backlash were Gujarati.
3. I studied at a legit university (sad I have to say that in the first place...) and the Indian students I met came from all around India and the Gulf + Kenya. And they mostly came from tier 1 and tier 2 cities. While the students who are from rural Punjab and rural Gujarat tend to go to no name schools that no one knows about and almost live in a parallel reality from other people. I even saw a post by a guy who came to Canada to improve his English but winded up teaching the [teacher Hindi](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/11ltp4u/indian_students_abroad_expectations_vs_reality/)... Students at these schools think they qualify for PR but that is totally misleading unless they file a fake refugee claim.

Now finally to be clear I would say most my interactions with Indian immigrants (including Punjabi and Gujarati people) are good so I am not saying Indians are bad I am just explaining the bad side of things.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZc0lPT05sUVA5a1lGYjFzS1ItN09NNWVzTlViWlE4bVFOcDZqQXEtWXAzcDYycDNBRjhmYks3NVFHM0NTZTBmUGdqdDhlRXplcFA3d1lQUUxleFJfd2c9PQ==

Except, this will do the exact opposite. Driving up recruitment to their ideologies and instigate fellow sympathizers to carry out deplorable acts elsewhere.

Remember we too have a significant Jewish, let alone Hindu (obviously) populace. Which means, as state entities, we should be careful with instigating said radicals with over-the-support, especially on the internet, to everything Israel does. 'Arms length and support to arms' way as I like to call it. Although we have done a surprisingly good job maintain good relations with actors from both sides. We absolutely cannot afford those...elements to spill over on home-soil.

"The original F16 sale happened under Reagan when India was deep in the throes of it's Soviet alliance. Even then Reagan extracted a LOT from Pakistan before selling it to them. Reagan and Carter did it because at the time, the USSR was helping its commie friends in Afghanistan who had overthrown the emir and Pakistan was a willing bulwark against this. We all know how that worked out when the ISI trained the mujahideen...
   
Even worse is that China actively colluded with Pakistan to let them develop nuclear technology up until 1992 when they signed the NPT.

"1. Who is we? I dont care about what you scream about in your little chat groups  
2. Pakistan became an MNNA in 2004, while your article is set in the 80s. These are different time periods.  
3. Pakistan, like India, receives weapons that they pay for. Unless you're talking about a different framework for Pakistan where they don't receive weapons or the companies doing business with them lose India as a client, which India can effect (which I've commented also [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1dha7n8/close_ally_japan_set_to_sanction_indian_firms_for/l8votra/?context=3) and slightly different [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1djcw27/discussion_thread/l9add0k/?context=3)). Yes, India should absolutely make corporations bend to its will. Let Pakistan use second hand weapons. Sanction every supplier who sells to Pakistan. There's nothing even China can do to retaliate. Scuttle their defense industry completely.   
3. You having respect or disrespect for westerners isn't a geopolitical discussion, its the subject of a chatroom discussion. The geopolitical aspect here is how and where does India benefit more, clear and simple. 99 times out of 100, India wins if it aligns with the west. I can't think of one OECD country that is also West aligned that is ""poor"". I have several examples of maverick countries (like Egypt) that remain unstable. ICYMI, India still has a lot of poor people. Everyones only focus should be chucking them out of poverty into a ~$11,000 nominal per capita income country. 
  
The 2019-2023 period even started discussions of friendshoring, which is *exactly* what we need. We need people to use our glut of labour and set up all kinds of manufacturing here. That should be out only focus. We should be a ""friend"" and we should make money. Anything else is too early or too unnecessary. Possibly the concept of ""bide your time"" is lost in this impatient country. 
  
Russia is incompetent and a mafia state. China is never going to see us eye to eye. The only option left is the West or like, nothing economies in Latin America and Africa.

"1. MNNA status: Obviously? All MNNA status gives is exceptions to the Arms Export Control Act without needing the approval of the US President. India has been given another nomenclature: Major Defense PArtner, because our foreign ministry doesn't like the word ""ally"". So I dont understand what your point is. India *doesnt* want to be called an ally and you say Pakistan shouldn't be an ally? I'm curious what say you think we have in the matter.  
  
2. > SEATO is generally considered a failure because internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military    
What is the point of this? Virtually everyone knows SEATO and CENTO were failures.  
  
3. > F-16 sustainment package to Pakistan  
  
[Here's what the package has](https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/pakistan-f-16-case-sustainment). It's like our [C-17 sustainment program](https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/india-c-17-sustainment-follow-support).   
  
Should the US continue to do it? If we're getting into the normativeness of all of it, then no, I don't think the US should do it. I think India should make a play for it. The defense market is an oligopsony or something close to a monopsony. There are plenty of sellers, very few buyers (big ticket buyers: India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar). Sellers and buyers have almost equal leverage here. We should ask Lockheed to go pound sand if they don't cut this shit out.  
   
Finally, outlier? Yes, the outlier you're talking about is the Cold War.  
   
The US has had multiple combat engagements with China (Korean War, Tibetan War, the various Straits of Taiwan engagements). None of this stopped them from still persisting with China and forcing them into the WTO. Now that they've sown, they're reaping the rewards of their hamfisted anti-Soviet brainworms.  
  
So yes, the outlier is the detente between the US and China, not the support *from* the US *to* India (as you implied).

Okay, and no amount of doing whatever you think is the opposite of simping is changing hard and fast reality: India has since LEMOA/COMCASA/ISA/GSOMIA and a host of other agreements with the US, as well as being invited to Project Artemis and allowing SpaceX to be here (we don't even allow sat phones or regular non-AIR news on commercial radio, so this is huge). All Western economies put together have oodles and oodles of cash. I want cash. I want India to have cash. Whether we partner up with an incompetent KGB buffoon or we partner up with highly energized and well capitalized economies shouldn't even be up for debate.

"Maybe you need to learn a little more about history. 


> The myth of the Chinese betrayal of India during the border disputes between the two countries is still prevalent despite evidence suggesting a more complex situation. The border dispute in the Western Sector (Aksai Chin) stemmed from India unilaterally changing its official maps in 1954. In the Eastern Sector, the dispute arose from China's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the McMahon Line. Diplomatic miscommunication and suspicion characterized the interactions between India and China. In 1960, China proposed a 'package deal' to resolve the border dispute, but India maintained an inflexible approach. India's Forward Policy sought to establish outposts in the disputed territory, which resulted in increased tensions. Clashes between Indian and Chinese troops eventually escalated into a full-scale conflict, known as the Sino-Indian War of 1962. After several failed ceasefire attempts, China eventually declared a unilateral ceasefire, and both sides withdrew their forces. The Sino-Indian border dispute was not a simple case of Chinese betrayal. Instead, it was a complex situation arising from historically ambiguous borders, miscommunication, and diplomatic failures. While China's invasion of India cannot be justified under international law, it's essential to acknowledge the nuances of the situation rather than blaming either side exclusively.

"On the other hand:

The CIA interventions in Netherlands is what allowed the top nuclear scientist of Pakistan to escape with stolen Dutch uranium enrichment centrifuge tech.

This tech was not only used to make Pakistan's nukes but was also sold to Libya , Iran (that's the centrifuges y'all keep hearing about) and North Korea
for those who doubt the CIA involvement:-

Former Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers revealed in 2005 that Dutch authorities wanted to arrest Khan in 1975 and again in 1986 but that on each occasion the Central Intelligence Agency advised against taking such action. According to Lubbers, the CIA conveyed the message: ""Give us all the information, but don't arrest him.""
https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Why-the-U.S.-let-Pakistan-nuclear-scientist-A.Q.-Khan-off-the-hook
for those wondering why the US helped Pakistan in the largest nuclear proliferation operation ever?
well, you see arming Islamists to fight Soviets in Afghanistan was so important that nuclear proliferation Just had to be done
""While the Reagan administration was concerned about nuclear proliferation, it gave a greater priority to securing aid to Pakistan so it could support the Afghan anti-Soviet insurgency.""
For the sake of that aid, senior Reagan administration officials gave Pakistan much slack by obscuring its nuclear activities
While top CIA officials warned that the Pakistanis were likely to share the technology with China, Secretary of State George Shultz and other officials believed, ironically, that denying Pakistani requests would make that country less responsive to U.S. nonproliferation goals.
in December 1982 Secretary of State Shultz warned President Reagan of the “overwhelming evidence that Zia has been breaking his assurances.” He also expressed concern that Pakistan would make sensitive nuclear technology available to “unstable Arab countries.”
In June 1986 ACDA director Kenneth Adelman wrote that Zia has “lied to us again"" about violations of agreements not to produce highly-enriched uranium above a five-percent level.
Until 1990, after the Soviets had left Afghanistan, Washington never allowed events to reach a point where public controversy over Pakistani nuclear weapons activities could force a decision to cut off aid and threaten Pakistan’s role as a go—between to the Afghan resistance.
In July 1987 U.S. Customs officials arrested Arshad Pervez for trying to buy supplies for the Kahuta enrichment plant. Nevertheless, the administration insisted that nothing was amiss, arguing that it was too early to conclude the Pervez had official support in Pakistan.[2] Even after Pervez was convicted later that year, Reagan certified again that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device, thereby ensuring that aid flowed without interruption.

"Bro you dont get it.

The US, by way of its tech controls the narrative. Thats way more than just ""deleting tweets"", Its information warfare at its best. There is no bigger power in the world that controlling the narrative. Today elections in India are fought on narratives, narrative for the right vs that of the left. What bot accounts post, what their algorithm chooses to boost, and what is eventually shown to a lot of people vs what is supressed. A simple very recent example, meta boosted ""stand with rafah"" posts on instagarm, but when the Indian right made a similar hashtag ""stand with reasi"" it was supressed. This is how information is controlled from reaching people. The algorithims are tampered with, they're biased.

And what supportive are you talking about? You do reealize the reason Indians harbor such strong feelings towards China and have gone soft on the west is also because of an extensive propaganda capapaign by the west in India. Think about it, who would benifit the most if India and China go to war?

And lets be honest, why are Indians so anti-China? Because they took Indian territory? Galwan? Bro Americans fund the entire Pakistani military. American jets (F-16s) were used by Pakistan to down Indian jets in Balakot. They sent their feel to the bay of Bengal in the 70s to fight India. So yeah, they're not in direct confrontatoin with us , but how many Indians have died due to American interfearence?

So what if they control everything within ther country?? As long as they are not tryng to fracture our society from within, I'll take a known enemy at the door anyday. And wdym the US society is free and not controlled? Do you even know about the NSA spyware post 9/11. They spied on US citizen, you think they aren't spying on you?

Do you even know about the US history and they shit they do that has been covered up? I am sure you know about the Nazi camps for jews, do you the US had camps for Japenese living within the US during WW2? Any person of japnese descent was thrown into these camps without a shred of proof.

The point i'm trying to make is...both are bad, I believe one is worse than the other, but yes, both are v v bad, and the best way for India to navigate this situation is to normalize ties with China so we can get the best of both worlds and play one against the other.

"Marxists have a long history in India. During the second world war, the communists opposed the quit India movement once Russia was attacked by Germans (previously they were happy to support the Germans!).

When the Soviet Union and China split, the India Communist party also split. CPI was pro Soviet, while CPM was pro Chinese. CPM went to the extent of refusing to condemn the genocide in Bangladesh because China supported Pakistan. Even to this day, CPM has failed to condemn Chinese expansionism. Nor have they ever criticized human rights violations in Tibet, Hong Kong or the treatment of Uighurs.

Why they talk about democracy and human rights in India incessantly and then become inexplicably silent about the millions killed in concentration camps in China, it is indeed hard to understand. I think it is a form of mental slavery. When we blindly support somebody we become mental slaves unable to pick and choose what parts to agree with.

The economic model India chooses to follow domestically has no bearing on India's foreign policy. GoI should encourage private sector & entreneurship.

What India most needs is cheap natural resources to power the growing Free Market capitalism and entrepreneurship of the young Indians.

2. And mass manufacturing skills & expertise that India will get from South Korea, Japan, China, Southeast Asia etc.
US & EU have turn protectionist and era of export-led model has lost its steam. What Indian companies need is to manufacture for Indian consumers. 20 crore people need cycles, motorcycles, phones, fridges, TV, washing machine, houses, cars etc. Not another Instagram, or Snapchat or Facebook or Onlyfans or Twitch.

"This case, Dalit workers trafficked to the US to build a temple, Hindujas literally enslaving Indian workers in their estates, a recent similar trafficking case in Texas, Indians duped into fighting the war in Ukraine, Indians duped into working in scam centres in SEA, the Gulf in its entirety, and probably countless other incidents that I can't think or be aware of right now. Our citizens have either masterminded or enabled such operations for long and probably will continue to. Let alone an ocean of cases and incidents within the homeland, all this truly tests my understanding of India as a united entity with a cohesive national identity.

"SS: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. has secured an “in-principle approval from the Vietnamese government” for a greenfield development in Da Nang, Karan Adani, managing director of the company, said in an interview. The project, which will have container terminals and multipurpose berths to handle various types of cargo, is at an early stage of planning and the total investment required hasn’t been finalized yet, he said.
This will be the fourth international port asset for the Adani group after Haifa in Israel, Colombo in Sri Lanka and the Port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. On Friday, Adani’s new mega port in southern India saw the arrival of its maiden mother ship and the company wants to accelerate the expansion of the facility in a bid to grab a bigger share of the international maritime trade that’s currently dominated by China.

“The idea is to make India a maritime hub,” Karan, the elder son of Gautam Adani, said. “We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries.”
Adani Ports is the largest port operator in India. It gets about 5% of its total volume from international operations and wants to increase the ratio to 10% by 2030, Karan Adani said. The company is looking at opportunities in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, East Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam and Cambodia as these are regions where trade is coming to India, he said.",r/geopoliticsindia,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaZHNpLTZ6UXRJM1l5UjNXR0NRNUNTM0VLRXVQeTVnWFpjblNaWDVYekh1dkE3TExFOWtySnJCTm5LeHJhekkweEJURUJhWEYzclgxU01hRTg0N1pQY0RZVm5BMTlLT2JCYmc4T01NbDNqczA9

"The issue is not democracy or perks. It is complying with western demands while doing so.

Since it's a democracy, we are open to interference from the outside. Western counterparts openly interfere and fuel the opposition and use it to weaken the gov. In 2014, it was US helped Bjp, now they're helping congress. That's how they maintain balance of power.

So being a democracy and having strategic autonomy is the issue. China had the advantage of closing down their country to vested interests.

US wants us to grow, but while we bend the knee. So nobody challenges their might in the future. This is the biggest challenge India faces.

China and Pak-sponsored thugs have been promoting anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh. Every second and third pages and insta handles are promoting hate against India and Indians. Bengalis from WB are also to be blamed for. They will spread hate against Bangladesh on social media and they will keep voting thugs like TMC into power.

Indians because of lack of opportunities are falling for human trafficking rackets all of over the world. You only hear about it if the trafficking network gets too big or you start seeing deaths.

📣 **[Submission Statement by OP](/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1e4f7lt/opinion_is_a_cambodiaindia_free_trade_agreement/ldegy49/)**:
> SS: Cambodia's pursuit of a free trade agreement (CIFTA) with India, despite their historical ties and significant diplomatic efforts, faces hurdles primarily due to the ""China factor."" While Cambodia aims to diversify its market and investment partners to mitigate economic challenges, India's hesitance stems from its massive trade deficit with China and concerns about Chinese goods entering through Cambodian channels. Although both countries have strengthened their relationship through high-level visits, direct flights, and a memorandum on Fintech connectivity, India's reluctance to proceed with the CIFTA reflects the complexities of India's own domestic politics and its tensed relations with China.
