"“Let’s call a spade a spade” said Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba on Jan. 9, “Putin’s demands are illegitimate and harmful to international peace and security.”  
  
Russian Federation demands to the U.S. and NATO were published in mid-December and include a demand for rejection of Ukrainian membership of NATO, non-expansion of NATO, and non-deployment of intermediate and short range missiles close to Russia.  
  
The U.S., NATO and the E.U. have strongly supported the right of Ukraine and other nations to decide their own futures and alliances as a non-negotiable principle according to international law.  
  
However, room for negotiation may exist according to U.S. Secretary Blinken in an interview at the weekend, on the issues of deployment of certain U.S. missiles and troops to Europe if Russia de-escalates and returns verifiably to international legal norms.  
  
On the other hand, both the U.S. and NATO leaders have been clear in multiple statements that an escalation by Russia will lead to a reinforcement of allied territories, increased support to Ukraine, and significant costs to the Russian Federation.  
  
  
  
Preliminary bilateral talks began in Geneva on Sunday, Jan. 9 with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman representing the United States and S Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov representing the Russian Federation according to Ned Price, spokesperson for the Department of State.  
  
In the talks, Sherman stated that the U.S. position that progress by diplomatic dialogue is most desirable and she asserted the U.S. “commitment to the international principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the freedom of sovereign nations to choose their own alliances.”  
  
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov referred to the dialogue as “ difficult, but businesslike” as reported by Ria Novosti on Jan. 9/10. Ryabkov said that the talks focused upon ‘security guarantees’ that Russia was asking for and that the Russian delegation had a “clearly formulated task that needs to be solved,” also that “ the unilateral approaches promoted by the United States and NATO cannot be the basis for a dialogue on security guarantees. At the same time, the diplomat emphasized that there are always chances to come to an agreement”.  
  
Ryabkob also concluded that the Russian Federation would like to “come to an agreement with the United States to check to what extent they are able to take responsible decisions at this current alarming moment” for European security.",r/globalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSVXJ5ZVY3NXhubVBCN3pabWFRcWM1VHpwNzZsZHF0VDBvQURYTVVrcHBZZUhCSEZROUFubmhqYXNxMU5NdWpiNlVwOHcyZWMwaUJQZUR3UDM0VnFwY2c9PQ==
"The speaker said that in Kazakhstan there was an attempt at a coup d'etat to seize power, create another hotbed of tension and disrupt the integration processes in the post-Soviet space.

 **The Kazakhstan people were viewed as a mere bargaining chip in the geopolitical game. Their interests were not taken into account at all.**  
  
“The CSTO peacekeeping mechanism was used in Kazakhstan for the first time. In the face of external danger, the president addressed the allies for help which they provided immediately. This came as a surprise to both the rioters and their Western patrons.

"Talks have gained momentum  
  
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Monday that the Vienna talks have ""picked up speed"" and the chances of reaching a solution have increased.  
  
“The Vienna talks have gained momentum. We believe that the chances of reaching a solution… have increased. This is a positive moment. All parties are showing readiness to find a solution to the remaining problems, ""Ryabkov told reporters in Geneva, according to TASS.  
  
He said ""various schemes” can be thought of for the ultimate goal that is to implement the JCPOA in the original parameters.  
  
But he emphasized that “hypothetical intermediate steps are not a replacement, not a substitution, not an alternative to the basic agreement”.  
  
Ryabkov also rejected the idea of setting deadlines for reaching a final deal.

"This was an interim meeting. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that he was satisfied with the exchange of views, which would help them next week (it was emphasised several times) to present a written response to us.  
  
Question: Yesterday the US Department of State released information to the effect that Ukraine poses no threats to Russia. It says RT is responsible for the propaganda of neo-Nazi and right-wing groups in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch also wrote about that. What is the Russian Foreign Ministry’s response to the US State Department’s statement? In what way did increased weapons supplies to Ukraine from the US and the UK impact the talks?   
  
Sergey Lavrov: You have already said everything for me. The papers the State Department prepared specially for today’s meeting are unreadable. We have a special unit headed by the Ministry’s official which is supposed to study all that. The response has already been made. I don’t think any more comments are needed. It will suffice to look it through, open to any page and realise that nothing written withstands critical scrutiny. In most cases they are pure lies.   
  
Regarding threats. We discussed Ukraine. Our US colleagues once again wanted to give top priority to the issues on the Russia-Ukraine border. They tried to make everything depend on the need for “de-escalation.” This has already become a mantra. We finished by agreeing that next week we will be given written answers to all our proposals.  
  
You mentioned the statement that Ukraine poses no threat to Russia. I will remind those who analyse our public statements and positions: Russia has never, nowhere, not once threatened the Ukrainian people through its official representatives. Meanwhile President Zelensky who has been taken under wing by our Western colleagues who encourage all his shenanigans, said publicly that if some Ukrainian citizens feel they are Russian, they should go back to Russia. He called those in Donbass, who are standing up to the state terrorism of the Kiev regime, species, not people. This shows who is threatening whom, and it is hard to say what these threats might lead to.  
  
We do not exclude that all that hysteria whipped up by our Western colleagues is intended to at least distract from the Kiev regime’s determination to totally sabotage the Minsk agreements, if not to provoke Ukraine to undertake some military actions in Donbass. I cannot think of any other explanation.  
  
We have answered all the questions asked.  Our Western colleagues admit that this is Russian territory, however, “we have assembled too many troops.” Whereas in the same breath they say that whatever the Americans do with their troops in Europe is none of our business. Antony Blinken and I spoke frankly about this. He agreed that the dialogue should be more substantive. I hope cooler heads will prevail, although there are no guarantees.",r/globalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJSYnFqbmVHZjI0bzRCZ1QzR2dscUMtTEdlSzlQd1J5NlpzaGRtaXNFWTlwN1hQS0xMV2Z5RUFmbk5Iei1NUFItbUZNN2tsdWlla2NDV0ppSU5FenFaeXc9PQ==

"The ketogenic diet is an extremely low carb, the high-fat eating routine that imparts numerous similitudes to the Atkins and low carb slims down. It includes definitely lessening carb admission and supplanting it with fat. This decrease in carbs places your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.  
Despite its popularity, it’s still not known why, or even if the keto diet works. Researchers from the University of California Riverside are attempting to find out more and therefore establish whether keto is right for you.  
Scientists from the University of California Riverside are studying how the popular keto and intermittent fasting diets work on a molecular level, and whether both sexes benefit from them equally.  
	  
The idea behind the keto diet is that low levels of carbohydrates and very high levels of fat and protein will force the body to use fat as fuel, resulting in weight loss. It’s a diet that has grown in popularity in recent years and food manufacturers have reflected this with more and more products geared towards those on the Keto regime.  
  
Intermittent fasting operates on a similar principle, restricting eating to a small window of time during the day. During the hours without food, the body exhausts its stores of sugar and switches to burning fat. The fat gets converted to ketone bodies that the brain can use as fuel.

The destruction and instability wrought during that period brought about a tendency toward the percieved stability of [authoritarianism that still exists today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia).",r/globalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdFozYXV2YUNYejE0b3pycllIcGROdHJ5dnpNWVRISVhTN2lWdEdCbFFFLXA5Q2J3YnVQbWVsNEQtS1dwN21na2ZpNXF1YldBU0NhLUtmYzVSQkpyYmc9PQ==
"The man is a liability to the U.S. this is why Putin today told the world when asked whom he preferred Biden or Trump and who would be better for Russia. Without hesitation Putin said Biden. Referring to his experience in politics.

This, a day after, Trump had said he would encourage Russia to do whatever it wants to EU \\[NATO countries\\] and withdraw from NATO. Even Putin knows, Russia benefits more if Biden wins reelection. That should answer your question.

As for Ukraine and money it is not important because Republicans and Democrats all know Ukraine never stood a fighting chance against Russia. They now know neither Putin nor the Russians are going away and Ukraine needs men to fight a war. They are running out.

So, if U.S. wants to help Ukraine, send your people to fight there. Otherwise, help salvage at least a part of viable Ukraine. Also, no chance Russia will ever allow any part of it to become a NATO member; although he may allow some part of Ukraine to become an EU member. However, time for this is running out and Biden has put himself in the box. Often repeating so long as it takes. The longer it takes the more Russia wins. This is why Putin wants Biden.

"Serious ‘mistake’. 

Right. These WCK aid workers were deliberately hunted down in 3 separate cars, attacked one by one. 

It wasn’t a case of an oopsie slipped finger on the rocket fired button. 

The ‘mistake’ was due to the western countries sitting up and getting angry. 

No such ‘serious mistake’ was admitted to when the Medicin sans Frontieres or the UK Aid for Palestinians aid convoys were attacked and people died. Funny that.
