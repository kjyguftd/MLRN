"* Stealth: While I question the usefulness and value proposition, I won't make you remove it -- just be aware these won't matter much given a) the size of the ship; b) it's escorts and/or air wings would give away its position anyways.
* Aircraft: This is acceptable in a pinch but typically not more than 80.
* Production: given the advanced propulsions methods I won't allow the retro to 2025. As such, first ship being laid down is in 2029, is coming out 2033, commissioned in 2037. I don't think the navy has the capabilities to accept a new carrier every year. I'd prefer 1 every 2 years initially, and then as per the mechanics (6mo/1y every 4th). In any case, I'm limiting the size of the class to **10+5 option** and this is being generous given the lack of justification for this amount of carriers.

"My best guess at this point is that the Dakar class (including the latest INS Drakon) with its enlarged sail is most likely a VLS for additional Popeye Turbo SLCMs rather than an SLBM.

"How long have you been a part of the r/GlobalPowers community?

7 years

Do you have any Moderator experience? If so, where and for how long?

6 years of xpowers

Why do you want to be a Moderator?

I don't, just wanted to annoy/scare bow with an application

What do you bring to the Mod Team? What skills do you have/what roles could you fill?

I will talk a lot but in reality only do minor upkeep on the yag bot or drop in to offer hot takes

I have something approaching a college degree in arguing with bow (I used to draw more paragraphs out of him than anyone else could in the GP modchat, even if that was around 2 years ago now)

"what a shocker

**How long have you been a part of the r/GlobalPowers community?**

8 years now

**Do you have any Moderator experience? If so, where and for how long?**

I have a bit I reckon, essentially all relevant xpowers(as a css mod for most of them) and my time here as a mod and head mod

**Why do you want to be a Moderator?**

This community of weirdos and freaks is my family and GP is my home. I want to be able to do whatever it takes to get it running. Also I like the color green.

**What do you bring to the Mod Team? What skills do you have/what roles could you fill?**

I've done basically everything as a GP mod before so a bit of everything tbh

**What makes you a good candidate overall?**

My experience, my standing in the community, my knowledge of GP and irl geopolitics, and a general drive to see this place succeed. Also you mentioned my US mechanic in this literal post.

"*Here we go again*

***How long have you been a part of the r/GlobalPowers community?***

I've been playing since around the start of 2017, which is absolutely crazy to me.

***Do you have any Moderator experience? If so, where and for how long?***

Yes, I modded here for a few months a few years ago as well as on /r/ColdWarPowers for a fair bit. 

***Why do you want to be a Moderator?***

This community has been a part of my online social life for almost all of my adult life, which is weird to think. But it's a part of me and I want the best for the subreddit and the Discord and am willing to put in time to make sure I can help its operation and make an enjoyable experience for everyone involved in it. 

***What do you bring to the Mod Team? What skills do you have/what roles could you fill?***

I think I bring a good perspective in and experience with writing up conflict resolutions, as well a great deal of familiarity with the majority of the community here making it easier to communicate mod-player issues.

***What makes you a good candidate overall?***

I think my experience with not only this community but other related ones as well as pretty arguably decent post writing helps my case, as well as a relatively capable knowledge of geopolitics. Having a decent understanding of the structure and operations of the US DoN I think helps as well given how present it is in a lot of the conflicts here on GP.

***How active can you be as Moderator?***

I can stand to be pretty active, especially so on the Discord side of things as I'm always looking at the app out of boredom. As well, at least for the next two years I have a very easy schedule and plenty of down time.",r/globalpowers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaW5iX1A3YWlkeWt4OTRtUnJ5Vko2ZjZBcXd5OTBERVh6dGN4SDlXTF93Q3BCaExqY1pGcGI0cEJPZTVyLXg5bEZYSUVNVkQ0SWVqSjVKQnB4RUN5Qk9GY0w2Q1Npc1hzUWhRdXpHa1RLcEE9

"Hello, this is Erhard

How long have you been a part of the community?

- The duration of the last season. I am pretty new to this community.

Do you have any Moderator experience? If so, where and for how long?

- I was a moderator of Geosim for approximately three years

Why do you want to be a Moderator?

- I’d like to see GlobalPowers run again. It will take many hands to get this running again, and many hands to keep it running. I believe that I could have a helpful part in helping the community restart gameplay.

What do you bring to the Mod Team? What skills do you have/what roles could you fill?

- I am willing to do what is needed to keep things going, and am flexible in that way. I can focus on what needs to be worked on, and won’t silo myself into any specific category ( e.g battles or econ), but I can silo myself if that is necessary. I’m not a particularly strong community moderator, meaning I am not really a fan of managing out-of-character chats in discord and have trouble keeping up with all the community related channels (I’m kind of a boomer), but I can make a habit out of clicking through IC chats if requested and doing NPCs there. I will bring my own ideas and thoughts to the team and take part in meaningful discussion to bring us closer to a new game.

What makes you a good candidate overall?
	⁠- I am motivated to help restart this game, and to run a successful game. I will bring my own ideas and opinions and ask that they are respectfully listened to and I am not afraid to have my ideas challenged, I’m not afraid to be wrong/proven wrong and won’t get upset about it. I can provide constructive input and my perspective, and I will happily execute a consensus team decision whether or not I personally agree or disagree. I like to help new players enjoy the game as much as I do.

How active can you be as Moderator?

- I’m a family man so I’m primarily an evening and weekend moderator.

Other xPowers games played but not moderated

- CWP

Whether you can speak/write any other languages than English

- Mandarin

If there is anything you wish to ask us in your application

- In what ways has the team already considered accommodating a game for decreased player population?

- How has the team found new players in the past?",r/globalpowers,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtSnktX0JoVV9jTkZQdlQ5a3l2cTJlX056T2hqM3lkMU8wbkllWUhDSGkxVDdTRFJORmduZi1nemRkVmFkZm4tdXJCRGJ4Y0MtaFBUWEtVOUxiM19vV3c9PQ==
"Hiiiiii its Vixen! I have no expectation of getting it but I'll apply anyway 😊

I've been here since February, so not super long I guess compared to a lot of others but I'm very active most of the time! My work schedule is extremely flexible so I can make myself free as needed.

I have no previous experience with this kinda thing, but I'm a quick learner and I'd love to provide the same welcoming, friendly, and supportive vibe I was given when I first showed up here. This is such an open and cool community and the consequence of that for me is spending far too much time here. 

I just graduated with one of my degrees in PolSci and I'm pretty good at researching and writing about ongoing world issues, so if you need someone as a writer for posts I can certainly give it my best shot (glad to write samples for you if you need!) Otherwise, I think I'd be really good at being present in discord, esp during low hours where less people may be awake because I'm a night owl and usually work late anyway. I think I've been present and interacting well enough people have a feeling of who I am and I'm not a total stranger anymore which is cool too 😊

Admittedly I have zero prior experience so again, totally get it if I just dont pass the vibe check OR if like a probationary type deal happens where i just sorta chill and learn. Either way just glad to apply!!

I know so little Russian and French that I can only confidently say I speak English sadly, but I'm picking up more Russian piecemeal, so that's a work in progress :)

I'm 23 from New England, so eastern time but I'll be moving soon-ish, which I can keep you all appraised about.

"Well that was a trip down memory lane.

Yet after such a long time, my beloved xPowers subreddit sails steadily onward. Massive thanks to all the mods, past and current, who held this place together and gave it a future. Your sacrifice of personal time, privacy and sanity was always very appreciated.
