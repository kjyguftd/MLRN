"I get what you're saying but it's easier said than done. Japanese dudes would rather have virtual waifu's than real girls and Japanese women would rather focus on their jobs than get a man. In my opinion, Japanese people are extreme in everything they do, they have always been like that. For example during World War 2, the Japanese people literally thought their emperor was an actual god. (After Japan was defeated the Japanese emperor had to tell his people that he was not a god ). You see other examples of it in modern times like with cars. Japanese cars are known to be the most efficient.

"Canadian, west coast. Most infrastructure and economic systems continue to function. There are very slight smells of war about the place, much as in the UK.

The wealthier classes are doing well. The weather's lovely where I am, no igloos. Been a few dry years, this wet cool spring and early summer have been very good for the forest.

"I'm late to the thread, but here's my take as a service provider in Vietnam to (quite an amount of) Indian tourists:

1. Loud and obnoxious

2. Always bartering, even when the price is deep low, can't get it? Steal it

3. Sweaty, Curry smell, or just Horny, probably all 3

4. They come in packs, with tens of bags making any hotel bellboy just want to chop their hands off and clock out

5. Rich but very, VERY stingy, most of them won't tip, making serving them borderline slave labor

6. Super toxic towards any worker, they see it as a ""lower class"" person, this is deeply stitched into their culture",r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNdUtrYkpudm5GT1Z3N04tbXQ4eXRXQ3Z1N1lGRzVuN3JUSHh4TDBUMUNWU1J4RHZUZWF6YTBMU0VBLWVDU1VWNE56aEl0ZmJpdkpNZjQ1clhFejRkU0oxNzV4OVlWTHpJOGYzc3ozaG90SVE9

"Usually those actions that benefit others are considered good, and those that harm others are considered evil.  The more interesting part is determining who benefits and who suffers.  

If your village is low on clean water and you build a dam and distribution system for your village and no one goes thirsty, that would be considered a good act done with good intentions. 

The next village downstream may now have a reduced river flow and could be facing issues.  They might consider that dam building actitiy to be evil.  

If the dam builder starts charging for the water to cover costs and all the accounting is transparent and audited, it would be considered a neutral act.  If he has a goal to make a profit on a resource required for life, then we are back to evil.",r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXcGhvX1VQb0JPVDkxaVd2c2NkWWdYVDBCS2d1Nm4zYWhING52TmlfQjJ5Q1plZUtmNlJQUmhhdHRYMHhYa3RyRFBleEFKZWJEMjdjLUoxNjBzN0laZGc9PQ==

"Very late to this thread, but I live in the western United States, which has a pretty high Indian population, even in rural areas. So when I see an Indian person, I usually assume that they’re residents/citizens, or more recent immigrants if they have an accent. I’ve never had any problems with those that are traveling in my area; in my experience they tend to be pretty respectful. There are some seedy men like every ethnic group, but they’re pretty easy to spot and avoid. ",r/globaltalk,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYY0RtdVZGZjdzTmFtYnNvQ3hzWTNnazY5QkI3WXNRMWVhTlVwNnZNb2Q4QnB0QTZ6VWtPSFNLYjBvaXp6VmlySGthQWlsdmdnVVZWaWFnUXZGVFU0S01NemNPeUE4b096akJBcXNqMXNHX0U9

"Love the downvotes, let me actually lay out how to think critically, which you all lack. 

While the political landscape around Trump is highly charged, claiming that no truth or fact can emerge because of personal agendas is both defeatist and inaccurate.

Countless independent and credible investigative journalists, watchdog organizations, and fact-checkers work tirelessly to uncover and present the truth. Suggesting that all of them are manipulated or twisted undermines the very foundation of democratic scrutiny and accountability.

Furthermore, blaming one individual for all mayhem and chaos oversimplifies complex socio-political issues.

"Ok great how about Biden?

First, Hunter Biden’s business dealings, particularly in Ukraine and China, have raised significant questions about potential conflicts of interest and ethical concerns. Emails and documents found on Hunter Biden’s laptop have suggested that Joe Biden might have been aware of, and possibly involved in, his son’s business activities. This matter is under federal investigation, focusing on potential tax violations and foreign lobbying.

Second, Joe Biden’s involvement in the 1994 Crime Bill, formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, has been widely criticized. This legislation led to a dramatic increase in incarceration rates, disproportionately affecting African American and Latino communities. Critics argue that this bill contributed to systemic racism within the criminal justice system and exacerbated social inequalities.

Third, there have been allegations of inappropriate conduct and misuse of power. For example, Tara Reade, a former Senate aide, accused Biden of sexual assault, which he has denied. While these allegations have not been proven, they are serious and deserve thorough investigation.

"Regardless ( !!! ) of weather this is a false flag: two people dying means that something can not be a false flag operation? 

Why? 

How would using real bullets to commit a hypothetical attack proof that it was staged?

Anyone who has even just read ""the prince"" ( or studied history ) can attest to the potential ruthlessness of trying to keep or (re)gain power. 

If any candidate generic could themselves ( or perhaps just someone among their supporters with enough influence ) be considered ruthless/determined ( whatever other term one might use ) enough to deem unrelated civilians dying an acceptable casualty, this kind of popularity boost might happen. 

Of course, on its own this too would prove nothing since even if someone could and would buy themselves gold limbs if they suffered an injury, it doesn’t mean that they would actually intentionally cut of their own but the truth can only be found by examining the evidence because we don’t know what we are looking at.

"The fact that I have to question if this was real or staged to use as fuel for a political win, disturbs me to my core.  I believe that trump followers would die for the cause.  I also believe normal rational people can be driven to commit acts of this nature. 

My rather large family and I have gathered more than once to seriously discuss the similarities between the rise of Nazi Germany and the Trump administration.  Lies, propaganda, fear and hate mongering, planned insurrections, Yes, I believe it was planned.  His comments over the years regarding placing people in camps, stating that he was the chosen one.

I realized suddenly that during these recent family discussions, regarding events over the past 10 years are very similar to the gatherings my great grandparents and family members had in Germany.  Before they escaped and during the insanity and genocide.  Understanding  this during our discussions brought me to a terrifying rationalization.  Its happening again.  I can't shake that feeling.

I also believe that Trump is a KGB plant, promised Oligarch level wealth, to weaken the country from the inside for take over.  Its possible that Russia, China and North Korea are involved, shaping the Trump landscape.  Ukraine is a horrifying, crime against humanity used to distract from Russian involvement.

Foreign hacker groups known to work for their government establishments were found to have successfully infiltrated US infrastructure, gathering information for at least a decade.  They may know how to shut everything down and cause a chaotic shit storm.

The United States is under attack from both internal and external forces and I feel like I'm watching the end of the United States of America.

I am an educated and rational man.  Reading everything I just wrote sounds like a paranoid conspiracy rant.  I roll my eyes when I've heard crazy shit like this in my life.  I hope and pray that I'm wrong and the obvious events that have occurred over the past 20 years are only frightening coincidence.

"Looking closer, it looks so fake.
Trump looking around like there is nothing to worry about. Always showing confident theatral moments . You look at it all, 2 more times and think about it. Wtf is he doing in a dead or life moment? Trump Circus is in town.
