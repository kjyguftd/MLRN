Stop using GPT to cheat at education 🖕,r/gpt,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlR3dRemJEQ2xMZFVVLVY0UXZYZDNXbGd3OG1jWU92aWhHQWhESmxHdTRTQTluZ0xGc1VvS1pOX3p3QVFLVlQzMUNKcjg2SC1vVHh1NFZuRTAxMk1QMGc9PQ==
"In order to get really cool tips from this community, I suggest you explain exactly what you did that led to the detection. The reality is that some people understand how to use these tools to cheat, and some don’t. It’s not rocket science, but you have to take the perspective of your professor or teacher to figure out how to actually leverage the capabilities of these tools.

These are my general ideas for cheating in a way that is both ethical and practical:

1. First, realize this: Even if you circumvent the “detection,” there’s a good chance that your teacher or professor might suspect you cheated if they get the subtle feeling that something is not right. This could lead them to question your knowledge on the subject and test you in person to see whether or not you understand what you wrote. If you want to cheat, you have to make them believe that you did the work yourself.

1. Consider discussing the use of AI with your teacher or professor. There’s no reason why any teacher should prohibit the use of AI. There are many ways to use them that are not cheating. This includes spell checking, grammar checking, formatting help, etc. In the case of formatting, AI can use markdown language to quickly create the correct formatting of headings, lists, etc. Also, typographical errors can be fixed, such as the wrong use of different typographically similar quotes. AI can help you quickly understand complex concepts as you read about them. When you read material, you may use AI to input parts of the text and have it explain it for you in different ways. This way, AI actually teaches you something. You may then discuss the topics you’ve learned with your teacher to see if you got it right before actually writing about it. That way, your teacher can see that you’re a learner and not a cheater, and that you realize the importance of learning good AI practices that will boost learning.
1. Don’t use just one AI tool. While ChatGPT is good for writing logically coherent paragraphs, Google Gemini is good for reasoning about complex issues. Have them cooperate to build your knowledge and texts really quickly. 

1. If you have a smartphone, I recommend writing parts of your texts on the bus, in your bed, or wherever. This makes your brain actually master the most important parts of your texts and creates a feeling in you that you are actually doing some of the work. Specifically, if you’re an iPhone user, I recommend using the native keyboard and turning on all the writing help features in settings. This way, you’re using exceptionally advanced handheld AI to boost your writing. The text predictions of the iPhone native keyboard are insane if you really analyze how it works. If you write grammatically correct, coherent paragraphs, the keyboard actually knows what the text is about, and some of the word predictions are eerily accurate and relevant when the text deals with a very specific topic.
1. ***For this one I need to declare that I pay for both ChatGPT plus and Google Gemini Advanced. Each of them is 20 bucks a month or so. So I’m NOT biased in this sense.*** Anyway: You don’t have to start with ChatGPT. Google Gemini is actually better at creating meaningful and interesting outlines and suggesting improvements. ChatGPT is for, well… Actually, Gemini is better for cheating. That’s the truth. ChatGPT, however, might be used to explain things to you, format text, summarize and structure data, etc., but not for the actual cheating. This is not my opinion; it’s a fact.

1. If you use Gemini from a computer, you can basically write high-quality texts by selecting parts of its output and typing in a box that appears. If you type e.g. “explain” and hit enter, Gemini will expand that specific part of the text, i.e., what you selected, and replace it with longer sentences or even whole paragraphs that make the text incorporate your request. This way, you can avoid writing stuff you don’t understand. Like, it’s impossible to not understand the text if you do this repeatedly. In my opinion, this specific feature is the most potent learning tool I have ever seen. It’s probably underestimated.

1. Know that these tools are not currently able to create a list of references. They inevitably “cheat” themselves by making up references. You can’t trick them. I believe they are not built to actually cheat. Therefore, they are very good at mimicking correct referencing and citation, but they can’t provide the sources and cite them for you. They can’t provide sources for the information they provide because they didn’t use sources to find out what to write. They simply knew it, and they are not equipped with the ability to understand why they know something. This is a fundamental insight that you have to have in order to cheat successfully. There’s a good chance that cheating is detected by realizing that the student’s bibliography didn’t really match the contents of the text. THIS is what can be detected. As other people have pointed out, there’s no way to detect AI use to write a text. However, it’s easy to spot a cheater if the task was to read something and then write about it, and the student hasn’t even handled the files that held the information they refer to.

1. Chat with the chats. This is what they are best at. If you actually chat with them about your work in an intelligent way, together you could come up with great content. They could suggest search queries or works to look into. This way, you can go find the sources that they suggest manually, and then simply upload the sources and have them write the text for you only using the content found in these sources. When doing this, make sure to explicitly instruct them not to search the web and only use the files you provided, and—importantly—always tell them to quote the material so you can manually check that the information actually exists in the material! Here’s a pro tip: if you create a “custom GPT,” you can upload lots of sources to it and uncheck the option “search the web.” This will ensure that the custom GPT only uses the uploaded material.
1. When you build a text, especially if it has many parts, work with one part of the text at the time, BUT always let the models know the context. So if your work is 5 pages long, work with one page at a time, but first paste/upload the entire text so that the model knows what it’s all about. Context is always key when working which these language models. They are built to understand things.

1. Continuously let the models summarize your texts. To do this, always create a new chat first, upload or paste your text and ask it to explain or summarize the text. Pro tip: Always do this two times, in two different chats. In one of the chats you state that the work is another’s, and in the other chat you state that the work is yours. The reply you get will will sometimes heavily depend on what context the model works with. If it’s your texts, it will be more likely to find ways to improve the work. If it thinks that someone else wrote it, it will obviously not suggest improvements. Rather, it will focus on a deeper analysis, finding different ways to interpret and understand the text.

"ChatGPT can do it fairly well, but I’d recommend a) paying good attention to the prose style’s description, to try and make it output from the get-go as “human-like” a style as possible, and b) give it a second pass, afterwards, fragment by fragment, at rewriting it more in this “human-like” style… the reason is that in the original generation, the AI has to deal with more than just the (by themselves relatively complex) prose style instructions, it also has to consider the whole subject you ask it to write about, the requested structure, etc., so it becomes weaker at doing it *all* well; in that second pass, the basic contents are already written, so the AI’s only task is to rewrite it (still according to your instructions) into more “human-like”.",r/gpt,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJveHhnWjFNMWpqZ0JjTXFaMlB0MzRjTzVzZVVwWl9KbUE5ekdTMDJIUTFoM2dlYW9CaEhZVUthaGNUMV94ektqX2l4dmlxX2dCVkpjYkY3RzJodDNaS3c9PQ==

"## Militarization: My thoughts

AI can be used to distort, deteriorate and destruct; attempts of such usage is inevitable. Therefore, we must face the fact that we do not control the future of AI by choosing whether to use it for military purposes or not; we already know what awaits those who cannot protect themselves from the power of knowledge. The authoritarian forces of the world wants to exploit the Global South to gain control over the waters and threaten the current world order. This means that the non-authoritarian use of AI should be considered from a long-term perspective as a means to enter a new era of peace through disarmament and knowledge-based deterrence. The alternative is a third world war, resulting in nuclear threats. 

The potential to prevent a nuclear war comes from AI's ability to change international relations by improving communication and data analysis among countries, fostering cooperation and understanding. AI can revolutionize security by enabling real-time threat assessment, military collaboration, and strategic decision-making based on superior data analysis. This can turn information asymmetry into a security advantage, deterring aggression and reducing the risk of military miscalculation. 

The U.S., as the sole military and technological superpower, maintains a large military budget to deter authoritarian expansion and protect most of the Earth. The Pacific Fleet, a cornerstone of American military power in the region, must be shielded from Chinese attacks to maintain freedom of navigation, ensure the stability of U.S. allies and partners in the region, and deter potential Chinese aggression. 

Advanced information defense systems are needed for threat detection and response from space. AI will enhance such systems by analyzing massive amounts of data from multiple sources in real-time, identifying subtle changes in satellite imagery and predicting future developments based on historical data and current trends. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the global military landscape and enables faster and more accurate detection of potential threats. AI can also sift through and analyze complex data sets to identify potential threats that human analysts might miss. By providing military leaders with a more accurate picture of the potential consequences of their actions, AI can help to prevent wars. 

We can prevent hostile mobilization through surveillance, early warning, and rapid response by letting satellite-based ridiculously powerful modular AI systems analyze and integrate massive amounts of real-time data about what’s going on down there, including tracking the movements of fleets aircraft and missile launches faster than traditional methods (i.e. involving humans). AI-equipped satellites can detect and interpret indicators of impending attacks or military build-ups by analyzing patterns and anomalies in data. This provides early warnings to military and civilian authorities, allowing for proactive measures to be taken before conflicts escalate.

Upon threat detection, these space AI systems can coordinate with ground-based defense to deploy countermeasures such as missile defense, drones, or jamming. This swift response capability, driven by AI's speed and accuracy, can significantly **reduce the window of opportunity for hostile actions** (THIS IS THE KEY), thus deterring potential aggressors and minimizing the impact of any hostile actions. 

Additionally, AI-powered systems can analyze intercepted communications and signals for intelligence purposes, helping to uncover plans and strategies of hostile forces. This intelligence can inform strategic decisions and diplomatic actions to prevent conflicts. AI-driven intelligence gathering can provide valuable insights into the intentions and capabilities of potential adversaries, facilitating informed decision-making at all levels of government and military command.

As you can see, the idea that there’s a problem with militarization of AI is propaganda bullshit favoring relinquishing power and allowing authoritarian regimes to dominate future generations. Real life is militarized and there’s no way to change that without fighting the fire with water. Soon, the waters will be all about space.",r/gpt,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3aXpZVWVaUFB5QjBEYkZuVUxyRk1KdmlEeDFfTU9Ka292aHA0OERCa0c5QWl1b3ZaVUxmcW5idXBEc2R6OFp4OWpzRnFWYVFQR1BfQlRDRV9LUjFSWnc9PQ==

"I think what is missed most commonly in the discussion of ethics is not so much the usage of AI, but the branding in comparison to the reality of what we are talking about as AI.

No AI has awareness. No AI is capable of autonomous independent learning. No AI is remotely intelligent.

Most machine learning techniques is imitation through data processing. These systems are not learning how to do something, they're learning how to replicate the data it is trained on. This is basically a parrot, but parrots are smarter than AI.

They're still impressive and can give people the illusion of intelligence or awareness, but that is likely playing against the best chess AI and thinking it's intelligent because it makes good moves. There's a seriously dangerous lack of awareness in AI systems. It doesn't know things it wasn't taught.

The scariest thing for me about current AI is how easy they are to trick into false assumptions or beliefs with the smallest of word changes. They have no grasp of any concept, so which words are used can radical alter the results given by these AI.

Military is the worst as AI is incapable of intuitive leaps of logic, making cold calculations that can flip from innocent to terrorist based on a few pixels, ignoring that it was a child playing with a toy gun. AI do do so much before it quickly finds the limitations of its abilities as it can only imitate, not create.

People using a technology they don't understand while giving it abilities it doesn't have because they've seen too many sci fi movies. People are going to be seriously disappointed when AI isn't doing all the things they thought... It's going to go the way of fission. Taking decades longer and still no currently no model is capable of producing intelligent results by self learning.",r/gpt,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5X09ELWRWZ3hDOFc0MllIZWlVTGlsU2txeEU3UUFYQ3B5ellLclczejlaMzE1UXBKTlU0amxSbFdpRTFZTmJzdVJicFUycmdrNnBsZ2N5dGw4d2Frcnc9PQ==
This sounds like a unique and creative combination!,r/gpt,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5Ykd3NEJuWE5YalRna3RQd2NNT1ppLU1Ka1ljc3F6TGxLODktaE9SMkkwNV93ejdOc0ZrUDVXNnlQYjNMd1F2VW1NYy1oUVU1dXdvemZGc3lkQUhNX1E9PQ==
