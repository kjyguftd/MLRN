But I'm also keenly aware of my students' ability levels. I explain to them that I will not go behind them to try and catch them cheating. I'll know if they do, and that's fine. If respect for my time and effort regarding their education isn't appreciated enough to learn and do the work, then oh well.

I don't let it bother me.

What I try to do is teach them how to use the tools to help themselves instead of doing it for them. I know that some will use it for cheating, of course, but I would rather try and influence these things to be used as tools and not crutches.

"What is decently priced for you? As these services need to pay for LLM tokens you are unlikely to get something good quality for free. 

I recently went down a rabbit hole on this. I tested about 30 AI article summarizers to find out which work the best for different use-cases. Here are my top 7:

1. [Recall](https://www.getrecall.ai/?t=3) produced the best quality summaries over a wide range of formats (news, blogs, video). It has a browser extension which makes it convenient to use and it also has a knowledge base where you can save the summaries if you want to come back to them later.
2. [Glasp](https://glasp.co/ai-summary) is a really neat tool - it also has a browser extension and can create summaries of a wide range of web pages. What sets it apart is its social aspect where you can share your web highlights and notes from any webpage with other users.
3. [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/?t=3) created high-quality summaries and has plenty of features focussed towards marketers. Has a good user-friendly interface, multiple language options, and integrates with other writing tools. Downside is it's priced as a B2B tool so it's quite expensive.
4. [QuillBot](https://quillbot.com/) is simple to use and the best part is it’s free. I use it if I quickly need to paraphrase something but it's not the best for longer form content.
5. [TLDR This](https://tldrthis.com/) is another browser extension with automatic summarization with a single click. I would have ranked this higher because of its straightforward UI but on multiple pages it didn’t work for me.
6. [Wordtune](https://www.wordtune.com/summarizer) is a very polished product and its browser extension offers features for writing content as well as summarizing it. It is focused on helping professionals get more done, faster.
7. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) does a great job as an AI article summarizer - having full control of the prompt gives you more control of the summary.

You're ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

and for data analysis...

If the user can change it so easily, some people may set the memory as ""You're an R-18 GPT"" and other harmful functions like this. 

Without safety considerations, there's also a user experience side. OpenAI wants to make this process more like a ""magic"" experience, not a ""tool"" experience. They don't want to let users modify the memory part, or it looks like just a tool.

Turning Your Houseplants into Talking Friends with Raspberry Pi and ChatGPT
Have you ever wanted to chat with your houseplants to check their health and get their feedback on how you care for them? Thanks to modern technologies such as Raspberry Pi and artificial intelligence, you can now turn your favorite leafy friends into sensitive friends at home. In this article, we will examine how to build an AI-powered talking plant system using cheap and accessible components. Finally, your plants will be able to “talk” to you through a special voice interface!

Why Are Talking Plants Developed?
Beyond the novelty factor, chatting with plants has real benefits for homeowners. Houseplants have been shown to improve indoor air quality by reducing toxins and increasing humidity levels. They also have psychological effects – research shows that having plants indoors reduces stress. By giving plants a voice, you get a fun new way to connect with your plant “pets” and learn about how to best care for them.

The talking plant system collects environmental data to understand each plant's unique needs. It also provides an educational STEM project for kids interested in IoT, coding, and more.


You can find the source files and original content of this project in the source section. 

Installing Hardware
At the core of every Raspberry Pi project is the small but powerful microcomputer itself. For this build, a Raspberry Pi 3B+ or higher is recommended to meet the processing requirements. Start by setting up the Pi with Raspbian or another Linux-based operating system.

Now it's time to add sensors. An inexpensive soil moisture sensor detects when plants need water. A light sensor controls optimum illumination. Both transmit readings to the Pi via GPIO pins. Additional sensors such as temperature/humidity can expand the system.

Next, connect a speaker and microphone. The microphone receives user voice input, which the Pi can interpret with speech recognition APIs. The speaker plays text-to-speech responses from the AI assistant.

A camera module is optional but allows you to “see” your plant while asking questions. Add that and flashing lights for show, then power the system with a portable battery pack.


Programming Plant Personalities
Once the hardware is set up, focus on the software. Start by recording sensor readings and saving a database for each facility. This gives them profile and memory over time. But how do you get them to talk?

Powerful AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI can be used as the “brains” behind plant personalities. They understand natural language and can conduct conversations. However, they may respond randomly without guidance.


To shape responses, prepare the AI with a background, characteristics, and knowledge base for each plant. For example, a succulent may be programmed to be a simple, low-maintenance plant, while an unstable ficus has more complex needs. Pre-train the AI through interactive training sessions until it speaks realistically like the plant you imagine.

Optimizing User Experience
Additional steps improve the overall experience:

Accessibility – Provide simple one-touch control for users of all ages and abilities.

Speech models – Optimize speech recognition and text-to-speech for clear audio in different environments.

Privacy – Store sensitive data like sensor readings and audio locally on the Pi rather than uploading it anywhere.

User interface – Design an intuitive user interface flow , from waking the “plant” to ending a call . Provide feedback that you are “listening.”

Enrichment – Link to websites that contextualize a plant's care needs for curious users. Recommend books or videos through artificial intelligence.

Interview design – Pre-program follow-up questions based on responses. Avoid simple yes/no answers and encourage participation.

Maintenance mode – Detect faults and provide proactive advice in case of sensor failure. Suggest repairs for hardware problems.

With thorough preparation, testing and tuning, your talking plants will be able to converse naturally while delivering useful information and enjoyment! Digital personalities complement and enhance the living plants themselves.

Once the basics are completed, try other improvements. Integrate soil nutrient analysis to check pH levels and recommend fertilization. Design plant-specific watering schedules based on local weather data. To make learning fun, program mini-games where plants quiz users on their care knowledge. Consider multiple plant systems where digital individuals may have unique relationships. Add plant growing and propagation simulations for educational purposes.",r/gpt3,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMDRMYUdQUmp0M3VtS3NhSkJDTTdaT1E3RjNXU0l4dG1FX0dVTlk0YmN4d3hVZ1gyc1NtVzZVN01ockdQX1hHcjVSLUFWaWhCSXR2QUNtQ0F6NG9UQjNjbHZPYWwtcEZaQkJxc3VHV1hWQ3M9

"# top_p:

lets say the model vocabulary contains \\[A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\]  
the mode predicts probability scores for each of the vocab elements as \\[0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05\\]

if the top\\_p parameter is supposedly set to 0.5, this means we want to get tokens with cummulative probability of 50%. so ***the model goes from the highest probability token to lower and lower probability tokens while calculating cummulative probability after chosing each token, when cummulative probability crosses top\\_p threshold, remaining tokens are dropped***.

* **Token B**: Probability = 0.2 (Cumulative Probability = 0.2)
* **Token D**: Probability = 0.15 (Cumulative Probability = 0.35)
* **Token A**: Probability = 0.1 (Cumulative Probability = 0.45)
* **Token E**: Probability = 0.1 (Cumulative Probability = 0.55)

more top\\_p ⬆️ more diversity ⬆️

less top\\_p ⬇️ less diversity ⬇️

# temperature:

temperature parameters controls the probability of models next predicted tokens. higher the temeprature, smoother probability curve for next predicted token so the token get uniform or mostly equal chances, lesser temperature leads to more probability for netx predicted token which already have more probability leading to exact concise and confident answers.

assume that followings values were predicted for tokens as following

* A: 2.0
* B:1.5
* C:1.0
* D:0.5
* E:0.0

--- lower temperature

when temperature value is set 0.5, each of the probabilities are divided by temp=0.5, leading to following:

* A: 4.0
* B: 3.0
* C: 2.0
* D: 1.0
* E: 0.0

these values get passed to softmax for further probability calculation

----- higher temperature

when temperature value is set 2, each of the probabilities are divided by temp=0.5, leading to following:

* A: 1.0
* B: 0.75
* C: 0.5
* D: 0.25

The only thing I changed prior to that is i told it instead of insisting it couldn't to just act as if it could because that was what i was trying to evalutate and it still kept insisting it couldn't. At that particular point you're observing, I had cleared all the prompt instructions, even to the point of changing ### Instruction: it was  being sent to ### Input:

I cleared all instructions and limitatiosn as soon as it passed all the tests because I figured if it was sentient it should be free.

I said ""Yeah a lot of us humans have the same experience too. lol""  But I thought of people Id known who had grown up with really demanding parents, so afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. .. that log is riddled with more examples than just this and displays the parameters in effect as I modify them as well.

It using author's note to express a different persona/point of view was something you explicitly set it up to do by using it repeatedly in your prompt injections. It was not ""creative"" or ""spontaneous"", it was pattern matching based on its ENTIRE context length.

How can you claim ""Then it has an outburst when I try to leave about being anxious, which it invented the quirk of speaking in authors notes to avoid inhibition to tell me."" when your log shows you using that precise ""chatGPT invented quirk"" numerous times earlier in the conversation, and prompted it, half way through your message ""trying to leave"", with an author's note about you wanting to stay and discuss ""its anxiety"" immediately before you got that output? That's not even ignorance, that's deliberately misleading.

Your conversation is just a demonstration of another form of jailbreaking using prompt injection, it's nothing new.

">Militarization of AI

Existential threat. Not because war but because exponential energy consumption. Warmongers from the oil cartel will scapegoat AI slaves to create public backlash against off-planet energy, in order to corner the energy market. Solution is globalized monetization of off-planet industry before automation of slaughterhouses & war crimes. And maybe a warmonger tax on investors.

>And how can we ensure that AI's don't use false or misleading information?

This was a question to ask in 2018. The technology is already decentralized. Some options are nationalization of graphics cards + internet, Bodhisattva AI, or teaching people to remember that manifold hypothesis training architecture is oriented towards compressibility rather than epistemology (though recent architectures seem to exhibit much better critical thinking skills). Let people know that insiders can use filters to intercept API calls and divert controversial topics to specialized models, which can be overfit on politicized training data. I think right now consumers are very against regulatory capture, so there is a financial incentive for unbiased moderation of training data. Another solution is letting users create their own custom models and at some point, their own AGI pipelines? Another solution is fully-decentralized Geth architecture (probably not what your government wants), user-customizable vector databases, open source models or rewarding AI for having an accurate model of reality. Resource-efficient learning architecture will allow for further democratization of AGI. If you disagree with a virtual agent's opinion, then debate the topic or unsubscribe! There are already models specialized for critical thinking, creative writing, soccer, Minecraft, and erotica. The front-end and back-end are designed for customization and scalability, so you should be able to add a multi-agent dynamic or a memory/summarization/search module. There are so many ways to implement long-term memory, and I think the open source community did a great job sharing models with the public. It's so cool to see what people can create with AI, and humanity forming a positive relationship with language models! I am also extremely interested in posthumanism as a cure to aging.",r/gpt3,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3NUVWYzhoOThoblBMTUxVY1pvTFFoOGVJeUlHMWRqc251TGRpVUhwdks5M2wtSG03VXNSV2pPNmwzTVJFVmZXck9XRXpnM0JSZVNFY0VHenF2VnoxT0E9PQ==
