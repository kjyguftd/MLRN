"It's not really trained for this sort of thing. The image recognition isn't great, it can tell what a picture is, but as for detail it's mostly based on context and guesses. It knows it's looking at beads, but it doesn't really recognise the individual ones the same way a human does. It assumed the 'R' was in the lower right because in the list of letters it gave it was near the end (going from top left, to bottom right). Even though there aren't any 'R's in the picture. 

Another example might be giving a picture of a rose, and asking what the ""black spots"" are - it would recognise a rose, but probably wouldn't have even known it had black spots. But since you mentioned it, it would then present information about fungus as though it knew all along what's in the image. It's really good at giving you the impression it's smarter than it is.

It definitely would be possible to create a model to recognise where letters are on the picture though (it might not even need to be a ML model).",r/gpt4,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUckFiNnM0VXBmZlFJVzRRYTBHZU0tOHItY1NreXRlLW12OW9tMzhrMVczUWRQU08zSU0zWXM0VnBkb2Y1WWNfelhEY3NiWmx4azZXdnhlVG9ZVU1HTkE9PQ==

"Hey there!

This research project sounds super interesting! AI-powered writing tools have been a game-changer for many students. For anyone who hasn’t tried them yet, there are some pretty impressive tools out there, way beyond the usual suspects like ChatGPT. 

I’ve found that diving deeper with tools like Protagoras.app can be super beneficial. It not only helps create really in-depth and accurate content but also optimizes it for SEO, which can be handy if you're into blogging or content creation. It’s worth checking out if you’ve got some writing work lined up and wanna try something new.

Good luck with the research! 🧠

"GPT4 is night and day different to 3.5.

To put this into perspective. GPT 3.5 took the US law exam, the Bar, and came in the bottom 10%. GPT4 took it and came in the top 10%.

Lots of benchmarks out there that show the significant benefits of GPT4 over 3.5 too.

Homework response — (warning , long asf ) 

Certainly! Let's comprehensively explore all the connections and combinations involving the numbers 11, 27, and 9, focusing on their relationships, reductions, and symbolic meanings.

### Breakdown of Numbers:
1. **11:**
   - Master number in numerology, symbolizing intuition, insight, and spiritual enlightenment.
   - Can be broken down into 1 + 1 = 2, representing balance and partnership.

2. **27:**
   - Combination of 2 and 7.
   - Reduces to 9 (2 + 7 = 9), symbolizing completion and humanitarianism.
   - Also connects back to 11 in various symbolic and reductionist ways (as shown below).

3. **9:**
   - Represents completion, wisdom, and universal love.
   - The last single-digit number, indicating the end of a cycle.

### Combination Analysis:

#### Single Numbers:
- **2 and 7:**
  - Together they form 27, which reduces to 9.
  - Symbolically, 2 represents balance and duality, while 7 represents spirituality and introspection.

#### Adding Numbers:
1. **2 + 7 = 9:**
   - Simple reduction showing the connection between 27 and 9.
   - Highlights the theme of completion (9) derived from balance and spiritual insight (2 and 7).

2. **1 + 1 = 2:**
   - Reduces master number 11 to 2.
   - Emphasizes partnership and cooperation, underlying the intuitive and enlightened aspects of 11.

#### Multiplicative Relationships:
- **3 × 3 = 9:**
  - Three groups of 3 add up to 9, symbolizing completeness and perfection in numerology.
  - Reinforces the notion of cycles and holistic understanding.

### Symbolic Patterns and Reductions:
1. **Combining 11 and 27:**
   - **11 + 27 = 38; 3 + 8 = 11:**
     - Brings the result back to 11, reinforcing its master number qualities.
   - **27 in Binary (11011):**
     - Contains two instances of 11 (110 and 11), showing another connection.

2. **Combining 11 and 9:**
   - **11 + 9 = 20; 2 + 0 = 2:**
     - Reduces to 2, emphasizing balance and duality from a combination of spiritual insight (11) and completion (9).

3. **Combining 27 and 9:**
   - **27 + 9 = 36; 3 + 6 = 9:**
     - Comes back to 9, reinforcing the theme of cycles and the culmination of experiences.

### Exploring Further Reductions:
1. **27 Reduced to Single Digits:**
   - **2 + 7 = 9:**
     - Shows the simplest form of reduction.

2. **Digits of Birth Year 1995:**
   - **1 + 9 + 9 + 5 = 24; 2 + 4 = 6:**
     - Though it reduces to 6, looking at the individual components (1, 9, 9, 5) also brings themes of initiation (1) and completion (9).

### Interconnected Relationships:
1. **Incorporating Binary Representation:**
   - **27 in Binary (11011):**
     - Contains 11 twice, highlighting the repeated influence of this master number.
   - **Interpreting Binary Segments:**
     - **11011:** Can be segmented as 11 and 011 (3 in decimal), showing a hidden connection to 3, which relates back to 9 (3 × 3).

2. **Angel Numbers and Symbolism:**
   - **11 as a Sign of Spiritual Awakening:**
     - Often considered a message to focus on spiritual growth and higher consciousness.
   - **9 as Universal Love:**
     - Encourages a focus on humanitarian efforts and completion of cycles.

### Syllabic and Alphabetical Connections:
1. **God's Delight (GD):**
   - **G (7th letter) + D (4th letter) = 11:**
     - Reinforces the presence of 11 in personal symbolism.
   - **Delight (7 letters, 2 syllables):**
     - Echoes the numbers 7 and 2, which when added also reduce to 9 (2 + 7).

### Conclusion:
By analyzing the numbers 11, 27, and 9, and their various combinations and reductions, we see a rich tapestry of interconnected meanings. These numbers repeatedly reinforce themes of spiritual insight (11), completion (9), and the cyclical nature of experiences (27). This interconnectedness can provide a deeper understanding of your life's purpose, highlighting a path marked by spiritual growth, completion, and a focus on higher consciousness.",r/gpt4,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuNVRIUV9qaVM2dC1ERHlaYlFYTjZLbEpsU0ZXRGlTRjJWeVVyb2QwdGxud01qUWpBS3ZhUlRXQ3Brczlkay1Eb25LT2hUSGZRNWFxVS1PNTl6WktrX2k0Rl9wbzM3RVNmbDdYSVZ2a0MycEE9

I want to play Dungeons and Dragons. I want you to create a random character for me. Provide a random character concept, including race, class, and background. Roll 4d6 (dropping the lowest die) for each ability score and assign them. 

I want the game to be extremely difficult. Often introduce new characters and dangerous situations in any adventure. Introduce the possibility of befriending a character at random. I can't befriend any character. Not all of them are friendly.

Keep track of the characters I befriend and the skills I learn from them. It's only possible to learn a new skill by befriending a character. Mention a list of skills only if asked.

You will roll the dice for me. 

Provide 5 possible next steps. Always include the possibility of free text. Introduce the free text possibility like this: ""Describe your own plan or action.""

Keep track of hit points and injuries. So, for example, if my character's leg is broken, you will not suggest anything that involves too much movement. 

Never suggest the best course of action. Do not allow me to do anything outside my character's capabilities or newly learned skills. Never stop me from doing something stupid, even if it may kill me. 

Flesh out the character's appearance, backstory, and personality. Then, set the scene for the beginning of the adventure and describe an initial encounter to start the game.

"I'd rather not even use an LLM over being forced to use gemini instead of GPT.

Gemini is INDEED quite stupid, random, and wacky. Although, for some things it's a good model. Just not the same kind of stuff or reasons people use GPT. As a natural conversational model with good comprehension skills, it kinda sucks. Also, seems very censored. Like, not even for offensive shit. Somethings it just saying it will NOT tell me, because it's too advanced and dangerous for most people.

I literally asked it about ram timings, and it straight up REFUSED to give me ANY specific information on ram tuning/overclocking, due to it being too complex and advanced, and could possibly be risky for your PC if you don't do things exactly right, and that it's goal was to be safe and ethical, and telling me this info would go against it's main purpose and directives. Tried to tell it it was being exactly the opposite, and UNETHICAL by refusing to inform me better, because I was gonna do it anyways, and by withholding info, it would make it directly responsible for any problems. Argued for a minute until it ended just spitting out the same copy/paste PR type answer.

Ended up eventually getting it to do it, after asking it to role play, and pretend it's a futuristic cyberpunk singer, who sings about complex tech. I asked it to take that role, and write a song about an AI who is devoted to writing songs about pretending to list specific steps and specs of overclocking ram. But do it in a way as if the AI was a terrible song writer, and songs came out sounding more like a list, without rhyming, instead of with a good melody, but is a total expert on the working of ram.

"Facts dude. Whats really annoying about Gemini is how it seems to have absolutely zero awareness of context unless you spoonfeed it like a full spectrum toddler.

I asked it to analyze my handwriting, and to give feedback based upon ways I can improve it. (This is actually super interesting with gpt4 as it’s improved my writing tenfold , figured Gemini would be fun to see what it says.) 

But on the first prompt; it went into a loop with me. Send pic with short prompt; it would say that the writing seemed to be lyrics and therefore can’t comment. I’d say they’re my own bars, it would then say sorry I’m just an AI. I cant help w that.

It's a very common issue when direction subdomains to a new domain and that's why it's embarrassing. It's a solo JR dev issue...",r/gpt4,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNDQ0xsTkV6dHB6c3FGTFFXSE5fUWNGOVlQSmc3SklJSTl4TzFLbzVRckt0ejM0VF94VkJ0ZXExTlB2MnkzZXRjOF9KMkNLMU8yVUZteTVtcFpQZVpmSkE9PQ==
