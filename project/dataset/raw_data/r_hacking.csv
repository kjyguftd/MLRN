"Well it depends, as there are many factors. All of the larger enterprises that I've consulted for had some form of baselining and deviance detection going on, as it is a relatively quick and easy win. These were environments where you'd likely see APTs attempt to employ this sort of tactic. As you go down in size into the SMB market, I frequently saw the data being collected, but not actioned on or alerted on. However, I'd argue that you're less likely to see this technique employed in those smaller SMB environments, but there are so many variables in that equation. The data transfer limitations are the big thing. Low and slow is the goal for an APT and in red team engagements, but there is such thing as too slow depending on the objectives being targeted.

This seems to be a small hacker group that hacks devices that are accessible directly in the internet, which really shouldn't be. 


When you google the name and printer you can see that even Google indexed crazy many printers, which were just sitting in the internet, waiting to be hacked 


https://www.google.com/search?q=Hacked+by+%22Aliester+Crowley%22+printer


It's impossible to say what this group did on the printer. Maybe they installed a backdoor, maybe they just added this to the display name to scare people.

"A compromised network device impacts all downstream devices. They would literally be a man-in-the-middle and have the ability to intercept or redirect all your traffic. 


Theoretically, worse case would be to install a custom firmware on the router, like OpenWRT, and gain full access to everything that passes through. In practice though, that’s less likely as those projects are not as well maintained these days.


As a goal, an attacker would use this to further compromise internal hosts. This can be done by pivoting from the router, looking for vulnerabilities on connected hosts, or poisoning internal traffic, such as DNS, and redirecting internal hosts to malicious sites.


In actuality, if someone is attacking your router from the inside, you have other problems and/or have already been compromised.",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYanVpbnA3dmdkd2ZwT2VjX01JWUxIdVg4S3BqREp4VW5wbmlpVk5HUUJWVE4wMjFGYmtqaHplTkllcXJnQ3VTbjRQT1IySTZvNkh6aThNNXg5dmlldWc9PQ==

"That's assuming you can hack the router itself.

With the given assumptions only, I think you have fewer options, especially since almost all internet traffic is encrypted, and there's nothing you can do about it.

If the router is compromised, then yeah DNS redirecting could happen if the user is configured to use ISP DNS. Even if they're using an ISP DNS, you have to get lucky enough for them to not notice the redirect and getting tipped off. Even establishing a proper mitm attack isn't a case-closed compromise on modern machines. After all, they're made with the assumption that they're being MITMed.

I suppose you could think of it another way though. If they are able to access your network as a peer, they can sniff to see which websites you're connected to. Better yet they can probably tell when the house is empty based on call phone connections and rob the place.

Edit: the question is worded weirdly. I see now that the OP is talking about the password to the admin interface. Assuming they have both the network password and the password to the router itself, then we might be able to assume something along the lines of option 2 (mitm using a proxy set up in the router perhaps + custom DNS set up in the router perhaps)",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNlhNVjlvMGtWOVhTODc2SVlQTU5od3Y5WXJRNENGNWRwa0lFeUFzVXhqVnN2eUlveU9xc0NlQXduMm9qNlpiMW9Td3pHcG1ZZ0NFRDZhTzhsX0pQeVE9PQ==

"The Wiki article shows proofs how the company lied in every single claim and demonstration of breaking RSA:

* The Q-grid method was nothing but searching over an astronomically large prime lookup-table nobody can generate or store.
* The demonstration event of Crown Sterling BiPrime algorithm was a medicine show that was just plagiarizing open source software. The 256-bit RSA key they broke was weaker than what was broken in 1991 (330-bit RSA). These days you use 3072-bit RSA to be safe.
* The Reciprocal factoring method was nothing but random trial division i.e. let's break RSA by guessing the prime factors randomly.
* The Pythagorean Factorization was just Grant plagiarizing Fermat's 400 year old factorization method, an attack that was anticipated in the paper by R, S, and A in 1978.
* The Geometric factorization didn't work, even with tiny numbers, even if you knew the factors beforehand. They didn't actually solve the equation.

It also shows the company's own cryptographic primitives are dangerous or broken. It shows

* Crown RNG used ridiculous seeding mechanisms like keyboard and mouse, and the Blum-Blum-Shub algorithm allows a back-door, and it's security is based on prime factorization problem (Which the CEO Grant claims is weak, so they're self-contradicting themselves all the time).
* The CrownEncrypt protocol used EC-Diffie Hellman and pretended it was post-quantum secure because the keys were like, really random (in fact, EC-DH is weaker than RSA against quantum computers).
* The Crown-OTP can be broken in milliseconds, and the article provides the source code and instructions for you so you can verify the claim yourself.
* The CrownEncrypt protocol didn't use any kind of message authentication code.

It shows the crypto currency is just smart contracts and parachains without any post-quantum security whatsoever.

So everything the company has done in the past is broken and scammy as fuck.

It also shows you actual source code from Orion Messenger that shows a backdoor in the code. It takes apart the Lite Paper and the White Paper draft that was shared over their Telegram, and shows how it lacks even basic things like public key fingerprints, which proves the platform is vulnerable to trivial Man-In-The-Middle attacks that have been addressed by cryptographic tools as early as the PGP emails from 1991.

The article shows proofs of the company plagiarizing existing news article. The article lists the key staff formal education and work experience and shows they have zero credentials. The best they could do was get one undergraduate math student (Naomi Mathew). In comparison, the article quotes critique by several wold renowned expert cryptographers like Bruce Schneier, Sophie Schmieg, Markku-Juhani O. Saarinen, JP Aumasson, Thomas Pornin, Mark Carney, and other industry experts like Dan Guido and Aaron Toponce.

But sure, I also would much rather take random Redditor's word who claims to ""know it's quantum secure"", who lives in denial and who mismisses hard evidence as a smear campaign when it walks all the way to them.

"Not heard of ""man on the side""

Could you mean ""side channel attack""?

A side channel attack is one where you use some data that leaks out of the system. A classic side channel attack might be listening to the buttons click on a physical combination lock, ""Open when ON"" buttons make a diffrent sound to ""Open when OFF"" buttons.

When it comes to side channel attacks in the computer world you get to some really complex shit, like monitoring the power consumption of the device when giving it different data. Or more recently we have seen timing based attacks used to work out what data is stored in the cache (which can be cross VM on a shared infrastructure).",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZTzF0bmhsZkE3VVo2S1l0clplcE5NZ3MzbTJ0YTIyTlRsSTRvTkJVbzd3OTgxUGlHZkZDMmtVUGNTSEs2bFdNRFlrNlhRRDFXSEFXYS1LNEMtV3VST0E9PQ==
"MITM means that the attack functions by inserting itself between two parties that would normally be communicating directly with one-another. This is typically achieved by pretending to be both parties by diverting traffic by some means. While I've never actually heard of MOTS attack, if I had to guess, it would mean either intercepting and/or injecting communications to manipulate the situation. I suppose that a wifi DNS cache poisoning attack, as a vector for initiating a MITM attack, could be thought of as a type of MOTS attack.

Technically, anything that *isn't* a MITM seems like it would be a MOTS attack, but that's just my naive self rambling conjecture.

"> Is the reverse engineering and the exploits discovery process just patience and waddling through code slowly until you find something?

Not just, but that's a big part of it. But as many things are, it is a skill. The more you do it, the better you'll be in it. Whether it is recognizing vulnerable patterns or understanding where you should look.

Don't forget that although vulnerabilities are found all the time, there's never a certainty they exist, or that you'll find them.

Finding vulnerabilities doesn't have to be the main way to get the sense of accomplishment, understanding the underlying code, imagining how the original code base looks, and thinking about how it was programmed.

Try to participate in CTFs (for pwn or RE challenges) or tackle some Crackme's.

"if your name is on the telephone number and your number is connected to an APP, then you can be traced by most government agencies. particularly if ur USA/EU/AUS. they can access your phone anytime they want (within legal boundaries, IE. you committed cyber crimes). 

if you want to remain anonymous on an mobile device you need to use a burner phone, the phone must be bought with cash, you should ideally not be seen buying the phone (security cameras), the SIM card cannot have your name, IE it must be prepaid and given false information when you sign up. youll also need to make sure your normal phone and the burner phone are never in the same place at the same time. they can easily tell if the two phones have been  connected to the same networks (3/4/5g towers) 

msgs are encrpyted in that outside people supposedly cant see what your typing during communication or in a saved chat file if something is intercepted. it doesnt mean your ""information is protected"" if you want your ""data protected"" you need to read the privacy policy. if you dont agree with the policy, dont use the app. 

similarly, a vpn doesnt magically hide your identity. if a government agency realy wanted to, they would find you. they can go through allll the different nodes to find which one you came from. (perhaps depends on jurisdictions in certain countries, which is why some vpn services dont have servers in certain countries) The NSA has ensured they control 99% of the end points. which is why we have specialised tools for obfuscating more information than just an ip address.

"The best I can explain with this is as follows: 

In reverse engineering. You take note of key patterns. Such as if 
xxxxxx = true then {
Send true
}

What you would then do is change it from true to false. See what happens? If what happens may be you attempt to login and it succeeds on a failed password. What you did was tell the app 
Password_correct = false then {
Send true
}

"I'm a masters student in a Cybersecurity track and the only legitimate reason I could see is research. Going through it to find statistical information about password use to say stuff like ""X percent of users used passwords found in common password lists"". Would be insightful but it should only be statistically reported and not tied to individuals or groups of individuals working at a specific organization.

I know a lot of people asked me where to find the Heritage Foundation data breach recently and I told them not to tread anywhere near it because they weren't Cybersecurity professionals and had no good excuse to be digging around that stuff. If you did want to do something research related I would treat it like a formal paper and write the abstract of what you're looking to research and define the ""why"" clearly before doing any actual scraping. Ideally you're in school in that scenario and also ideally write it up on a private GitHub repo so you have a timestamp describing your intent. If you're wanting to research  specific companies or organizations then get their permission first (or just don't do it at all).

Anything outside of that to me is very grey legally speaking.

Similar to your title, in a sense, nothing is impossible. Some things are just way harder than others. Take breaking into a car or house as an example. Are you going to choose a target that is fenced off with tons of lights, doors, sensors, etc, or are you going to choose a target with none of that? 

Same goes for hacking. No target is 100% secure, but some are stupid easy and others may take years.

"So with MITM, imagine two people, John and Mary, are talking over the phone. 

However, two phones are not directly connected to each other - they connect through a series of servers that are relaying audio signals from one device to the other like a big relay race going back and forth.

John simply assumes that what he's hearing is truly what Mary has said. However, there is always a possibility that someone controlling a server somewhere in the middle could actually be changing what is said. 

So let's say Evil Mary is intercepting the call. 

John (thinking he's talking to Mary but is really talking to Evil Mary): Hi Mary, how are you? 

Evil Mary (talking to Mary, pretending to be John): Hi Mary. How are you?

Mary (thinking she's responding to John): Oh I'm okay. 

Evil Mary (to John): Oh, I'm okay but can you send me some money to evilmary@hotmail.com?

So Evil Mary is intercepting the conversation on both sides and relaying messages back and forth, sometimes changing the message. 

With Man-On-The-Side, Evil Mary sits next to the real Mary at work. She hears Mary answer a call from John.

John: Hey Mary, can you tell me where I should send my bill payment?

Mary: Sure, one second. 

(Evil Mary quickly shouts from nearby before Mary can respond further)

Evil Mary: SEND YOUR PAYMENT TO EVILMARY@HOTMAIL.COM!!!

John: Thanks! (Hangs up the phone)

Mary: Okay. Send your payment to billing@company.com.

So Man-On-The-Side is basically where the attacker sends their own response before the real response comes back.

The person waiting for the response accepts the attacker's response because it was first, and then ignores the real response as just bad data that it didn't ask for. 

This can get complicated because more and more Internet communication is requiring a secure channel (e.g. HTTPS) where an attacker wouldn't know how to properly encrypt the response, and the attacker NEEDS to be in a position where they can send a response before the real response comes through.",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabElCSHgzbkw3Zmt2alE1eWVIanBGMnlCWVhDSFNCN3JMTE9qYzdPWlBjTmtacG5qekpOY2J1Zk5jTXhYNjllR1RfNWJ1SUtzTlF1SlpwSlVqTjMyZ1JqUmFtempiT3ByVW5JRW1aSmJHczQ9

"You can use compromised hosts, I've had some problems with people not liking the UI for upload scripts, but there's tons of random websites that aren't closely watched and have exploitable issues. You can then add a file upload script, or add your ssh key and transfer things that way (ssh has a compress option -C btw). Then since it's on a website people can just download it through a VPN.

IRL people tend to use stuff like file sharing sites a lot but those are much better for small files.

Alternate but supported protocols can be useful in exfiltrating files around firewalls, like sometimes people completely forget to filter outbound ipv6 or udp or protocols like that. IPv6 is supported by SSH and lots of networks these days.

If you're just moving stuff from your network to another there's a protocol from the bittorrent project that I thought looked promising that synchronizes folder between several machines quickly and with the ability to download from multiple places at once.

"From what I’ve heard, specialization is the way to go. It’s a competitive industry so you want to carve your niche. Get really good/knowledgeable in a specific subject (like cloud or mobile devices as you said, for instance) and put it on your resume. Anyone can learn a little about everything, but that doesn’t mean they can do anything useful. This is even more relevant today where AI will start to be used in cybersecurity, inevitably in automation of the most basic attacks. Someone who only knows the basics isn’t smart to hire if an AI and a bunch of high school students with time in their hands can do the same. If you master something, you’d be the person who helps *develop* the AI’s proficiency and would be the go-to guy for whatever subject. You’d be someone to keep around. There are lots of people who know this and that but there are only so many people who know *this specific thing* and *everything about it*.

As for the blackhats and the actual process, they’re just a different side of the same coin. A traditional cyberattack involves only one vector and only one (main) payload. If you’re getting access into a web server, you need specialization in that, and only that. If you only want to extract data from that web server, you need expertise in just that. You only need to know what you’re going to use, and the basics usually won’t get you there unless you’ve got four-leaf clovers coming out of your ears. All the famous blackhats specialize in specific kinds of hacks, whether they be social engineering or privilege escalation or what have you. Usually you’ll need to know a couple things but not all of them to be an effective hacker.

There is general knowledge you need to know; basic networking, for one. But specialization is basically the mark of a hacker. As you said, there’s too much to learn. Someone who knows everything would be unstoppable, but would also have to spend decades learning. Those in the field and those who mess around in their free time both learn, but it’s likely neither will ever learn everything (especially because of how fast the industry evolves).

TL;DR hackers specialize because it’s better for getting hired and better for running meaningful attacks, and learning everything isn’t practical or efficient.",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabmhhYkNoQWNsZzlmd1B4dXZFa21wSnNxQVpjZ0JmUG1XeWliQTJKWWd1RVhvMWdfNU1ZQWFFOGJLSVZ1dTlXTGlVNTYzV3ZxV2xsTkVYQVJrMXlMWU1OT3c5cmNCX2ZzQWhwdndzNDJaSGc9
"You start off learning as much as you can about everything, getting good at this and that; and just experiment overall.

"I can understand why you’d feel confused and concerned about this. Doxxing typically involves the malicious act of revealing someone's private information without their consent, usually to harass or intimidate them. If she only mentioned your first and last name, it might not be doxxing per se, but it’s certainly an invasion of privacy and troubling behavior.

It's important to protect yourself online. Consider tightening your privacy settings on social media, being cautious about what personal information you share, and reporting any inappropriate behavior to the platform.

"In cyber security today. Ex military, diagnosed with PTSD. I had a history. I am contracted by the government to do security audits for a variety of suppliers. I lead a team, and also hold a clearance. Mental health stigma is not a thing for any role unless you are acting unprofessional in the interview or a lunatic to your colleagues.

Dropped charges...were they dismissed or were you determined not guilty? If either, it will not show up on any background check to include an FBI. The record may exist on a public circuit court record access site, but legally, it can not be used. Just don't verbally draw attention to it, and no employer legally can not ask about it.

Story time:
8 years ago I had a Misdeamonor(A) disorderly conduct and assault with a deadly weapon convictions and then a restraining order against me because a man was snapping photos of my then 6 year old daughter; guy was later convicted for it and is now sitting 15 years in prison. It took nearly 3 years to get my reputation back, given how slow criminal law works. My employer at the time was understanding.

What I did to earn such a trophy was had an urge, an overwhelming compel, to break all of his fingers with his phone and to see if the myth was true if tonsils were a sort of universal charging dock. Hospitalized the guy for almost a month. Not my brightest moment as that phone's contents were what set me free. Data forensics was able to recover just enough to prove my complaint and found 3 other girls he did this to beyond my daughter.

5 years ago, the charge was dismissed in my petition to strike the record as the judge determined I would not have done this, that it was a passion crime, given the prick was charged with multiple accounts of child pornography.

I hope that satisfies your answer, given that my situation was worse than yours.",r/hacking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnR1lGemNmNUd6NGpmTnRmQnF4TWFqcjlMc1M1RVJhbVNOa2Jub2VjZVFoektiMUdRSElnczVuSTFlX1lVZ3gtZGNWTUdWNmotVlJQRVdvc0xEanhmYWc9PQ==

Regardless of my feelings, there's this thing called fair use. Copyright law is really complex and subjective. But, under a number of circumstances, it's legit. I've had this discussion many times.

(And I don't know that much, but I've spent a lifetime - literally - being somehow involved in it, etc.)

But, to finally answer your question, try searching ""reverse image search"". Also, tools like Photoshop - and I believe also open source alternatives - let you put an invisible ""watermark"" on the image. Unfortunately I don't know how (or if) that works in detail but I know many who use it for their professional work.
