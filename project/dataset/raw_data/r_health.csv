"They added an exception to a law that was written in the early '50s to prevent members of the ku Klux Klan wearing masks to hide their identity as they paraded their racist agendas. They added an exception to the rule during COVID for health reasons. Now they are striking through that exception and making it clearer that people cannot use masks to disguise themselves when they are causing trouble by protesting, blocking the roads, committing crimes or for otherwise nefarious purposes. There is no intention of enforcing the statute for people who use the mask for health reasons. It would be highly, highly unlikely for somebody to be charged with only wearing a mask. And if by some reason that person was charged for only wearing a mask, the prosecutor would not prosecute the case. And if they did, a simple note from a doctor would be all the defense that person would need and then the state would be out an awful lot of money for harassment and violation of their civil rights. 

The headlines surrounding this law has been unnecessarily clickbaity.

The law isn't meant to be prosecuted as a stand alone offense. It's going to be prosecuted as an add-on charge when some madman bombs a Jewish temple under the guise of protesting. Much like one cannot be pulled over in a traffic stop solely for not wearing a seatbelt. However, if one is pulled over for evading the police and they're not wearing a seatbelt, they will get a ticket for it and it will be enforced. 

No state prosecutor is going to charge someone with wearing a medical mask for medical purposes. The ACLU would have a heyday and the person prosecuted would be a millionaire. The DA would be ridiculed and lose their job. But if a madman does bomb a Jewish temple and he's wearing a mask, he'll be prosecuted for it.

"The article is a little misleading.

Wegovy and its brethren from Novo use the *base* form of the medically active ingredient semaglutide in its Wegovy/Ozempic/Rybelsus products.

Compounders are using a conjugate salt of semaglutide, and NOT the base form. Important note, Novo chose the *base* form over the conjugate *salt*, for it's Wegovy/Ozempic and Rybelsus products.

So the salt form is pharmacologically a different active ingredient than the FDA approved drug, which contain the base form of semaglutide. And there have been no peer reviewed clinical trials conducted on the salt form to determine safety and efficacy.

Amongst other issues, it's believed the molecular size/weight of the salt form presents absorption issues/difficulties, not evidenced with the base form of semaglutide.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTT0RRSHlJZV9ybkI1NndnemMzQTc3TlZfNzdBYlYwMnREM2F6amFXSHJ6ZjhPNzhkaFFhMXNFUW5CLWNocGlRMEVveVotV09JQ0lGSDE3aDFrdXd4dWh3NmxQbzhjSFRsclpuVjEwU2dnM1U9

"**From the article:**

Fourteen years ago, a journalist named Melanie Reid attempted a jump on horseback and fell. The accident left her mostly paralyzed from the chest down. Eventually she regained control of her right hand, but her left remained “useless,” she told reporters at a press conference last week. 

Now, thanks to a new noninvasive device that delivers electrical stimulation to the spinal cord, she has regained some control of her left hand. She can use it to sweep her hair into a ponytail, scroll on a tablet, and even squeeze hard enough to release a seatbelt latch. These may seem like small wins, but they’re crucial, Reid says.

“Everyone thinks that \\[after\\] spinal injury, all you want to do is be able to walk again. But if you’re a tetraplegic or a quadriplegic, what matters most is working hands,” she said.

Reid received the device, called ARCex, as part of a 60-person clinical trial. She and the other participants completed two months of physical therapy, followed by two months of physical therapy combined with stimulation. The results, [published today in Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02940-9), show that the vast majority of participants benefited. By the end of the four-month trial, 72% experienced some improvement in both strength and function of their hands or arms when the stimulator was turned off. Ninety percent had improvement in at least one of those measures. And 87% reported an improvement in their quality of life.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTQ2ZXZERuckladGJDS0kzd2M5bi0taHNraDBMR0pSUWZSbzM5cFd5VlFXVHlqRXZOdmp1WmNsYzBwZWVkVl9hVnEtWXhRUk9CbGhpck9PMTBEMjlnMFE9PQ==

"The law isn't meant to be prosecuted as a stand alone offense. It's going to be prosecuted as an add-on charge when some madman bombs a Jewish temple under the guise of protesting. Much like one cannot be pulled over in a traffic stop solely for not wearing a seatbelt. However, if one is pulled over for evading the police, they're going to be prosecuted for it. 

No state prosecutor is going to charge someone with wearing a medical mask for medical purposes. The ACLU would have a heyday and the person prosecuted would be a millionaire. The DA would be ridiculed and lose their job. But if a madman does bomb a Jewish temple and he's wearing a mask, he'll be prosecuted for it.

"""Interesting you cite the differences in form. Is the different form unrestricted by patent..""

- yes, because the conjugate form (semaglutide salt) is sold for research purposes only and not FDA approved for human consumption.

""or are they using the different form because the actual manner Wegovy constructs the medicine is too complex or expensive likely?""

- expensive and unavailable. Novo Nordisk holds the patent on semaglutide, and the drug maker DOES NOT supply the ingredient to outside groups, leaving some experts wondering what exactly is being sold to consumers. This is where the suspicion that they're using/selling a conjugate stems from. And several States have already begun cracking down on compounding pharmacies for using a non FDA approved form of semaglutide in their Wegovy/Ozempic knockoffs. See [(link)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-compounded-crackdowns-rcna82405). Additionally Novo themselves have successfully brought multiple lawsuits against compounding pharmacies for patent infringement. See [(link)](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/novo-nordisk-settles-two-lawsuits-copycat-versions-ozempic-wegovy-rcna138075). And late last year, Novo Nordisk said that it had conducted tests on compounded products allegedly being sold as semaglutide from two Florida pharmacies as part of their lawsuits against compounders. One sample, the drug maker claimed, had a level of *unknown* impurities of 33%. Another sample had lower levels of the active ingredient than described on the label, along with *impurities*, according to a separate lawsuit. The FDA has not approved any compounded from of semaglutide and has issued warnings about counterfeit Wegovy/Ozempic. See [(link)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/medications-containing-semaglutide-marketed-type-2-diabetes-or-weight-loss#:~:text=Has%20FDA%20found%20illegally%20marketed,distribution%20of%20illegally%20marketed%20semaglutide.)

Chan School of Public Health. “Therefore, we should focus on solutions to reduce indoor air pollution to try to protect children, pregnant women, the elderly, adults, and public health in general.”

I mean, Covid is an infinitely more deadly interior air threat, but we did absolutely nothing to improve indoor air quality mechanisms. Authorities even went out of their way to avoid declaring it airborne until rig it after the emergency order ended.

"Yup! There was also a study that said that fats and oils break down plastics faster, so things like Mayo and olive oil also have a higher rate of garbage in them. We’ve started to learn canning just so we can grow a few things ourselves and put them in glass instead of pfa coated cans and plastics. Plus it just tastes better. It’s time intensive for a day or two, so prepare for it to be your weekend. But it also allows you to bulk buy which does end up cheaper long term. 

For example we made about ten cans of stew for a total of $3/can. Another thing we do is roast a whole chicken and freeze the meat in portions. Shredded is great for breakfast omelettes, chicken salad, sprinkled on a regular salad, in your Mac and cheese, etc. plus we can then boil the bones/skin etc to make chicken stock which we can and store for other recipes. 

I’m going on a tangent but seriously if you have the time, growing and canning in general are fantastic. Tastes so much fresher than store bought cans and saves you time cooking after a long day. Oh also, if you can veggies you can use the scraps for a compost heap to help fertilize more crops. We don’t have a lot of space but there is a patch behind the garage and a patch in the front of the house we can fit a couple planters. We’ve got green beans and squash going (three sisters method sans corn, the beans add nitrates to the soil, the corn (or pole) give the beans something to climb, and the squash keeps weeds away with its broad leaves-and saves space grown together)",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN2o2REo2R281T3Z0OE1JaGdKQWsyZXZ1Ri05VEpvWUgyTENlOXFrWE1haVdEbENEdUQ1RE1laGNoNXF1Y0ZwdTBkX0VwMHRQZHJMYnpNTDVFRmZvaXc9PQ==

"I think it doesn’t have to be 800,000 years, there are genetic conditions arising and spreading and genetic anomalies happening all the time, modern humans have only existed for around 200,000 years, and blue eyes came from a single individual 6,000 to 10,000 years ago, and now so many people have blue eyes, even though blue eyes are recessively inherited. Fair skin in modern humans isn’t that old either, may be even more recent than blue eyes. So changes can happen and spread over a much much shorter time than 800,000 years. There may even be an individual alive or two who may have some kind of gene that happens to do better than average with microplastics who may pass it down to their kids, like maybe they are just more resistant, and if microplastics really do significantly reduce sperm count and if that count continues to worsen, who knows, but I hope to God we stop using so much plastic by that point. Also the person you replied to didn’t say anything about filtering it out, but just adapting to it, though even more extreme such as ‘needing’ it, which seems so unlikely to me.. however there are bacteria that eat plastic, so if there was a probiotic that we could take that could live in the microbiome or if someone had a bacteria that could eat plastic already in their microbiome then that would be helpful to get rid of it in the blood.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTVkljRGtwNkxfQllnNm9OREhCUHU0V1BDU1h2MXh6R2dkcVJ4Sk9MT0xMQ1F0MzU0UnRFRUJCVXNrcWVMamtDTEQ0c3FkYUZXaGFiM2RZUDZMdy14enBiLVk4WTR4alUtT1hPS29TSFdtTlk9

"Your comment got me thinking about bioremediation.. there are scientists who work with bacteria that eat plastic. They think this bacteria only naturally evolved since we started using plastic. If such a bacteria evolved outside the body, surely one may evolve in the human gut at some point in an individual, I don’t see why it isn’t possible. The microbiome is quite sensitive to what we eat. Also what if we could ingest this bacteria or if scientists could genetically alter it to make it a safe probiotic to take or something if it isn’t safe to take already or if it wouldn’t survive stomach acid or something, genetically altered it to survive in our guts.

Im sure everyone has seen the movie/book trope: humans infertile, mass hysteria, blah blah blah. Then she asked how. How? At some point there must be too much plastic within our bodies for them to function properly. Its the inevitability of overusage: too much of a good thing is a bad thing.

"By Pandora Dewan - Senior Science Reporter:

Scientists have detected ""significant concentrations"" of microplastics in tissue form human testicles, raising concerns about their effects on reproductive health.

Microplastics refer to any plastics that are less than 5 millimeters (0.2 inches) in length. The plastic particles have been found in our food, water, air and even in human placenta.

"It's linked from the article. I just skimmed through it. It's summarizing meta-analyses which compare people eating vegetarian/vegan diets to everyone else. They specifically exclude studies that mention other diets like the Mediterranean diet. They specifically exclude interventional studies that might answer causal questions. So it's asking a question I doubt many people interested in health actually care about: are people eating vegetarian or vegan diets healthier than the average non-vegetarian? Unsurprisingly, the answer is yes. 

Are they healthier than diets which include meat and are designed to be healthy or have research to back them like Mediterranean, DASH, MIND, etc.? Not addressed by the study. Are they healthier than high meat diets like keto, paleo, etc.? Not addressed by the study. If you switch people to a vegetarian/vegan diet, does that make them healthier than doing nothing or switching to another diet? Not addressed by the study.

I'm sure the study is competently done, but it's hard for me to imagine why it was written.

- **Avian Influenza Hits Antarctica:** A deadly strain of bird flu has reached Antarctica, causing unprecedented mass deaths among unique wildlife such as Adélie penguins and skuas.
  
- **Mass Mortality Events:** Large numbers of birds are found dead on the ice, with rows of Adélie penguins and skuas marking a ""trail of destruction"".

- **Global Spread Concerns:** The mutating virus, identified as HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, has been spreading globally, affecting bird and mammal species, with fears it could reach Australia.

- **Scientific Expedition Findings:** A recent disease surveillance expedition led by Dr. Meagan Dewar from Federation University Australia revealed the grim situation with numerous bird species suddenly dying.

- **Transmission Theories:** The virus is believed to have been brought to Antarctica by skuas from the sub-Antarctic islands, which contracted it from South America where the disease has devastated local wildlife.

- **Potential Impact on Australia:** Scientists worry the virus could spread to Australia during the migratory season starting in September, with significant risks to biodiversity and the poultry industry.

- **Australian Preparedness:** Despite increased biosecurity measures, the Australian government and scientists acknowledge an outbreak seems inevitable but emphasize readiness and monitoring to mitigate impact.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUV2FrRkwyLTVObUdnbjNvZUtKdUV6WFdjZ3FxRzZxZkY1b2pNSTk4VlJRckc0YWxkNWZBS0FYbjlRZFkzampxdmhqUkJzV2hIN2ROVWVKSUc0Q05lS3c9PQ==

"""Norvo has a lot of interest in finding “impurities” in 3rd party product :). I take that with a grain of salt perhaps as they are trying to protect the business.""

- while i can appreciate your position, I'm careful given it's not just Novo reporting quality issues with compounders, it's also the FDA reporting it. I've provided you a link to a news release from the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (a licensure authority) advising member pharmacies that counterfeit products containing zero active ingredients or ingredients of questionable provenance/quality resulting in adverse events, have been found in the U.S. weight loss drug market. So is it possible Novo totally fabricated their claim, i suppose it could be if they did the testing in house and not via an independent 3rd party lab willing to put their name on the report. I just don't know enough about that to render an opinion one way or another, so in light of that I'm inclined to take Novo's word at face value given the FDA is likewise reporting quality issues with compounders. So it's not [just] Novo saying it, it's the FDA as well...

"I saw in another thread here that maybe my comment above is being misinterpreted. This study being weak evidence does not imply that the overall evidence for plant-based diets is weak. As far as I\\[\\*\\] can tell, it's very strong. Some plant based diets are probably [as good or better than the Mediterranean Diet](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07315724.2020.1869625). In addition to saturated fat, there is emerging evidence that animal protein specifically may be worse for longevity than plant protein due to its amino acid composition and reduced IGF hormone response to plant protein. 

FWIW, I am personally moving my diet towards a whole-food plant-based diet, though it's challenging with a family that doesn't also want to make that dietary shift.

\\[\\*\\] I am a nerd who reads a lot about nutrition, but I'm not a scientist or MD, so obviously my opinion on what the overall evidence says should not carry very much weight.

"To a point, you are not wrong. 

If you have a stroke in the DR and are medically stable, your US health insurance typically won’t pay for a medical plane to get you home. It’s a tad SOL kinda situation.

"This is some additional info that I found.

From ABC NewsRadio (Australia):

The child returned to Australia from overseas in March, became unwell and subsequently tested positive. 

Dr. Clare Looker, Victoria's Chief Health Officer, said: 

>It was only identified over the weekend. The confirmation testing just came in, I think it was late on Sunday [May 19]. The priority was making sure that the child and family were aware.

>Audio clip: https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/news-specials/victorian-child-returning-to-australia-tests-positive-for-bird-f/103881350

Other info:

>The case occurred in a child, who acquired the infection in India and was unwell in March 2024. The avian influenza virus was detected through further testing of positive influenza samples that takes place to detect novel or concerning flu virus strains, as part of Victoria’s enhanced surveillance system. Contact tracing has not identified any further cases of avian influenza connected to this case.

>There are lots of different subtypes (strains) of avian influenza. Most of them don’t infect humans. Some subtypes, including H5N1, are more likely to cause disease and death in poultry. These are known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses. Significant outbreaks of HPAI viruses are being reported in poultry and non-poultry birds and mammals overseas. The United States of America is currently experiencing outbreaks of HPAI (H5N1) in dairy cows, with one recent human case in a dairy worker. Whilst the Victorian case is HPAI (H5N1), it is not the same as the strains that have caused these outbreaks in the United States of America.

"Hi, i’m from Spain. my dad got infected around this same time with an American strain of Hep C, he passed 11 years ago. Hep C is very hard to transmit, it used to be due to a medical procedure. I am awaiting his clinical history. Apart from Spain he was in Cologne during his military service, which is hard for me to get info about. 

Any ideas how can I get info regarding exports and imports of blood products from the USA? They exported prison blood to the whole world but only the UK has actually uncovered the truth, my guess is because of the large amount of haemophiliac kids treated there, but this also affected other patients…. 

How can I reach out to the UKs affected family’s lawyers to see if they have info? 
Where can I find blood products records including imports and exports? 
Where can I find the records of USA’s exported blood for these decades? I cant even find any records from the Arkansas prison exports “scandal”.

Good news: scientists might have found a way to make chocolate a bit healthier, a new study reports.

Chocolate is made from the cocoa fruit by extracting cocoa mass and cocoa butter but there are actually many ingredients in the cocoa fruit that go unused.

"I despise the ""But muh genes!"" stuff.

But I have to say that I am frustrated by the ""It's behavioral!"" smugness too.  First, behavior is not independent of genes (ie, you can inherit genes that predispose you to certain behaviors). Secondly, genetics interact with the environment. True, our genes haven't changed that much over the past 50 years, but our environment sure has. By a whole lot.  The chemical stew we are swimming in is super different than what our grandparents and great-grand parents contended with.  Some of us have a genetic profile that can handle this bombardment with no apparent issues.  But many people cannot.  The ultraprocessed foods they are consuming along with all the PFAS, BPAs, PCBs, PAHs, and microplastics are likely fucking their shit up. For some folks, their brains may be the thing that gets fucked up and their impulse control becomes diminished.  For other folks, maybe it is their endocrine system that shits the bed, resulting in metabolic issues that promote obesity (like elevated cortisol levels).

I am descended from people who didn't have any need for the lactase enzyme since they didn't consume dairy on the regular. But I live in a place and time where dairy is everywhere. I can avoid it, of course. But I like cheese and ice cream. So I eat these things well-aware that I am genetically predisposed to digestive problems.  Fortunately for me, a little gas and bloating is all I have to worry about. If my gassiness genetic? Or is it behavioral?

I have no doubt in my mind that people are walking around ""consuming"" things passively and intentionally that their bodies can't handle that well, due to their unique combination of genes. Are lots of people fat simply because they eat way too much junk? Of course.  But I think there are lots of people who are obese who wouldn't be as obese if we were in a pristine environment. Our genes did not evolve in the landscape we are currently living in. So it is no wonder that we have conditions and disorders that weren't super prevalent back in the day.

We can preach personal responsibility without ignoring this basic fact.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJUM21YdHdfcU1KamI0aVNWamp5a3ZoV2tkNDYxYVY3aHZkVkRqZGdJSFlOZ0w1SEtjUUZQWWJ3ZGZuRG9WQlBQZ3pRaUlKcU9HWmhMcVVveGdFT2NtZVE9PQ==

"When I started Mounjaro for my diabetes, all I felt like eating was beef jerky. Home made of course. I naturally went carnivore(less side effects that way) and I think it has allowed me to be on less medication. My CGM confirms that my blood sugar is under control at a lower dose. A1c is 4.5.

I used to think these ""1500 calories is fine"" people were insane, then here I am sitting pretty at 160 6'2"" with 10% body fat, I'm moderately active, and I have a good amount of muscle and not losing or gaining any weight eating like 1700 a day. I think the big issue is nobody realizes how many calories they are taking in and they give themselves way too much credit for the calories they burn. You don't need that many calories unless you are exercising to match it. Our bodies are efficient. 1 maybe 2 lbs of ground beef is all I need. My medication allows me to eat until i'm satiated like a normal person, then my blood sugar doesn't spike. I love it. I know its not for everyone, but for me, it was the missing key. I feel so much better than I did when my diabetes was unmanaged. Regardless of the medication, I still had to count every single calorie. I used a food scale and apple watch, and accounting for discrepancy, CICO was spot on for me. I still had to tell myself to not overeat, but my brain wasn't like ""f your diet i'm starving to death."" Also not being on a blood sugar roller coaster has me feeling good both mentally and physically, and I have no cravings for sweets. I can look at pictures of cake all day and i'm happy with ground beef.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVcmp4M21pVkVDX2NoMlBTOG1nTHVld0lXRDRRVlRqM1NZUS00RTQtRG9HakJYWnRLYllhM0VmZmR5WEloeGxId3psVUhqbkxURDRDeXAzQ1pPZE9GTDZiOXgwWW5lWWE5blZ1X2h0dHBSMnM9

"Meh. Even they are hesitant to make that conclusion.

*Although the study identified an association between an 8-hour eating window and cardiovascular death, this does not mean that time-restricted eating caused cardiovascular death.”
Study details and background:

The study included approximately 20,000 adults in the U.S. with an average age of 49 years.
The study included data for NHANES participants who were at least 20 years old at enrollment, between 2003-2018, and had completed two 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires within the first year of enrollment.*

*The study’s limitations included its reliance on self-reported dietary information, which may be affected by participant’s memory or recall and may not accurately assess typical eating patterns.*

So as young as 20 but average age is 49? How old was the higher end? 
Self-reported dietary information? Yeah that’s sound data…

*Factors that may also play a role in health, outside of daily duration of eating and cause of death, were not included in the analysis.*

So they literally could have consumed sugar for 8 hours which causes cardiovascular issues leading to death but let’s blame the eating window…",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVWXNCRE5QRXo3TGktaDVRZWlMX2FFTTctUXhWUXM0NHBKdDlpYk5odk5CRmlGVnhib08xVmFJRWlMYy0wa3J6VTRHbExHMlY3Qi11VlA3MXBiUHcwOEE9PQ==

"*Ultraprocessed foods have been linked to poor health and early death.* [*A new study*](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html) *bolsters those findings by showing a link to stroke and cognitive decline.*

>Eating more ultraprocessed foods is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline and stroke, even if a person is trying to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet or the MIND diet, a new study found.

>All three diets are plant-based, focused on consuming more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds while limiting sugar, red meat and ultraprocessed foods.

>“If you increased your ultraprocessed food intake by 10% in the study, it increased your risk of cognitive impairment by 16%,” said cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.

>“You can always extrapolate and say, ‘Well, if someone increases their ultraprocessed food consumption by 100%, then they have 160% chance of cognitive impairment,’” he said. “Of course, this study can only show an association, not a direct cause and effect.”

>On the flip side, eating more unprocessed or minimally processed foods was linked with a 12% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to the study [published Wednesday](https://n.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209432) in the journal Neurology.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJVSktGU2ZOVzI3M3RTRm1GLW5yeDVndTR4Q1RMYXV1NzRoMTFfcEc0YURBdF8xZFNKbWxlUE4xYTBlcHdFNnp0Qkw0Z1Q1SndUOXVKbXg3YmgxNVJHNmc9PQ==

"Weight loss is the most significant factor associated with T2D. This is why I made sure to say those diets may help, as any diet that will result in weight loss can help reverse T2D. 

Research shows a correlation with red meat (controlling for confounding factors, like obesity) and T2D in the long-term, and even stronger link between red meat and diseases like heart disease and colon cancer. 

I personally enjoy red meat and have it on occasion, but just want to give the evidence-based research we have so others can then make a decision based on that. It’s likely okay in moderation for most.

"Mounjaro mostly imitates the gastric inhibitory peptide. In people who have insulin and leptin resistance, this mechanism has been desensitized and this is why its so hard to lose weight once you have diabetes. Your body is death throws fighting to make you eat. Leptin is king of satiety, and if its not working right, ghrelin will come through like a T-rex and make you feel like you are actually starving to death regardless of the amount of food you eat.

When you take mounjaro, It ""docks"" more insulin, which means its ready to go so when you get a simple sugar blood sugar spike, it comes right down. Then it helps your pancreas to produce more insulin to keep the second spike from the complex carbohydrates lower. This lower blood sugar keeps you from experiencing the roller coaster effect which can make everything worse. When you get your blood sugar down, eventually you need to make less insulin, and you insulin sensitivity slowly begins to get better. Insulin blocks leptin from binding to receptors in the brain telling you that your fat cells are full. This is why when you fast you can go indefinitely. Insulin goes down and the leptin your fat cells produce tells you that you have plenty of energy stored. Oxidative damage from insulin resistance also damages the smooth ER in the hypothalamus that is crucial for hunger signaling pathways.

GIP also binds to a receptor in the gut that tells you that you are full. For people who are leptin resistant, this will be merely baseline. For someone who is not leptin resistant, they might feel very full and sick. This is why its hard for people to agree on the matter. It is perspective. For those who are sick, this medicine is life. **Nobody hears about the food noise, the borderline schizotypal thoughts of food.** Mounjaro fixes this. This pause in hunger gives you the ability to get your eating habits under control and you begin to naturally make smarter diet choices as you only crave nutrient dense foods and not filler.

The combination of all of these things gets your hormones back down from super-physiological levels and allows your body to heal. Your blood sugar comes down, your insulin comes down, the food noise stops, the ""addiction"" goes away, its a win win. Anyone who has ""tried everything"" and can't seem to make it work should really give this medication a second thought.

The reduction in insulin allows your body to use the circulating fat in your blood so it doesn't make multiple laps around your body and get the proteins oxidized, making oxLDL(bad). LDL itself is not bad, it is the primary energy source of the body when we are not dominated by insulin. it is the constant consumption of sugar and insulin spikes that keeps it in circulation long enough to get damaged. If we just fasted we could avoid so much circulatory disease. Diabetes, obesity, nephropathy, neuropathy, macular degeneration, lipidemia, and arteriosclerosis. They are all diseases of high blood sugar and high insulin.

"A jury in Chicago rejected an Illinois woman’s claim that the now discontinued heartburn drug Zantac caused her colon cancer, in the first trial out of thousands of lawsuits making similar allegations.

 

The jury in Cook County, Illinois circuit court agreed with arguments from drugmakers GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim that the plaintiff, 89-year-old Illinois resident Angela Valadez, had not proven her colon cancer was at least in part caused by her Zantac use.

 

Valadez had alleged that her cancer was a result of taking over-the-counter Zantac and generic versions of it from 1995 to 2014. The lawsuits over the drug say its active ingredient, ranitidine, under some conditions turns into a cancer-causing substance called NDMA.

 

Attorneys for Valadez had asked the jury to award $640 million for her suffering. The judge rejected Valadez's request to seek punitive damages during the trial, according to her attorneys.

Fostering can be free but it the end goal of fostering is unification of the birth family or family members. It’s temporary most of the time. Folks who want kids to reside with them permanently will have a difficult time with fostering  if they made an attachment with the child and now they have to give that child back. Fostering also required one to take a lot parenting classes. A child with higher level of care will require even more classes and qualifications. 

Plus, being placed in foster care is traumatic on its own. Many  kids in foster care will have suffered trauma and have serious abandonment issues even before being taken away.

"I work at a pharmacy and I gotta say, please don’t ask your doctor for any of these “weight loss” drugs unless you fall into one of the indicated groups (morbidly obese, diabetic). They will make you sick, literally, and have lasting effects on your body (including your organs not just your gut) if you use them when you don’t technically need them. Patients that are just regular fat like me (overweight but not morbidly obese) call in all the time complaining about how ozempic makes them nauseous all the time and they can’t keep anything down…yea dude. That’s how the “rapid weight loss” happens. It’s prescribed bulimia basically. 

All the pharmacists hate this drug and it’s not just because there’s at least 3 “Karen” types a day that call and bitch on the phone about when their prescription is coming in (demand is way higher than supply) but it’s been back ordered since March. It’s because of the health effects on patients too. How it makes them miserable and we all know that they could’ve achieved the weight loss a healthier way. It’s just slower doing it the healthy way and harder bc it requires firm discipline. It’s, on the surface, much easier to just poke yourself once a week or whatever with a needle and loose the weight that way.

"I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it appears that you aren't taking into account how important the many other variables are that make losing weight hard, besides ""people need to adhere to their diet better."" Because sure, that's true, but it's much more complex than that. Hormones, genetics, mental health, neuridivergence, income, upbringing, education, and geographical location are things that can make it *way, way* harder for some people to stick to a healthy diet. 

Food noise combined with trauma can make people incredibly dependent upon food to cope with life, and that often starts young. If your only comfort in life has been sweets, and you were never taught how to regulate your emotions, then ice cream is going to feel like a more accessible solution to difficult feelings.

"This is only kind of true. Most children whose parents are unable to care for them would be best cared for by another relative or community member rather than a stranger. Of the approximately 115,000 kids in the US whose parents have had their rights terminated and who were not adopted by next of kin, most are large sibling groups, children with serious medical issues, and older teens with severe behavioral issues. Of course they all deserve a loving family, but most people are not financially or emotionally equipped to parent children with that level of need. There ARE a lot of kids living in poverty both domestically and globally whose parents are pressured or coerced into either forfeiting those children to the state or essentially selling them to richer, usually whiter people via private adoption agencies, which is a very different and much more troubling issue.

"Definitely. People should absolutely have mental health care provided for them as needed, and in this context a good physician should at least be able to figure out what each person needs. Their recommendations could be helping someone reconsider their relationship with food.


But it seems to me the majority of people who are obese are not extreme cases in the sense that it's the outcome of trauma or hormone imbalances. If that is the case they need individualized treatment plans. But I think, and I could be wrong, the 30% or so of obese people aren't especially mentally ill or suffering in that regard. What's changed isn't the people, it's the food around us. Unless somehow we have more incidents of trauma induced food addiction? Now again, I could be wrong so if you have specific data I'll take a look. But you're right, people are now surrounded by terrible choices.


But I do believe, on some level, even when  it's hard, a person has to decide, do I buy a 2 liter of coke or bananas and kiwis and drink tap water. I get it, income is a major factor. That's why I fully support basic income, subsidized healthy food restaurants as common as McDonald's and taco bells, etc.


But I do believe that we cannot remove personal responsibility from the equation, no matter how hard it is. Because on some level, I don't want to teach children that they cannot control their emotions and desires. We must teach them how, and help them make smarter food choices **and** change the environment fundamentally.


All schools need to have healthy, nutritious, tasty, and hopefully local food. But we still need to get people physically active. Reintroduce national fitness programs so all people can be strong and fast and fit.


Even if there's no gym around, almost everyone has access to free workout videos on YouTube you can do at home. 


Basically anyone, no matter how poor their diet, could reduce their caloric intake. But it will not be easy. And many will fail.


And that's why I'm absolutely not opposed to ozempic when a physician, given a proper assessment of all the factors, has determined that for this individual person this is the best decision.


I hope that came across as sensible as it was in my head. I would never blame anyone for a food addiction, but I also would not absolve them of their free will to do something about.

Being a part of the local government would also have the most impact on your community, writing to legislatures with findings from the health department is a good step to make change. It's unfortunate to hear that the police voluntarily chose not to receive narcan training, but our county had some resistance too. But with an adequate case built on facts, most people can be convinced to pass it. And an important point from our harm reduction coordinator: everyone wants people with substance use disorders to recover, but people can't recover if they are dead.

Wegovy is just a hormonal ""full"" button, but it makes all the difference. I imagine it is helping a condition that's not named yet, where obesity is the symptom. I've been on medication that lowers appetite and it's amazing how easy it is to lose weight. You don't need to follow a diet or do a food log. And neither do skinny people.

"I don’t disagree with you at all. Still, given that the goal of anyone trying to have children is to *have children*, it seems like a logical next step. If you want babies so badly, and can’t have your own, via whatever method, then adoption can be a valid and fulfilling way to achieve the dream of becoming a parent. I think that’s where a lot of people giving that “advice” are coming from.

Adoption/fostering isn’t an easy, no-brainer answer to infertility, in any way however. Hell, having children - regardless of the manner you have them - is not a “no big deal” event in one’s life.

"Those people do not understand the reality of adopting. There are virtually no infants/ babies or even children under 5 that need homes and that that are available are usually profoundly disabled and drug addicted. Older children are much more common but they also have substantial trauma/disability/behavioral issues. Most people are not experienced enough to handle a child with that level of need. I’ve worked for years with children up for adoption and I couldn’t handle it, I’d also probably be turned away because I’ve never parented a child. 

Foster care is not “getting a child” it is being a temporary home for a child being reunited with their families or other relatives.

My food noise is *still* hardly a factor anymore, and I continue to lose 10-15 pounds every single month. I have NEVER been able to intentionally lose weight in my life, not a single pound. But all of a sudden, I lost 100 like it was nothing. And it's because obesity is a major hormonal imbalance at its source--not a moral failing--which Mounjaro addresses effectively.

I *so* agree with you that obesity is a symptom of a much larger disorder (metabolic syndrome). The hormonal imbalances worsen with every pound you gain, which in turn makes you gain even faster, a negative feedback loop that can be so hard to pull yourself out of. We haven't come close to understanding obesity, and you really can't understand how much a hold it has over you, physically and especially mentally, until you've suffered through it. It's why I always cringe at people who say ""bro just stop eating so much"" because it's clear that they simply don't understand.

Mounjaro genuinely feels like a miracle drug for chronically obese folks. It seems to improve every single facet of metabolic syndrome: food noise, hormone imbalances, inflammation, high cholesterol, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, heart disease, and even dementia risks. It's allowed so many people to have hope in a way they never thought possible... yet, none of us can afford it.

But of course, people will continue to call obese people lazy hedonists, when we know for a fact that it IS an extremely complex disease that affects every single system in the body, that it's also highly related to mental health/trauma, and that hormonal imbalances and food noise can make it extremely difficult to cut calories. It really isn't a matter of willpower--it's much deeper and more complicated than that.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWeUNKVzZTLWl5M0VLdXBoNmpESzVBUWJOWTU4WDJqMFg1Y2VzLUhDTUtDdEJIcFBqc19NekVEOUctUWlmS0txaTIyZzJyeEpIdk1kTmNCRXpuOVJpRGc9PQ==

"I would just like to say while cold water immersion therapy is still in its relative infancy when it comes to clinical data there is ROBUST data about the benefits of HEAT specifically saunas. Even as far back as Archimedes ""Eureka"" (as well as the lesser known but frankly fucking valuable knowledge that specific intervals of heat can render people temporarily infertile) but much more recently we discovered the potency of heat shock proteins. For thousands of years people have been using heat to treat various maladies and even *your own body* uses heat (fever) to kill pathogens. Not only this but unlike icebaths and cold water plunges saunas and hot tubs actually feel good. I think the whim hoff stuff is intriguing and I also think some of it is woo.

"Gotta love people dismissing things they don't understand. 

We need more research into the causative side of ADHD, as far as I'm aware, correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the ""low dopamine"" theory still not fully proven?

Do we know 100% that there's no learned aspect to ADHD?

And once we've ruled that out, the next is, is there something environmental causing it, microplastics, exposure to certain drugs or chemicals during gestation.

Or are we just looking at a situation where this is the actual distribution of ADHD once we begin correctly diagnosing it, and maybe our lifestyle just isn't suited for people with a brain focused on short term reward seeking, and you can't just sit 10% of the population in a room for 10 hours a day and expect them to succeed the same way the other 90% do.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWU295anlyRWdadEtPVS1DUXZ2Vk1MQ1VHaW42QmdwN25fay05Sm5xR0FPb0JiRzdycW50U0xNTWhJQllwUHY4dFpKZE85MnRSVTh4TGZmYjRkQUhkdC0zQ09kc25MS29laGRZU0I5VkxPQzg9

Researchers have made a breakthrough that could represent a major step forward in making the male ""pill"" a reality.

The Baylor College of Medicine's Center for Drug Discovery's research focused on a compound that can inhibit a particular protein crucial for fertility in males. The compound can target the protein, thus impeding sperm mobility, the researchers said.

"By the point they realised I had it, it was too late to shift the weight I had gained, and I’m now 29 with an endocrinologist who can’t pinpoint why my thyroid is still slingshotting TSH values around. 

Between that and PCOS onset at puberty, 
it’s been brutal to deal with my own body fighting me and the shame from my peers, and from being medically recommended shake diets, to skipping lunch at school from bullying, and a gym membership in my early teens it has been a fucking joke. If kids can lose weight before it becomes a lifelong issue, I would recommend it, because even if you are doing the best you can with knowing healthy food, right choices, with intake and output it’s not going to be the answer for every kid and why they gain weight. 

You risk the point of embedding eating disorders into some kids by restricting their diet so much more than their peers and showing them their weight is what’s holding them back from everything, the idea they get from why they need to be thin above everything else. Of course they know they’re fat. Kids are awful and will fucking let them know.

"Sadly, we'll end up seeing more doctors like this as the impact on residency programs in the wake of Dobbs plays out. Medical school graduates who want the most thorough training in their residencies will aim to match with residency programs in states that haven't criminalized basic gynecological procedures. But there's a limited number of residency programs out there, so the good ones in states that allow for a complete education will become more competitive (than they already are). The top graduates will flock to these states. The residency programs in states that outlaw/restricted gynecological procedures will end up with either folks who ideologically want to be there or those who performed less well in med school and are stuck at whatever residency program will take them.

"You have it 100% right.  Lost 100 pounds about 17 years ago.  Am still a size 2 and the 'biggest' I've been is a 4 being tight.  I don't weigh myself, I go by how certain clothes fit.  People ask ""omg what's your secret"" so excitedly whenever this comes up.  It's like watching a balloon deflate when I tell them well, I picked one thing at a time that was awful for me to reduce or get rid of. 

First I stopped drinking 2L of soda a day.  Then I stopped eating a family sized bag of chips as a meal\\*.  Then I went from a gallon of milk a day, to 2 gallons of week.  I just did that with every single food, slowly.  Once I was used to less of something, I turned my focus to another thing and went from there.  Exercise came later, I got into DDR about halfway through.  I think I was 170 or so at the time.  I didn't get back into outdoorsmanship until I was much smaller.  Elevation, asthma, and weight just didn't mix for me.  
  
People wanted to hear some magic formula where it was easy and there were no changes or work.  They don't care when I say ""well I still eat chips and ice cream, just not as every meal"".  The minute it took a period of concentrated effort, they were out.  NOW, I said people.  I didn't say large people.  Thin people react the exact same way when this conversation happens.  Our diet culture has drilled this idea into people (of all sizes) that if you get fat eating yummy nummies, don't worry!  A pill, shake, or magic fix will be along to save you.  And then you can go right back to what you were doing before...right?

The day I realised ""diets"" don't work and ""lifestyle changes"" do?  Game changer.

"As someone who lost 100lbs, finding a balance where you can occasionally eat a pizza or have a milkshake is really important too.  I'm not a 'cheat day' person (you only cheat yourself) but I make my indulgent foods at home so I can control the portion size and know exactly what I'm putting in.

Example:

Sheetz milkshake (large) around 1100 calories for a large (based on flavour and extras).  I can make my own raspberry milkshakes from 1 container fruit sorbet (450) + 3 cups milk of your choice (3-400).  From that you get 3 shakes, 2 if you are feeling indulgent.  That's 280-425 calories for a milkshake.  Even if I would go wild and drink the whole thing (which is like, 5 cups when blended so not happening) it would be 850.

A number of family members who shared a meal of bear meat that one of the family members had harvested earlier were subsequently infected with brain worms, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In July 2022, the Minnesota Department of Health was flagged that a 29-year-old man had been hospitalized multiple times over a two-and-a-half-week period with symptoms including fever, severe muscle soreness, swelling around the eyes, and other various maladies.

Following his second hospitalization, the man told doctors that he had days earlier attended a family gathering in South Dakota, and that one of the meals they shared included kabobs made from black bear meat that ""had been harvested by one of the family members in northern Saskatchewan.""

"> Why are you specifically mad at depressed people for not exercising, instead of cancer patients or hemiplegic stroke victims?

Stop being silly. 

I sincerely recommend avoiding attempts at mind-reading, and instead, doing as I've done here, and asking people what they're thinking/feeling, instead of projecting/assuming. 


Firstly, I'm not mad at depressed people. 

Secondly, it is an EXTREMELY, borderline insultingly rude false equivalency to compare cancer and stroke patients to people with depression. Whilst exercise would help prevent all of the above, and even help in treatment/recovery of stroke and cancer, compared with most DSM axis 1 disorders, e.g. run of the mill depression (which, yes, can be brutal, of course; speaking from experience), say, going for a run for depression = instant remedy, depression extremely reduced if not gone, temporarily; likely coming back shortly if you only exercise the once, but if you do it regularly, there will be an improvement, ranging from suicidal-to-not, to complete recovery. Contrast this with cancer and stroke recovery, and... well, it's just not the same, and I'm surprised anyone would compare the above. Even in the rare cases where it MIGHT not help (never say never), the proportion of: ""well, amazing, that definitely helped"" to ""didn't do shit"" re: exercise for cancer, stroke and depression would be quite extreme, not least ode to the fact of the chronological differences between disorders. 

I'm a psychotherapist, psych nurse, and someone who has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and trauma from a young age due to early traumatic experiences. I went on to train to help people. 

The tragedy is, these days, mental illness and trauma is a social get out of effort-jail free card, where people are socially excused from working to help themselves because they're struggling, which ultimately harms THEM more than anyone else. I was one of the recipients of this road to hell paved with good intentions, and I would have benefitted from people stressing to me how much better off I'd be if I did many things, including exercising.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJWbnBzQnJtV2ppRTF2dVpRM1djLU5tVlpFYk05dnRkb2w0bUN4dWczMHpJYUtFS1RSRGxQb2tMTlIxbi1hTWdET2FoajBCcEhScTVQN3hreWlpa004Snc9PQ==

"Lifting weights makes me angry and hot and sweaty but when I was doing it consistently it really did make the rest of my life better.

"Yea and that’s the problem. It puts the onus on young people to not only recognize symptoms, but wait until there’s a problem. 

The standard of care should cover screening as part of physical exams, if not yearly than once every few years according to their age. 

Preventative care saves lives. It also reduces medical expenses for patients when it’s caught early. But insurance companies don’t want to pay for it. 

It’s part of a larger issue. 

We’re pretty much the only “developed” country that doesn’t have universal healthcare. I’m not saying they don’t have issues, but our current system is highly unethical. 

The pharmaceutical and insurance industries throw insane amounts of money at policymakers to kill  universal healthcare. 

For example, we recently found out Novartis paid Cohen $1MM for access to Trump. That was just one consultation fee.

And they're getting longer, initially being like 5 minutes of the horrible sensation, now having reached upwards of 40 minutes straight. 

Imagine the worst diarrhea/constipation feeling you've ever felt, combined, with pain, and add on not being able to actually go to the bathroom any time it occurs, lasting for 40 minutes. They actually couldn't release me one day because it jacks my heart rate up so high; I had to wait until it went down. They didn't look into it any further other than to acknowledge my heart rate was nearly 200 for a few minutes. They didn't really acknowledge when I said this is what happens every time, that its doing this sometimes 11 times in a 24 hour period. 

I've started to come to terms that this is likely going to kill me before I ever even know what it is. I'm only 33. At the current rate of severity, I will be stuck in permanent agony within the next year. As is, I wake up 7+ times a night and spend several hours a day writhing in pain on my couch, punching my lower back to try and reduce the internal pain. At this present moment, my voice is half gone from the last few days of wailing.

**Can't say it's us missing it when we can't even get tested for it.**

 I've begged and cried for help. I'm jumping through all their hoops. They've *seen* one of the alarming effects themselves, to the point that I couldn't leave until it stopped. No one will test me for anything; not even a blood test. They only caught the heart rate because they take blood pressure and whatnot before all appointments. Last time, they didn't even do that. I just went in and started their exercises.

I can't even get anything for relief. A toradol shot for a different issue let me have 5 days agony-free. Didn't help what I got it for, but it helped this issue...they won't let me have toradol shots for this. Even though it gives me 5 days of sleep and living like a normal person. I'm not even worthy of the one thing thats helped me.

I think there is an opportunity to educate people away from the idea of having to go to the gym. You can make a gigantic impact on yourself just by exercising at home.

Your experience isn't gonna be the standard of care for everyone. That's probably part of the problem. I expected what you got, and I got put in physical therapy with no testing or blood work or imaging of any kind.

"Yeah, she did essentially say that if a child is capable of menstruation and carrying a viable fetus then it should be carried to term, however, as many doctors, besides Skop, have commented, this clearly is not only a bad precedent but dangerous to the child’s small and developing body, hence it’s not without high high risks, not to mention will almost definitely require a c section.

"Interestingly, in the UK the national health service no longer offers colonoscopies.

"This is an issue I researched for a public health class. Though it is an alarming trend, the relative risk is still low which is why younger adults with symptoms aren’t evaluated with as much scrutiny as those 45 and over or with relevant family history. Obviously there are other considerations other posters have touched on, but it’s worth pointing out the risk of developing CRC for those in their 20s and 30s is roughly 2 in 100,000. That’s not significant enough to justify lowering the recommended screening age. 

That doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of unfortunate exceptions, but the reality is most of those who present with GI symptoms in the cohort being discussed won’t have cancer. And not to scare anyone, but if you do have symptoms caused by CRC you’re already late in the game. Early stages are typically symptomless. So if you’ve been dealing with something like rectal bleeding for several years without progression, keep that in mind before you assume your symptoms are related to CRC. If you had symptomatic, untreated CRC for several years in all likelihood you’d be dead.

But of course, listen to your doctors and get checked if you’re worried.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiNExRRzhDUUpqMTdBclh4SWFZQklfcWFXdlh0R2hMMHJIM1RtclhSNFJOeUI3VmtjM3JtLWZFb05KcWpKSkFKa3pTMTA4OFRBZWcweDJ2SkFhSVZUN1cyNUEwT2JOdmFpNjlaQVowMzRkU3M9

"I'm not sure what you mean by starting from a space of deconditioning, but: 
1. Just being aware of the literature can help motivation. Why should someone invest calories/effort into something that they don't know will work? (Rhetorical). So, when people see the research, they know that their investment of energy, time, attention is worth trying. ALL research on how exercises prevents cancer, dementia, heart disease, stroke risk, etc. quality of life improvements, and mental health treatment, etc. 
2. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Identifying your values/value based goals, and attempting to live in line with them. Most people value good health, fitness, strength, delaying gratification, etc. 
3. Most people want to look more attractive, and exercise can help with that. I'd bring this up as a motivation with friends, but in this day and age where it's controversial to propose that someone who's athletically fit might be more attractive than someone who's morbidly obese, I'd sadly be wary of bringing it up with patients (people are digging their own graves with reality denial all over the place). One way to get to this organically would be to ask people about their own goals, and if that comes up, great. 
4. Imagining the outcome. How good you'll feel from having achieved that first 5k, or first strength training session, etc. 
5. Behavioural experiments. Noting down how you feel, what thoughts you want to challenge, what you're going to do to challenge them (e.g. I feel 10/10 depressed right now, I don't think that exercise will help me at all, but I'm going to force myself to go for a run, and then see). Then after, note down what happened, and re-rate emotions (e.g. I feel 1/10 depressed now, I'm surprised at how much better I feel, and how easy it was). 
6. Emotional schema therapy. Getting people to gain insight into how they perceive their emotions. E.g. when we feel depressed, people often see that as unusual, unique to them, unconquerable, permanent, when depression is normal, can be overcome, and very temporary, etc. 
7. Combining it with desiring to achieve skills that require exercise. E.g. I want to be able to climb X, I want to be able to do X martial art, I want to learn to do X dance, I want to get good at X sport, etc. 

Those are just a few things.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJiWDI1UmFJZ09adFUzVEVVdWt3a1J0NzlzN1ZCdlA5OUNzWDQzZE05QzgzSjI5Sl9wQW11dWhuZVVSa19GQUtmMWYwcmVORWIzLWxVcGpGVkllWDd5WHc9PQ==

"Doctors won't order them though. Young patients get blown off. That's the real issue here. Doctors only care about statistics. Its more likely a person doesn't have cancer so they make that assumption and tend to stick with it because the person is young.

Statistics are not useful for individuals but Doctors skipped that part of school.

This will never improve as long as we keep expecting people to basically diagnose themselves before going in. The point of a doctor is to be the expert, yet so often people get fucked if they don't fiercely self advocate. By fiercely, I mean getting nasty. I work in healthcare. Getting nasty seems to be the best way to open doors. As much as healthcare workers hate it, it's a result of their system.

"In 2006, a car load of grad students and I  drove out to rural West Virginia to collect mammals for a museum collection. We all arrived close to evening, and it was very cold so we gathered at warm fire that was being tended by a young woman (18-20 yo). 

She was stirring food in a Dutch oven set up on a tripod over the fire and offered all of us a cup of “beer” stew to warm up. If memory serves me right she was the daughter of the senior biologist we were meeting. 

The stew was very tender and comforting and went well with the Bushmill’s that was being passed around.

"People have to crowd source information because their Doctors spend no time with them. Doctors are useless to young people without an obvious problem because they assume young people can't get problems. Its also part of a Doctors job to teach that very communication but fat chance of that happening with 15 minute appointments. If young people are supposed to magically learn how to communicate better, who is supposed to teach them when their doctor doesn't give them the time of day?

The other point is its bs to say patients are primarily responsible for communication. They are to some extent, but its the doctor who is the expert. A patient describing their symptoms doesn't always use perfect language, its up to the doctor to ask the questions to tease out the real answer. Too often they only connect the dots when given textbook answers. That isn't on the patient, thats on the Doctors inability to translate from normal language to medical language. You say people shouldn't look shit up, but they almost need to just to use the correct terms for what they mean. For instance, its not uncommon for Doctors or their studies to do things like not count it as ""pain"" when a patient says discomfort. Ive had Doctors who hate it and Doctors who expect it. Its Doctors doing a shit job because of a shit system who don't want to think they are doing a shit job.

They avoid testing, even basic blood tests at all costs. Not every single one of course, but most.

"In 2006, a car load of grad students and I  drove out to rural West Virginia to collect mammals for a museum collection. We all arrived close to evening, and it was very cold so we gathered at warm fire that was being tended by a young woman (18-20 yo). 

She was stirring food in a Dutch oven set up on a tripod over the fire and offered all of us a cup of “beer” stew to warm up. If memory serves me right she was the daughter of the senior biologist we were meeting. 

The stew was very tender and comforting and went well with the Bushmill’s that was being passed around.

"""Increased risk"" needs a lot more context before it causes a change in standard of care. Let's say the rate of colon cancer in people under 45 has increased a whopping 200%. But what if the baseline before the increase was only 5000 people a year? That 200% increase now represents only 15000 people. 

Subjecting millions of people to annual Colonoscopies to catch an additional 10000 people is incredibly expensive and time consuming.  

Which is exactly why a lot of diagnostics and tests aren't offered to everyone across the board as routine care.

And not for nothing, these kinds of questions are common in any healthcare system. Private, public, whatever. Resource scarcity and allocation weigh on all systems from the privately insured to single payer public systems.

If you juice that same apple, your insulin will spike, without the fibers there is nothing for the bacteria to break down which will deplete your gut bacteria and leave you without a way of absorbing vitamins.
Cook foods for safety and to soften fibers but also include raw foods. And eat processed food only 5% of your daily intake, as a treat, after you ate a proper whole foods meal.

"I also noticed a lot of red flags while reading the article, and you can most definitively feel this was written by economists and not by the usual resident Ars' scientists. 

Like.. first of all, while not as stupid as the ""super size me"" one, opening the article with a country level correlation seems pretty odd (especially considering their own figures cannot even agree if Brazil is 15 or 50 percent UPF). Secondly, and most egregiously:

> Scientists at the US government’s Agricultural Research Service led another study demonstrating it is possible to build a healthy diet with 91 percent of the calories coming from UPFs. 

Whatever the connections the authors have were, this isn't a spy story. Even if the research came directly from the Doritos company, the data speaks you don't need *trust*.

One time, I had a terrible migraine and my aunt mentioned it to me. Cause my uncle does it when swimmer’s ear causes a migraine, and he swears by it. 

So I tried it mid-migraine and for the first time in my life (I’ve been suffering from consistent migraines.. I’m talkin, 3x a week+.. since I was four years old. I’m sure longer but that’s my oldest memory of one) it relieved it immediately. 

I’ve also had ear issues since I was four years old. Used to have ear infections constantly.. tubes in ears.. massive antibiotics.. the whole deal. So my ears consistently get “clogged up” I guess you can say??? Idk why. Or how.. just happens. 

Probably every 3-4 months or so, I do straight hydrogen peroxide in them. Lay on my side and let it sizzle for as long as I can stand the feeling. It always helps the clogged feeling! BUT — 😅 now when I turn to get it out and sit up….. I get dizzy AFFFF. Total vertigo.. which I have sometimes anyways without it. 

One time it was so bad the entire room was spinning and I completely freaked tf out. Scared me so bad lolol started Googling and have read mixed things!

Dr. Walter Willett: Numerous Potential Conflicts of Interest

Summary: Walter Willett, leader of the EAT-Lancet section on diet and health, has multiple serious potential conflicts of interest which cast doubt on his ability to bring an unbiased viewpoint to the question of whether a vegan/vegetarian diet is preferable for good health.

Principal findings:

Willett has advocated for a vegetarian diet, including little-to-no red meat consumption, since 1990/1991. In recent years, he has increasingly been leaning towards veganism.

Willett has published more than 200 papers on epidemiological data (which can show association but cannot demonstrate cause-and-effect) with findings that 

1) red meat is bad for health, 

2) that animal fats are bad for health, 

and/or 3) that a diet of grains/fruits/vegetables or vegetarianism generally is better for health. He has also published three commercial diet books that make these same arguments.

In the last few years of Willett’s directorship of the Harvard T.S. Chan School of Public Health, the school received between $455,000 and $1,500,000 from companies or groups interested in promoting vegetarian products or the vegetarian diet generally. 

The school also received between $350,000 and $950,000 from pharmaceutical companies, which presumably would not benefit from a nutritional solution to chronic disease.

Willett is an Advisor or Scientific Advisor to at least 7 groups/commercial enterprises that promote high-grain, vegetarian diets.


Willett has been closely involved in numerous commercial ventures with David Katz, a prominent promoter of the vegetarian diet who has received millions from food companies.


Willett rarely, if ever, discloses these potential conflicts of interest. Willett is the co-chair of the EAT-Lancet report, which does not disclose any of his potential conflicts of interest. Willett is the principal nutritionist on the EAT-Lancet report. The other nutritionists on the paper have published almost nothing on the subject of diet and disease, and nothing that contradicts Willet’s views.


Thus, on the subject of diet and health, the report presents only one viewpoint. This report cannot be considered a balanced paper

There are many scientists who do not believe that the plant-based diet is best for health. Indeed, the 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which favored a vegetarian diet, nevertheless concluded in its report that the evidence for any disease-fighting powers of this diet was “limited” –  the lowest rank given for available data.

Potential ideological/intellectual conflicts of interest:

Willett has promoted vegetarian diets since at least 1990/1991.


""Moderate red meat intake is certainly better than large amounts, but it’s quite possible that no red meat intake is even better,” said Dr. Walter C. Willett (1990).

“Doctors Walter Willett and Frank Sacks, researchers at the Harvard School of Public health… told us that vegetarianism is still the best way to go for anybody who is serious about lean.” (1991).


“We suggest that Dr. Small and his colleagues enjoy an occasional meatball when the urge becomes irresistible, preferably with a glass of red zinfandel… Beyond our land of meat and potatoes, the world’s vast array of vegetarian dishes containing no cholesterol and little 16:0 and 14:0 fatty acids provides an eating adventure, between the occasional meatballs, that Americans are only beginning to explore.” Walter Willett, M.D., Dr.P.H. Harvard School of Public Health Boston, MA 02115 Frank M. Sacks, M.D. Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02115 (Letter to the Editor, New England Journal of Medicine, Jan 10, 1991).


“Steak is no longer part of the Willett lexicon; he gave up red meat after the colon cancer study… The optimal diet, he says, is the Mediterranean menu - plenty of fruits and vegetables, very little meat or chicken.” (1993)

Note: the “colon cancer” study noted above concluded: “These prospective data provide evidence for the hypothesis that a diet high in saturated fat increases the risk of colorectal adenoma.” This is an epidemiological finding (which can show association but not prove causation) only on saturated fat/low fiber, but these are in no way synonymous with red meat. Also, the study was confined exclusively to male doctors and therefore could not be generalized to a larger population.
Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition of Harvard’s School of Public Health, calls the book [A Teen’s Guide to Going Vegetarian] “a sound guide for teens in the dietary jungle of America.” (1994)

Willett said, “the optimum amount of red meat you eat should be zero”. (2001).
Willett said , “The less red meat, the better. At most, it should be eaten only occasionally. And it may be maximally effective not to eat red meat at all.” (2001).
Willett has been a featured speaker for conferences promoting vegetarian/vegan diets: The Third Annual Congress on Vegetarian Nutrition, 1999; The Ivy League Vegan Conference, 2017.
Since 1983, Willett has published hundreds of papers concluding that fruits/vegetables and plant fats/proteins are healthy while animal fats/proteins/red meat are unhealthy. All of these papers are based on epidemiological data, which is fundamentally weak and cannot demonstrate “cause and effect.” Willett’s papers include:

78 findings that red meat is associated with a negative health outcome

37 findings that animal fats are associated with a negative outcome or that polyunsaturated 
vegetables are associated with a positive outcome. (Willet’s writings are highly inconsistent on the question as to whether animal fats might be a possible reason for the negative health consequences he associates with red meat.)

130 findings that vegetarian or mostly-vegetarian diets are associated with a positive health outcome.

Willett is also the author of three diet books that advocate a largely vegetarian diet for health, weight loss, and fertility.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJjd2VqTTBQUGludzBYMy1tNWhhVmFKVjlRWjdzSG96OGFobnk0eWVrVmo0RzNUS3B4WDJmVFFUUmtRZ2k4YzFWZW5lODA1UU10MWJ2aWNQUm04YTFlN3c9PQ==

Abstract
Introduction: Given the increase in ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption, their potential health effects have aroused concern. Whether UPF consumption is associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality is debatable. This study evaluates the association of UPF consumption with mortality.

Methods: A total of 108,714 U.S. adults from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (1993-2001), 208,051 UK adults from UK Biobank (2006-2010), and 41,070 U.S. adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018) were included. Dietary data were collected by dietary questionnaire and classified using the NOVA classification. UPF consumption was expressed as the weight proportion of UPFs in total foods consumed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% CIs. Mediation analysis was used to evaluate whether multiple metabolic pathways mediated the associations in UK Biobank. Analyses were performed in 2022-2023.

Results: Combined analyses of the three cohorts showed that those with the highest quartile of UPF consumption had higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.11-1.20) and cardiovascular disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.28) compared to the lowest quartile of UPF consumption. UPF consumption was not associated with cancer mortality risk. Biomarkers of liver function have the greatest mediating effects on all-cause mortality (20.3%), and biomarkers of inflammation have the greatest mediating effects on cardiovascular disease mortality (29.2%).

Conclusions: Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality risk, with multiple metabolic pathways playing mediating roles.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkZlFBWl9yV1c4MTJZay1MLUhOR1lkU2VmTzdZOElNdG0zZHRfbVV5QzQ1elNvSGlPR1Q5YnlJRDgwTnR1MHpKdFhOeTZXM25adDU5TzlHMGVFa01tZGc9PQ==

It says

'When we examined ultra-processed food intake and AHEI score together (fig 1), we did not observe a consistent association of ultra-processed foods with mortality within each quarter of the AHEI score, whereas AHEI score generally showed an inverse association with mortality within each of the quarters of ultra-processed food consumption.'

,Removing pack years of smoking from the multivariable model led to a much stronger positive association, whereas adjusting for the AHEI score attenuated the association toward null.'

'We observed that in the joint analysis, the AHEI score but not ultra-processed food intake showed a consistent association with mortality and that further adjustment for the AHEI score attenuated the association of ultra-processed food intake with mortality. Although including AHEI in the multivariable model for ultra-processed food may represent an overadjustment because common foods are included in both the AHEI and ultra-processed food, our data together suggest that dietary quality has a predominant influence on long term health, whereas the additional effect of food processing is likely to be limited'",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkRGFMMFdrbjFwdUU3S3g0aGs0aWhfNXpDbkJBV0lSYlVidEt6Vzh3WTFQcUhONHZicF90NFNCS1lvby1IcThjU2xhZ2IzbmY4YnhUdkpzRXk3bEg2N3c9PQ==

"I'm on ozempic. I was severely injured in an accident that left me on life support for weeks. I was in decent shape when I was hurt, running about 35km/week. I'd never been overweight before, but after discharge I suffered a complication associated with being intubated for so long that found me in and out of the hospital, in and out of surgery, and on high doses of corticosteroids for over a year. When I was hurt I weighed maybe 130/135 something like that (I didn't really weigh myself much because weight was never a concern) but the steroids made me pack it on. I was all of a sudden (like less than 3 months) more that what I was at full-term! All in all, I put on 40-50lbs in the year. I seriously thought that I was going to get stretch marks on my face!

I'm better now and off the steroids. I thought the weight would just fall off just as quickly as it went on. Well, turns out that's not how it works. I talked to my GP and we found out that I was medically obese and decided together that ozempic would be helpful. I'm being monitored by my GP and have a great relationship with her.

"Not how any of it works, and your siblings are educated idiots. If there was a 100% guaranteed cure for all cancers, it would be priced at whatever the market would bare, and when death is on the line the market will bare a massive cost. As it stands now, the market will bare a few hundred grand just for a fair chance of being cured. What will it bare if you upped those percentages? How much will people go into debt to treat what would otherwise be a late stage terminal case? And why are the assumptions always that some miracle cure will be cheap, but treatment is expensive? A decent chunk of the market forgoes treatment when there isn't a high enough chance of coming out better off. How many others would fork over their left arm for assured prevention?

The reality is that treatments, expensive as they are, pay the company's rent and bills, but cures buy the company yachts. On average a diabetic patient will fork over 220,000 in their life for treatments and medicine. How much would they pay for a one shot treatment that cured it? 300,000 or more? And the company wouldn't have to collect it over the course of 30 years.

Sugar-diabetes hypothesis



Postprandial Lipid Metabolism:

   - Initial Stage: Immediately following a meal on the carnivore diet, which is predominantly fat and protein with minimal to no carbohydrates, there is an increase in blood lipids from the digested food, known as postprandial lipemia.

   - Secondary Stage: As these dietary lipids are metabolized and cleared, any remaining lipids found in the bloodstream would then be primarily those released from body fat stores and not from the food itself.



Insulin's Role in Lipid Utilization:

   - Constant Presence of Insulin: In a typical diet high in carbohydrates, insulin and blood sugar levels remain elevated more consistently, inhibiting the effective use of these released lipids as they compete with glucose for cellular energy usage. The lipids circulate indefinitely in the chance they will be required.

   - Potential for Lipid Oxidation: Because the lipids remain in the bloodstream for an extended period due to persistent insulin and glucose levels, they make multiple laps around the circulatory system, and there is an increased risk of these lipids undergoing oxidation, contributing to the formation of small, dense LDL particles, which are the atherogenic particles. These particles also stick to the walls of the arteries where they were damaged by the glycation effects of high blood glucose and high blood pressure at the vortices of arterial branches. 

It is not the oxidation of the contents of the Lipoproteins that causes the dysfunction of the LDL receptor, but the glycation and oxidative damage of **receptor proteins** on the surface of the lipoprotein. 



Carnivore Diet as a Metabolic Strategy:

   - Reduced Carbohydrate Intake: The carnivore diet minimizes carbohydrate intake, thus reducing the frequency and amplitude of insulin spikes.This lower insulin level may facilitate greater and more efficient use of circulating lipids for energy, potentially reducing the risk of lipid oxidation and the formation of harmful LDL cholesterol, in addition to reduction of inflammation of the arterial walls. 

   - Utilization of Stored Lipids: With lower competing glucose levels, lipids released from storage (adipose tissue) are more readily oxidized for energy, which could contribute to better lipid profiles and reduced cardiovascular risk as they may not even make more than one lap through the circulatory system as opposed to an indefinite “lazy river of fat” which is more probable to be oxidized given the extended time period in circulation.





If supported by empirical evidence, this hypothesis could have damning implications for current dietary recommendations, particularly for individuals struggling with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and related cardiovascular diseases. Hosts of chronic degenerative diseases and ailments will be cured and we can openly promote the proper carnivore diet that our species evolved to eat. ",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJkdmdjczUxbDk3UnBmRFBJOG9iTnJ1OEtrSnBpREdYZ1UtSmRpdF9lT0ZYTXFXaVRCYXNGeW9BZi05WExZYVphbHA0VjJ2Rk95SzVJLWFBSXRDaGRLVzVGeHpoOGRRR3hDUldZUVhIY0ZDTFk9

"It’s a very interesting study, but some important notes:

1. This is a case study with only one patient. Plenty of things look promising in one person and fail to generalize in further studies. 
2. This was a person with extremely progressive type 2 diabetes who received a kidney transplant due to his diabetes. With this he was already on immunosuppression, which is required after this kind of procedure per the authors of the paper. In its current state this is most likely not worth it except for the sickest of sick diabetes patients. 
3. Just reading through the methods this is a very complicated procedure, and with that means very expensive. Again, most likely only worthwhile for the most sick patients given the efficacy of other diabetes drugs we already have. Hopefully though over time this could be decreased. 

Either way it’s a cool study and very interesting. Hopefully something comes out of it in the future, but these kinds of things tend to move really slow, so could be a while. Also, this is one study that has yet to be replicated, and like I said plenty of times science produces promising preliminary results that don’t pan out later. I wouldn’t expect a cure anytime soon with these results sadly. Very hopeful though!

"The same is true for Diabetes. The word ""diabetes mellitus"" is just a term meaning your blood glucose is high.

Some are believed to be brought on by obesity, but the full mechanism is not understood. We know that some drugs help, but we aren't sure exactly why. 

Others are auto-immune - where the person's immune system destroys the islet cells. Maybe because a virus got in there as it was being destroyed, or because a virus triggered a response that then attacked that area as well.

Some are genetic.

Others happen in athletes with no explanation at all.

There are many black boxes in the endocrine system around causes of diabetes. 

This cure may work for some but not all Type I people. It will not work at all for Type II as they have no problem with insulin production (unless they are only temp Type II headed for Type I because of pancreatic failure). 

As a type I myself, I doubt this will help me. I doubt it will be fully effective. I think it will help some people.

"This is not a study it is a case presentation. Total patient is 1.

It is a patient with type 2 diabetes with severe complications and is still not managing well on insulin. Apparently have issues with insulin secretion therefore they decided to try transplant islet cells (which makes insulin) into him. So technically he is a bit mix of type 1 and 2. (type 2 typically have very high insulin as your body is not sensitive to it any more. In this patient his body was not able to produce enough insulin amid the lowered sensitivity to the insulin.) It seems to work well because he is now making his own insulin therefore decreasing the need for medications and insulin.

As much as curing diabetes (which the title of this thread greatly sensationalized), it was actually more about that they developed a new technique of developing and transplanting islet cells to a human and allowing it to function well and not turning into cancers. It is more ""we tried this technique on this person and it worked"". Very far away from an actual cure hence the researchers called it a ""pilot study"".

The next step is to do it to a group of patients and observe the result. The more patients the more powerful the result. But certainly looks promising.

"> It’s still a shitty chronic and lifelong disease for those that have ‘reversed’ it.

No it’s not, lmao. Weight loss, intermittent fasting, getting at least a few miles of steps per day, and keto/carnivore restored my insulin sensitivity enough that I don’t even think about my diabetes anymore.

There is absolutely nothing “careful” about how I control it. I get all of my physical activity just from being on my feet all day at work. I don’t even count carbs anymore since the holidays, and have basically been eating whatever I want within my maintenance calories. I’m still overweight, but not morbidly obese like I used to be.

A1C is 5.2 with no meds. I even did my own OGTT at home and had normal results. I have literally cured my diabetes, and I’m just three years out from being wheeled to the ICU with an A1C of 13.5.

"As the lights dimmed in an operating room at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, Dr. Joshua Bederson prepared to make history.

Bederson, system chair for the Department of Neurosurgery at Mount Sinai Health System, is no stranger to long hours in an operating room. The former competitive gymnast has completed more than 6,500 procedures in his career, and he said he visualizes the steps for each one as if he’s rehearsing for a routine.   

On this particular morning in April, Bederson was readying for a meningioma resection case, which meant he would be removing a benign brain tumor. Bederson said his primary focus is always on caring for the patient, but in some cases, he also gets to help advance science. 

This procedure was one such case. 

A small crowd gathered as Bederson took his seat in the operating room, his silhouette aglow from the bright white light shining on the patient in front of him. Health-care workers, scientists and CNBC craned forward – some peering through windows – to watch as Bederson placed four electrode arrays from Precision Neuroscience onto the surface of the patient’s brain for the first time.

"Some of these comments are unhinged. I genuinely want to know why it makes some people so mad that overweight and obese people now have the option of taking these prescription medications to help them lose weight? There’s so many variables - food addiction, insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, autoimmune disorders, etc. Why would it make you mad that people want to get better and are using this as a way to do that? Is it because you are at the gym 24/7 and eating plain iceberg lettuce and a side of ice for your meals? Are you mad because you are making yourself miserable to maintain your physique? If you’re disgusted by people being overweight, wouldn’t you want them to lose weight? It literally doesn’t make sense. You hate people being fat but you also hate people for getting help. Can you comprehend a lifetime of trying every diet and every exercise routine to only lose ten pounds and never be able to get past that point no matter what you do?

Scientists have warned of an urgent need for more research into the long-term health impacts of tattoos after new research found they may increase the risk of lymphoma cancer.

Roughly one third of Americans have at least one tattoo, 2023 Pew Research Center surveys show. However, very little is known about the long-term effects on our health of getting inked.

"I’m in STEM but not medicine, so there’s a lot I don’t follow in that paper, it is an association at this point but a few things:

For a potential carcinogenic toxicity situation, I’d expect dose response and that’s not what they found.

“We found no evidence of an increased risk with a larger total area of tattooed body surface. On the contrary, we observed the highest lymphoma risk in individuals with tattoos smaller than one hand palm.”

That’s odd and interesting.

This doesn’t surprise me:

“unmatched analysis was suggestive of a higher risk associated with having black/grey tattoos only (IRR:1.32; 95% CI 1.04–1.68) compared with having both black and coloured tattoos (IRR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.92–1.35)”

IDK why but black work do seem like *more* ink - I have a number of tattoos and they just end up putting down more ink with them than when there’s color. But again, I’m defaulting to assuming a dose response when they are reporting they didn’t find one. 

How about this business, the IRR goes up significantly - so the association of lymphoma and tattoos - if there was laser removal:

“Laser treatment for tattoo removal seemed to drastically modify the risk of lymphoma. Among tattooed participants who had undergone laser treatment, the relative risk of lymphoma in the matched analysis was 2.63 (95% CI 0.96–7.18), although the estimate was associated with a wide confidence interval because of small numbers. When we retained more data and performed an unmatched analysis, the estimate indicated substantial effect modification by tattoo laser removal (IRR = 2.99; 95% CI 1.37–6.52).”

But the confidence interval is pretty wide, which makes it less precise than the previous associations. 

Interesting results, but a big study group. They pulled out various people for various reasons and added in controls in ways I don’t understand. (I do field biology, not people.)

"That is the case. However, reading the article, here's the important part: 

The patient was a 59-year-old man with a 25 history of untreated type 2 diabetes. 

TLDR The guy didn't control his sugar and he was on his deathbed suffering from neuropathy and renal failure and the only way to save his life was a kidney transplant that they weren't going to give him because his sugar was out of whack. 

So the cure basically was to reboot some pancreatic cells (requiring another donor) So they could manage his insulin levels correctly. 

I'm sure there was a discussion about carbohydrate control. 

I've had tons and tons of type 2 diabetes. People tell me they were cured and don't need medication anymore. 

Their diet is 100% meat and vegetables and the second they have a slice of pizza they spike. That's not cured. It's well controlled. 

Now in this case you basically could undergo a transplant surgery that could actually correct your diabetes (insulin response) But it's going to come back if you don't control your carbs. 

Promising but not a panacea unless we can somehow grow those cells outside of a human body so that a donor is no longer required. If that were the case then it would be simply a matter of giving insulin resistant patients an injection once a year or so.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlVmEtclRURHpkSFRUVkgwYzd4TnhCNG9UOGdtREY0NmM0UEZjVUxlTEloeWJ5SHBhNXk5bGV5Sl8yanhIUHlBekg2NXZXZHg4QXJZYjJvVUlBb1RNMEE9PQ==

Diabetic people lack insulin producing cells, therefore get huge spikes of BG and can die from this in the long run.  Most treatments on the market for diabetes is regular injections of insulin, but some people have devised ways to replace all the missing islet cells so that regular shots are unnecessary.

This group used stem cells from a patient, turned them into islet cells and transplanted them into a patient in the hopes to replace all the dead islet cells.

"From what I’ve read, this article included, it’s more than the skin being affected. I’ve read about it being found concentrated in lymph nodes (one of the studies I saw was pretty horrific because the lymph nodes needed to be removed and the woman had gotten the tattoo around her vulva). This article is now talking about lymphoma related to tatto ink, which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. 


Anything injected under the skin has to be sterile. Even a little bit of bacteria on your skin before an injection can cause problems, so it’s no wonder unregulated ink could as well. Tattoo reactions of the skin don’t seem to be that uncommon (don’t quote me on that), but those are the visible ones where it’s easy to pinpoint the source as being the tattoo. IIRC, yellow and red inks tend to cause more acute skin reactions, but black inks might have the most problematic ingredients overall.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNTF4WkUxbENXaTQ1N2EwckhmbFpZMmZjbkJFdzkxRlBzYnlqbTNaLWYxZnNNdHdsOURHNWJnb2xhWTlBME9Rd0xTVWxZNE16UFl1Rm4ybHVoZzNCRXc9PQ==
"> that we were this close to fixing T2D

What was done in this paper has been done many many times.  The difference here is that theoretically, because it is a patient derived stem cell, there shouldn't be an immune reaction to it.  The key is making sure the graft stays alive, and isn't targetted by the immune system.

T1D is much more complicated.  by time you catch a young person dealing with T1D, their islets are usually complete destroyed. There are some amazing ongoing trials targetting T1D though.

Currently there are a handful of FDA trials ongoing for looking into transplantation of islet cells.  This study will likely be looking into stem cell derived grafts.  Others have simply taken healthy grafts from other sources; most of these trials have failed.

There are also a few trials that suppress the immune system by deletion of certain cell types that cause disease.  This is promising for graft survivial, but leaves the patient compromised to infections.

There is also at least one trial ongoing that trains your immune system to stop reacting to islet cells via a vaccination.  Because your immune system is no longer reactive to the islet cells, grafts are much more easily protected.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlcmR3UDFnRWVLYUtuODcxREdxb2h5eGJybWpwZjUtcjBCTFVEQ2FvTS1sLVBUZVVQd195bkpGWWx0RlNhNUVKWTljRl9TVkZUYjdZcUNmbG5oekZvaGc9PQ==

"If you read the actual results the maths doesnt math well.


There is the claim that there is a 21% additional risk (if you are tattooed) of getting lymphoma, but the stats actually come from 21% of the lymphoma sufferers who answered the questionnaire had tattoos. As for those who answered the questionnaire who did not have lymphoma and never did - 18% of those people had tattoos.


The actual number of individuals between 21% and 18% of each of these populations when compared against one another is a very small difference. Meaning that really the results show that in this population (of ALL questionnaire answerers) approximately 19-20% of people had tattoos.


So this claim is .....outrageous (!?).

"If you have cancer in your lymph nodes it’s probably safer to have fewer lymph nodes than it is to have cancer that can spread and kill you. It’s not ideal, but none of the cancer treatments are- they’re just trying to keep you alive and ideally, functioning. My mom had a few removed due to breast cancer, and dissecting lymph nodes also is useful for diagnosing or determining the stage of the cancer. IIRC, at least one of the research studies I read regarding tattoo ink in lymph nodes was found accidentally when they were screening for cancer; I think in more than one study the lymph nodes showed up in MRI’s because of the ink, and then were biopsied or removed for suspicion of cancer, only to find ink!

"*New evidence suggests that feeding children smooth peanut butter during infancy and early childhood can help reduce their risk of developing a peanut allergy even years later.*

>Compared with avoiding peanuts, starting peanut consumption in infancy – [as early as around 4 months of age](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kings-news?categories=505c6ef3-27ad-49ad-ab3b-31289188963a), as a soft pureed paste, for instance – and continuing regularly to around 5 years old was associated with a 71% reduced rate of peanut allergy among adolescents in the United Kingdom, according to a study published Tuesday in [the journal NEJM Evidence](https://evidence.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/EVIDoa2300311).

>“I was not entirely surprised because infants in Israel are exposed to peanuts very early and allergy does not appear to emerge in adolescence or adults. This suggests the protection is long-term,” Gideon Lack, professor of pediatric allergy at [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/gideon-lack) and an author of the study, said in an email.

>“Peanut allergy develops very early in most children between six and 12 months of life. If you want to prevent a disease this needs to be done before the disease develops,” Lack said of exposing children to peanuts. “This biological phenomenon is based on an immunological principle known as oral tolerance induction. We have known for many decades that young mice or other experimental animals who are fed foods such as egg or milk or peanut cannot develop these allergies later.”

>Starting in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics [recommended](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/Peanut-Allergies-What-You-Should-Know-About-the-Latest-Research.aspx#:~:text=For%20many%20years%2C%20experts%20thought,or%20with%20other%20food%20allergies%2C) delaying the introduction of peanuts until 3 years, but it ended that recommendation in 2008.

>About a decade later, in 2019, the [AAP updated its guidance](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/143/4/e20190281/37226/The-Effects-of-Early-Nutritional-Interventions-on) to say that delaying the introduction of allergenic foods doesn’t prevent disease and that “there is now evidence that early introduction of peanuts may prevent peanut allergy.”",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNDBSZkFFamVnOXhoQ1pleGlVVHR0eEVVajEta2dVQ2Q1c2JvOV9tSzBkRVFVVGtTV1dIWGNLWnBjVEUtd0xhS3RocmRsVHlfMkJCdEE3eTZ6VmJZY1E9PQ==

"My uncle is an orthodontist. You can still enjoy your favorite foods and drinks. He drinks a ton of Diet Coke, coffee, wine, eats carbs daily, loves chocolate and his teeth are the nicest teeth I’ve ever seen. Never had a cavity.

Here are some tips to help reduce risk of damage or cavities:

- In the morning, either brush before coffee & breakfast, or wait at least 30 min after to brush teeth.

- After brushing, don’t rinse out mouth with water. Just spit. This allows the fluoride to coat and better protect your teeth. 

- Try to drink acidic or sugary drinks in a shorter period of time. Less than 30 min is ideal. 

- Drink water after acidic or sugary drinks/food. If you’re sipping on a drink for some time, take breaks with water. Swish around if you can. 

- Xylitol gum, especially after a really sugary meal, can be helpful. Highly toxic to dogs so be mindful.

- If drinking something acidic like wine before bed, try waiting an hour or 2 before brushing teeth. Brushing immediately after can wear out your enamel.

- Floss before brushing your teeth. Flossing really is so important. Plus proper brushing (angled 45 degrees, focus on gums, at least 2 minutes long, soft bristle brush).

- Regular dentist visits for deep cleaning.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlNHNfY29SN0Rwb2d5SVctWmVCNnNQZTJCeFlWTzRoUEZHWDZWRVBJYy0wa3EwZ0ZIaEYxVEdFS1ZqQVp5TUZmY0xJcXhRemZjaUk2TWktaF9uMzN2QTktdUNjcDYweDVDTi1aZnBRV0IwNnc9

"In the article it says the results are purely associative, and I will cop to the fact the headline is ""may"" and not a certainity. However, what gives me pause here is that tattoos are an extremely old art practice and if there was a noted rise in cancer following them then surely, by now, we would have observed this on a larger scale. 

Although everything can be framed as causal to cancer, I think it feels like a leap to frame tattoos as unsafe as they sort of do in the article. Anyone can observe cause and effect, and the causal relation between tattoos and cancer hasn't been evidenced over the literal thousands of years tattooing has been a thing. 

This study shows an association, but you can also associate drinking water and death.

"Slightly higher risk with all black ink tattoos, but maybe meaningless/confusing because size of tattoos regardless of black only or color had no direct effect. That’s what dose response means - you should see increasing risk/toxicity with higher amounts of ink if the ink is the problem. When clear dose response is absent, it’s a head scratcher. It tells us it might not be the ink that’s the issue. Maybe tattooed people who get lymphoma have something else in common, or lots of other things. All these folks are from the same country for example. 

For some reason, laser removal of tattoos shows a stronger relationship to lymphoma cases. Someone else said maybe that’s because laser treatment breaks up the ink and allows it to enter the bloodstream/lymph system, which is a good idea that could be tested.

None of this means anything at this point. It’s just a study, not a controlled trial. There could be other factors that explain what they are seeing that aren’t what we are thinking at all. Time and more studies are needed.

Study - we look at data after a bunch of events and try to draw conclusions VS Controlled trial - we randomize and control the things that might be messing up the one or two questions we’re trying to answer. We do studies first to develop ideas and help write grant requests to get money for big research efforts and controlled trials.

"Man, I used to do property inspections for different banks on foreclosures to check if there were squatters or any damage.  Sometimes they’d pour concrete in the toilets or cut the electrical, etc out of spite.

One time I got sent out to this farmhouse with a bunch of industrial chicken coops that got shut down because of bird flu and it was one of the most bizarre things I’ve ever seen.

All of the chicken houses had like bio hazard signs on them condemning them.

I had to “gain access” to the house aka break in, and change the locks after taking pictures of everything.  I got in through a back window and as soon as I put my foot down there must have been 30 mice that scattered away.  There were full bags of groceries just sitting on the counter from an Asian market.  There was corn scattered all over the floor of the house (explaining the mice).  It smelled absolutely putrid.

I started the walk through and found mattresses everywhere.  The three bedrooms upstairs all had 2-3 mattresses a piece in each of them.  Things were littered with children’s clothes, junk food, and condom wrappers.

I walked downstairs to go through the master and when I opened the door I saw boxes stacked floor to ceiling filled with prescription opiates.  I debated for about two seconds whether I could flip them for cash, then decided someone was probably coming back for those and I needed to finish up and get the hell out of there.

"It’s interesting. I would like to know more about the “other relevant factors.” There are so many health behaviors and living conditions that contribute to cancer risk, and tattling is associated heavily with lifestyle and social grouping. I don’t see any way to fully adjust for those. So, this is counfounded AF, at best. 

Having said that, 21% is a huge increase (percent changes like that are very rare in health sciences). 

I do think it’s creepy that tattoo ink turns your lymph nodes black. There is a plausible pathway, but unless you use an RCT and assign people to the condition of tattooing/not tattooing, it will be impossible to fully disentangle causation.

One more thought:
I think the lack of dose response and greater risk with black and grey supports the idea that there are confounders at work. As in: those are stylistic choices that are more likely to be associated with other lifestyle factors and health behaviors. Maybe. I’m speculating, but I think it points to the idea that it isn’t just a physiological pathway at work here.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlMDN2ekw1Q0I1bXNfcF9XQm9tYjYyckpMak83bE9sS0NJbHZSSUtpdTRDeUVlbHNjV0JtVmYyejZVVjd0Z1BXVnl4OWZGTnF5TjIwbW9yTHZ5TTJoaGlESkxrN3lSajFMcWZyQzNiaW9wOVk9

"I agree.

I’d love to see the sample stratified by the age of their ink by square inch THEN by lymphoma risk to see if age of tattoo itself or changes in ink makeup over time might have something to do with it. Pretty sure ink formulations available in 1975 were likely different than 2000, also depending on where people were tattooed.

Stratification by where the majority of tattoos are on one’s body.

Do people who have tattoos directly over lymph nodes have more lymphoma? How do those people fare with laser treatment?

"That's a big part, killing birds is presumably to decrease transmission between farms and chicken houses. 

Why not cattle though? Probably money. Broiler chickens are slaughtered at 6 weeks, anyway. Egg layers take 6 months to lay, but can be replaced faster than cows - and have a value of about $25-$40 each.

Dairy cows are 2+ years old before they can join a dairy herd. Beef cattle are killed I think right around that age, at maturity? I haven’t checked prices in a while, but used to be cows were $900-$2000 apiece, for average non-registered beef cattle, depending on age and gender. Killing those is a bigger financial hit and a cow gestation is 9 months, so replacement is much slower.

As for feeding the dead birds, the proper protocol is to compost or burn the culled animals. At this point the USDA is stepping in to monitor the culling process.

"I am currently pregnant with a very very wanted child, and my husband and I are happy and doing well. It's still so hard. I am nauseous every day despite medication, which becomes honestly pretty maddening. My heart rate is higher, I get winded easier (I think due to the increased blood volume). I'm only 2 months in. I have great health insurance. I've had to step down from a leadership position at my internship. I'm worried I won't get as good of a job (currently looking after graduating). I already see this affecting my career. I feel much less attractive already because I can't do much exercise due to the nausea (I walk as much as possible). I'm nervous about the effect this will have on my body. Not just how I look, which are still valid concerns, but things like the risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, the risk of dying in childbirth, the risk of carrying this baby to term only to have a still born, the risk of post partum depression, the risk of SIDS. I'm nervous about the costs even though at least I finally graduated. It's also really hard having to be so careful not to do anything to hurt the baby. Never being able to have a drink. Not being able to eat some foods I love. Having to eat all my eggs with fully cooked yolks (dipping buttered toast in eggs is one of my favorite foods). Pregnancy is almost a year. It feels like there's still so much of it ahead of me. And we haven't even told most people yet. I'm dreading all the pushy advice other mothers have warned me about and people trying to touchy my body. I'm worried about the unpleasantness of having boundaries about the kid which I know I need to do to protect them from things like RSV, oral herpes, COVID, etc. It's so overwhelming. And my situation is about as ideal as you could get for an American.

Edit: I also live in California and I'm white, so statistically my odds of coming out of this healthy are higher than a lot of the country.

"Remember when Michelle Obama wanted to promote healthy eating for children and people lost their damn minds?

This is why. It has been trending this way for a long time. Stop feeding your kids crap and encourage them to be active. You can blame whatever additives you want, but the decision to give the food begins and ends with the parents. Parents are responsible for researching ingredients, and healthy habits start at home.

Is it easy? No. But raising a whole damn human isn't going to be easy and you need to be willing to put the work in for it to be successful. The people responsible for raising kids are always the parents- not teachers, neighbors, extended family, or media. No more of this ""it takes a village"" or ""my tribe"" crap.

"There are a few reasons to support before breakfast brushing. When you sleep, you don’t excrete as much saliva, this allows harmful bacteria to multiply and thrive at a much faster rate than during the day. Waiting to brush means that bacteria sits in your mouth longer and will continue to multiply and excrete. It then feeds on the breakfast. Additionally, brushing right after your meal could wear your enamel, and brushing before breakfast not only removes that bacteria as soon as possible, but stimulates saliva that keeps bacteria at bay, and provides a protective coat that prevents damage from acidic foods and drinks like coffee. 

On the other hand, simply waiting 30 min after eating to brush your teeth, you’re able to effectively brush off your breakfast, the harmful bacteria from the night before, and start fresh for the day. Either way is fine! Pros and cons for both. 

If one wanted the benefits of both, a simple solution is brush before breakfast, then rinse with a non-alcoholic fluoride containing mouthwash after (I.e. ACT, therabreath). Or vice versa. Not a dentist, but I do the former because I’m like you and want a fresh start lol.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlZDQxdjB2WkZkb3hUUld1TDlJdFRzMWdmSm5lOGhkQTVGXzNtRHBFMXMtSnVQTmlmekI5b2tTdi0zV3Bhcl9xdXh1eHBvQ0RZc2wxeXl6Q3NkRERaZi1XQWx0ODk2b1l6TkVQcW4tMGhQNzA9

re: brushing after eating wearing down enamel - I wonder if the texture of your breakfast food makes a difference?  I usually have something very soft like eggs or bananas + protein shake for breakfast, which are very quick to prepare and get eaten right after I wake up.  is it simply the act of eating anything at all that wears enamel, or is it the assumption that people might be eating harder/crunchier foods like cereal?  I’m having a hard time trying to think of acidic breakfast foods, maybe fruit salad with citrus?  I never have citrus in the morning for medication reasons anyway.

"Haha, oh trust me! My husband still brushes after breakfast because he doesn’t want the minty flavor to ruin it. It’s totally okay to wait to brush after! As long as you brush! 

As for waiting, I’m not in dentistry so I’m unsure. I’m not even sure if it’s acidic foods in general, if it includes acidic producing substances like phosphorus found in eggs, if it’s the acidity of the mouth after eating any foods, or if it’s more than just acidity. All I know is the general rule of thumb is wait 30-60 minutes after brushing in the morning, the more acidic the actual food the longer. Like with wine my uncle told me to wait at least an hour of 2 to brush.

Some acidic foods according to [this dentistry](https://www.windycityfamilydental.com/news-feed/acidic-foods-and-teeth-how-one-can-affect-the-other/). I’m not sure how accurate, but they include fruits in general (berries, peaches, etc), eggs, and dairy on the list.

"I don’t know if this helps any but as a 2nd time mom w a 2 week old newborn and almost 3yr old toddler, just wanted to share that the 2nd trimester is so much better than the 1st. The 1st is absolutely the worst thing ever with that nausea, especially because you can’t even tell people why you’re nauseous if you are waiting to share the news. And it’s the start of hormones being all over the place. 

Like everything in pregnancy and parenting/child development, it’s a phase. This phase will turn into a new one, which will also pass. The pain and sacrifice we as mothers endure to have a child is a lot, and there’s a lot of health risks/mental load/depression/anxiety that comes with it. But in the end seeing and holding your baby is worth it. Watching them discover the world, learn and grow is such a beautiful thing and there isn’t any type of love like it. 

It’s easier said than done but try not to think about all the bad things that could happen, and focus more on the good things that can.

"I have a story about a pot emergency! A few Thanksgivings back, my uncle offered my other uncle some of his newly legal recreational marijuana. My other uncle hadn't used pot in a few decades, so it was a bit stronger than he was used to. He sat down in the chair and got very still and quiet. My aunt (his wife) noticed this and checked how he was doing. No response. We all start to get really nervous, loudly calling out different advice and concerns. I don't know whether I recommended a sternal rub or not, but after a few minutes of his unnresponsiveness, I suggested it was now the time to call emergency services - unresponsive man in his late 60s could have been a number of possible medical emergenies. This was going on way too long to be a joke and my aunt is freaking out. My aunt makes the call as she stood right to him.

A minute or so after she hangs up, ambulance on its way, we see my unresponsive uncle's mouth twitch into a smile. With a giggle, he opened his eyes. All hell breaks loose as first my aunts and then my uncle go off on him for scaring us! My cousins and I are laughing in relief. My uncle explains that he wasn't faking being unresponsive, but the pot was much, much stronger than he had ever had before. Then my first uncle, the one who provided the pot, started freaking out over emergency services coming to the house when he had been the one to supply the pot. For a moment, I thought he was going to need the unneeded ambulance. I quickly brought up our state's laws on recreational marijuana to show him he had done nothing illegal and to calm down. The EMTs had a good laugh at the situation and we offered them dessert in thanks.

The subsequent [SNL ""We're dead"" sketch](https://youtu.be/i-JApCk5DoM?si=Dm6eQjIc0US4gICq) put me into hysterics because it reminded me so much of our Thanksgiving. It's a good thing my aunts didn't use any or it would have been a reenactment.

"It works until the healthy food is expensive. We do what we can to get healthy stuff cheap, we have a CSA that we are a part of, we split a cow with a neighbor, we trade farmwork for eggs and other benefits once a week, seasonally dependant (strawberries, beets, etc). But the bad stuff is so much cheaper than the good stuff, especially when your kids have texture issues and reject rice. Eating beans is more expensive than it used to be by a lot, so without the rice filler, its rough! Add in dietary restrictions for medical needs and its brutal when a loaf of bread is $6.

Only reason we are able to do all of that is that we can't afford daycare, so I had to quit my job and I am able bring the kids around with me everywhere to get the cheap food and help stuff. And we were able to invest in a chest freezer. If I was part of a double income household, there would be no chance in hell that there would be time to take care of all of that. In my case I had twins first, so I didn't have a whole lot of choice about being inundated with the cost and all that. 

It absolutely is on the parents to do responsibility, but we are so much more alone than our parents were. The average mom in the 90s parented for 12 hours a week, average dad 7. Their dad parented on average 2 hours a week. The current average parenting is 40 hours, on top of everything else. The numbers for a village have to give somewhere, because we don't have them anymore and its all on one or two people in a lot of places now. So the it takes a village and tribe stuff isn't just crap. It used to be common and is now rare in the US. Kids have to be allowed to be in public to learn how to be in public, but it is being forced the other way around now and its rough. 

I don't know if you are a parent or not, but it isn't as ""easy"" now as it used to be. My parents would drop me on my grandparents every day for hours, and I would only see them at breakfast and dinner. Their parents would do the same. But now, generally, that isn't an option for most of us, because the grandparents have moved to more affordable areas in their retirement, or have lost their goddamn minds and are not safe to be near kids unsupervised. 

This isn't just a parents thing. It is a society thing that is too tired to be a village when we are all working multiple jobs to scrape by.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJlQk9KSEluRS02SWlBR2EtM3ItUmRNT1NCc1Npd3VyS3F6T0h3ZDJoTXlVc3BKLUtuMjd2OENfelBVXzRHQUxYUkFlWVJDOFVJaGY3d0cxcUxpdlZKeEE9PQ==

Those are like page 3-4 issues for me i got myself and my family and loved ones on the front page, and in the bottom corner theres a tiny secion slotted out for political cartoons in the newspaper of my life. My comment about chinese organ harvesting was the figurative daily comic in that metaphor but you just went and ruined it trying to show me all this stuff u wanna talk about in the world news on page three when im just sitting here trying to enjoy the paper and for one moment of my dat NOT think about the evils of the world by making a lighthearted pun about them. 

Thanks for ruining it for me dude... Next maybe try finding a snowman sub and educating them on the dangers of snow sculpture accidents and how special interests lobbying keeps the snow sculpture community unregulated and dangerous. Or maybe u could go find someone who posted a smokey the bear meme and bombard them with facts about us convicts forced to fight wildfires  or how shady power companys are covering up their roles in starting fires that burned family's alive, and also dont forget to mention how the evil us gov. is TOTALLY in on it.....

"I work in labor and delivery. Most of the moms we see nowadays are honestly on Medicaid or, as someone who works in a border state- uninsured. Medicaid pays on average like 40 or 50% less than private insurance for theoretically what is supposed to be the same exact care. Our uninsured patient package at my current hospital is even less. it’s basically a flat rate and it just covers everything regardless of if there’s like major complications or it’s a totally routine delivery. 

I can tell you don’t work in obstetrics.  Everyone who does knows that Labor and delivery is a loss leader in healthcare no matter how you squeeze it. That’s why so many obstetric units around the nation are closing. 

C-sections require an extra night stay in the hospital. An extra night the hospital is already taking a loss on. They come with dramatically increased risk of pp wound infection and hemorrhage risk. More things that they’ll have to fix and not get adequately reimbursed for. An increased risk of a Nicu admission/stay for the baby. Again, this is another underinsured patient now getting admitted to the hospital. We have the worst maternal mortality in the developed world. So yeah.

Scientists have made a major breakthrough in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease, opening up new avenues toward future treatments.

Alzheimer's disease affects roughly 5.8 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The progressive disease is the most common form of dementia and is associated with memory loss and cognitive decline in regions of the brain involved in thought, memory and language.

“Fruits and vegetables contain a variety of phytochemicals, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, that have been shown to protect against prostate cancer,” the authors explained. “Plant foods are also a source of dietary fiber, which may promote satiety and regulate blood glucose levels.”

“Animal-based foods (including meat and dairy) have been associated with increased exposure to potentially harmful substances, such as hormones and heterocyclic amines,” the authors added. “High intake of red, processed meats, and dairy has been associated with increased insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor-1, which have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk and potentially, mortality. Whole milk, in particular, has been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence.”",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmSHVJSVZpT2R1cWRsU0F6bnRPRFdPQ2RLVTNUajhfV2lPQUFrYUozUFhfc0JMVkYybXpRYjlYTllWdTg2RFl1S1lSZHdLM1dHRndHdm4wQW5TR2hXVnc9PQ==

You are in luck to know of the risk though, early detection can help mitigate much of the disease far better since if you only wait for behavior symptoms the disease is much farther along typically.

"Okay. I’m going to get in the weeds a bit about cattle feed & farming. 

Broiler litter being fed to cows is most likely not a vector or how bird flu got into herds. Possibly, but very not likely. 

Boiler litter is rarely fed to dairy herds, it’s fed to beef cattle - those types of cows do not have much if any interaction with each other. Obviously there are caveats but for the most part it’s beef or dairy farm not both. Broiler litter is used as a protein bulking supplement. Dairy cattle eat more grains/grasses to make energy to make milk. Think carb loading (dairy) or weight lifter (beef). Since the biggest out breaks have been in dairy and not beef cattle that would point to another main entry point. 

I’m in a state that is currently experiencing a number of dairy cow herds with bird flu. Broiler litter cannot be fed to lactating cattle (dairy cows), and it must be pasteurized to be able to feed to any cattle (state law). Pasteurization has already been shown to kill the virus. It would be nearly impossible to have broiler litter be the source. 

Is using chicken poop and the stuff they sit in as cow feed absolutely disgusting. Sure is! The use of broiler litter in the news is most likely a case of “this is gross so let’s blame bird flu on it” 

If anyone is concerned about broiler litter being used as cattle feed you should avoid buying grocery store meats as much as possible (often hard to track sources and cheapest meat sources). Go to a butcher, most of the time they know which farm the beef cattle are coming from, you can ask the butcher and get the name of farms to look up their practices. If you’re able buy straight from a farm. If you’re on the west coast look for beef raised on California farms because all broiler litter as a feed is banned. Most states have some kind of regulation when using broiler feed you’d have to get that info per state, which can usually be obtained by searching cooperative extension offices, and those can be found on the National Institute of Food and Agriculture website. And also you can pressure politicians to make laws against using literal shit as a feed source.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJmSkZlZTlEaFNFaHY5QnE1RXNsdm5GbTlqY1NBSHAzUExFSWZlVGVOblkxNUM3enZjQU82WGowMGRnVnAxQlpNeWNCX0h5enVkWFBHajJjeW5OQlFGV2c9PQ==

Terrified this is not enough? If you want to get into peptides they have research showing neuroprotective effects that specifically benefits Alzheimer's patients. This stuff really needs to be studied more it appears pretty amazing for brain health.

>P21 is a nootropic peptide targeting improved neurogenesis. In animal studies, P21 has been shown to boost levels of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), thus promoting neurogenesis (nerve growth) and inhibiting the formation of Amyloid plaques and Tau proteins seen in Alzheimer's disease. BDNF has been linked not just to enhanced neurogenesis, but to the down regulation of certain enzyme responsible for tau and amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's brains. P21 has been shown to improve cognition in animal models.

"Jerusalem Demsas: “In 2019, the United States recorded [twice as many maternal deaths](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2806661?resultClick=1) as in 1999. You may have seen articles under headlines such as ‘More Mothers Are Dying’ that frame this situation as a crisis. The notion that the U.S. has fallen behind other highly developed nations in addressing rising maternal deaths has filtered from academia into activist circles, newsrooms, social media, and everyday conversation. The general public might conclude: In America, pregnancy is getting deadlier by the year.

“Recently, however, Saloni Dattani, a scholar with the research organization Our World in Data, [reported](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement) definitively that measurement changes are largely to blame for the seemingly inexorable rise in maternal deaths. Things aren’t getting *worse* for women; we’re just getting better at tracking what’s going on.

“That’s great news, of course—but the ‘crisis’ argument might prove hard to shake, and that’s not great news. The persistent narrative that maternal deaths have been rising grows out of a counterproductive belief that doom and gloom is the only way to motivate change. Pregnancy *is* risky. The wealthiest country in the world could and should do more to prevent deaths and non-fatal harms, which are chronically ignored. Doing so will require being clear-eyed about what the evidence is telling us.”

"Let's clarify some things. The title of this article is of course misleading. 

Only 27 humans and 47 canines in this study. That's a VERY small sample and we don't know the demographics (I need to read the full study still). Could not be representative of the whole population it's questioning). 

Aaaand....
""The scientists were able to tally the sperm in the dog samples, but were unable to do so in the human samples, which had been preserved with chemicals. But they did find a lower sperm count was associated with increased levels of PVC in the tissue.""

This means that they didn't necessarily find microplastics in the male testes but pointed out a correlation.

As age progresses from 70 to 77, further declines in various bodily functions can be expected. Let’s detail some key differences between a typical 23-year-old and a 77-year-old, expanding on the previous summary.

# 1. Skin Elasticity

* **Older Adult (77 years):** Additional reduction in skin elasticity due to further collagen loss. By age 77, the skin may have lost more than 55% of its collagen compared to a young adult.

# 2. Brain Function

* **Older Adult:** Continued decrease in brain volume and cognitive abilities. By age 77, there might be an approximate 20% decrease in cognitive speed and memory from peak capacity.

# 3. Cardiovascular System

* **Older Adult:** Continued decline in heart function and vascular elasticity. By 77, heart function could be reduced by 35-45%.

# 4. Respiratory System

* **Older Adult:** Further reduction in lung capacity. By 77, vital lung capacity could have declined by 25-35% compared to young adulthood.

# 5. Musculoskeletal System

* **Older Adult:** Further loss in bone density and muscle strength. By 77, bone density could be reduced by 25-35%, and muscle mass could decline by up to 45-50%.

# 6. Kidney Function

* **Older Adult:** Additional reduction in kidney function. By age 77, function could be about 50-60% of that in a young adult.

# 7. Sensory Abilities

* **Older Adult:** Further decline in vision, hearing, and other sensory abilities, with significant variability depending on individual health and environmental factors.

# Chart Representation

Here’s a chart to visually compare some of these declines between a 23-year-old and a 77-year-old:

    Function                  | Decline by Age 77

"A lot of infiltrating drugs like this are basically just hyperpotent synthetics. 

 They're easier to cross borders and ship (higher potency = need less physical drug to get high, so smaller shipments which are harder to intercept), can be less definitively illegal (new synthetics or drugs used in other capacities, like these in vet medicine, often initially have less stringent laws against them which also lowers risk for dealers).

They can also end up being cut into known drugs (basically what contamination is), often to add more of an effect to a more expensive drug that's been watered down, or even if it hasn't.  Or they can just be sold + further additives to bulk up and sold as a drug they 100% aren't.

Most of this cutting/adulterating is happening without any testing and by people who have little to no experience in chemistry or pharmacology (obviously).  They also don't know exactly the potency of the original drug they're adding, and may not know if it's been adulterated at a previous point in the drug chain.

"This is a good article and good research, but may be bad timing - it's in reference to data ranging from 1999 to 2017\\*, but doesn't seem to address more recent rises in maternal mortality in the US tied to abortion bans and the subsequent impact on healthcare for pregnant women.

I'll see if the researcher has addressed any of that, but I'd be very surprised if that would be caused by the same issue of better reporting.

"Ozempic just pisses me off. From my understanding it doesn't fix the route issue, it's just a quick fix that backfires later.

Instead of slowing our lower intestines so we feel fuller, we should be focusing on why our metabolism isn't as sped up as other ppl.

And I REALLY don't want to hear ""it's about what you eat"", ""just don't eat as much"", and ""exercise"". I don't eat a breakfast, I don't even eat a lunch, I have 1 meal when I get home and it really isn't that big. I WALK 2 miles a day to get to work, 2 miles back to get home, and all the physical activity I have at work. I lose no weight. I eat 1 cookie and gain 2 fucking pounds.

I've seen people that absolutely scarf down junk food to a point it makes me nauseous, they eat breakfast, lunch, dinner with snacks spread out in between. They barely exercise and yet, they're super skinny and slender.

A co-worker of mine can eat a whole ass pizza and gain no fucking wait.

That's the issue, that's the point. You can get a lap band surgery, your metabolism still isn't fixed. You can get Ozempic, you're still going to scarf food down like a pig when you're done. The issue is people's metabolisms just aren't keeping up and instead of figuring out the genetics on why that is, we instead focus on quick fixes for now that end up failing later.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsdDUtSlpHSHZHaTd5RkpEeFMtYkYwR2N4bjl5bUZEWlk4MzlCelFENnFtZUNzZWgwa0lNbjJkNWpjVUs5TGRqdFozbVFYWk5SbVFsdk4yUGs2eDRXbkE9PQ==

"I found it interesting that my insurance gave a lower quote if I had a c-section vs vaginal delivery ($2.7k vs $4.3k). It made me wonder if people end up opting for that due to that reason. But for me, my 2 c-sections were not something I wanted.

My first one I labored for 16 hours before it turned into a fast emergency, he ended up being tangled in the cord including around his neck.

My 2nd one I’m currently recovering from. I wanted to do VBAC but due to my age (35), they wouldn’t let me go beyond my due date bc of increased risk of stillborn.

"They're kind of conflating a few things.

1) healthcare in Canada isn't denied because it's ""too expensive"".  It may not yet be approved or not approved because the cost:benefit ratio doesn't check out (so, incredibly expensive new drug that doesn't show strong evidence for improving the condition it treats), which can and typically will be revisited, but if it's approved on a national or provincial level as a treatment option cost has nothing to do with it at a patient level.  Considering if a 5mo hospital stay would cost too much money isn't even part of the individual pt decision-making process on the physician side, it's a non-issue.  

2) the controversy in Canada is over non-terminal conditions, not terminal conditions.  The man in this article has rapidly-progressing ALS, and allowing MAiD for terminal illnesses like this is not at all controversial here.

3) The issue is really around cost of living and inflation post-Covid.  Housing costs are a big one, food costs have soared here since Covid, and provincial disability benefits haven't increased to meet inflation.

Essentially, the argument is that the government also needs to invest in helping disabled people and chronically ill people live as well, by helping with housing needs and expenses.  

And the second part of that argument is that MAiD for chronic illness and pain during a housing and cost-of-living crisis is coersive, because it provides people with circumstances that may push them towards ending their lives even if that's not what they want to do.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsc0Q3YlF1cmRRWUpVQUZqcGV1QmVMSmROY3RjWVlVOE1DMlBBYlRYN1o5a241WGhjWk1vY3BzeEtGZlRjTmJFcElIQjdzc2w1UmEyczh5VVZUSjVkQXc9PQ==

"I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s being raised by an anti-choice activist and was in my local chapter of Right to Life in high school. I was actively involved in campaigning against an assisted suicide bill that ended up failing in my state, the same year it was passed in Oregon. Of course we were against abortion also. 

But I was too pro-life for them…. I left the group because the official stance of the national Right to Life is that “don’t have an official stance on the death penalty.”  My fellow members also refused to take a stand, and I told them I couldn’t stay in a group that calls itself pro-life but won’t take a stand against the death penalty. 

Now I live in Oregon, I’m pro-choice, and I’m still against the death penalty.

"[Pfizer](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE/) on Friday said its [drug](https://www.lorbrena.com/) for an advanced form of [lung cancer](https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/alk-lung-cancer) showed promising long-term results in a late-stage trial, which may help establish it as the new standard treatment for the condition.

The company’s medicine [helped patients live longer](https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizers-lorbrenar-crown-study-shows-majority-patients-alk) without seeing their cancer progress, and most people experienced that benefit for over five years. The drug, called Lorbrena, also cut the risk of the cancer progressing in patients’ brains.

Lorbrena is already approved in the U.S. for treating adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have [a mutation in a gene](https://www.alkpositive.org/what-is-alk) called ALK. Only [about 5%](https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2024/fda-alectinib-lung-cancer-alk-positive#:~:text=People%20with%20ALK%2Dpositive%20NSCLC%20tend%20to%20be%20younger%20and,related%20deaths%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Dr.) of all non-small cell lung cancer patients have the mutation, which causes cancer cells to grow and spread abnormally. 

But that translates to 72,000 people who are diagnosed with that specific form of lung cancer each year worldwide, according to a release from Pfizer. That cancer is typically aggressive and often affects younger people, the company added.

More broadly, non-small-cell lung cancer is a common form of the disease.

"**From the article:**

In the US, bird flu has now infected cows in nine states, millions of chickens, and—as of last week—a second dairy worker. There’s no indication that the virus has acquired the mutations it would need to jump between humans, but the possibility of another pandemic has health officials on high alert. Last week, [they said](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/hhs-advances-plan-produce-48-million-h5n1-vaccine-doses) they are working to get 4.8 million doses of H5N1 bird flu vaccine packaged into vials as a precautionary measure. 

The good news is that we’re far more prepared for a bird flu outbreak than we were for covid. We know so much more about influenza than we did about coronaviruses. And we already have hundreds of thousands of doses of a bird flu vaccine sitting in the nation’s stockpile.

The bad news is we would need more than 600 million doses to cover everyone in the US, at two shots per person. And the process we typically use to produce flu vaccines takes months and relies on massive quantities of chicken eggs. Yes, chickens. One of the birds that’s susceptible to avian flu.

We still use a cumbersome, 80-year-old vaccine production process to make flu vaccines. That process relies on injecting a virus into fertilized chicken eggs, where it replicates for several days. The virus is then harvested, killed (for most use cases), purified, and packaged.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJsaUo4S3hjeDNvWU9wUHY4TnNSX3lVSUdqRFhyOXliMXVNWW40d2xTMjdfeHlKd0kyaENCbXdmZjNkZ2NVaml1YXNhSS1tRGgwakdhTlQtdXJSRWllbWc9PQ==

"I’m so sorry that happened to you and I hope you’ve made a full recovery, but for the vast majority of women oral contraceptives are safe and effective. The pill even has some health benefits (besides avoiding the potential dangers of pregnancy and childbirth), such as reducing the risk of certain cancers. Women who smoke or have a history of migraine with aura are recommended to use a non-hormonal method of birth control.

Modern low-estrogen birth control pills do not appear to increase the risk of stroke.

Castor oil is taking TikTok by storm. #Castoroil has over 60,000 posts and Google searches for the plant seed oil have more than doubled since 2022. But while castor oil has many purported benefits, experts have warned that some of these trends can cause...unwanted side effects.

Castor oil is derived from the seeds of the plant Ricinus communis, and it has been used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes since ancient Egypt.

"Research yourself, and then ask your doctor about symptoms, dangers, and treatment/management options for treating ""hyperemesis gravidarum"".  I had this and it escalated from chronic nausea and occasional vomiting to vomiting multiple times a day and a lacerated esophagus by my 7th month of gestation. It either goes away at some point after the 3rd or 4th month, or, it gets MUCH worse. (Throwing up a toilet-full of blood is a super scary emergency visit to the ER.). Being nauseous all day for weeks/months, multiple vomiting episodes daily, and nausea/vomiting such that it is negatively impacting your life are NOT normal.

Starting resource for you:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3410506/#:~:text=Having%20smaller%20amounts%20of%20food,carbohydrate%20than%20fat%20and%20acid.&text=Protein%2Drich%20meals%20also%20decrease,and%20beans%2C%20are%20often%20endorsed. 

Stay on top of things and DON'T let your doctor brush off your concerns as ""normal pregnancy"" nausea.  Make sure that your record states ""hyperemesis gravidarum"" (either as ""suspected"" or as an official diagnosis) in case things become an emergency later.  You have the right to demand your doctor show you it was entered into your record and request a printout/visit summary showing this diagnosis.  This ensures they will not fluff off your concerns and know if you have a medical emergency due to untreated complications of your chronic vomiting/nausea later they could be held liable to some degree.

If the nausea and vomiting are enough to impact your life, it IS chronic, potentially dangerous the longer it lasts, and medically significant!!  Think of it this way:  You have literal acid bubbling into/up your esophagus multiple times a day, weakening and aggravating it.  Vomiting can and does cause abrasions.  Combine the two, and give it a few months untreated, and you risk deep cuts, infections, and significant bleeding unless your esophagus is allowed to heal.

Advocate for yourself!! As bad as it sounds, have someone else go with you to the next OB/OBGYN appointment and state that this is a REAL life-impacting issue--beyond the norm--and that you should be taken seriously.  A man, or older woman, are preferable.  Women are famously discounted by medical professionals as not knowing what is going on with our own bodies, being ""historical or attention seeking"", and having our issues/complaints downplayed or just ignored/discounted. Pregnant women even moreso because ""pregnancy hormones"" are blamed for everything. Sad but true.

I was given suppositories that worked well for preventing the multiple times a day vomiting and debilitating nausea.  There are treatment options that are safe for pregnancy, or extremely low risk.  There are also non-medication ways you can modify how you eat/drink to reduce the severity of your symptoms and some foods and drinks that are recommended for pregnancy nausea.  

The earlier this is addressed, the less likely the damage may/will cause you to have a ruptured or lacerated esophagus.  Don't be me and end up in the ER with blood dripping out of your mouth.  This is a pregnancy complication and needs to be taken seriously to prevent harm/damage in the coming weeks/months.  Be safe, speedy recovery, and good luck in a couple months with the delivery!",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJtZWFIdnFaT2hrVFRGZlVvVGs3Q3k3VVIzQmpscWRrc0t5UlNLSlZvZUlOUmhrbVFTVHhVblpKZHFVdDBiRkJfZkVic285MDVZMzNpenVjeEpzNzBiX3dmUmFiYlNkeHBROXZxYldsME9IOE09
"By Anna Skinner - Senior Writer, General Assignment:

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already issued 519 Class 1 recalls so far this year, fueling concerns from Americans that deadly recalls are on the rise.

A Class 1 recall is ""a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death,"" according to the FDA's website. When examining weekly data for Class 1 recalls through May for the past four years, the products listed most frequently were in the drug, food and medical device categories.

The remedy I always heard was not a lot of castor oil. It was like a couple of teaspoons in a large glass of orange juice. The midwife always recommended they take lots of slow walks and stretches, and keep being active. And if they wanted to try the castor oil, she didn’t object.

"The real answer is that unless you have something like IBS or Crohns Disease it really shouldn't give any major issues. It doesn't for me, and it shouldn't for healthy people. Problem is most Americans probably don't have a healthy diet and then it might easy to get unwanted effects because of things like a lack of fiber, e.g. eating enough vegetables, fruit, or whole grain products. Fiber really makes stool firm, if you don't eat healthy and already have loose stool it might make things worse. But the magnesium will not be the actual cause most likely.

For your body to absorb magnesium in the gut it needs to be bound to something called an amino acid. Magnesium citrate that was talked about is generally decently absorbed. And it doesn't give that much issues. 

Some people might take the cheaper magnesium oxide, this indeed can cause issues. In high doses that's literally used as a laxative, I don't recommend taking that. It's cheap but that might cause you to poop more because of the way it interacts with the gut. Take magnesium citrate or magnesium bisglycinate and there should be no real issues.

"Worse. The laxative effects of castor oil made it a popular torture method by authoritarian regimes throughout history. Colonial governments like the British Raj and the Belgian Congo inflicted it on disobedient natives.

It was often 'administered' after beating the hindquarters, forcing the victims to defecate on their open wounds and risking infection.

Depends on the leeching material that is the can and its lining.  I don’t know what’s wrong with US veggies the fruits taste like vegetables and the vegetables taste like nothing.  Wasn’t till I traveled to Morocco and ate the fruits and vegetables there that I realized something was up with our plants and most everyone else that travels agrees.  I think it’s refrigeration and early harvesting.  I can taste it in the mint tea I make.  Mint from the fridge vs mint from the garden.

"There was gain of function research on coronaviruses happening in Wuhan, with collaboration and funding from NIH. The possibility of a lab leak was and is very real, and would have been very damaging to NIH, Fauci and other key leading virologists involved. 

So Fauci and others took control of the narrative early on and called speculation about a possible lab leak a 'conspiracy theory,' and criticism of his actions an 'attack on science.'  

Now Fauci and other key players concede that a lab leak was always possible. Evidence is being uncovered that they deleted records in an effort to hide how they coordinated their efforts to shape, and mislead, public opinion. To me it seems scandalous, and investigating further is necessary to strengthen the public's trust in science.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJuU2JJSXY4aDUtSHpXalZXdV94VXZzc0p4SThGeDhfODdBQTdUX3ZiRHNqM1pSZTBWUXRuWWFhVFVhRGxzeDFhcFN2OGlySDl0ZXptZ0pLTkJleklEclE9PQ==

"Bro were you not here when part of Fox news and right wing voters flat out denied the virus exists and Trump said to inject bleach into oneself? This literally started with Rush Limbaugh stating covid will be the new ""it"" news to criticize and tear down Trump and after that it wad fucking over. All the politicization and denial and bullshit came from right wingers after that. 

Like do people have that bad memory? Today, Republicans lean on being all about economics about the lockdown because it's the rational argument but in the early days of covid, Republicans flat out denied the virus or its severity. There's even a news about a religious family wanting to sue mainstream media for convincing them the virus was fake and their family members died. You can't make this shit up. 

There weren't a lot due to it being a heavy blue region but there were some adamant Republicans who showed up at the ICU I worked at and a lot of them had the same general attitude with a shit eating grin up until the point they're seriously being told they need to do all this bullshit otherwise next step is intubation. I recall one patient even laughing and going sure until he desatted even while proning.

Fwiw you can criticize Biden administration but mostly Kamala Harris for an ignorant statement about vaccines but they have generally followed experts advice that can be validated by many working in the field.

"You've perfectly described the problem.

* Even the best labs still have accidents.
* These accidents can be deadly.
* These accidents are kept secret from the public.

If the COVID virus did come from a lab leak, that *accident* has killed over 7 million people so far. And China has been [outright hostile](https://apnews.com/article/china-covid-virus-origins-pandemic-lab-leak-bed5ab50dca8e318ab00f60b5911da0c) to investigating any origin theory that puts the origin inside their borders. They're arguing that it must have come from imported food.

Without an honest and open investigation, which China will never allow, the source of the pandemic will never be determined and a proper response to prevent future pandemics will never be made.

Florida company is recalling whole cucumbers that were shipped to 14 states last month because they could be contaminated with salmonella.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared the announcement from Fresh Start Produce Sales on its website on Saturday.

"Depends on the product I guess. Science is pretty clear that there are no advantages to ultra-processed foods. (Typical foods you would not be able to make in your own kitchen, but have to be made in a factory). But there is a difference between consuming ultra-processed products just now and again, compared to having them as a big part of your daily diet. 

From a science study that was published just a few weeks ago:

"Tamar Haspel: “Language is constantly evolving, but you know a change has hit the big time when the AP Stylebook makes it official. In light of all the recent news attention to Ozempic and related drugs, the usage guide’s lead editor announced in April that the entry for “Obesity, obese, overweight” had been adjusted. That entry now advises “care and precision” in choosing how to describe “people with obesity, people of higher weights and people who prefer the term fat.” The use of obese as a modifier should be avoided “when possible.”

In other words, the new guidelines endorse what has been called “people-first language”—the practice of trading adjectives, which come before the person being described, for prepositional phrases, which come after. If you put the word that indicates the condition or disability in front, then—the thinking goes—you are literally and metaphorically leading with it. Reverse the order, and you’ve focused on the person, in all their proper personhood. This change in syntax isn’t just symbolic, its proponents argue: A fact sheet from the Obesity Action Coalition promises that people-first language can “help prevent bias and discrimination.” Changing words is changing minds.

People’s minds sure could use some changing. The world is an awfully inhospitable place for fat people—I know firsthand, because I used to be one. But I also know secondhand, because the discrimination, bias, and downright cruelty are on display for anyone who’s paying attention. Nobody with a shred of decency wants a society where fatness, obesity, high BMI—whatever you call it—is an invitation to humiliation and scorn. So if using people-first language really can reshape people’s attitudes, or if it really makes the world even just a sliver more accepting, I’m in.

I am not at all convinced, though, that a diktat about language will ever make a dent in deeply entrenched enmity; and although the push for people-first language is undoubtedly well-meaning, there’s a whiff of condescension in the idea that people can’t recognize kindness and compassion without signposts put up by social scientists. Around every use of obese or fat or people living with obesity, there are lots of other phrases, and it’s those other phrases—not the people-first or people-last ones—that convey how the writer or speaker feels about fatness.”

"Saying I don't believe you when you said ""I went to the moon and saw a dragon"" is not me being mean, disrespectful or any of that. Same kind of deal here, a doctor acting like they don't believe the patient isn't them being mean, disrespectful. 
Yeah, it's unfortunate that the doctors didn't believe her, I'm just saying I understand why, plus let say the doctors did believe her, and then they look into it, do all the tests, and then they find out the patient lied and wasted their time. Which most likely would happen. So 99% of the time a patient claims ""I don't drink"" and there is evidence. And since auto brewery syndrome is extremely rare with very limited reports then yeah of course I'm jumping straight to ""you're not being honest with me"" bc it would be foolish for me to believe a patient and waste my time, and their time, and money.

Artificial intelligence doctor would have diagnosed this much faster, as long as it doesnt behave like a human doctor.

- We found alcohol

-- I dont drink

- Are you sure?

-- I havent had a drink in 3 years

- Process of elimination process of elimination... Back and forth questions and answers...

-- There is a rare condition in which the liver or whatever produces alcohol on its own. Go get checked, however that would be confirmed

It would be discovered fairly quickly. But it will take a helluva lot longer in time and money and suffering for the patient when the doctors treat the patient like an animal.

The doctors benefit from this, because they make more money from multiple visits. Thats why they do it in part.

This is why when AI truly hits it will replace a lot of what the doctors do. Human doctors cant compete with a doctor who doesnt treat his patients like animals, and it knows everything humanity knows.

"My contribution to this thread is as follows.  If you have this condition and are trying to quit, eat foods that are low fat and low fiber when you quit.  Most of the reason why the vomiting occurs is the slowing of your digestive system.  I recommend mashed potatoes.  If you can use another anti-emetic like Promethazine, do so.  It's night and day the difficulty in quitting when you don't know the correct food to eat.

  
I was initially diagnosed with gastroparesis, after they did a gastric emptying study because no one had ever heard of this before.  About 6 months after the diagnosis, I read the white paper on CHS, and I just had to know, so I quit.  After 3 weeks I was eating whatever I wanted with no issues.

  
Again, when trying to quit, I cannot stress enough eating foods that are low in fat, and low in fiber.  I would even recommend eating as little as possible the day leading up to, and the first 3-4 days of quitting.  It is a night and day difference in how difficult it is to quit.  Stay disciplined in your diet for that first 1 - 2 weeks.  After about a week you will start to feel quite a bit better, after two weeks you might be able to start eating mostly what you want.

I hope someone that is trying to quit reads this and it helps them.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvc2s0dm9fZUw4NDdGeUI0djNUU0EtSVpnSVo4bFBNaWtpQ3BjYjl1VmVwVmhEb2FCUVU2RGhvLVVfOWhJVkhrY3hIcXBWejVhcGZyYU1EdTk4U21FSlE9PQ==

"# ""Abstract

# Background

Novel plant-based meat and dairy alternatives are designed to mimic and replace animal sourced products, yet their nutritional composition differs to traditional alternatives such as legumes and beans. The nutritional impacts of switching from animal sourced to traditional or novel plant-based alternatives remains unclear.

# Objective

To model the impact of partial and complete substitution of animal sourced meat and dairy products with traditional or novel plant-based alternatives on diet quality and nutrient adequacy in a nationally representative sample of Australian adults.

# Methods

Dietary data (one 24-hour recall) from the Australian Health Survey 2011-2013 (*n*=9115; ≥19 years) were analysed. Four models simulated partial or complete substitution of animal sourced meat and dairy with traditional or novel plant-based alternatives. Diet quality was assessed using the Dietary Guideline Index (DGI), and nutrient adequacy was determined using age and sex-specific nutrient reference values. Modelled diets were compared to a baseline diet using survey weighted paired t-tests.

# Results

DGI scores improved by between 0.3% to 6.0% for all models across all sex and age groups compared to baseline. Improvements in diet quality were greatest for the complete substitution to traditional alternatives (5.1% average increase in DGI). Overall, inclusion of plant-based alternatives (complete or partial) decreased saturated fat and increased dietary fibre. Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased to below adequate intakes for all complete substitution models. Substitution with traditional alternatives deceased sodium and increased calcium, while substitution with novel alternatives increased sodium and decreased calcium.

# Conclusions

All models using traditional alternatives, and the partial substitution using novel alternatives showed small but statistically significant improvements in diet quality. Nutrient adequacy varied between models, with nutrients including saturated fat, sodium, calcium, and long-chain fatty acids implicated. Findings highlight the importance of informed choices when switching to traditional or novel plant-based alternatives to prevent sub-optimal dietary intake.""

"Here's a preview of the article: 

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States — and new projections find it may become even more common in the next 30 years.

In a report released Tuesday, the American Heart Association says more than 6 in 10 U.S. adults (61%) will have some type of cardiovascular disease, or CVD, by 2050. This is particularly driven by a projected 184 million people with hypertension, or high blood pressure, which is expected to increase from 51.2% in 2020 to 61% in 2025.

""Clinically, cardiovascular disease is identified as a number of specific conditions, including coronary heart disease (including heart attack), arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), valvular disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, stroke and hypertension,"" the association defines in its report. ""However, high blood pressure is also known as a major risk factor contributing to both heart disease and stroke.""

"That's not wrong but the gun analogy is a bit weird. The gun was made to shoot and fire on something. BMI wasn't made to create bias, it was meant to help narrow down an approach to treatment.

BMI isn't meant as this all-encompassing, flawless metric system. Good metric is just a phrasing to say it's what we use to measure the likelihood of something and thus we should test for it.

The reason for this is it's generally detrimental and counter productive to run tests on something like Kuru; something you don't see at all anymore (unless there's evidence of cannibalism). The reason why people might ask if you've recently traveled to X or Y region is to help narrow down the problem. BMI is sort of like that; it's a soft-metric that helps narrow down things. Reality is BMI is more like a metric the way medical history/health questions serve as a metric. There was a case where candida a. infections went up and it eluded physicians. But reality was that the physicians weren't BAD, it was that at the time it wasn't exactly heard of that people would get candida infections.

NOW, they revised their approach. This is why information regarding the community you live in also matter and why people support things like sewage research team to study pathogens in our waste system to keep track of what's going around so we can catch things like viral shedding or the like and can keep track of what's largely common and present within a community.

"I mean yeah but what exactly are you debating here? BMI itself is bad/wrong or that the way all statistical data is compiled is bad/wrong? Because BMI is inherently really not any different from statistical data. The numbers on their own are fairly worthless and can even be used to spread misinformation whether by mistake or malicious intent. Statistical data require context to discern what those numbers mean and even then it doesn't tell the full story.

BMI is much the same way. It wasn't meant to be this all encompassing utility to be able to accurately depict a patient individually on their own. Otherwise providers would not ask you your family health history or medical history questions. Because in an ideal world, all that data is used in conjunction with data such as BMI to plan for what might be needed. If the patient has been struggling with high BMI for over a decade and seem to have respiratory issues, you'd get the BIPAP machine for said patient even if they have not had any COPD issues in the past.

Everything is to help narrow it down. No data in healthcare on their own is perfect and generally you need multiple confirmation on diagnostic tools to confirm something.

BMI is nowhere near the same line of thinking as ""black people have thicker skin."" It's an objective measurement of your mass and height.

"One criterion for metabolic syndrome, which is a much more useful diagnosis than obesity IMO, is waist circumference. Excess fat carried around the waist is much more dangerous metabolically than excess fat carried elsewhere. It makes sense that excess waist circumference is correlated with insulin resistance, which is another criterion for metabolic syndrome.

People with high BMIs that have low body fat but high lean muscle mass, which is the category that it's the most misleading for, tend to not have excess fat carried around the waist. The higher weight comes from lots of muscle, not fat, and even the bodybuilders with the biggest abs don't have enormous waists the way their legs and arms get jacked up. 

Of course WHR is ALSO a screening tool, as is waist-hip ratio, but both would be more predictive of metabolic syndrome than BMI.

"> I mean yeah but what exactly are you debating here? BMI itself is bad/wrong or that the way all statistical data is compiled is bad/wrong? 

That all indexes used to capture information will lose something, which is why they’re most useful for a population level overview because the losses can cancel each other out

When applying indexes to individual cases, that doesn’t happen because the loss is due to specific factors and those can be replicated systemically from a source we didn’t control for

For example, BMI may not be great to describe any particular individual’s relationship with fat or weight, but an increase in average BMI in the entire population obviously points to a problem

So if we have better indexes, we should move, and we should also remain skeptical of that new one

> BMI is nowhere near the same line of thinking as ""black people have thicker skin."" 

Right, that’s what *I’m* saying.

"Cobbs claims ""Poppi does not contain enough prebiotic fiber to 'cause meaningful gut health benefits for the consumer from just one can'. The complaint alleges Poppi sodas only contain two grams of prebiotic fiber, which means 'a consumer would need to drink more than four Poppi sodas in a day to realize any potential health benefits. However, even if a consumer were to do this, Poppi’s high sugar content would offset most, if not all, of these purported gut health benefits.'""

Poppi has never stated that drinking 1 can per day would drastically change your gut health. Second - you should not be reliant on this drink to be your main or only form of prebiotic fiber. Three - poppi's high sugar content? they literally contain 5g of sugar per can whereas coke has 39g. Four - poppi's cans are straightforward with the amount of fiber they contain: 2g. Fiber supplements are also dosed in 2g serving size why is this a problem for poppi?

This lawsuit is coming from a woman who has worked in law for almost her entire career and knows that she is able to exploit a loophole she's found. Supplements are not regulated by the US whereas food/beverage is. This allows her to create this lawsuit and go after a company that is helping people give up traditional sodas and trade them out for this alternative.

If you're interested here are some comments from registered and licensed dietitians about this lawsuit:

**Pros:**

Reduced Sugar Content: In contrast to typical sodas, which often contain 40-70 grams of sugar, Poppi boasts less than 5 grams of sugar per serving. 

Fiber Content: Poppi offers 2 grams of fiber, surpassing the fiber content of any other soda I'm aware of. 

Potential Health Benefits: Though ""gut health"" lacks a standardized definition, Poppi's lower sugar content compared to regular sodas could be considered a gut-friendly feature.

**Cons:**

**Not a Magic Solution**: **No single beverage or food can fully address all gut health concerns. A well-rounded diet incorporating diverse fiber sources is essential.** 

Possible Side Effects: Excessive consumption of inulin may result in symptoms such as gas, bloating, and diarrhea. As always, moderation is crucial.

Overall, while it presents itself as a healthier option to conventional sodas, Poppi shouldn't be solely relied upon for gut health purposes.

**A note on Olipop and other prebiotic sodas:**

Poppi may also be a better alternative to some other Prebiotic sodas like Olipop. Olipop contains 3g of sugar and 9g of fiber from Jerusalem artichoke and chicory root. It also includes agave syrup and cassava root. These ingredients can be triggering to the gut on their own, especially in excess, but also in combination with one another which is something to be mindful of.

Label reading is definitely important when we're looking at these types of products!

**Things to note:**

Poppi contains fiber, a prebiotic, not a live probiotic. These terms can be confusing to the average consumer. I personally don't think Poppi is harmful if it means a consumer will drink this instead of a can of Coke or another soda. There would be a huge reduction in added sugars. A lot of kombucha drinks also have small amounts of added sugars, however we can have some added sugar in our diets, just not too much. And that there are other benefits tied to that drink, as opposed to regular soda.

One thing I really want people to takeaway: this does not mean you should stop drinking Poppi. Especially if it is helping curb some of your other cravings for higher sugar or caloric alternatives.

"Yeah I absolutely hate doctors like that. I mentioned in another comment of an example where a patient may feel chronic pain and be skinny. Then when they gain weight, the doctor then blames the chronic pain they had to the weight gain and say ""maybe you should try losing weight"" only looking at the BMI and then stop listening to the patient, adamantly tunnel visioning on the conclusion it's due to weight gain.

There is a reason why I keep telling them BMI is a screening tool and really not all that reliable at finding out what's wrong. It just narrows down the search of what kind of tests it needs to run.

In that sense, aka practical sense of how it's applied in healthcare, it's virtually exactly the same thing as BMI. It's a screening tool. And that's my point. People are out to criticize BMI saying it eludes doctors. But in that anecdotal instance of your friend, that doctor isn't using BMI the way he should. He's simply not listening to the patient and that would make it user error would it not? I'm genuinely trying to ask people criticizing BMI what exactly are they criticizing and every single one of them has been more about a problem with doctor's behavior rather than BMI as a tool itself.

Listen I work in patient care. I'm in nursing. I get that I'm not smarter than a doctor or at authority to dictate what's fact or not. But absolutely NONE OF US looks at the patient's BMI when pulling up their charts on the EMR. Yeah the info is there and we actively do things like bed scale for daily weights and we do make sure we get objective data for height and such. And the EMR calculates the BMI for us. That BMI is not something that is ever specific or useful in any kind of patient care procedure. But say you get a patient that does not speak and we have absolutely 0 information about them. Their BMI is high so we can naturally run tests for things people with high BMI might have as well as the implications of overweight/obesity. But absolutely no one is calling a muscular patient obese based on BMI in an acute care setting. This kind of bullshit only happens in PCP offices where doctors don't even so much as look at the patient and just wants to get you out the door ASAP because time is money for them.

Studies presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) found that these drugs also halve the mortality rate over 15 years and reduce the recurrence of breast cancer. The findings suggest that weight-loss drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs), could change the approach to obesity management and cancer prevention.

"I completely agree with being cautious because biases exist in all facets of healthcare and it can be dangerous. This isn't a stance where I'm saying if it ain't broke don't fix it but it sounds like a lot of the problems people have with BMI isn't BMI in itself, but it's the care provider's behavior. Even nursing students know the adage one shoe size does not fit all. So you got doctors here looking at BMI, then looking at a clearly not obese patient and then stating that the patient is obese and should try losing weight. Why are we using these doctors as the primary example? I wouldn't trust these MDs to perform CPR with me during a code. Once a doctor tried to tell me to walk a patient to the bathroom. They can't fucking walk to the bathroom and has a broken hip; she moves slightly in bed she's gonna be screaming for hours. This wasn't our resident, this was our attending.

BMI is barely a footnote in our EMR records. At least with the residents and attendings I work with, absolutely no one looks at a muscular or athletic patient and says they need to get their BMi out of control. I think the difference may be this is an acute care setting. We're getting 800 lb patients here, no one in this floor would use BMI to say you're obese when more than half of our patients in a non bariatric floor are obese.

At the same time, even if we exclude BMI from our screening tool, A LOT of people that do not look overweight are truly in the overweight category. The problem is people often conflate being overweight as just another way to say obese and take offense when they're told they're pre-overweight category and need to lower weight as a precautionary conclusive note to the appointment.

"Teens who spend lots of time on social media have complained of feeling like they can’t pay attention to more important things like homework or time with loved ones.

A new study has possibly captured that objectively, finding that for teens [diagnosed with internet addiction](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/internet-addiction-teen-brain-activity-wellness/index.html), signaling between brain regions important for controlling attention, working memory and more was disrupted.

The findings [are from a review](https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.), published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Mental Health, of 12 neuroimaging studies of a few hundred adolescents ages 10 to 19 between 2013 and 2022.

“The behavioural addiction brought on by excessive internet use has become a rising source of concern since the last decade,” the authors wrote in the study.

The criteria for clinical diagnosis of internet addiction in the included studies were “one’s persistent preoccupation with the internet, withdrawal symptoms when away from the internet, and sacrificing relationships (for) time to spend on the internet over an extended period of time (e.g., 12 months),” said Max Chang, first author of the study and outreach case manager at the nonprofit Peninsula Family Service in San Francisco, via email. “The pattern of behaviour results in significant impairment or distress in the individual’s life.”

Given the changing state of adolescent brains compared with adults, the authors felt understanding the impacts of internet addiction on the teenage participants’ brains was vital.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvREQtcmRFbmIyZmZLZVhRSDVleElGN3FaelJKMmdpQ0JzM2JhdklCM2cyNXFiV0FVcjY1VHotX2Fma3M0S1pNelNyRUg5LVFkLVNlMWpUSVUtVjVpWmc9PQ==

"Yes, it's user error. But because WHR more accurately predicts metabolic syndrome than BMI, the risk of user error is lower. 

There is endless user error in healthcare, that's why healthcare-associated infections and injuries are so high and quality control is a constant issue. Yes, in a better world we could blame and educate the user, but in real life it's easier to put in place safeguards, redundancies, and protocols that mitigate the inevitable user error.

American healthcare spends disproportionate, and crazy, amounts of money of acute care while if it invested more in preventative care and managing chronic conditions, it wouldn't have to.

"I'm not against using WHR. I just don't understand how much of a difference people expect it'll make.

Because BMI criticism is that it seems to flag patient for further investigation for health risks associated with weight gain. In practice, what do people think using WHR will look like in either acute care setting or preventative care? In principle it'll be exactly the same thing BMI does. It's going to screen the patient indicating them to be tested for X or Y health risks. Since BMI criticism is that it's overdone more than it should be, BMI will flag more people to be tested for health risks associated with weight gain when they shouldn't be or at least that's the criticism. My argument was that it's not BMI that flags it, it's doctors not even doing the bare minimum of their job like observing the patient and listening to them and using the data gleaned from this interaction to make judgment.

Instead, the user error made with BMI is when doctors become stat-jockeys and only look at the numbers. And when you got doctors who do this, using WHR won't make any difference. It'll bring the same exact issues. So my criticism isn't on WHR itself, it's more about people's expectations out of it. It's not going to make a huge difference.

Like for example, in both BMI and WHR case we will definitely have situations where doctor is told the patient is pregnant and will forget about it and conclude they are overweight based on BMI/WHR. Sounds silly but that's the level of stupidity/ignorance you'd have to have to make a deduction based solely on BMI and stating the patient is obese. When people are bringing these examples or anecdotes to argue that BMI doesn't work, these examples aren't proving BMIs are bad, they're showing that healthcare workers in question are just really terrible and basically negligent.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvd2g4Y2FkdWpqeklhZmhfUDlzWG5FY21SWUNtT0FpQkVJX2pzbkgwSTFHekNfNXpDS3pIWVdSejJqTDFnOUhyYU1OQ2FIR2ZpUFFSZHBsUFRld0gyQ0E9PQ==

"‘This comprehensive review underscores the potential of dietary phytochemicals in cancer prevention and therapy. These bioactive compounds offer promising complementary strategies to traditional cancer treatments by targeting multiple molecular pathways involved in carcinogenesis. 

Further research is essential to fully understand their mechanisms and to develop effective phytochemical-based therapies for cancer prevention and treatment.

The dominance of conventional medical approaches and the hesitance to deviate from established norms perpetuates reluctance toward embracing alternative preventive measures. Furthermore, the influence of commercial interests and the marketing of pharmaceutical solutions can overshadow the potential of dietary interventions, fostering a climate where natural solutions are viewed with skepticism. 

As we navigate these barriers, a holistic approach that amalgamates rigorous scientific scrutiny, education, and cultural shifts is essential to surmounting the resistance and fostering a broader understanding of the transformative role that dietary phytochemicals can play in the realm of cancer prevention.’ [Exploring the Potential of Dietary Phytochemicals in Cancer Prevention: A Comprehensive Review](https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2572-5505/JERP-2023-00050)",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvYlJyUjRLa0tYbWxNbjlZNlBESTU5VjItSlM5dFRGY0JKakxxSFV6VVNCNnR4b01Bc3Y1WjdEZnB4UndVV1o1R3FJTGEyVWhpLXlQSExoemt0UWI4THc9PQ==

"It really does. Anecdotal evidence but I felt noticeably better when I stayed off my phone for a long period of time. I'm a very self aware person and I always self assess how I'm feeling. 

Whenever I got on a FB/Reddit/Insta binge, I always end up feeling stressed and anxious. For Reddit, it's full of doom and gloom news and people just toxicly venting their frustrations. For Insta/FB, its subconscious comparison of yourself to others. I try to be reasonable and objective but it does harm your self esteem bit by bit. And for some reason, getting away from the screen causes temporary intense anxiety. 

But when you stay off the screen for a few days up to a week, you start feeling noticeably better. You feel like you can finally breath easily and the world doesn't seem so bad. You start focusing on the people around you and the hobbies you have in your life. I started golfing, dancing, going to restaurants.

"Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and medical specialists at Georgetown University teamed up to examine data from Equifax on how borrowing habits shift in the years surrounding an Alzheimer's or dementia diagnosis, as The New York Times reported.

The study ""The Financial Consequences of Undiagnosed Memory Disorders"" aimed to investigate the financial impact of undiagnosed memory disorders on individuals.

Individuals who would later be diagnosed with dementia exhibited a significant decline in credit scores well before their official diagnosis. Even a year before diagnosis, this group was 17.2 per cent more likely to be behind on mortgage payments and 34.3 per cent more likely to be delinquent on credit card bills than before the illness began.

The problems begin even earlier, as the [study](https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1106.pdf?sc_lang=en) shows evidence of missed payments or delinquency on debts starting five years before diagnosis.

""The results are striking in both their clarity and their consistency,"" said Carole Roan Gresenz, a Georgetown University economist who was one of the study's authors. Credit scores and delinquencies, she said, ""consistently worsen over time as diagnosis approaches, and so it literally mirrors the changes in cognitive decline that we're observing.""

This research strengthens the growing body of evidence that aligns with the experiences of many Alzheimer's patients and their families.

""There's not just getting forgetful, but our risk tolerance changes,"" said Lauren Hersch Nicholas, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has studied dementia's impact on people's finances.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJwYUR4d0djY2szVVREZWVMWE5FLWZQdjlhZFZSTnNFRFpiVDRXY3RfNm12WlA4WWdwUVRvaC1McEFiNTVxNnFYQ2ZPeVh6aFJwN0wybmluQ1kxczJjTHc9PQ==
"A popular pastime on long-haul flights — drinking alcohol before dozing off to sleep — may present health risks even to young and healthy passengers, according to a new study.

The combination of alcohol consumption, sleep and the low oxygen concentration at high altitudes was [found](https://thorax.bmj.com/content/thoraxjnl/early/2024/05/03/thorax-2023-220998.full.pdf) to challenge the cardiovascular system and extend the duration of hypoxaemia, or low levels of oxygen in the blood.

The researchers at the German Aerospace Center’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine and Aachen University also said the habit reduced sleep quality and recommended that airlines restrict inflight consumption of alcoholic drinks.

Study co-author Eva-Maria Elmenhorst told NBC News that the team was “surprised to see that the effect was so strong” and recommended avoiding alcohol while flying.

Inflight sleep already exacerbates the fall in blood oxygen saturation caused by the reduced atmospheric pressure in aircraft cabins, the study states.

I'm heading overseas next month. In Schiphol (Amsterdam) two years ago, I was one of the few still masking. Earlier this year, most people masked. In a way, I'm kind of thankful that I was a CNA during the first wave because it helped me get used to masking for up to 12 hours a day (except when I'm on break, where we either were outside or were in our own spaces). I masked yesterday in a healthcare hiring event and I think only I and one or two other people masked. Boggles the mind. I'll never forget being in the covid unit that first wave. I don't care how stupid it makes me look, I'll never stop masking. 

The only time I got covid was because someone brought it to me into where I live. I was so pissed. All that time protecting myself only to get it at home because my elderly grandparent didn't mask.

"Here's a preview of the story:

Some veggie puffs made by Lesser Evil and Serenity Kids contain concerning levels of lead, a heavy metal linked to developmental and other disabilities in children, according to findings released Wednesday by Consumer Reports.

Parents may see veggie puffs, marketed as a healthy alternative to sugar-laden snacks, as a way to make foods like beets, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes palatable for kids. But certain cassava-based brands have excessive amounts of lead or other heavy metals, making even a single serving unhealthy in the case of one product, the advocacy group cautioned.

Consuming energy drinks may be linked to sudden cardiac arrest, a new study suggests.

Researchers at the Mayo Clinic have warned that drinking these beverages, which often contain high amounts of caffeine and other stimulating ingredients, can be dangerous for people with genetic heart diseases.

"It is mandatory where I come from, and I took it in high school and in university (for my particular field of study). I didn’t take it in English, though, so I haven’t got the appropriate vocabulary. Please, bear with me.

BMI was originally calculated for Western men in the 19th century. A population that was neither under- nor over-nourished, but it is not representative of many populations today. I’m biased here because I come from an ethnically rather homogenous European country, so for my population the stats will be representative enough. They won’t necessarily be so for people of non-european ancestry, or for women.

The measurement was arrived at by looking at said population of men and then finidng the normal distribution. That’s all. Now, by definition, the majority of a Western male population should fall within the Normal BMI range, unless they are over- or undernourished.

Hence, if you’re a man of European descent you’re unlikely to have a BMI of over 25 or under 18 (?) unless you’re over- or undernourished. You *might* have such a BMI without being over- or undernourished, to be sure, but you would be an outlier. So for the majority of the population, the BMI is a good rule of thumb. If you happen to be an outlier, there are other measurements that can be taken into account, as well. It’s smart to do so anyhow - but for the majority of people the other metrics will show the exact same thing that BMI shows.

And then that argument about elite athletes that obese people love to grab onto - there are fewer than 100 000 elite athletes in the world. That’s… not even 0.001% or sth like that? So yeah, most white men with a BMI of 29 are simply grossly fat. And at a BMI of 35 an African woman might not be as overweight as a white man with the same BMI, but she’s definitely not at her optimal weight.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ2bDZuWk0wMjdQQWoteUxMTU9LempxdFUteEJYNDhhZmlMNlhfaGFhWlpCT1lGYVZ5WDd4WU1maC13V0xnaFdCYmNwMmJaTzNOeThDZHp4VmN2MXFKNWc9PQ==

"Here's a preview: 

The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it had formally withdrawn marketing denial orders it had issued to Juul Labs in 2022, making it possible for the once-dominant e-cigarette manufacturer to pursue authorization for its sales.

The marketing denial orders were effectively paused by the agency not long after they were issued, leaving the product in limbo for years amid court litigation and ""additional review"" the FDA said it was conducting of Juul's applications.

At the time, the FDA had raised concerns over ""potentially harmful chemicals"" in Juul's e-cigarettes and ""insufficient and conflicting data"" it said the company had submitted.

"Syphilis is on the rise again, Rachel E. Gross writes—in a new, dangerous way.⁠

The disease usually has a series of stages. It “shows up first as a firm, painless sore on the genitals or inside the mouth or anus, then as a rash,” Gross continues. If caught in these stages, the cure is a shot of penicillin. When left untreated, syphilis can reach the brain, nerves, or the eyes. But now, eye symptoms are showing up seemingly all by themselves.⁠

⁠When eye-syphilis symptoms are the only noticeable sign of the disease, “by the time people do get correctly diagnosed, their vision might be permanently damaged,” Gross writes. Peter Leone, an infectious-disease physician, “is haunted by a patient who came into his hospital in 2015. The 33-year-old man had been experiencing blurred vision, light sensitivity, and ringing in his ears for weeks, but was misdiagnosed with a sinus issue … By the time Leone saw him two weeks later, the man could barely count the fingers on a hand held directly in front of his face. Leone immediately began treating him for syphilis, but he never regained his vision.”⁠

⁠“Eye syphilis ‘was a rare event before, and there seems to be a resurgence,’” Leone told Gross. “Sexually transmitted infections of all kinds are increasing worldwide, thanks to a long-standing lack of access to testing and treatment, increasing drug use, and falling condom use,” Gross writes. But syphilis is gaining ground with particular speed in the U.S., and although experts aren’t entirely sure why, one reason could be how highly stigmatized the disease is. Male patients “tell their mom about their HIV but they don’t tell their mom about their syphilis,” Christina Marra, a neurosyphilis expert, told Gross.⁠

⁠Some of the recent eye-syphilis cases might suggest a new eye-loving strain of the disease, but others are more worried about the fact that the disease is rising in new populations—heterosexual men and even pregnant women, for example. “We’ve known the cure for syphilis since 1943,” Leone says. “The true horror is that the U.S. has allowed this ancient scourge to gain a foothold once again.”⁠ Read more here: [https://theatln.tc/4h7d1mb0](https://theatln.tc/4h7d1mb0)

"Primary syphilis always manifests as a sore/ lesion at the point of inoculation. The most common places are on the penis or scrotum, on the labia or in the vagina, on the lips or in the mouth, and on or in the anus. People with vaginas and MSM that engage in receptive anal intercourse are the least likely to notice this symptom. They last in average 6-8 weeks.

Secondary syphilis manifests in a lot of different ways, but a few of the most common ones to look for are: sudden and unexplained hair loss (alopecia), palmar/plantar rashes, bodily rashes, condylomata lata (looks similar to genital warts and frequently misdiagnosed as such), or inflamed lymph nodes. Some of these symptoms can last months, but they will resolve on their own.

Early latent staging does not have associated symptoms.

Ocular, neuro, and otic syphilis can occur at any stage and will manifest as blurry vision or loss of sight, loss of hearing, or loss in cognition and/ or dementia.

H2H is possible, but I think smear infection from an animal, undercooked food, or unconfirmed animal contact are just as likely. It’s also important to note that H2H more often refers to sustained spread.

Syphilis has a long latency period after the initial symptoms resolve. A lot of people think that whatever they had just cleared up on its own. 

For people who do get tested, good luck getting treated. It seemed like every local clinic and health system was chronically out of the bicillin used to treat syphilis. A lot of people give up trying to navigate the system and having to advocate for themselves, especially if their symptoms seemingly resolve. 

Too many people don't know they have it. There's no way you can see a chancre in your vagina or rectum. Out of sight, out of mind. And there simply isn't enough testing done.

From the article:

Overall, Eskenazi says that there is still much we don't know about the complex connection between our changing world and how these fluctuations are impacting child development, with the role of factors such as microplastics and even climate change being very much unknown.

""I think we're still just at the tip of the iceberg,"" she says. ""We don't know how a hotter climate is affecting the menstrual cycle or even the role of social factors, pressurising girls to grow up sooner.

"This, I'm a fat woman. I gained weight during my 30's. I was also battling severe depression, and severe medical issues that weren't caused by my weight but significantly helped increase my weight due to the disease process limiting my ability to move, and the steroids I had to take to control it. I'm finally in a place both mentally and physically where I can even begin to give a shit about my weight. Intermittently they the decade there were time I literally did not give a damn about my size because I was so physically miserable dying earlier sounded like a god send. 

I'm just, in the last couple months, got off the steroids and able to move better. I dropped 20lbs just coming off the steroids without changing anything. I can no longer move nor have the same energy level as others due to my diseases. But the catch is you can't tell that by looking at me. You can't tell I have a plethora of medical issues and take 9 prescriptions a day just to stay alive and half way functioning. And sadly, none of those will go away..ever, and I would still have them even if I had not been overweight. 

Body positivity isn't about embracing being fat, it's about allowing people to love their selves in whatever form they currently hold. Fat people know they're fat, they don't need anyone telling them that they are. Yet when they go into society society shuns them like they're a leper and it's the 1700's again. All fat acceptance really is for the majority of overweight women is to be able to be in the world without some jack ass like yourself saying, "" she's fat,"". 

If you honestly believe that that is helpful language towards an individual then you are part of the problem that's causing many to hide from society and stuff their faces, instead of going out into the world and living their life.  That kind of hyperbole is the reason so many do not go to the gym. It's toxic. And frankly, it's rude and mean as well.

"I think you’re conflating body positivity with some weird sort of pro-unhealthy behavior philosophy that to my knowledge doesn’t exist (except in fast food advertising).

Body positivity means embracing my shape and size as they are while I eat healthy and exercise. Body positivity means if I’m fat I should be just as welcomed at the gym as a fitness model. Body positivity means I track my micro- and macro-nutrients to ensure I’m giving my body good nutrition because that’s an act of self-love. Body positivity means tracking my fitness gains in terms of what my body can do instead of my body fat percentage. Body positivity means eating a healthy amount of food and getting a variety of balanced exercise, letting the weight take care of itself. 

As someone of a “normal” size who has dealt with progressively worsening and now disabling chronic pain for about 20 years, I can attest that body positivity absolutely does NOT mean giving up and diving face first into a pie. It means learning to love myself despite no longer having society’s ideal body (I was a bodybuilder and that’s no longer an option). I’ll be 48 in July. I need to practice a lot of acceptance and self compassion around how my appearance is changing as I age. This doesn’t mean I’m telling people who are younger that they should look old like me, and it doesn’t mean I’m telling people without chronic pain that they should go out and develop some chronic pain that keeps them from their sport, but it does mean I have a choice to approach the way I think about my body with positivity or negativity. 

I can tell you negativity and self-shaming do not inspire me to take any better care of my body. The body positivity movement allows us to be kind to ourselves as we are while we take the best care of ourselves we can. It’s not telling everyone to be obese, lazy gluttons. It’s about telling everyone health is for all of us, and we are not going to shame people in larger bodies pursuing their best health outcomes.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3MDI4ZmNQRFdXZTZYdUxHd2VneGR6cDU3RXlLMW83YldINXdReG41MC05c0NoZ1FBNW1jMlBWcGgybXpqc200WUI0X0U4M0FPTW5xcDNXRDdGVE1TNUE9PQ==

"Katherine J. Wu: “Our most recent flu pandemic—2009’s H1N1 “swine flu”—was, in absolute terms, a public-health crisis. By scientists’ best estimates, roughly 200,000 to 300,000 people around the world died; countless more fell sick. Kids, younger adults, and pregnant people were hit especially hard.

That said, it could have been far worse. Of the known flu pandemics, 2009’s took the fewest lives; during the H1N1 pandemic that preceded it, which began in 1918, a flu virus infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide, at least 50 million of whom died. Even some recent seasonal flus have killed more people than swine flu did. With swine flu, “we got lucky,” Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University, told me. H5N1 avian flu, which has been transmitting wildly among animals, has not yet spread in earnest among humans. Should that change, though, the world’s next flu pandemic might not afford us the same break.”

- Hasty Generalization: You suggest that the majority of obese people from ""My 600 Pound Life"" represent all obese individuals, which isn't a fair or accurate depiction.
- False Equivalence: You're comparing the societal reactions to heavy drinking and smoking weed with how society treats obesity. These issues involve different social stigmas and consequences, making the comparison flawed.
- Ad Hominem: By calling people hypocrites who mock the obese, you attack their character instead of constructively addressing why such mockery is harmful.
- Appeal to Emotion: Your narrative is heavy on emotional appeal, emphasizing how cruel people can be to the obese. While impactful, it shifts focus from providing a rational argument to evoking emotional responses.
- Whataboutism: You deflect from the central issue of obesity by pointing out the acceptance of other habits like drinking or smoking. This move sidesteps addressing how we can improve attitudes towards obesity directly.
- Anecdotal Fallacy: Relying on personal experiences or specific examples from a TV show as evidence makes your argument less convincing. It doesn’t necessarily represent the broader reality.

"My adopted daughter struggles with her weight too. She’s extremely obese for her age (11) due to a history of food insecurity, adhd, and medications making her constantly hungry. She has autism and an intellectual disability, so she knows she’s overweight but she lacks self control and doesn’t really seem to understand cause / effect. No matter what we do, we can’t seem to get it under control. I know it’s not healthy. She’s completely obsessed with food and is always finding ways to get it, horde it, and binge.  She’ll wake up during the night and binge, convince classmates to give her half their lunch, beg endlessly for candy, over serve herself every single meal. Every time we think we’ve gotten it under control, we might go 8-10 months without weight gain, she’ll suddenly go on a binging spree and gain 10-15 pounds before we can get it back under control. 

She is extremely self conscious about her weight. Other kids make fun of her. She will talk about how she hates herself, which is heartbreaking.  We’ve done many, many therapies and the advice we have gotten is not to focus a lot of attention on her weight and to focus on healing all that trauma, so that’s what we’re trying to do. I just want my kid to be happy and for the world to not beat her down even more because she’s overweight. She’s been through enough. She’s obviously struggling. Does she really need another reason to feel bad about herself? Just leave her alone. 

My point in this is that you don’t know someone’s story. Obviously not everyone is overweight because of food insecurity, medications, and disabilities, but YOU DON’T KNOW. They have a mirror.

"Glad you took the nit-picking comment in stride- I thought your original comment was really well stated/important.

No one wants to be obese. I lived a similar life to people on My 600lb Life when I hit the most devastating depression of my life…but somehow, despite eating horrendously (living on nothing but tacos/pizza/candy/soda) for a year and basically staying in bed nonstop (aside from the 15hrs a week I was working) I didn’t become obese. I hit the genetic lottery. I know people who eat healthy and exercise, and they still struggle to keep their weight in check. They put in the work. I don’t. Sure, I became a pretty doughy, but it actually probably just took me out of the “slightly underweight” category and into “normal weight/kinda soft” for the first time in my life.

I was dealing with trauma and mental illness…but my genetics allowed my body to not spiral out of control.

People who think it’s all about willpower and willpower alone drive me crazy. It’s easy to say someone just needs to “try harder” if you haven’t personally experienced the DEPTHS of trauma/mental illness. Not all depression is the same- just because you’ve experienced depression doesn’t mean you can judge someone else’s experience with it- there are degrees of severity. 

I just wish we could all agree that no one would ever want to be obese, and so if someone seems like they “just aren’t trying/don’t care” it probably means there’s something else going on…and once you deal with that, dealing with the weight becomes infinitely easier.

Mortality rate for this strain of bird flu cannot be accurately determined bc it hasn’t circulated in human populations enough to be studied. Yes, bird flus have killed people in the past, but they’re also not frequently tested for in people with mild to moderate flu symptoms. Bc of this, people who get bird flu and don’t develop severe symptoms (like the small handful of dairy workers who only got pinkeye and recovered) get left out of the data on this virus, which artificially inflates mortality rates. If you’re only testing people with severe illness or post-mortem, the death toll will look much higher than it actually is.

"Risk = hazard X exposure. Minimizing exposure minimizes risk, even if the thing is harmful. For something like heroin, there is no safe amount of exposure (although heroin is a more concentrated form of opiate, and doctors DO sometimes prescribe opiates for legitimate reasons…. In moderation….). For red meat, someone who eats it once a month is encountering less risk than someone who eats it once a week is encountering less risk than someone who eats it every day. 

For most humans, it is simply not practical to ask them to completely give up something that’s been a part of their lives since they started forming memories. We accept a certain amount of risk living our lives every day, because we are trading risk for benefits. You’re exposing yourself to an enormous amount of risk every time you get into a car - so should you stop riding in cars?

"BI agree. No one should be making character judgments based on someone's weight alone. It's not just rude it is incredibly poor logic. On the other hand body positivity shouldn't make one complacent about their health. 

 Also I would argue that many entitled fat people label certain words, actions and behaviors as ""bullying or cruelty"" etc, because they happen to have had their feelings hurt.

 Being offended doesn't mean one is in the right or that what someone else said or did is wrong or ""cruel"". These people  weaponize the concept of causing offense as if it is akin to assault. For instance, when Person A comments on their OWN body and Person B gets offended it's not the fault of Person A regardless of how badly it might have made Person B feel.

 Or for instance if someone is invading my personal space like on the bus or a plane it's not cruel to require that they remove themselves. There is no justification for expecting to exist in my space without my consent regardless of someone's weight. 

A doctor needing to weigh a patient also isn't cruelty. Denying medical procedures that are dangerous for people of a certain weight is not cruel either. Someone being told they're not permitted to join in certain physical activities, like horseback riding or bungie jumping for example, because of safety issues isn't cruel.

"Context: I’m a clinical and basic science researcher (not on weight) and am a skinny person.

People have such a huge and complex misconception about body positivity.

There are so many comments here with the tired trope of “yeah love your body BUT you should still try to be healthier”. 

The research surrounding obesity and associated health issues is poor. Correlation does not mean causation. For the vast majority of these studies, BMI is used as the diagnostic tool for obesity. BMI is such a bad maker of body composition that it’s laughable—it doesn’t discern at all how fat is distributed throughout the body. Moreover, correlation- and association- type studies regarding obesity frequently succumb to collider stratification and reverse causation biases. Since there’s such a strongly ingrained view that fatness is bad, those associations are primed in researchers’ minds; in reality, there could be uncontrolled for covariates that are instead contributing to the correlation between fatness and whatever else is being studied. An oversimplified example: what if being diabetic causes people to gain weight, not the other way around? 

Much of the discourse and standard of care surrounding obesity has minimal or literally zero research-based evidence (this is actually the case for more things in medicine than you may think 😅). Taking your weight when you walk into a doctor’s office is nearly pointless, as it’s a poor indicator of overall health (save for necessary measures like anesthesia or medication). I won’t get into the whole obesity paradox finding because I’m unsure of the verdict (some of these studies also fall prey to complex statistical biases), but there is a good portion of research demonstrating that “excessive” weight can be protective against certain conditions and issues. 

I’ll clarify: some excess fat on the body can be bad, but it all depends on where it is. Subcutaneous fat (around the arms, legs, hips, abs, etc.) is not generally associated with poorer health outcomes. Visceral fat (deeper in your body, around your organs, etc.) is the fat that usually sends things awry in the body. The kicker is that being overweight etc. doesn’t necessarily mean that you have more visceral fat! Skinny and thin people who are in poor health can have higher levels of “bad” fat, too; general weight isn’t really as important a factor.

The problem with supporting fat people but still encouraging them to lose weight is that it can lead to something called weight cycling, a well-established phenomenon in which people lose and then gain weight back. The vast majority of people who lose weight gain it back because weight loss can trigger a considerable stress response in the brain that can overload your frontal temporal lobe and encourage you to eat; your body is essentially responding to a starvation response. This is unhealthy and damaging!!! Much like black/brown people and other discriminated minorities, social determinants of health may contribute far more to poor outcomes in fat people than actually being fat. Additionally, there’s some interesting research being done on the concept of a “set weight”— your body may already have a natural weight set for itself, and a significant deviation from that weight may cause undue stress on the body.. The stress of society looking down on you plus your own body’s neurological stress response of losing weight can destroy you. Dieting is disordered eating, and that’s disgusting. 

Also, the whole calories in calories out thing is pointless. Nutrition labels can underestimate caloric content by 60+ percent, and not all calories are even created equally!!! 

People also argue that being fat can limit you from doing enjoyable things. The problem here is that our constructed world (societal infrastructure, etc.) wasn’t made for fat people because of the inherent discrimination. Can’t ride a roller coaster? Try to shift the thinking away from “it’s because you’re fat” to “it’s because the roller coaster wasn’t made for you because fat people are looked down upon”. People could also argue that it may limit people from doing more natural things like climbing a mountain, but being unnaturally skinny can also limit you from doing things, too??? We all have a variety of talents, skills, and predispositions. Let’s be inclusive and celebrate them. 

You CAN be healthy and fat. If you eat healthily and exercise, and you’re 150 lbs, great. If you’re 300 lbs., great. Doesn’t make a difference. Skinny people can be just as unhealthy if they don’t do the above things.

"Who said moderation eliminates risk? Neither me nor OP. It’s like saying it’s okay to ride in cars. We understand there is a risk every time you get in a car, but you will catch very few people (in the US) refusing to get into a car or saying that we as a society should not be using cars. When someone says it’s okay to ride in cars, It’s not a guarantee that I specifically am going to be completely safe during my drive to the grocery store, I can definitely get into a big accident and die. But is it okay to ride in cars or not? That’s what I, and OP’s doctor, are getting at. People will see news articles/studies like this and ask their doctor, “is it okay to eat xylitol?” Which is when the doctor says OP’s quote. 

The original quote was “almost everything is okay in moderation”. I think both of us can agree that the “almost” includes heroin. There are very, very few things on that level of harm.

You’re correct that jerks will be jerks, but the difference between jerks and ordinary peoples treatment of obese people, is that a nice person will come up and call you a fat ass or laugh as you walk by, and feel very justified doing it!  That same person would never be a jerk or rude unless pushed to it in someway. They also wouldn’t go tell someone to their face that their teeth are ugly, that they’re gross because they’re bald, (insert any other physical quality).

"Clinical here as well. As much as you are making some convincing claims you are kind of diverting the attention from proven facts. Obesity does increase the risk of multiple diseases, MI and IHD, stroke, T2DM, PVD, sleep apnea and keep on going. This is not a unique cascading factor for this diseases. Genetics are just as important as well as other dietary habits, lifestyle and exercise etc…

Keeping this in mind in similar genetics, lifestyle and medical background, a person with obesity will have much higher risk of developing problems than somebody with a healthy weight for their body. 

It is true there is no need for all of us to look like models but people should be aware that poor diet specially on those with weight gain is dangerous. Advocating for body positivity in a bold manner is a dangerous game specially for those with poor education. People will use excuses to gain comfort and we shouldn’t give them one. 

Imagine if suddenly there is a campaign saying that smoking is cool or helps you concentrating. There will be a good amount of people that will smoke and excuse themselves behind those claims.

"To me body positivity is treating addictive behaviors with compassion, rather than shame, which as a clinician you may already know is statistically more effective. Body positivity is doing healthy behaviors, physically and mentally, and focusing on health, not perfection. It's saying rather than waiting to be a size 0 to swim at the beach, it's ok to go now. It's saying that taking a step toward being healthy deserves respect. But if you look online at fat people documenting their fitness journey, the reaction is often extremely body-negative. If we as a society make fun of fat people dancing and working out online in the name of promoting health, how does this help? The typical overweight fitness influencer's comment section is full of that. 

Body positivity means saying I love my body so therefore I will take care of it, rather than I hate my body so I will punish it by working out until I can't walk for the rest of the day, or starve myself until I finally cave and eat too much or win the battle and lose the war with anorexia symptoms. Exercise is good for you - that is not the debate - the debate is the approach. The default mode of western society is to be extremely judgemental of fat people, regardless of if they are trying to become healthier. Body positivity is saying fitness is about *health*, not about summer bodies, and healthy athletes are muscular and not necessarily skinny.  

If you want someone to lose weight, the solution is not command them or shame them into it. ""You are bad because you are overweight, so fix it"". I am not saying you think that, but the default mode of society is to judgemental to fat people, and the prevalance of eating disorders especially in women is proof of the pressure on people to *look* good. If you look at this comment section, and in general on social media, you will see the emphasis is on looks and hatred toward fatness.  If we want people to lose weight, shaming is not the solution, and simply telling someone they ""should lose weight"" doesn't actually provide any actionable steps to get there. This is why health coaching has an opportunity to help in this arena where a typical doctor faisl, because they provide a roadmap and encouragement, which is necessary, not just a demand of weight loss. 

I will share a personal anecdote. A few years ago, I hurt my spine very badly and could not walk. I could not get any assistance with home care bc a doctor thought I wasn't disabled enough because I could use the toilet. She was incorrect, but I didn't know it yet. When I couldn't walk, I ate shitty food, and I had previously been working out 3-4x a week and couldn't do that, so I gained some weight. I saw a spinal doctor and he told me """"you need to lose weight"". I looked down at the wheelchair and said, ""I can't exactly run a mile, can I"". ""Well, eat healthier "". Ok bud, you try getting groceries, put them away, cook, & do dishes, from a wheelchair with 7-10 pain and tell me how that goes. I did my best, but I ate a majority of microwable meals and non-perishable food to minimize my pain. I don't know how anyone could genuinely do better in the situation. This type of conversation with doctors is typical. If saying lose weight was enough, then no one would be overweight lol. So to me body positivity is ignoring that judgemental doctor, and focusing on what I *can* do.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3QjNIV2REYmdzQUhPQW0zNHJZNW9mNWVicncyVWs1ZUd1RzI2X0hfU2JDZFJmdG16N3VMQ0lXMHFNVFBXV0tqQXotNUZ2SW5FTFViZ0k1cXVoUUN2N0E9PQ==

What should we do, spoil and enable drug users and reinforce that what they are doing is perfectly fine?

"It isn't only about women first of all, and it isn't about health. It's about accepting a physical appearance for what it is to keep people as equals in society regardless of what they look like. What you're describing is more along the lines of fat acceptance, which people disingenuously use as a way to say obese people are living a healthy lifestyle. 

People in the public eye who care about or are involved in the fat acceptance ""movement"" absolutely use it as a way to justify an unhealthy lifestyle, and they actively push the narrative that your weight doesn't affect your overall health which is an absolute lie. Being obese is unhealthy. It isn't an assumption to look at an obese person and know that they are less healthy than they would be if they were not obese. Obesity is directly connected to every leading cause of death that involves your health. 

Also, being obese does affect other people, and it's selfish to not realize that. They use up public resources that they would not have to if they were in better shape. Obese people more often have chronic conditions that bring them to the doctor or hospital more, they make more emergency phone calls, they eat more food(not an unlimited resource), they are more often handicapped as they age, using up parking spaces and things like that they would not be needing if they took responsibility for their health. There are many ways that our personal decisions affect the lives of others. We don't each exist in a vacuum. 

So it's ridiculous and full of lies. It's a means for justification. There's nothing wrong with accepting that we have problems, physical or mental and we shouldn't lie to ourselves about it. That's weakness, not strength. I am overweight and have mental health issues, but I don't live my life pretending those things don't exist. When someone alludes to it, I know why and it just makes me think more about how I'm living my life. I don't try to convince myself that those people are wrong. Living an honest life is paramount, and necessary for long term improvement and happiness.

So a side effect of self-compassion (and guidance from doctors etc) is I take medicine to mitigate my cholesterol.

"Yes… so we used to make her a healthy breakfast and pack healthy lunches, but we learned that because she has Medicaid, the school has been giving her free meals.  So for about a year, she was eating 2 breakfasts and 2 lunches (the one we packed and the school lunch) without our knowledge. We didn’t realize the school was letting her have as much cafeteria food as she wants in addition to the lunch we packed because we never received a bill. So we stopped sending food to school.   

Then we found out she has been convincing classmates to share their lunches with her and she started stealing food from the school and after school providers (boxes of Oreos, candy, etc).  

Teachers, tutors, and adults who work with her on her services have all learned that she is food motivated, so she is constantly getting candy from random third parties as rewards to control her behavior, something we have tried to fight for years but it’s so widespread. I don’t buy her candy but she still comes home with literal bags of candy for x, y, z reason and then it’s WWIII when we take it away.  

She gets up in the middle of the night and sneaks food from the pantry and fridge. She hides food in her room - we do clean outs regularly and find food under dressers, behind her bed, hidden in drawers, all kinds of places. We’ve been advised not to lock up the food in the house because of her history with food insecurity. Her therapists think putting her on a diet or locking up the food at home will make things worse because it will create food scarcity and trigger her food anxiety.  

I keep lots of fruit and veggies and have told her she can have as much of those as she wants, but she will take whatever she can find - she will eat a whole box of cereal in one sitting, make herself 3 packages of oatmeal instead of 1 for breakfast, just constant consistent overeating and if you take food away or try to stop it she melts down because it triggers her. 

I honestly don’t know how to help her except to keep loving her. If anyone has advice or experience treating food trauma, then I welcome it. ",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3YktYUks3bGJNQUxDTEU0RUd2b09JdWtkZ0VXVkFIcVBaSURDMUN2bjJYUXJSSmdPZDNvdnV3Sl94M1pjd1lIOWN2OWdkbXJDQnlmVnVUVUlTMlB5VGc9PQ==

"I'm very torn on this to be honest. For reference, I'm a White guy from America who has English, Irish, German, trace amounts of Danish, and some Scandinavian heritage. I am the complete reverse of lactose intolerance. I can very easily drink a quart of milk every day if I wanted to and there would be no side effects. I eat cheese and sour cream with snacks. It almost feels like a super power to be able to process dairy products that well. I acknowledge though that those same products do have fat and sodium that could complicate somebody's diet. I would happily make sacrifices in other areas of my diet (limiting fried foods and sweets) if it meant I could still eat Asiago cheese and drink 2% milk.

I see no reason people shouldn't drink milk if it's safely digestible. I disagree with the statement in the article where they said that dairy is not ""necessary to the maintenance of a healthy diet"". Look at Mongolian culture. Look at Danish culture. They drink MILK, they don't all take 2 multivitamins daily to counterbalance the lack of dairy. Like it or not, 1% milk is neutral in the form of a dietary context.

You can never avoid all fat with milk; that's kind of how it works, but a person eating Parmesan cheese, to me, is not really straying from the path of health solely by eating it.

I didn't say increased education was a CAUSE of obesity - I said ""corrolation"" - that was a very deliberate choice of words. Obesity has increased at the same time that public education did. Despite it. 

The bottom line is that none of the research has been able to show a link between public education about obesity and a drop in obesity levels.

My bottom line claim stands unchallenged by you: public education doesn't change behavior when it comes to obesity. Because obesity is much more complicated than just deciding not to eat too much.

Do you know what BMI is? It's a statistical risk tool that can only generally compare an individual against a reference population. It is still useful to us in healthcare , but like any other tool it does not tell you everything and was never meant to. Equally, anyone who says we should scrap it is an idiot.

Here you go. The difference is that the waist to height ratio takes in fat distribution. People tend to carry excess fat around their waist and BMI does not capture the amount of excess fat that you are carrying.

Also, worth noting that Usain Bolt in the 2008 Olympics [was at the very top end of the healthy range of BMI](https://www.topendsports.com/events/summer/science/athletics-100m.htm).

"What are you talking about? I am telling you do some reading.  What do they say if your constipated you should eat?  It’s certainly not a big ass steak.  They say fibre because it helps pass through the system faster.

Your digestion rate is also based on what you’ve eaten. Meat and fish can take as long as 2 days to fully digest. The proteins and fats they contain are complex molecules that take longer for your body to pull apart.

By contrast, fruits and vegetables, which are high in fiber, can move through your system in less than a day. In fact, these high fiber foods help your digestive track run more efficiently in general.

"I have a similar story. For several years I complained about my lack of sleep and lack of dreaming so my GP set up a sleep study.  More than 20 but less than 256 electrodes were hooked up then I carefully got in bed and tried to sleep. My experience was that I tossed and turned and couldn’t sleep. In my mind I had been fighting the urge to get up and use the bathroom for a long time. I finally gave up and called the monitor to  help me unplug and what not. He told me that he was about to wake me because it was 6am and time to go. I had slept through the night. He wasn’t allowed to say much but did tell me that I slept a lot. When I spoke with the doctor he said that I had a normal nights sleep with REM and other good stuff and he had a hundred page report to prove it. My sleep perception was incorrect according to the doctor.

""The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between nutrition knowledge and body mass index (BMI). The General Nutrition Questionnaire was distributed to 500 individuals on the database of a large general practice. Results demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between levels of nutrition knowledge and BMI; however, a high level of nutrition knowledge was found among the sample. This suggests that a knowledge deficit may not be the most significant factor preventing overweight individuals from adopting a healthier diet and questions the utility of purely educational approaches to dietary behaviour change.""

"Doesn’t look like you read that, nor did you read what I posted as proof earlier. Which is particularly odd because it was pretty short.

For starters, it is making a case that education alone isn’t going to fix the obesity epidemic, not that it isn’t effective at all. 

Second, this is an opinion article that uses other’s research, not research itself. 

Third, the section where the author states the impact is negligible doesn’t have a citation, otherwise known as conjecture.

"Hey, thanks for the response. I think you’re misconstruing a lot of what I’m saying.

- Calories do matter, but I don’t think that the calories in calories out approach to weight loss is a useful or beneficial tool because of the complexity of nutrition, the variety with which food companies ascribe caloric value to food, and the unique relationship each person’s body has with nutrient absorption and energy expenditure. 
- I don’t think it’s fair to inappropriately overgeneralize my assumptions. Just like general health guidance (which is commonly prescribed and described by everyone), this guidance isn’t appropriate for everyone. If someone is morbidly obese such that it makes it difficult for them to move, that’s obviously a problem. To some degree, though, I think the relationship each person has with weight deserves some degree of autonomy, because it’s their body, and as such we shouldn’t reproach these people unconditionally. Again, there’s a lot of nuance here, as how someone treats themselves can also affect relationships with and the wellbeing of others. But blatant hate and disapproval is not the way.
-My entire response was founded on weight neutrality, as you even pointed out towards the end of what I said “300 vs 150 lbs”. I never said that that being fat is better than being skinny? Rather, I’d say that being fat is as equally morally right/wrong as being skinny. It appears to be a much less significant indicator of health than previously thought. 
- I never extrapolated my diabetes vs obesity analogy to cause of death? That comment wasn’t explicitly directed towards Mandisa. It’s a very interesting extension of what I said, but cause of death couldn’t really be boiled down to something as simple as that, I don’t think. Again, I’m not a doctor. I was simply saying that reverse causation is a very real bias overlooked in obesity-related research because of how heavily we assume that obesity and extra weight are bad. I’m sorry if that comment came off incorrectly in my first attempt. 

I do not think that my comments are dangerous. It’s important to challenge and clarify them, as you’re doing, but they aren’t dangerous. Of course there are negative aspects of obesity—I’m saying that there are negative aspects of all body types, and inappropriately emphasizing those of fat people is hurtful and maybe even dangerous, too.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ3VVdaYVl6ZXh5cllDY3RaVC1GQzdmTmhMWk1DMUNLTGUyRGNkelVTbXhpQks4aGx5QlpPWmowY05wZXpDVmRJNlA1VW00cHoyeWRqbWJxMnE3cE9IMXc9PQ==

Up All Night? You May Have Actually Been Asleep


You say you haven’t slept all night. Brain scans say you have. New science says both inferences may be right

Desperate for sleep, you go to a sleep clinic, where your head is fitted with electrodes to record your brain waves through various sleep stages. In the morning, you report that you barely slept at all. Yet according to the test—polysomnography, the gold standard for sleep measurement—you slept all night.

You’re not the classic example of a person with insomnia who waits for sleep to come, maybe checks the clock, paces, reads and waits for morning. What you have has been called subjective insomnia, paradoxical insomnia or sleep misperception. Scientists have doggedly attacked this stubborn puzzle for decades without result—until now. Now they say that you have not been misrepresenting your sleep; they have been mismeasuring it.

The most recent studies, using far more enhanced measurement, have found that many people with subjective insomnia show different brain activity from good sleepers—throughout the night. Neuroscientist Aurélie Stephan and colleagues at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN) realized that something unusual was going on after they asked people in their study to put onto their head a net of 256 electrodes rather than the typical six to 20 used in sleep clinics. In one series of experiments, the researchers woke sleepers about 26 times on average during the night. The participants were asked whether they’d been asleep or awake and what they’d been thinking about.

The most remarkable finding, Stephan says, is that these people showed pockets of arousal in the form of fast brain waves during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM is the stage in normal sleep when your brain should completely disconnect from the systems that keep you aware and vigilant, Stephan says.

People with subjective insomnia with this interrupted REM do not experience their sleep as restful. When wakened, they reported having had thoughts similar to those when awake—adding lettuce to their shopping list, say, or reminding themselves to call their cousin. They were less likely to have what University of Montreal neuroscientist Claudia Picard-Deland calls immersive dreams, in which you feel physically present in the dream world and are fleeing down a dark hallway, feeling the hardness of the floor or battling a dragon, sensing its hot breath.

In a study of normal sleepers Picard-Deland recently presented at the the Cognitive Neuroscience Society’s annual meeting, participants said they felt most deeply asleep during immersive dreams, which occurred in the REM stage. People with interrupted REM, as Stephan’s research shows, do not report immersive dreams. They do not feel they’ve slept deeply, and they report fatigue similar to that of people who actually sleep very little.

Perhaps even more important, says NIN sleep scientist Eus van Someren, interrupted REM is strongly linked to disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. If two people experience the same level of trauma, a good sleeper is probably less likely to develop PTSD than someone with disturbed sleep, he says. Those with disturbed sleep are therefore more vulnerable to developing PTSD. It’s a vicious cycle.

This occurs because interrupted REM interferes with the overnight dissolving of emotional distress that has accumulated throughout the daytime, which typically happens during good sleep. “Sound REM sleep is the only state during which the brain has a ‘time-out’ of noradrenaline [norepinephrine],” van Someren says. “The neurons are not firing anymore, so they don’t release noradrenaline downstream in the brain. But if you have even the slightest arousal from REM sleep..., then noradrenaline shoots up very fast.” He believes those with interrupted REM experience this arousal repeatedly and never reach the typical quiescent state that allows for the processing of troubled emotions.

A study headed by van Someren’s former graduate student Rick Wassing, now at Macquarie University in Australia,demonstrates this experimentally. The researchers exposed people to a distressing emotional experience for three days in a row: they had to listen to a recording of themselves singing—often out of tune—to karaoke, which aroused shame. As measured by their physiological responses, normal sleepers felt less distress after a night’s sleep. Those with disturbed sleep felt more.

The percentage of people with insomnia that have interrupted REM is unknown, but these insights are suggesting new personalized treatments for insomnia, which is now understood as existing on a spectrum. Such treatments may be especially beneficial to people with insomnia who also have depression and anxiety disorders.

Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the standard intervention for insomnia. People with insomnia learn to decrease their anxiety about sleeping and to employ behavioral strategies aimed at better sleep. But CBTi does not work for everyone. Those with interrupted REM, in particular, probably need different solutions.

One behavioral strategy used in CBTi—sleep restriction—does show promise for people with interrupted REM, however. Some sleep-restriction methods involve shortening a person’s time in bed to the average amount that they actually sleep per night. Other methods delay a person’s bedtime.” For example, If a person objectively sleeps for 5.5 hours, the experts allow the person to be in bed only for six hours. A preliminary lab study in which participants delayed their regular bedtime by two hours showed that such sleep restriction can reduce the number of arousals during REM. The researchers are hoping to replicate these results in a larger study of people sleeping at home.

This new science also opens the way for drug interventions. The NIN group is seeking approvals to test whether a beta-blocker typically prescribed to lower blood pressure might mitigate the effects of continuous bursts of norepinephrine. The researchers are also considering testing the blood pressure drug clonidine in the hopes that it may help the brain reach a more quiescent state.

Until these interventions are available, says sleep researcher Geoffroy Solelhac of the Center for Investigation and Research in Sleep in Switzerland, “just understanding that their sleep is objectively different is reassuring to patients. They feel a sort of relief.” Knowing all that may even help them sleep better.

"Please do send me the evidence as I would be curious to read this. The video is an essay with very weak and or miss interpreted data and conclusions. Just because it’s in pubmed does not mean it’s true or that there is strong evidence.

Yes indeed obesity is complex on its origin and it’s not only explained by one factor. There is and always will be people that will struggle to loose weight for multiple reasons some unavoidable such as AE from medication, metabolic disorders, social factors etc…Nevertheless this is not a generalised aetiology. A very good way to illustrate this point it’s by having a look at obesity rates in developing countries. 

Then there is the problem with accountability. It’s human nature not to accept fault or take responsibility. This is not an easy concept to weight. Just also think from personal experience, I could be much healthier if I exercised more and I changed my diet and I know this. The times in my life I have been healthier was because of personal choice. Multiple factors contribute for me to change my habits, stress, life situations, time availability etc. It’s not without accountability/own health responsibility that people quit smoking for example. So we should also not remove that from people or we will loose a big motivator towards a healthy lifestyle.


I have worked in stroke wards, maternity,  respiratory, cardiology, ED and GP settings with a 10+ year experience. It will take a lot of very strong evidence to convince me otherwise as this will contradict basic physiology of the human body. Not only that but just by maybe seeing a small amount of patients ~1000 there is a clear physical correlation between obesity and comorbidities.

"As someone who used to be fat, I think a lot of the difference women experience at their heaviest versus thinnest has to do with men being more attracted at lower weights and thus actually treating you like a human being. When I was heavy a lot of men just went on as if I didn't exist, which was fine by me honestly, but others were outright cruel and just completely dehumanized me. When I lost weight suddenly they were smiling at me, going out of their way to open the door for me, interested in what I have to say. 

That said, even your friends and family treat you very differently. Not every single person, obviously, but people tend to look down on you. They see you as someone who is not whole on their own, someone that has problems that need fixing and thus is worth pity and in need of micromanaging. It's hard to have meaningful relationships with other people when they view you as fundamentally lesser, not an equal. 

Imagine if all your friends and family were convinced they had a genius level IQ and your was below average. They're nice enough to you, but they don't treat you as *one of them*. 

I know this fucked up shit is engrained in our culture because I started to feel that way after I lost weight. I had to watch my best friend go through this too in our late 20s to understand it wasn't okay when it happened to me and it's not okay when it happens to her, so I stopped and started respecting her and her autonomy.

I’ve had to adjust my whole relationship to food and exercise. Now it’s only about *feeling well* and not about numbers on the scale or on my clothes.

"Now you’re doing mental gymnastics 🤸 

“Yeah there is a correlation between being fat and having [insert dozens of diseases and disorders] but that doesn’t mean causation” 
- except it’s been proven that obesity does have a causal effect on a ton of diseases. Secondly, if there is enough correlation it might be wise to consider causation is likely. 

“Yeah maybe being obese could put stress on your joints and make it hard to move but what if super obese people whose back pain is deemed to be a cause of their body weight have an underlying cause?”
- sure, they might! But there’s one thing we know without a medical degree; a fuck ton of weight on anything adds stress. Understanding how joints work makes it no surprise that over time, carrying 100-200 extra pounds or so would deteriorate them at an accelerated rate. 

and this is just an aside, but set rate theory makes sense to me- not an MD- to a certain point. No ones set rate is morbid obesity. It’s just not. It is so expensive for the body to maintain hundreds of extra pounds of adipose tissue, and evolutionarily it doesn’t make sense to say someone’s body wants to be so overweight they can’t even move by themselves or it will cause “undue stress.” If we are talking about someone whose leptin levels keep them eating enough to maintain say, a size 12 whereas another woman’s leptin levels keep her at a size 4, that makes sense to me 100%.

"Responding to all of your comments here.

-I mostly disagree with your first point. I think that sufficient correlation research should encourage further study of potential mechanisms but that caution should be taken to assuming causation. Fair to call that a conservative take. Additionally, I think that causal research between obesity and various diseases is still shaky, and much of my argument centered around the fact that quite a lot of this research is rooted in BMI-type analyses. I still firmly believe that BMI is a poor tool to investigate causal relationships between conditions because of the poor specificity with which it defines obesity and fatness. 


- Yes, I mostly agree with your second point. I’d be interested to compare joint degradation stratified by muscle mass in tandem with overall weight. I believe that there is a tendency for obese individuals to carry more muscle (not sure about relative proportion, huge grain of salt)…how does that impact or complicate the relationship between weight and joint pain? Also, I believe that there are still confounding factors that could equally contribute to joint pain in fat people, namely the tendency for increased weight to encourage a sedentary lifestyle. What if the lifestyle were treated instead of the weight? How would that affect joint pain. Haven’t checked research on this. Still, yes, extreme additional weight = more joint stress. Again, my comments are generally applied and shouldn’t be extended to extreme cases. Not sure what the extreme case cutoff would be, maybe 200lbs, maybe more? Really not sure.

- I agree about your commentary on set weight theory. I was trying to emphasize that set weights generally render dieting unhelpful and potentially harmful. Yes, extreme obesity is unhealthy because of the immediate implications on quality of life, and weight loss there may be helpful. I would still encourage a whole health approach to treat other issues that may be present.

I worked for two years as a cardiovascular researcher studying the effect of varying degrees of CAD on risk stratification, especially with respect to noninvasive CAD identification techniques, before switching to something more social sciences focused. Our research group frequently discussed the effect of weight gain on obesity-related conditions and comorbid outcomes.

Upon review, though, I made too extreme claims and am sorry. I still consider HAES approaches to weight and health management compelling. I still believe that weight is overemphasized in someone’s overall health. But yes, caution should be taken to overgeneralizing and to discounting a lot of helpful medical research advising against what I’m saying. Thanks for checking me.

"Oh yeah?  Look at Koreans, who were by 2010s taller by age 20 than Americans, without megadosing mega vitamins OR drinking tons of milk. Nearly 100% of the native Korean population is lactase non persistent - which is a better way to think if this and label the difference.  Not being able to process lactose after infancy is NOT a disease or disorder.

Being able to drink milk IS a superpower.  Cheeses, yoghurts and other fermented products, generally not.  The fermentation process almost always consumed all simple sugars that are available to the microfauna doing conversion processes and there is generally no lactose left in most cheeses, yoghurts, sour creams or any dairy products that is historically produced to be able to keep without spoiling.  After all, it's the uncontrolled consumption of what's most easily metabolized that IS food spoilage and the attempt to keep foods from spoiling is 90% of the reason we do things to food.

People's healthful consumption of dairy is not evil of cow farming that is going to kill us.  The insanely out of balance mass-energy resource consumption and resultant waste heat/carbon produced IS going to kill us.   Literally.  Personally, I love steak with bearnaise sauce and will get carne asada tacos at the taco stand every time.  But I also know I'm a part of the problem.

In any case, even having 2% of the population very suddenly die would be a huge issue. Especially since the quarantining isn't decided entirely by the individual.

"The public health messaging missteps of Covid are 100% bearing dark fruit (look at measles outbreaks, under vaccination of pets, etc). These missteps were capitalized upon by the active disinformation campaign that is the anti-vax movement. Additionally they show that the cdc is a deeply political institution which is absolutely not immune to mis/disinformation.

For those who care, just keep wearing your masks in public. It’s transmitted much the same as covid so N95s should offer excellent protection. Other than that be wary of places where transmission is high risk for Covid.  If we (the US)are the point of origin for a new spill over, it’ll look like wuhan but without the severe lock downs. So like New York but worse. Huge mis/disinformation campaigns will ratchet up again.  Not entirely sure how to mitigate that but try to find good news sources. I have a google alert for “ mystery pneumonia. “

But again you can mostly mitigate your risk by taking your covid precautions now and of course NOT DRINKING RAW MILK. If you are concerned, stock up on masks now and try to keep 2 weeks of food in your house. Keep an ear to the ground and try to worry over much.

"They’re growing only because their beliefs are spreading, not because they’re propagating.  

Once something like a virus starts cutting into a population’s base size and ability to grow via births, it will also change the belief adoption rate as people realize the error of choosing poorly.  

It’s like comparing the populations of people who stay in a combat zone vs. those who leave it.  The combat will attrit the population both directly and by reducing the childbearing age population to lower birth rates.

If the anti-vax crowd want to claim they’re not in a war zone while their friends, families and children start dropping all around them, it’s a true Darwinian culling situation happening.

Fortunately, with extremely deadly diseases, self-limiting is quick.  For instance, ebola - once it takes hold it kills so many people so quickly that they don’t even have the chance to spread it to a new area, so the infection stays localized.  Only when people travel between populations can a new population become exposed.  But the speedy onset of symptoms doesn’t permit people to move too far.

In the US, all forms of transit - mass and personal - are easily accessible and affordable.  

An ebola-like virus could spread from city to city fairly quickly and cause all kinds of horror.  But once it starts, communication is good enough that isolating outbreaks will be fairly simple - total lockdown - to stop a spread, especially if it has a 50% fatality rate.  

So the people who take precautions to limit spread will have the most freedom to move.  Once 50% of a whole congregation dies, will the remaining 50% keep attending?  That just seems ghoulish waiting for the next variation of the virus to infect them and cull another 50%.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4X05nSmVxZldfSW5FN3pQLW5KZVJDOUMwcERKNnk1WkVtYWhVaXY4SzA0d1RxbzJWdUlGdTZXZW5VZmM2NmFzY3N1R05tVjcwRjNDOEJ3dGo4RlVERF92R1VTXzEzamtEdkhwZmpNU2hpS0E9

"A dangerously naive statement; not only is it the type of thing that will be used to paint every pro-health advocate as bloodthirsty, further stoking conspiracy theories, but there's no guarantee the numbers will work out the way you described by any specific date anyway.

For example, COVID hit cities hardest first (left-leaning generally), to the point that, reportedly, some Trump admin officials considered this a boon:

""The political folks believed that because it was going to be relegated to Democratic states, that they could blame those governors, and that would be an effective political strategy.""

Of course, it didn't work out in their favor in the long run for COVID (anti-vax and anti-social distancing generally would't on a long enough time scale), but a pandemic like this may spread faster initially in more densely populated areas, and we need everyone on board to stop future ones.

We should be doing our best to de-politicize public health, not employing the same tactics as those who wish death upon large segments of the population for political gain.

"Likely not. Opportunistic sellers of oral supplements are 2 a penny. They use the flimsiest evidence to sell their product, and won't have a clue about how basic biology works, and if they do, they will still lie to sell their product.

Sorry, in my profession I'm cynical and very wary of these companies.

On topic though, yes I've struggled to find anything as you say. This article doesn't mention thyme oil, but it does give some background on other  therapeutic 'food' compounds, and goes into reviews of in-vitro (not dissimilar to topical applications as you mention) and in-vivo.

https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3277[https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3277](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3277)

Going on some general principles though, and points made in that article with in-vivo studies, the issues would be concentration needed to treat orally with the much higher risk of toxicity as a side effect, to cells in your own body. The active compounds in thyme oil may not adequately differentiate, and there's also risk of liver and other systemic damage with doses high enough to be therapeutic, which you would not get from eating thyme normally or applying a high dose topically, and the body is not used to coping with.

Tldr; this is a long way of saying, sorry, no I can't find any studies as you asked for, but also a warning to anyone reading this thread about believing marketing on supplements by unscrupulous sellers.

"What would happen is it would create mass paranoia and kill millions very, very quickly. It takes a few days or a week to get sick. All it takes is one person to go to a club or a mall and next thing you know, a 12% of your city disappears over night in 3 weeks. But those people spread it in the weeks leading up to it. Before you know it, you've lost 20% of the population before lock downs get very real. 50% of death means you will likely be shot on sight and the military will enforce it. 


Everyone complaining about authoritarianism will end up dying from believing a conspiracy because they won't take precautions.


Anyone without a mask or taking social distancing seriously might clean out a store. It would be a nightmare until the vaccine get made and sent out. Vaccine deniers won't survive or will be forced under penalty of years prison to take it. 


The American right will cease to exist. Partially because of a great Los of numbers. Secondly because anyone saying that it wasn't good or necessary will be heavily outnumbered by people who have seen countless people die around them. The government handling it well would probably make demanding of universal healthcare stronger than ever. 


If the government doesn't do a good job and cancels vaccines or selll them off to other countries while denying it, there will be so many dead people and traumatized people that the US would be incredibly dangerous. People with dead children will be out for blood against politicians who tried to ""stop the lockdowns"". Men and women with dead husbands, wives, parents, friends, and children will do far, far more then protest. I've had family members lose their minds over a family death that simply happens of old age. If the right wing fucks up that much, there will be a very high amounts of violence and instability. 


To put it another way. If you come down with a cough that's a 50% chance of a death sentence caused by a some one with power to fix it, would cause feelings of desperation. Desperation coupled with feelings of nothing to lose and a few weeks of living at best. At that point they might try to cough or spit on people they don't like. Or worse.

"Doctor here.  Health insurance is a scam, and our 'system' isn't really a system at all.

But please direct your anger away from physicians.  There are plenty of very large studies about this - physician salary comprises 8.6% of us healthcare costs.

""Administrative spending"" is between 16 and 30% depending on the study.

The administrators didn't go into $300,000+ of debt to attend medical school.  They didn't spend 4 years studying every waking minute in medical school to become a doctor.  They didn't spend 3 to 7 more years in residency working 60 to 80 hours weeks with 4 days off per month to become fully trained.  They aren't cutting people open or giving heartbreaking news to the dying.

I paid a lawyer $500 a few years ago just to look at a contract which probably took him an hour.  I paid that because he had the exact expertise I needed and that costs.

The specialist who saw you TEN TIMES wasn't only working on your case when they saw you.  The first 9 visits saying they didn't know what was causing it meant they had been looking over your tests and findings and bringing likely decades of training to bear on your problem.

And the specialist didn't make $1000 for treating you either.    A 99233 code (what probably was coded each hospital stay) pays a total of like $130 MAX by Medicare and most insurers. And again, that's not what the doctor actually kept in their pocket.  You paid the bulk of that yourself as your copay or deductible.  What would an expert opinion and evaluation over ten days been worth to you?

Your anger is justified but if the general public continues to point at doctors as the problem, there won't be any good ones left pretty soon.

"Do you not think physician organizations have attempted to do this?

Also, the opiod pandemic is a bit more complicated that  that.  But the administrators and those physicians in keadership influenced heavily by pharma did decide back in the late 90s that 'pain is the fifth vital sign' and then started tying physicians' reimbursement to 'patient satisfaction scores'.  So we had a system in which doctors are thoroughly incentived to prescribe opiates to make patients happy and in fact penalized when they do not.  But yes, it's again the fault of the doctors that they didn't just lay down and take the punishment when absolutely nobody had our backs when trying to get patients off of opiates until the public woke up to the problem.

"Here's a preview of the article:

Can a diet that's good for the planet also be good for your health? A new study is pointing to yes. 

In the study, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition Monday, researchers found those who most closely adhered to the Planetary Health Diet had a 30% lower risk of premature death compared to those with the lowest adherence.

Following the diet also had a substantially lower environmental impact, including 29% lower greenhouse gas emissions and 51% lower land use.

"I don't think it's that entirely. Particularly because millenials and younger, when they get diagnosed with cancer, often have late stage cancer...cause you are ""too young"" to have cancer. 

For example, it's been alarming gastroenterologists the number of young people presenting with stage 3/4 colon cancer. They don't know what to do because screening guidelines say that preventative screenings aren't required until your over 50. 

Most physicians aren't screening for cancer in millenials or younger because history has said not needed till older. So you have to be essentially screaming in pain for a while to get screened. Know a few millenials one had stage 4 breast cancer and one with stage 4 colon cancer, probably could have been caught sooner if the doctors had listened at any point during the 5+ years of complaints.

"As a child, I would always hug my grandma as she smelled incredible.  I was around 4 when I found her “gardenia dusting powder” in her bathroom.  Now I obviously couldn’t read this.  But I knew the smell of her hugs.  So I took off my clothes and dumped all her remaining powder on her cold pink and black tiled bathroom floor and rolled in it.   To me, gardenias are the scent of unconditional love.  

My grandma died fairly young of pancreatic cancer.   Was it the dusting powder?  I will never know.  She once came to me in a dream and hugged me for what felt like was eternity.  And I said, “grandma I thought you died.”  And she responded that I needed to wake up. Her actual voice said, “You need to wake up now.”

Your note reminded me of the irony that the entire antiperspirant industry for armpits was created by advertising execs. People literally didn't believe sweat was a problem. And sometimes I wonder if they were right, although I do still use it myself as a habit.

Young realized that improving sales wasn’t a simple matter of making potential customers aware that a remedy for perspiration existed. It was about convincing two-thirds of the target population that sweating was a serious embarrassment.

"Well oddly I agree with basically everything you said.

I guess the rub is that when you started practicing medicine I was in elementary school or junior high.  I've been board certified for just 5 years.

So I actually harbor quite a bit of resentment for doctors who practiced in the 80s and allowed the guise of HMOs/etc to start running us in to the ground.  We let the government pass regulation that PROHIBITS physicians from owning hospitals.  And ever since then the business people have owned them and absolutely destroyed healthcare.

The absurdity is that this was done to prevent doctors from having a 'conflict of interest'.  Meanwhile in the legal profession it is ILLEGAL for anyone other than a lawyer to own a law firm.... Because that is seen as too much of a conflict of interest.  So the lawyers ethical duty to their clients is upheld as protecting clients but the ethical duty we physicians hold to our patients is dog shit?

Now who is left to protect them?  The MBA hospital administrators?  Obviously to anyone in healthcare that is laughable.

Many chinks in the armor like those eroded physician control a long time before I even had an M.D. behind my name.

I'm an Ophthalmologist as is probably obvious by the username.  As far as attracting talent to our field: We make about as much as an internal medicine doctor unless we own our own businesses and surgery centers, which I do or else I may have quit and gone back to engineering already.  In the 1980s Ophthalmologists were just looting Medicare because the reimbursement for your typical cataract surgery was still at pre-phaco levels.  They screwed us all over and are now happily retired and complaining that my generation is lazy.  Assholes.

Technology changed and shifted the field and they still billed like it was an inpatient procedure.  Now I'm paid $450 for a surgery that takes a lot of skill to do well and for the 90 days of postoperative care afterwards.  In the 1980s that paid $2000.  Not adjusted for inflation, raw 1980s $2000.

I could make more money selling ray ban frame glasses and seeing young healthy patients in 15 minute time slots than I do operating now.   Cataract surgery may look easy when you watch a video of someone who has done thousands but as anyone who does it will tell you; it's not just easy. I'm inside of a human eye with a 3mm working space. How much longer is that stress going to be worth it for anyone?

Even the coveted specialties like mine are going by the wayside as the system implodes, exacerbated by private equity and hospital systems buying up practices and deflating physician incomes.  I still am able to do some free surgery when patients need thankfully but I am in a higher volume profitable practice which is sadly rare now.

So I guess what I should have asked you is this:  I'm in my mid 30s.  What the hell are doctors like ME gonna be able to do to change any of this?  Because I don't see anything that I could do that would change any of this mess my generation of physicians has been handed.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ5WUpFdUJTSTBNSXZWVG51RHRaRzVIQ0JJRWxrZGFwX3NxR253VDlRU2dwZkZQUFUxUU9ycGM3bUNqZVZERzc5b0J4VTgxaTU0Y1ZyM21kYm9uV05FVXc9PQ==

"Currently, you as an individual can’t make any macro changes on some sort of national scale.  (Without Herculean commitments and major individual sacrifices.) The system is too corrupt.  Too many firewalls have been removed.  All you can do is remain committed to excellence and treat people with dignity and respect within your sphere of influence.  Continue to exercise good judgement. Actively support good medical leaders in your neck of the woods and at the regional and national level.  Bad leadership (or less than optimal leadership) is the number 1 cause of bad policy.  And we’ve had a string of very bad and mediocre leaders across multiple domains for decades.  We must support the very best leaders.

We might have been able to reliably peer into the future 20-30 years ago.  Now, truth changes every day.  I’m inspired by doctors like Zubin Damania, Jay Bhattacharya, Vinay Prasad.  I would also throw Vivek Ramaswamy in there.  Although he is not a physician he intimately understands medical leadership and the healthcare system.  (I’m not sure why they happen to all be Indian.)

"Just to support your point: 


COVID was long thought to be an oncogenic virus. No surprises when it manifests in reality. 

**Deciphering the Relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Cancer** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10178366/
""In particular, while DNA viruses (such as HPV, HBV, EBV, and MCPyV) encode virus oncogenes, and RNA viruses (like HCV, HTLV-1) encode oncogenes or trigger host oncogenes through cis-/-trans activation, the role of SARS-CoV-2 as oncovirus seems to occur through the inhibition of oncosuppressors as testified by a growing body of evidence that allows speculating about this hypothesis, even though some studies have led to controversial conclusions. The oncogenic potential for the COVID-19-causing β-coronavirus could be explicated by inhibiting the tumor suppressors pRB and p53 through the activities and interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome.""

**Possible cancer-causing capacity of COVID-19: Is SARS-CoV-2 an oncogenic agent?**
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10202899/
""The long-term impact of COVID-19 on morbidity and mortality cannot be neglected. Experimental studies show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to induce re-infection/reactivation and persistent infection in the same manner as seen with other viral infections. One of the most worrying long-term effects of infection is the potential to induce malignant neoplasms, which will be a major health concern over the coming decades. SARS-CoV-2 infection affects many mechanisms that play a crucial role in cancer onset and progression including cell cycle regulation, the RAAS system and inflammation/proliferation signaling pathways.""

**SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential risk factor for the development of cancer**
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2023.1260776/full
""Both the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its aftermath pose extreme challenges to health systems. Recent studies suggest pathogenetic mechanisms common for both SARS-CoV-2 and oncogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 exploits host immunity stimulates signalling and oncogenic pathways and may establish an oncogenic microenvironment. Persons with clinically recovered COVID-19 show profound immune alterations that persist for several months after hospital discharge.""

**The Oncogenic Potential of SARS-CoV-2**
https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/44118 
""Finally, an alarming situation characterizes COVID-19 patients that do not recover in little time but show sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections lasting for months, a condition named as long COVID-19. It has been proposed that long COVID-19 can predispose recovered patients to develop cancer and accelerate cancer progression. This hypothesis has been structured on the mounting evidence of the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to regulate oncogenic pathways, promoting chronic low-grade inflammation and causing tissue damage [81]. Thus, the effects of long COVID-19 on cancer susceptibility need a more profound investigation. In contrast, long-term inhibition of p53 and pRB could be interpreted as an essential risk factor for carcinogenesis.""

"At least you're not really ingesting a lot of that. My worry is more along the lines of single use plastic water bottles, food wrappers, food containers, stuff like that. I think plasma donation is an incredibly under utilized tool when it comes to removing these things from your body. 

It's already been proven to be an effective method to remove PFAS.

https://www.aabb.org/news-resources/news/article/2022/04/26/regular-blood-or-plasma-donation-may-reduce-pfas-levels-in-blood-serum

This trial involving plasma exchange for Alzheimer's patients goes into some detail about the mechanism.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10087461/

>Importantly, lipid apheresis (e.g., plasma exchange) is an effective method to directly eliminate persistent organic pollutants from blood as a result of the binding of POPs to various lipoproteins. 

They've tried it with PCBs with some success.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436695/

>In phase I, both procedures yielded a reduction in PCB levels by approximately 50% after a single apheresis, yet the PCB levels quickly returned. Phase II also demonstrated significant reduction in the PCB levels during each apheresis treatment, which was followed by an increase in the PCB levels until the next round of apheresis. Although PCB levels in blood showed a decreasing pattern within the 12 apheresis treatments, the levels increased after treatment cessation.

>Rebounding persistent organic pollutants in blood following apheresis is the result of a shift of POPs from adipose tissue to circulation as there is a steady‐state equilibrium of POPs between adipose tissue and serum. 

Long story short, donate plasma. Help yourself and others.

Edit- more reading on the relationship between persistent organic pollutants and their storage in body tissues and plasma:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5798659/

Edit 2- I looked up the plasma protein binding affinity of micro and nano plastics for the hell of it. They do seem to bind somewhat, maybe implying they also leave during plasma exchange. It's probably a lot more complicated than the other chemicals I've talked about because of the variability in size amongst nanoplastics.

"No. It says the blue light in LEDs is known to suppress Melatonine production and melatonine is known to suppress cancer development.

The increase in blue light used outside for street lanterns might be responsible. Blue light from smartphone and tablet screens has not been researched but it is a possibility. Why?

The type of cancer is hormone based and that's somehow related to melatonine regulation. It's an increase in a specific type of cancer, not cancer in general.

"Here's a preview of the story: 

Officials in two of the three states probing their first cases of bird flu in dairy cattle this month said their hands are tied after the Food and Drug Administration pleaded with states to ramp up testing and restrictions on potentially infectious raw milk being sold to consumers within their borders.

Wyoming, Iowa and Minnesota announced their first detections of the virus in recent days, becoming the first new states to be added to the USDA's list of cases in weeks. 

""There are no plans to conduct surveillance of raw milk for H5N1 and there are no plans for restrictions on raw milk sales due to the outbreak,"" Derek Grant, a spokesperson for the Wyoming Department of Agriculture, said to CBS News in a statement.

Wyoming and Iowa both have laws that significantly limit state oversight of products like raw milk to ""informed end consumers"" in the state.

I agree with you that obesity likely explains a good portion of these findings. But as someone who was diagnosed with cancer at 42 and who has never been overweight, it is important not to get too smug.  I thought I was the picture of health.  Good diet. Physically active. Healthy BMI. But I had 15 cancerous tumors in my breast, with no outward signs.  It is easy to think that as long as you do X,Y, and Z, you will be safe. But that wasn't true for me.  

So go get your screenings.  If you can swing it financially, pay out of pocket if you have to.  I wasn't due for my first mammogram for another three years but at my GP's suggestion I got one anyway.

Example - if you're in your twenties you probably won't be getting a colonoscopy unless your family history indicates it might be advised. Mammograms also have age brackets. But they will do routine blood work every year. This is because there are statistics that they go by, and insurance is not going to cover a test that isn't needed yet. In other words, you aren't going to be sent for an MRI or CT scan just because you want to check for any conceivable disease on the planet. You have to have symptoms.

Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.""

"By Pandora Dewan:

The secret to healthy aging could be bacteria. Specifically, the trillions of bacteria that live in our gut.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide and increases in incidence as we age. Typically, age-associated cardiovascular disease results from multiple morbidities, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. And while our genetics and a healthy, active lifestyle play an important role in modulating these risk factors, new research suggests another key factor may be at play: the gut microbiome.

For at least 10 years, it’s been demonstrated that statins have virtually no effect on mortality. Sure, they lower cholesterol. But they make virtually no difference whatsoever in outcomes.

Depression and memory decline are intimately linked, with new research suggesting that each might affect the other.

Nearly 1 in 5 American adults aged 65 and over experience depressive symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, some 2 in 3 Americans aged 70 and over experience some form of cognitive impairment.

"**On Wednesday, the World Health Organization's Europe office published a report denouncing the way in which the tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed food and fossil fuel industries are obstructing health policies.**

Each day, 7,400 people die in the World Health Organization's (WHO) European region – a territory made up of 53 countries, with the notable inclusion of Russia – as a result of strategies pursued by the tobacco, ultra-processed food, fossil fuel and alcohol industries. According to the estimate, these powerful industries are directly or indirectly responsible for a total of 2.7 million deaths a year, with tobacco leading the way with over 1 million deaths, followed by ozone and fine particle pollution (close to 580,000 deaths); alcohol (close to 430,000 deaths); and the excessive consumption of salt, processed meat, sweetened drinks and saturated fatty acids (close to 400,000 deaths).

Why compare such far-flung sectors with one another? On Wednesday, June 12, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) published a report based on 35 case studies showing how companies in these industrial sectors use almost identical practices to shape entire systems (health, political, economic and media) to their own interests. This has a direct impact on the increase in non-communicable diseases – essentially, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory illnesses, which are responsible for 90% of deaths in Europe.

This report, with its highly charged tone, is intended as a concrete plea to European MPs and decision-makers [newly elected during the June 9 race](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/10/european-election-results-a-more-conservative-parliament-under-pressure-from-far-right_6674360_4.html). ""We allow these industries to profit from the deaths they cause and behave in ways that delay or hinder effective regulation of their products,"" said Hans Kluge, WHO/Europe regional director.

"FYI careenagen and a number of other natural materials added to foods to improve texture were recently implicated in the development of type 2 diabetes. Yes, scientists accounted for sugar and carbohydrates. 

The emulsifiers you should consider avoiding are carrageenans, xantham gum, gum arabic, sodium citrate, carrageenans gum, tripotassium phosphate, acetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides of fatty acids. 

I found these ingredients in the “healthy” vegan creamer I’ve been using for the past year, in gum, in a low sugar cake mix and more. I’ve been eating tons of this stuff thinking I was buying healthier organic foods.

"in general the FDA is more lax, some substances are less strictly regulated in the US than other places. Some things are straight up banned in the EU like TiO2, others come with a warning. Some states in the US also implement the warnings but they don't help much. And yes you could use very low volumes of a substance but you can never be sure the consumer will only eat the recommended serving size or not buy other products with the same ingredient thus compounding the effect. 

There is a responsibility to protect people from such things especially when there are a million different ingredients in a product. Most people can't even be bothered to check the nutritional facts, let alone the ingredient list and googling every single one to know which is harmful in excess. The problem is unregulated free market practices and the free for all, every man for himself-attitude. TiO2 in milk or cheese for example is just ""people will buy my product instead of the competition's because it looks whiter, cleaner and they'll assume it's healthier and safer"" meanwhile it provides 0 benefit and is also harmful.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) headquarters in Baltimore has closed its doors after legionella, a bacteria with potentially fatal consequences, was found in the building's water supply.

According to CDC data, there has been a rise in Legionnaire's disease reports since 2000. In 2021, there was an outbreak of flu-like symptoms, including fever, muscle fatigue, nausea and respiratory problems at Duke University after approximately 84 individuals were exposed to legionella while attending the K Academy—a basketball camp for adults. Last August, the Southern Nevada Health District investigated Caesars Palace and The Orleans after guests had been infected with legionella bacteria.

Researchers at Japan's Osaka University published a new study examining the relationship between germ cells, aging, and sex, finding that vitamin D extended fishes' lifespan, a result that is likely to translate to other vertebrates including humans.

Dr. Tohru Ishitani, a researcher on the study of Nothobranchius furzeri (also known as killifish), told Newsweek in an email that the study found, ""Treatment with vitamin D extended the lifespan in both sexes in the turquoise killifish, N. furzeri."" The study, published in Science Advances on June 12, concluded that the ""average lifespan was extended by 7% in females and 21% in males, respectively.""

"High up in the hills of Barcelona, brain science start-up Neuroelectrics is developing therapies that it says will improve the lives of people living with brain disease. 

The group manufactures around 400 devices, which it ships to 75 different countries worldwide each year.

Its main product is [a headcap](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/06/13/inside-neuroelectrics-the-brain-science-start-up-hoping-to-curb-epilepsy-and-depression.html), which monitors the brain’s electrical activity and stimulates regions of the brain with mild electrical currents.

Co-founder and CEO Ana Maiques believes it will significantly improve the lives of people suffering with epilepsy.

“In the world, there are 60 million patients suffering from epilepsy and one third of those don’t respond to medication,” Maiques told [CNBC Tech: The Edge](https://www.cnbc.com/the-edge/) in an interview.

“These patients usually go into surgery, either a craniotomy — we remove the part of the brain that is creating the seizures — or an implanted device. So Neuroelectrics is bringing this noninvasive solution to try to reduce seizures.”

In a 17-patient study approved by [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000889), the technology demonstrated a median seizure reduction of 41%. Neuroelectrics is pursuing FDA approval by September 2025.

In addition to epilepsy, Maiques and her team are optimistic that the headgear can also be used to treat depression and Alzheimer’s.

“Our devices read the electrical activity of the brain, but also inject electricity. So, the areas that we’re focused on are those that are clearly electric. So, when you have epilepsy, you have an electrical discharge in one area of your brain, so they can really target and help them,” said Roser Sanchez-Todo, R&D director for Neuroelectrics’ brain modelling department.

"both too little and too much vitamin D are likely problematic, and there may be long-term health effects of ""too much"" that are much subtler than the acute toxicity that can happen at extremely high doses

for example, a long-term excess of vitamin D may promote vascular calcification which is associated with heart and kidney disease: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3120050/

https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/27/5/1704/1844110 

https://cardiab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12933-016-0432-3

i'm not sure if an optimum long-term dose has been dialed in yet, and it probably varies among individuals. but after developing some soft-tissue calcification issues in certain joints in recent years, i've reduced my vitamin D supplementation out of caution. (i used to take 2000 IU daily for years. now i've dropped back to the RDA and added low-dose vitamin K2, which *may* help make sure that the enhanced calcium absorption from vitamin D intake ends up in the bones rather than in soft tissues. research in this area is still young though so at some point we're all flying blind here)",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2ejFzdXp6cGdlRlJ3OFo3dUlSZUNoYk5JRWxNM1JRQUxxWTNZVm1UaWdMSjE5bmo5Ynl6OWJOR3N3SVV2M2dXSFN6RXBQVFpxVWlfVVNBNHJDN2x1TjViTmNVR3FDczZEQVM5bFhaMGFMOW89

"From reporter Alex Tin: 

A ""small but detectable quantity"" of infectious H5N1 bird flu virus was able to survive a common approach to pasteurizing milk, according to new research co-authored by scientists at the National Institutes of Health. 

The findings, published Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, were based on experiments run at the agency's lab. The researchers note this is not the same as finding infectious H5N1 virus in milk from grocery stores. 

So far, officials have not detected infectious virus in any supermarket milk samples.

"Obesity drugs keep getting linked to health benefits beyond weight loss, Yasmin Tayag writes—and it’s maddeningly difficult to figure out what’s causing them. [https://theatln.tc/Ju5LaFUT](https://theatln.tc/Ju5LaFUT) 

The semaglutide Wegovy, the version of Ozempic that’s for obesity, has been approved by the FDA “as a way to reduce the risk of major cardiac events, including stroke, heart attack, and death, in certain patients,” Tayag writes. The latest obesity drugs, known as GLP-1s, have “also shown clear benefits for sleep apnea, kidney disease, liver disease—and can potentially help with fertility issues, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, colorectal cancer, alcohol overuse, and even nail-biting.” 

But GLP-1s can’t take all the credit. According to Randy Seeley, an obesity researcher at the University of Michigan, “obesity is linked to so many ailments that losing huge amounts of weight from these drugs is destined to have ‘a pretty dominant effect’ on health outcomes.” People with obesity are at much higher risk for heart attacks, so of course obesity drugs would help prevent them. “But weight loss alone isn’t always the only explanation,” Tayag writes. “A major trial tracking the heart health of people on semaglutide suggested that patients can have cardiovascular improvements even if they don’t lose much weight.”

“This happens every time we discover a new molecule,” Seeley explains. A drug proves to be amazingly effective against the condition it’s designed to treat, and as more people use it, new benefits can sometimes come to light. “Then, the comedown,” Tayag continues. “The studies, when completed, show that it can treat some conditions but not others.”

“A fuller picture of the potential of GLP-1s may begin to emerge soon,” Tayag writes. “Eventually, studies may reveal how they work—for these and all the other ancillary benefits.” Such discoveries will open the drugs up to new subsets of people, and add pressure on insurance providers and Medicare to cover them. “It would be a small miracle if all of their additional effects, whether separate from or downstream of weight loss, are what help obesity drugs become as widely available as so many other life-changing treatments,” Tayag writes.

"I don't think that's the actual reason in medical policies. They generally only cover a limited set of genes, often just cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy and fragile X, unless there is a family history or ""high-risk ethnicity"" (some diseases are more common in particular populations), or the patient is currently pregnant. X-linked diseases are the other (much stronger) medical reason for testing mothers before fathers, since testing the male cannot tell you the risk that a male child will inherit a copy of a deleterious variant on the X chromosome. It's been a while since I worked in the industry, but as I recall insurers would generally default to denying most expanded carrier testing claims because the test was ""not medically necessary"" (as insurers are wont to do), then appealing was much less likely to be successful for males. 

(That said, from a medical perspective, I don't think it's much of a stretch that adultery ever takes place. That's also why doctors routinely recommend STI tests for people in ""monogamous"" relationships.)

Pragmatically, carrier screening tests are ordered by gynecologists and OBs, and there's not an equivalent set of doctors who routinely see males for reproductive health. So it's very infrequent that males will be tested outside of ethnicity-specific charities, screening of sperm donors (where insurance does not apply), or in response to a positive test from the mother.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3MlZxUkVzREUzcmNNQlZqRTl2QVgyeWNhNUNWcjRLYXQyX3R3TnUzSTY5dEZINWIzNkh5MGpRdC1sN0J2MzdXNnFxWXBmejR0b1plOWJhYmVtXzRvRF9zY2RsV2hVOXdjdWJRVVFVdU5pbkU9

It is a causative agent in morbidity in everyone who has it. 

You are right about one thing. There is no educating you. You have your mind made up which is the opposite of learning.

"[A rare flu variant](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/14/health/dual-mutant-drug-resistant-flu-variant/index.html) that has shown some resistance to the most commonly used antiviral treatment has been detected in at least two people in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Influenza viruses are constantly changing, but this variant has two concerning mutations in places that could lower the effectiveness of treatment with oseltamivir phosphate, known by the brand name Tamiflu.

“There’s active global surveillance going on looking for these mutations,” said Dr. Andy Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “We want to know when they come up, because that could really have major implications for how we treat influenza.”

For now, though, experts say the threat is low.

Cases of the “dual mutant” influenza variant were identified in 15 countries across five continents, including two cases in the US, according to a [report](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/7/24-0480_article) published Wednesday in the CDC’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. But they’re very infrequent, representing only about 1% of the samples collected between May 2023 and February 2024.

“They appear in a lot of places, but they’re never really the dominant virus in any place they appear,” Pekosz said.

“It’s not like the mutation occurred someplace, and suddenly that particular virus began spreading and out-competing everything in one big wave,” he said. Instead, the same mutations seem to be developing in multiple places independently.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bDYzblpwQVhXaFN1QjJOTG5xYUp2WGxxM2NTODBFTUs0bVhRN2hzaGpTbW5pcHNRT01ESXJreU1BRVUwblRXVnROeGpSUzNlLWNMRnNxQ1BZZTZIWEE9PQ==

"You also can really only test for X-linked disorders in women.   If the father had an X-linked disorder he would be very obviously symptomatic, possible unable to procreate, or may not have survived in utero or to adulthood.  Men have XY, so if you have a borked up X chromosome, it's going to affect you. 

Women have XX, so we can be affected and either have a milder symptomatic version that may not be caught (true of some bleeding disorders, you want to know that before you give birth anyway bc that is a risk for the mother even though she has a second, functional X) or we can be carriers.

"I take 8000 IU/day. A lot is still unknown about vitamin D, but it's implausible that a dose lower than 5000 IU/day is healthy. The natural dose is of the order of 10,000 IU/day, but this can be a bit less or more depending on your physiology. The equilibrium amount of vitamin D in your skin due to sun exposure is about 25,000 IU. This amount is achieved quite fast when you have full body UV exposure. At this level vitamin D synthesis and destruction due to UV irradiation will be in equilibrium. 

It takes about 2.5 days for the 25,000 IU in the skin to be transported to the liver and converted to calcidiol. This then leads to the effective dose of 10,000 IU/day. And this 10,000 IU/day is then quite a stable dose. If you go outside and fully expose your skin every other day, you'll still get that 10,000 IU/day, because during two consecutive days 20,000 IU will be transported away from your skin, leaving 5000 IU there. When you then go into the Sun that 5000 IU will be topped up back to 25,000 IU. So, 10,000 U/day is a normal dose that we would get quite reliably when living in Nature. 

Another way to determine the natural dose for adults is via the fact is that babies need at least 400 U. I say at least because if I think the official advice for adults is wrong then it could also be wrong for babies and they would need more for optimal health. Babies drink about 1 liter of breastmilk a day, so you should expect that there should be at least 400 IU of vitamin D per liter of breastmilk. However, breastmilk is almost devoid of vitamin D, therefore we give babies 400 IU/day of vitamin D supplements. 

This is a very strange situation, it suggests that our biology is fundamentally flawed, and we need to fix it by giving babies vitamin D supplements. However, it has been shown that breastmilk does contain enough vitamin D for the baby [if the mother gets about 6400 IU/day of vitamin D](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26416936/):

>Abstract

>Objective: Compare effectiveness of maternal vitamin D3 supplementation with 6400 IU per day alone to maternal and infant supplementation with 400 IU per day.

>Methods: Exclusively lactating women living in Charleston, SC, or Rochester, NY, at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were randomized to either 400, 2400, or 6400 IU vitamin D3/day for 6 months. Breastfeeding infants in 400 IU group received oral 400 IU vitamin D3/day; infants in 2400 and 6400 IU groups received 0 IU/day (placebo). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) <50 nmol/L. 2400 IU group ended in 2009 as greater infant deficiency occurred. Maternal serum vitamin D, 25(OH)D, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations and urinary calcium/creatinine ratios were measured at baseline then monthly, and infant blood parameters were measured at baseline and months 4 and 7.

>Results: Of the 334 mother-infant pairs in 400 IU and 6400 IU groups at enrollment, 216 (64.7%) were still breastfeeding at visit 1; 148 (44.3%) continued full breastfeeding to 4 months and 95 (28.4%) to 7 months. Vitamin D deficiency in breastfeeding infants was greatly affected by race. Compared with 400 IU vitamin D3 per day, 6400 IU/day safely and significantly increased maternal vitamin D and 25(OH)D from baseline (P < .0001). Compared with breastfeeding infant 25(OH)D in the 400 IU group receiving supplement, infants in the 6400 IU group whose mothers only received supplement did not differ.

>Conclusions: Maternal vitamin D supplementation with 6400 IU/day safely supplies breast milk with adequate vitamin D to satisfy her nursing infant's requirement and offers an alternate strategy to direct infant supplementation.

>

So, 2400 IU/day doesn't do the job, but 6400 IU/day is enough. So, from a purely biological plausibility perspective, we should all supplement well above the RDA, and make sure we're getting between 5000 IU/day and 10,000 IU/day. 

The RDA in contrast, is based om the idea that vitamin D should act as a medicine against specific illnesses, and this should be apparent in double blind tests. So, we single out a specific disease, say heart disease and test if vitamin D supplements at some specific dose can prevent it. If not, then we say that vitamin D at such and such dose is ineffective against heart disease. And because we haven't found convincing evidence that t works for any disease other than osteoporosis and we've not ruled put adversarial effects in tests above 4000 IU/day, we put the maximum safe dose at 4000 IU/day and stick with 800 IU/day for prevention of osteoporosis.

I don't believe that this logic used to determine the RDA makes any sense. You basically assume a null hypothesis that vitamin D is totally useless and want that null hypothesis to be overruled by data. This amounts to assuming that Nature got it wrong, that the natural 10,000 u/day may be unhealthy and then sticking with much lower dosages that then cause too little vitamin D in breastmilk, necessitating babies to get vitamin D supplements. 

It's far more reasonable to take the null hypothesis to be that taking between 5000 IU/day and 10,000 IU/day is the optimal dose and then test if it is safe to get less than that.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI3bVh5aWp3d0YxZlBFbEswWFBlWXRTRS12TTdKQVFPN0I3NzhzcEFIUG9TcTBmbGZESjBLSlJvYUdod1kyREV2VDVzeVJwM0NMYkZZX3ZtU3BxeTBxQXc9PQ==

"I'm not a kid, but I've been going through some similar things since I first got it. I've always been a long distance runner. I was steadily improving until my first time catching COVID. The symptoms of COVID for me weren't even that bad because I was in great shape. I felt like I had the never ending cold that wouldn't go away for a month. After having COVID the first time my heart rate was spiking to max on every run and causing me to get dizzy and stop. This lasted for about 3 months then gradually went away. I fortunately didn't have the brain fog. Then I got COVID a second time a year later. Same symptoms just a bad cold that lasted almost a month. This time it was followed by brain fog, intense fatigue and also serious issues sleeping. I would be so tired that I couldn't focus, but I would also lay awake at night unable to sleep without sleeping pills. I have a sleep tracking watch that claimed I was getting less than a half hour of REM sleep per night. I probably went two years without sleeping over 6 hours in a night.

That whole time I kept up my running at about 2,000 miles per year even though I started getting slower and slower and gradually it turned into a run-walk. Even at that high mileage I haven't run a personal best in a race since the first time I had covid. I keep getting slower every year while pushing myself to keep working out through it.

My last time having covid was over a year ago now and I still can't sleep right and I'm still tired all of the time with brain fog. I'm still running and working out every day but I'm slower than I was last year.

I believe you have ME/CFS as a result of your Covid infections: dizziness, fatigue, inability to exercise, sleep disturbance, waking feeling unrefreshed are all classic symptoms. 

It can and will get worse if you keep pushing yourself physically.

"2 bouts of COVID in I thought, ""I don't understand how this could last more than infection"", but now with round 3 this summer of 2024, the extreme symptoms railed hard and left, but the fatigue and stomach discomfort continue...

Before infection my spouse and I were cranking up our steps from 10k, to 12k, and were hoping to hit 15k if we could, and on a regular weights and Pilates schedule, and I can't imagine not getting back to normal. It sounds like hell on Earth to live with this for months, or years.

To others that think this is just out-of-shaped-ness or sloven living, that may be the case in some cases, but I don't have these kinds of reinfection problems with the Flu or common cold. Heck the only Flu I had in the past decade or so was an accidental double dose of vaccine by one of those 'vaccination drives' they run at my workplace each season.

"It’s great that this is being acknowledged. What’s not great is the article conveniently fails to mention that Covid itself can weaken the immune system making people more susceptible to other illnesses. Instead, they propagate the “immunity debt” BS which has been debunked. “Lockdown” was over 4 years ago and they are still gonna keep falling to that? Let’s just tell the whole story and stop with the disinformation. It’s extremely damaging and frustrating to see. It is NOT beneficial to let kids/people get sick to make them “stronger.” This is like letting kids run free in a biohazard lab. This notion has become confused and conflated with the idea that it’s healthy for kids to play outside in the dirt, have pets, etc in order to be exposed to the natural environment and microbes.

"Unlike influenza, Covid is a novel virus. So while we may get knocked down by a new mutation of the flu, our immune systems are fairly well adapted to it. A big enough mutation, on the other hand, can become a pandemic, kill a bunch of people, and leave survivors with life changing sequelae. The “Spanish” flu epidemic in 1919-1920 was one such, and encephalitis lethargica put many people in long term care, sometimes for decades.

Because Covid is entirely new to us, and we are vulnerable to being infected by it, we become infected more easily, pass it on more easily, the symptoms are worse, it does more damage during the infection, kills more people, and we take longer to longer to clear it from our bodies.

I’ve been infected four times. The first time was while the government was telling us that there was no community spread, and my symptoms were GI, not respiratory and neuro. Once I got over it, I was fine. The last time, it was respiratory. That was over a year ago, and I’m still having problems with energy and brain fog.

The good news is that we have had novel corona viruses before. Looks like one of the flu epidemics in the late 1800s was actually a corona virus. While those who suffered lingering symptoms were stuck with them, no one was complaining about new infections after 20 years. That means the virus and us reached an equilibrium. The virus adapted to us by becoming less virulent, and our immune system adapted to it so that we weren’t left with lingering symptoms and dysfunction. The other good news was that our medical community began investigating claims of long Covid in much less time than previous speculative illnesses, and their research is opening up huge new areas of knowledge about the immune system which will eventually pay off for many, many illnesses, not just Covid.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4ajBpUzFCU1ZpY3pTVUlfYXltdHJ4RVAxSmRYc0RQWlRBZ05MWkVGcjNuZ0Z3eWxmeF9EWVhKZDJTWmhKczlreDVFM09COUNZYnd6T2VXcXYxbTg3ZVE9PQ==

"Trump started this mess, and Biden did a fantastic job with the initial rollouts. But putting all his eggs in one basket with the whole “vax and relax” completely failed because Covid mutated too quickly for us to get ahead of it. Dropping mask mandates on at least public transport and hospitals was stupid af.  The fucking CDC is making policy based on economics and not the science we have. They stopped counting and reporting cases. They are recommending outdated stuff and not promoting masking. They avoid discussing it at all costs. Hell, they made a post on X the other day with a photoshopped mask on a person with the wrong label and it’s upside down. When the emergency was declared over, people took that is “COVID is over,” and it’s far from it. No more free tests, vaccines, no more funding. I never hear them say much about it at all. So no, as absolutely horrific as Trump was, Biden admin isn’t continuing to acknowledge or do much at all. Why aren’t they funding clean indoor air and filtering? Why isn’t there clear, up to date messaging? Why aren’t they talking about it at all? So yes, I think they are avoiding discussing it until the election is over. It could be worse, but I’m not impressed. The problem is that most people don’t have half a brain or they are willfully ignoring it. Gov, medical pros, and the population at large on both sides.

"Alright, let's break it down. Cancer's got a new target - the young guns. And it ain't no sudoku puzzle that's got them confused.

While older folks are getting a break with decreasing cancer deaths, younger adults are catching the cheesy end of the stick. And the numbers are chilling - a 1% to 2% annual rise in overall cancer incidence between 1995 and 2020. 😨

But here's the catch - we don't know why. Researchers are still scratching their heads like confused puppies. But guess what? Family history can be a clue to the mystery. 

If you've got a family history of cancer, you're more likely to get it yourself, regardless of age. So, for young folks who haven't reached their routine screening ages, family history can be a red flag. 

And here's where it gets emotional - early-onset cancer can mess with your head like a drama queen. It can mess with your sex life, your body image, and leave you fearing a comeback even after treatment. 

There's no surefire way to avoid this beast, but there's support out there. So if you're young and feeling scared or confused, chin up. There's a crew of doctors and researchers who are in your corner, ready to fight with you. 💪",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4b1RCY1ktRnZ3VXRyckZFM2dnaHhQNjNDeHgzT3A0VURfaDZmaERMR2I2cUVXODk2eDFna1Q3bmZ2WkJKNl9yTEtRRnBwQUstV01XeEhaOG9INldycmc9PQ==
"Hey there, sugar scrubs! 👋 

Did you know that the popular low-calorie sweetener, xylitol, might be hiding a dark side? 🤔

A new study by Clevland Clinic suggests this harmless substitute for sugar could be silently sending your heart and brain on a wild ride. 

The lowdown: researchers tracked the effects of xylitol lozenges on 691 adults over 3 years. While it slightly reduced tooth decay (yay!), it also increased the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes by 11%. 🤯

The twist: this wasn't a small bump - a third of those studied experienced these potentially life-threatening events. 

Well, scientists still aren't 100% sure how xylitol wreaks havoc on your heart, but it's probably related to its effect on gut bacteria and blood sugar levels. 📈

The takeaway?

While xylitol might be tempting with its low calories, it's best to be cautious and limit your intake or choose other sweet options without the potential for a ticking health bomb. ",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4Vk4zc1dCZWtRQUpYX09aYmtRc24zaU9abzJzM1doaUhwdGRuUHhJaTNuRnY2N3d3OEh4REZIUFVTT0JhRkc0RW95VUk2TFVKUm51eUhOQXZLZVhwVXc9PQ==

Now imagine being healthy and vibrant one moment and then suddenly collapsing due to an abnormal heart rhythm. That's what happened to multiple people after consuming energy drinks, some even after just one can! 😨

The study found that energy drinks can significantly raise the risk of cardiac arrest, with some results showing a 50% probability of it happening just from one drink! 😳 That's like playing Russian roulette with your heart every time you reach for that can.

Scary Statistics:

* Overdosing on energy drinks can trigger an acute cardiovascular event, leading to sudden cardiac arrest.
* Many cases of young adults dropping dead after consuming these kind of drinks are being reported.
* Regular energy drink consumption might even secretly increase the risk of heart-related deaths in teens and athletes. 😱",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI4SkFYSjZNczQ3c2JYcTlISlZEcUE3eTRiRTE2c1lBMWxTTVZ6V3hkaXczWnN5TEVIbmJYa0JqRVBVa1REbGtiSElOUEhRa28yU2ItTklwUTBLaUhTUnc9PQ==
"Remember that fluffy, adorable little kid you were, struggling to button those dungarees? 🙈 Well, some of them might be struggling with a different kind of button these days—the kind that's much too tight around their waists. 👗

Childhood obesity has become a global epidemic, and India’'s not exempt. The numbers are downright chilling: 19.7% of our little munchkins are already obese! 😱 

And guess what? That number has been steadily climbing over the last couple of decades.

When did this monster wake up? 

Well, according to the CDC, the alarming trend started sometime in the late 1990s. It's like a spooky time capsule where kids just started packing on the pounds for no apparent reason. 🕵️‍♀️

And the reasons are probably more complex than a potluck mystery dinner. Genetics, environment, eating habits—it's a delicious cocktail of factors, all pointing towards a growing problem.

"Here's a preview of the story:

Tick-borne diseases are on the rise throughout the country — and a unique collaboration between hunters and researchers is helping to bring more information to light.

Hunters are checking the animals they catch for ticks and then sending them to be tested for infections in a program with Baylor University and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. 

""We work with the hunter population because we thought they could be at high risk. And in doing that we realized they were exposed to all kinds of bugs,"" said program director Sarah Gunter, Ph.D. ""We want to know what the risk is in an area because if we're going to diagnose people based off of symptoms, you have to know that there's a risk for that disease in the area.""

A surgeon general’s warning label, which requires congressional action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe,” Murthy said. “Evidence from tobacco studies show that warning labels can increase awareness and change behavior.”

"> We're not experiencing compliments in the same way. Our gender and sexuality combination probably makes the difference. 

Also ethnicity, religion, nationality, and socioeconomic bubbles. For example, the subculture I immigrated from has very little sexual violence due to religious gender roles that kept women at home but also gave them religious-political power as a result. Compliments are also seen culturally as attempts to flatter or manipulate someone, so regardless of orientation or gender it’s considered a bad omen to give to someone in most circumstances unless a lot of trust is first established

No, that really doesn’t apply here. The community religious institutions are primarily led by women, who are the ones who have to carry most rites out and symbolically the husbands must humble themselves before that publicly. 

To give you a Western analogy that fits examples you might already know, no one would say a Pope is powerless before a King in the context of the history of the Catholic Church and European kingdoms. The two hold different institutional powers that keep each other in check by influencing the construction and resolution of conflicting social identities. When the balance favors the Pope, the King acts as a governor for the Pope’s ideology, the ultimate lawmaker but not the ultimate decision-maker. That’s closer to the situation here

> Religious gender roles that keep women at home are inherently forms of control, which falls on the domestic violence wheel. (I'm referring to a literal wheel chart.)

I disagree. That may be the case in Western societies where land is synonymous with private property and wealth, which is the highest socioeconomic value.

That’s not the power structure. Women aren’t at home because men tell women to be at home. Women are at home because that’s where they have power to make decisions that affect the whole family unit. They can freely go where they please. Do you think men go to work because women tell them to be there?

> What culture do you hail from that manages to be free from domestic abuse and manages to have a monolithic of women?

I don’t even know what “a monolithic of women” means, but our community involves a South Asian diaspora that ends in a few places between Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and involves a mix of Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu influences. That’s the best I can do for you without giving you a history lesson on the way different ethnic groups splintered in the **incredibly diverse** environment

You’ve misunderstood the problem with anecdotes. They *are* facts. It *is* valid data. No amount of data will ever “prove” anything in a logical sense.  

Anecdotes just aren’t *inherently generalizable with a high degree of confidence.* That’s different than invalid or non-factual. Research is the process of generalizing anecdotes into useful knowledge

Good thing I did not claim to disprove any such claim. All I said is that a low sample size does not automatically mean evidence is invalid. Observations have value. If those 22 women were well-chosen along relevant factors, we don’t need a specific magic number before the study is useful.

"Lol I still don't get what your point is? Skinnier people have less weight to lose, therefore it's more ""difficult"" i.e it takes longer and more effort to lose the same amount of weight? Ok, and. . .? 

Weight loss and a healthy lifestyle still takes a sustained effort over a long period of time, regardless of what weight you start at. But I can tell you that as someone who has been both a D1 swimmer that weighed 180lbs with like 10% body fat and a middle age dad who peaked at almost 270lbs and 35% body fat, one of those life stages was a lot easier for me to find motivation to exercise and eat right and I bet even you can guess which one.

It's a lot more important for a 400 lb person to lose 200 lbs than it is for a 160 lb person to lose 10 lbs when it comes to overall health. Not to mention the fact that the person who weighs 400lbs later into their life will likely require a significant amount of healthcare, which is covered by insurance/Medicare and raises premiums/depletes Medicare funds for everyone- including healthy people. 

Your mentality regarding overweight people is exactly what needs to change. Are the vast majority of people that are overweight, overweight bc they made consistently bad choices over a long period of time? Yes. But when someone decides to make that change, they don't deserve to suffer and be punished for their past choices. I don't understand why people are so opposed to the idea that someone might potentially have an ""easier"" path to getting fit bc they are taking medication to assist. It's the same with steroids- they're probably going to raise your potential higher than it would be without them but just taking steroids won't make you jacked- you still have to put the work in.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYVTJvMy1kTG1kZnpjc3pIcUllcTNSR2ZJRWJvN1JHM3FBVTJndU5CZjktdUNfSTRBbjRTdXZyMlk5ZWNVdHBMemZlRG1YR0NaNzBmd0Nzd29vczFVNXc9PQ==

If you took 1000mg doses closer than 6 hours apart, I would highly recommend calling poison control and listen to their recommendations.

In the future, you can take 400mg ibuprofen every 6-8 hours in addition to 650mg Tylenol every 6 hours.

"Normally someone your age would be able to follow the adult dosing guidelines, but your body weight is far below average for an adult and is closer in size to that of a child much younger than you. You should follow pediatric guidelines. 

In pediatrics, the dose we use for acetaminophen (which is what we paracetamol in the US) is 15mg/kg of body weight every 4-6 hours and up to five doses per 24 hours. So for you, you would be safe to consume up to 540mg per dose, with a maximum daily dosage of 2700mg or less. 

If you took 3000mg, that’s not too much higher than what you should have taken, but you should call your doctor and get their advice on how to proceed. They may want you to seek medical attention, especially if you’re possibly having symptoms of overdose. At the very least, do not take any more acetaminophen for the next day or so to avoid compounding the problem. You should also not consume any alcohol for the next few days (you actually shouldn’t consume any alcohol in the same 24 hour period as taking acetaminophen, but it’s especially important if you took a little too much). 

If you’re not getting adequate relief from that, what we typically do is alternate it with ibuprofen. So every three hours you take one or the other, being sure that you don’t take the same medication twice in a row. That way you never exceed the maximum daily dose, nor take the same medication more than once every six hours. The dosage we use for ibuprofen is 10mg/kg, which would be 360mg for you.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYWU92OTJkQ2lSajQzUlVBRHNyV1N3a1k0Q1pBNUMzd1hjYk9NVUJ5RW9hMWpaRDNSZ1dKM1RobGh1ekc0VF83NS04ZW5KaE9CNUNsNlJGRlBIdG1iMWlZTjMyV0RwZnZrM3QyRTVLYWxfZ1E9

"You should visit a doctor and possibly a psychologist or therapist. Your weight is too low for your age and height; you should be at least in the 48-52 kg range, on the lower side. This may indicate unmanaged emotional stress or trauma.

"TL;DR:
“there are some measures that tampon users can take to try to reduce their exposure to chemicals in general.

Those include choosing products that don’t contain plastic (including polyester and polypropylene) and avoiding those with fragrances and colorants.

“Something that people who look at this tend to say is that you want to look for period product labels that have fewer and simpler ingredients,” Roberts adds.

DeNicola recommends relying on a combination of “third-party testing and some personal due diligence.” He says there are apps shoppers can use to scan product barcodes and see what chemicals they contain, which could be useful for personal care and feminine hygiene products.

In some cases, people might want to consider alternatives to tampons, such as pads or menstrual cups. ”",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYYk9zQnVOR2NBQTdmaUhmUDNQVDV0dWd1MjFXY0RtVDk4eFNIb0J5U2ZqVEV4cHh4eXY1N2RSR2IxbG9JLWVKYUR4RHZOdmpSNmQxWUcxWm0xazd6V2c9PQ==

There are a bunch of companies blatantly selling 4aco-dmt / aminita currently, including in gas stations and smoke shops all across this country and have been for over a year with 4aco and decades with amanita, and only these diamond shruumz products seem to be causing problems.

Crazy how these grey legal areas tend to be some of the most dangerous when it comes to drugs in general. They also tend to the area that children source most of their drugs because a lot of these smoke shops selling this stuff don’t ID and even if they do, these kids can easily get someone older to buy for them where as sourcing out actual safe mushrooms is probably way outta their reach.

I know I never would’ve smoked synthetic weed in high-school had it not been readily available at every gas station in town.

"Drug addiction/abuse is not the same as having cancer bc eating red dye 40 or some shit lmfao, everyone knows and actively treats drugs like opiates as harmful and that it destroys relationships, I have lived it, I know wat tf im talking about and comparing the bit of puking that excessive marijuana use causes compared to withdrawals from opiates/alcohol is extremely different, u cant compare the two, marijauna is a physiological addiction, much like eating ice cream, its not physcial in any sense, kost that happens is people get a little sick yet they still smoke it and wonder why they are broke and bitch about the government all day with no job or money

Not to mention, ur broke af bc u keep trying to get ur fix and will stop from eating bc u dnt have enuff money for anything but drugs, so u resort to cheaper methods which dont quite scratch that itch which causes u to do dumb shit and ruin relationships, no such thing as a functioning addict and 100% of the time, they need to have support from friends and family but they cant be enabled, they enjoy how they are and they are ok with it 🤷 I never said they were FULLY accountable but its def still their fault

Cancer is an entirely different situation than smoking 

 U can hug a tree and claim to know more than me because u believe urself morally right but in the end, u dont know wat the fuck ur talking about, ""mansplain addiction"" ur the one preaching to me about the shit, I was raised in it, I lived it 🤷 weed isnt a big deal but treating it like an illness when all it is, is simply a bad habit is funny af when compared to hard shit like fentanyl",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZUUpsTG5tc3A5S0N1OTBBTjVoMlNjOWdZcXpZZDBfQzgtalZwUDZnUW45VXpUaTV4YXFFakpDVFNaZUI1c0RfSENza0ZhcExqVElkQkJVc2s3UmRnNWc9PQ==

"The entire peer review and publication process needs to be revamped and brought into the modern age. The constraints that made sense when we printed physical documents shouldn't still be dictating practices today. 

Papers should be well written, but an arbitrary word count should never force unclear writing. The primary form of a paper should be digital to allow use of the advantages of digital documents.

Papers should be living documents. Easily fixable errors should not be permanent scars in important works. 

Likewise, major errors should be addressed more thoroughly than a statement of retraction. Retracted papers don't get erased from memory. The living document itself should be changed to correct or to highlight the problems in ways that can't be missed.

Peer review should be an ongoing process that has pre-publication and post-publication stages. Think of all the post-publication peer review that occurs in journal clubs and online forums. That should be harnessed to make the living documents better.

Journals should still play a major role in this process. Someone still needs to effectively own the living documents, to be responsible for maintaining the servers that house them, to make those uncomfortable changes when major problems are discovered, and to make sure the documents stay living and don't get abandoned.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZV0pZUDNmRjljUUU3XzduZkloVWZmY3d3SVV4OWV1UFd5cUVabWNlX3c1aS13UDNoRmFKRFdzV29JUkc3aWdnT1BFMjgtdlNjN205VDRhQTNDQjhsMGc9PQ==

">The female body uses estrogens (sex hormones) to preserve bone mass, but when this hormone is depleted due to menopause or anti-hormonal therapies, bone tissue degrades: bones become more porous and fragile, less resilient to trauma and break more easily. This happens whenever estrogen falls, except in one context: breastfeeding.
>
>In this case, there is a drop in the female sex hormones, but, surprisingly, estrogen and bone health no longer seem to be connected, the study explains. Despite the drop in levels of estradiol (a type of estrogen) and the increase in bone remodeling — the process of bone restructuring, which is constantly removing old tissue and forming new — to meet the calcium demand of babies during breastfeeding, the mother’s bone mass is largely maintained. Although it is not impossible, osteoporosis or fractures are rare. But it was not known why.
>
>The new study published in Nature is one step forward in the University of California researchers’ efforts to resolve this mystery, says Holly Ingraham, lead author and professor of Molecular Cellular Pharmacology at the University of California in San Francisco. In genetically modified mice that had an estrogen receptor located in a cluster of neurons in the hypothalamus removed, the researchers found that in females, but not males, huge increases in bone mass occurred.
>
>“In follow-up studies over the next five years, we discovered that this bone phenotype occurred due to a circulating factor [vectors of communication between cells and tissues in the body]. Finally, we narrowed down the potential factors to CCN3. This hormone comes from the brain and looks like a growth factor. It is capable of forming strong bones and repairing fractures. We then showed that it is significant in control females [and not only in mutants] during lactation,” says the researcher in an email response.

These are some pretty interesting findings. Hopefully the research that is underway now to find therapeutic potentials in these findings is successful and that we will have better treatments for bone loss in the near future.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZYV9jY1pZZkFPZjN3dEYzS1hGT3J0dk43ZlJSeGFQT1JsTDZJc3BVVUhOcHhVcmdMeGhJSXFiZEMwMjNRZ090U2V1OUNkdGY4OGh0WTVaQnI1SEVveUE9PQ==

“How Much Water to Drink
1. It is advised that males consume 13 cups, or around 3 liters, of daily water consumption.
2. It’s advised that women consume nine cups, or a little more than two liters, of water per day.
3. Ten glasses of water should be consumed daily by pregnant women and twelve cups by nursing mothers.
4. 6 to 8 glasses of water should be consumed daily to provide hydration for children and teenagers.

"Inside a sprawling $43 million Veterans Affairs facility equipped with operating rooms, intensive care units and an outpatient clinic, there are no patients. At least not any real ones. 

The 53,000-square-foot building sits minutes away from the Orlando International Airport in Florida, and it’s called the National Center for Simulation Validation, Evaluation and Testing, or SimVET. It serves as the primary hub where teams of front-line health-care workers from the VA travel to practice procedures and pilot new technologies, all without posing unnecessary risks to patients.

For instance, if a team of clinicians wants to adjust their response to opioid overdoses or test out a new artificial intelligence tool, they can repeatedly simulate the process at SimVET. VA officials told CNBC that by practicing in a controlled environment, health-care workers can iron out problems and ensure that new ideas are feasible and safe to implement. 

SimVET, which opened in 2016, serves as an example of how simulation within health care has become [increasingly common](https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primer/simulation-training#:~:text=In%20recent%20years%2C%20the%20use,in%20a%20variety%20of%20settings.) and more sophisticated in recent years. As health systems are looking to evaluate hundreds of new AI tools that have recently arrived on the market, facilities like SimVET can help cut through the noise.

"I have one friend that was part of vaccine trial in the end of the 80s. The vaccine was never released on the market after the trial, but sadly it caused many people to get life long health issues. My childhood friend ended up with MS, and her doctors believe its due to the vaccine. (I got the same vaccine too, but luckily I was not one of the people being affected). 

Then we were offered the Swine flu vaccine around 2009-2010. My mum (who is a nurse) had talked to some of the doctors at the hospital where she worked, who said they were sceptical of giving the vaccine to infants. I had an infant at the time, and decided to decline the offer to get the vaccine. One side effect of the vaccine was people developing narcolepsy, which will affect them for the rest of their lives. 

And then there is the different side effects from the Corona vaccine, I personally know two people who got badly affected by those (both ended up with heart-related problems).

"Here is what chatGPT has to say about Tianeptine:

Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant primarily used in some countries for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It has a unique pharmacological profile and is distinct from more common antidepressants like SSRIs and SNRIs. Here’s a detailed overview based on various aspects:

### Efficacy

1. **Antidepressant Effects**: Tianeptine is effective in treating major depressive disorder. It has been shown to have comparable efficacy to other antidepressants such as SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants.
2. **Anxiety and Stress**: It also has anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties and is sometimes used off-label for anxiety disorders. 
3. **Cognitive Function**: Some studies suggest that tianeptine may have pro-cognitive effects, potentially improving cognitive function in patients with depression.

### Safety

1. **Side Effects**: Tianeptine generally has a favorable side effect profile compared to other antidepressants. Common side effects include nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, and dry mouth. It tends to have fewer sexual side effects and weight gain issues.
2. **Addiction Potential**: There are concerns about the potential for abuse and addiction. Tianeptine can produce opioid-like effects at high doses, leading to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms.
3. **Overdose**: High doses of tianeptine can be dangerous, leading to respiratory depression, liver damage, and other serious health issues. There have been reports of overdoses, especially among individuals using it recreationally.

### Experience

1. **Onset of Action**: Tianeptine has a relatively rapid onset of action, with some patients experiencing improvements within the first week of treatment.
2. **Dosage and Administration**: It is usually taken orally, typically in doses of 12.5 mg three times a day. The dosing regimen may vary based on individual patient needs and the treating physician’s recommendations.
3. **Patient Experience**: Many patients report good tolerability and a positive impact on mood and anxiety. The lack of significant weight gain and sexual dysfunction is often highlighted as a benefit.

### Pharmacological Profile

1. **Mechanism of Action**: Tianeptine has a unique mechanism of action. It modulates the glutamatergic system and enhances the reuptake of serotonin, which is contrary to the action of SSRIs. It also has an impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is involved in the stress response.
2. **Opioid Receptor Activity**: Recent research has shown that tianeptine acts as a full agonist at the mu-opioid receptor, which likely contributes to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects as well as its potential for abuse.

### Regulatory Status

1. **Availability**: Tianeptine is approved for use in some countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. It is not approved by the FDA for use in the United States, where it is sold as a dietary supplement in some cases, though this is legally ambiguous and potentially unsafe.
2. **Control Measures**: Due to its potential for abuse, some countries have implemented restrictions or controlled substance regulations for tianeptine.

### Clinical Studies

1. **Comparative Studies**: Various clinical trials have compared tianeptine to other antidepressants, often showing similar efficacy but with a different side effect profile.
2. **Long-Term Use**: Studies on long-term use are limited, but it is generally considered safe for extended use under medical supervision.

### Conclusion

Tianeptine is a unique antidepressant with a distinct pharmacological profile, showing efficacy in treating depression and anxiety with a relatively favorable side effect profile. However, its potential for abuse and dependence, especially at higher doses, necessitates careful monitoring and regulation. As with any medication, it should only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional.",r/health,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhUmFqWW00NG84MTRCbmdQaW4xd2JtaGxPOGlpYWxpNEhuUUFZZ2dFUUFscUdaZGRaUFhzbFF1ZWtITnl3OWhZRTlTSTM0Z0U4Vmw0WVpqN09IUGdPWlFKcjNsUUY0NlVDV203VThqQ0RyV2c9
