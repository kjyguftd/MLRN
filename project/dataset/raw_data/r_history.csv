"*It was the fall of 1967, and the new town of Reston was on the brink.*

*Its too-modern townhouses weren’t selling. Its development was lagging. And its founder, Robert E. Simon Jr., was running dry on cash faster than investors — who for years were skeptical of his master-planned, European-inspired, racially integrated community — were infusing it.*

*The proposal “was so unusual for Northern Virginia at that time,” said Shelley Mastran, a board member at the Reston Museum. “A lot of lenders just looked at this architecture, townhouses in the middle of nowhere, and said, ‘This is not a solid investment.’”*

*But Simon’s unlikeliest partner risked it. Gulf Oil already had rescued Reston once and now, in September 1967, gave it a final financial lifeline. This one would end with Simon exiled back in New York, abruptly booted from his own project.*

*It also would end, to the surprise of national observers and the town’s first residents alike, with two of the world’s largest oil and gas companies building Reston into just about what Simon had envisioned.*

*“It was Gulf and Mobil that basically made Reston Reston,” said Chuck Veatch, an early salesman under Simon who has worked in Reston real estate ever since. “First Gulf and then Mobil basically stuck with the master plan for the development of Reston, and they had the money to do it. They had the money to pull it off.”*

*Simon had had money, too. It just couldn’t meet all that radical Reston, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this weekend, turned out to cost.*

I will never understand the obsession with looking for 100% historical accuracy in movies or TV series. They are made mainly to make a profit by entertaining people.

"If the director wants it to be. But this film wasn't. Historians have determined that gladiators had a heavy layer of fat, for example, which protected them from slashing wounds cutting into muscle tissue thus making fighting difficult or impossible. They certainly didn't look cut as Crowe's character or many of the looks of other gladiators.

I could rattle off many discrepancies in the first film (but I won't), which I did enjoy very much, and I bought the DVD when people still used them as I viewed it as entertainment. So I don't want to crap on the film as I enjoyed it as a film, entertainment, not a factual historical re-enactment (Crowe's character didn't even exist nor did the story arc of the film).

I believe it is similar to food. Some people think there is only one proper way to make a dish (I was trained as a chef but I don't feel this way). Some love fusion. Some take a recipe and play around with it (me). Ultimately, as long as the person a service or product is made for enjoys it, that's a good thing and I'm not the arbiter of what is good or bad, we each are for ourselves.

"Can anyone explain the following in more plain language? It seems like it may be relating to causes of the black plague of the 1300's but I'm not sure:

>Yersinia pestis, the infectious agent of plague, split from its most recent ancestor Yersinia pseudotuberculosis some time within the past 50,000 years and has been infecting humans since prehistoric times. The vast majority of prehistoric plague genomes are from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age (LNBA) individuals dating to 4700–2400 cal. BP (refs. 7,8,9). These genomes fall within two distinct lineages that can be distinguished by the absence (LNBA−) or presence (LNBA+) of the ymt gene8. The ymt gene is crucial for the bacterium’s survival in the flea digestive tract when the source is an infected mouse, black rat or human, and hence for the development of bubonic plague. Until recently, all known prehistoric plague strains fell within these two LNBA clades; however, findings published in Rascovan et al.4 and Susat et al.10 demonstrated the presence of earlier diverging Y. pestis lineages (pre-LNBA). These two ancestral Y. pestis genomes were identified from a Swedish individual with Neolithic Farmer (that is, Anatolian-derived) ancestry (5035–4856 cal. BP)4 and an individual from Latvia with hunter-gatherer ancestry (5300–5050 cal. BP)10, respectively. Although these genomes are of very similar age and ancestral to all other plague genomes available, the two studies arrive at different conclusions: Rascovan et al. argue that their finding supports a role of plague in the Neolithic decline whereas Susat et al. conclude that these early plague forms are probably a result of sporadic zoonotic events.

"It looks like it is theorized that LNBA- could have resulted in zoonotic infections, while LNBA+ was necessary for the transmission of bubonic plague, but the two studies mentioned are not in agreement about this.  One group thinks the Neolithic decline was through zoonosis, the other thinks it was from plague.  What I find interesting is this:  isn't plague zoonotic?  Black plague was transmitted to humans from infected fleas on the backs of vermin, so isn't this zoonotic?

"I have started making timelines when I get freetime. It is fun, it helps visually to better remember how exactly events and situations where close to each other and affected each other in the process of decision makings by people.

So far I've only made the timeline for history of Iran from present and made it as far as early 1400s for so. I do intend to go as far back as possible.

I understand there is so much you can put into a 2 dimensional line before it turns into a undecipherable mash of info no one would like to look at. So I think geographically I'll only extend it to the brims of Iranian plateau maximally and the states around the Persian gulf. Maybe.

There is a trade off between going macro geographically or micro in timescale, I don't know how to balance the trade off.

So far all the categories I've included have been dynasties, kings/presidents, wars, treaty, And ""event"" this last one is anything that I don't know what to name like ""the first modern school"" ""king of Georgia defects to Russian empire"" ""first constitution"" etc.

It is pretty shallow in terms of info, but I am not sure of it will be a good a idea to add other information. Maybe adding some famous writers/politicians/philosophers? But that also feel like a Pandora box once you write this one person, why no that other person?

"Frankly, I think that this is a route that many amateur historians and people who end up being historians eventually go down, but most realise what you're starting to (i.e. that it is not that useful). There's really only so much you can fit on a timeline. And once you know these things, these timelines aren't much of a use to you. As a professional historian I rarely have to think about or mention specific dates, it's more of just an understanding. 

That said, if you are interested in doing this. The best way -- in my mind -- would be to split it up thematically. Have multiple layers of the same period of time. 

So 1600-1700 CE politics, 1600-1700 CE economics, 1600-1700 CE science, 1600-1700 CE social politics, 1600-1700 CE inventions, etc. etc. If you have multiple timelines of the same period you can space them out a bit more and still read them together. 

I've quickly stolen this picture, but imagine instead of Project A, B, C etc. it's each of those topics, in the same time period, but with different areas of focus.

This document aimed to limit the power of the monarchy and establish certain legal protections for the barons and other high-ranking members of English society. The Magna Carta is often regarded as a foundational document for modern democracy and the rule of law. It introduced concepts such as habeas corpus and the right to a fair trial, influencing the development of constitutional law in England and beyond

"Hi readers, recently I've read a book ,""The Wise King"" Simon R. Doubleday,that needs more recognition. It's a biography on Alfonso X of Castile "" The Wise"", and I really enjoyed reading it. It's well written and makes you learn various aspects that were not previously taught in school. It's interesting how the author decides to focus on aspects like ""Father"" ""Anger"" ""Friends"" of this crucial figure during the historical background of a Spain that was also Muslim.

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Simple/Short/Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

"I know a lot of people associate this event to have happened on July 20th, 1969, but hear me out, this is incorrect (or is it). While it is true that man landed on the Moon on July 20th, 1969, at 20:17 UTC (1:17pm PT, 3:17pm CT, 4:17pm EST). Neil Armstrong didn't take his first step until 6 hours and 39 minutes after they had landed, with Buzz Aldrin joining 19 minutes later. Thus putting the official time when Neil took his first step at 02:56 UTC on July 21st, 1969. 

However, I understand the confusion. If they landed at 20:17 UTC on July 20th which = 1:17pm PT on July 20th, 1969, and Neil took his 1st step 6 hours later, that would make it 7:17pm PT on July 20th, 1969, and therefore according to us that is the correct day. The problem here, is that they are not using the same time that we are, they only have one time, which is UTC.

It's universal time, which means, that's what time it is no matter where you are on earth, or in space, at least according to them. Which I find weird, because time shouldn't even exist in space, but that's another topic, lol.

Here's an example. As I'm writing this it's 5:01pm PT, July 21st, 2024. But in Brussels, Belgium, it's 2:02am July 22nd, 2024. Maybe time travel does exist, lol.

All jokes aside, I think that when it comes to dealing with space events, we have to use the UTC clock, because that's the only thing they go by, they are always ahead of us. Maybe we should just convert all time zones to UTC, I'm sure that's coming one day.

However, what do you think is the correct time? What time and date, correction, calendar, should we officially go by?

"I lack of knowledge about any good manual specifically about social history, but I have some suggestions. A good gateway point would be the school of les annales, if I am not mistaken they were maybe the most influential in giving history it's directions towards a social approach - marxism and Toqueville had their share too. I would expecially recommend the work of Bloch on feudalism, which is amazingly written (I read the italian translation). Le Goff (there is a collection of essays on the mind of the medieval man curated by him), Carveri also comes to mind, relating to mannerism and etiquette in Frech society. On a more contemporary period, I wuold suggest Habermas work on the public sphere (not an history book, but very influential and maybe the closest to what you are looking for), maybe also Mosse works on the cultural developement of nazism. It's all up to which period you are most intersted in. A good way to start is women history, Weisner-Hanks did a good job with her manual and it has a very good bibliography you can look up (you can find it online).

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer.

- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)

"It's really not. It's called iconography. Roman iconography is pretty well studied, and I promise you that the person running the study knows it better than you do. You not only have to think about what it looks like, but why it would be there. You also have to think about what it is presenting, there are multiple clues that all point towards Minerva. 

If I drew a little circle with an arm extended above it, and two dots for eyes and a small mustache you would know who it was and wouldn't go ""it could be anyone with a small mustache hailing a cab"" 

We get a lot of signs through iconography as to who is being represented. For example, if we see someone wearing a lion skin it's typically Hercules/Herakles, or Alexander the Great (or one of his diadochoi imitating him). There's a rare chance that it could be Milo of Croton, but even if you found it in Croton I would still take the safe bet of Hercules unless his name was literally carved in it. 

 There are clues that can help us separate Hercules from Alexander. Facial here is a quick one to look for, but is not always definitive as Hercules can sometimes be shown as clean shaven too. The weapon he has is usually a huge indicator (Hercules usually has a club), and Alexander usually has armour, or is otherwise dressed, while Hercules is usually nude or scantily clad. 

With Minerva there's a chance to confuse her with Athena, so we have to take in things like where it came from, when it was made, etc. to help distinguish.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRKT3RoRjJMemlzQlN6M1lsOGxpSXBNbWc3bzV5SEpmMTRfTUdFSVlUUmJ3M3JMQ2syZUU4Sjk2NnJ6b0VYUVVYdDFzblRtd0oyUU1rRnNWT3BrVVdUUkE9PQ==
"It's bronze not silver or gold so monetary value is probably less than $300 even if the engraving is unique/noteworthy. Having a unique/identifiable engraving probably makes it more interesting for a museum but doesn't raise the value much as Roman bronze rings aren't particularly rare. 

Also, from what I understand, all archaeological finds in Israel legally belong to the government, so technically speaking he isn't owed anything just for finding it. There are people who disagree strongly with these types of rules but I imagine the sheer density of artefacts and important sites in the Levant, the government doesn't want to incentivise amateurs trying to find things just to turn a profit.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRKdVEyeGlQLUpIQ29Ga1loN1FDclkzdlMxVHJoeFhhS3VLblhuTXhScjJmMXdhT1hjTndXSklqSXktTGpjNFpXb2lfSm1MbTlWUXYyWEVaVXhHU19aU3c9PQ==
"You're welcome, yeah the person who carved the image didn't do a wonderful job, they even struggled with making a straight line for the spear. I'm going to guess that it's not the same person who made the ring, but you never know. 

The comparison link doesn't work? Google ""Capitoline museum Minerva"" (note: she's missing her spear but you can see where it would have gone) though doing so I now see the Museum is saying it's a bit older now. But basically most statues of Minerva will show similar traits, even more modern ones which reflect the Roman iconography.

"Yes, and no. 

It's the equivalent, and they have a lot of the same mythology, origin, skills, etc. but they are coming through two different cultural lenses. And also we have a lot of things happen with mythology where gods/goddesses/demigods can blend together and join characteristics in one culture's system, but a similar one in another might keep them separate. Also, you would add different variations of the same deity within that culture, or as time goes on they change, so Minerva in one century might be different from Minerva in another, or Minerva in one place might be different from Minerva in another, so those both will be different from Athena in Athens, even if sometimes only subtlety. So, for simplicities' sake we can say ""it's Athena in Rome"", and if you're not dealing with mythology as part of your studies that's perfectly fine to keep it at that, but it is a bit more complicated than that if you really are digging deep.

Also we see a bit of cross cultural exchange where they can sometimes get attributes from different cultures that are added to theirs. They didn't copy and paste Minerva from the Greeks (Minerva was Etruscan as well) but some of the mythology associated with Athena did become associated with Minerva through this joined association.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRLX1hwMi1yVkp3YTRTNUV3TGdXSm1aYWxtYVl3dHlFOEZNOWhxd3dXcmo0aVJFNWhkSV92bGZRaEZwLV82SW5wbmVzdE8zMmozTVJJYXYzYmJMZDBSblE9PQ==

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Simple/Short/Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

"Mars can often be lacking a shield, but this isn't always the case. But a shield is usually more associated with Minerva, while the spear and helmet is associated with both. He sometimes holds a trophy (dedicated after a battle to claim victory, though both sides could do so), or a cup. The next thing to look for is a beard, though Mars can sometimes be shown as younger, especially in older works. https://www.forumancientcoins.com/moonmoth/coins/pics/sep_sev/sep_sev_015.jpg 

The use, or grip, of the spear is one of the distinguishing features though. Mars usually has it pointed outward, as if ready to use it, or he has a high grip, with the blade pointed down into the ground. https://www.forumancientcoins.com/moonmoth/coins/pics/geta/geta_004.jpg 

I don't think I know of any ancient depictions before the 3rd century CE that show Minerva ready to use her spear (she would use a thunderbolt as a weapon instead, though I have seen coins describe the bolt as a spear, which I believe is wrong). The grip can sometimes be high, like with Mars, but can also be lower (as shown on this ring), a bit more relaxed. 

So look for the shield, or lack thereof, look for the beard, or lack thereof, look for how the spear is used, and held, and in more detailed images we would look at clothing, and other associated imagery (the thunderbolt, etc.) 

Then you look at popularity, and the representation. Minerva, as part of the Capitoline Triad, was far more important than Mars (outside of Gaul), and was worshipped more widely and in more representations.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRMUU5aRjdMMnRNNDMwbUZ0dUxxRVYtNGJRLU9tVVJ6dFdUQk9jRkFnN19LZFB3TXdfZTJVRVRqcDJ3T2dsUTBhaDlHdEZJMFVKZVFxVHdSYmZjdHJ3SlE9PQ==

Possibly because America's expansionism seemed like a pretty big war goal for them on declaring war, when they would ultimately end up failing in their invasion of Canada and would end up fending off an invasion of their own nation.

"There is a fundamental difference between Britain stopping the practice of impressment and Britain stopping the practice of impressment against American merchant ships.  It’s irrelevant whether the British used impressment elsewhere after 1815, because they stopped using it against US merchant shipping.

The outcome of the war was literally the end of all of those things.  This idea that the U.S. didn’t win because they what..didn’t conquer Britain?  Is ridiculous.

"I guess you can say that yes.

English unification was built on the desire for Angle and Saxon hegemony. That was in demand because of incursions from Vikings making it increasingly difficult for smaller petty kingdoms to exist. A strong unified kingdom was basically the solution to Viking raids long term.

So I guess yes, in a way the Island and the defence of it was the reason for the Anglo-Saxon union.

And for why it was called East Anglia, there were various places the Angles settled that didn't necessarily translate into Angle kingdoms.

Most Angles that migrated north, west, and south were minorities in kingdoms that were Saxon first and foremost. Over time, Angles would achieve parity more or less.

So it was called the kingdom of East Anglia because from their point of view, Angles lived to the north, west, and south, they just didn't have their own kingdoms.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGROQi1iRER5ZWtMZi1vWV82RUthNXBGbUZHdm5pUDk5YjUzcGRvLWlPTlprQUJJbElTalkwZWhjNENWd2p6TWpkTk1JNjBkM2I1QkZoc1VaMTNzYmc3dUE9PQ==

"It's both.

In general, it's not helpful to say ""an undefined number of people from this vague region, but sometimes not, who mostly descend from this vague group of people, although also have a thoroughly culturally mixed minority group, migrated from one borderless location, to another"". You have to balance the messy reality of history vs communicating history in a helpful way.

When you say Anglo-Saxon, you narrow it down to a broad distinction. Of course it's not perfect, but otherwise it would be impossible to talk about anything. You have to draw a distinction somewhere. And when talking about the Anglo-Saxon migration, this was a migration event of peoples that spoke languages and dialects in that linguistic group.

When I refer to Anglo-Saxon here, I'm talking about Angles, and Saxons, migrating. They would *become* Anglo-Saxons by virtue of this migration. Basically, it's just ease of communication.

"I am trying to understand how nobility worked logistically in Elizabethan/Jacobean Britain.  Specifically, to what extent being created a noble was still associated with real property vs in a feudal system like in the medieval period ( such as right after the conquest in 1066).  If George Villiers is made the Duke of Buckingham, how much real estate/land etc was associated with that?  Does he suddenly have a Duchy?  If so, how does that change things for the lands suddenly under his name?  Do they start sending taxes or payments of some kind to him?  I was hoping there might be some references someone could recommend that explains some of this, since it seems really complex and to have changed a lot over time.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRWNEI1SWxDWlI1cUZtYW02dElpeTZjWWZfX3NvUFEtV2hQLTRzTW51YTNWTzBLemF5NnkxdGN2N2R6NEhBeEgwcXJoQWh6Qll5aWFBU1JKcXZuWW1TQ2t3ZmFzTnN4NGRLaHpDRHA1Y2JpbDQ9

"Not at all.  Where on earth did you read that?  Canada's first significant step towards independence was in 1848 when the Canadian parliament's non-confidence vote in the government resulted in its resignation.  This established once and for all that the government answered to the Canadian parliament and not to British politicians in London.  Later, in 1867 the two provinces of Canada were joined by two more provinces to form the new Confederation of Canada.

All this came after the sacking of Washington by the British army.  No Canadians took part in that, although they certainly took part in repelling the US invasion.

">At the age of 13, Joan began to understand her calling: to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and help reclaim French territories from English control.  


Any narrative that calls Charles VII the ""dauphin"" after the death of his father in 1422 is silly history. You can explain why the English crown would call him that, but using this terminology is really a sign of ignorance of the topic at hand


>In medieval Europe, women were largely confined to domestic roles and had limited opportunities for leadership.  


This is even sillier. The extraordinary thing is that a peasant girl would do that. Plenty of women in position of power in medieval history. Hell, the power struggle around Charles VII was marked by his mother Isabeau of Bavaria on one side and his mother in law Yolande of Aragon on the other...

"How Did America Resolve Labor Demands After Slaves Were Emancipated? 

I don’t really remember being taught this in K-12 and even in my college history courses, at least not in detail. I understand there was an adjustment period, where slaves were slowly receiving their freedom after the Civil War, but how did the government manage to make up for that free labor economically? 

Was there a meeting where officials came up with a type of programming to solve that problem? How did America transition from relying on free labor to developing a social hierarchy dependent upon profession and income? I know there were elements of that hierarchy during the slave era, but was the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class as significant as it is now?

These questions lead me to believe that people in power, when faced with this issue, somehow managed to develop the concept of the American Dream—a competitive and seemingly unattainable ideal. This was integrated into the culture to draw people in with the promise of free land and upward mobility. As we know from history, achieving this dream is not as easy as it sounds. Numerous factors and influences create marginalized groups. The reality of this facade is that this core aspect, ingrained into Americans since birth, is genuinely fictionalized. 

We need to change the culture to achieve true equality. What has historically defined “the top” in America? Money, fame, fortune, scholarly achievement, positions of power? Why was that decided for us? Would it be possible to redefine what it means to be an American by reshaping what “being at the top” means and spreading that new definition widely?

Anywho, those are just my thoughts and opinions. I am genuinely interested in knowing specific and accurate details about this era, as questioned in the first paragraph.

Thank you in advance.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYWDVpeW1HQ0hpMUNITTJiSWVvamtzNkY0cUxJNEltclNVVE85WllNbUIwNVlfVURTWWtNTHlmZGs1YV9wMUZHTkMwTW5hMndOVzd6cWNGZmszMjdmODhNUDZYdjBES1JnOTgwUWhFVG8xb3c9
"> These questions lead me to believe that people in power, when faced with this issue, somehow managed to develop the concept of the American Dream

The concept of the American Dream is about 50 years post slavery. You have the Gilded Age in the Reconstruction era, but this was a period of relatively high(er) wages. This came not because slavery ended, but because so much of the labour industry boomed in the period which followed. It wasn't farm labour, but industrial labour that they were after. 

So there's two things to keep in mind. 1) don't think that just because slave owners didn't pay slaves that they lacked the ability to pay slaves. The money was still there with profits for any capable handler. They didn't pay them because they didn't have to. 2) slave labour or unfair labour did not end after the war. 

So there's a few things that happened. Some of them continued to hold slaves and not pay them. There's only so much enforcement that could occur in an area where people were generally okay with slavery occurring. Others kept former slaves, many of whom had no place to go, and paid them basically nothing to keep doing the same job with some added freedoms. 

Others brought in other racial minorities that they could exploit, particularly those from China. We see this most famously in the railroad building and gold rushes, but this also happened in the American south with what we call ""Coolies"" (important note: this term is extremely offensive outside of a historical context). The US Government was aware of Coolies being used, and they had also been used prior to the war, they even tried to ban the practice before the Civil War ended, but again, enforcement is an issue. The laws passed in the coming years would basically allow Coolies to be used as long as they weren't kidnapped and were paid something. But obviously once you take people from China to the American south where they know no one, can't speak the language, and have no means of getting home, it's easy to exploit them. See in particular *Coolies and Cane* by Moon-Ho Jung.  https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/3259/coolies-and-cane",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRYT2drSGttMmxCcS1wc2ZZNFc5c196Snp0empIRWhHR05ieGJCeFN5QzdWS0RWdHlQZG40Uk9WRkpHbERYaldpYkNLTk0wSDVJS1lUMjlSdXgxRjdmX3c9PQ==

"It kind of depends. The problem for historians, as the other poster mentioned, is what survives. Some stuff will be widely used. My local historical society had a project for people to journal their experiences through the pandemic. That will be a useful source. The journals will probably be scanned at some point, and maybe even transcribed. But the archive will also hold the paper journals. 

The other thing that matters is what's the project the historian is studying? Are journals helpful to it? For big things that are national in scope and widely known, they might be helpful. But if they're smaller niche topics, like about something like a firefighting crew working the wildfires in NW New Mexico this summer, my journal as someone several states and environments away won't be useful.

If it's for something like the history of environmental science of some topic, than scientific papers and news articles might be more important.

But it's going to depend on what the historians are studying and what they have available to them.

*How Did America Resolve Labor Demands After Slaves Were Emancipated?*

You've got like 40 topics in this post and all of them are complicated.

Labor demands varied wildly from place to place and most of it was solved through immigration. Whether that was immigration internally from state to state as it was post 1920s or whether that was from foreign immigration, and whether that immigration was voluntary or forced through enslavement changes over time and over location. 

*I don’t really remember being taught this in K-12 and even in my college history courses, at least not in detail. I understand there was an adjustment period, where slaves were slowly receiving their freedom after the Civil War, but how did the government manage to make up for that free labor economically?
*

There generally wasn't a governmental policy on labor demand. The advent of the administrative state and policies around topics of labor supply, wages, economic management, etc. are fairly new. There was the period between 1791 and 1811 and then again between 1816 and 1836 were there was some federal attempt at regulation of the economy, through the 1st and 2nd National Bank, but it was minimal and mostly just addressed monetary policy (very primitively) and government debt. 

Most of what we think of now as economic policy is an invention of the FDR administration and wasn't possible legally until after the famous West Coast Hotel case. This topic involves a combination of complicated state capacity building and the history of the administrative state and a complicated legal history. You'll often hear of the Lochner Era of the court and it's this pre West Coast Hotel era when courts had a very strict interpretation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. 

Most labor regulation was left to the states. In the southern states, former slave holders enacted a series of laws called Black Codes that limited freedom of Black Americans. Ideas about citizenship were still very much in question. States determined citizenship then and most southern states didn't allow for Black Citizenship. That changed in 1868 with the passage of the 14th Amendment, but it was still a fight. Usually, things like labor contracts and debt, forms of social control (enslaved people were often forced to take the last names of their enslavers so everyone would know where they were ""supposed"" to be working), and things like vagrancy laws and prison leasing kept Black people stuck in place and limited their ability to find new jobs. Manisha Sinha's new book, The Rise and Fall of the 2nd Republic gets into this a little, but there are other complex issues like Republican ideas about economic progress in the south that created incentives for large farming concerns and low wage farm labor/share cropping systems that made small hold farming economically unviable. 

*Was there a meeting where officials came up with a type of programming to solve that problem? How did America transition from relying on free labor to developing a social hierarchy dependent upon profession and income? I know there were elements of that hierarchy during the slave era, but was the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class as significant as it is now?*

There weren't officials meeting to come up with solutions to economic problems until FDR's administration because 1) there wasn't an administrative state that could do it and 2) the federal government wasn't legal to really have a national economic policy in the way we think of it today b/c of the court's interpretation of the commerce clause. I don’t know what you mean by free labor exactly, but America was probably more hierarchal pre WWII than it is now. The passage of FLSA and the NLRA were key to workers being able to really advocate for improved conditions. Before that a workers only real option was to leave, and labor stability was a huge issue. 

As to information on the wage gap, it’s also very complicated. 1) We don’t have statistics on national wages that are great before the passage of the 16th amendment. There is some information from the IRS before that but they mostly focused on the extremely wealthy and that was only for a short period around the Civil War b/c of proportional taxation rules in Art. I of the Const. There is some census information, and some states did a good job, but nationally it’s a hodge podge before 1913. 2) Wealth was very different pre-1900. Most people’s wealth was entirely in land, especially after the 15th Amendment and the 2nd largest property class (enslaved people) suddenly didn’t exist. B/c of that wealth inequality seems less b/c enough people owned enough land that they seemed to have similar wealth. But income inequality was wildly different. Most farm laborers made about $10 a month throughout the 19th century, that was a large driver of people quitting farming and getting into wage labor in the growing industrial sector of the economy. Wealth inequality could be huge with a simple mechanic in the city earning 3 or 4 times what a farm laborer was earning, but their wealth might seem similar b/c the farm laborer had land and the mechanic did not. But at the end of the 19th century, with a real uptick during WWI, you get some of the hierarchy you seem to be talking about, but it was just a different hierarchy, and was probably even less hierarchal as wage labor became more important than land holdings.

*These questions lead me to believe that people in power, when faced with this issue, somehow managed to develop the concept of the American Dream—a competitive and seemingly unattainable ideal. This was integrated into the culture to draw people in with the promise of free land and upward mobility. As we know from history, achieving this dream is not as easy as it sounds. Numerous factors and influences create marginalized groups. The reality of this facade is that this core aspect, ingrained into Americans since birth, is genuinely fictionalized.*

The concept of the American Dream is complicated. It’s changed significantly over time from a Jeffersonian idea of the republican yeoman farmer at the end of the 18th century, into an idea of a pioneering westward moving go getter, into an entrepreneur and self made man during the later 19th and early 20th century after the frontier closed, to something more like it is today that began after the end of WWI. Before WWI, the American Dream wasn’t extended to everyone. It wasn’t meant to include non Anglo Americans initially. By the end of the 18th century German immigrants were included in the idea, but not very many other immigrants were. By the time of the 1860s it was expanding to Irish immigrants. By the turn of the century Southern Europeans and Jews were starting to be included and the idea of America as a melting pot was beginning to take shape. Black people were beginning to be included during WWII as part of the Double V campaign. Mexican Americans were able to begin to stake a claim during LBJ’s administration with his Great Society program. Sarah Churchwell had a recent book on the subject in the 19th century called Behold, America. She’s got an essay in the Catalyst that gives a brief overview of the topic: https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/state-of-the-american-dream/churchwell-history-of-the-american-dream",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRZOU9uQXNVN1EzWW5TdEUzSHVGa0lhZHExWnNTUGt1YjdKcy1MUXRLUy03ZlNUd1hxNXVLSHpueU9HNXUxX1ZvdlpmTXk3MkUxS05DUjdKa1RqQ21NT1E9PQ==
"*We need to change the culture to achieve true equality. What has historically defined “the top” in America? Money, fame, fortune, scholarly achievement, positions of power? Why was that decided for us? Would it be possible to redefine what it means to be an American by reshaping what “being at the top” means and spreading that new definition widely?*

The top has been defined differently in different times and places. Part of the fight between Hamilton and Jefferson was this definition. Part of why no one liked Adams was b/c of his more aristocratic definition. Money and power come from different sources at different times. For Jefferson and Washington, it was in vast estates and the people they enslaved. For Hamilton it was a robust commercial sector. For Adams it was a kind of mix of piety, civil duty, and economic comfort. This is very different than what the top was after the US Civil War or during the 1920s when the Jeffersonian ideal became completely eclipsed and the South became the least economically productive area of the country. These hierarchies are always changing. Scholarly achievement was only sort of possible in the 20th century when the US started to develop a respectable university system. Before that, if you wanted to be respected doctor or scientist, you went to Europe, preferably Germany. Lousi Menand’s Metaphysical Club does a good job of looking that change. Right now, in the US there is a fight between what different groups count as the top. There is polarization about the value of expertise, what is a respectable way to earn money, what is an acceptable level of wealth, who should control the political direction of the parties, etc. 

I’d also say that I disagree with the other poster is on wage growth. Wages were higher at the end of the century, if you were a skilled urban worker, they were probably up about 400 to 500%, depending on where you lived. If you were a farm laborer they were probably only up about 50%. But this wasn’t consistent. B/c the was no national bank to regulate debt and currency the US went through a financial “panic” about ever ten years. Wages yo-yoed the entire century and you could very well be earning a lot less in any given year than you were a year or two ago. On top of that there was a lot of inflation. There’s a real argument as to how much real wages increased. A lot of time, even though your wages may have been higher than they were a decade previously, your real wages could be lower. This was especially true for farm laborers, and part of the reason why small scale farming wasn’t really viable in the south.

"Horrible Histories and Egyptian Predictions

I distinctly remember when I was younger, I read a horrible histories book on the Egyptians, and in it it stated that the Egyptians predicted the birth of Jesus, WW2 and the world ending sometime in the late 3rd millennium (I can’t remember the exact year). Thinking back now, I’m surprised something like that would be stated as fact in what’s supposed to be an informational novel for kids. Any idea what it was on about?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRmSzRRWXp0RV9zUkZFMVd4MXhfNlREU09oNDVRSlNYc2pJcDRqenBUS0hvNGhhdk12bGVCdklEcUY0Rm5XX0lLSC1iUUFDZ3R4aWlYZXlhUFFtRHNCNVYxUHptcU52bHBjOXo2b1F0TDZSdUk9

"I am going to take a crack at the dog joke.

 I believe even ancient bars had a countertop or table, and kept the alcohol high up. So naturally if a dog walked into a bar he would not be able to see even above the counter and the high up bottles. Therefore he would only see on the ground. Even in the old west they would keep spit or filth jars on the floor for people to use in the bar. I believe this could have been a tradition far, far back in time as well. I believe the joke is a dog walking into a bar, not being able to see anything high up, and then getting into the filth or spit jars on the floor thinking it's a drink. Just my interpretation.

 I can't imagine it being ""random humor"" as that would mean developing a joke meta to break in the first place.

"  Did the escape from Alcatraz use a raft that included a wooden pallet(s)?

   According to the non-fiction book titled: Escape from Alcatraz, written by J. Campbell Bruce, on pages 214 and 220 it says: Morris said, ""I want to find out more about the beach and Angel Island and the channel between there and Marin. Also a point or two about our route down to the beach. I hear there is a pile of lumber, still on pallets, near the powerhouse. Maybe we can use a few boards to stiffen our rafts."" He debated a moment. ""This is Friday. We go a week from Monday night."" 

  I think that since the escape route was at the shore right next to the powerhouse, that it's logical that they would have planned to build the raft using a empty lumber pallet that was kept outside the power house. The FBI report said that they had access to 50 raincoats to craft the life jackets and raft with and that's surely enough sleeves to sew together for inflatable inserts into a long rectangular type pallet. A pallet raft would have the advantage of keeping them out of the water level and since the water was not too choppy it would have been practical because it would keep them close to the water level where they wouldn't pose such a large silhouette on the waters. And a pallet raft would have been large enough to hold 3-4 persons. And Clarence and John Anglin were from Florida were they would have known all about pallets and rafts and docks made from pallet type wood. A pallet raft would be a no-brainier for them to craft in a jiffy. And a pallet raft would easily float back out to sea on the current after they made it to the shore, leaving no trace behind of their escape route. And any airborne searchers would not take notice of a wooden pallet floating in the ocean because that region is a prime traffic zone for shipping vessels that presumably could easily have lost a pallet of cargo to the waves in a storm. And the power house is easily within view of the workshops where they were gathering the materials for the escape. They would just have to watch and wait for the right day when a empty pallet was left outside the powerhouse to put the plan into action.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRnckFjMTAwemE0ak9UMXE1b2ttb0xva1dtdGR4ZmlyZk1wVnRmSVFjdlgzYmJza2Uya1l2T21EMWlsLXNJazlyLWJ0cXNGdFUtQnZwd0xRdjRQWEpkMmc9PQ==
"Often in movie and time-period works of movies or television, the olden days, especially in medieval eras are portrayed as constantly serious and rarely, if every, laughing. I haven't watch GOT, but I imagine it is routinely somber and serious from what I have seen. People make funny commentary all of the time. People like to laugh cause situations and satire are funny as fuck. What goes through peoples' minds is what creates humor. 

I despise how the Queen or King's court is always serious, serious, serious to the point where everyone involved in the production is always serious. Royals probably larked all of the time.

"Did the escape from Alcatraz use a raft that included a wooden pallet(s)?

According to the non-fiction book titled: Escape from Alcatraz, written by J. Campbell Bruce, on pages 214 and 220 it says: Morris said, ""I want to find out more about the beach and Angel Island and the channel between there and Marin. Also a point or two about our route down to the beach. I hear there is a pile of lumber, still on pallets, near the powerhouse. Maybe we can use a few boards to stiffen our rafts."" He debated a moment. ""This is Friday. We go a week from Monday night.""

I think that since the escape route was at the shore right next to the powerhouse, that it's logical that they would have planned to build the raft using a empty lumber pallet that was kept outside the power house. The FBI report said that they had access to 50 raincoats to craft the life jackets and raft with and that's surely enough sleeves to sew together for inflatable inserts into a long rectangular type pallet. A pallet raft would have the advantage of keeping them out of the water level and since the water was not too choppy it would have been practical because it would keep them close to the water level where they wouldn't pose such a large silhouette on the waters. And a pallet raft would have been large enough to hold 3-4 persons. And Clarence and John Anglin were from Florida were they would have known all about pallets and rafts and docks made from pallet type wood. A pallet raft would be a no-brainier for them to craft in a jiffy. And a pallet raft would easily float back out to sea on the current after they made it to the shore, leaving no trace behind of their escape route. And any airborne searchers would not take notice of a wooden pallet floating in the ocean because that region is a prime traffic zone for shipping vessels that presumably could easily have lost a pallet of cargo to the waves in a storm. And the power house is easily within view of the workshops where they were gathering the materials for the escape.

"Here are some shipwreck silver coins from the famous SS Central America and I wanted to share their history with everyone. These 1853 and 1855 Chilean 50 Centavos are pretty unusual due to the fact historians and marine archaeologists were able to piece together clues to find the original owner.

Pascual Esquerra was a Chilean businessman who was aboard the ship as it sailed its way to New York in 1857. In addition to his chests of silver coins was 30,000 Lbs of gold with a melt value of round $1.1 billion. The SS Central America encountered a hurricane off the coast of South Carolina and eventually sank claiming the live of 425 people including Mr. Esquerra.

"It was age of cultural, economical and scientific degress.

Also, you cannot forget that Middle Ages lasted from 5th to 15th century. You're talking about Universities, but they didn't appear until late 12th century, and most of them are much younger than that.

The fascinating thing about Middle Ages is that we don't really know anything about it's first half, which is sometimes called The Dark Ages, so we tend to forget it even happened, and when we imagine Middle Ages, we imagine the late Gothic Era from the end of it, with knights in plate armor and majestic castles. But that's huge oversimplification of the entire era.

"Depends. In some regions of the Europe, we can say formerly Roman, there are relatively sufficient historical records. In some, nothing. At most scarce reports of traders.

E.g. in central Europe there was a slavic state called *Samo's Empire* in the 7th century. It covered current Czechia, Sorbia and part of Austria, possibly even parts of Slovakia and Slovenia. And realistically the only thing we know about it is that Samo was a trader from Francia and had 37 kids - supposedly. Nothing else. There's almost 200 years of void before the existence of another state in the area, the Great Moravia, was recorded.

>Abstract:
The initial peopling of South America is a topic of intense archaeological debate. Among the most contentious issues remain the nature of the human-megafauna interaction and the possible role of humans, along with climatic change, in the extinction of several megamammal genera at the end of the Pleistocene. In this study, we present the analysis of fossil remains with cutmarks belonging to a specimen of Neosclerocalyptus (Xenarthra, Glyptodontidae), found on the banks of the Reconquista River, northeast of the Pampean region (Argentina), whose AMS 14C dating corresponds to the Last Glacial Maximum (21,090–20,811 cal YBP). Paleoenvironmental reconstructions, stratigraphic descriptions, absolute chronological dating of bone materials, and deposits suggest a relatively rapid burial event of the bone assemblage in a semi-dry climate during a wet season. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the cut marks, reconstruction of butchering sequences, and assessments of the possible agents involved in the observed bone surface modifications indicate anthropic activities. Our results provide new elements for discussing the earliest peopling of southern South America and specifically for the interaction between humans and local megafauna in the Pampean region during the Last Glacial Maximum.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRxOFRuSlUyNzI5a1FyTGNDWUYyWkxpcUZXeV9yVWg4b2t6RW5wN245UnFUMThJMDYtVGoyY0JrRTc1TU80SDVVMUVCRTgyNWRMaDllZzhraUdSdU9OU1E9PQ==

"This is just in terms of the GOP and Dems, and not stuff like the Anti-Federalists/Federalists, Whigs/Dem-Republicans, or any of the No Nothings, free soilers stuff. And this is just on the topic of racial issues, but a lot of other things like labor rights and social welfare issues tie into the shift of urban constituencies.

Basically, the Dem party had a few major constituencies. A big one was southern political power holders, but the other really important one is the urban political party bosses that could turn out large numbers of voters. Tammany Hall is kind of the pre-bollweevil example that most people are familiar with. These urban bosses maintained their political power by turning out large numbers of working class and urban poor to vote. They did this by giving out aid and creating jobs and patronage. A lot of this was very corrupt, but it still generated a lot of economic benefits that the party could control.

In the 1890s the US started getting bollweevil infestations that were destroying cotton crops. It made share cropping, that was already untenable economicallly for the share croppers, impossible. So you start getting a migration from the south to the north of Black Americans. They are shut out of farming b/c they can't afford land so they get jobs in urban settings in factories. A lot of northern businesses actively recruited them as a counterbalance to growing labor power (Henry Ford did a lot of this). But as these people move north they get incorporated into the Democrat's urban political machines. 

It's not a smooth process, you have people like Wilson who fight against it within the party, but by the time you get to FDR, in places like New York, Detroit, Chicago, and Cincinnatti, Black Americans are an important part of the Dem urban coalition. And you see FDR having to thread this line between his southern coalition partners and demands from his northern urban coalition partners. FDR starts making reforms that can do both things. All war housing that's built is segregated, but b/c of the work of A. Philip Randolph and his threat of a march on Washington, FDR issued Exec. Order 8802 which prohibited discrimination in hiring for defense industry jobs. https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-8802

Black Americans also launched the Double V campaign that very much tied the US civil rights movement to the victory in WWII and drew clear comparison to the lack of democracy in the US. This put a lot of pressure on FDR b/c of the obvious hypocrisy of the US position of making ""the world safe for democracy"" when there were frequent racist riots and attacks by white people against Black servicemen and Black workers in the war industry.

FDR institutes programs like the Black Panthers, the Red Tails, and the 92nd Inf. Div. By the time of Truman, you get a reversal of Wilson and a desegregation of the Military and federal government. You still have the feds letting states administer federal programs like the GI bill and the FHA that states run in a racist manner (banks made sure the FHA was administer in a racist manner everywhere in the US up through 1968).

But all these things were creating a conflict in the Dems. In ‘48 you get the split with the Dixiecrats, many like Strom Thurmond who would become Republicans around the time of Goldwater’s ‘64 campaign. 

Throughout this entire time, basically since the late 1890s when enough Black Americans were excluded from democracy in the southern states,  there was a push within the GOP to become more openly a party that catered to white interests. This faction of the GOP was coined the Lily White GOP. You see strong movements in all the southern states to fight what were called the Black and Tan Republicans who wanted a biracial coalition. 

This basically comes to a head in the 1960s with the CRM and the Civil Rights Act. Herbert Humpries gave a speech in support of  LBJ at the 1964 Dem Convention that forced the Dems to choose a side. They chose civil rights. At the same time, the GOP nominated Barry Goldwater. Goldwater pretty openly courted racists with his ""states' rights"" campaign until too many klansman started showing up at his events. At first he tried to play coy. It was very much akin to Donald Trumps initial refusal to reject David Duke's endorsement when Trump claimed he didn't know who he was. Goldwater kind of pretended he didn't know about it. Goldwater campaigned on his opposition to the CRA and to Brown v. Board. Goldwater also violated laws and GOP rules by having primaries held in segregated locations to prevent Black GOP members from participating. The San Francisco GOP convention is famous for it’s open racist hostility to their Black Members. This was the turning point for prominent Black GOP members like Jackie Robinson. Black delegates talked about being spit on and having their feet stomped on. People like Rockefeller and George Romney who spoke about rejecting the Klan and John Birch Society Members were heckled.

In light of what was going on throughout the south at this time, white racial attacks were playing out on TV almost every night b/c Bull Connor had just left office the year before, Goldwater lost. Opposition to school integration was still strong. Places like Prince Edwards County in VA had shut down it’s entire school system instead of integrate and kept it shut down for 5 years, not reopening until 1964. 

The Dems leaned into civil rights after that with LBJ passing 3 major civil rights bills, the ‘65 CRA that outlawed segregation in public accommodations, the VRA, and the ‘68 fair housing act that ended redlining and housing discrimination. Nixon was able to exploit white resentment about this, and you see a lot of experimentation among leaders about how to address this with things like the William F. Buckley campaign for mayor in 1965 and Daley’s response to MLK’s failed Northern campaign in Chicago. Nixon was able to figure out how to rally disaffected white voters on a number of causes, like crime and protesting groups as a whole, this was the height of anti Vietnam war protesting and left wing violence like the SLA and the Weatherman, and the civil rights movement. 

Ken Phillips died last year in the fall and there are a ton of articles looking back at his work and the Southern strategy. They’re good to read through b/c you can see what he actually did and that it wasn’t as effective as he had hoped. Now instead of being a national party, the GOP is somewhat stuck as a regional southern and rural party and tied to white resentment. But whether he was successful or not in his goals, to make a national party with broad appeal to white voters, the strategy did very much create a perception that the GOP is for “old white guys” and the Dems are the party of civil rights.

">Is it serious to claim that Britain was trying to conquer…

I didn’t say conquer, I said invade to force a capitulation. But the British *did* turn occupied Maine into a (short-lived) colony.

>with only 16K men? Britain had deployed 40-50K men to Iberia during its struggle with Napoleon.

You realize this point works against you, right? Fighting in Spain and Portugal was far more important, far more intense, and the British still had almost half that number of troops in the US and Canada.

>If Ukraine throws out Russia, would we call that a defeat because they didn’t also capture Moscow?

If the war ended with Russia still in control of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk, “draw” would be a fair descriptor.

"Invade to force a capitulation = conquest. If an invasion forces a capitulation that is conquest. 

If Ukraine ejects Russia from its territory, then it wins. It doesn’t need to invade Russia to force a capitulation. When Vietnam defeated the US, did they ‘invade to force a capitulation’ did the Taliban when they beat the US?

These are defensive victories. 

Britain had 16K men in entire theatre only in the last six months of the war. It had 30K during the Revolutionary War. How does an 8K raiding force in the Chesapeake constitute an attempt at conquest or your bespoke ‘invasion to force a capitulation’ category? They were simply trying to stop the US attacking the Canadas.

Victory for Britain = the survival of the Canadas. 

Only the US could declare war, invade, fail to conquer and then call it a draw…

A lot of the stuff the populists were pursuing was for the relief of western farmers. The most famous of their policies would be “bimetalism” where they pursued basing American currency off of a gold *and* a silver standard. This would increase the money supply and also lead to inflation as more money poured into the system. Producers such as American farmers supported inflationary politics because it meant they could sell their produce at higher costs and then use that money to pay off their bank loans. Banks were opposed to this because they would lose out on the loan repayments, with inflation causing them to be worth less than they would’ve been when issued. Hence the Bryan v McKinley election was viewed as one of populist “anti-economic” policies vs the party of big business and “prosperity.” There’s other famous populist policies such as direct election of senators, but the money debate is probably the most famous. 

William Jenning Bryan’s legendary “cross of gold” speech was about the gold vs bimetallist currency debate.

La Follette was a bit of a populist in his own right, but he was associated more with the progressives. Progressives were technocrats associated with alleviating the contradictions and oppression of capitalism through government reform. While a populist would turn to the people and rile up the crowd  about how unfair banks are. A progressive would be someone more likely to pull out charts and evidence and describe the exact detailed policy that would “appease” farmers without having to antagonize banks. It’s a rather subtle distinction that I hope I am getting across but it is fascinating imo.

If one wanted to you could draw the comparison between Biden’s presidency as a “progressive” one rather than a “populist” one that people expected out of a Bernie presidency. I would caution against going too far with that analogy since these are two very different political and social contexts, but it may help give you an idea. 

Both the populists and progressives, as the left wings of liberalism, would occasionally have support from socialists and other anti-capitalist movements even if the solutions either group would pursue would have subtle but important differences. To give one last example- a populist would want to improve people’s lives by putting more power and money in the hands of common everyday farmers, while progressives would want to improve people’s lives by reducing tariffs to decrease prices and legislating quality of life improvements such as government sanitation and health programs",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRyT1pkZVl1RFBSd3paZTVEdVJxRXZlQzZpZzB6VGRSLWVTQ18yWXdEZUtFMnpsQWdBTFlSZXVYaVRGQ3NpZExxLVViZS1ibDRrQUktZDJQOEdTVi1pa2c9PQ==

Women often wore males clothing either due to possibility of rape and disadvantaging the man, I believe she felt they were more comfortable. 
However she remained a virgin even to her immolation. I had always felt the English had provided her with only men's clothing, as to break her security.

"Well let me start by putting it this way

It wasn’t that the parties themselves “switched” so much as the populations they represented changed.

The United States doesn’t have real “political parties” as they exist anywhere else in the world. Instead they operate as loose confederations of different state parties that come together and endorse specific candidates. A candidate is not beholden to any sort of actual “party discipline” and thus the parties have only recently become more ideologically driven and a lot of issues we seen in political discourse since the 1990’s is that party leadership is still pulling on these old levers that don’t really do anything anymore.

So to take that apart a bit more if we were to look at say 1920’s-1960’s you would find “conservative” and “progressive” wings in both parties. The labels aren’t exact and should be understand as post-hoc classifications like most historical labels are. I’m going to pause a moment to get into how the two parties should be understood (in order to understand their left and right wings)

The Republicans had their origin in the collapse of the Whigs in the late antebellum period and they arose as a sort of “pro-capital” and “pro-business” party. Ranging from the small scale quasi-Lassallism of Yeoman frontier farmers represented by the likes of Lincoln and the proto-capitalists who would emerge as the great winners of the American Civil War. The progressive wing of the Republicans came more from that Whig-Lincoln tradition that believed more in empowering the individual through access to the land and the government’s task of helping to build a society such men could thrive in. The conservative wing was more overtly capitalist in its interest. You could view Teddy Roosevelt as coming from that progressive “left” wing of the party but William McKinley and Calvin Coolidge came from that conservative “right” wing of the party

Cont.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzNmNWZFBUbUg1eVhpbDctZFhCWXNYWUVrYUd6VkVCUEMzWEVyMUZzRjRrRkNwcFMtUnVQZGVhRDhhZkxkSWhJbDc4SmNxd0JyTHQtR2NGNjdGenFUM3c9PQ==
"The Democrats, however, were older and dated back to the second generation of American political leadership. Chiefly Andrew Jackson and Martin van Buren. They were the party of the “common white man” through the former, with all of the social conservatism and racism that entailed, and the party of the political machine through the latter. That is how Democrats also came to be associated as the party of (white) immigrants since those populations would make up key voting blocs of their political machine.

The progressive movement in both parties arose from the contradictions and horrors of capitalist development in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The arguments used and even the policies pursued would differ between Democrat and Republican progressives, but the basic idea of trying to “improve” the ills of society through technocratic legal management directed by highly educated intellectuals and academics was more or less the common goal. 
 
The conservative Republicans, the more overtly pro-business wing, would have their heyday in the interwar period of the 20’s and 30’s in the presidencies of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (although Hoover is a bit more of an interesting case). They would fall out of favor in the aftermath of the Great Depression and the rise of New Deal politics.

The New Deal coalition brought progressive energies mostly into the Democratic Party under the leadership of the elder progressive FDR. The party machine itself eventually adopted FDR’s progressivism as seen two later political leaders who were “party men”- Harry Truman and LBJ. Versus FDR who was a classical progressive and JFK who was an idealistic rich kid

The conservative Republicans would strike back against the progressives in 1964 and the rise of “movement conservatism” most closely associated with Barry Goldwater. As the Democrats alienated their conservative faction with the civil rights movement of the 1960’s it led to the conservatives coalescing into the Republican Party under Nixon in the 70’s as a reaction to the 60’s, and then more completely under Reagan in the victory of conservative neoliberalism over socialism and Keynesian progressivism in the 1980’s (although to be fair Keynesian economics saw its collapse in the 1970’s under Ford and Carter).",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGRzN2labUtEWFhsNHlzVGgzVzA0UHN0WmI0R2pEWmU3ZmhHM19BaHJBSXBBb09TVk9oWnduaW9OTVg2bE4yZkttTlNlWExsNFZiWmpFWjNFOVNZVjRtSnc9PQ==

"Statements like that ring equally true for much of Antiquity, even during the heyday of the Roman Empire. Singling out *just* the medieval era in that sense always feels a bit disingenuous in that light.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0Z3hMVmdOT2ZmeGQtVEl2c1VOeU5leDk5VTVtSE96YkdPMUFfN2ZSSTNoZnlGdDVKTU1lOXcwcEprajVfMHREdWQ4cC1JaTNKZ0lmOVp6Nl93R3Uyc2c9PQ==
"The problem is, that the eras didn't progress in all areas equally.

E.g. the Antiguity was happening only around the Meditaeran. The regions outside Roman and Greece influence remained in Prehistory.

But the beginning of the Middle Ages is considered universal for whole world - the sacking of Rome 455. And frankly, it doesn't make sense. Different regions of the World progressed into Medieval at different times. Roman regions in 455. Middle East in 622. Etc. And some regions of Europe didn't enter Middle Ages until 13th century.

So a separate term ""Dark Ages"" has some logic to it. I'm not a professional historician, so I don't know if there's such consensus, but I believe it should. Middle Ages for regions, which already progressed into Medieval. Dark Ages for regions, which were still prehistoric/antique, despite the date being after 455.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0VTE5bUU2Wm54R0JIaklZVjVLelRiMXZoOC1fRUJ4b2VCWFpjREJJbU5Kd1FqNzhfQ3hhd0VDaHY0dDFzdG9xaGNsYXVxZXFZdDN6ckZ5VnBSLXhuOEE9PQ==
"But the term medieval - and dark ages within that timeframe - can hardly be said to be universal (or pan-European for that matter) either, no? So I still find the term not that universally applicable, certainly locally in terms of a dearth of sources, like Britain after the Roman withdrawal. Regions like Francia and Italy, however, retained a more continued stream of documentation (if lesser in volume).",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0M3JnWXg3bURSSXBCZ2RjMHVKQnM5Vzh2U1pNMDY0d3A1M3Q1RThTVF9KN3ZDa1ZkT1N5NUZTd0R4X3dnNTAzQi1yMXNxdlZRcmEzM01BNnVSczhqdlE9PQ==
"It's the best we have. It's not perfect, but nobody came up with something better. After antiquity, the progress of Europe was heavily fractured, and describing it with one term is never going to be precise.

Perhaps more precise than term Middle Ages is the separation of eras based on architecture. Roman, Romanesque, Gothic... But there aren't many records of architecture between 5-10th century, so we are back to Dark Ages.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0OWdVNVBCNm5EOHdkQV90ZWtwX1E0MTRWUGpFdzBjdDFqZVNTTGt3ME9rZlZCM0F5YmJET0RLbVh2X0dVaEVMNW9rQXQ3Z0pyYWZ1a3FxdEFmSVdqV2c9PQ==

"In this sense, Joan of Arc is a symbol of rebellion against the general male-oriented norms of society, for which she left a remarkable political impact, still notable in the present. Joan, identified as a warrior of God, was born in 1412 during the Hundred Years’ War and ensured the French army’s significant victories. She is on record for having actually lifted the Siege of Orléans in 1429, which ultimately signified the turning point for the French. Despite the fact that the woman was a military conqueror, she faced a tremendous amount of prejudice solely based on her gender. In 1431, at the age of 19, she was captured and set on fire, succumbing to death. She was tried and martyred for it, an element that pointed to the strict gender norms of the day and the opposition to female power. The Roman Catholic Church canonized her as a saint in the year 1920, indicating that her influence was not only pagan but also persisted in both the Christian church and the realms of the world. The scenario of today’s gender statistics, for instance, the increasing percentage of women, may be attributed to her. This is just a part of a brief summary of Joan.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGR0dlc1RjlOaTd6Skc5NnFtMUYzMDlWclZzRV85MGhYNDRJd3czdWpia295Wk1Pd2JUQWVtaVJxbVRGdDdiZlBBYklBM3BjX1gwRU9ILXcxUGlFQlJabFE9PQ==

"Hi!  
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

"Yep, I understand the frustration.

The reality, luckily, it's pretty different, with historians having developed a sensibility for the life of people that national histories rarely had in the eight hundred.

"Really fun read, I especially liked the bits about Edwards and the co-founding of the E.S.S. 

>The success of Edwards' book led her to co-create the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) in 1882. Inspired by Edwards' goal of exploring to conserve monuments in Egypt, the EES raised money for excavation through subscribers. These subscribers, mostly from the British middle class, received excavation and site reports each year. These reports – containing maps, lists, drawings and new scholarship – have educated and informed the public's view of ancient Egypt for nearly 150 years. 

The Society still exists today, here's a quick bit from their page about their history https://www.ees.ac.uk/our-cause/about-us.html",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ0NXBkeDBlbkpuQXRmMFREcTAtY3NSd2pHN29ia1Fzb0JsYlIxbW9iVVVQbUhNbnJMWl9PdzhBOGFsTWZKeDNNMzloblpYdUxHc3ctbVJyWEcwMWp1M0pxYlRLMFVQQi1sSzlCSkNVdTFfMDQ9

>Abstract:
The identification of ceramic forming techniques poses challenges, particularly when different primary and secondary forming techniques are combined, or when specific surface treatments obscure potential diagnostic features. As emphasized in the existing literature, a comprehensive approach should consider all potential sources of information. In this study, we employed a combination of macroscopic observations and X-ray microCT analysis on experimental cups reproduced using the complex technology attested in Middle Bronze Age Crete, i.e. a combination of hand-building technique and potter's wheel. Our investigation focuses on the potential of microCT scanning in unveiling forming techniques in wheel-thrown and wheel-fashioned ceramics. Our results indicate that integrating the visualization of 3D thickness variation in vessel walls, quantification of 2D wall thickness distribution in longitudinal virtual slices, identification of possible structural joints in virtual sections, and evaluation of voids orientation with traditional macroscopic analysis generally allows for the recognition of primary forming techniques and the reconstruction of complex ceramic technological processes.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ1WF93MVE3dkljVE02SjZ0NVgzVlUtbmxObGlrSEotQUZTWUdDdXhUOFlQZ1NFYlBwYVR0WGdQQ1RWc0t0Z2FoSzU2THItMWtHclJMa3hiNWRhRDdJV1E9PQ==

"Most of the victims being women is not proof that the reason they were accused was because they were women. With that logic the current murder rate in the USA proves that the US is horribly misandrist because 82% of murder victims are male. Clearly it's hatred of men that causes such a pronounced bias.

You need to look at the individual motives to understand the individual motives. While misogyny will certainly have played a part, it cannot be championed as the primary reason without delving into individual cases as personal quarrels, jealousy, social manoeuvring, settling old scores, etc. could all be much greater reasons that a high number of women would accuse other women.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGQ1Y05DUmJqc013YTN5Y0JtQ0IzLTlseGVhaXZJNE5wSGhTNEZSWmdDSXRYbDBTZi13Y0E4V0NsRlJhNUw5bFgxRy11cVY2TE84QkZxWVlZTnVxaWlYWmc9PQ==

"I'm almost done with Frances Clarke and Rebecca Jo Plant's Of Age: Boy Soldiers and Military Power in the Civil War Era. It won the Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize for 2023. The prize winners are always good, so I shouldn't really be surprised that's it's good, but it's still such an impressive work that at least once a chapter they add something novel and important to the field. This work will probably fly under the radar of most of the legal field, especially in PCR work, but it has a lot of important new information on Habeas Corpus jurisprudence that needs to be followed up. 

I was also surprised to learn about their efforts to count underage soldiers in both armies and their conclusion that underage soldiers were at least as prevalent in the Union army as the Confederates. Their argument is compelling and based on their survey numbers, and their supporting records of petitions to the War Dept. and legal cases, along with social data like reporting and proposed legislation, I think their hypothesis is well supported. 

The book also does a good job at looking at the social change this created in both the North and South of the US and reset Adult/Child relationships in a way that fundamentally set the US up for an increasingly industrialized economy.

"Finished the books I've been reading over the previous weeks. One I would recommend and one I wouldn't. Reviews copied from my goodreads -

**Berlin: Portrait of a City Through the Centuries by Rory MacLean**

>3/5

>It was ok. The book covers the history of Berlin from around 1500 to the present day. Each of the chapters focuses on an individual's life in the city, some of these people are well known while others are very obscure.

>Some of the book is fictionalised so it's not all real history, which is a big flaw. The writing is a bit too flowery and pretentious for my tastes. The book is a bit too focused on the arts (actors, writers, etc) and not enough on politics for my taste as well.

>Some of the chapters were decent, I liked the chapters on Marlene Dietrich and Leni Riefenstahl the most. There was also a decent one about a loyal communist in East Berlin during the Cold War.

>Overall, I wouldn't recommend it due to some of the book being fictional. There are probably better books about the history of Berlin out there but this was a book I bought as it was cheap, I didn't seek it out so I have nothing to compare it to.

and 

**Vertigo: The Rise and Fall of Weimar Germany by Harald Jähner**

>4.75/5

>It is very good. The book is well written and just under 400 pages. It's mainly a social-cultural history of Weimar Germany with some politics and economics thrown in. A lot of the book is about the mood of the time and how the various crises of the Weimar Republic made people feel. The hatred seething in returning WWI soldiers who joined the Freikorps, the moral decline and confusion caused by hyperinflation in 1923, apathy from unemployment or fear of unemployment driving remaining workers towards the Nazis.

>Normally I'm not that interested in cultural history (the arts I mean) but I thought this book did the topic as well, as the arts are tied into the wider vibe of the Weimar Republic and the political debates of the time. For example, in the architecture chapter it mentions (a pretty silly) culture war of the day between people who preferred flat roofs or pointy roofs (nationalists and conservatives tended to prefer pointy). Tying the arts and culture to wider society and politics meant chapters on topics I normally have no interest in, like dancing, worked well imo.

>There was an interesting chapter later on in the book about the change in mood following the Great Depression. It basically says that the cultural progressiveness/modernity of the Weimar era was in retreat well before the Nazis took over. Dances and music became more slower traditional, women's hair cuts mostly reverted to pre-20s styles, longer skirts etc. The Nazi bans on things like jazz were targeting things that were already in decline in Germany.

>The last sections of the book are more politically focused and cover the failure of the Republic and the rise of the Nazis.

>The book isn't that heavy on statistics or policy which I think works in this instance as it is more of a social-cultural history.

>Overall, highly recommend it if you're interested in the Weimar Republic.

">At that time they would write on it while it was still malleable and then fire it to make it last.

It's been a while since I've been reading up on the subject, but IIRC clay tablets were typically not fired but simply allowed to dry (and presumably reused). All or at least most of the fired ones we ended up with are from unintentional conflagrations where the buildings the tablets were stored in burned down.

The tomb was found in the Corinaldo Necropolis in the Ancona province, located in the central Italian Marche region.

This burial ground dates back to the 7th century B.C. and is associated with the Piceni—an ancient Italic people who lived across what is now Marche and parts of the Abruzzo region, just to the south, between the 9th and 3rd centuries B.C.

The Romans referred to the territory of these people as Picenum. This ancient region was eventually incorporated into the Roman Republic.

The Corinaldo Necropolis has already yielded an exceptional find: what researchers dubbed the Tomb of the Prince of Corinaldo, uncovered in 2018.

Archaeologists have now discovered another princely tomb from the 7th century B.C. at the site, the local municipality of Corinaldo announced in a statement.

The research was undertaken as part of the ArcheoNevola Project, directed by the Department of History Cultures Civilization at the University of Bologna (UB).

This project has been active since 2018, in collaboration with the Municipality of Corinaldo and the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape (SABAP) for the provinces of Ancona and Pesaro Urbino.

Federica Boschi of UB and Cecilia Carlorosi and Ilaria Venanzoni of SABAP are leading the work at the site.

Recent investigations led to the discovery of a quadrangular pit of considerable size—about 12 feet by 7 feet—containing more than 150 artifacts. This pit, in turn, lies within a large, circular ditch with an original diameter of roughly 100 feet.

""Of particular note is the presence of a two-wheeled chariot and a prestigious set of bronze objects, including a helmet, a cauldron and numerous finely decorated containers,"" the municipality of Corinaldo said in the statement.

A number of the objects are clearly associated with banqueting, such as an iron ax for the processing of meat, as well as pottery designed to serve food and drink. Such finds paint a picture of the tomb's owner as a celebrated person ""of the highest order,"" according to the [statement](https://www.facebook.com/cittadicorinaldo/posts/pfbid0p5ynD7g4nwHG1dLKxVsna9o8iiDd93bGsvAVE8qEq61pdVgLePnjahLb6siLTrpwl).

Several of the objects appear to have come from the Etruscan world, with which the Picene aristocracy had relations and traded. The Etruscan civilization flourished in another region of central Italy between the 8th and 3rd centuries B.C.

The latest findings highlight the importance of the Corinaldo Necropolis site, particularly in reconstructing the earliest inhabitants of the territory.

""Corinaldo can boast the title of the Land of Princes,"" Mayor Gianni Aloisi said in a statement. ""A discovery that confirms the historical and cultural value of the Nevola archaeological area that will allow us to know, and perhaps rewrite, the history of our community.""

">Were stone tablets really that common back then

This thread is proof that this article did a horrible job. 

This is a *clay* tablet. Clay was a relatively cheap & disposable (though durable) writing material. Much cheaper than papyrus (or velum) and ink. A scribe could have prepared this as fast as you would write with a pencil. The tablet just has to be dried & fired afterwards.

Cuneiform on clay was widely used for thousands of years. Most of the known tablets represent ""accounting."" Tax, inventory, transactions, receipts, debts and suchlike. Prose, poetry, law and suchlike are relatively rare. 

This is (probably) not really actually a shopping list. It's some sort of financial documentation. An order, proof or order, receipt or something. 99% of cuneiform tablets represent something like this. Since clay is durable, museums have tens of thousands of clay tablets. 

Stone *tablets* are pretty rare. Stone ""stele"" (similar to a modern headstone) were used for important things like laws, religious texts. They usually include pictures, decoration, etc.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVDM2VYazcyWS1JNFc5WWRqZzJpeFhsdGdveVJOVFlEMFNRVlljN0lkdGFUMnhQZ08tQWk4RzFELXhXNXgtNVV4d29QMFdoZTdzeXhIWVFCVERLWnc4Q3c9PQ==

They had trade routes, and a lot of shipping was done over water, so fairly quickly depending on location. If the clay tablet was sort of an order form, the buyer would just send a messenger with the money and the order, and the furniture would be shipped back. 

I imagine the toil you mean is having to order the furniture online? If not, and you mean that you had to go in person for your furniture, the process the clay-tablet-writing person went through might have even been easier. 

If talking about ordering... Honestly it's not that much quicker. The only difference is the communication would be happening instantly.

"Yes it’s what we need but the biggest proposal currently — called FairVote — would do something similar. For our federal lower house —  FairVote would replace the single member first past the post districts with mixed member proportional districts. Basically each state would create districts with 3-5 representatives each. Then the seats of each district would be allocated proportional to vote count in the district. This can be done via Congress writing a new law. 


Unfortunately you can’t really fix our upper house (Senate) due to constitutional limitations. Our constitution basically guarantees senators will be elected as a single member district first past the post system. Since each state is guaranteed their equal representation in the senate, the senators serve 6 year terms & terms are staggered so no state elects two senators In same year. And each state controls the nature of their senator election. The only solution would be I guess adding more senators? But I don’t think anyone wants that.

"The intent of royal/aristocratic marriages were to manage/cement

1. Alliances between families, dynasties and countries. 
2. Personal economics. Brides in the past came with dowries and while they were intended to support the wife and children, the wealth and/or property infusion could come in handy at the right time. 
3. Inheritances - keep the titles and lands in the family at all costs. 

When taken to an extreme, the above ""positives"" got outweighed by the dramatic drop in genetic diversity in a blood line. This was one of the reasons that when I taught history to high school freshmen, they all learned this mantra: 

Dynasties went father to son, father to son, father to son to *moron*. 

All I had to do was start them on ""father to son..."" and they picked it up and quickly identified the moron (and the end of the line). It didn't always work but it made the point. 

They learned that little ditty starting in ancient Egypt and it was starkly shown with those wonderful Hapsburg portraits. 

Just because mummy and daddy arranged everything, it does not mean that the prince/baron/count/king would always willingly take the young lady in question as his bride. 

Probably one of the better known ones was the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne ""Flander's mare"" of Cleves (to be fair, [modern interpretations of Anne's portraits](https://www.royaltynowstudios.com/blog/blog-post-title-one-pxydc-3e4k2-lwr6a-kleed-dxwc4-cr3nm-welff-kkp9h-lzwy8-gz3dk-z97n3-7xlk8-g2kyc-dk646-ynpbs-py5tj-6aw9j-d7c6n-63rgp-jyrsa/) shows her as cutie). Henry was eventually strongarmed into marrying her. 

To be fair, these arranged marriages weren't forced marriages. You wanted some level of relationship (publicly at least) between the 2 people and you wanted them to produce an heir.

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Simple/Short/Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

"The discussion centers around the Bengal famine and allegations against Winston Churchill, which have become increasingly common and severe, particularly highlighted during a panel at Churchill College, Cambridge in 2021. These allegations suggest that Churchill was responsible for the famine, likening him to a mass murderer or war criminal. The speaker refutes these claims, explaining that the famine was caused by a typhoon in October 1942 that disrupted food supply lines and the inability to import rice due to Japanese control over key regions. They also highlight Churchill's efforts to seek aid from other countries, despite the challenges posed by the ongoing war and Japanese submarine threats in the Bay of Bengal.

The speaker asserts that while the famine was a tragedy resulting in millions of deaths, it is incorrect to accuse Churchill of deliberately causing it. They emphasize that Churchill's derogatory remarks about Indians, which were considered racist, do not equate to him wishing harm on them. The speaker also addresses accusations of Churchill's racism, contextualizing his views within the era's prevailing beliefs in racial hierarchies. They argue that despite these views, Churchill felt a duty of care to people across the British Empire, driven by a sense of responsibility stemming from his privileged background. The accusations against Churchill are framed as both historically inaccurate and part of a broader ideological and political campaign.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVMeUhVMW5ISUNKRzlCSU5jTXlGRy1qYjdDdFdNWkRuYkM1SHhfeWxycmNDYlhqaDgzQmxobEpGSkl6NmZzVnowMmZuVjFmVlRqdjVjWjZpY21DTHl4THc9PQ==

"Afghanistan is often referred to as the graveyard of empires, while Central Asia can be seen as the graveyard of singular nationalist histories. The Sogdians exemplify this, being one of the most significant diasporas in human history, rivaling even that of India.

In the 7th century CE, Kabul was ruled by Hindu Turk Shahs. To the north, across the Oxus (Amu Darya) river, lay a collection of city-states engaged in trade and conflict. Among them were the Sogdians, who practiced various religions including Buddhism, Mazdaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Judaism. Alongside them were diverse diasporas from Central, South, West, and East Asia, speaking a mix of languages, primarily Iranic with many Indic influences. These overlooked groups remind us that the past was a world without borders.

### In the Shadow of the Kushans

To grasp the significance of the Sogdians during their peak in the 7th and 8th centuries CE, we must first understand their earlier obscurity 500 years prior. The Kushan Empire was a dominant force across the Gangetic Plains, Afghanistan, and parts of Xinjiang, controlling key trade routes connecting the Indian Subcontinent to Persia, the Roman Empire, and distant China. Overland trade to China involved navigating the perilous Taklamakan Desert.

Trading through the desert was fraught with risk, as noted by historian Valerie Hansen in *The Silk Roads: A New History*. Transactions typically involved high-value commodities in small quantities, yet these could yield substantial profits. Judith A. Lerner and Thomas Wilde emphasize that items like ""horses from the Ferghana Valley, gemstones from India, musk from Tibet, and furs from the northern steppes"" were highly sought after in the ancient world.

Historian Étienne de la Vassière describes the Kushan Empire as a ""brilliant urban civilization"" that outshone the ""very mediocre situation"" of Sogdiana, roughly corresponding to modern-day southwest Uzbekistan and eastern Tajikistan. At that time, Sogdiana was relatively isolated from the major trade routes leading across the Taklamakan Desert, while Kushan merchants thrived in horse trading as far afield as China and Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, Sogdian traders began to integrate into these networks, establishing roots in Kushan cities while preserving connections to their homeland.

de la Vassière points out that Sogdian graffiti discovered along the Karakoram Highway, built between present-day Pakistan and China, indicates their settlement in the upper Indus River region by the 3rd century CE. One notable piece of graffiti is a Sogdian merchant's prayer to a local spirit for safe passage to visit his brother. These familial networks provided Sogdians with access to capital and market insights, giving them a competitive edge.

Simultaneously, Sogdians began to make their mark in China. Historian Xinriu Liu highlights in *A Silk Road Legacy: The Spread of Buddhism and Islam* that the earliest Buddhist monks in China were Sogdians, not native Indians. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, they worked in China, translating texts from Sanskrit to Chinese. de la Vassière adds that Buddhism wasn't a dominant force in Sogdiana at that time, suggesting these Sogdian monks were likely from merchant families that had settled in India, where they adopted Buddhism and Sanskrit before moving to China.

### Hindu Gods in Samarkand

Though the concepts surrounding Indian gods are ancient, they were never fixed entities; various groups worshipped and patronized them, influencing their evolution. This is evident in Buddhism and similarly applies to other contemporary religions, including Hinduism.

For instance, the Kushans portrayed Skanda as Mahasena, meaning ""Great General."" The Sogdians, influenced by this Kushan environment, returned to their cities with a blend of religious traditions that merged local Iranic fire-worship with new elements, preserving a distinct Sogdian identity. Samarkand, now in Uzbekistan and once the greatest Sogdian city-state, serves as an example. Based on the accounts of the famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, Liu argues that in Samarkand, the Buddha was honored with processions featuring torches and firebrands.

By the 4th century, although the Kushan Empire had fragmented, Sogdian diaspora networks thrived and grew in influence. By the 7th and 8th centuries, Sogdians had become leading foreign traders in China, and their distinctive costumes and dance forms gained popularity in the cosmopolitan Tang Dynasty. At the same time, there were notable South Asian communities in Sogdiana, with Indian monks achieving success in China. The wealth of Sogdiana is evident in the mansions of affluent merchants adorned with intricate frescoes depicting gods, myths, and even stories from the *Panchatantra*.

Sogdian interactions with foreign deities mirrored the dynamics of the Kushan Empire. While the Kushans’ adoption of Indian gods was driven by the imperial court, in Sogdiana, this was a more decentralized process, led by various merchant elites. Indian conceptions influenced the gods worshipped in Sogdiana, while Kushan influences shaped the deities venerated in India.

The Zoroastrian gods of the Sogdians had diverse attributes, and the established Indian artistic norm of multiple arms and faces provided a framework for their representation. In *Iranian Gods in Hindu Garb*, art historian Frantz Grenet cites Buddhist Sogdian texts mentioning composite deities like “Brahmā-Zurwān, Indra-Adhvagh, Mahādeva-Wēšparkar.” Their iconography, primarily influenced by Indian models, includes traits such as Brahmā-Zurwān with a beard, Indra-Adhvagh featuring a third eye, and Mahādeva-Wēšparkar having three faces. This last deity draws from the ancient Kushan composite god, Oēšo-Śiva, merging a cosmic wind god with the supreme Shiva. In Panjikent, a significant Sogdian city in modern Tajikistan, Mahādeva-Wēšparkar is depicted blowing a horn, emphasizing the connection to wind.

These cultural exchanges were intricate, not as a result of deliberate design but as an organic assimilation process. Over centuries, layers of influences accumulated in various directions. Grenet argues that some motifs traveled from the Gangetic region to Kushan contexts before reaching Sogdiana.

Consequently, 7th-century Sogdians may not have viewed these motifs or composite deities as ""Indian"" or ""foreign."" To them, these representations were simply part of their local context. It is only through a modern lens that associates specific religions with singular languages, peoples, and regions that the Sogdian pantheon appears unusual. However, the silent frescoes of dancing Shiva in Panjikent and depictions of elephant-riding gods battling tigers and leopards in Varaksha challenge us to perceive this ancient world beyond nationalist narratives. These connections, while not reinforcing contemporary notions of superiority or exclusivity, enrich our understanding of our ancestors' world and, by extension, our own.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVOTVZFZ3V2LXQydGZGZ0QyLVJMY05IZDZDMnpNRWI5VUFueXRSS243eVpZYnJSWkhmVDAzT0FjNjJMQUtFY1FkOW1GSzFrblJlRmhWRmRWSTdqazdCMWc9PQ==

"Hey! I'm Gabria and I'm a junior academic historian from the UK who reads pretty frequently, and I'm looking for recommendations to expand my collection of books on a particular set of topics ^^ I'm looking for more 'unconventional' or 'new angled' books (for example Camilla Townsend's 'fifth sun' is pretty unconventional as compared to other accounts of the fall of the aztecs) on a set of topics listed below. Most of these are historical topics so I'm mainly looking for nonfiction, however there are a few fiction topics too!

Nonfiction:
These are the topics I'm looking to expand on ^^ I have most of the standard 'must buy' books in these categories, so I'm looking for unique takes, studies on unseen characters or more academic peices that go into greater depth 

- Balkan Political Instability [20th Century]
- US Advancements in technology, foreign policy and law [1865-1970] 
- The Plantagenet 'Empire' [1155-1216]
- Late-Modern Britain [1945-2008]
- The Conquistador's and the Fall of the Azteca
- The Early Achaemenid Empire and the transition to modern Iran 
- Classical Art and Literature 
Also open to topic suggestions if you can give a list of good introductory books (note I'm not looking for any more US history 😭 almost as frustrating as studying the British Empire)

Fiction: 

I'm super into Lovecraft, Stephen King, Arthur Conan Doyle, Doeyovetsky, Camus, Kafka etc and I run a very sort of 'old gods' cosmic horror murder mystery dnd campaign, so im always looking for books that'll give tons of monster inspo ^^

"No, that's very much a part of the Lost Cause myth. There was corruption under Grant, but if you read about that period of history, there was just a lot of corruption. The government was beginning to take on larger public administration projects but didn't have much of an administrative bureaucracy to police corruption. 

Grant's star has been on the rise as Reconstruction as a whole has been reconsidered. There's something called the Dunning School in the historiography of the 2nd half of the 19th century in the US. It's named after William Dunning who was a prominent historian. He taught at Columbia and  a lot of his students became leaders in the field. They pushed a narrative that Reconstruction was corrupt, Black people were incapable of Democracy, and the South hadn't fought to enslave people. Since the 1960s this has been pushed back and for the most part refuted, and b/c of that Grant's reputation has been restored.

Grant had a lot of unique problems during his administration, he had a recalcitrant and corrupt supreme court, he had significant resistance to re Reconstruction in the House and Senate, and he was fighting an insurgency in the Southern states. With all that going on he was still able to get the first civil rights acts passed, he got the 15th Amendment passed, and did a lot to incorporate the western states into the US. Just because of what happened in the western US during his administration he would probably be in the top 20 presidents if it weren't for the insurgency in the south.

"Hi!   
  
It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false ""winners write history"" trope!  
  
While the expression is sometimes true in one sense (we'll get to that in a bit), it is rarely if ever an absolute truth, and particularly not in the way that the concept has found itself commonly expressed in popular history discourse. When discussing history, and why some events have found their way into the history books when others have not, simply dismissing those events as the imposed narrative of 'victors' actually harms our ability to understand history.  
  
You could say that is in fact a somewhat ""lazy"" way to introduce the concept of bias which this is ultimately about. Because whoever writes history is the one introducing their biases to history.  
  
A somewhat better, but absolutely not perfect, approach that works better than 'winners writing history' is to say '*writers* write history'.  
  
This is more useful than it initially seems. Until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that.  
  
To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes.  
Similarly the Norsemen historically have been portrayed as uncivilized barbarians as the people that wrote about them were the ""losers"" whose monasteries got burned down. 
  
Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.  
This evaluation is something that is done by historians and part of what makes history and why insights about historical events can shift over time. 
  
This is possibly best exemplified by those examples where victors *did* unambiguously write the historical sources.  
  
The Spanish absolutely wrote the history of the conquest of Central America from 1532, and the reports and diaries of various conquistadores and priests are still important primary documents for researchers of the period.  
  
But 'victors write the history' presupposes that we still use those histories as they intended, which is simply not the case. It both overlooks the fundamental nature of modern historical methodology, and ignores the fact that, while victors have often proven to be predominant voices, they have rarely proven to be the only voices.  
  
Archaeology, numismatics, works in translation, and other records all allow us at least some insight into the 'losers' viewpoint, as does careful analysis of the 'winner's' records.  
We know far more about Rome than we do about Phoenician Carthage. There is still vital research into Carthage, as its being a daily topic of conversation on this subreddit testifies to.
  
So while it's true that the balance between the voices can be disparate that doesn't mean that the winners are the only voice or even the most interesting.  
Which is why stating that history is 'written by the victors' and leaving it at that is harmful to the understanding of history and the process of studying history.

"Calling it Hinduism during this period is very, very strange, as Hinduism didn't really exist as a concept until British Colonialism. Hinduism is a conglomeration of a ton of different traditions, some directly competing and contradictory. Those traditions certainly existed, but calling these gods ""Hindu gods"" is a bit of a misnomer, no?

I dunno, I'm just very weary of any source that's western that feeds into the colonial viewpoint on the religion during the past few decades as the people of the Indian subcontinent try to figure out how they want to stand with their religious traditions.

It would be like calling Al-Lat a ""Muslim deity"", or Cybele a Christian one.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVVWXVXb2gyaUNFUGRQc3dVQXdYMTJ3NWdPMEc0ODNVbXVpN3BnNS0xT0VrZjN2MHpXQUhJdjFpOWJYRWdnbjZaVW95Y3J2WDBpTGQ5YUxNSTVXUFhrSmc9PQ==

"**Purpose**.  To determine the identity of the prototypical blind man repeatedly described by philosopher John Locke (1632-1704).

**Methods**. Historical books were reviewed.

**Results**. In several works, John Locke described a studious man he knew who went blind from smallpox at a young age.  This man struggled to understand visual concepts such as the yellow color of saffron, the clarity of the sun, or the color of scarlet, which the man compared to a trumpet.  Nonconformist minister John Troughton (1637-1681) went blind from smallpox at a young age.  Troughton was a fellow student with Locke at Oxford University.  Troughton’s sermons quoted the exact portions in Song of Solomon (Canticles 4-6) and Revelations (chapter 18) which contain the imagery (and the association of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets) found in Locke’s writings.  Thus, Locke’s comparison of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets was probably not a description of synesthesia, but rather was an attempt of a blind scholar to understand Biblical imagery.

**Conclusions**. The struggles of blind nonconformist minister John Troughton to understand Biblical imagery probably stimulated John Locke to ponder what humans can know innately about vision, independent of experience.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVXN0lIOEV4WGdvRXBxM2h6UUhnVFQ1cGowNlNtZ1pfZFZSandjMXBTV0l4QTJneXhBYWVuLWhoQkhub00wSGVDLXIxbmpnd0ZvSWl2Y1B4Y3ZybW1HMXc9PQ==

"You have göbekli tepe that's dated to 11,600 years old and the site has only been excavatied between 5 and 10% (If I'm up to date) although no signs of agriculture is present the site it self is very impressive and large and most likely required specific tools and knowledge to make, so to say that small stuff could slip by is and understatement.

Take the Amazon for example, in the early 1900 it was expected that no one could live there, not in any large capacity anyway. Machu picchu was rediscovered in 1911 and even then they wouldn't really recognise that there might be more large city's.
They have been very slow with admitting to big city's with a population of a million plus residents and that it wouldn't be possible. it's not until recently that they have started to admit that the city's in the Amazon are huge, much larger than previously believed. Research suggest that the Amazon forests are planted by humans due to the majority of the plants are fruit bering and the soil not being best suited for agriculture, so agriculture would not be as important. 

They still have a lot of ground to cover. The Sahara was a pretty nice place during the humid period that stretched from between 14 thousand to about 6 thousand years ago, and humans may have been a contributor to it turning to a desert. So there might be something under all that sand.

You also have the sphinx that geologists say are closer to 10 thousand years rather than 6 wich are the consensus of the Egyptologists and the current accepted theory.
The geoligists say that the erosion in the sphinx is from wind and water and not wind and sand, and the amount of water needed for that sort of erosion hasn't been present in that area since about 10 thousand years ago.

"The whole sphinx conspiracy is a game of telephone where misunderstanding has grown out of proportion to create a mystery where there is not one. 

The sphinx was built on top of an existing natural rock formation. That natural rock formation is where the ancient weather patterns evidence came from.

"Yes there are records from the conquistadors that they saw huge city's with millions of people, but that has unfortunately largely been dismissed and looked upon as exaggerated and not to be taken seriously. Bingham went on his expedition around the same time that Percy Fawcett did his first expedition after he maped The Amazon River and found some clay pottery, he was then convince that there was a lost civilisation in the jungel. When he shows the pottery to the academics he was laughed at and they minimised his findings with its just pots a pans.

"I wouldn't really call Critias scribbles or hallucinations, it's clearly a metaphor about political order and about cultivating the virtues that are outlined in the education system of the Republic. The Atlantis aspect is almost certainly just used as a metaphor to contrast the ordered and unordered life, with the ordered life (Athenians and Zeus's laws) superior to the disordered life (Atlantis and Poseidon's emotions). It's relation to Timaeus, which looks at similar themes in the order of nature and physics, and Plato's earlier dialogues like the Phaedrus, Crito, and The Republic joins it in a larger discussion about ethics and living the ""good life.""

"I'm far from an expert myself. I used the maya as an example how how wrong they can get it sometimes and be very slow to change their view, and that there's the same climate in the region where the maya where and the Amazon.
There's a great course on Wondrium (formally called the great courses) that's is about this topic you can probably find it elsewhere also. Unfortunately racism has been a part of archaeology and history through modern history and impacted it negatively. That's one of the reasons they wouldn't believe that the Amazon could have been home to large city's because that would make them equal and they didn't like that.

"Unfortunately I don't have a source I can cite of hand I have to look through the materials I have, I studied archaeology for one semester and going back now again, although it focuses mostly on Scandinavian archaeology and a bit of European, there's a lot we get to learn about the field itself and how it's looked at things through history since it became a thing. 
I'm really bad att keeping track of sources. But what I can give you is to watch ""lost worlds of south America"" on the great courses/Wondrium by Edwin barnhart, although his main focus is the maya. It's 24 ep 30 minutes lectures so if your interested I really recommend it, it's from 2012 so it might be a lite outdated on some things like the size of city's for exampel.

If you take göbekli tepe as an example of academics not wanting to change their opinion. When people started talking about an ancient civilisation around 12 thousand years a go they basically laughed at it and said it was impossible for megalithic structure to be older than 6 thousand years old, if there where they would have found it already or at least traces of it. And then in 1997 they dated göbekli tepe to 11,600 years old.

These books are wonderful for gaining general knowledge about the history of Rome and at the same time are very captivating even if you are not a huge history buff (which I'm not). They provide general overview of the period and its events and also chapters focused on society, culture etc.

"History as a hobby-

Hey guys. 

So basically I was wondering if anyone else found they had an interest in ancient history, whether is be Mesopotamian, meso-american or any other period, while they’re in college pursuing a completely different field.
Im a full time law student, however ancient history is one of those things im also passionate about. Since l’ve decided not to pursue a degree in it, l’ve since attempted to make it into a hobby.
One issue though: it’s tough and time consuming.
Attempting to study law while making time to read about history can be overbearing and my mind gets either fried or too tired.
Does anyone have any tips on making such as side project doable?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVmUzE0eVhSdWVZV1NyVXlkRnJKMmVTd254N0JEdnZIX3hicEF0U2lSY3pHNDl0a25KcVBaSHVzd0VQZGxLOUxnTHE3WW1YR294NnZLR0NQU000cGw2TDF0VWNXaldULUI4WHVHUWNiY3E1aHc9
"There are definitely people who do Ancient History and Law at the same time at university (it's a fairly popular undergrad at my university). But, if you've already decided you only want to do it as a hobby, then there's really no rush. Hobbies don't have exams, homework, or deadlines. So just take time when you have it and want to. The quickest way to ruin a hobby is to make it seem like work. 

But you still want to feel like you're progressing. I'd suggest finding some academic works instead of popular history. If you're studying law you should be able to follow them. Those will give you a better understanding and more of the complex understandings rather than just a wall of ""facts[1]"" that popular history tends to bring. ([1]the facts are often wrong, oversimplified, or very misleading, in popular history too)

"While there were no formal public education systems in place in the Roman Empire to specifically target improving literacy among the lower classes, there were some efforts to provide education to a broader segment of society.

One notable initiative was the establishment of schools by wealthy individuals or benefactors in some urban areas. These schools, though not widespread, aimed to provide basic education to children from lower-income families. Additionally, some emperors, such as Augustus, promoted educational reforms to encourage literacy and learning.

Furthermore, certain professions, like scribes, required literacy skills, so some individuals from lower classes would learn to read and write as part of their trade or occupation.

Despite these efforts, the overall literacy rates among the lower classes remained significantly lower compared to the elite and upper classes in Roman society.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVoLXl5T2JGbnVxVW1sQmdITFNvUDBtVEVVaU1aelRpZS1MVmRraHZxRFpBZzc5YmtTcHYzcVE1aXNzR1NhWFFaSXQ2NVpEOUtTVnAzb0hMVmpIQy1CVjJrRFVsRTRvSGVvUkUzY0VRZ0FpYjg9

"It turns out, there are 1,189 chapters in the Bible, and Revelations chapter 18 is the only chapter in the entire bible that talks about both scarlet and trumpets.

"Enlightenment philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) repeatedly wrote about a man who went blind from smallpox as a child, struggled to understand certain images, and compared the color scarlet to the sound of a trumpet.  Who was this blind man?

In his 1694 treatise, Locke wrote that he had known someone blinded by smallpox as a child:

“Suppose a Child had the use of his Eyes till he knows and distinguishes colours; but then cataracts shut the Windows, and he is forty or fifty years perfectly in the dark; and in that time perfectly loses all memory of the Ideas of colours, he once had.  This was the case of a blind Man I once talked with, who lost his sight by the small Pox when he was a Child, and had no more notion of colours, than one born Blind.  I ask whether any one can say this Man had then any Ideas of colours in his mind, any more than one born Blind? And I think no body will say, that either of them had in his mind any Idea of colours at all. His cataracts are couch’d, and then he has the Ideas (which he remembers not) of colours, *de novo*, by his restor’d sight, convey’d to his mind, and that without any consciousness of a former acquaintance.”[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)



[\\[1\\]](#_ftnref1) Locke 1694, book I, p. 35.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGVobFduVGJydllpQW85Q0RKQURrTlVBcUt6YUFPSF9nbUNXVXdNaXlhNGFETnQ5LURMNjhWbHFJUk1QN0pvQXNjdm5OVVM2d0dvN3VfMUhhMWcxLU1qTEE9PQ==
"Who could Locke have known who went blind from smallpox as a child, and then struggled to understand colors?  Perhaps, it was John Troughton (c. 1637-1681), who was blinded by smallpox at four years of age, and was at Oxford University from 1655 to 1662, initially as a student.[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)  Locke also studied at Oxford during that time.[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)  Troughton went on to become a nonconformist minister.[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)  Certain passages in Locke’s subsequent writings can be understood as a description of a blind theology scholar struggling to understand the imagery in the Bible.  In 1690, Locke wrote:

“But such an assent upon hearing, no more proves the Ideas to be innate, than it does, That one born blind (with Cataracts, which will be couched to morrow) had the innate Ideas of the *Sun*, or Light, or *Saffron*, or Yellow; because when his Sight is cleared, he will certainly assent to this Proposition, That *the Sun is lucid* \\[i.e. clear\\], or that *Saffron* is yellow.”[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)

Saffron is mentioned only once in the Bible, in Song of Solomon:

“Thy lips are like a thread of *scarlet*…Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with…Spikenard and *saffron*…Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, *fair as the moon, clear as the sun*…”[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)

Locke’s reference to a blind man pondering the color of saffron and how the sun is clear must be a reference to this passage in Song of Solomon.  As it happens, Troughton later paraphrased this exact passage in a sermon delivered in 1678: “Though the Church be *fair as the Moon*, she hath also many dark spots; though *clear as the Sun*, she hath her clouds and Eclipses.”[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)

"But the reference to scarlet in Song of Solomon must have challenged Troughton’s imagination.  In 1690, Locke recalled a specific instance of a blind man trying to understand the color scarlet:

“A studious blind Man, who had mightily beat his Head about visible Objects, and made use of the explication of his Books and Friends, to understand those names of Light, and Colours, which often came in his way; bragg’d one day, That he now understood what *Scarlet* signified. Upon which his Friend demanding, what *Scarlet* was? the Blind man answered, It was like the Sound of a *Trumpet*.”[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)

In the same “Sermon on Rev\\[elations\\]. 18.4. preached November 5. 1678”, Troughton compared the papacy in Rome to Biblical Babylon: “she \\[Rome\\] is arrayed in purple and *Scarlet*, decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, which is the garb of the Pope and his Cardinals”.[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)  Revelations 18 adds that those clothed in scarlet are associated with the sound of trumpets: “Alas…that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and *scarlet*, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!...And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and *trumpeters*, shall be heard no more at all in thee”.[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3) 

            There are 1,189 chapters in the Bible, and Revelations chapter 18 is the only chapter in the entire King James Bible to refer to both the color scarlet and trumpet(s) (or trumpeter(s)).[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)  And it is the chapter about which Troughton published a sermon!

            Troughton undoubtedly had to form some understanding of visual images, to understand the Bible, and to illustrate his sermons for his sighted parishioners.  However, Locke recognized the challenges that a blind person could face in discussing colors.  In 1693, Locke wrote that one must be acquainted with sensations to discuss them, and that it was “foolish…to set a blind Man to talk of Colours”.[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)  Troughton was a blind man who spoke about colors.

Some authors have believed that Locke’s story of a blind man who compared the color scarlet with the sound of a trumpet was describing synesthesia, in which one sensory modality, such as a specific visual stimulus, is perceived as another sense, such as a specific sound.[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)  But, the writings of Troughton illustrate how a blind man might associate the color scarlet and the sound of a trumpet, because both are striking, vivid stimuli, often associated with royalty, and, in the case of Revelations chapter 18, with imperial degeneration.

One could imagine, then, that Locke’s initial exposure to the question of what a blind man can know about visual stimuli came from someone like Troughton, a fellow scholar at Oxford, who was trying to understand Biblical imagery.

"I actually started reading all of Linda Schiele's stuff on the Maya back when I was a 1L. I would have weird dreams about CivPro if I didn't read something else before bed. Back when I was in law school, podcasts were new and youtube hadn't been invented. This is just if you're going to a US law school, I know it works a lot differently in the rest of the country.

I knew I had no intention of learning Mayan, Nahuatl, or any of the other languages. But I abused Lexis Nexus to find papers (and the school printers to print them) and just made binders of stuff. I didn't have that hard of time finding time to read it. I realized pretty early on that I was just going to be right about center of the bell curve and that only took about 20ish hours a week. I had a hard limit of only reading for an hour per class and as close to the beginning of class as possible to avoid dinking around. So, I usually organized as many of my classes as possible into Tuesday and Thursday and worked the other days of the week and read it in my free time. I would just get a book at a time, find papers, see what was cited in the papers and then read more. I wasn't studying for a degree, it was just for fun, but I think you could pretty easily do both if you wanted to. After 1L year, most of law school is a waste of time as far as learning useful things that will help you be a lawyer in the future.

But if your law school is connected with an undergrad institution, I would go talk to the professors in anthropology and history dept. You could probably audit a class for cheap/free if you wanted to and if not, they would probably share the syllabus from any relevant class.

"I’m reading Michener’s Carribean. 

There’s a chapter that follows Victor Hugues at the time of the French Revolution. Michener keeps referring to him as a former barber, which doesn’t seem to be accurate. He does caution that Hugues’ early life is not well known but it seems like he took a lot of liberties here.  

 Also he depicts a battle which brought part of Guadeloupe back under French control which opposes Hugues to a certain Admiral Oldmixon who is supposed to be from a family of planters from Barbados. Except this guy never existed and we know the name of the actual British commander and he was not from Barbados at all.  

 I find all those inconsistencies for the sake of romanticisation quite confusing if not upsetting.

I’m not reading this as a scholar and I know it’s not entirely accurate but I feel like it’s going too far. Is that a reasonable take ? Should I keep going or try some more factual if less engaging account of Carribean history ? 

Any recommendations ?  

 Thanks. ",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGV4QnVZT2lpOW92WEh1eW5JT3FmNlZEM1QwZnpfek9MTExmTjR1Z2RkSnpnTnQ5V29ramRVakd5X0otVlJkZEhIMllsbjF1X1BYVzIyaG9qNTV0N1VhcEE9PQ==

The palace at Nineveh has always fascinated me. Sennacherib, who predated Ashurbanipal by a bit (I think he was his grandfather), left some great iconography there.

> You would see against the night  sky, or the dark sky of the outer universe silhouetted, the ribs, the ribs made of wood as thick as a parsiktu vessel of the wreck of the Babylonian Ark
which, like the one in the Bible,  came to rest on a mountain. 

Speaking as a Christian (and this would equally apply for a Jew or a Muslim), I'm aware of the ""dog whistle"" effect, so am careful of the emotional appeal of the Noah's ark story to my subset of the public. Its still interesting to see how scripture can be used by historians. 


[t=934 in auto transcript](https://youtu.be/LUxFzh8r384?t=934)

> [In the cuneiform tablet signature] they always said, ""Mr. So-and-So,  son of Mr. So-and-So."" And the dad  
was called Iṣṣuru. Now ‘Iṣṣuru’ is  the Babylonian word for ‘bird’.
Now this is rather an interesting thing, because  we know all about peoples names in Mesopotamia.  
They usually meant something intelligible  like ‘Servant of Such and Such a God’,  
or ‘She’s Beautiful Beyond  Compare’ – no one is called  
Bird. There’s no other case of a person  called Bird, it’s not a very good name!
So what does that mean?
You look at this for the first time in the  museum case, which I hope you will now do,  
and peer through and make out the  details, you would think “Ah! I see,  
it’s a sort of birds-eye view of the world!”  Well I think that’s what it is. It’s a Birdy  
Birdy family, and this is a birds-eye view of  the known world and what lies beyond it.
So that gives it a special kind of warmth  of understanding. Because its failings as  
it were from a cartographical  point of view are irrelevant,  
it is not what they’re interested in.
And it’s given us a tremendous insight  into many aspects of Mesopotamian thinking,  


> It’s also a **triumphant demonstration** of  what happens when you have a very small  
totally uninformative and useless fragment  of dead boring writing that no one can  
understand and you join it onto something  in the collection which is much bigger
and a whole new adventure begins all over again! 

Regarding the triumphant demonstration, I'm still a little dubious of Irving Finkel's conclusion about the ""bird"" and the bird's eye view that looks like something from our culture which we are projecting upon theirs. In the space tech domain that I know better,  ""bird"" is slang for satellite (the solar panels looking like wings). This includes the Earth observation variety. But Babylonians had neither satellites nor TV drones. 

------

Is anybody else uncomfortable with seeing these ancient objects handled without gloves? 

Also this question of just pushing the recovered triangle into the hole in the tablet, doesn't fit with a common idea of forensics. Then glueing it in there actually seemed worse. What if a future researcher wanted to look at pollen or ancient chemical traces? 

My first idea would have been to 3D scan all the fragments and let a computer do a virtual assembly. Such software exists and was famously used to reconstitute the shredded Securitat archives from Roumania.

"Direct references to medical issues are rare outside of physical injuries discussed in medical papyri, but there is indirect evidence for damage to eyes. For example, votive stele dedicated by the artisans of Deir el-Medina suggest the villagers suffered from an unusual amount of eye problems, something first remarked upon by Battiscombe Gunn over a century ago. 

>*Two expressions for blindness are used in these texts: 'to see darkness by day' (IV, VI), and 'to see a darkness of thy making’ (VIII, XII, XIII). In the contexts in which they stand it is natural to take them as referring to physical blindness; but if this interpretation be correct it is very strange that this affliction should occur proportionately so often, and be at the same time the only one specified by the victims of divine retribution. Are we to infer that the decoration of the dark tomb-chambers of the Necropolis (for that was of course the work of the draughtsmen, sculptors, and perhaps of 'attendants' of the Place-of-Truth) was specially detrimental to the eyesight?*

"The first time I ever heard bout the Voynich manuscript was in the 90s in this super cheap (and probably quickly written) book about conspiracy theories that was being sold in a grocery store.

Anyway, it said Voynich was actually written by aliens in their language and they were just posing as humans. Being an idiot impressionable teenager (and this being the 90s, with it being much harder to fact check things) I just sort of believed it because I was dumb. (I also think that book is why I spent several years in my late teens and early 20s as a hardcore believer in almost any conspiracy theory I heard. Roswell? Definitely aliens. Area 51? Absolutely a testing ground for recovered alien technology. ""Chariots Of The Gods?"" was practically my bible at one point and I took everything it said as gospel.) Oh, and unrelated: But that same book said the Antikythera Mechanism was a navigation device from an alien spaceship that had accidentally been left behind on earth.

"Your description of Allegro's book reminded me of a recent book: Brian Muraresku: The Immortality Key.
Heard about it on [Lex Fridman's podcast](https://lexfridman.com/brian-muraresku/).

Depending on why you find Allegro's work interesting, this might also interest you.
ChatGPT-generated comparison of the two is below. Can't vouch for accuracy.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4NW04WmZYZFhLdVVUQ1ZZRng2V3R3ZWNPVFFuLWpuYW5Nc3hETnV6ZTh1eF9PUWJpT3ZCYlVGUEhBbEZ4aE44c1JUNnNnR29SRm51a3ZHb3QwU24zZVE9PQ==
"Yes, there are notable differences between the theses of Brian Muraresku's *The Immortality Key* and John Allegro's *The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross*, despite both books dealing with the intersection of religious history and psychoactive substances. Here’s a comparison of their key points:

### 1. **Core Thesis**:
   - **John Allegro**: Allegro's thesis in *The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross* is that early Christianity was originally a secret fertility cult centered around the use of the psychoactive mushroom *Amanita muscaria*. He argued that the stories in the Bible, particularly the New Testament, are encoded references to mushroom-based rituals, and that Jesus himself was a symbol rather than a historical figure. Allegro's work is largely philological, relying on speculative interpretations of ancient languages and etymologies to make his case.
   - **Brian Muraresku**: Muraresku's thesis in *The Immortality Key* is more focused on the broader ancient Mediterranean world rather than Christianity alone. He argues that certain religious practices, particularly those associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries and early Christianity, involved the use of psychoactive potions, which were central to the spiritual experiences of participants. Muraresku's work is rooted in a combination of archaeological evidence, ancient texts, and modern scientific research.

### 2. **Approach to Evidence**:
   - **John Allegro**: Allegro's approach is highly speculative and controversial. He bases much of his argument on his interpretations of ancient languages, particularly Sumerian, to draw connections between religious terms and psychoactive mushrooms. His work has been criticized for its lack of rigorous evidence and for making leaps in logic that many scholars find unsubstantiated.
   - **Brian Muraresku**: Muraresku takes a more cautious and interdisciplinary approach. He combines classical scholarship, modern scientific analysis (including chemical residue analysis on ancient artifacts), and an exploration of historical texts to build his case. His argument is more evidence-based, though it still ventures into speculative territory when drawing conclusions about the exact nature of ancient religious practices.

### 3. **Focus on Christianity**:
   - **John Allegro**: Allegro's work is almost entirely focused on early Christianity. He argues that Christianity itself was fundamentally based on mushroom worship, with all of its symbols, rituals, and narratives being allegories for psychoactive mushroom use.
   - **Brian Muraresku**: While Muraresku does discuss early Christianity, his focus is broader, encompassing the religious practices of ancient Greece, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries, and their potential influence on early Christian rituals. He does not claim that Christianity was a mushroom cult, but rather that certain psychoactive substances played a role in early Christian and pre-Christian religious experiences.

### 4. **Reception and Impact**:
   - **John Allegro**: Allegro's book was met with widespread criticism from scholars and religious communities alike. It damaged his academic reputation, and his theories have largely been dismissed by mainstream scholars as highly speculative and lacking credible evidence.
   - **Brian Muraresku**: Muraresku's book, while controversial, has been more positively received, particularly among proponents of the emerging field of psychedelic studies. It has sparked renewed interest in the possible connections between ancient religious practices and psychoactive substances, though some scholars remain skeptical of his more speculative claims.

### 5. **Religious Interpretation**:
   - **John Allegro**: Allegro's thesis is radical in its reinterpretation of Christianity, effectively arguing that the religion we know today is a misinterpretation or cover-up of a psychedelic cult.
   - **Brian Muraresku**: Muraresku does not suggest that Christianity as a whole is based on psychedelics but rather that these substances may have played a role in specific religious experiences or rites, particularly in the context of mystery religions that may have influenced early Christian practices.

In summary, while both authors explore the connection between psychoactive substances and religion, Allegro presents a far more radical and narrowly focused thesis on early Christianity, grounded in linguistic speculation, whereas Muraresku takes a broader, more evidence-based approach that places early Christianity within a wider context of ancient religious practices that may have involved psychoactive substances.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4aHRrQXQzcGk2YWoxbHhYSURrbW50Sko3WXVhXzc2VUsxdnFVMVhpY0lzWERJNVR4bFhwVFEwbGRfcGtJSU9HUUF0MC1jTkNHUEVfSFk4dW1QRTFlaUE9PQ==

">Both Chrome- and Firefox-based browsers also have browser extensions which do exactly the same thing as the above sites - just search your browser's extensions store for the word ""paywall"".

I highly recommend Bypass Paywalls Clean for both [Firefox](https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-firefox-clean) and [Chrome.](https://github.com/bpc-clone/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean) 

I have no idea why the ""clean"" is in its name, because anything that has to advertise that usually sets off red flags, but I've been using it for years and it's been the most reliable method of automatically bypassing paywalls on any site that allows people to view a limited amount of articles in a certain time period.

If it's a site that requires a log-in before any content is shown, it won't work, but for sites like The Atlantic or other publications that'll let people read one or two articles per month, it works. You can also add custom sites, like local news websites, to bypass their paywalls. 

Essentially, whenever you click on a link to any site in its list, that tab/window has its user agent changed to a web crawler like Google's, its cookies/cache is cleared, etc. to make the site believe you're just a Google bot and let you see the article in full.

>And sometimes, articles aren't really ""paywalled"" at all - they just have popups or other HTML elements that obscure the article. In that case, enabling your browser's ""reader view"" will let you read the original article.

For that, I use [Behind the Overlay,](https://github.com/NicolaeNMV/BehindTheOverlay) also on Firefox and Chrome; works a *lot* easier than the old method of trying to hunt down the HTML using your browser's developer tools, and it re-enables all page features that get disabled when the overlay kicks in.

"The sources are literally scientists that specialize in carbon dating.


>Radiocarbon dates are generally presented with a range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) on either side of the mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only a 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution of errors in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4,250 to about 4,390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4,520 to about 4,690.[78]",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGU4LUkzcXliRlg2SEV6dFhYZU8yZENQTmk4Y09DVDBTalFxRVRaSXFlWkVuMy1Mb3BPMU90QWxoWVFIeWw0SFFxNkl2XzU1Y0U2VXRyUXRVbTN2NGU0QVE9PQ==

I mention it because this is not a logical extension of the various listed attempts (other than the actual sample dating). I haven't seen anything on anyone attempting to lock down the context for the manuscript in the political, ecumenical or societal structures, especially given the recent addition of the five-scribes piece of the puzzle.

*Where* was it made? Of the possible locations, where were the places in the world where you could even have five scribes working in tandem?

One of the main points Davis makes is pretty much everyone coming at this is doing so intuitively from a perspective with a theoretical skin in the game in the form of investment in a particular answer; you don't see a lot of people just going ""Maybe each page needs to be manipulated like a *Mad Magazine* Fold-In?""

"Many of the founding and originator fathers in Greek and Roman history. Romulus and Remus myth started centuries after Rome was ""founded"", around the time people started embracing a Roman identity and the story was made to essentially give them an origin when there really was none. Lacedaemon, Theseus, etc. as well. Some people like Lycurgus are semi-legendary in that they may have existed, but their life and attributions don't likely reflect their actual reality. Same thing can be sad about people like Ragnar Lodbrok, we know he lived, as we know about his sons. But his life story is probably mostly fiction. 

Homer existed in the sense that someone at some point started what became the Iliad. However, it's highly unlikely that one person created the whole story, and even more so that one person also wrote the Odyssey. One is clearly inspired by the other, and uses it as a launching pad, but the style is different other than when it is referencing the Iliad. Sometimes ""Homer's daughter"" is used to refer to the poet of the Odyssey because the role that women play in the Odyssey, but this is more just poetic itself rather than a real possibility.

"Well, there's quite a bit to unpack here...

For one thing, witch hunts were not much of medieval thing, the Malleus was published at the very tail end of the Middle Ages, and most witch hunts were a thing of the early modern period. There were some earlier witch hunts and there were witchcraft and other magic accusations against specific people, but the witch unts of pop culture mainly happened after the Middle Ages. Also, it was not a phenomenon throughout Europe, some areas could really be describes as being ravaged by witch hunts, in others it was isolated cases, in some ares there were none. The Holy Roman Empire (or, more precisely, some of the constituent parts of the Holy Roman Empire) experienced extensive witch hunts, there's also a lot of cases in the neighbouring areas of Switzerland and France, many areas in southern Europe had much fewer cases, Scandinavia did have witch hunts, but not on the same level (and, interestingly, with a lot more men accused than women). Britain had some prominent examples, but again, not on the same scale as the HRE. There's also famously cases outside Europe (especially Salem, of course).

As to the death toll being comparatively low, that does of course depend on what you compare it to. The Black Death or the Thrity Years War certainly claimed a lot more lives (and we're talking orders of magnitude here), and that is true for a lot of medieval and early modern military conflicts. The crusades, the Hundred Years War, the English Civil War all had a higher death toll. That being said, this is a comparison between major military campaigns and people essentially burning their next door neighbours out of paranoid fear. At this point we're asking whether killing 50.000 people for a completely imagined crime or killing millions in a horrendous military campaign is worse. (Also, many of these other catastrophes were part of the background of insecurity and fear that was an important contributor to the witch craze)

You're right that the role of the church or churches in this is somewhat complicated. The rather common depiction in pop cukture of the inquisition burning witches at the stake is indeed not accurate, to say the least. On the other hand, there is clearly an important religious component - for example, there is hardly any witch hunts in Orthodox country, and none in Muslim controlled areas (and this includes Christian territories under Ottoman rule)

The official position of the Catholic church for most of the Middle Ages was that there was, in fact, no such thing as witchcraft (as far as I understand it basically because this would imply supernatural power from a source other than God), meaning that belief in witchcraft was against church doctrine. So you couldn't really accuse someone of witchcraft, because that would essentailly mean you held the heretical belief that witchcraft was real. And if you really practiced something you believed to be witchcraft, your crime was that belief, not your magical practices. On the other hand, the idea of a pact with the devil was already present in Augustine's writings and was picked up by Thomas Aquinas, so some of the essentail framework for later witch hunts was already present. 

The main task of the inquisition was always rooting out heresy. As such, they were not terribly interested in witches - and might actually not even believe in their existence. This actually means that in countries/areas where the inquisition had a lot of influence (like, for example, Spain), there were very few witchcraft trials.

On the other hand, the author of the Malleus Maleficarum was an inquisitor - albeit one in constant conflict with church authorities. So the inquisition was obviously not immune to the ideas which led to the witch craze, but it was not a major proponent of those ideas. In fact, a lot of the trials were not even held in church courts, but in secular courts (which also means that the willingness of secular authorities to prosecute people for alleged witchcraft was an important factor in determining where witch hunts did or did not happen).

What makes it obvious at once that witch hunts were not tied to the inquisition in any way is the fact that a lot of witch hunts took place in Protestant territories. Luther calling for the prosecution of witches from the pulpit obviously didn't help there, nor did James VI and I's fear of witches later on. 

As to further reading, back when I did this stuff at uni a good 20 years ago I seem to remember that Wolfgang Behringer's work was rather highly regarded. Just tried to google whether that is still the case, but apparently he has written a very controversial book about the history of climate in the meantime (with some rather stupid claims from what I can gather), which doesn't say anything about the validiy of his work on witchcraft, but pretty makes googling him rather complicated... If you want to read up about witchcraft accusations before the major witch hunts (mainly as a tool against politically powerful women) Gemma Hollmann's Royal Witches is a good read. Richard Kieckhefer's Magic in the Middle Ages is also useful for a lot of the background story. I haven't gotten around to reading Marion Gibson's Witchcraft. A History in Thirteen Trials. yet, but it certainly seems wirth a read as well.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGUtV3FZV2Y5TUhfOS05RmNaekRUNFVRdDFZUlNPTVZWTkx3c2RDS3EtMHp2b2ZQdktmejBubkY3aGZnYUxfY3E3V2xLSHFfd25rb3RtN2dJQndBQUh6eFE9PQ==

"Thank you for sharing.  Excellent morning read to get the wheels turning.

I’d like to think the manuscript was a joke by a brilliant group of scholars passed down for the sole purpose of engaging creative minds to explore its mysteries.

I hope to one day read an article which proclaims, “Voynich Solved!” Followed by the simple sub-heading of “Authors Having a Lark.”

The large amount of scholarly and computational bandwidth that’s been thrown at trying to find even a hint of a solution makes me think it’s not likely to be solved, not because it’s unsolvable, but because the original authors wrote it to be so.

"I wanted to share this cool story:

There is this dude in Chinese history called Sun Bin, who was supposedly a descendant of Sun Tzu and wrote his own Art of War (according to the folklore). Anyway his story was that he was a genius (of course) and studied military strategy with his good friend Pang Juan, but Pang Juan got jealous and framed Sun Bin when they were both serving under the king of Wei. The King had Sun Bin's kneecaps crippled, which was a humiliating sentence and effectively ended his military career. Sun Bin knew he was still not safe as Pang Juan still wanted to extract his remaining knowledge before killing him, so he feigned madness and ate faeces in a stable to decieve Pang Juan into thinking he was really mad. He later escaped to the kingdom of Qi and became that king's military advisor. Later, while Pang Juan became the chief military general of Wei's armies, Sun Bin exacted his vengence by using all sorts of military strategems to defeat him. For example, when Wei's armies besieged the capital of the kingdom of Zhao (another kingdom) and Zhao asked Qi for help, Sun Bin didn't attack Wei's armies directly but instead attacked another city called Pingling. Feigning weakness, he deliberately lost to decieve Pang Juan into thinking his armies were weak. When Pang Juan had successfully taken the capital but suffered heavy losses, Sun Bin then immediately moved south, making a beeline for the Wei capital. Hearing this, Pang Juan took his calvary and rushed straight south, falling into Sun Bin's trap and getting defeated (Battle of Guiling). This became the famous ""besiege Wei to relieve Zhao"" strategem listed in the 36 Strategems, another famous military classic. Another climatic battle was at Maling, where Sun Bin feigned defeat and lured Pang Juan by reducing the number of cooking fires in his camp over three days, making Pang Juan think he was getting weaker and his men were deserting. He then lured Pang Juan into a valley where an ambush was prepared, and he had carved the words ""Pang Juan dies under this tree"" on a tree. When Pang Juan arrived in the night he saw the words and lit a torch to get a closer look, and then got shot to death and his army got defeated.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZGNFk1VlB3OU96dXdCMEtZVnB3c25zVkl5aFRoSWxqc2l6NThacGxhdzl4dWd0NUxwZkI5VmhTRmZzT1lpR3lZdXdueEpLSnl6TzJnY2xRaGhwOTVuNkRrcVlMQWNRcVg4Nld2MmV1X1Jualk9

"A lot of ""why didn't \\[technology\\] take off in the Americas?"" questions have the same answer: it did, but *locally*.

That applies to agriculture, writing, early pottery, domesticated animals, and indeed to metalworking: regional civilizations independently invented and developed the technology... but it *didn't spread.*

Or at least, not fast enough.

We know that civilizations in the Northern Andes had metalworking three thousand years ago, and they continued developing the technology throughout the centuries: hammering, mining, smelting, quite sophisticated techniques.

But it took *over two millennia* for that knowledge to spread to Central America.

When it did, the Mesoamericans really went hog wild with it. Metalworking became an important part of Mesoamerican societies within a few centuries, and by the time the Spanish arrived some Mesoamericans had already tentatively started using metal tools and weapons.

Similarly, people in the Great Lakes regions had been making copper tools for up to seven thousand years, and there's some evidence of people in the Pacific Northwest making iron tools. But the iron tools never spread, and the use of copper only spread south to the Mississippian region *very* slowly; and never reached Mesoamerica.

And that's a huge difference with the Old World. The first large scale metalworking in West Asia and the Balkans happened some seven thousand years ago -- not that much earlier than in North America. But instead of staying local to the region, it spreads rapidly: the rest of Europe uses it within centuries, Egypt within a millenium, India within two millenia.

So almost immediately you have this broad interwoven network of civilizations exchanging on ideas, techniques, raw materials -- and that *really* helps improve metalworking.

Like... Britain was famous for its tin deposits. It's not hard to imagine British civilization independently inventing a use for tin. But then what? What can you do with just tin? Not much. But instead, Britain was part of a continental network exchanging goods and ideas, and that British tin was used to make bronze all the way in Asia.

And that is the main thing the Americas lacked. If Andean ideas on mining and smelting gold had made its way to Mesoamerica in centuries instead of millennia; and if Great Lakes copper tools had made its way to Mesoamerica as well; and if the combination of the two ideas had made its way back to the Andes and the Great Lakes; and back; and forth; and back; and forth... *then* things would have started rolling.

Instead, every American civilization needed to invent the techniques independently, and only with the materials they had available locally, and because of that its use never left the niche it was originally invented for.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHZm56S01nY3RJekhiT1lhMllRYW56TGpMQi1uMmhRR29NNVhXX1NFbkwyS2E1YnV0bzVhTmJJVlNJbnpEbEdiYnQ4Rm5hY3BzM0hDN242Z3hUZ2ljRWc9PQ==

Elections in the Netherlands are not winner takes all and we don't elect our head of state or our government. We elect our representatives in parliament by the system of equal representation. Those elected should find a majority within the parliament and once there is such majority those parties involved can decide who's in the executive branch as minister or prime minister. After that our head of state rubber stamps the process.,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZHNW02dV94eW5KSFd6aUVkUnFIMmdDVnRsdXZvMk1KdGprS3NtaUY1S2pmblh4LXRzemVqcUljaklMTDJ6NTl2ZHBPbEdMTzQ1TDlzRzl2Z2d4SkVWcVE9PQ==

"Hello all! I was just wondering if anyone can help me with getting more information on a person? so I have recently acquired a post card sent from a man named Shimizu Toyoo. What I know about him is that he was a commanding officer of the Kyoto Kempei Buntai, military police unit which I think was a section of the Kempeitai in WW2. I also know he was sentenced as a war criminal in China after the war ended, and along with around 114 others was executed in 1947, his case number was 2985. But even with all this information I can’t find any information about him online. Like what specific war crimes he committed, just more general information on him, what he looks like, ECT. I just can’t find anything. So I was hoping someone with a bit more expertise and knowledge in this subject, could maybe help me.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIdnljZWk0akxSOXM4UHJUUG1nbDZFYXlUQ05KTlJkTUFvelZ2WlVWT3l6WW1rWFo4ZG1GU3Ezc2xFRzZ0cGl4d1VZTC1jbWQ1ZlNtSV9zV0VFdGVXbWtLMmhfUGJMekFxa2UwaElJek83WE09
"I'm wondering if anyone has any book recommendations for like a novel or historical mystery (for adults) on the Iroquois Confederation? My younger sibling is an archeologist who has been obsessed for many years with Roman history. I lent them a book many years ago from my own Latin class called Catalina's Riddle, which they loved (as in LOVED!!! I never got it back). It's a mystery novel set in the time of the Catilinarian conspiracy, which is well-written, includes a lot of accurate historical details, and overall is just a good read. Long story short, I'm trying to support a career/interest pivot (kinda?) by helping to stoke an interest in Native American history in the same way that I helped cultivate the Roman obsession. I figured that the Iroquois confederation, as one of the most well-known/documented parts of Native American history would be a good place to start (happy to be told differently). So any recommendations that are compelling reads, with a lot of historically accurate detail, but preferably an historical mystery novel (because they're kinda big on thriller-type media) would be very welcome!",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZIc21odW1vbFd6TFE3MGFNUFJWUlkwT2hSVnU4OVEzRlJTYVBzSm9kWldWeWh3R21oeGVDQVVlR19KLTlKMXFjbWdjc1hZTDZQQ1JOUkdOSEdmeUxCZUE9PQ==

"What do the term “bureaucracy” means speaking of URSS?

For the past few months, I’ve been developing an interest in Russian history, particularly after the 1917 revolution.
Often, when discussing the country after the creation of the USSR, I frequently hear or read the term ‘bureaucratization’ or, more generally, that ‘the bureaucracy ruled,’ but I’ve never fully understood what it means.
I’m currently reading a book about Stalin, and here too I encounter issues related to the bureaucracy of the USSR. I’m sharing the translated text (from Italian) of the page so that someone might better understand the context I’m referring to:
“…Returning to public matters, he wanted to check on the situation and found that in his absence bureaucratisation had made giant strides, so much so that even his orders (…) sometimes got bogged down in the mysterious intricacies of complicated procedures…”",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZJR3JaQl9HVEpYT2xDeGxpOWZldWhPSnk1bTdhRXJZcE9QSFVyc0tqVm5Vd0tkM1BxcGhnejFiWHZXZWlVcXN0RUl1VTZrMVpVTnFROEdLNHdtWlJwSnNQMkxnZXVNRXRZajlRaVFJWUl1VXM9

"Naturally - it's a good starting point though to then get some bearings.

It's like asking your college roommate who had a class in X or Y, or in this case, read the cliff notes and reviews of both these books and gives you his ""anecdotal impression"" while washing the dishes. It's broad strokes enough to decide whether you care to spend your time going deeper.

It effectively serves as a 'prompt' for me when doing some research, get an idea of what questions to look for answers to when looking at original sources.

"Finished **Germany 1923 by Volker Ullrich** . Review copied from my Goodreads.

>4.5/5 being harsh and rounding down for Goodreads.

>I really enjoyed the book. It covers the politics and society of early 1920s Germany pretty well. The book takes a more thematic approach than purely chronological which personally I thought was done well. In particular I thought the chapters on the societal impact of hyperinflation and on the rightwing enemies of the Weimar Republic (including conservatives, business and military figures, and Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch) were great. There was also a chapter on Rhineland separatist movements which was interesting and a topic I haven't really read about before. The culture chapter was decent but nothing special.

>The only chapters I found difficult to follow and less enjoyable were the coalition government chapters. There's a lot of political parties with acronyms to remember. SPD = social democrats and KPD = communists is easy enough to remember. But there are a lot of DNP, DNVP, DDP, etc which was confusing. It comes with the topic so maybe unfair to blame the book for it though.

>I enjoyed it enough to recommend it if you're interested in Weimar Germany.

"> How was the Alter Stone moved? Over land or sea?

Try reading the article ;)

>> “Given major overland barriers en route from north-east Scotland to Salisbury Plain, marine transport is one feasible option,” said the lead author, Anthony Clarke, of Curtin University.

> But the archaeologist and writer Mike Pitts, who was not involved in the research but whose work on Neolithic monuments includes the book How to Build Stonehenge, said he believed it was more likely the stone was dragged overland than floated by sea.

>> He said: “If you put a stone on a boat out to sea, not only do you risk losing the stone – but also nobody can see it.” Instead, a land journey, perhaps taking many years, would engage people en route, with the stone “becoming increasingly precious … as it travels south”, he added. Impossible as it may seem today, an overland journey “was easily within the reach of Neolithic technology”.

French here: Having seen the complicated way they went about transporting the Olympic flame to Paris, I'd believe anything.

"According to Hesiod, the Macedonians would not be considered Greek. But luckily for you and me, we don't have to rely on Hesiod to determine whether or not Macedonians were Greek.

To be fair, no one considered themselves to be ""Greek"" during that time period. There was no concept of a unified people called Greece. There were Athenians, Spartans, Thebans, etc.

Macedonians lived in Greece. They spoke a Greek dialect. They worshipped Greek Gods. They had identical architecture to Greece.

>Modern scholarly discourse has produced several hypotheses about the Macedonians' place within the Greek world. Considering material remains of Greek-style monuments, buildings, inscriptions dating from the 5th century and the predominance of Greek personal names, one school of thought says that the Macedonians were ""truly Greeks"" who had retained a more archaic lifestyle than those living in southern Greece. This cultural discrepancy was used during the political struggles in Athens and Macedonia in the 4th century.

If you're familiar with the geography, it would have been such an incredibly difficult task to get something that size all the way down to the south of England, rugged mountain ranges, thick forests, boggy marsh land etc. And lets not even start on the typical weather we get....

I only copy pasted what the researchers said, assuming they had addressed these practical questions. When archeologist Mike Pitts talked of the stone being ""dragged overland"", I'd assumed he meant a neolithic equivalent of a low loader. That looks like lashing the stone to a wooden sledge and pulling it along over tree trunk rollers. They'd also need ropes which apparently were already  available.

However its seems that Stonehenge is situated [around 2500 BC](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/history-and-stories/history/) at a time wheels existed. It seems wheels had already been around for [1000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel). IDK if they existed in England at the time.

IMO, the biggest challenge would be to plan a feasible route taking account of physical and human obstacles (there might be no-go areas).

">That was written by Demosthenes himself,

That was RECORDED by Demosthenes. He recorded Phillip's letters, and it's largely considered authentic. He was calling upon them to resist him. The fact that he was so strongly anti-Phillip and still included the bit in there where Phillip mentioned his Hellenic status is a pretty big clue that it was from Phillip and not Demosthenes. Demosthenes got shat on by some of his own contemporaries for his bias against Phillip -- and really it was more of Phillip that he hated, not so much the Macedonians. 

Demosthenes was an Athenian and a Greek

Phillip was a Macedonian and a Greek. His mother was Lynkestae, and a Macedonian, and a Greek. 

That Greek bit did not matter too much to people during their lives, outside of a general recognition of shared language, customs, religion. They were not united, they were not buddies, they were not a state. The Macedonians worshipping the same gods, speaking the same language (albeit a dialect, which every single other city-state also spoke a variant of, there is not one ""ancient Greek""), and generally following the same culture as others made them Greek. They definitely had their own uniquenesses, but again so did every group we consider ""Greek"". The Spartans were constantly ridiculed, mocked, and had serious accusations thrown their way by Athenians for their terrible cultural differences... but no one consideres for a second that they weren't Greek. They just had their own flavour of Greek-ness. 

The Greek label does not mean as much in antiquity as it does today beyond Othering. But Othering existed within the Hellenic states as well. The issue of some not seeing Macedon as Greek is part of this othering. Basically they saw them as rednecks. Hill folk. Not as cultured as the Athenians. But, again, these sorts of accusations are thrown against a lot of other city-states as well. 

A final point to draw attention and clarity to this process would be to look towards how Greeks viewed Barbarians. You have terms that mean ""to talk like a Barbarian"" or ""to be like a Mede (Persian, in this case), but you also have these same sorts of insults geared towards those who dressed like, or were kind to, or enjoyed, Spartan culture. It was an insult, because they were so different. These insults naturally became more prevalent around the time of the Peloponnesian War. We see something similar happening around that time where Amazons were shown dressed like Spartan women, not to completement them, but to show them as barbaric and backwards. Demosthenes is writing to turn the people against Phillip. He's writing in a time where he sees Macedon as becoming hegemon and wants Athenians  to wake up. His comments are more propaganda than anything, but it's what the Greeks did.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZTbnVpSTdjYmU4SmhsekJLQ2tBOHpGdkhvQWxPN0NFdnVpTTdJR05MSXE4N1lrUUM3M2FEYmhhRTZmdzdUdHhpbjR1Y09HaGxfNW54ald6NG1FQWhCbWc9PQ==

"There is no ""right"" history as long as your argument is supported by the evidence. In fact, the majority of historians don't research war or the military. There may be aspects that you have to keep in mind, but that's something you have to do in every field. 

My speciality is war adjacent, but I don't walk much about war itself. I talk about how people interacted with each other in the scope of the military and society viewed various members within that. So I have to acknowledge that war exists, but it generally isn't my area of interest. I also have to be aware of religion, as it pops up, but I'm not writing about religion. If you open an Italian restaurant you don't have to serve canollis, but you want to be aware of them, and able to discuss the basics. 

So if you're interested in humanitarian history that's absolutely an area you can expand into. But humanitarian crises often go hand-in-hand with warfare. So you might be researching the humanitarian reaction to the Somali Civil War, where you would be expected to know the basics around the war, the various parties involved, etc. but only to show you understand what the stakes were when discussing the humanitarian responses, if that makes sense. Just like I need to know why a soldier may make an offering to the gods even if I have zero interest in religion. 

But if you take anything from what I've written, I'd suggest you sit down with your advisor at school. If there's a certain lecturer/professor that has been getting you interested in humanitarian stuff, I'd have a meeting with them too. Or if there's just one you feel comfortable with -- even if they're a military historian. We all know people across hundreds of different fields in history. I've shared offices with historians that covered quilts, Scottish dress, same sex love letters in ancient Egypt, crypts and burial customs, etc. and have been present in so many conference talks about historical topics I never even thought about.

"Absolutely. But, whatever it is would need to be able to exist and be relatively easy to find. 

The existing is the hard part. Using stone would be most effective as far as longevity is concerned. Rock of a different type, moved a ridiculously long distance, once realized by a future sentient life would indicate to them that intelligence of some kind existed and constructed it.

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)

"Hi!  
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. Below you'll find a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

"While India wasn't a single political entity, it was a little more complicated that ""kingdoms at war with each other""

You're not wrong at a basic level that the subcontinent was several kingdoms jostling for regional and trans regional power. The video is right about this as well.

But there was a broader political and sovereign framework that they operated within that had been deeply structured by the Mughals. There was a shared sense of an entity within which they all existed and one of the best gauges of this is how different kingdoms recognized the nominal sovereignty of the Mughals as a means to exercise legitimacy. Hyderabad, Awadh, Bengal, the Jaipur kingdom all continued to seek nominal status within the mughal state, even though the mughal emperor's actual political power was significantly constrained. Mysore would similarly try to seek Mughal recognition and when it failed due to the objections of Hyderabad they declared themselves Sultans. But that lack of legitimacy also undermined their ability to hold power, and their conflict with the British eventually toppled them. The British were able to displace Tipu Sultan far more easily than many other royal families.

The Marathas are the slightly odd element in this and in part because Maratha history has become deeply enmeshed with nationalistic and sectarian memories. So the modern vision is of the Marathas as ""Hindu"" rulers looking to overthrow the ""alien Muslim"" Mughal empire, almost all of it a 20th century framing. While the Marathas did claim imperial status under the Chattrapatis, their grand imperial claims only really lasted a few years under Shivaji and his son. After the death of Sambhaji power shifted to the Peshwai and the Maratha clans and these people were perfectly happy to recognize both the Chattrapati (a title that was incidentally contested between two families at Satara and Kolhapur due to a disputed succession) and the Mughals. Famously for instance in the late 18th century Mahadji Shinde was actually one of the strongest supporters of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam and held the position of Grand Vizier.

The East India company operated in the same way too. The EIC had formally sought broad recognition from the Mughal Empire so that they could operate in the subcontinent. It was crucial to gain legitimacy and acceptance in the eyes of Indian elites whose collaboration they needed. After 1764, they received formal status as the Diwans of Bengal, which was still nominally a subordinate to the Mughal empire. They would pay their national tribute, and engage in the rituals of subordination throughout the 18th century.

Things only really shifted after 1813 as Parliament forced the company to assert British sovereignty and more imperialist minded governors such as Wellesley at the turn of the century pushed the company onto a trajectory of aggressive growth by conquest that the company's directors didn't really want. The company slowly and surreptitiously began to drop their references to Mughal sovereignty though it did have a destabilizing effect for them. This tension over the sovereignty of the empire was one of the major strains of conflict in the great uprising of 1857. And while the event was largely recast by the British as Indians rebelling against them, historians in the 20th century have pointed out that while that was defacto true, in a dejure sense the British were technically the rebels against Mughal suzerainty. 

Another fun fact, the British refusing to pay what was owed to the emperor created a legal dispute that Akbar Shah actually won as a technical matter. He had dispatched Raja Rammohan Roy to England to argue his case and Parliament was infact forced to acknowledge that the Emperor's case was valid and ordered the company to pay the emperor what he was owed. They just chose to not really enforce the order and Roy died soon after in London and so couldn't press the matter especially with Parliament soon ending the Company's commercial interests in 1833.

The point of all of this is to really say that there was infact this *thing* that the British called the ""Empire of India"" which everyone sort of operated in. It's not quite a country but it was a sort of shared political sandbox and gaining formal legitimacy within that imperial frame was important even if the emperor's power was purely symbolic. But symbolic power can still be important in the study of history and politics. Even after 1857 the British couldn't really escape that imperial construct and ended up recreating it by making Victoria it's empress. And the need to respect the systems and demands of that imperial system and needing to operate as a subordinate within it, even if only in a symbolic capacity has had a pretty profound impact on the underlying legal structures that would shape South Asian law and the unified political entity that was British India.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhaVNWTl94MG1XOEJEeGpLS0E2TVBrTEE0dXdaaDVtczV2UThGVHU4MUpoSFlSME1mdHhCZ0FuZktYVEgyWjl2dVhwbHVJcXFoM2NQTk5ic1BKcTUxZmJYSGF2Z3RiUXlyRDFXbENYQXgtNWc9

"I genuinely don't know what you're talking about here. India became independent in 1947, alongside Pakistan. India did retain the British monarchy initially, but as a purely symbolic arrangement (much like Canada today) and even that was done away with in 1950. The British administration left in 1947, and India pretty quickly started doing things the UK didn't agree with, like the invasion of Hyderabad. They had full control over their affairs.

"Very well written! Quick question though. Wasn't East India Company already in charge of most of India by 1857? I remember reading about all the wars they had with regional rulers (eg. Can't remember the king's name but when he was eventually killed in action, the general of the British side personally came to the battlefield to see his dead body). 

The reason I ask above is because of your comment ""This tension over the sovereignty of the empire was one of the major strains of conflict in the great uprising of 1857."". I thought by 1857, India understood that the British were here to stay and should've understood that they'll eventually take over the whole country.

"The British did formally rule over most of the subcontinent by 1857, but the complex system of sovereign authority and symbolism was deeply embedded into the structures of power. And in shaking that system, the British contributed to the rising of 1857 and the way it played out.

Before I explain further, I think its important to clarify something major here. Which is this idea that Indians understood the British were ""here to stay."" That comment, and the underlying assumption of Indians seeing themselves as insiders and the British as outsiders is grounded in a vision of ""united Indians"" and ""foreign British"" that was in many ways a construct of the late 19th and early 20th century. Having forged a united country, the British were left with the consequence of people actually starting to believe in the joint identity. The national movement of the 20th century played a major role in deepening this dichotomy too. But for the most part that sense of a singular national identity didn't exist in the 18th and early 19th century. People saw the British as simply one more force in their world. Not necessarily as inherent outsiders.

But coming back to symbolism. The system of claims that British power was built on allowed them to keep Indian elites conciliated. Vast portions of India were under British authority, but its worth remembering that the number of Britons in India was always small. For the Raj to work, the British needed the local aristocracy and upper caste communities to also accept their rule. The vast majority of their army consisted of Indian troops, most of whom were recruited from upper caste and upper class Muslim and Hindu peasant communities. Communities that needed to be reassured that the British were legitimate rulers as any ruler needed to reassure them.

The other factor in this are the native princes and the local aristocrats (Essentially groups such as the various talukhdars and zamindars throughout India). These groups similarly had to be constantly conciliated. And the way the British did this was by notionally demonstrating their enmeshment into the lines of symbolic power, rather than imposing themselves as conquerors.

By 1857 this was in crisis. The British had been busy alienating both their sepoys and the native princes through controversies over pay, policies such as the doctrine of lapse, and the anglicization of government. The growing feeling among the landed elite was this sense that the British no longer adhered to the ""ancient customs"" by which they had lived. Remember this sort of thinking was not just about feeling hurt over sentiment. The idea of customary practice was one that had legal force. In many ways British actions were akin to a modern government trampling long held constitutional rights. A deeply antagonistic thing for people.

We see controversies in 1857 emerge out of these feelings, such as the widespread rumor that the British were going to make Muslim and Hindu soldiers ""lose caste"" by having them bite the Enfield bullet cartridges supposedly made of pork and beef. These rumors grew out of this sense of alienation.

When the Great Revolt broke out, sepoys and aristocrats converged on the traditional symbolic powers of the subcontinent. Bahadur Shah Zafar in Delhi, Nana Saheb, the legal Peshaw in Kanpur, the various clan princes such as in Gwalior (the seat of the Shinde clan, though the Shinde royals ultimately sided with the British having to run from their own troops who were acclaiming them), even Lakshmibai's battles are a manifestation of this. All of these groups had been demanding a restoration of their traditional rights and privileges. Which the British had been undermining as they asserted their own sovereignty over the more traditional lines of power.

The British would claim these acts rebellious. British historiography would write of Bahadur Shah's proclamation as Emperor. But nobody was proclaiming him Emperor. He was already Emperor. It wasn't until the 1930s that people started going ""well technically the British were the rebels you know.""

The fact that the EIC was de-facto in charge of the country doesn't take away from the fact that these equations and claims of symbolic power were important. Even though the Uprising was quelled, the British realized they had gone too far in uprooting traditional systems of power. Post 1857 there was a concentrated restoration of native authority, the autonomy of native princes such as the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Rajas of Gwalior actually increased somewhat. 

The British also eventually realized they'd need to do more, hence why the British began investing heavily in trying to promote a veneration of the monarchy. Indian princes were inculcated into British symbolic recognition through the Star of India and later the Order of the British Empire. Victoria was proclaimed Empress. The British would hold grand Durbars, evoking the old forms of Mughal power, invest in magnificent architectural projects (see the High Court buildings, the vice-regal palaces, later things such as Victoria Memorial and finally New Delhi). Building grand structures was a particularly traditional way of establishing legitimacy in India, going back to the establishment of great temples, grand mosques and lavish tombs such as the Taj Mahal, the Jama Masjids in various cities, or the great temples in the South.

You can even see the eventual relocation of the capital to Delhi as a manifestation of this policy of keeping the Indian elite conciliated. And the consequences of these systems of legitimacy, sovereignty and conciliation have shaped Indian laws and ideas of politics at a deeply fundamental level even today.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZhV0dpN0ZoU1FoVG9QWHN6cVBmbmhDWEx4YUJRQk9Mb1M0MlZETXBlTkwyQ0VKSGd0OXpGS1FiTlh4YzNvaEpJRzNrbkNjLWsxVnJIQS1wa2lJWHRfUFpsYkxCdUNmdGVhcnRuVHhOR3RMTFk9

Another question since you have an in-depth understanding is the issues here. I see a lot of Pakistan's current problems relating to the landlords in Pakistan having a lot of power (excluding the army bs). Did these chaudaries and thakurs gain all of this land and power after 1857 because the British wanted to give some of the power back to Indians to quell some of the resentment that was brewing within the population?,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZibXRPYjE4V05xT3NkdW5tRG9uZTZmRXNLV0c4T1dEWkZBak1EYlBoNlBUY2F5RmhYTGQwZmliVURUSHRVcnVOS3h3aTVlYnl1a3U2NFVpUXVwMFE4QVE9PQ==
"So the history of landlords in Pakistan is a tad complicated. 1857 certainly played a small role in the reorganization of holdings there. But both Sindh and Punjab had been relatively recently conquered when the Great Revolt happened. As a result, because the region was under much heavier military occupation, the uprising wasn't particularly widespread there. It is where the myth of a ""loyal Punjab"" came from. Sindh similarly didn't see too much pressure.

What that meant was that landlords weren't actively displaced in the same numbers as they were in places such as modern day UP and Bihar in India.

But many land holders in Pakistan nonetheless gained their domains later in the 19th century. The British played a major role in redistributing land there. For instance with the Canal Colonies in Punjab saw significant land tenure expansions, and entire communities being established. Further because the British liked to recruit from peasant communities, and because Punjab and to an extent Sindh became favored recruiting grounds for the Army after 1857 till about 1914, there was also a lot of enmeshment between the major landholders and the military. This meant that the British were somewhat invested in making sure communities that they favored as ""martial races"" had access to territory so that there was adequate recruitment for the military.

You'll notice I haven't spoken much about the NWFP and Balochistan. And that's because I'm just not as familiar with those regions. They were brought under British rule even later than Sindh and Punjab for the most part, and its outside my area of expertise. So I don't want to offer comments on what was going on there vis landlords in relation to the mid-19th century upheavals",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZicGdRNUhDWmVjZXA5YkxVYnYyaElmR0ttR2V4eHFyOTl4S09OTURObE5qWWdPNkJkWFNkd21EaGRVWnBqVFhzUnVQNmc4MmF3UW4zRjE0LUwtQ1VfVHlxU1hTWkg1dFAzWllGWEdEWnJRXzA9

"Hawke is perhaps most famous for colliding with Titanic's twin sister, Olympic, in September 1911. 

The two ships were on parallel tracks in the Solent when the Hawke suddenly turned towards Olympic. Hawke was unable to stop and her armoured bow crashed into the side of Olympic causing serious damage to the liner but no injuries. Hawke suffered major damage with her bow crushed, and could have been lost, but she was able to make it to port.

Olympic returned to Southampton to offload passengers and make emergency repairs but she had to return to her makers at Harland and Wolff in Belfast for drydocking and the replacement of a propellor shaft. Crews who were busy completing her sister ship were diverted to fixing Olympic which meant there were delays to the completion of Titanic. Six weeks of repairs  created massive costs for White Star who were already spending heavily on the three new super liners and had to find replacement vessels to fill their service. Ironically, the fact Olympic survived the collision and flooding of two of her compartments only increased public perceptions that these giant new ships were entirely safe.

The Royal Navy blamed Olympic for the accident which was held up by the Court of Inquiry, blaming the enormous displacement of water around the liner for drawing in the much smaller warship.

"\\- India in 1700 had a larger GDP than all of Europe combined

Measuring historical GDP is notoriously tricky, but this is almost certainly false. Using the figures I can find, it seems like it was only slightly larger than western Europe, so including eastern and south-eastern Europe, India's economy would have been smaller. I have a hunch that whoever came up with this fact just ignored the Ottoman and Russian Empires because they're mostly Asian powers, even though they had large holdings in Europe at that time.

&#x200B;

\\- by 1947 India's share had dropped to 3% and it's people were left impoverished

Very cleverly worded to make you think that India's economy had gone down in the intervening years. In fact, India's GDP overall rose significantly during that period. The ***percentage*** of world GDP dropped because Europe and North America saw an explosion in population and production.

 It's like saying America's share of world GDP has dropped since the 1950s because China has been looting the American economy with unfair trade deals. China's trade policies aside, the American economy hasn't gone down, it's just that formerly impoverished countries like China, Korea - and even India to an extent - have seen a massive increase in wealth.

&#x200B;

\\- During this period of disorder, the British sensed opportunity

The British couldn't have cared less about conquering India during the mid 18th century. Much like the Conquistadors, the men who set up Britain's early territorial gains in India weren't operating under orders from home, and sometimes completely in the face of them. Robert Clive didn't have the full support of his superiors in the East India Company, never mind the government in London. Armies are expensive and the profit-minded company men always grumbled about the cost. It's really ridiculous once you know a bit about the history of the British Raj just how close it came to never happening because all they really wanted to do was buy tea. 

Then once Clive had secured Bengal and they realized there was something there worth defending, the government in London started to take an interest. But even then, most of the wars were reactive, trying to defend what they'd already taken from ambitious Indian princes and the French. Especially the French, who were a lot more interested in playing the game and somehow a lot worse at it.

&#x200B;

\\- India's native institutions were demolished

Almost half of the Raj was made up of autonomous states governed by native princes; the British dictated their external affairs, but otherwise they could rule themselves (although many leaned heavily on the British for support). And ironically the video uses a picture of a temple to illustrate the point, when India's Hindu temples flourished during the Raj. In fact India's native institutions were far more stable during British rule than they had been under the Mughals, due to both the disorder of the final decades of Mughal power and the very anti-Hindu policies of many emperors.

"> historians believe the ship’s magazine, where ammunition was stored, exploded. 

From  *The Cruel Sea* by Nicholas Monsarrat which covers the North Atlantic war, IIRC, the biggest damage is when the boiler explodes on contact with cold seawater. 

I have no other background on the subject, but adding these two explosions, its surprising the hull is intact.

At a guess, the otherwise good condition of the hull would be helped by  the cold Northern latitude combined with the sea depth.

"Can anyone confirm a fact I once heard. It stated that the reason we call Fuchsia ""Fuchsia"" is because it was named after the Tyrian dye sold by ancient Phoenicia, and thus was named after Phoenicia.

When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started.

Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer.

- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team.

Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)

"I was reading the [Wikipedia page on the Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death#Lack_of_hygiene) and under causes/Lack of hygiene it says

> Early Christians considered bathing a temptation. With this danger in mind, [St. Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_of_Nursia) declared, ""To those who are well, and especially to the young, bathing shall seldom be permitted."" [St. Agnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Rome) took the injunction to heart and died without ever bathing

Only problem is that St Benny wrote his injunction in the 6th century, while the linked St Agnes died in the 4th century. So I'd like to correct the page - but the cited source (*Kelly, John (2006). The Great Mortality: An Intimate History of the Black Death, the Most Devastating Plague of All Time.*) just has the word-for-word text from the wiki article. It cites *Edward Gibbon in McLaughlin, Coprophilia* but I can't get a copy of this.

None of the other [St Agnes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Agnes_(disambiguation\\)) mention not bathing. This [forum thread](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/why-the-hell-did-people-in-the-old-times-not-bathe.821161/post-4587424) from AnandTech says it wasn't even a St Agnes, it was the unsainted Agnes of Poitou but I can't find any evidence for this.

"Hi!  
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

"Where to start?

Hello all, 

Recently I have been wanting to learn more about history and important events that has shaped our society and the world we live in today. I have realized that I have heard about alot of historical events and persons but I dont really know why they occured, exactly when it was, what the persons roles where etc (e.g. The french revolution, spanish inquisition, american civil war, napoleon bonaparte, Charles XII/Carolus rex etc.)

I really want to learn more but dont really know where to start or what books/litterature that are worth reading. (I am also interrested in tips about movies, documentaries etc). Im swedish so litterature in english or swedish are prefered.Tips about famous classic litterature such as dostojevski etc are also appreciated. Thanks in advance!",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGZ4elJmSWN3eG83b2tjYnBVd2RldmpSMnB2dF82dE4tTm1zLU9EcW05eDVYazUzOFR4NlVaYk9EZTlPOEpJNVpxb28zbklGYzQwTGU4TzIwUEswMHV4U3c9PQ==

"The guy who came up with Stockholm syndrome is Nils Bejerot, he's also very infamous for being the father of Swedish drug policies. 

He envisioned drug addiction as a disease. People take drugs, and become diseased with addiction. Then they spread the addiction to people around them, and it keeps going until it spreads throughout the country. The thing with his approach is therefore that the fault of drug use spreading and drug addiction is not dealers but users. Drug users are at fault for drug addiction becoming a societal problem and they must be quarantined. This is done by prosecuting them, and eventually incarcerating/institutionalising them. By cutting off drug users from society he figured drug use would stop spreading. 

His reasoning was that people don't naturally know that you can inject substances to get high, someone must have first told them and taught how to do it. 

Among western countries Sweden is unique because Sweden incriminates drug use, while most other countries only do possession. You can be prosecuted here for failing a drug test. As a result Swedish police spend a lot of time chasing drug users and making people do drug tests.

Bejerot is pretty influential while also being relatively unknown today.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0eGNtd0VmZjQ5SFRoaWZOVDIyRDVtNVdnR2VPVUx0T3VrWlptYUU1R3VwR3dJQ0paZmFSNGdMd1hjMmN2aWJ1SjhXYUlRakVUbFFId2c4aFc0d2poQVE9PQ==

"From the article:

**For some, this theorising was an attempt to deflect attention away from the mistakes made by him and police colleagues during the siege, by instead putting the blame on victims.  
Over the course of the siege, the four hostages and two criminals began to develop an unlikely bond inside the bank vault, amid apparent acts of kindness by the captors. In contrast, the captives expressed more hostility towards the police, fearing that any attempt to end the stand-off might end in them being killed.**

I’ve always thought this psycho analysis was contrived. The police wanted to go in and shoot the criminals and based on the phone calls the hostages overheard, they felt like they would die in the crossfire and that the police didn’t value their lives as much as they valued stopping the robbery.

The police were being nitwits and the hostages were trying to stay alive while the police force made it clear that wasn’t their main priority. 

I feel for the hostages here just trying to stay alive and then the police creating some psychology buzz term to get public support for “whoops maybe we killed a hostage but they turned into criminals themselves so it’s ok”",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY0UkZoa3lmTmd2aWk3WUxzU1hiUWRmVWNaR3ludFhiWURyYTJFRHk5aU1qMTBtdnRyVDhTTFoyTUMtVWIyUGdMTU5RaHJ1OEdpemNicWNlYjhlNjdLSUE9PQ==

Medical marijuana isn't much of a thing in Sweden. There are two drugs that use THC as an ingredient but marijuana itself isn't medicine here so I guess thechnically there is no justification for why one person would have it with them. 

Cocaine is an anesthetic so it has medicinal use, which is probably why it's in the medical use category.

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion & Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Simple/Short/Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

"The English Civil War and the Fronde.  I am curious about these two events. They happened roughly in the same time span, yet they had drastically different results. The English civil war resulted in a military dictatorship followed by the re-establishment of the monarchy, but ultimately strengthened Parliament and set the stage for modern British politics. The Fronde, on the other hand, simply confirmed the “divine rights” of kings in France. Is it fair to compare these two events as though they are mirrored of each other?

"This stuff always confuses me.  Not that I am saying anyone is wrong, hell I can just about ask a reasonable question on this subject.  My understanding is that in the Montana area the cultures went like this  

  
**Clovis Culture**: Present around 13,050 to 12,750 years ago, the Clovis people are known for their distinctive fluted projectile points used for hunting large game like mammoths. The Anzick site in Montana is a significant Clovis archaeological site.

1. **Folsom Culture**: Following the Clovis culture, the Folsom people were present around 12,800 to 11,500 years ago. They are known for their smaller, more refined fluted projectile points.
2. **Plano Cultures**: These cultures existed from about 11,000 to 7,000 years ago and are characterized by their unfluted projectile points. The Plano cultures were widespread across the Great Plains, including Montana.
3. **Cody Complex**: This culture, dating from around 10,000 to 8,000 years ago, is known for its Cody knives and Eden points. The Cody Complex people were highly skilled bison hunters.
4. **Archaic Period Cultures**: Spanning from about 8,000 to 2,000 years ago, these cultures adapted to changing environments and resources. They developed a variety of tools and hunting strategies, including the use of atlatls (spear-throwers).
5. **Late Prehistoric Period**: This period, from about 2,000 years ago to the arrival of Europeans, saw the development of more complex societies and technologies, including the bow and arrow. The ancestors of many modern Native American tribes, such as the Blackfeet and Crow, lived in Montana during this time.

So how do I fit this in?  I get the Blackfeet are stating they have been around longer then #5 claims, but what about the other cultures?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2a0MtRm1ubEhrang5MUVNUGpsUFFSZFdoemlSX0gzeDVDVC1TZkU4SWd5RHQxVFNwYnBUV1ZNSGdweTFJQkZNcFhkcFB0akdlT0ZEVERaWkV5ejBGUHZjckMtS1FDWEI4cVBYalAzd3o5UUU9

"It's a bit difficult to give definitive answers here because the concept of slavery was much larger and more detailed than we think of in our modern (presumably) western minds. There wasn't just one type of slave, there wasn't just one type of slavery, and multiple different types of both could exist within one part of Greece and then we need to remember as well that these were mostly all independent places with their own laws, customs, etc. Additionally, while some slaves could be owned by the ""state"" (to use a term carefully) they could also be privately owned. What one owner does and and another does is often going to be different. So slavery wasn't practiced the same way everywhere. But for simplicities sake I'll continue to use the term ""slave"" as a catchall. 

There are depictions in the iconography which show slaves with beards. But the problem with iconography is that it may not always reflect actual practices, and sometimes we can only hypothesise that someone is a slave, and unless they've written something next to them to definitely say they are it can be difficult. 

But you're right that hair was a very important cultural and social marker. It was not only used to show positive things, but also negative things. Women in particular were often ""marked"" for adultery, or prostitution, in this way. So you would definitely see slaves having their hair shorn, but it wouldn't have been every slave, in every place.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY2UVdSaHB0R0l0ZEFmTHdNMmlGaVV1Q25GZER3OGxPZUEySGVSb21kXzhSUWwtZkdORXhTODR6MmtpS0JOYnIzZGJGUXlybkN6TnFvVFhjb09NOXJWN0E9PQ==
"Folsom, Plano, Clovis etc are all culture designations, it's a way for archeologists and anthropologists to create broad groups for material evidence that we find. Many times we don't even have human bones at these sites; it's edged weapons, animal bones, or burnt seeds. These cultures often overlapped and shared their technology, so even these Culture designations can be fluid and subjective. We often don't know who occupied these sites, they don't correspond to modern tribes. For the few sites where there are human bones, scientists are slowly sampling and sequencing where it's possible. This is complicated by indigenous people's beliefs around their ancestors remains, and American and Canadian laws that protect those beliefs/remains. In the paper mentioned above, the researchers were able to use previously sequenced DNA from ancient Native Americans and compare it to 6 modern people from the Blackfoot tribe. They found that the Blackfoot people have been in the area a very long time. The tribe also seems to have been isolated for a long time, as there was admixture ( they specifically mention the Cree people) but that admixture happened recently. I assume most mixing happened after the Trail of Tears when several tribes were shoved together and marched west into the Great Plains.

"Probably not. Humans have been around a long time, and much has changed in that time to explain plenty of our myths if they are anything more than that. Gigantopithecus went extinct during the Pleistocene, some 200,000 years ago, which may explain the oral traditions of large apes like Bigfoot or Yetis, but even anthropologists r divided on that. Its somewhat unlikely that our oral histories would go back a million years, much less the 9 million years and a dozen different species for anything to remain from our ancestoes in Nakalipithecus or whatever contemporary ape is our actual ancestor.

But the fact that oral histories can go back tens of thousands is super cool, and one that is not talked about enough.

"I think it is fairly unlikely that we have oral history from before the development of language, but there might be some instincutal norms baked into our myths somehow. It is just hard to say that something like the fear of fire is a cultural thing that is passed down, rather it seems to be learned behavior in most things that encounter it. Specific knowledge like that tends to be taught.

I just sort of doubt that Chimps and Apes both lost the ability to speak over time. I think it is much more likely that our ancestors developed it after the split. I know that is probably not what you were saying, but without a continuous oral history most of what we could glean from ancestors would be things that we would learn almost immediately on our own without that.

Language probably did arise sometime between 200,000 and 2,000,000 years ago though, so that it a LOT of time basic oral concepts might have been transfered.

I’m tired as shit right now waiting for my sister to get home so my baby sitting uncle duties are over and I can sleep but the short version is that many tribes knowledge was highly compartmentalized among a very few people and that when the European diseases hit those people died and the tribe lost almost all of their mythology.

If I was born in a place and all my living relatives have always lived there when I'm born, am I native, or does it not count because hundreds of years ago a different group of people lived here and were pushed out/left? Do you need to have a cultural base/civilization established somewhere for a certain period of time such as 1000 years before you can claim native status? This then gets into, in my opinion, uncomfortable racial purity arguments.

""Non-zero chance""... Sure!

But I see absolutely no good reason to believe that something like the flood myth would be several millions years old.

It *could* be a very old myth, based on a real event - a couple of decent candidates would be the Black Sea flood (around 5600 BCE) or perhaps even the Toba explosion and the tsunami that followed (around 75000 BCE if I remember correctly).

"The Cerutti Mastodon Site is not very well liked among most archeologists and anthropologists because its incredibly circumstantial evidence with potential explanations that are much more recent (ie, road traffic damaging the bones). There's nothing else apart from the prospect of the bones being smashed that points towards human presence, there's nothing like a sign of human habitation like trash, tools, human bones or even the use of nearby stone that should be useful for making tools. Nothing else even close to this old has ever been found anywhere in the either continent and already the Cerutti Mastodon Site is working off extremely ambiguous evidence at best.

Its also worth mentioning that based on our current understanding of human genetics and the movement of anatomically modern humans even if this is shown at some point to have been some kind of human presence in America based on the site it almost certainly has absolutely no connection to Modern Native Americans, who came from Asia in waves of migration much more recently, its most likely its an entirely different species of human.

"But there are some reasons to believe the Sahara was settled for a long time as well(Green Sahara with rivers and inland seas and lakes, but no excavations yet, due to the isolated locations), so the story could come from this part of prehistory, just like the flood myths.

I would not be surprised if we find 6000-12000 year  old (chalco)lithic settlements in the Sahara(Holocene era, African humid period), and that their desertion due to desertification led to ancient Egypt getting an impulse of population and skills that accelerated their advancement compared to other cultures in the region.

"There's a story about getting kicked out from a beautiful garden for some transgression and a large number of people that had to leave their green pastures when the lakes dried out, the animals left and the greenery dissapeared.

After a few thousand years, the descendants of those people might retell the story as being kicked out of paradise.

But yes, it could easily come from a different (desertification?) event. The lands where the story seems to originate from (Sumeria, so modern Iraq) used to look very different from what they look now, so maybe it was about that. There are drawings depicting all sorts of animals that can only be found in Zoos in that region and it was significantly greener. The ancestors of the Sumerians migrated to Europe (to become the EEFs), maybe they did so when the area changed significantly from something closer to ""paradise"". The ones that stayed and built those cities, probably had a good reason to write stories about the good old days before they had to migrate when their homes turned into a desert.

">Why? 

**30,000 years**.

We can't even know for sure that this story is based on a real event, it's just more interesting if that's the case so we're trying to go with it and give it the benefit of the doubt.

I can do that for up to 3000 years... not much longer.

>We know from evidence people have been in the area that long, and people can pass down information orally.

But do we know those same people had a continuous culture and stayed within that area for the entire 30,000 years? How did you rule out that within the 30,000 year span of history they never could have come into contact with other cultures with stories of more recent volcanic explosions?

Is it more logical that this group stayed in the same place spreading their oral tradition for 30,000 years or that they spread it for 5000 years based on a story they heard from a chance encounter with a tribe who fled from some different explosion?

30,000 years. We're no longer talking on the scales of stories being changed generation to generation, but entire languages themselves. 

>Aboriginal Australians have the oldest continuous culture in the world.

Cultures intermingle, evolve and change. Sure there's a ""continuity"" in the same sense there's a continuity between homo sapiens and H. heidelbergensis. But they're different species. That's a long time for that ""continuity"" to really be thought of as ""they're the same culture"". (For record, Homo Erectus went extinct just over 3 oral traditions lengths ago, around 108,000 years ago). 

How can we prove a ""continuous culture"" on the scale of 30,000 years? If archaeology has a gap of even 50 years unaccounted for in that 30,000 year gap... a lot of things could have happened.

>Humans can be quite good at accurately passing down oral information when they want to.

I'm well aware. I have Irish ancestry and our oral tradition is so remarkably preserved that when compared with **hundreds** of years old documents many stories are accurate to the word.

>This might seem crazy to us, because our culture has passed down information via writing for so long, but it really isn’t.

Oral tradition for a long period of time doesn't seem crazy to me. It is the claim of 30,000 years that is honestly not even worth entertaining as a possibility. If that doesn't seem as obvious to you as me, I guess I don't really have much of a better way to explain it, but you do realize that this is at this point pure speculation right?

Like your speculation on what's likely over a 30,000 year period versus mine? I feel like a lot of unknowns start coming in over that time that should be shaking your confidence in your speculation a little bit.

I was willing to entertain the idea over 3000 years. 30,000 is just way too long.

>Especially if the story is general concept (mountain exploding) Details can shift and change and the core of the story can still be about the last volcanic eruption.

I understand what we're talking about.

I'm not even arguing with this point. I'm saying it's more likely, even if the story IS true and about a real volcanic eruption, that it makes way more sense to be about the volcanic eruption that happened in Australia 5000 years ago and people moved than it was about the one 30,000 years ago and no one moved.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY4Y3dLUTZmN2VxdTVjVl9DaEthNUFlZy11Yk1ZbmtnRjJqeVp6UDhaV3dKWVpaa1J3eDBuZF9rMmpJVjhvTENSWEFJZkg1RUpDNmczemhnZUgxQ3BNdXc9PQ==

"The oral histories passed down by the [Hadza people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadza_people) in Africa are mind boggling:

>One telling of Hadza's oral history divides their past into four epochs, each inhabited by a different culture. According to this tradition, at the beginning of time, the world was inhabited by hairy giants called the akakaanebee (first ones) or geranebee (ancient ones). The akakaanebee did not possess tools or fire; they hunted game by running it down until it fell dead; they ate meat raw. They did not build houses but slept under trees, as the Hadza do today in the dry season. In older versions of this story, they did not use fire because it was physically impossible in the earth's primeval state. Younger Hadza, who have been to school, say that the akakaanebee did not know how to use fire.

>In the second epoch, the akakaanebee were succeeded by the xhaaxhaanebee (in-between ones), who were equally gigantic but without hair. Fire could be made and used to cook meat, but animals had grown more wary of humans and had to be chased and hunted by dogs. The xhaaxhaanebee were the first people to use medicines and charms to protect themselves from enemies and initiated the epeme rite. They lived in caves.

>The third epoch was inhabited by the people of hamakwanebee (recent days), who were smaller than their predecessors. They invented bows and arrows, cooked with containers, and mastered the use of fire. They also built huts like those of Hadza today. The people of hamakwanebee were the first of the Hadza ancestors to have contact with non-foraging people, with whom they traded for iron to make knives and arrowheads. They also invented the gambling game lukuchuko.

>The fourth epoch continues today and is inhabited by the hamayishonebee (those of today). When discussing the hamayishonebee epoch, people often mention specific names and places and can say approximately how many generations ago events occurred.

This is highly intriguing when you consider this critical piece of information:

>Hadzaland is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Olduvai Gorge, an area sometimes called the ""Cradle of Mankind"" because of the number of hominin fossils found there, and 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the prehistoric site of Laetoli.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGY5ajBXVGdqdjdGX1p4VFozQmwydE0yZGZGMkZxOVd6dTJyQjdGaE5qbWFNRFQ1UDdiM195d1FNaGhvUzd6dHhXcG5WOGxKaWRXRGxuMWF6VTBoVkhSZHc9PQ==

While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. Below you'll find a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

"This makes no sense. From the link ""In the time of slavery in Colombia, hair braiding was used to relay messages. For example, to signal that they wanted to escape, women would braid a hairstyle called departes. “It had thick, tight braids, braided closely to the scalp and was tied into buns on the top,” Asprilla Garcia says. [...] “And another style had curved braids, tightly braided on their heads. The curved braids would represent the roads they would [use to] escape,” Asprilla Garcia says. “In the braids, they also kept gold and hid seeds which, in the long run, helped them survive after they escaped.”""

Who are they signaling that they want to escape? Were there people hanging around waiting to help slaves escape who would notice their hair?

How does the braider know so much about how to escape, yet they have not escaped themselves? How helpful can a cornrow map possibly be? As the link says there were communities of escaped slaves in remote areas, why not just tell the person making the break where to go?

Cornrows take hours to braid, did Columbian slaves really have that much free time? How dumb were the owners that they didn't notice slaves getting a new hairstyle and then escaping shortly after?

Where were the slaves getting gold to hide in their hair? Why would they need to smuggle seeds? Didn't they have bags?

"The Military Service Act (1916) imposed conscription on all single men aged 18-41 with exemptions for medically unfit, clergymen, teachers and certain classes of industrial worker. Conscientious Objectors were also exempted but did end up doing some kind of service in either civilian jobs or non-combatant role. The act was later expanded to include married men. 

The approximate British male population between 18 and 41 was 2,540,000. For a quick check, I can't get more specific than that as the age groups bands didn't perfectly line up: 15-19 years old and then 20-24. So the 18 years old weren't included nor were the ages 40 and 41. [Source](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5e8f3bda86650c2dd8151c28/population-data-tables.xlsx)

"All of it sounds reasonable enough.  It just depends on how restricted they were and how they managed to circumvent those restrictions.  How limited was conversation?  How easy was it to organize groups?  If a few key forks of a route could be mapped out in a pattern, that's a map available to any number of people at just a glance without speaking, without a physical object that is obvious contraband.  Same with seeds and bags.  Also, working with detainees and refugees, lots of coping details get lost in the trauma.  The communication methods are passed down out of necessity to people that need to know in the moment, but the details are lost as the need is lost.  As for the slave owners being stupid, yes they were, but most people would not be able to recognize a change in a person's appearance as some form of secretive signaling.  Consider how skeptical you are even now having heard stories of maps in cornrows, imagine how likely you would have been to suspect that was happening when not knowing about it at all.

"As an engineer, I can partially answer this.

First, a lot (though not all) of engineering efforts become simpler if you have enough resources, in terms of material, time, money and so on. If you value stability and endurance more than cost efficiency, things get a bit easier. 

Also, some requirements were simply less challenging. If you want to build a road now, you have to take into account the weights of cars, semi trucks and other heavy vehicles. In ancient times, loaded horse carriages were probably  the heaviest ""vehicles"". Less weight and less ""traffic"" (not everybody had a carriage) means less load on the road. Another example is given by skyscrapers. Nowadays, skyscrapers and very tall buildings are pretty common for many reasons, including high population density. Most ancient buildings are not that tall. The Colosseum in Rome, one of the most famous ancient buildings, is only 160 ft tall, which is not that much by modern standards.

The most challenging requirement in many cases was endurance. Like, this thing should last a century, or 1000 years or more. With some exceptions (like columns), large things survive better. With columns and pillars you have to be careful, because columns can crumble under their own weight, but this was already known to the Romans and probably other civilizations. You don't need advanced math for this. Run some tests, notice a pattern, measure the ratio between width amd height and write that down.

Finally, there's an obvious survivorship bias. What we see is what survived to these years. Most people lived in houses that have been destroyed by the times (and by humans). 

Hope this helps.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdHTTE1a0U4TlJHRTNNRDFZbG1SQW92NThCUkl5d2RKVjA0M1RpMnlUT1M3aUZObEY1UlNyc0k4RjlhX1NuakFUZl9nVG5iZVlOZ3k0UjhTc2JITEc5VlE9PQ==

"I recall poison was traditionally used by indigenous African hunters when hunting elephants and rhinos. The Liangulu people of Kenya augmented poisoned arrows with powerful longbows able to penetrate the hides of these animals, reported killing thousands of elephants each year this way for the ivory trade well into the 1950s. 

Firearms have been common in Subsaharan Africa since the 1600s, when tens of thousands of European-made firearms flowed into the region to fuel the Atlantic slave trade.

"Yep, for most of us. Anthropologists’ most recent research and DNA analysis shows that Homosapiens came out of Africa about 200 millennia ago and emigrated to Eurasia. There they coexisted with the native Neanderthal population for 30 or 40 millennia, slowly subsuming them through a combination of conquest, forced tribute, enslavement, and even voluntary intermarriage. But the smaller, more intelligent Homosapiens won out over the long term, with modern Eurasians (and their descendants in Polynesia and the new world) having only 1 or 2% Neanderthal DNA. 

But that’s not the case with people native to Africa. A quickly drying climate (due to changing ocean currents from the closing of the isthmus of Panama around this time) led to the rapid deforestation and desertification of central Africa, effectively cutting off sub-Saharan Africa from migration of those with Neanderthal DNA from Eurasia. So Africans today are more highly evolved and more “human” than anyone else on Earth.

Then you have a few of your most athletic guys break off and draw aggro, while the larger group stays back, using it’s size in numbers to redirect if needed, or keep back another large animal if it’s not alone. 

Once it’s tired out, or sufficiently fucking irritated and confused by these annoying ass homo sapiens, it chases one into the pike trap that the runner dodges. That’s when the rest of the group pops out of hiding and absolutely fucking shishkebabs the animal.

"We are always looking to find new answers, it's a requirement of the field. We conduct what's called ""original research"" throughout our careers, it's a requirement to even get a PhD -- and sometimes an MA. 

Original research should be something that no one has done before, but it usually isn't like ""hey I discovered a country no one knew existed"" but smaller in scope like ""this vase type may have been made by a similar artist that worked in this other area as evident by the use of a specific stroke that no one noticed before"" 

I wouldn't say there's anything as big as consciousness, but certainly large areas of debate. Because we are constantly publishing new ideas, and new original research, we may run into conflict -- and usually do -- with someone else's hypothesis. They might look at that vase type that one person argued was a similar artist and say it's actually proof of a brand new unidentified artist because it looks like the stroke was done by a left hand, while the other one was right. etc. Over time the left and right crowds will debate and eventually there will be some consensus for the most part. 

There's still some big quests like translating Linear A, finding Alexander the Great's tomb, etc. but it's a lot of small pieces of evidence, and small steps, and it takes a lot of time and for the most part never makes the news because it's quite boring to most people.

"Hide thickness can vary greatly depending on the area of the animal's body. An elephant's skin on its trunk, legs and back can get up to an inch thick, but the skin around the chest, abdomen, or shoulders is much thinner. 

A fellow name George Frison did some experimentation in the 1980s, where he tested the penetration of Clovis points fitted to atlatl darts on fresh African elephant carcasses that had been downed by local culling operations. The stone points he used were between 26-33 mm wide. In one test, three throws with the darts from 20 metres away managed to penetrate into the ribcage of an adult female elephant.

"Difficulty is that we have the tools they used.  Big, heavy projectile points are worthless against small game and extravagantly wasteful against medium sized things skinned game like deer.   There is a reason why they had them.

There are all kinds of ways you can hunt large, dangerous, and thick-skinned prey in relative safety, though dying on a hunt was probably a regular occurrence.

For example, you can attack from a position at a choke point or from elevated terrain where the animals can’t get to you.  I’ve seen this done by bow hunters going after African elephants.  

You could also panic them into stampeding, perhaps by setting a wildfire, and they might not even notice they’ve been hit initially just from the adrenaline, or if they do, might not have noticed their attacker, or judged that sticking around to stomp Thag Simpson for hurting them is a bad idea, risking being burnt to death.  Also remember this isn’t about individual hunters.  No one person can process an elephant, regardless of how shaggy it is.  It would have been a whole tribe effort.

Also, even thick skinned game like elephants can be effectively killed with primitive weaponry.  They kill differently than firearms, yes.  Firearms destroy tissue by crushing.  This is why the ability of a bullet to kill is dominated by 1/2mv^2.  Arrows, spears, and atlatl darts kill by cutting tissue, not crushing it.  You don’t need nearly as much energy.   

Plus you’re making assumptions about what an extinct animal will do based upon living species.  We know African elephants can be aggressive when attacked or disturbed, but African wildlife is like that because of all of the predators and aggressive herbivores.   Asian elephants can also be aggressive, but they are not as aggressive as their cousins on the dark continent.   We simply don’t know how mammoths and mastodons would have reacted.

Implicit in the argument you are making is that because *YOU* can’t imagine a way to hunt mammoths safely without modern firearms, our ancestors couldn’t either.  Also the assumption that they cared for their personal individual safety as much as First World modern technological humans do today.  I think both are facially invalid assumptions, and actually rather insulting. 

There is a kind of haughty derision behind your post, that because our ancestors had primitive technology that they weren’t as intelligent as we are today.

"We have tools yes. We have little-to-no evidence that tools were used in this fashion and it's not very physically plausible. Biologically, humans are slow to reproduce and pretty easy to break before surgery and antibiotics. Our ancestors almost certainly *did not* make a habit of fighting dangerous apex predators or extremely large and strong herbivores at 30 meters or less. 


Predators don't do that. Predators, even those running just on instinct and general memory, hunt easy and opportunistic prey. The absolute No.1 concern of a predator is avoiding injury, to the point they will retreat from fights they could easily win. Hunting the heavily built large herbivores is usually a desperation move. 


This also is not what groups of humans we have actual documentation of do. African tribes mostly left the highly dangerous herbivores alone, and when they did hunt, it's using poisons and traps and possibly stalking an isolated abandoned animal and trying to wear it down. Native Americans (excluding horses and bows) hunted bison with fire to spook them towards cliffs or other traps. Bears are universally a big deal in Native lore, and not something hunted lightly or regularly - and this is with bows having been developed ~ 1,400 years ago.

"Again, lack of imagination.   

First of all, they were probably using atlatls to throw their “spears” (actually, the terminology is “darts”).  We have atlatl weights from the time period, for example, and you need the extra leverage to throw a dart a significant distance.   The darts would have had a removable foreshaft with the projectile point because the points are relatively fragile and break easily on vigorous contact with a hard surface like a rock, and sometimes even bone.   Being able to easily replace the point on a dart or an arrow is why foreshafts are used.   

Atlatls also allow you quite a bit of extra range, more than you might imagine.   Current world record for the javelin is about 98.5 meters.  World record for an atlatl dart is 230.5 meters.   

I’m not suggesting that our ancestors shot at mammoths from 200+ yards, but it gives you an idea of the relative distance between throwing a spear and throwing an atlatl dart.   If you can throw a hunting spear 25 meters, you can probably do 60 meters with an equivalent dart.   And it’s not just one person.  You’ve got a group of men all launching darts at Manny the Mammoth.  Probably spread out fairly evenly, and if the mammoth goes after Thag, Ogg and Tumak and the boys are going to be attacking him from the sides.

All it takes is one dart to penetrate into the lungs to eventually kill the mammoth, and that’s a pretty big target.   

Yeah, modern technology allows a single individual to go up against an elephant with relatively little danger, but a group of individuals with primitive technology can also be effective.


BTW, have you ever made stone tools and projectile points?  I have.  I’m not good enough to make a Clovis or Folsom point, but I have made smaller pieces, and you wouldn’t believe how unbelievably sharp they are.  Far sharper than any steel blade.

"A favourite trope of those who decry the British impact on India is to glorify its previous Mughal Empire as a golden age of both economic prosperity and benevolent government.  Mughal India, we are told, accounted for roughly 25% of world GDP in 1700, before British rule, falling to a minuscule 5 per cent when the British left in 1947.  What that glib comparison overlooks is the fact that India in 1700 also had 25 per cent of the world’s population, meaning that its per capita GDP, the real measure of prosperity, was relatively low, due to its poor productivity as a largely agrarian economy on the eve of global industrialisation, which exponentially multiplied world GDP.

Indeed per capita income had been declining since 1600, when the Mughal Empire arguably peaked under its most illustrious emperor Akbar.  According to the Maddison Project, the major drop in India’s per capita GDP occurred between 1600 and 1750 and was stagnant thereafter till 1870.   In 1700, India’s per capita income was roughly half that of Britain’s at $729, compared with $1,540 for England.  It had fallen from $793 in 1600, showing a decline well before the break-up of the Mughal empire.  Per capita GDP fell further to $648 in 1800, just after the British took over, then went up to $673 in 1913, thanks to British India’s Raj-inspired industrial revolution, but dropped again to $619 in 1950 due to the world recession after WW1.

The reasons for India’s historically low productivity were manifold.  Textiles, India’s main export, were already declining in the 1700s, because its labour-intensive technology was unable to compete with Europe’s more technologically innovative handloom sector.  Underlying Mughal India’s technological stagnation was the fact that no agricultural surplus was being reinvested, because it was instead being creamed off by a rentier feudal class.  Because wages levels were low in India, producers preferred to increase output by hiring more workers rather than investing in new technology.

An estimated 80 per cent of the Mughal Empire was not administered directly but farmed out to feudal tax-collectors known as jagirdars.  In return for military service, jagirdars were only appointed for a few years at a time, with the result that their prime incentive was to extract as much from their districts as possible, as quickly as possible, with minimal long-term investment in new technology or irrigation.  The resulting decline in Mughal agricultural productivity pushed up both food and textile prices, thereby adding to the loss of foreign market share.  Although India now had to compete in rapidly expanding world markets due to the industrial revolution in Western Europe, Mughal India, unlike Europe, had neither autonomous cities nor a merchant class strong enough to offset these agrarian parasites.

At the peak of the Raj, the British rulers were a very thin layer at the top of society who took about 5% of national income. Their allies, the native princes and zamindars, took another 3%. 8% is a sizeable proportion for a ruling class to cream off, but, under the Mughal regime, the equivalent group had collected 15% of national income in taxes and spent most of it on their own consumption.  The leading historian of Mughal India, Irfan Habib concludes that not only was the Mughal Empire “its own grave-digger”, but “no new order was, or could be, created by the forces ranged against it…”

The political collapse of the Mughal Empire resulted in an even less economically conducive state of affairs. Though not literally anarchy, it was a disintegration into regional warlordism with predictable results.  The collapse of imperial authority resulted in what economic historians have identified as a period of deindustrialization much before the dominance of the East India Company.  
Imperial decline and constant internecine warfare reduced agricultural land acreage and productivity, which drove up food prices, then nominal wages and then textile prices, in an inflationary chain reaction which cost India textile market share in Britain even before the latter developed factory technology, wrongly blamed for that decline.

Between 1750 and 1810, the loss of Mughal hegemony allowed new despotic rulers to revenue farm their conquered populations, seeing tax and rent demands increase to as much as 50 per cent of production (compared to only 5 to 6% extracted in China during the same period) and levied largely to fund regional warfare. Combined with the use of labour and livestock for martial purposes, grain and textile prices were driven up, along with nominal wages, reducing the competitiveness of Indian handicrafts and impacting even the domestic textile trade.

The parallel, political death of Mughal India derived from a combination of factors, such as imperial overstretch, fratricidal wars of succession and finally the cataclysmic invasions of the Persian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739, followed by those of the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Abdali.  Scarcely less invasive were the raids across the subcontinent by the indigenous Maratha Confederacy, whose armies burned, plundered, raped and levied huge sums of protection money, while building little civil society in the regions they marauded.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdPUEJJQnhYS3Z0dXVocW5YS2UtQlpLNDFiMkRBQmZPcWI1NE94eHkyOHlWLTdLOW40WXlPRWdwLXBzOWU4bzViVUZ2RUlTYXphYWoxdHlZYURZRFlyM3c9PQ==

"They definitely did. This would change fro time to time, but Vincent Brown's book, Tacky's Revolt talks about different groups that enslavers in Jamaica wanted to avoid b/c they were thought to be too rebellious or too war like and a threat to their hold on power.

After that the fashion switched to Fante people, but after Tacky's revolt, the Fante fell out of  favor and slavers started looking for other groups that could be marketed as more docile.

"I’m interested in learning about Germanic and Roman history, but there is a reason I’ve avoided learning about it in detail and have preferred learning about history elsewhere. I’ve found that people discussing the Roman empire and Germanic tribes, especially the former, tend to have biased opinions on what defines a “sophisticated” culture and civilization, which can quickly devolve into explicit racism. Even those that are more tempered in their biases tend to glorify and romanticize Rome in a way that makes me skeptical of the veracity of their statements. I think that Rome, its conflict with Germanic tribes, and the emergence of modern Europe is both fascinating and undeniably important to understanding the modern world. I just want to learn about it in a way that doesn’t frame Rome as delivering the light of civilization to the barbaric tribes of Western Europe, who from there brought civilization to the new world and global south. 

Unfortunately, I do not have the funds to purchase really anything that isn’t an essential need at this time, so any book that doesn’t have a free pdf isn’t accessible to me.

"Yes! Much more robust than us, comparing our rib cage to their rib cage (from my understanding) allowed much more core strength and their arms had more slow twitch fibers, allowing for greater strength with the trade off of less dexterity.

I may be pulling from many different sources off the top of my head, but to my recollection the hypothesis is that the thin bone projectiles found were driven into the animal. The shaft of the spear was an important tool and they kept multiple of these points on them in a hunt. Unlike homo sapien hafting points with twine and tar/sap like glue, the spears had a notch where a projectile could be pressure fit into place. Total armchair enthusiast only, but I could imagine a group of burly Neanderthals could make quick work of the large elk and other prey with that technology allowing them to make multiple deep strikes. 

I would imagine a bone projectile placed in the correct spot would massively cripple their prey from running as fast as it splintered with movement.  Or maybe it just made the megafauna very very pissed and there were many flattened ancestors before something else was devised!

The fossils we have show so much rich history. Broken bones, bad arthritis to the point that their family must have taken care of them to live to older ages, while being disabled.

"I'm afraid to say I've not heard of your book, though I might see if I can find it over here in the UK.   
  
I worked in the videogames business in my misspent 20's, and know a fair few of the developers in R\\* North's edinburgh studios. RDR2 has been a stunning game in my opinion for the quality of worldbuilding and scriptwriting. only problem I've had with it is the fact I absolutely suck at it!   
    
After I moved on from that business, I've ended up also with a high degree of academic expertise in history, with my field being medieval history, particularly arms and armour and the social, economic and cultural impacts of its development in the arms race of the 14-15th century europe.  And well, historical medieval games are, almost universally, bloody awful nonsense with glaring anachronisms, culturally misplaced nonsense at best, and depicting utter idiotic stuff half the time.  Playing though, I'm usually going ""oh god, what is this shit?"" ""really? where did they do their research? did they do research?"" and the likes  
  
As Americana isnt a subject I've got that expertise with, I haven't had that kind of reaction to RDR - and I'd like to just ask, have you have any similar reactions playing RDR / RDR2, or has it been sufficiently well-researched that its not got glaring errors to you?

"This is a touchy area b/c people misconstrue how the Atlantic slave system worked to turn blame back around on the various African people, but Europeans didn't penetrate into Africa.

They set up forts on the coast and would purchase enslaved people that were brought to them. There were fights between various Europeans in different places at different times, but they were to control these areas.

"Hey! Great question. As far as I understand it, the first real wave of ""back to the land"" folks leaving cities and returning to ""simpler"" (country life not actually simpler, just different) lives was in the 1930s, with the Great Depression. That means that 1899 would be rather early for this to be a mass phenomenon, though of course there were individual families who left cities to return to rural roots. But the big story of the 1890s is URBANIZATION, not de-urbanization. American cities were swelling at a tremendous rate in this period! So much more often you'd see country folks heading to town, not the other way around.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSc1hiOGZNdkdKeGVnMFJoWWFaTGdOT3FGQVhoRjV1Q2VsaUZndGVSUEZmMmhLQWtWWDcwNkd6T1R5VUxVOEx2SEMzTnVVZzJHVUdMRlc2S0Q4S1FXeU5LcXE2Zm51d3lJNkRXcUYyZVhySWM9
"Hey! My hardcover book should be available in the UK. The audiobook - narrated by Roger Clark, aka RDR2's Arthur Morgan, is definitely available right now across the world. 

As for your question, yes, RDR2 is one of the most historically thoughtful and nuanced blockbuster games that I've played. There are others that are richer - some of the Paradox strategy games, especially - but they're not nearly as popular.

As for your question - the most glaring errors - lots of things from the game make lots of sense in the early 1870s, and much less sense in 1899. Open warfare between Native people and the US Army? The Pinkertons chasing western outlaws? The Ku Klux Klan out in public? All very, very unlikely in 1899. All very likely in, say, 1872.

Also, there's basically no party politics in the game, and the labor movement is a blip on the radar. Both were of MASSIVE significance to real Americans in 1899.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSX18xT2FLS0kzZURzTzd5SWFvTTFBemtGc0hvNDRiUXZuOTdMa2luX2JhRm9lLXc0NEszQ01CQ3UwSkUwOUJ0VFlOT2hwYk5Qekg2RlA4Z0RTSVFMVUNjUXFWckZza0xzWHotWXhJWkJSWFk9
"I once heard a theory that I'm rather partial to, regarding the United States' proclivity to violent history.
Following the hostile invasion, the Colonies were used as a 'dumping ground' for English undesirables (debtors, criminals, religious zealots). People to break in the ground for their so-called betters.
It seemed to set the tone. How could we NOT be...turbulent?
But on that same note, it meant that we were engendered with a certain streak of rebellion, which proved useful later.

"I think the game pulls on literary molds as old as Romeo and Juliet, to be sure, but here's my suggestion: I think the Braithwaites and Grays are modeled primarily on the Hatfields and McCoys, America's most famous feuding families.

Oh boy, big question. I actually don't believe that there was an obsession at the time about ""lawlessness."" People cared a lot more about the power of big business, and questions of racial equality. Those were the driving issues in the South and West at this moment.

"Thanks so much for your enthusiasm! I hope you enjoy the book. And great to be in touch with another historian! The book was totally written with an undergrad audience in mind, so I think it would work great in a classroom. And I think crunching through it in 4 weeks isn't crazy, though perhaps a bit cramped. The book is about 80,000 words if that's any measure of it's length; about 240 pages of text. 

I would pair it with other historical video games, maybe Mafia, Call of Duty, L.A. Noire, or others.

My favorite missions are the ones in Saint Denis. Maybe going to the Mayor's mansion with Angelo Bronte? I just love seeing the gang in suit and tie :)

I really wish the game had paid more attention to the US labor movement at the time. It was a towering issue that basically everyone was arguing about, and often fighting about. After all, the Pinkertons by 1899 were mainly crushing labor unions, not chasing outlaws. Just consider the Homestead Strike in western PA in 1892 as one example. I think there's ONE mention of labor unions in the game but that's not nearly enough. I wonder what Arthur would have thought of them?

"Great questions!!! There was TOTALLY a budding environmentalist movement by the 1890s, but folks wouldn't have used that name. They called themselves conservationists, naturalists, or preservationists. Just consider folks like John Muir, who was a major force pushing for the creation of US national parks. Or Gifford Pinchot, whose family owned a big lumber business - but the son was shocked at how private business had denuded and exploited the American countryside.

The first national park founded is Yellowstone, in 1872. It would then be founded by many others soon after RDR2 is set, during the presidency of Teddy Roosevelt. In fact, one of the coolest thing the game COULD have done is in the 1907 epilogue with John Marston, it could have shown the creation of new parks during the years after Morgan died.

"You know, I didn't spend nearly enough time thinking about either of those groups, mainly because they're somewhat peripheral to the main story. But I did spend a lot of time thinking about the Murfree Brood, another group of murderous isolated folks. I came to the conclusion that these guys are cut from the cloth of the worst stereotypes of southern Appalachia rather than actual history itself. They're pulled from movies like *Deliverance* (1972) more than anything else. As I explain in the book, there was a really long campaign across the US to make white southern mountain people look exotic, backward, different, and preserved in amber. The obsession with rural violence is part of that. But ultimately this myth was invented rather than real. And it was really propagated in order to justify the siphoning of wealth from the mountains outward, mainly coal and timber.

Was the US West unusually violent in the late 1800s? Some places were. In boom towns where you had a lot of strangers flooding in, especially when it was mainly men from a range of racial/ethnic groups, violence tended to be more common. There were fewer social bonds preventing violence, and bullets often flew as a result. The homicide rates in some of these towns was as high as 100 per 100,000 - which is way higher than any US cities today. But many pockets of the West were really tame and tranquil, with very LOW violence rates, especially where the population was more homogenous and the balance of women and men was more equal.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUzQ1XzRfbUgzaGVJTWlFcGM1QXZvdDBLM1U0cXRCSk9iNTBHNXRVUTFwM29FdGVMVnc1cHk3N0tSUUJWRmFVaGVTRjYwVlBsbGRKdkozZ3lmendQWUoxQWpZZlZMNjliSFBXMTNIbFBMclk9

"Hey! Thanks for asking. So I learned so many things researching and writing RED DEAD'S HISTORY. Here's just one. One of the most infamous cases in US Supreme Court history is *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896) which basically gave the green light to legalized racial segregation in the US South. It was this case that the Black freedom struggle sought to overturn in the 1950s and 1960s. But I learned - and this shocked me - that there was one dissenting member of the court who voted against his 8 colleagues in 1896. Not only was this guy - John Marshall Harlan - from Kentucky, but he was A FORMER SLAVEHOLDER. But by 1896, he was a firm believer in racial equality and especially equality before the law. Who says people can't change??? Learning that BLEW me away. Also hilarious because he was named after John Marshall, one of the first Supreme Court justices in the nation.

"So I actually devote three chapters of my book to Butcher Creek, because I think it's a stand-in for southern Appalachia (i.e. West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, etc). This was a region that was torn apart by big corporations from outside the region in this very era, which produced a ton of ill effects for local residents. Deforestation destroyed peasant economies in the woods, and coal mining in company towns shortened life spans as well.

Overall I think RDR2 has a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde take on southern Appalachia. On one hand they recycle all of the most tired stereotypes of the region, with its bearded, archaic, uneducated, trapped-in-amber ""hillbillies"" who are isolated from American progress. But then it also shows how Wall Street (i.e. Leviticus Cornwall) was tearing asunder the region in pursuit of wealth.

Likewise, I really wanted to do more with America's imperial push of 1898-9 in Cuba, the Philippines, and beyond. (Uncle even references the Philippines while sitting around the campfire!

"Such a great question!!! So the American diet was changing really quickly in the late 1800s with the rise of massive food processors like the Chicago meatpackers (Swift, Armour, Morris, etc). And these new titans of industry began selling new foods that Americans had never seen before - mainly to get rid of their waste products and earn a dime in the process. Consider oleomargarine - processed beef tallow with salt and yellow coloring added so that it would resemble BUTTER - but WAY grosser. They even marketed it by deceptive names like BUTTERINE to try to trick folks into buying it. Same goes for canned beef, another disgusting byproduct of the Chicago packinghouses. Have you heard of Upton Sinclair's famous book *The Jungle* (1906)? It was a hugely influential book, and led to the passing of the Pure Food and Drug Act soon thereafter.

Given that RDR2 is set a few years before that Act, I think selling something like salted offal would have been totally realistic, but I bet the Chicago packers would have called it by some more deceptively appetizing name. But yes, processed industrial foods in this era were often disgusting.

It's not shocking that the game map is so big. But of course still SOO much smaller than the reality.

"Hey! I love the score and soundtrack of the game but for very non-historical reasons (who doesn't love Willy Nelson and Rhiannon Giddens or Woody Jackson?) But you know, I haven't thought all that much about the campfire songs. I need to look into it more. Which are your favorites? Can you send some clips of them from YouTube?

For the more edgy details of American history, thankfully there's dozens of books about sexuality and romantic culture. Given that the GTA games featured prostitution within their game worlds, it's somewhat surprising that RDR2 doesn't, given the prevalence of this practice around the turn of the century. But I am happy that they didn't, because I'm so tired of Rockstar games that only treat women as sexual objects. The female characters of the van der Linde gang are thankfully so much more than that.

You know what I'd like to see more of in the game? Openly gay characters. One might think - oh, people weren't out of the closet in that period. But that's *totally* wrong. Indeed, the idea of a closet didn't even exist in the 1890s. There was much more public awareness of queer identities at that moment than there would have been in the 1950s or even 1980s.

"I’ll also throw out that those characters were from the east coast, and probably influenced by Whitman and the other Transcendental poets. There was also a movement in Europe beginning in the 1830’s and 1840’s that generated a lot of Romantic landscape art, essentially depicting the unspoiled purity of nature and “Gods country”. The Transcendental poets were the literary successors of this Romanticism, and they had an impact before the turn of the century.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSU3FvaDg2azBpS0pRY19VX3JCTTNPN2Nwb2paaGxZTXRWZ3RSZ3RrWmdCTFFhNGJ5TmM2WkRqYWFMNDJwLWNkbG5rNDdRTHFhcnJvV2p0RlM1ZHRvU1hsSmRyQ1hKeWdYdnNjNHJWV3Faa2M9
"This is also one of the reasons why the American working class had a harder time mobilizing and winning social reforms like their counterparts in northern Europe.

I would LOVE a RDR3 that's another prequel. Charles would be amazing. But so would Arthur - at like age 18, in 1873? That would be a crazy moment to set the game. In the epilogue of my book, I give my view of what RDR3 should look like, and it's an 1870s game.

"Hey! So the National Audubon Society was founded in 1905, so just after RDR2, and they were all about bird preservation and habitat protection (though many shot birds too to paint and admire them). So there was clearly a movement budding at the time!

What I find a bit paradoxical about RDR2 though is that it portrays rural America as this place teeming with wildlife, almost as an Edenic garden untouched by humanity. That's really far from the truth. The 1890s were actually a terrible time to be a wild animal. The bison was on the verge of extinction, with only a few hundred left alive. And the passenger pigeon - a bird that had literally darkened the skies with their massive flocks in the earlier years of the 1800s - had gone extinct around the turn of the century. The American landscape was in many ways gutted and denuded at that moment. That is what spurred the national parks and conservation movements, in large part!",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdSUVRXUzBGcW9FQjB3a3lXMlc3REZydVpIQVZKd0FFT0kyRHhuQXJpVDNUUndXTk9WZ2pYSGhUV2plZmlHRjZ0TEtqN1BpTnFtekpoNVlVakJOMk02QkNmUmxOQktsMHQxTlhIc3N2elp3U289

I think hands down the most historically accurate location in the game is Saint Denis, as New Orleans. The architecture and layout is so spot on!

"Yeah, in my head, I thought playing Charles Father for the first chapter, then you play Charles, and in the last chapter, you meet the Gang & you experience the Wild West from a Natives perspective. Because at the start of RDR2, Arthur asks Charles ""why you with us? You could run a gang by yourself, "" and that implied to me that Charles was a very experienced man before he met the Gang.

"I have read many histories and narratives on this subject and there is reason to be skeptical. While there are instances where a collective group of slaves may work together on a specific scheme to steal food or even beat/kill an overseer or, even rarely, a master, the development of a communication system like this is unlikely. Black slaves were not a uniformed collection of brothers and sisters united in solidarity. The institution was setup to ensure they weren't. For every 5 slaves there were two who legitimately LOVED their ""white folk"". The slave next to you could be sold tomorrow, why be loyal to him? In short, masters would know every part of that system, prohibit its use, and punish anyone using it. SNITCHING was very real and very common. You'd have to get past a ""boss""- the highest ranking mean black slave and the two-faced old slaves who were paid in food and candy. While slaves were in bondage, theoretically, they weren't always in ""bondage"" and in a position to want to escape. A plantation was an ordered system around forced labor that people were born into. The typical mindset evaluated one's condition by how much the master kept up his part of the arrangement (food, seasonal clothes, medical care, housing arrangement, time off/leisure time, and whether the overseers were allowed to be brutal. When the Yankees came, many opted to stay. After the War many, including my family on both sides, opted to be sharecroppers. ""My white folks was good to me"" is common in many of the slave narratives. I say this to say that these urban legends come about because Americans (black and white) refuse to think critically about the brainwashing involved in the institution. Sure, you had patrols, slave catchers, and bounty hunters. But the system on the plantation, including your kin made a systemic strategy to run away all of the time nowhere in the common slave's psyche.

"Wine cellars in Northern California easily reach 60 degrees F and all of France, Germany and the British Isles are much further north than that so it would be easy to get down into the 40s (F) by digging down. 

Castles tended to need deep(er) foundations (at least 10-20 ft or 3-6m) and that depth into (or supported by) solid rock puts that temperature within easy reach especially if there are no nearby heat sources (which include human bodies).

"When you go back in history, you will find that people had a very good understanding of practical engineering or the end result but not the ""why"" which is a focus of modern engineering. For example:

A plumb bob is a straight vertical line down. Why and how? Nope. It just does.

Water finds its own level. It just does. Exactly why and what vectors and forces cause this? Nope.

This applied to a lot of science:

Agriculture - plants grew better when pee was dumped on the plant. Yes, that is because urine is rich in nitrogen and nitrogen helps plants grow. But exactly how? History guy: Nope.

Chemistry - Fire burns hotter when its is blown on. Yes, combustion happens because of oxidization and air contains oxygen but did they know that air contained oxygen? Nope.

Metallurgy - Copper gets harder and brittle when worked. It happens because hammering introduces defects in the crystalline structure of the metal. What? Crystals? I don't see crystals but I do know that when I hammer copper it gets hard and can hold an edge but if I want to soften it, I heat it up.

Biology - if I coat a wound with honey, it doesn't turn green and smelly and the person doesn't die. Yes, the high sugar content of honey has antiseptic properties because the sugar content at this level is toxic to aerobic because hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and methylglyoxal (MGO), actively kill bacterial cells. Nope - it just happens because Melisseus blesses us.

Many of these things were the ""secrets"" of masons, farmers, smiths and healers and they were guarded jealously. For example: look at the medieval guilds. They guarded those secrets jealously and were only passed on from master to apprentice.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdob251NFBIZ1otRXJ2MFFPeGY3alotaWRpa2JIYldHYXhLOGJRVHNEQmxLNFJZNEdFTXNLTFQ3TVR3QWJNeHZFWVpvSHZ1VTllQTVKcHRhdWNlYTV5ZjdfcG9Qelg3VjB3a2pFSjNGQjByWVE9

"So, I just want to start by saying that I heard about your book from a professor at a local university I just started full time employment with, and I am soooo glad she told me about it. I'm currently half way through the audiobook and I'm thoroughly enjoying it!

Anyway, my comment is specifically addressing the want for more openly gay characters in general. I'm not sure if you know it or not, but within the RDR community it's pretty well known/accepted that Bill Williamson's character is/was gay. Of course, it's not ""openly"" discussed in the game, but it is hinted at HARD. The gang even mildly teases him from time to time in RDR2 about it, but it's always just in jest (nothing really malicious) and still is just implied, not directly said. I do wish they had fully confirmed/fleshed that out, but I felt that it was worth noting.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdpWnlPckg5TDkwU0NIeUJsTDZ0a3BOUUN4WWZtRXRnOC1nZTk0YlhzcGRwZ2U4c3RHZ0lvc1lPSjNMRS1iTmFHNkJTSE91Vi11U1dadmZ6TGJabk5TaGc9PQ==
"So, I just want to start by saying that I am currently listening to your audiobook and am thoroughly enjoying it! I also am so happy that I learned about it by complete accident. I just recently started a new full time job for a local to me university and during some of my new employee orientation training, I met a professor of Environmental Science that supposedly knows you, and she suggested your book. The only reason she brought it up is because during one of the icebreaker activities, I brought up that my kids are named after characters in RDR/RDR2. Yes, you read that right... My wife and I have had such a love and connection with the games that we named our twins after two of its characters! So, your book, per her suggestion, was and has been perfect for me! I hope to see more content like yours in the years to come, because I believe, like you do, that history presented in the context of gaming can usher in a whole new generation of history lovers.

Anyway, I don't really have a question yet (as I haven't finished the audiobook). I just wanted to give my kudos to you and say it's hilarious that I literally learned of your book this past Thursday, bought the audiobook on Saturday, and see today that you posted an AMA.

A Stranger in the Land by Daniel Cil Brecher.

It is a book written by an Israeli expat and former director of the Leo Baeck Institute in Haifa about his time living in Israel, and how Israeli nationalism treated the Diaspora Jews, and the way they talked about Holocaust survivors. The crux of the book was his experience being called up in the IDF reserve in 1984 during the Lebanon War, and his disillusionment with Israeli nationalism.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdpOS1Ram9HVzh2bklXQzc4N3NjbXB6R1ZQLXBKTl94clh4RnRhQUNfZjdPeVBUdVp6TWR2UmtJWnN1aURONnplUEFNS1NVQ3dGSFg3ZFpuaDVCVDVvTG1qckZIems5c3hxSlRmUWtJNHJnV1E9

"That's a pretty subjective statement. I consider the mountain men and early explorers as part of the wild west and their legacy goes back to the mid 18th century. 

I suppose you're specifically talking about cattle drives and cowboys/range wars and fighting native Americans in the late 1800s.

Even that isn't accurate as the Chisholm and Oregon trail (1810 to 40) were open for decades before that (1860s). The first large scale cattle drive was in 1860s as well.

Nearly every book, documentary or TV show I've seen breaks down the wild west into a 200 year period.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqR2RfZlo1MC1BdDJaaEMtNXlrWlNMSXNlbEg3NWhQSjMxU1BnODhKaHA2eHJoMjd5TWNoM0hnbmJzb012VGdNYU1peW9IV3BqQ3A3YzhXdUhmbFMzLVE9PQ==
"Not OP but I’m a big history fan with 1800s being one of my favorite eras of history. The Skinners are most likely based off scalp hunting gangs. The government put bounties on the scalps of natives. They were generally priced as adult or child, yes the government from time to time would offer bounties for the scalps of native children. Now there’s no famous/infamous scalp hunting gang but it was often done in groups because attacking a native village or hunting party by yourself is how you end up dead. Also it wasn’t unheard of for scalp hunters in the southwestern part of America to kill and scalp Mexican because like Native Americans they’ve got darker skin and dark black hair and in the 1800s prove that it’s native and not Mexican or vice versa. Now I say all of that to say that it’s no impossible that a scalp hunting group got to the point where they enjoyed what they did but native scalp bounties largely ended at the same time as the Indian wars ended. So it’s not impossible for a group of bloodthirsty and sadistic scalp hunter to turn their attention from natives/mexicans to anyone and everyone they find.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqaWg0aWhWRE0ycWRVd3prRnFnVU9CRzNtTWRhS0FUazk3bmFySDRrZFdRZjVEUWRnNWprZnIxOGhZd2txTlBqb1ZLMEJXanNXTk1pb0RIU0pEdnJacGc9PQ==

""Kitchi Con, Kitchi Stan, Kitchi Con-Stan-Ti, Kitchi Cople, Kitchi Knople, Kitchi Con-Stan-Ti-Nople.""

Does anyone know where it came from? Considering Constantinople hasn't been a thing since 1930, he must have learned it at school? Or is it older?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGdqZEhGYXVtdWpBU1dGOGxMWXVCcGp5LXR3T0dISDlpT0ZHME1meFFoN2hCTUYtMllPNGxscHF1TE9BNUFJbzdEeDc1Ulo4VUI0RXNMMkhmdkU5TEQyb0syZEZDdW1zalN6c09lSEZhTF9ZMHc9

"Niall Ferguson has written for *The Free Press* a forceful rebuttal of false claims presented without pushback in a recent Tucker Carlson podcast. Ferguson’s essay is more historiographical than some other responses, as he zooms out to consider the status of historical writing and publishing in the age of podcasts, X posts, and Substack missives. He argues, “What we are dealing with in this conversation is the opposite of history: call it anti-history… Darryl Cooper offers a series of wild assertions that are almost entirely divorced from historical evidence and can be of interest only to those so ignorant of the past that they mistake them for daring revisionism, as opposed to base neo-Nazism.”",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PeTlYcDluZURDZElDTkktbzljQkpBa0NGN1VLUC1DTFBzd1BMa3pQZUlNWWF2clpGQlltdlA2TUtsWGVVYmhKbEZPWjVsREJKT1BhenFXa0NpcU9hbHh0cnBRWHFlUmNvWEJLdXV2RF9Pdnc9

"What were the Founding Fathers’ intentions behind the Second Amendment to the US Constitution?

I know that this amendment has been interpreted over the years especially nowadays regarding gun ownership in the US. What was the original intent behind this amendment? The reason why I am asking is that the US gets more school shootings than any other country and the US has lax laws on guns. What was the original purpose of the amendment and is it still relevant in today’s world?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PZy1kc2NyblljRWR3dERIS2VaRVptY0VxWUlmZ3pEOHRZMEJCVDBmZktiT2cwQWsyb2l3amxyR0Nlb3VZN09jMHdycENMME01UlJQelljWVBucGhwd3ZsNUFQUDdycnFYNFpjNTk0TUsxenc9

"The US did not intend to have a standing army. They would only be called up when needed, as they viewed standing armies as tools of oppressors (Boston Massacre, Quartering Act, etc.) Instead, militias would act as local defense in response to immediate action, which would give towns and cities further down the road time to prepare, and a wider call up of troops if necessary. This is viewable in the original text. 

>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 

When the British invaded, one of the first things they did in certain areas was go after the gun powder supplies. These were rally points where local militias would go and get the supplies they needed (besides those kept at home). Ensuring people could still have militias to defend the area against tyrannical peoples, including their own government, was seen as necessary in reaction to the ongoing revolution against the colonies' government. This was written with revolution in mind. Personal rights of gun ownership were of course something as well, but that sort of thing wasn't really heavily debated at this point; there would be no real need to tell people they could have guns, because of course they could.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9PV05NYkpBQ0lKS3l3OTRDVVJBb2dBNUg5eVdKajBNVmJ1WWZILXlpTmEyY1FhYVJLVlRZU1ZFUi11UFc1SmJKaGNvdk5Yczc1QXdkR21tc0QwZlA1cmc9PQ==

However, there have since been archaeological findings which have shown that the disease had likely been in Europe before then. However, we also see it occurring in America before Europeans.

Martin Gilbert's Concise History of the Twentieth Century is Terribly Inaccurate

  


I've been reading ""esteemed historian"" Martin Gilbert's A History of the Twentieth Century (Concise edition), and almost finished it at this point. I want to like this book, the narrative format reads really well.

Problem is, it's extremely, terribly inaccurate. Like half the time when I want to look up more info about an interesting historical event, the dates or even basic facts are wrong. Seriously, it reads like there was no editor at all, and Sir Gilbert just wrote the book entirely off his memory without checking a solitary fact. The overall narrative is more or less right, but it's like all these facts, dates, names are off.

I finally lost it when I read that the 747, the first jumbo jet, started commercial service on February 12, 1982. 1982! It was 1971! It's not even the right decade! It sounds like one tiny fact, one mistake that's inconsequential to the grand flow of history. But these mistakes are everywhere! And he's not even in the right decade, forget year, month or day. Like even on a basic level that fails the sanity check, jet age air travel was well established in the West by the 80s. And I checked, nothing related to the 747 of note even happened on this date. He just straight up lied and made it up.

Just to be clear, this has nothing to do with bias. I understand everyone will have a bias, a viewpoint, whatever. Some more extreme than others, some left wing, right wing, whatever. It's basic facts that are wrong! Dates especially, but to a lesser extent other ""hard facts"". Extremely frustrating, wtf.

Has anyone else actually read this book, like ever? Forget an editor or the publisher. Shame on Sir Gilbert. Anyone else? Bueller? Maybe someone who works at Perennial Books, the publisher, will see this.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9RLTVoOU96ZkpMREgxSzVINDdYODRKeEF0VTBQbWVXanRZSVkzTXA2TW5WMDl1czQxcDdpVVdLS0Z4WGQ2R0FRN2F5OXZFWHhlcUVEQ1hUdlZ1djEwVUE9PQ==

"From the article: 

was on a visit to the bunker when wartime prime minister Winston Churchill declared: “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few”.

For some reason Churchill is being revisited recently on social media about his intentions of bombing cities and forcing the Germans to do the same. Has it been accepted that it was in retaliation for Germany hitting civilian targets first? Or did the British force Germany to focus on civilian targets to divert bombers away from their dwindling military resources?

I would probably get the Elizabeth Samet annotated version. They did a nice job with it and it didn't sell well so you can find cheap remaindered copies. But her scholarship is solid and it's a lovely book. The Nolen and Gallo annotated version is also excellent. You can't really go wrong with either. And I'd recommend the annotated versions over his straight memoir b/c there's a lot of context that's hard to know if you weren't in the middle of the big movers and shakers in the 2nd half of the 19th century.

It's important to realise the defenders in Masada were not highly regarded by the Jewish defenders who threw them out of Jerusalem. Nor was their military skill highly regarded.

">Why would they have to be Scandinavian?

I'm not claiming  they are necessarily Scandinavian. But the earliest proof we have of Scandinavians playing chess are pieces from 12th century, so we assume that's when Scandinavians started playing chess. If these were chess pieces, it would push back the spread of chess into Scandinavia (which Iceland is part of culturally, if not geographically), by at least 100-200 years, which would be a significant discovery.

Obviously not showing up in a few books isn't proof of anything. But one thing that indicates to me that it wasn't is that I looked through Evan's book, Lying About Hitler. He wrote it after the Irving/Lipstadt trial to address the lies that Irving was pushing forward in Neo Nazi circles. What happens today isn't necessarily an indication of what happened in the past, but so many of the Neo Nazi/Holocaust Denier/Antisemite claims today are just rehashed claims from the Nazis, that if it was a frequent argument back then, you would see something about it now.

Rather it seems there were between 2-4 (depends on how you look at the evidence) periods of brief but impactful contact, but for whatever reason it didn't persist.

But there's no evidence of any contact in central America so it seems unlikely they sailed down the coast.

IIRC his video shows Polynesian contact in the area that is now Colombia and an outlying genetic marker in Western Mexico.  The Ancient America video offers an explanation for the outlier by opening with a description of coastal trade routes from Peru to Mexico.,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aZHgyaHVVX2NZcVhVUXM3X28yYjlmN0tUdHF5WUNiS0VCSlJsa0JDWHMwZTlVZTlKeDlrNU9RY0VpZW9sNktkZW8zNWRORVJja0UtOHVUQy15S1VDTFE9PQ==
"That would be the easiest way to explain the Austronesian genetic signal in the Americas.   If it were only South American foodstuffs ending up in Polynesia that could be explained by coastal traders being blown out to see by a storm and carried to Polynesia by prevailing winds.

Of course, you could write an even more dramatic story about some South American traders being blown off course and ending up in the Marquesas where some Polynesian navigators decide to take the strangers beck to their homeland by sailing far to the east.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0zNl9aVDA4NG1kaFExTU85TjV2aGlkRUJCZU1ES3AzbFJDX3pfdjJxT2Nhc1RSa2huMmt5NXcwdjhkN1c3R3FOQUR5MUtaZTNzdEswdFBjUy1DNGx0QnNDdXc9PQ==

Surfing came about organically in both places. I highly doubt the people on the Peruvian coast “taught” the Hawaiians how to surf.

"One is based on academic inquiry and scientific date, the other is based on guesswork and vibes.

"I’m not sure if I’m reading this comment chain correctly, and I sympathize with being annoyed with dubious historical claims that people propagate to try to raise one society’s history up at the expense of another’s, but for what it’s worth, I don’t think the comment you’re responding to suggested that the Inca Tupac Yupanqui was in Polynesia *before* anyone else, just that he was there.

Tupac Yupanqui lived roughly 9 to 7 centuries after Hawaii was already inhabited, so there is nothing about the claim that is wrong on a pure order of events question of who got there first. As to whether his travels there are even plausible, I severely doubt it.

"So that’s where I’d say it’s only relevant as a piece of trivia. Röhm was a cofounder of the gestapo but himmler headed it for its almost entire existence.

It’s also worth noting that Himmler and Goebbels used the homosexuality present in the SA to ramp up persecution after the Night of the Long Knives.,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0ZjBBQ0hXdmx0OEN4cDZXNzFfNmlkNW1BakRlcnVxYWYzQ0VENTJJU1lRLXo3b2c3RUhDdzJIWHJ2MERtZ0hXUER0aWFraDV6ZWpFX01Qb0RfVTIxVmc9PQ==
"Röhm was certainly a co-conspirator of Hitler's in the DAP and then the Nazi party and also had a history of military service in WWI. He did help establish the SA as well. With that said, I think, based on his execution during the Night of Long Knives, it'd be appropriate to conclude that Hitler and the Nazi party at least recognized Röhm's value in organizing fighters and military knowledge, despite his homosexuality. Once the Nazis assumed power in 1932-33, Hitler saw the SA more as a threat as they outnumbered the military and the SS, and had strong working class ties that caused Hitler to worry about their proximity to communism. Röhm was far from the only leader of the SA to be executed on the Night of Long Knives, though, and while his homosexuality was probably *part* of the reason for his execution, I think it's also appropriate to say his leadership of the largest paramilitary organization in Nazi Germany appeared to be a threat to the new Reichstag leadership.

In Röhm's case, I think his homosexuality came second to his military prowess until it became necessary to get rid of him for both reasons.

This is all to say, I think Röhm's being allowed to lead the SA wasn't an allowance as a gay man, but as a military leader in a party who needed to organize millions of street fighters.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB0ZkhpTVAxUi1uYnNrWjdBODEwYXE1VmxsYnpoUGx3NjdRWUxmYWY5N2xGajljUDZoMU1LY3N5WGFhZUctRDlCS3B3SEVlbmVJb3hySGwwSV9Nd3RkbnpxRVZaNGhVblBRMUJUUWVrTjFqUlk9

"In the Pale of Calais, sure, otherwise less so. Following its conquest in 1347, Edward III had the population of the inner city expulged & replaced by English settlers. The reverse took place in 1558, when the French retook it. But other than that, in the context of *composite states*, that rarely happened. Administration was in the local language, irregardless of what the ruling elite or dominant demographic within the broader political unit spoke. The Low Countries did not start speaking Castilian or Austrian, England did not start speaking Norman-French, etc. 

Migration, the biggest prompter of such changes, was also less common (Calais was the odd one out) - mobility of that kind was not particularly common, certainly not in the 15th century when Europe was still reeling from the loss of population of the 14th century, but overall, remember that wealth was seen in people and land and few lords would want to see their folk just up and leave. You'd certainly find small communes of traders and such, but fully dominated demographic units I have never come across.

">the word ‘LGBT’

LGBT is an initialism, not word, referencing 'lesbian, gay, bisexual, (and) trans'.

"Words also have history, but due to social use/slang, aren't often set in stone definitionally. There isn't really a known date aside from a vague timeframe of the 1920s-40s for when 'gay' became synonymous with 'homosexual'. But 'lesbian' was in use by the 1890s as a way to reference homosexual women. Sure 'gay' may have meant something different at the same time, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a reference also to homosexual men.

Feel free to fact check me, but I've already done it myself. I maintain that referring to the persecuted community referenced in this post as LGBT is appropriate.

"> they didn't make a distinction between someone being trans, bisexual or even just into crossdressing, they were just tried as homosexuals.

That's not true, you were tried as a homosexual specifically if you were a pre-operational trans woman who had sexual relations with men. In that time, transness was mostly diagnosed as a type of intersex disorder (and Hirschfeld also saw homosexuality as a type of intersexuality) but they were aware of distinctions between the groups.

Hirschfeld introduced a type of legal recognition of transgender people (called Transvestitenpass) and while the usage definitely greatly decreased during the Nazi era, mostly because most of them were given out by Hirschfeld's institute, which was majorly Jewish, there are multiple documented cases of people receiving them after the Nazi takeover and the police respecting them.

Another relatively high famous case was Heinrich Rathjen, who was likely intersex. Heinrich was born as Dora and competed for Germany as a woman at the 1936 Olympics. His intersex status became known in the late 1930s and he was allowed to transition to male under Nazi rule.

We also have Nazi-era documents about the trans women who received sex change operations under Hirschfeld in the 1920s and as far as I know, all of them were treated as fully female legally by the Nazis also (despite the fact that their transitions were widely reported in the newspapers at the time) and none faced prosecution for being trans. (Also unfun fact: the doctor who performed the first known vaginoplasty later performed forced medical experiments on prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp).

Similarly, cross dressing was technically illegal (unless you had a Transvestitenpass) but in practice this was only enforced if it was in a homosexual context. For example, Wehrmacht soldiers actually [took photos of themselves cross dressing relatively often](https://www.creativeboom.com/inspiration/soldier-studies-fascinating-photographs-of-cross-dressing-in-the-third-reichs-army/)",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTB2Qkx0SS04RlQ2VHdDbmRyNmo5Rkl5ODRGclJPSWt2WXk0cGI1T2pZM0dPN3U3aUd1TWtxT0pLZGlpOWVzSmZMNmlFNGd6bW1NUFBzUlkxbmxaWkcxMHc9PQ==

I was going to say, by how do we define ""most important""?

Maybe an otherwise meaningless battle had a strategic consequence, based on even a small detail.

Example:

Carrhae - How important was it really?  And was it important (or not) in the context of Roman - Parthian relations?  OK, BUT was its REAL important the simple fact that the Roman defeat there included the death of the Crassus. Broke the Triumvirate, setting up the civil war between Caesar and Pompey?

Better yet, saw an interesting take recently that conventional wisdom tends to write of the naval battle of Jutland as ""unimportant"".  

It wasn't a decisive battle.  Both sides took losses, but Neither side sustained game changing, military breaking losses.  No major tactical objectives were achieved.  

Hell, people can barely even agree on which side ""won"".  

BUT, as an alternate interpretation pointed out, 

the ability of the British to blockade Germany **WAS** hugely impactful to WWI, and the (for the sake of argument, let's say stalemate) at Jutland, makes it clear to the Germans that challenging the British Navy was not a viable option.

Ended any idea of breaking the blockade by force.

Probably factored in pushing the Germans to resort to unrestricted submarine warfare, which obviously had its own unwelcome consequences for them.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAwUmhmZ0ROOHhYZFR5VGhzZmM4ZmxGelM4dmFsR3FtQWtvLTJnU2t6UDZCaTZQc3lvVVlGQnVZRWk3Ry1XNEVqVkNSWmIyaVNlUU9fV1dyR0ttNnM3T3c9PQ==

"Depends on which parts of the subcontinent. By the time the Battle of Plassey took place, the Mughal Empire was basically a puppet: the Muslim Durrani Empire and predominantly Hindu Maratha Empire were still struggling over control of Delhi, the city that the Mughal Empire used as their capital. When the power vacuum continued, it was temporarily filled by the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. It's very difficult to answer counterfactuals in history (any question that involves ""if 'X' had not happened, then 'Z' would have/would not have happened"") though most histories I've read suggest that the Mughals declined after Emperor Akbar was murdered, and instead of continuing his policy of religious tolerance his successors decided to antagonize their non-Muslim subjects by doubling down on religious supremacism and pissed away the empire's treasury on wars of conquest. It's plausible that *some* regions of India would have stayed under the control of Muslim Sultans but, again, even without British military intervention there were signs that the central Muslim power in India represented by the Mughal Empire was on the way out and being actively challenged by their former Hindu and Sikh subjects.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAwa1RGOEFwbzF2V1VRb2NaX3FXMndPeU9jZk5IZXYyYlMyZ29SQTZYTUNreWNnLVAzS3NNZmFzOHE4aDNjbXVabzgweWhUU3lpYV8wcTBxd1J1eExickE9PQ==

"The deterioration is interesting, but not unexpected. It's hard, sometimes, to tell students just why we lose so many ships from antiquity unless they sank in the perfect circumstances. For example, we know exactly where the battle of the Aegates Islands took place (the naval battle which ended the First Punic War) the largest such underwater archaeology expedition. However, we're not pulling up intact ships, rather the caps of the rams, the weapons, coins, and armour. There is sometimes a bit of wood inside the ram cap itself, but for the most part the ships are just gone.

"I apologize--I didn't take the time to refresh myself properly and you're right. Akbar was not murdered, according to a brief skim of the internet it seems he suspected his successor Salim of trying to poison him but I concede that nothing I've found implies Akbar was killed.

As for the comment about religious antagonism, I've taken the time to look into it and I was thinking of Emperor Aurangzeb. I wish I was able to go back and find the specific academic source, but the general story I was told is that Aurangzeb was highly preoccupied with conquest--though there appears to be ongoing debate amongst modern historians as to whether Aurangzeb's conquests actually sparked an economic crisis, or to what extent he actually enforced Muslim law over the non-Muslim religious communities in the Mughal Empire (clearly, my professors favored one side of the debate over the other). Aurangzeb did order the execution of Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur, though again sources conflict over the moral basis: Mughal sources accused Guru Tegh Bahadur of banditry, whereas Sikh sources claim the Guru was executed for refusing Aurangzeb's demands to give up the Sikh faith.

Indian history is, in my opinion, very unusual in terms of how much disagreement and debate there is over what events are connected by cause and effect or just coincidence. It's not a case of peer-reviewed academics on one side vs ignorant-but-noisy tinfoil hatters on the other, but deep divisions where groups of respected academics still can't reach a consensus on what caused what or why. However, specific times and sequences of events are things that historians can at least agree on most of the time. I'll at least stand by my earlier position: while this is purely speculation, the Mughal Empire had fallen heavily into disarray without direct involvement by the East India Company (don't get me wrong, the Battle of Plassey was disastrous for the Mughals, but the Mughals were on a losing streak long before that). The rapid rise of both the Maratha Empire/Maratha Confederation and the vibrant but short-lived Sikh Empire, in my opinion, serve as evidence that the EIC weren't the only non-Muslim power capable of filling the power vacuum the Mughals left behind.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm01RTAyOERmV1JoMjJKZXM3bzJuMkpBUkp0LUllVEEzNmJmWkJMWlNNMHlTVTRDRDg0aXB5R01fcUFPUDRwZ3UxLUc0dE5xbldiRE44QmhPak9LTnV4dzh1UlE9PQ==

"Not so much a question but more so just a comment on how life like and realistic RD2 was for me. I grew in a ranching and farming family in a very rural area. Even though I am clearly not from 1890s, a lot of the game is very reminiscent of what modern experiences can be like. Mostly in the personalities of the characters. Arthur always reminded me of my grandpa, and his death hit very close to home. And hearing my grandpa's stories and the history of my family. 


RD2 was very personal to me because it felt like I could have been looking into a time my family actually experienced and to some extent is passed on today to their descendants. If that makes any sense. Most Americans will never be able to experience this type of thing. But for me the game just reminded me of my family growing up.

"Just to respond to the last part of the question, the decision to switch from the RAF airfields to bombing London was made by Goering and wasn't something forced by the British. For context, prior to this, they'd been an accidental hit on London by a lost German bomber which provoked a very small ""tit for tat"" raid on Berlin that caused nothing in the way of damage, but this wasn't the main driver behind his decision. A constant overestimate by Luftwaffe pilots over how many planes they had shot down had convinced the Germans that the RAF couldn't have many more planes left, yet time was running out for an invasion as the weather would get too bad in October and the Germans still hadn't gained the needed air superiority in the south of England for the invasion to go ahead. Goering believed that if he launched bombing raids on London the RAF would have to come out and fight (as opposed to husbanding their resources which they had been doing all summer), and his fighters could then clean up thus clearing the skies for the invasion to go ahead. 

Of course, this didn't quite turn out how the Germans expected. 

With the invasion no longer an option until Spring, the Germans opted for strategic night bombing, attacking British cities across the country from September 1940 to March 1941 in the hope that the British would sue for peace. The indiscriminate results of which so delighted the Germans, they actually invented a new verb following the attack on Coventry. **coventrieren,** to devastate a city by bombing.  Shirer covers this quite well in his ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"".

So, social media is incorrect. Bomber Command did not attack first. Indeed, prior to the summer of 1940 it had mainly been dropping leaflets over Germany, laying mines or attacking shipping. The only instance prior to post-Blitz that I am aware of and could be regarded as a British strategic bombing attack was a small force that attacked some oil plants following the bombing of Rotterdam in May 1940.

As Sir Arthur Harris said ""The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everyone else, and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, and half a hundred other places, they put their rather naive theory into operation. They sowed the wind, and now they are going to reap the whirlwind.""",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FiTDF4MEo1UXBfWjctQ0twR0w3TnNyQkNQaHpoVzRSRGVKaklwVTNFX3VOT1dXSENfWnRIdi1HUHZOSDJkZHAzaGZsRDdpTUNiUFhJVTh5dFVSbG9KNlR6UzZJYjlUelJfNEhjdG05bU9nMnc9

"Thank you for taking the time to respond to me 

From what I was taught the blitz lasted 9 months, killed 40,000 civilians and severely damaged London and a dozen other cities. British didn’t start launching night time raids on strategically important German cities until 1942. I thought this was accepted as historically accurate until the Tucker clips started circling social media. 

The only thing I can ask that you left out was Germany shifting to target shipping ports and port cities in England to stop the flow of supplies. This coincides with the German navy going after shipping to try to starve England into submission but I can’t remember the admiral who screwed that up.

The argument that about England being able to damage German civilian areas to provoke the same response seemed odd and pushing their capability",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FkQUxsdWRnRWkxNE45YmRNdHZyZ3RSQUloZGFNTmpLd0Ywc05wTmotbjRTQzNOQmRPOVp4aWRFbUgza0hUS3pmS2dZQ0J4UXZZeWtkWDhNRVJOZFIxQVRyRjJlRl83RFRMeEFoWTRNXzJMUHc9

Fascinating!  The Polynesians were masterful navigators. Studies show that they interacted with Native Americans on the Pacific coast of North America around the time that the Vikings first traveled to the Atlantic Coast. At least one population of Native Americans on the NA Pacific Coast adopted a manner of constructing sea faring vessels only seen in the Polynesian islands before any Europeans made it across the land from the Atlantic.,r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FlS1dobFJPQmxndEYzNGlxeWowRlNzd2Zrb2Jrb2tqRHNibm5QaHBwcjdBLUlGUHhQT0xSQ29JSzVSTGtCRllFZzVJMTd3dzF4QjFIMjV4ZWZZckJDel9Sb2VZWGtrTlV6QmNLUXRyOUpVZ1E9

"I saw that. Interestingly, I read elsewhere that DNA science has not yet developed to the point where they have the ability to differentiate NA from SA in “Native American” genetic makeup. I think the pool of samples sequenced is not yet large enough to make a definitive distinction. 
That is not to say that if one has a sample it cannot be compared to DNA testing of individuals known to be part of a specific tribe to establish whether they are related, only that they cannot tell beyond “Native American” when a random sample is submitted for analysis.

"I had the opportunity to attend a wonderful lecture by one of the first research groups to challenge the *Collapse* story about the island.  It was really impressive how much meticulous work they had done to dig into Diamond's various claims.  Including some seriously impressive work on how the heads were carved, and some really great forensive anthropology on the question of why.

One of the points they made was that it is pretty tenuous to only look at authoritative written textual sources to  determine first European contact with the island's population.  Since it was a pretty widely accepted fact that European civilian ships would often not log every single landfall, or necessarily provide clear indications of where they had landed.

Diamond essentially argued that since there was no European contact until X year, clearly the population must have collapsed of its own accord prior to that.  But that only works if you assume that the only contact was recorded in unambiguous written textual sources.  If you question that (dubious) assumption, then it is entirely possible and even likely that earlier contact and therefore disease transmission was the main cause of population collapse.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FlYl96NlhqbDZENTdhYUF5Yk81TmlDdjR5SlV3ZkQ3LUpqcmxtTE5iSDlpaE1mVkxycG1qbkl3NlhoUElFTjFmbjZCZDBTRHd5MmVNYWRSaHRsR1lyOHc9PQ==

"The word corn is related to kernel. You can see the connection in that first syllable. If you come across the word corn in a pre 16th century context outside of the Americas, it's almost always going to be referring to a cereal grain in the context of an individual seed. The word corn was slapped onto pepper in that same type of use. A peppercorn is an individual seed of pepper. 

I'm not sure how corn came to lose that context and just be applied to maize, but I'm guessing the foreignness of the word and the difficulty English speakers have pronouncing the two vowels back to back made corn seem easier.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm02T3FleHFzdDNnT3VaSm9nZUhBUTJGc2dkUU1VVmpQSVppOFAyQ0J3YWpsRTJZdmFVNlpzeC1ib1hHSDVxalB1X0F3dE00NDFjWkJ4TXd3QlNjYUJ3QUU2SWc9PQ==

"Yes, starting around the 16th century. The reason British sailors are called limeys is b/c of the limes they carried on board to reduce scurvy. In the 19th century British sailors had a specific lime ration on their trips b/c of this. Rose's lime juice was invented for this and it's still available at most grocery stores for making gimlets.

The link between fresh fruit and scurvy was known in the 14th century, but it wasn't really a big problem until people really started sailing long distances in the 16th century. The Spanish and Portuguese recommended carrying citrus b/c of its effectiveness. The actual mechanism of scurvy wasn't discovered until the 1930s. 

Stephen Brown has a great book on the history of scurvy and talks about some of the issues, like when lime juice is exposed to light the chemical, hexuronic acid, that combats scurvy breaks down so people would drink lime juice and it wouldn't always work, which made fresh fruit uncertain as a cure. His book is just called Scurvy. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193845.Scurvy

The new David Grann book, The Wager, details the shipwreck of the Wager in the 1730s and they experience scurvy on that trip.

"Well, it's speculated that the original Maoi statues were full bodies rather than just heads, and that each one was carved to serve as the vessel for the spirits of their dead, so that they may live on as gods and use their power to protect the island from ill fortune.

The only reason we see the heads that remain today is because they were in transit from the quarries to their final destinations and left in place once things started turning bad. The completed statues out by the coast were systematically destroyed by the islanders themselves. After the first Europeans arrived, caused a ruckus, killed a few people, and left behind a disease that ripped through their population, they no longer believed that their gods truly protected them. If their giant stone guardians were nothing more than the rocks they were carved from, then their ancestors' spirits never inhabited them.

"“Brah,“ I am just telling you what I have read. I am no anthropologist and did not say you had to accept what I said as ‘proof’ of anything.

That said, it’s not as simple as claiming both had vessels for traveling on water and therefore they interacted.

"The opposite turns out more to have been the norm.  Even in the late Age of Sail it was still common to encounter fragmentary or imprecise information about various geographic discoveries in the written record -- European navigators would find themselves trying to locate islands or retrace a past landfall by piecing together different documents, parts of letters or journal accounts, or trying to make sense of rumors and legends that had been transmitted orally by sailors without much consistency.

""Do the accounts of Avery Adams and of Bartolomeo Banderas both actually refer to the same island?  And is that the island I am looking at right now out on the horizon?""  That kind of thing.

Meaning that the existence of such fragmentary information was quite typical and not at all a strange or unusual occurrence.  It is somewhat odd to have glibly decided that it was impossible a priori in this case.

"Hi everyone, I’m new to the group so please let me know if I need to change anything and sorry this is long! Do you have any books recs on recent US history?

I have a one of vague question, and figured this might be the place to ask! I find myself very fascinated with the 1940-1990ish period of American history. Specially pertaining to the Vietnam War and the cultural and political impact. I really find the music and the movies and pop culture at the time so interesting! Like how deep everything goes. I guess I feel that the feeling of innocence was more prevalent at the time? I find it hard to explain myself on this, I just find basically everything that boomers lived through interesting, and find it fascinating that they lived through so much as I’m only in my twenties. 

I want to learn more about things like recent presidents and scandals (ie; Watergate), the Kent State protests and basically just learn a little bit more about that time period. 

I know these are darker topics, but basically I’m just interested in the cultural landscape at that time: the war, music, movies and politics.

Well if you said recycle the bike/put it in the bin - That's technically illegal. The correct thing to do - Would be to throw all the rubbish scraps back into the canal...

"I’m from a particular family that, for various reasons I’ll not get into, maintains  certain documents and records and other items (a family bible with the entire genealogy written in the back through present times that goes back about a thousand years, for example, which I keep telling my cousin belongs in a particular museum in a climate controlled environment as simply the historical and cultural value to a certain country marked it priceless, but again. I’d prefer to not get into details) and trace much of our lineage and titles going back an exceptionally long time. I even wear our family signet ring (with the family crest which was used back in the day as evidentiary proof as there was a time when sealing wax with the crest pressed into it was proof of provenance, and is older than the US) which my son will receive when I pass as I did from my father. So for numerous reasons, some probably ego-driven, but some legitimate legal and other reasons I won’t discuss, we have extensive records we keep. And the European class system was very important for a very long time and it’s not that unusual for someone to be a descendant of famous historical people, kings/queens, etc., but they just don’t know it, so it’s not as special as it may sound. And much of the documents and items are kept in secure locations as well, so it’s not a situation where I can open a drawer and show someone something of historical significance, but I do have some interesting items at home that I enjoy merely having, I’ll admit. But with all of this comes some, to me, serious downsides as I don’t like the classist system that the world still enforced, knowingly and unknowingly, and some of my family I don’t even have anything to do with after severing ties as they think that having money and titles makes them better than other people, and that tribalism/classism is absurd to me.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaOVFZZ19UYTNtaGFaTmJtZnRzVVczR2RVWldxN0JoN1BfTkk0eEQyTENqZ3dpSjItX3NsS0dteE51MnBfOWhpYklGMEtKUmJ2d1hXUTVRS3RBZllSTkE9PQ==

No mention of the arrest of the Templars in 1307. This wasn’t just about the militant orders themselves but also was linked to the beginning of the Avignon papacy and the rise in power and centralization by the French kings, leading to the Hundred Years war.

Would that have been in a big chest full of silver or gold?  I'm wondering in the context of the ""Spanish Match"" King James and Prince Charles were trying to arrange with Spain, with a big motivation being a huge dowry (which James could then pay debts off with).  I haven't been able to find a value for the dowry Infanta Maria Anna of Spain actually had when she married Ferdinand III (HRE).  I just wonder how those huge dowry values got calculated.

I would at least mentioned Hussite wars - first wide-spread protestant movement, turned HRE into turmoil, led to 4 crusades, led to widespread adoption of guns (we still use words ""pistols"" and ""howitzers"", which are derived from names of Hussite weapons.

And Battle of Grunwald - largest medieval battle, whcoh led to fall of Teutonic order. Catholic Europe losr it's entire professional army here, and it could no longer use force against rising protestant movements.

It mentions founding of Iona, which - let be honest - affected just one small, relatively isolated region.

But you may be associating it with wider witch trials, which thousands died as a result of. Salem just happens to be one of the more wider known ones, mainly due to popular culture. 

You may also be confusing it with the Inquisition, which included executions for witchcraft, but that also was a lot less violent than in popular imagination.

"I don't really know that the article proves its point.

I've seen most of these before and here's the thing; The bow was already being phased out when many of the sources this article cites are mentioned. Those at the beginning that is. A few sources arguing for the bow, aren't really all that meaningful.

In WWII, there was a significant debate about how best to battle massed tank formations; deployed guns vs self-propelled guns. The US Army heavily favored deployed at first, but self-propelled guns won out. If you just randomly cited Lesley McNair, you might think the opposite but just because McNair favored deployed guns and made sensible sounding arguments in their favor, does not mean self-propelled guns didn't win that doctrinal debate.\\*

Same thing with the US army's latter debated on battle rifles vs semi-automatic rifles. Many favored the former well past the point it just didn't make sense. Their arguments weren't random or incoherent, but they were none-the-less not born out by the reality of experience at the time.

I'd also point out, in the premise, there's a bit of a switcheroo; the oft opinioned 'internet wisdom' is that guns took less *time* to train. You could call that easier, but that's not an argument that muskets took off because you could hand them to a mob and get results. This is also the point the article spends no real time debunking. It quotes a single person who I can immediately point out is not doing a very good job separating topics; the professionalization of military forces in Europe goes hand in hand with the adoption of gun, but the costs of professionalization should not be confused with the costs of arms training, nor does one strictly bear on the other.

The article kind of glosses over its own problem in this regard; 'untrained' bands of bowmen and such, in countries were weekend training on your own time was a norm, vs the state's adoption of a more direct hand in training professional troops. That they didn't have to train the former directly, would seem to be a consequence of the very laws the article brings up, not the debunking point it tries to make per se.

The OP article never actually argues this point. Instead it focuses on the economics of training, and whether or not training was important at all, which isn't the argument people repeat. I.E. The article first declares an argument is false, but then argues against a strawman instead.

The article then proceeds to make economic arguments that I don't think pan out. At least, they don't vibe with what I've read so I'm skeptical of the contextless numbers provided to argue against the strawman argument that isn't the argument the article proclaims to be debunking.

This article is a bit too fast and loose and cherry picked to really convince me the conventional wisdom is wrong. I'd also point out 3 citations at the end is not 'tons of sources.' Of the three, only one looks scholarly and its contents aren't directly addressed.

Also I swear I saw this exact post like 3 months ago on r/askhistorians almost word for word :/

"So the article compares well drilled pike and shot formations with archers that received no training for mass combat and claims that the musket harder to learn than the bow, but that's not what you're comparing at all.

"It's more likely the reason 16th century Englishmen didn't mention that it was easier to train men in firearms than bows was because every bowman came to the army pre-trained. From the perspective of military men it was harder to train arquebusiers because they were starting from scratch, whereas the archers already knew what they were doing. But that doesn't mean the overall training required wasn't greater for archers.

Any idiot could shoot a light hunting bow or crossbow, but to shoot a proper longbow took not just training for accuracy but decades of building up the right muscle groups. 

Still, I think the overall point of the article is right: ease of training wasn't a major factor in the adoption of firearms.

">the oft opinioned 'internet wisdom' is that guns took less time to train. You could call that easier, but that's not an argument that muskets took off because you could hand them to a mob and get results.

Except that is exactly what I see online arguments imply for the adoption of firearms that you could give a crossbow or gun to a mob. That is the oft repeated internet wisdom as to why firearms were adopted.

But any way you dice this argument, its presupposition is that firearms became popular because you could hand them to green troops and have them perform adequately.

What we in fact see is firearms popularized in use by long term, highly paid, career soldiers with crossbowmen fitting often into the same mold, especially as mercenaries.

Far from the weapon of rapidly trained up, green troops, they are in fact some of the most veteran and highest paid troops out on the battlefield before guns filter on down the ranks.

Of course, if you look into it, its not surprising. Just look at the  associated costs of making a crossbow or gun and maintaining ammunition. Yet despite how much more complex building long iron barrels or even just sourcing raw ingredients, let alone producing gunpowder was than bows and arrows, guns eventually became so baseline that states were willing to pay those exorbitant costs even for green troops and just barely train them on firing those weapons(three shots a year!) before they would stoop to giving them bows.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnenVvaVgzZ1V5dFhRQWJIbjROMVgzaHloWWFIUVBFNmhzUjNpbjVseUYyMUtXU1dGTWItUWFlWEFqQ1luWVVkX1NQaWxWSThpSUE0dGxxa1l2MGNZS0E9PQ==

One of the reasons people say muskets were adopted was because they were easier to learn to use (or of course physically train to use, as warbows require a very fit build and practice to be able to draw). Saying that warfare then developed to need more formational training is independent and shouldn't be considered if we're talking about the adoption of the musket as a weapon; they just aren't comparing the same things.

And if to point out again, your conflating the costs if professionalization with arms training. 

The argument I’ve seen (not on the internet mind) is that the centralization of state power plus emerging industrialization pushed the emerging Western European states toward guns because guns were easily streamlined. Their logistics came out to be more affordable long term. The expense of metal and powder was made up in the ease of mass production and transport. Standardization in troops saved costs. The state doing all of this itself gave power to the central authorities and diminished their reliance on vassals and lords for military support.

Like, I'm open to alternatives. What I know about this in Europe does not jive with what I know about the adoption of guns in Japan. In Japan what we see is very early on that that comparatively small forces of gunners had disproportionately outsized effects on the outcomes of battles. 

At Nagashino gunners were a fraction of Nobunaga's force, but aside from some mythologizing of his victory, no source contemporary or post disputes that his proper employment of firearms was what won him the battle. He had an army of at least 50,000 men. Only 1500 of them were armed with guns but those 1500 men were given most of the credit for winning.

"It's not about the training, as in how to coordinate your formations.

It's about the strength needed to shoot a heavy warbow.    That required men in good shape who regularly shot in the bow (yes, that's how you say it).   That came from practice not necessarily on the drilling grounds, but at the butts for short range shooting and by [shooting at the clout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clout_archery) for longer distance shooting.   



Now, there is one way in which this is correct:  You can teach a man in any sort of reasonable shape to be an effective military archer with a bow of, say, 50 to 60 lbs draw weight in the same amount of time it takes to train a musketeer.   This is, however, only effective against an unarmored opponent.   

If your opponents are wearing armor, or a significant number of them are, then the physics dictates you need a heavy arrow, which means you need a heavy draw weight, over 100 lbs and even as high as 150 to 200 lbs.    

Benjamin Franklin proposed during the American Revolution that the patriots should raise and train a corps of archers, and I think that would have been a pretty effective unit.  Making bows and arrows is much easier and less expensive than making a musket or rifle, the British and German troops were unarmored and wouldn't be able to get effective armor due to cost and shipping issues, so bows in the 50 to 60 lb draw weight range would have been good enough.  These archers could have opened up a galling fire upon their opponents at 200 yards, much farther than the effective range of a musket.  

I once did the math and the English Army of 1400 would have handily wiped the field of the British Army of 1800\\* because the later Army would lose a significant amount of men before they even got into a position to return fire, and the higher rate of fire of the bowmen would have made mincemeat of the musket armed troops at normal musketry ranges.  



  
*\\*Musket armed troops only.   All bets are off against Colonel Coote Manningham's Experimental Corps of Riflemen (later to become the 95th Rifles).  The reason is obvious:  Rifle armed troops trained to engage distant targets, despite their slower reload rate, could out-range longbow armed troops.  There is a good possibility to hit individual human sized targets at 200+ yards with a Baker rifle.   With a longbow, you're shooting at an area target (a mass of men) at that distance.*",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUoybFNDLS16QXZPVTVIZEpFN0kyb1VnbnNrSVNhekFxRExJVlVxV255cDJjejYzdFRHcE1JOW9mZHgtRUZaUnd1RlZPdUNUNk5GcnpqcVdfbVhFX3c9PQ==
">But if a strong man picks up a bow and shoots a couple of arrows with it is that completely ineffective?

Depends. Aiming a bow effectively is not intuitive, especially when in a high-stress situation. Like anything in combat arms, one must train. And all evidence tells us that archers needed years of training to be combat effective. 

>Most adult men of the period would probably have “farmer strength”

Maybe? Most adult men of the period were probably suffering from any number of ailments, whether from pathogens or from malnutrition. They lived hard lives. I have many relatives who work in trades, and even with modern medicine, physical therapy, and fitness routines, all of them have chronic joint and muscular issues. I have a hard time believing people of the Middle Ages didn't also struggle with this issues. 

>Surely a strong man with a bow could damage if they hit someone

Even heavy bows were struggling to be effective against armored men-at-arms by the latter half of the 15th Century. The bow was not abandoned until the 16th Century, so obviously, it had value on the battlefield, but that does not mean an arquebus was not preferable in the same context.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnYXNTb0FXUXR0bmpzWkZXMDI5OGxVR3dQTHoxTVJSLXJfS0tFZGlGYXYyaW5rb19LZjdvYnZyVHlCRnNEWUFtWkR4N2RKWTFKNjJpNGV4dXlnR0tVeEp5U1ZDOEYzczdfUWxRb3BzUWtRWTA9
"warbows were 70+, but even if we get into top weights, they still dont defeat plate.

Internet experts usually recommend 30-35 pounds for first bow, thats like Olympic bow, but it sounded way to light for me even tho i didnt know what to expect.

My horse bow still has 200+ feet per second speed, which is way faster than any longbow... modern materials, and horsebows are just built more efficiently, they have lighter limbs and preload, that pushes arrows faster.

Also every arrow needs to have straight aerodynamically shaped wood, quality glue, quality steel for tips, lots of ""moving parts"" to make a solid arrow, and still cant defeat plate. Its a logistical nightmare

With muskets you mould the lead into balls, and make powder from shit.

Thats the main reason, and killing power, which can be seen that when firearms became common, armor fell out of use, it was only retained by cavalry that went into melee, and usually only breastplate and helmet.

But in terms of operating weapon in battle, i would say musket is way more difficult than bow, because of all the fiddling with reloads, even tho they start loaded, so they have this initial effect, and bow is like slingshot, simple and easy, its actually easier to hit with a bow then with slingshot, because long shaft of the arrow gives you like mental aid where is it pointing",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMnVaWkk0Zklkdml6a1RCN2tkT0xuN2o4TVZiWlJlLXNnWngzWkpaV3U5bkpkbk5yZk01ZWNpMkpnWHJGd19yWVdEZVlRZzEtRmUwSklMY0JxQUtub3c9PQ==

">Musketeers Were Not Easier to Train than Archers

Indeed.  Back in the early 1980s when we were in jr.high, my buddy and I both got 25lb fiberglass bows from Woolworth and we were shooting them all day long in the woods out behind our homes and became very accurate shots within about a week, so *learning to accurately shoot a bow* is quick and easy.  The trick with powerful war bows (with 100+lb draw weights) is building up the muscles to draw and accurately shoot powerful bows like that but even there, it's just a case of putting in the time.

"speed is not important per se, impact power is. Try to penetrate anything with your ""200f/s"" arrows.

""built differently"" doesn't substitute power. You still need enough energy to produce harm.

Archery primarily was the hardcore physical work which required physically fit, well trained individuals. Fire arms required primarily discipline. 

  
And no you don't need ""quality clue"", quality steel etc. You need hardened  iron ""rapier"" points. Most of the European countries knew how to make them (blunt points including), there are plenty of historical examples of them, and the ammunition, being of course ever ongoing logistics problem, was never the reason for abandoning bows by the military.

I remind that they transited to more complex to produce, maintain and supply  fire arms (especially gun powder was a nightmare to produce, transport, stock and supply). Use simplicity and logistically achievable mass scale was the reason for this transition.  Another reason was legislative death of free hunting which reduced bow proficiency and  bow use ubiquity in rural population.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoeFc2MXkzb0ZzUnEyRkJCdkFmZmtRX0tkOUxtQXVOOHFGU2ZkUnpJdmRpTll5TjUwUGdidFJidVdkb012UkpQUU8tS01HbG1nd0o1Q3hNREdnSkVqRlE9PQ==

"I believe high draw weight was for those who could do it, as a sign of respect.

You know, how much do you lift bro, and those very high poundage bows were huge minority.

Bow can only push the arrow as fast as its limbs move, the benefit of draw weight in longbows,  is that such bows are slow, so they try to compensate with arrow weight. Longbow pushes, lighter, average and heavier arrow at about same speed because its limited by slow limbs.

Bows also have diminishing returns, if you thicken the limb to much, they became slower, and the top speed they get goes down, and longbows have huge disadvantage here because they are long, and long limbs means more heavy, more inertia to overcome from the start.

Dont hold me on my word, but i think all flight bows, bows that compete for distance, are light, like 40 pound craftily made horsebows, and very light arrows.

And if we get into modern compounds with pulleys, draw weight is low, yet its faster than any traditional bow

You really dont understand impact, it is mostly about speed, unless weight is too low, but average arrow travelling fast has more penetration then heavier arrow travelling slow.

Look for instance shotgun slugs, very heavy lead bullet, yet it hes trouble penetrating modern vests because its slow, while rifle has much smaller and faster bullet and goes true.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNoRFRQQklsdE9GdGxsNDJwX0pVbmRKYTdCc2tQdnRFLTV6YTY4MVBuSWZiWVNYYzR4OVZ4X2dBMWd2d2J4SXV5WXdFNjVEd04zWlRCV1FRaFFDSjlzNXc9PQ==

"I think we're agreeing here, as proofed armor was very popular in the mid/late 15th, with some armors displaying the dent where the armor was 'proven' against archers, crossbows, and later pistol and arquebus. I probably wrote it improperly before, and for that I apologize. I meant it to state that armor technology was at first foiled by harder hitting gonne, but armor eveloped to keep up until it was no longer possible/economical.

It definitely was modernization and uniformity that caused the musket to reach wider adoption, and I would state Pike as well. Standardized troops I feel is more of an eventuality in larger empires, as irregular distribution of force or irregular combat capability means that your capability to keep what you have (As a ruler) much more difficult.

"Hi!  
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.

##What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.

##But This Guy Says Otherwise! 
Unfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as ""Revisionists"", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *""entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.""*

It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.

##So What Are the Basics?  
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.
First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.

The early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. 

By early 1942, the ""Final Solution"" to the so-called ""Jewish Question"" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.

Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  ""Reinhard"" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.

##The Camps  
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as ""extermination through labor"". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and ""allowed"" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.

Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.

The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.

Several camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.

##How Do We Know?  
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

">I have literally never seen anyone present it that way.

Then you haven't done much looking around.

>is that the centralization of state power plus emerging industrialization pushed the emerging Western European states toward guns because guns were easily streamlined.

This flies in the face of mass adoption of firearms by groups that were notably not centralized and very much not industrialized, not the least of which are Native American tribes in the 1600s who oft bemoaned being reliant on trade for firearms.

> The expense of metal and powder was made up in the ease of mass production and transport.

This frankly seems extremely dubious as a ""primary"" reason for firearm adoption. I mean, not the least of which by the time we get to line infantry in the early 1700s, they would in fact be adding additional supply chains as pikes and swords were converted to more musketeers.

Hell, Europe didn't just *randomly* happen into craft producing firearms on such scale to equip entire armies. The demand came first, and the production substantially after such demand started. Nor did anybody else who began mass equipping armies with firearms.

>guns cane out cheaper and their training to an adequate level was less time consuming than other arms,

Again, this is pretty dam dubious that drilling pikemen was more complex than drilling matchlock musketeers whose weapons could explode or unexpectedly go off if handled wrong.

This all round about nonsense seems like its just trying to ignore the straight forward answer that in fact a big metal tube firearm held substantial benefit over other weapons that eventually militaries of all stripes prioritized them over basically all other arms just to compete.

Again, just consider the many, many native American tribes that went through the extreme trouble and supply issues firearms and only fell back on bows and arrows they could actually supply themselves when they needed to.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpbnhqZHRnamEwWHBiakh4ekMxZGdVU3UtLTM1WFJRV3h4Z0NDQ3p2UkJYR2dUekRseDN3a0VjUjUyVjdHVlJ5dEo0N3hQNXF5R0RncHFLRlg4dnFBekE9PQ==
"Armour of proof goes out into the *17th* century, and its decline ties into, first the far larger, mercenary/bandit armies of the time, and shifts from quality to mass-production manufacturing in an economically devastated central Europe.
Second, Gustavus Adolphus achieves stunning wins with high-speed, aggressive cavalry that eschew firearms and heavy protection (just as well, strong horses became hard to find)
I think this course is locked in at the battle of Roundway Down during the English Civil War; his Parliamentarian cavalry have superlative armour and plenty of firepower, and aim to fight defensively in column against the thin and wide Cavalier formation charging Swedish style at top speed.
Haselrig's men were swept from the field almost instantly, despite being impossible to kill.

"Hey!

I'm curious about illegitimate children through history.

How was it that so-called 'bastards' and 'illegitimate heirs' were not simply denied by their fathers? Like, if there is no DNA testing, couldn't a man of status/wealth simply say a child was not his?

As I understand it, and could be wrong, it seems like children were sometimes acknowledged, but not officially accepted... why acknowledge them at all?

I hope my question makes sense. I'm really keen to understand better.

Edit: missed the word 'not' in the first sentence.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpNjNDTFZZZ29DbDZfZ1I0ckFzV3NvWjdLN0lXbWR2WGl6N2lWMFRJVG1iVl91aFZKeHdPem0yS1RYSXE5TVp3eF9lbDcwb0xfVnhoNmRaNHVuTDVjTlE9PQ==
"I mean, basically, yeah. 

It's going to depend a lot more on the culture, the cultural norms, and the laws, though. 

Spartans may have practiced polyandry (one woman, multiple ""husbands""), which has been argued by Pomeroy and, I believe, Cartlidge to have allowed for younger men to father children, but for all children to be raised by all of the male familial lines since no one could tell who was the father, which gave the kid, and the woman, better social status. 

In other cases though, wanting to be sure it was your child was a factor, and without any way to determine otherwise it was pretty easy for a denial to take precedence considering the male dominated nature of most societies.  

Then of course you bring in cultural/religious norms, where bastard children might not be seen the same as others. For example, Pericles of Athens initiated a citizenship law that required future Athenian citizens to have both male and female citizens for parents for them to gain the same. This was controversial in its time among other Athenians, but it showed an awareness of this even in antiquity. Funnily enough, Pericles' two legitimate sons died early, so he was able to get his illegitimate son (also named Pericles), who was not born to an Athenian mother, made a citizen despite the law that he had passed. The younger Pericles would later be executed, but for unassociated reasons (other than the fact that if he was not a citizen he couldn't have been in the position which led to his execution, but that's a stretch). 

But with other cultures/religions, especially when you bring in children out of wedlock and the Abrahamic associations, there's another level of complication. People want to present themselves in one way, but people have always done things that aren't perfect or that aren't the way they hope to present themselves. So there's both the social relationship you have with the state, and society, but the relationship you have with your family, and your children, as well. These don't always align. 

An extreme case of this later example might be Strom Thurmond. Thurmond was, even in his own time, a pretty big racist. When he was 22 he had sex with a 16 year old black girl who worked for his family, and she gave birth to his daughter. He never spoke about it publicly during his life, but supported her (somewhat) financially. He had his social obligations, his cultural obligations, his financial obligations (i.e. his job as a politician), but also his familial/sanguinis obligations, and did recognise her as his daughter, even if it would be very troublesome towards his other parts of his life if this was ever revealed. 

As for why one might recognise, but not fully acknowledge, an heir... it again might come down to culture and law. This is particularly noteworthy in history when we look at rulers/kings/emperors, etc. in systems where the person who replaces them is a son or daughter. Some of these require that person to be, just like Pericles' law, of both parents who both have a certain bloodline. Those who are born out of this compact might be acknowledged, might be given other positions, and supported, and maybe even loved, but they cannot be king or queen. The same may be the  case for inheritance. These laws are largely archaic in modern terms, though I'm sure inheritance lawyers would probably be able to discuss some difficulties that still exist, but when we look at cultural norms and practices they can impact things even that the highest power in the country can't easily bypass (e.g. the abdication of Edward VIII of the United Kingdom who gave up the throne when it was clear he couldn't marry a divorcee without causing a significant problem. He could absolutely have done it, and told everyone to fuck off, essentially, but there was a cultural expectation, and social expectation, and he opted to not cause that disruption). 

I hope I've helped instead of just rambling at you.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpQk5vTEFOOFQ2LUY1b1FvR3dvcWRialVCMVEzYjYzVjJmbnU3WmxsZ1hBSTE5ZWVqeXF2WFA5UjBCWGRxdnBISzA5Q25HS1ZON2wwRjlPZ1RnRnhfTXc9PQ==

"If you're a King, you probably had an arranged marriage.  Depending on the marriage customs of your culture, you may not be able to have additional wives or official concubines, but lots of monarchs had unofficial mistresses.  Children from those relationships would be illegitimate, but the monarch might be happy to acknowledge them, as children he had with someone he might actually like?  There's also things like persons in officially celibate occupations where they couldn't officially get married.  Pope Innocent VIII had some of his children's weddings held right in the Vatican. It really depended on the situation, but in Europe, legitimacy was very important for inheritance purposes, so they wanted to keep track, but not necessarily completely disown illegitimate children.  It depended on the individuals and the customs in question.

"It's true for rifles, but not for muskets.   A ball from a musket aimed at the figure of a person will strike the ground a bit past 100 meters, and musket armed troops were not trained to aim at distances by applying what we would today call ""Kentucky elevation"".   In fact, a typical musket armed soldier might only fire half a dozen real shots during training.   And they were in fact told to aim low to counteract the tendency to aim over the heads of their opponents.

[I was just looking at a table of some musketry tests done in Austria with original muskets and using a target that was 5.5' tall and 1' wide at 100 meters.](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/article/view/17669/22312)  They hit the target an average of 54.2% of the time.

However, it's not actually a good test of practical accuracy in the field:

*The guns were mounted on modern fixed frames (to absorb recoil), sighted on target, ignited electrically (bypassing their original firing mechanisms), and their bullets were tracked and measured electronically.*

Had they pulled people off the street, given them at most a couple hours training, and conducted the test again, that hit rate would have been much, much lower.  Perhaps as low as the single digits percentage-wise.   Maybe even zero.

Which would square with this quote from Colonel George Hanger written in 1814:

*""A soldier's musket, if not exceedingly ill-bored (as many are), will strike a figure of a man at 80 yards; it may even at a hundred; but a soldier must be very unfortunate indeed who shall be wounded by a common musket at 150 yards, providing his antagonist aims at him; and as to firing at a man at 200 yards with a common musket, you may as well fire at the moon and have the same hope of hitting him. I do maintain and will prove€¦that no man was ever killed at 200 yards, by a common musket, by the person who aimed at him.""*

Rifle armed troops are different.   They are trained to shoot at distant targets\\*, and their weapons are built to specifically allow for that.

The reason why guns replaced bows is that the armor got better, to the point where even the most fit person couldn't draw a bow capable of piercing that armor.   Guns don't require the upper body strength that bows require, and increasing their armor penetration is a matter of increasing the velocity and/or mass of the projectile.

Because guns came into common use and their ability to penetrate even the best armor increased, armor fell into disuse because it was heavy, expensive, and didn't protect like it did during the waning days of the warbow.

Which ironically made bows a practical solution once again, but militaries tend to be conservative.  They don't like radical change unless it's forced upon them.   It's said that every piss-ant regulation has been written in blood, and while that's not 100% true, there is a lot of truth to it.  The idea of going backwards technologically, while it might occur to an out-of-the-box thinker like Benjamin Franklin, and while it may have been a sound, practical idea, no military person is going to accept that, because of training and often experience.

*\\*Or in early rifle armed units, they were professional hunters who brought their own weapons to use in military service and were familiar through long use how they shot at long range.   This is also why almost all military rifles didn't have bayonets until the Baker rifle.   Aside from the Ferguson rifle and the rifles of the Hesse-Hanau Freikorps, no rifles had bayonets during the American Revolution, even purpose built military rifles like the*",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNpZXlFaFRRZ09zbEROX2h2ZGFVVFRKNUIya3VzYlBaVWhuVUM3X3YtM2tWd1NDOTk0azBfZ2pCYTBsbEZTaHE5TEJYbUFET3BzODQweURaZHpSaXNPQUE9PQ==

Archaeologists in Bulgaria have discovered a nearly seven-foot-tall marble statue of Hermes, the Greek messenger god, in an ancient sewer in the city of Heraclea Sintica.

* It was likely placed in the sewer after a devastating earthquake in 388 C.E. to preserve it during the rise of Christianity.

* The statue will be moved to the History Museum in Petrich for restoration and public display.

"Last night I finished **Bismarck's War: The Franco-Prussian War and the Making of Modern Europe by Rachel Chrastil**

4.5/5. (I rounded down on Goodreads but that was a harsh decision)

It's very good. Covers the military details well, explains the political situation in detail and also provides a lot of info on the suffering of the civilian population. The motivations of people involved, the leaders, soldiers and civilians are also presented in a very clear way.

The author tries to show the parts of the way the Franco-Prussian war had similarities to the 20th century and the world wars - mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of men, the blurring of lines between civilian and military, the devastation caused by new weaponry. The author does a pretty good job at this. There's a chapter dedicated the humanitarian intervention to ease the suffering of the civilian population, as this didn't really happen much in earlier wars like the American Civil War.

This is the first book I've read specifically about the Franco-Prussian War. One thing I found surprising was how, at least in the early days of the war, how close the battles were and how many casualties the Germans took. If the French leadership had been a bit more competent and aggressive things may have turned out differently. When the war is mentioned in more general overview history books it is normally presented as the Germans absoluting dominating France with ease.

It's not a light read. It's about 400 pages and pretty much jumps straight into the action. It doesn't provide that much in the way of background context so I'd only recommend it you already know a bit about European history the in 1800s. If you do want a book specifically about the Franco-Prussian War I'd highly recommend it though.

"Couldnt post this so I'm posting it here

Why does it seem like Russia has always had terrible governments and incompetent rulers?

My father served in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and has plenty of stories to tell me about how incompetent the Soviet chain of command was - always putting soldiers in unnecessary danger and harm, doing things that would be unheard of in the US military. And outside of conflict, a plethora of stupid policies, and a lack of common sense in soviet leadership. Looking further into history, I can see this with the Tsars before the Soviets as well.

So why is this? Why is it that Russian governments are constantly terrible in their own ways? It seems like an endless cycle of uprooting and changing a government, then basically becoming as authoritarian and oppressive as the previous one.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNqVnFkLTBrZWg5bmZoSEZ6Z0M3X1ZHLTJpZnNvNzYwQ2J6QUhjbXFqRFlfUDhnSXRUV2xtc0NGV3FweWNtVENWTlBKd29TUTA2YW5LbHFOTjE5bDJieTBiYzNxVmJxbURTbk81c0NaUWw1VUk9

">You can use the same arrows over and over

Maybe when training, but in combat a lot of these arrows could be damaged when they hit armour or other hard surfaces. 

Arrows also take heck lot more effort and time to make than lead bullets. As an amateur fletcher, it takes me maybe an hour of cumulative time to turn a square pine shaft blank into a traditional fully fletched and tipped arrow. And I didn't have to forge the arrowhead. 

A master fletcher back then could probably do it in a fraction of the time, but I doubt he would be faster than someone casting a big batch of lead round balls with a multi-cavity mold. 

>building the strength required doesn't even need a bow.

As an amateur archer, I also disagree with this statement. Drawing a bow uses a different set of muscles than saying lifting or carrying weights. When I started I could barely pull back a 30 lb recurve bow despite having spent my college summers roofing where I regularly carried and tossed around 60-80 lb bundles of shingles.

"That's a strut, a supporting structure. As they carve the marble away, struts are often in between gaps and are slowly filed down as they go. If the artist decides that structure is needed even in the finished piece the strut will remain. Sometimes this is hidden, and later art tended to try and hide it as best they could (there's a reason there's a lot of stuff happening at the bottom of a lot of marble statues, tree trunks, snakes, etc.) but this wouldn't have been a huge deal. Romans would later be very well known for leaving struts in, but as this shows it was also a Greek practice as well. 

If you google ""Struts Roman Art"" and ""Struts Greek art"" you can see more examples of this, some hidden much better than others.

Edit: I should also note that it's not uncommon to have struts digitally removed from statues in textbooks and museum guides.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNrcXFKcTl5ZktEcUJDQWlKMnVfdjQwSnpWaEpuSUFfNnM0dkR2TEVyYlQyM2g1NEFwdGw0anBuM2tfQzdjQ3VDQkdqa3ZmcXNiTHlKcVJZV3pnN012bGc9PQ==

"By the 1500s, a good handgun - in Holland at least - could be had for the same price as *the windlass* for a heavy crossbow. 

Thirty-one *harquebuses* (a heavy caliber matchlock ""hook gun"" usually meant for siege defense) were purchased by the Dutch city of Gouda in 1508 for 25 stuivers each. That same year the nearby city of Leiden purchases a few dozen *knipbossens* (smaller-caliber arquebus-style matchlock more suited for field use) that included a kit of powder horn, priming powder, slow match fuses, etc. for 51 stuivers per gun+kit set. In general, handguns in the region were usually priced between 20-30 stuivers each.  

In comparison, longbows could be purchased for 14 stuivers per hundred bows. Which is pretty cheap, but then if we look at the cost of arrows for arming the bows, they too were priced at 14 stuivers per hundred. A single arrow literally cost as much as a bow at this point. Crossbow bolts were even more expensive at 42 stuivers per hundred bolts.

The price of lead for the same place & period, was 42-52 stuivers for a hundred pounds of scrap lead (often sourced from used bullets scavenged from training ranges or battlefields), or 75-125 stuivers for a hundred pound of fresh lead ingots. One pound of lead could be cast into 25 bullets for a .58 cal arquebus, so a hundred bullets not counting the cost of labour will cost maybe 5 stuivers at most to make, and less than 2 stuivers if using discounted scrap lead. 

*Knip* or arquebus-quality gunpowder could be purchased at 4-8 stuivers per pound. Assuming 140 grains of powder is needed for one shot, 2 lbs of powder would be sufficient for 100 shots for an arquebus and cost about 8-16 stuivers.

So roughly speaking, in early 16th century Holland you could reasonably outfit an arquebusier with basic gear and 100 rounds of ammunition for about 60-80 stuivers, and a longbow archer with 100 arrows for about 30 stuivers. The startup cost for outfitting the gunner under this scenario is about double that of the archer, which is a lot but not outrageous. Especially given the latter had a better chance of killing armoured targets and a contemporary crossbowman's gear & munition would had cost about the same or more. Ammunition-wise, bullets & gunpowder cost were similar or somewhat less than arrows for every hundred shot. 

Note the early-1500s is still pretty early on in the adoption timeline for European firearms, and as with many new technologies, its cost will drop significantly in the future as firearms are more widely used and produced.

>Plus practicing with a gun at that time was also probably not something most would want to do, given their propensity to blow your hands and or face off!

The upper and middle class citizens of the aforementioned Dutch cities had ""shooters guilds"" (*schutterij*) where members of the militia met regularly to shoot and train with their weapons. 


1. A Dutch stuiver is equivalent to 2 English pence of the same period, or nominally worth about a gram of silver during 1500-1600.

Source: *Prices of Weapons and Munitions in Early Sixteenth Century Holland During the Guelders War* - James P. Ward",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyVlZmbVJ3QzZtMlc2QzBUeVkyaFZ4WGlhaFNETkdpcTVoZ0l4UDhLSXJuelloUkJCRHZwZ21ENTdxZEFIUUMwMHRmTUpaRXVzVm1XakhURHBGZTNxU29iMHhCYWE0ak9MQWJnY2RwZlBRMEk9
"That all sounds reasonable to me. Based on a cursory reading of history of these guilds, men were expected to supply their own weapons, and it appears to be the wealthiest men who were members.

That suggests to me at least that cost is still a factor here. Training a hundred shots for an archer might cost you a few broken arrows, although you might be using practice arrows for precisely that, so the cost of continual practice is relatively low. Training with a firearm is a constant and ongoing thing. One presumes they are refusing lead, but it still seems to me archery was still a much cheaper weapon to train on and in general much cheaper to deploy, given that you could collect most arrows and heads too.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyVW56ZVNBWDNwY0lLeXFPWHNnaG5MNWRxTk5FMDdYWXZxaGNhYktMd0xVaGpZYTdtdGVkcEprYmxmWkQ1TFlUSWJaUWIxbkg1MEVHc1EtZHdueXJxOUNTb3B2SmdaeGhBaG9JUzM0YU02NEE9
"I think the article is not very convincing as it does not take into *full* account the *physical requirements* to use a war-bow effectively.

That is, the *time* it takes to build up the strength to be able to use a bow effective for battle. That is something that cannot be done in two weeks.

So while an individual could learn the ins-and-outs of using the bow *or* the musket in a certain period of time, that time could make him an effective shooter but *not* an effective bowman if he lacked the necessary muscle.

Training a musketeer *was* easier in that sense because he would emerge in a state where he could use the weapon and function *fully* as a soldier if they had no prior experience. The same is not true of an archer if they had not spent their life practicing the bow.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyUnlOUGN4RkFzNlFTbjBSRThnZVhIX256eHNLcFYySWowSmNwSUZzWk82eHRndUxpaGhEWDgxVGZreG5QUUw1OWpTX2M4ZzJFR0dXVkhyZ3lfdDJKZ0ZkcnpDOUFsMVk2cW03aUJ0cnFmbU09
"Your remark about hunting triggered this response. One important factor in favor of the musket is that increasing population densities and deforestation made access to recruits with already existing basic fletching and hunting skills harder. That would weigh in favor of lead bullets.

For longbows deforestation in itself was for certain a major issue. Poland, the HRE, and England regulated the trade in Yew wood because of it. Great bows were becoming very expensive.

I've seen a similar skills factor cited as the main consideration for the decision to motorize cavalry units after WWI: Access to rural conscripts with basic horse riding skills reduced, while the number of urban conscripts with driving licenses and experience as mechanics was growing. So with mass mobilization in mind it was a financially prudent move to motorize instead of massively scaling up horse riding education.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNyR2s5SUY1Mzh0bEQwOVUtRVhsazZsdjViMGZUUzBMZFBVQXd5OThsVklVYnR3SlpSSU1FVEs0SFlyNkJQZVFtVzM0ME8wMTBuNnFKSHBUZEY0S1YzbENuSnF1RXpLcFRZWEZlQXJRNWdXekk9

"It's pretty much impossible for historians to measure ""terrible"" or ""incompetent""

We also have to consider bias. If your father served, and (presumably) emigrated, he may harbour some less than pleasant memories of the Soviets. Similar to how people in the US might view their politicians as terrible, or incompetent, based on not much. You're also going to find a lot of propaganda (against both sides) due to the Cold War and wanting to depict each other as negatively as possible. 

But, from a non-historical sense, there have been a lot of people that were more or less generally considered bad at what they did in the US military too.  In fact, I doubt you could find a state with enough evidence for its politics and politicians where you wouldn't find this. So I'd be careful painting it as a ""place problem"" vs a ""politics problem"" or even a ""bias issue"" as one politicians incompetence can be read as a big plus by another, especially in democratic societies.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN0VXpGRENTSVAxNHQ1MVE0X3VPUGZSTEV0S253WjlWZlJGUTNCZWJWOGtXSjR6UDFVa2FfZzI3cjloVDA2SjgtNzh1SVhYaFZJZVpWcmRzXzFjUC1ubEE9PQ==

"The accusers in the Salem Witch Trials were women and girls, but it's still misogyny because... help me out here... because it was men who enabled the system that the women and girls took advantage of to kill people they disliked?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2NkozZWJhZE5NR1R4ajRLWDF4emV5aFNXSmsxQ1hEYmxTS0xHYzA2enc2WDNzTkotZzU5a2FvMmFJQms1NDNLcTVwTWFhT3JYemlMTng4d3RGYUNrMUE9PQ==
"Hello, I have a very specific request and was wondering whether you could help me with it.

I'm looking for books or articles (reputable, preferably academic) detailing the domestic life of Polish bourgeoisie/nobility/aristocracy in late 19th and early 20th century. Something that would tell me about how these families lived, how children were raised in wealthy (or aristocratic) families, what they were expected to learn, how the sons were treated compared to the daughters, what role did the governess play, etc., etc.

Alternatively, if it turns out that there were no marked differences between Polish bourgeoisie and other European bourgeoisies, I'm looking for anything that would go into detail about how they lived, what they were taught, etc.

Thank you.",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2RldrcmlVY0E5YVFsbG9jRlpqVU9GOERPWmJKa0g4alNkaUVySWtyT2hVRTBqTUtMeWVuUzNHOGpIQ05naU5vaUUwYXZ5QVhoQlF2ajM0R0xpN2RHaUE5RHJ6WVJ3LTFBcV84a2t6MEY4alk9

"I have addressed your question, and I'm guiding you towards an understanding. 

By perpetrators do you mean accusers? Jurors? Judges? Executioners? 

And again, part of the issue is because you're only looking at 19 of the victims, which is 0.03% of all accusations which led to executions. You are focusing on a ridiculous small portion. 

And, again, why do you think women would accuse other women? What does that tell us about societal issues? What sort of society were women in Salem living in? What were their rights? Furthermore, what motivations might they have for accusing others when people are going around accusing women?",r/history,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGN2cmlQLTl5ZFluSm43WkRSZEJFbXN3VmFfX2F6VllzRndFekF1Q2phRjIxQUFmQmpUUFl3LXl3RHdHcEp5MVlQb241TVM2Z1REajJTTXQ0X2JYZ2U3d1E9PQ==
