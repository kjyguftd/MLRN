No there are rules to war. Back then people used to fight on BATTLEFIELDS not on civilian grounds bombing innocent people’s houses. I kinda wish that we were back in the sword era because war was much less damaging to civilians than it is now.

The general public does not care because all prisoners must be bad.  Even if you do care, how do you replace a free workforce in the millions with a manufacturing power of billions per year?

This guy WAS NOT sentenced for being atheist. His sentence was for criticising Islam. There are some strict law governing criticism of RELIGION, not just Islam. It equally applies to criticism of Christianity and Judaism too. The law is tied to attempts to instigate sedition, given that in countries such as Egypt (Arab Republic), or various other Muslim countries (that are Islamic Republics), their daily life and laws are informed by and tied closely to religion. Taking religion out of it, for example, if there were proven seditious intent in many other countries, that is also linked with heavy penalties and potential jail time under the banner of national security.

"> This includes democratic countries, including the USA, where recommend sentences vary from 5-20 years. It’s disappointing the amount of BS being shared.

people are not imprisoned in the united states for criticizing religion (or government) and conflating sedition with criticism of anything is a logical fallacy at best.

even if you want to conflate them though, recently the united states had a little seditious event of its own. none of the people involved were charged with sedition or criticizing anything. criminal charges included: assault on peace officers and media, destruction of government property and trespassing in restricted areas.

"No, this isn't human trafficking. Legally, human trafficking generally refers to forced labor or sex work.

As for whether it is open adoption, that definition varies by state. And at the time of this case, Nevada didn't have a law addressing it. The common understanding of what ""open adoption"" is doesn't particularly matter here.

The case summary makes clear that the mother tried to breach the contract and reverse the adoption. That's against the contract she signed (aka a breach of contract). Then the adoptive parents decided against letting her see the kid, which is also a breach of contract. But the judge decided that the clause about visitation was unenforceable because Nevada doesn't have a law expressly protecting open adoption. Note that the dissenting judge in the case thinks that the lack of law isn't a barrier to enforcement.

Hope this is helpful.

Also why was the agency allowed to misrepresent and mislead the birth mother with a contract they knew was not enforceable. The only reason would be to close their sale on their side.

"I focus so much on human trafficking I just assumed that's what you meant! I'll edit my post.

The types of crimes you mention above are indeed forms of trafficking, each under their own name. However, smuggling people across borders is smuggling — it becomes human trafficking if it's for purposes of exploitation (labor/sex work).",r/humanrights,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJvcGd4Q3NxdWl5ZEpCS3RwV2ROSFhHMk5FMnFid2FkSFRvOEJ1cGw4WmcxcDV6ZEtsLXR3UzRYU3dwVXFpVThEZlFtV3lsLXVVWXN4aUhTek1mU2ZSYnc9PQ==
"They didn't necessarily know it was unenforceable, I didn't see that mentioned (although I admit I skimmed it). As the dissent shows, a judge could have ruled the other way. You'd have to look for other precedent to see if the agency had reason to believe it would be unenforceable.

It also seems that the reason for the adoptive family stopping communication was the fact that the birth mother tried to reverse the adoption. Up until that point, they had complied with the communication provisions. 

So, because there had been some communication as per the contract, it doesn't seem that the agency intended to mislead the birth mother. 

This is a case of a woman getting cold feet after adopting out her child and then losing all access probably because the adoptive family was concerned for the welfare of the child (speculative).

"I have experience and have heard others that this has happened to. So on the birth family side there was no issues. They go in having open adoption promoted to them. Then after the adoption is finalized are told by adoptive parents they want to end contact.

"The way I understand it is , if the birth mother tried backing out or not why was the contact agreement not apart of the adoption decree. You would think the agency would be familiar with the laws if they are a licensed agency to adopt.

"I am sorry to hear you have experience with this. This area of law is clearly underdeveloped, which makes it easy to take advantage of people.

It does seem fraudulent and coercive, yes. Although I do also think it is relevant that the birth mother tried to reverse the adoption before communication was cut off.

"I am focusing on the fraudulent and coercive side of the article when it states that the agencies are allowed to make their own contracts. I don’t see how it is legal to mislead a birth family.

By the time they get to court and are told it is too late and they lose them , is very wrong and I do see this as legal trafficking.

Having heard from other families that experience the fraudulent contracts, state that they do think this is legal kidnapping and trafficking.
