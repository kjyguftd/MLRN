"Hello.  I'm terribly sorry to hear this happened to you.  There is help available and lots of people who have similar stories.  You are not alone.

Trafficking doesn't have to have a component where the victim is paid.  In many cases the victim is never paid or given anything, just used for the gain of the trafficker.  You don't need any proof persay of the fact you were trafficked. 

In this case I would suspect it is possibly Trafficking as they brought you to someone else for the purpose of sexual interaction and abuse.  Some very strong indicators in what you described of Trafficking.  

Please do ensure you keep reaching out for help.  I wish you the best in your journey.",r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2TDBxZzZnR2hNRl9HT0ZaaUh1azZFTXd2bUJzdGNMOUR6WDI5VXg5LUwwNFo4RHZoVEt2ejN0QUlacFVvOC10N0lwMG9zYzdMbU5XUDYtZFVBLThCd2VSWTFqZGZDaHBfSS1hMTJVV3NTbFU9

"Many multiple years ago I was almost a victim of Human Trafficking luckily they caught not long after attempt w me while jogging to improve my running times for MilitaryPhysical. Due to inherited health issue I didn’t get in. 
But, within two years of that attempt of someone trying to kidnap and traffic me I became a life long advocate for Anti-Human Trafficking and Knowing the dangers and safety protocols to NOT be a victim of them or Sexual Predators in our own communities. I’ve been a Volunteer Advocate and Missing and Murdered Persons Advocate for over 40 yrs. 

Please don’t use the term as an endearing one. Much of the time these are not “Boyfriends” never were, they were and are simply those playing a Role what they are called are Predators and Traffickers or Scouts in a sense they lure, groom and get young girls, boys, teens and adults women and even men to trust them. Buy them expensive items, even meet family members do same w them, get the family comfortable or lure the victims in by refusing meet family, only seeing them when no one is around, etc They then get the one targeted or try to leave their homes in middle of day or night or kidnap them from public places w barely anything. Check on your kids especially at night and late at night to make sure they are home safe and not having snuck out for what they believe may be a few mins or hours. 

Sometimes they are told not even change clothes by telling them “oh don’t worry I bought you stuff or we will go shopping” in reality no necessities means it’s harder to leave w inadequate clothing/shoes no money or way to contact anyone. By the time they are put into any vehicle their rate of survival goes down from 100% survival rate to 50% immediately and if missing over three days even less of chance of being found alive. 

It can take less than 5 mins w Trafficking cells to get a victim and once they’ve been taken it can be months, years or decades until they are found alive IF found alive. 
Once they have them in vehicle they lure and groom them some more for a few days pretending love and they are a couple. Then either pass them off to a Buyer/Boss or they have a very nasty client come in and the girls or boys are r——- and abused until they do exactly what they are told. If don’t they are tortured, starved and SA’ed repeatedly until they do what they are expected to do. Sadly most are brainwashed to believe they cannot escape. 

Know who your kids/teens and adult children’s friends are, who they talk to, who’s giving them problems at school or in neighborhoods. Monitor their Internet use, know who they talk to and chat with. Monitor their cell usage and apps especially ones they may hide or have instant messaging like SC. Predators of all levels will use these methods to lure and get to kids having problems at home. Use cameras around your home and set alarm systems at night change passwords often especially if have problems with kids sneaking out at night. 

The atrocities of Human Trafficking happen to girls, boys, teens, women, men, special needs, immigrants entering legally or illegally and LBTQ etc every day in any town, city, state or country all over the world. There is a special place in 
H E L L for anyone Trafficking anyone anywhere in the world. Look at the statistics for Trafficking and it is estimated it will make more illegal money in the world than Drug Trafficking within the next 3-5 yrs. Let these statistics sink in when you look them up. The billions of dollars of those believing they have the right to SELL other people. 

It can happen to any child, teen or adult in any corner of the world. Trafficking is done by family members, fake family friends, fake friends setting them up usually someone new someone has met recently, teachers, LE, people in all communities you’d never think would do such evil things. A trafficker can be a neighbor, a coworker, the guy who bartends or the guy who funny jokes in neighborhood bars in Touristy Towns or Cities. Know who your kids talk to in and around schools and neighborhoods going to school and walking home or on buses etc

Be vigilant keep your inner circle small. Always be prepared and protected at all times. Take Self Defense Classes if someone tries to take you in a store make the biggest a—- mess possible. Grab sprays and chemicals off shelves put them between you and those trying to take you. Use whatever, however to get attention from others. Scream Fire, Rape or Call 911 They Are Trying to Assault & Kidnap me! Cuss at them, scream at them the more scene you make the more people will take notice. Use your phone to video them discreetly or send photos to family member or friend and ask them to come to store or call 911 immediately! Send info as much as possible on what they look like, wearing etc

Never act like a victim, don’t be distracted by your cellphones, if comfortable w self defense weapons learn to use them & carry them, don’t be digging in your bags, backpacks, distracted etc and keep your kids and family members close to you no matter what! 

Be vigilant, observant and if you see something SAY something call the police, create a scene inside or outside  to keep anyone targeting others children, teens or women and men. Honk your horn repeatedly, get tag numbers, car descriptions, physical descriptions as much info as possible to give to LE. Call them or you can report anonymously to their Department Web Sites w the information many may be repeat offenders or groups. Post online in Missing Forums the information will be networked. 

If anyone tries to take you FIGHT kick, scream, bite, claw eyes, punch throat, kick in private areas male or female and keep moving & fighting to get free run back into store, scream for Police or jump in car lock doors and honk horn continuously until they leave the majority will not stick around. Never let anyone get you in a trunk or backseat. If you carry self defense weapons you are fighting for your life use them. Wear heavy metal rings when going out by yourself ones than can rip and tear skin and leave serious marks or break nose or bones in face. 
Always be aware of your surroundings and who is near you at all times if alone or with your kids, family members or friends.",r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNEQm5zQWc5QmZvWGhjTy1UdXZkZnM2bHJXdzN4V0luLVBOV0Q4U0ppZTUzd182MGFVMDI3czR3cDVHcUFrZTFEQlhYaE9yZXZlTjZkemxzWEt0dmZVVDg4N3Z0ZjNlQXpTTE5yaEFUNzhaV1k9

How many traffickers themselves are employed directly by these government organizations?

How bad does it have to get before they help, and why won't they help when people report the grooming process? I shouldn't have to be forced to turn tricks before they help me, otherwise they're likely complicit in digital enjoyment of the abuse, and don't want to lose their free captivity porn.

I was advised to take the focus off of him, so I haven’t asked if she’s still talking to him. Fortunately, I haven’t seen any signs that she is.",r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYOVI5UE5Ia1FKX2dPTWthSDRXNndpZXhMN293N0hyXzR2RlZ3RFZDV2lYbDdEZEdHSGROT3BUb1ZOd1NOYi1MZi04eU1pZ1Vkdzc4eWsxQ0VYU0dVZDMwNWlZSlNmYkNkeFdrT1Q1bmxXNjQ9
Him telling her that she doesn’t have to work pretty much tells you all you need to know. Glad she is safe.,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYSjNwRzZob3d1R2JjbzQtcUlCd3R4aHFnaE91cDYtSHZXX3RJMFZIX3BqampBcGtIaU5WeUNjNWJhcmNzWFZnRm1ocFd0OVRVMGExc2JPQW9uZWZlWnVGNVRfam9NaWp5ZjRIQnBnYnoxMDA9
No it's a religious thing.,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYQTdkUlFRb2g1eHgtWEpnclB1Uk0yVVFzRGFKcXFJd3BYOVU5bzU0TmZVRktNX25YN2VfS0V5d21YV2ZGbHhJVDMyaWEwaDgxQW8xZWJvV2w5RnlLRnc9PQ==
"You might want to speak with a therapist about this. You are bordering on creating a conspiracy theory, and if I were you I'd be worried more about having paranoia than about trafficking.

Being cautious in unfamiliar situations is good, but yourself anxiety because of unrelated incidents is going to cause you more harm.",r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNENJYXRhcUIzY0t5b3RWVkNqcUdWZ2lTeEdjcGh6QjIzQzEtZzFONkhZcWg5ME5BakRBcTE2YW9mQzRBeVp3d2lZZERtcHBUbW05RmstUFNGYjd4cnc9PQ==
Okay I’ll talk to a therapist about this. Reading this from someone else’s perspective it doesn’t look good. Thank you for pointing that out!,r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNm5jNENBcF82eFkxZHdlclkydXVyLTIyYkVTaERVbEY5MzZMYldHdFNEQkNncVpINGN1SzI4bkpOTGctelJZNVY2Z3I2NEt0eGRWcV9QWGFsR0ZwT0E9PQ==
"We've all been there, sometimes things feel weirdly off for no reason other than that we slept poorly or didn't eat a proper breakfast! Everyone can benefit from talking to a therapist though, and I'm pretty sure this is exactly the kind of thing a good therapist can help you work through to understand why you were concerned and whether that concern was reasonable.",r/humantrafficking,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYeUZCc2NOb2lUNkpuRVZRY3BTOTNRWjVnWEFJcGQwQjhhYklSM0d6NDlLVWpWTE1zM3dPal9YU2JLc0pPLWhZQkRHVHQxZFM1enZUbVhxc3FFemFGdFE9PQ==
