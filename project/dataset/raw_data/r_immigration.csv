"Visa: the stamp affixed to your passport 

Status: the immigration category under which you are in the United States. 

When you arrive at the immigration check point you apply to enter into the US. The visa is the pre qualification. The CBP officer will admit you under a category (which 99.9999% of the time is what is in your visa stamp). The officer will stamp your passport with a little ink stamp and will hand-write your status and when your status expires. He will also issue an i-94 card with the same info (they used to give you a physical card, now it is electronic)

Once you are in the US your visa stamp means nothing. It can expire, get destroyed.... Whatever. Your status is in that i-94 card. 

When you entered with an F visa you were probably given F status and the officer wrote ""D/S"" for the expiration. This means that you are on F status for as long as you comply with the program. In other words, you are legally present with an F status while you maintain valid student status and have a current i-20 form.

H4 is a derivative status. You don't apply for it directly. An H1b principal (spouse or parent) includes you in his/her application. Once the H1b is approved, you gain the qualifications to be in that status. Note that this approval doesn't change your status. It does not give you a visa. 

If you are in the US under whatever status (including F) you can apply to change status. This is done through form I-539. When you get approved you will get in the mail an updated i-94 card (they still send a physical card) with your new status.  Once this is done you lose your F status and are effectively a H4 dependent. You no longer need to keep your university enrollment, attend class, etc. Your new H4 status lasts until whatever date is on the card (usually the date when the H1b status ends for the principal). You can stay in the US with no problem until that date (+30 days). The visa stamp in your passport remains irrelevant.

Now, whenever you leave the US your status stops existing (exceptions: brief travel to Canada, Mexico). When you come back, the CBP officer will want to see a visa stamp in your passport. This is when you need to have an H4 visa. Your F visa stamp cannot be used to grant you an H4 admission. So, before you come back to the US you need to go to a US Consulate and get a H4 visa stamp...",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNzdNOXlhN1BKcFBwSUxpRVIzSm9UdEtTMHFfYW42Q29jQmpEN1NxUk9VOFhEbDBwVzd2VVNHWl8tdUtDdDFaMUFhZWFkdXoyYW0zd3pVbW9CWVJ6cHB1RTRVZmxTYTVLa3VWX3dHU0x2ZTA9

You entered the United States with a tourist visa but you were not a credible tourist.  That certainly isn't a point in your favor.  Being a minor will mitigate, whether you were 13 or 19 will depend to what extent. 

You also didn't leave the United States at a designated port of entry.  That's not good, and the burden of proof is on you to prove that you left the United States.  

> You are now a Canadian.

A new nationality in and of itself does not cure immigration sins.

"""I'd rather"" - of course you would and I can't imagine being in your situation. You are a child and haven't done anything wrong. In the eyes of many citizens, you will never have made a morally wrong decision to stay in the place you've been in since Kindergarten. In the eyes of the US Government, once you turn 18 and have been here for 6 months, you will have started doing something illegal that they could use against you. Right now, you have not. If after that point, you stay illegally, there's always a chance you could be deported. You could draw it out for a while, but eventually, you couldn't avoid it. In that case, what would you be doing? I encourage you to think ahead. Post-secondary school in Canada is a one option that doesn't have anything to do with marriage. It's a relatively straight path to citizenship if you play your cards right. Canadian citizens with a NEXUS card in their wallet drive over the border on a whim in Niagara, for instance, for grocery shopping, etc. Most people don't get married until 30 these days so understand that commenters are asking a 15-year-old to literally wait a lifetime to not be exposed to the possibility of deportation.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZWmVZQWc4NVZ1aGtFZmZHNXJxdkNpVFNEMV9NT3JYdzFvVVo1cTZzMVVZV1BueVRDSWZ0ZEU2QUZJS2d4RXpMNGc4T0xsSWlOSVBWSnY3ek93WU1udzdHVzhGWkM2dmR1dUl6MTlpUFZVaVE9

"There is probably a record of the asylm request declaration. I believe the procedure on entry to Canada via irregular means is to present yourself at the local police station and request asylum. That gets the ball rolling. There should be documentation of this event. As long as OP is able to show that the crossing date was within the validity of the US tourism date, that should help.

OP, I recommend trying the crossing on a day trip with a close friend and not colleagues, gather the following in case it's needed:

1. asylum filing form that shows the date the initial request was made on entry into Canada

2. Canadian passport

3. Canadian naturalization documents

4. copies of lease or mortgage papers and your work contract

On a Canadian passport you should be able to cross without issue, but showing deep ties in CAnada and an intention to return, should aid in that.

"We applied last the first week of April 2023 and it took 11 months. The initial form (I-129f) is processing in 4-6 months now. Ours was 9 months; visa was in hand by March 5th 2024. 
The London embassy moves quickly. It was 60 days from the I-129f being accepted to having the interview. 
Currently, when people are able to book their interview in London, interviews are around 1 calendar month later (someone booked a couple of days ago and the first available date was August 22nd). 

During the processing time, your fiancée can continue to visit for short trips on the ESTA. We had 3 trips during the processing.

Once you have the visa, you have 6 months (from the date of the medical) to enter the US. The date of arrival starts the 90 day clock, and you need to get married within those 90 days. 

You then need to apply for the adjustment of status. That is taking a variable about of time; from 9 months to 24+. During that time your partner cannot work or leave the US, although they can apply for a work and travel permit for extra cost. The permit still takes 6-9 months to be granted before they can work or travel. 

They can, however, get an SSN, bank account, driving license, etc., prior to doing the AoS.

"USCIS is not saying they aren’t going to accept your CRBA. An RFE isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s exactly what it says: a request for additional evidence. 


You even admit to the discrepancies regarding your status. The onus of updating USCIS of your USC status fell on your parents when you were a minor and now on you as an adult. 


If no one ever sent documents to update USCIS, it’s not unreasonable for them to request additional evidence to clarify.



It’d be worth your while to get a consult with an immigration lawyer, but additional evidence would likely be:


Your dad’s birth certificate,


Your dad’s list of addresses prior to your entry to the US, 


The DNA test, 


The CRBA approval notice or docs re the application,


Your SSN card,


Etc.



They’re not trying to trick you, but if you don’t provide them info and documentation pertaining to your status, they won’t have it. They’re just trying to clarify and correct your record.

This lady had agents search for at her bf house a week after she had overstayed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/s/gidMZFUExx

Here is my story.

I came here via a tourist visa, at the time to visit my then bf now husband. I was given about 6 months before i had over stayed. We had decided we want to get married and start my greencard process.

We consulted to an immigration attorney cos my 6 months was about to be up. He said all was fine and since we were now married, starting the process would be sufficient enough and what not.

1 week after my stay period ended i had homeland security at our door. To deport me. They havent even gotten papers stating we were married and started status adjustment. Luckily they were understanding and made appointments and stuff but i was put on deportation process which took us 3 years and a deportation attorney as well as over 10k $ to fix and finally get my greencard.

So, dont take things for granted and if anything, seek legal help asap.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZbDNMWTljVHl6YXJSbzV6SjE0amFJSGhSd2l3V3V3SlhwVklLUXI4blNabGdpNVNrdlFBRTFqWDJ4MEN0OUpVSmhQVDZfek10dVphY1dmSWdqQWpQNnc9PQ==
"Go to the nearest Civil Registry office of wherever you are and ask how to register your birth abroad so you can get your Mexican birth certificate.

After you have your birth certificate get a Mexican passport.

"It would be really difficult to get asylum based on gender alone in the US. Most asylum claims from women escaping gang violence in Latin America make some sort of gender claim, but that by itself is usually not enough. 

Unfortunately, violence against women is too broad and not considered persecution for purposes of asylum. It has to be more narrow. For the Middle East/North Africa, there are specific cultural practices that target women - like honor killings, female genital mutilation, and specific laws targeting women. Some women have been successful in getting asylum because they were fleeing these specific gender-based practices.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZcHp2d2JqckFkTTJvYUlSOU1Za2xnUW9WdXBpTGRDNUVmTXNQM3VheS1BZGZ4RjFBNnVNRjdRWUlsQkxSY3JhQUpHcFRUWkZfbjQ4U1JjS0toTmtyMmc9PQ==

"It depends on what the felony is. If it's an aggravated felony or a ""particularly serious crime"", then the person is not eligible for asylum. But that doesn't mean they'll be sent back. There are two other forms of relief, Withholding of Removal (WOR) and Protection Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Whereas asylees are eligible for a green card and later citizenship, WOR and CAT do not lead to a green card (but eligible for a work permit). With WOR, a person is basically ordered deported but is not deported in actuality.

"That's not at all true, my old man switched political parties here in Pennsylvania back In 2012/2013 to run as the head of economic development for a Republican county head.... I was privileged enough to attend many dinners and social events meeting most of the top Republicans in the state and their leading donors. Here's what I learned, country folk, inner city minorites, and immigrants are their top tier undesirable and the exact wording they used when discussing my area and revitalization was ""to bring a better class of people to the valley, one who is college educated, who makes $70,000 or more, has disposable income, and holds strong moral fibers."" Immigrants don't meet those requirements, and often times would throw around ""American Family's First"" in other words get rid of diversity hiring, don't hire immigrants, American born get special considerations and even if your qualified or more qualified the American will get the job. I laugh every single day, even as a citizen I don't vote because I also know it's all a sham, a fraud, a fake system propped up so heavily on funding campaigns that the politics don't actually matter. State elections for the local government races cost 5million+ and goes up if you make a senate or house run or a congressional run is very pricy. So the only people who have a say are the ones who are giving large large sums of money to campaigns and making it so their war chests are full. They than give tax breaks to those same people who already used their campaign contribution as a tax Wright off. Than you have Trump who openly admitted to swindling and avoiding taxes during his Hillary debate and the people ate that shit up like he could do no wrong.

"I guess he can not mention the whole becoming a father part unless they specifically ask him if he is? 

But technically everyone can be denied access for all sorts of reasons. There is no guaranteed acces unless you have citizenship.

I was always told to never surrender more info than what is asked of me at the border. I personally never had any issues either way despite saying I'm visiting my boyfriend/later husband and was never asked for proof of employment. At two points I also was unemployed / in between jobs when entering the US, however I wasn't asked about my job so I just didn't mention it. I always keep my answers as short as possible and don't give any details aside from the exact answer to what I was asked, and so far border control was always friendly and quick to wave me through.

You mentioned that he cares for a family member in the UK, he could bring proof of that, rental contracts or anything else that shows he has reasons to return. In Germany where I am from you can get registered on paper as someones care taker, so maybe check if he can do that for his family member in the UK. I feel like that should be of help. If it's been a while since his last visit I think that should also look good for him.

"Your mother is lying, of course. USCIS and immigration law has no rules regarding sexual intercourse. 

Generally speaking, as a green card holder, you cannot be deported from the US unless you are convicted of a crime of moral turpitude (a serious felony of some sort), or if you obtained the green card through some sort of fraud.

Not only can green card holders have sex with American citizens, but people that received green cards through marrying American citizens do that quite regularly.

I'm not saying that you should have sex with this person, of course. There's health risks, pregnancy risks, and they could just be a bad choice (I have no idea).

"Doesn't work like this at all. You can't just move to the US and you are not getting a Greencard like that.

Most immigrants come through family sponsorship, that means they are married to an American or got immediate family. This is the most common way to acquire a Greencard, every other option involves investing a lot of money or being extraordinarily talented in one's field. Getting permanent residency in the US is impossible for most people without direct family.

For the standard H1B work visa you need at least a BA that's equal to a US one and some work experience plus a sponsoring company. The company then enters the applicant into a lottery pool, the chances of actually getting an H1B are 25-30% as it's extremely oversubscribed.  
A company won't even go through the trouble unless they really want you and can't find anyone in the US to do the same job.

The ""easiest"" option is working for an international company with offices in the US and then get a transfer via an L1 visa. The most difficult part is probably convincing your employer to actually go through with such a move, again if it's not necessary, they might not want to do it.

That's your options.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNi1fZENSQXN3bXAweXZ0RVNJVGxpa0gzUDdJQkJVaWdnZmJlZjdBdlBJRXV3TTFvZmZjdUtPMW54TGVmekNVb1BlaXpxajQtSGl0azR1MTZLaGVBRnc9PQ==

"Since your BA is not related to your field of employment, the H category is not really an option, and those roles are not really “specialty” occupations either.

Another route you could consider is completing a Masters in the US. That would have you here as an F1 student, which then gives you a year of employment once completed and then another two years (if it is a STEM field). After that, H1B is more viable.

"This is less of an immigration question and more of a car sales /personal finance question.   
A lot of people have been in a similar situation: they owe more in a car than the car is worth, and need to get rid of it. 

First off, the car in theory is owned by the bank, not by you. If you sell it to carmax, they will check the equity, and will make you pat them the payoff difference on the spot. Essentially, they will take the car + 4k and that's it. 

If you sell it privately, what makes the most sense (for the buyer) is to meet at the bank, they hand you the money, and then you use that money to pay off the loan, and have the title transferred to the buyer. This is more complicated. And a lot of buyers won't love the idea (or might not have the cash). If you only have 1 month, this might be hard. 

If you have the money, you can pay it off, and then sell it.

When your PD becomes current, you have a year to either apply for your visa or to notify NVC that you still want the visa but not now. If you do the latter, then before the year is up, you must notify NVC again. And thus you can delay your visa indefinitely.

However, eventually if you keep doing this, your 11 year old will age out. Assuming your 11 year old’s cspa age is actually 11 (which is unlikely; younger than 11 is the norm), then when your PD becomes current, your children must have “sought to acquire” a visa within a year in order to lock in their cspa ages at under age 21.

"90 days seems an absurd amount of time for a job interview, so you risk the officer suspecting that you are lying. In truth, you typically want to book a stay for less than 90 days anyway because you don't want anything to happen that delays your departure and leaves you in the US longer than your limit.

You should be truthful and be able to provide supporting information (itineraries, where you'll stay, etc.) to answer any questions. If you plan to use a portion of that time to visit friends and sight see, then you also inform them of that.

What's acceptable is ultimately up to the CBP officer that processes you when you come to the USA. Certain activities are obviously prohibited by the nature of the terms of your admission, but visiting, sight seeing, and job interviewing are all permitted activities and as long as you do them in less than 90 days, you can do them in whatever combination you choose. Their concern will be whether or not you: a) are entering legally, and b) are an overstay risk. If you have an ESTA and a passport, you've pretty much answered ""a"".

"This is a destination wedding, and a B visa is appropriate, per [9 FAM 402.2-4(B)(1)](https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040202.html#M402_2_4_B_1):

> (U) An applicant proceeding to the United States to marry a U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days of admission is classifiable as a K-1 nonimmigrant under INA 101(a)(15)(K).  See 22 CFR 41.81.  The fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen or LPR may, however, be classified as **a B-2 visitor if you are satisfied that the fiancé(e) intends to return to a residence abroad soon after the marriage.**  

As the other commentators have said, you do have the challenge of showing that you'll intend to return back to Hong Kong after the marriage, and you don't want to misrepresent the purpose of your visit, as that will cause bigger problems. 

The K-1 process is much longer, as it's processed like an immigrant visa (you file a petition with USCIS, establishing the relationship; when it's approved, it's sent to the NVC which collects civil documents from you; and then finally the whole file is sent to the immigrant visa unit at a US consulate/embassy where you need to interview). It's also significantly more expensive. 

After you arrive in the K-1, you're meant to file for adjustment of status, which is the process of applying for the conditional residency you mention. You can just skip this step and leave the US again, but you won't be able to re-enter without a different visa. 

It looks like the [wait times](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/global-visa-wait-times.html) for B interviews in Hong Kong aren't too ridiculous, so they could apply for the B, fully disclosing their plans to get married and return, and if turned down then either you can start the K process or choose a different country for your wedding.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhZFpvT3dPSVUyVXozb21CRktYUkRJeTRmaEdoeDZIS0JWQndRQWNmdm9fczJOVUxOSE1SQUk0TTNrdzBmQ1FPUWd1NjRoRlB1MXIwTWZWbGYzLTNUY0E9PQ==

What has she done anything outside of just posting articles? 

- Been invited to speak at conferences or events? Has events lined up in the future? How was/is her role lead or staring? 
- Does she run a gym/business or some other “production” that is directly related to the blog? What will she do in the U.S.? How was/is her role lead or staring?
- Have articles been written about her and her work? Has she received international and national recognition from acclaimed sources?
- Having a large following/subscribers by itself (at the minimum in the thousands, ideally well well above that) won’t convince USCIS. They so far are skeptical that follower count indicates extraordinary ability. 
- If the blog isn’t monetized yet she won’t satisfy the remuneration criterion.

- Also, how would she be continuing her work in the U.S.? Does she have an employer or agent that would sponsor her?

"The only way to get the O-1B is by 1) receiving or being nominated for a significant national/international award or prize in a particular field (e.g. Academy Award, Grammy, Emmy) *or* 2) satisfying at least 3 of the 6 listed criteria for whatever artistic pursuit. 

So her being an extra would not materially help an O-1B for a blogger. Plus motion picture/TV is a distinct sub-category of O-1B [the O-1B (MPTV)].

If she reads the Policy Manual (it is fairly plain language) to get an idea of what evidence USCIS wants, she can work on strengthening her profile over the next few months to years. A second hurdle is: she needs to be coming to the U.S. to work in the area of her extraordinary ability (blogging), so she needs to find a sponsor whether that be an agent or U.S. employer. 

I also will say that the government filing fees alone for an O-1 (Form I-129) are pricey and if she retains an attorney (and many do for O-1s because they are complex) the cost of the visa is going to end up being several thousand U.S. dollars

"The basic requirements for moral or religious convictions are that they object to all vaccines of any form and that the conviction is sincere. For the latter point, the burden is entirely on the applicant to demonstrate that it's not just a preference for the purposes of getting the waiver. Depending on their medical history it may be difficult to demonstrate that the conviction is sincere (e.g. if their objection is limited in scope to just vaccines, there won't be other examples they can draw on of going against their own self-interest), and that's not the US government's problem. They should be prepared to account for any vaccines that they have previously received (e.g. they were a child at the time, under the authority of a parent) in order to show that they aren't objecting to just one vaccine.

Do you just want to get married, or do you specifically want to get married in the US? Is there any reason you can't get married in Hong Kong? (Or any other country). If your fiance just wants to visit the US, you want to get married here (maybe because your family is here or something) then they can enter on a visitor visa, get married and then return home. The burden of proof that they will NOT stay in the US and just adjust status may be higher - if you are not living in the US, or you can prove that after your marriage you will be leaving the US to live with your spouse, it's fairly straight forward. It's perfectly legal to get married on a tourist visa in the US, you just can't come here on a tourist visa with the plan to get married and adjust status. The K1 takes at least a year, is significantly more expensive, and has a lot of scrutiny - I'm not sure why that would be the preferred visa for this.",r/immigration,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNhVDE3WjVoVzVjSmRXTnBGYkNTcUhQMjdJQXc2Y0F0Yy0xM3R4UkZkV1N2blM5OUVPcjFIZUtKOTlwQ0JkNktiOVFKeHViOVJNeWtMVXJWX0xJMlExZGc9PQ==

"If you haven't filed yet, I would just get married and do the spouse visa. It allows for the 601 waiver if needed, it has an appeals process if it is denied because of this, and it's significantly more affordable than the K1 with many benefits.

"US immigration doesn't really differentiate between arranged marriages and marriages that are not arranged.

If you plan to marry outside the USA, then your fiancé will need to file a form I-130 to petition for your admission to the USA. If you are legally in the USA at the time, your fiancé will also file a form I-485 at the same time. Otherwise, you may apply for a K-3 visa to enter the USA while the form I-130 is being processed. If you do that, your fiancé can also file a form I-129 so that you can enter the US while the K-3 visa is being processed.

You should not enter as a tourist because you have the intention of immigration.

You should accept that if you want to legally join your spouse in the US, you may well need to wait for some time. Your spouse should engage the services of an immigration lawyer (in the USA) that can help with the process.

You do NOT want to ""get married online"" as that will not be considered legitimate and will alarm US immigration, suggesting to them immigration / marriage fraud.

"Like I mentioned, it is legal to get married on a B1/B2, but actually getting approved for a B1/B2 with the specific intention of getting married in the US is a different conversation.
 
As I would never recommend lying to the visa officer during an interview, obtaining a B1/B2 for the purpose of getting married in the US will be nearly impossible… especially in a country like China where many have a good reason to try to leave any way they can. I just have a difficult time seeing any visa officer approve that visa.

Remember the tourist visa interview starts from the presumption of intending immigrant and it is the job of the applicant to convince the visa officer in 2 minutes or less they don’t intend to use the tourist visa as a means to bypass US immigration laws.

The K1 is a longer process, more complex, and most people do it with the intent of immigration… but there should be no hiccups and the visa officer, at the time of interview, really wont care what the plans are after the wedding. They are looking to see if it is a sham marriage and thats it.

Personally, I would recommend getting married in a third country, then get her a tourist visa, and having a second ceremonial marriage in the US (and getting the marriage registered in the US maybe), but the OP said she wants to get married in the US.

"First, congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!  Second, as my grandfather would say ""whoa, horsey!""  Nothing, and I meant nothing to do with immigration is going to be fast, and rarely easily.   Please don't get you hopes up for getting married and coming her right away and settling down.  I'm not trying to be rude, just trying to keep you grounded.

If it's any consolation, the time frames will have nothing to do with it being an arranged marriage.  It's just the way the law works.  You can't get a fiance vise because you don't have a per-existing relationship.  But that would apply to anyone that had had a purely online relationship as well.  Also, make sure you do this the right way.  I'd strongly suggest a lawyer.  It's illegal to enter on a visitor visa with the intent to immigrate.   That could get you barred from the US for a long time.  Remember, just because you marry a US citizen does not mean you have to be given a green card.  They can refuse it.  Without a prior relationship, and having lied about your reason for entering the US (using a visitor visa to immigrate) would put you in a tough stop.  So, please don't think about trying that.  

Also, marrying online without having met before and after won't help you.  You won't be considered married until you have met after you married online.  Trying that would likely just cause more problems.

Your fiance needs to contact a US based immigration lawyer to help you through this. It will cost more, but if you screw it up accidentally, it will take a lawyer and lots more money and time to fix it.  Do it right the first time.

"Once your son's I-485 is filed, he can continue to stay. He won't age out. Furthermore, one remains a permanent resident while the removal of conditions is in progress.

If you can get an EB1A approval, it is obviously preferred as you are not risking $800,000. However, EB1A is very hard to get approved for. If you have the money and would not mind never seeing the 800k back, you can try EB5. There are some variables beyond your control - the job creation aspect. Even if your I-526 gets approved and you get conditional residence, things may go tits up by the time you have to file removal of conditions.. It is not as straightforward as pay us 800k and we give you a green card and then remove conditions.. 

You should speak with a proper lawyer.

Name change is more of a /r/legaladvice thing, and the specifics will depend on the state.

You also likely don't _need_ to change your birth certificate, if it's burdensome. 

As for the passport, you don't mention your country of citizenship. For the US, if you have one that's currently valid or recently expired you can renew it by mail with evidence of the name change. You can also self-select your gender marker when renewing.

"ChatGPT can be helpful when used well. Comparing the above to Project 2025 it wasn't far off. This below I pulled directly from project 2025. It does look like just a massive overhaul  


>Evaluation of national security–vulnerable visa programs. To protect the American people, the State Department, in coordination with the White House and other security-focused agencies, should evaluate several key security-sensitive visa programs that it manages. Key programs include, but should not be limited to, the Diversity Visa program, the F (student) visa program, and J (exchange visitor) visa program. The State Department’s evaluation must ensure that these programs are not only consistent with White House immigration policy, but also align with its national security obligations and resource limitations.



>*The incoming Administration should spearhead an immigration legislative agenda focused on creating a merit-based immigration system that rewards high skilled aliens instead of the current system that favors extended family–based and luck-of-the-draw immigration. To that end, the diversity visa lottery should be repealed, chain migration should be ended while focusing on the nuclear family, and the existing employment visa program should be replaced with a system to award visas only to the “best and brightest.”*

"If you read the Project 2025 rundowns they give what is probably our best guess at this point for what things will look like and they are mostly focused on clamp downs on illegals, and gumming up the works by a lot of nitty rules like requiring security clearance for immigration officers, or requiring backlogs be cleared before even considering more visas. Less so slashing whole classes of visas or paths to GC just making them suck a lot more.
