"About Karnataka State Board Of Auqaf

The Karnataka State Board of Waqfs is a statutory body constituted under the Waqf Act 1995 which is a Central Act. About 45,468 Waqfs are registered with the Board. These include Masjid, Dargahs, Idgahs, Khabrastans (burial grounds), Ashoorkhanas, Orphanages, Makans, etc., The Board is made up of nominated and elected members from various categories and the Chairman is elected by the members. The staff of the Board is headed by the Chief Executive Officer who is a KAS Officer in the Senior scale. There are District Waqf Advisory Committee Offices in all the 30 districts of the State. The Board exercises powers of superintendence and control over all the waqf institutions. The Board appoints Muthawallies and managing committees to the Waqf institutions from time to time after election or nomination by Jamaath as per their Scheme of Management. All the Waqf institutions are required to submit their Budget Estimate and financial accounts to the Board and the Board undertakes audit of the major institutions. The financial transaction of the Board itself is audited by the Government (State Accounts Dept.) and the Accountant General. The Board takes various steps to protect Waqf properties from encroachment and unauthorized occupation. The Board gives the administrative and legal support to the Waqf institutions who carry out their developmental and socio welfare activities.

How the Board helps the Wakf institutions? The Government of Karnataka releases Grant-in-Aid to take up repairs, renovations and constructions. So many Waqf institutions benefit from this every year. Small waqf institutions in remote villages having no sources of income benefit the most from this Scheme. The Board also engages Advocates to help the waqf institutions in protecting and safeguarding their properties. The Board is a party in cases before the Waqf Tribunal, Civil Courts & High Court and thus defends the interest of the Auqaf.

Prevention of encroachment of Wakf properties: Valuable Wakf properties go into the hands of unscrupulous land grabbers and the Board takes action to remove such encroachments by exercising powers undr Section 54 of the Wakf Act. Recoveries of rents by Wakf institutions and eviction of unauthorized occupants: Karnataka and Rajasthan are the only two States in the country who have adopted the Public Premises Act for the Wakf properties. The Chief Executive Officer of the Board is the Competent Authority under the Karnataka Public Premises Act and he receives complaints from Wakf institutions whose tenants have become defaulters in the payment of rents or have over stayed the lease period. More and more Wakf institutions are utilizing this facility to find redress from the chronic problem of defaulting tenants who have occupied properties of the Mosques and are paying rents at a pittance. Finances of the Board: The Board gets 7% wakf contribution from out of the income derived by the Wakf institutions after meeting their expenses, of which 1% is sent by the Board to the Central Wakf Council, New Delhi.",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTMGxBLW5FbThDSURBMnl0OXJ1LVNLZEtCYWs5dmNkV2VKaGVtV2Zvb3RaUk1vekJqN0J5cHo2aERzX0ZrMjIwRmNNNnZfMDNOaEo2TUs2T0Qxa0k0Mmc9PQ==

"**Full Text of the Post - For Archiving Purposes**

Hello! posting on an alt account for privacy reasons but I am an Chinese American college student majoring in international studies at JHU SAIS. I have translated and summarized one of the most popular posts on Zhihu (China's Quora) about Chinese- Indian relations. I feel this is useful information to share as it summarizes and explains the CCP's current view of India (accurate based on my personal links to CCP) and explains why China behaves so antagonistically. This post is **LONG** but is still much shorter than the original. The original has 9 chapters, chapters 5 - 9 focusing on Chinese military strategy in a Sino- Indian war. In the r/india post I have focused on the politics and reasons for conflict described in chapters 1-4. **For** r/geopolitics **I have added a shortened version of chapter 5 describing the importance of Taiwan in Chinese grand strategy.**  I have left out most of the historical background, Chinese idioms and cultural aspects in an effort to shorten the post. **The most important parts are in bold and italicized, I would highly recommend reading those**. Feel free to pm with any questions, Ill try to answer some in the comments. Apologies in advance for mistranslations and/or incorrect information.

If this post gets enough attention, I will post all the chapters and maybe even the full translation. if you want to read the full post I have attached the link. Google translate is 70% accurate and there are a few very important errors.

**Link to post:** [**https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401**](https://www.zhihu.com/question/421319290/answer/1812313401)

**Chapter One, India is big trouble for China in the future**

Today, China faces significant problems on its borders, totally surrounded by strong neighbors. The United States has unprecedented strength and continues to threaten national security. Russia. although it has a small population, has a large geographical advantage . Although Sino-Russian relations are good in the short term, it could be a big variable in the long run. However, an opponent with a great potential threat but easily underestimated is India. India is very weak on the surface, but has a greater potential for development. If you take the long-term view, India is likely to be a significant power in the future.

One reason many people like to laugh at India is that in the 1980s, the economic strength of China and India was evenly matched, but after China’s reform and opening up, China’s economy grew rapidly, and China’s GDP is now five times that of India. This shows how slow India’s economic growth is. However, if you compare it on a global scale, you can actually find that India’s economic growth is not slow. Since 1980, India’s GDP has increased 30 fold. In contrast, the GDP of other developing countries except China and India has only increased 10 fold, and the GDP of developed countries has even increased 8 fold. To a certain extent, it is not that India’s economic development is slow, but that China’s economic growth is too fast. ***China’s economic achievements conceal India’s economic miracle. If there is no comparison with China, then India’s economic growth can be considered a global miracle.***

On the other hand, China’s rapid economic growth has not come without a price. Due to strict family planning rules, China today faces the problem of aging and declining birthrate at the same time. India has not implemented such a strict family planning policy, and the proportion of young people is very high. Although this has dragged down economic growth, India’s demographic dividend advantage has become increasingly prominent in the past ten years. We know that young people are the main creators of social wealth, and the number of young people has a great influence on the economic strength of China. To some extent, if the number of young people in India is twice that of China in 2050, even if India’s per capita output is only half of China by then, India’s GDP will be on par with China and become the world’s top three economies.

A power of more than one billion people can never be underestimated, although India is a very weak country at the moment, and the lower limit is low; but the future development potential is very large, the upper limit is very high. Although China is now flourishing, if one day the country is facing an aging crisis, on one hand, fewer young people lead to a decline in the number of soldiers, on the other hand, the country has been undergoing such a crises a long period of time, the national willingness to fight is reduced. At that time, it will be much more difficult to deal with a potentially rising India than it is now.

**Chapter Two, the conflicts between China and India can hardly be reconciled**

It is difficult to reconcile the China-India conflict, just as it was difficult to reconcile the China-Soviet conflict before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The underlying reasons are not explained by ideology, territorial disputes, cultural differences, or foreign policy.

In the 1960s and 1980s, China’s greatest threat was from none other than the Soviet Union. If a torrent of Soviet tanks goes south from Mongolia, it will hit Beijing within a week. Since ancient times, the greatest external threat to China has been from the North. And in modern times, Soviet Russia has assumed this role. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was unprecedentedly powerful and had nothing better than a torrent of armored tanks. This was similar to ancient cavalry, fast and ruthless, able to tear a hole in the opponent's defenses in a very short time

The key issue is that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union maintained absolute geographic superiority . The Soviet Union not only controlled the outer northeast, but also Mongolia. When the Soviet Union did not control Mongolia, if the Soviet Union wanted to attack China, it still had to go south from the Northeast Plain and enter North China after conquering the Shanhai pass. But with control of the Mongolian Plateau, the Soviet Union faced much fewer obstacles when attacking China. Soviet tanks only had to cross the Yinshan Mountains to enter Hebei. After that, Beijing would be basically insecure to defend. In this case, China may only have to move south like the Central Plains dynasties in the past, and use the southern rivers as a line to fight against the Soviet army.

This is the fundamental reason why China would fight with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and cooperate with the West without hesitation. As long as Mongolia is controlled by the Soviet Union, China’s national defense cannot be assured. Thanks to an independent mongolia, China and Russia are moving towards reconciliation, in the long run, due to Russia's natural geopolitical suppression, it is still a potential threat, and China and Russia still guard against each other.

Taking the example of the Soviet Union, we can understand why Sino-Indian relations are difficult to reconcile. ***The geography of India is very similar to China The main population centers of China are on the North China Plain, and Beijing is the throat into the North China Plain. The population centers of India are on the Ganges Plain, and New Delhi is the throat to enter the Ganges Plain. The south has similar broken terrain and a long coastline, and the southeast has a large island like Sri Lanka.***

But compared to China, India's geography is extremely bad. All of the core areas of India are in the hands of other countries (Indus river, Lower Ganges, Siri Lanka). India does not have many natural barriers. The coastline is too long and it is easy to be attacked by east and west, while China only needs to defend the east. This makes India very easy to invade as seen in history. ***This is the reason why India invaded Tibet in the 1960s and maintained a relatively high military expenditure for a long time. It cannot be said that India is a militaristic state, but because in the context of geographical disadvantages, it can only maintain military balance by spending more than its opponents.***  
For India, China is the biggest geo-threat. This is because China not only controls the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but also is an ally with Pakistan. Once China and India go to war, India will almost certainly lose without external intervention. India’s Ganges plain is in danger and is at a great disadvantage. The geographical disadvantages of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the alliance between China and Pakistan are part of the reasons why China-India relations cannot be reconciled. ***But in the long run, even if China and India can complete the territorial conflicts and China and Pakistan no longer are allies, it will be difficult for China and India to reconcile completely. The reason is that both China and India want to become superpowers and leaders in Asia, inevitably leading to strategic collisions.***  
In the future, if both China and India want to rise up and become leaders in Asia, conflicts of interest will inevitably arise. The key point of the conflict is Southeast Asia, the backyard of both counties. Southeast Asia is extremely rich in resources and possesses the oil and rubber needed for war. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is characterized by scattered power and small countries. Forming battlegrounds for any major countries. China and India both have significant cultural and historical ties with the region. Southeast Asia has many Chinese and Indians. To a certain extent, Southeast Asia is to China and India what Latin America is to the United States, Eastern Europe is to Germany and Russia, and North Korea is to China and Japan. They belong to the range of interests that must be contested.

Therefore, if both China and India become stronger in the future, they are likely to fiercely compete for dominance in Southeast Asia. On land, India can rely on the northeast states to infiltra",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTeUJvSk1YTUwwNC1sSHdTZ0J3dVJtbzBIcjRhaUJSUmFTUXZtYWpGU0NZMnVXOFJtaFRTREFkNmEtck9IdTczXzhZbndVLXNuSWxnbFBmd2lRUWpwS2c9PQ==

Hi, I liked the discussion on this sub I read in past 5 days, so I really wanted to dig deep into this topic, and I did some research today about leadership of India, not the usual Modi, Manmohan, Bajpeyi and Dr. Kalam, but about their other leaders like in state or district or just random political leaders with power and popularity. 

What was shocking to me was many of them were radical hindutva bigots, some communists and corrupt leaders too. Very similar to us where we have radical islamist, left ones and corrupt, but what was the shocking part was that most of the state leader I searched (chief minister) were mostly non corrupt and very less radical or atleast not giving radical speeches except few like Yogi in UP. 

Their state leaders are mostly inclined to their state identity and its progress and selected by people directly. 

So examples I looked into are CM and HM of Gujarat, the state of modi are not corrupt, the HM lives in a normal appartment building like I see in Lahore and sounds very smart as I couldn't understand half his words, similar was the CM of Kerala of the communist party. The finance minister of a state called Telangana from south was talking about promoting Blockchain Technology which Waqar Zaka keeps talking about that our government doesn't listen to him, the bjp hindutva mp from banglore speaks a lot of facist things but he is also promoting Bangalore as IT hub and talking about creating R&D hub of asia there and what progress they made. 

I read about almost all their Chief Ministers and except Yogi, CM of Assam, Maharashtra Shiv Sena CM most other 25 CM were not that vocal facists and most including Yogi guy are not very corrupt, only corrupt politicians I found with very high level of corruption like we have here in Zardari, Sharif were politicians from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Bihar which to be honest is very shocking and made me think about this question, that what is difference here as we have same people, they too have radical religious extremists, their media feels more state funded and propoganda machine than ours, people I have seen online or interacted sounds similar so what really is the difference I am unable to point out really. How they are having so many good leaders at state level and even their worst leaders are radicals but not corrupt, and even leaders like Arvind Kejriwal of AAP party in Delhi non radical and non corrupt someone similar to IK. 

So my question is what you guys think, were we go wrong or we went wrong? Is it that our civil societies were unable to spread awareness or education or something else?

"Built on a cliff between Manjhi and Banganga rivers, the Kangra Fort holds a strong legacy of its own as the largest and the oldest one in the Himalayas.

Spread across more than 463 acred, the fort stands tall as the eighth largest fort in India.

Presently, it is under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which restored it from the colossal damage it incurred in the 1905 earthquake.

ASI conservation assistant Prashant Dogra said, “The monument has now become a much sought after destination, especially among tourists.”

The fort stands as a testament to the region’s rich cultural heritage and architectural grandeur.

Spanning over 4,000 years of history, the formidable fortress has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, endured sieges and conquests, and remained a symbol of resilience and strength through the ages.

From its towering walls to intricately carved Jain and Ambika Devi temples, every aspect of the fort reflects the rich tapestry of history and culture that defines the Kangra Valley.

Katoch Dynasty scion Aishwarya Katoch, who was recently crowned at the fort, said, “Kangra Fort has so many unique features. The European Moorish castles, having a typical medieval fortification of square-shaped bastions, have an influence of the Kangra Fort.

The battlements at such heights are wonders of architecture. ‘Andheri Darwaza’ — the last line of defence before entering the palace — is an architectural miracle as its design is such that it allows only three persons to enter at a time, with guards keeping an eye from the top.”

The strategic location of Kangra Fort made it an impregnable bastion for centuries.

The fort’s defensive architecture includes multiple gates, watchtowers, moats and bastions strategically positioned to repel invaders and thwart enemy advances.

Despite facing numerous sieges and attacks over the centuries, Kangra Fort remained unconquered for much of its history, a testament to the ingenuity and foresight of its builders.

As the famous saying about the fort goes: “The one who conquered Kangra, would control the hills.”

History and the lore

It is simply not possible to separate the history of the fort from that of the Katoch Dynasty. As the lore goes, Goddess Ambika fought a demon called Raktbeej. With every drop of the demon’s blood, another came to life. Goddess Ambika wiped her brow and a drop of sweat fell. From the drop, the founder of the Katoch dynasty – Bhumi Chandra — was born. He helped the Goddess defeat the demon and, in return, was blessed with a kingdom called Trigarth — meaning the land between three rivers — Ravi, Beas and Sutlej.

The history of the fort can be traced back to the period of the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Susharma Chandra, the 234th descendent of Bhumi Chand, is said to have fought from the Kauravas side.

King Parmanand Chandra finds a mention in Ptolemy’s text as the famous Porus who fought Alexander the Great.

In 1009 AD, Mahmud Ghazni invaded the fort, looting the treasures hidden in the wells. Mughal Emperor Akbar tried to conquer the fort, but failed. Subsequently, the Mughals held the fort from 1622 to the late 1780s, after which the Sikhs captured it.

In the early nineteenth century, Sansar Chand of Kangra rose to prominence. To this day, he is remembered as a greatest warrior, and a patron of art. The world-renowned miniature paintings of Kangra flourished during his tenure.

Sansar Chand conquered the nearby kingdoms of Chamba, Mandi, Suket and Nahan, turning his attention to Bilaspur soon after. To counter this, in 1805, The Bilaspur raja summoned Gurkhas — who had already acquired Garhwal, Sirmour and other small hill states of Shimla. By 1809, Kangra itself was under a direct threat from the Gurkhas, and Sansar Chand had no choice but to ask Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore for aid.

In return for his help, the Maharaja took possession of the ancient fort. The fort was again with the Katoches. Post the Anglo-Sikh war, the British moved its garrison to occupy Kangra fort. With Ram Singh Pathania of Nurpur, Pramodh Chand rebelled against the British in 1847, declaring their sovereignty.

Maharaja Sansar Chand Museum

An initiative of the present-day Katoch family, the Maharaja Sansar Chand Museum displays the ancestral belongings of the family. It serves as a prime location to have a glimpse of the fort.

The museum is equipped with rare texts, ancient weapons, princely attires, jewellery and even silverware.

Rare miniature masterpieces of Kangra are on display at the museum. Visitors can relish Kangri Dham at the museum. The audio guide narrates details about the museum and the fort.",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTUkNRYXVyNnJzM3c1X0ZPcERBeXJlZE5weTdoWXJYa1dUN04wczc1UzRNS1Z2ZXZZT1Q2cXozbDA4cl9HMmF3SWRGQTNWa3MwOFBsQmh6bEVabnlFR2c9PQ==

White American males are 30% of the population but commit 83% of pedophiIic crime (Source: annual reports from the United States sentencing commission https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Child_Pornography_FY18.pdf)

There are many reports of elite pedophile rings around the world mostly consisting of white men but you don't see them getting stereotyped en masse in the comments whenever that news is reported

There is a hidden epidemic of White men going to Southeast Asia as sex tourists to get with young illegal or barely legal teens. Locals in places like Thailand and the Philippines have been complaining about this for years https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/story?id=2325416&page=1 White male culture has this weird racial superiority fetish thing about East Asian women. It's a big thing on Reddit too and it's disgustingly racist. It's an entire pornography category. Just turn off NSFW filter and search up ""WMAF"" but don't say I didn't warn you it is quite vile, they literally celebrate the genocide of East Asian men while calling them inferior and saying they steal their women

Over the past few decades literally hundreds of thousands and possibly millions of children have been molested by mostly White members of the Catholic Church in Europe https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/world/europe/france-catholic-church-abuse.html

In the UK there was a far right stereotype accusing Pakistani men of running most of the grooming gangs but it turns out that was a lie based on biased police reports they were actually mostly white
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/dec/analysis-new-home-office-report-admits-grooming-gangs-are-not-muslim-problem

All of this yet they don't face stereotypes about this. Why? I think it's because White people control the dominant media worldwide. So White people are perceived as the ""default"" race. And people treat them as individuals, recognizing that a white person's actions shouldn't reflect upon his entire race. The same applies to all races! Yet how many times have you heard a negative generalization about Africa or India as a whole compared to Europe as a whole? Despite the former two being significantly more genetically and culturally diverse than Europe. The world just sees White people as more human.

I’ve come across comparisons of how Soviet, US and Chinese operational and tactical doctrines in this sub that were very well put. That got me thinking of how the Indian military would compare, considering that it’s the world’s 2nd largest in terms of personnel.
Are there any good sources that show any similarities and differences of doctrine when put against the 2 premier militaries of today’s world? Perhaps even a comparison between India and Pakistan would be informative.

"Posting top comment here for archiving purpose:

Both India and Pakistan essentially follow British operational and tactical principles, as well as unit organization. Before and during WW2 there were around 90 King’s Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIOs) who held commands of real significance, and these men took over both the Indian and Pakistani armies after the war. The summary of British operational art in the colonies around WW2 was essentially defense in depth until sufficient concentration could be achieved for a counterattack. Offensives were not to be launched until a mass was built. This was largely because colonial land was considered expendable - the British army certainly would have had a different approach defending Britain itself. Tactically, British SOP revolves around bounding. Whether we are talking about infantry, tanks, artillery, or whatever - any moving element should have a complimentary (and ideally equal) base of fire supporting it.

Unsurprisingly, India won all the wars against Pakistan despite military budget parity between the two until 1971. This is because British (colonial) operational art was entirely unsuited to Pakistan’s situation, and entirely complimentary to India’s. Pakistan had no strategic depth, in the West or the East, so it had to attack. The British army never pulled off a single successful “blitzkrieg” against a peer foe in its history, and even less could be expected of its impoverished foreign colonies. Due both to preference and British command and control (which lacked both the decentralization of German-Japanese command, and the fast staff work of Soviet command), the British way of war did not operate at the speed of some of its peers. Commonwealth senior officers across the empire preferred to probe, maneuver, and test before major actions, and their command and reporting practices developed around that.

Consequently, all the Indo-Pakistani wars followed a familiar pattern: Pakistan launching a clumsy blitzkrieg, poorly imitating the practices of a more offensively capable force like China (1965) or Israel (1971), India effectively bogging it down through defense in depth, and then embarrassing Pakistan with a massive counterattack. This situation was made more inevitable by the fact that both forces were and still are largely infantry based, with less support assets than any other great powers. Such armies naturally fare better on the defensive than the offensive, unless overwhelming mass can be attained. India naturally had the advantage in obtaining this mass as it had “interior lines” until 1971 - East and West Pakistan were between India.

The primary differences between the doctrines of the two rivals were realism/information control and equipment. If you read Indian military journals, they’re a lot like journals in any other great power country. Pakistani journals are… something else. They *never* assess the results of previous actions - any historical anecdote is purely for “story”, along the lines of “I commanded 90 fine men, who fought bravely at Longewala. It was a tough day, and the sun was hot”. This is because the Pakistani army coped with defeat by becoming results-agnostic: they spawned a revisionist historical take where India was *always* a vastly superior foe (both forces were almost equal on paper until 1971) and where all combat with India is a victory, because Pakistan is still around. See Fighting to the End: The Pakistan Army's Way of War for a thorough account of this transformation.

The second difference is in equipment - India has traditionally bought Soviet-Russian equipment and Pakistan Sino-American. This is largely why the Pakistani Air Force, unlike the ground forces, has tended to outperform India’s. This is where doctrinal differences are also the most pronounced. While ground forces can still make do with updated versions of British TTP, aerial doctrine has evolved massively since 1945. India has primarily received Soviet training, and Pakistan American and later Chinese (once the PLAAF’s doctrine became pirated American manuals). PAF places far more emphasis on dogfighting and individual actions while India has stricter ground control and focuses on massed aerial operations. This is not to say PAF’s record is spotless, however - they failed on a number of occasions, most notably their farcical imitation of the Israeli Air Force in Operation Chinghiz Khan. This failure and others were primarily spawned by resource issues - there were simply not enough planes.

On the ground and at sea, however, the technological balance was reversed. Soviet ships and anti-ship missiles made an excellent account of themselves in 1971, as Pakistan’s navy was ravaged and the country was put under blockade. Soviet APCs, which had more widespread amphibious capabilities than their Western counterparts, also enabled a rapid Indian advance through river-dense Bangladesh.

Both forces, especially in recent decades, have tried to create their own equipment. Here the Pakistanis have had more success, again because of discrepancy in allied capabilities. India was highly successful in purchasing Russian ToT after 1991… but the Russian defense industry after 1991 was in an absolutely miserable state. Pakistan, meanwhile, has had the full support and cooperation of China, whose defense industry has followed the complete opposite trajectory.

As far as how Indian doctrine compares to other major powers, it’s overall more flexible, but slower and more “measured” in its operations, than any of them. The U.S., China and Russia have all focused on increasing OPTEMP, through different means and different extents (with Russia being the most obsessive). This has not really been a priority for India. Tactically, Indian doctrine is most like American doctrine… but even here it’s quite distant as it borrows mainly from British principles.",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTdjByTWhTbVJ4Q04zZ19EVFZHQXRYQ3Brc1NEUi1TWXZEMmtFbkdPUUlEZThQQ1N6WU9yblpWWE1KQXoxbDY5TDJiMW9lWEZReGR1VTJUMlk3TjRiYXc9PQ==

Such a war could reduce the average global temperature by up to 6⁰ Celsius for several years, causing worldwide famine, not to mention the nuclear fallout.

"If you look into this research in some detail, the nuclear nature of the weapons is of minimal importance. The effect highlighted here is the result of two main factors:

1) by far the most important effect is the rapid incineration of modern cities containing many plastics. This is what supplies the black carbon (which in these particular conditions leads to cooling). This is analogous to WWII era firebombing in principle, but modern cities are larger and have a different composition. The heat of the thermonuclear explosion is also vastly more efficient at incineration.

2) The initial explosion can punch through the tropopause facilitating transport to the stratosphere, and thereby global dispersal and cooling. In many simulations however, the scale of the fires is often sufficient and the heat they produce enough to transport material to the stratosphere anyway. This is somewhat analogous to recent Australian wildfires.

I don’t think it is emphasized enough that these same effects could be accomplished in large part by other high energy or incendiary means. Governments are not known to possess any other devices of comparable power, but large scale use of conventional ordinance in a total war scenario might result in similar effects. A key source of uncertainty is we do not know what happens when large modern cities become targets for total destruction.",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTaHUySXFYbDA0dW41dERuTTNIOHNja3RxSUkySlBDb0dWdXJoRFpGckNPMzgwbVhmWlpQa0NWek91bVJ1M1JQeWdLdURFUEZlOWZIdGNJSjZfb3ptSUE9PQ==

# MYTH #1 : The British Abolished Slavery in India

1 very specific form of Chattel slavery they claim to abolish, ignoring the fact that they compensated the slave owners, NOT the slaves and sent the “freed” slaves into various other forms of slavery, as I will describe below

**Indian  ”Indenture”**

![img](77x2ujyg87wc1)

Normally, Normally Indentured Servitude isn't normally considered slavery, but Indian Indenture was something else.

Millions of Starving, Impoverished Indians coerced to sign contracts they can’t even read, or simply kidnapped, taken onto ships in horrible conditions to colonies in Africa and the Americas; working under the scorching sun on plantations, getting whipped as a punishment is commonplace; wages are mysteriously withheld; and contract are mysteriously extended. Bonded Slavery continued after the Indenture, negating the abolition of the Indian Indenture in 1920. (and the Viceroy, Chelmsford, admitted it was only being done due to economic disadvantage, NOT goodwill.)

**S\\*xual Slavery**

![img](xueuk4jq87wc1)

Type 1: Women and even young girls are kidnapped in broad daylight by soldiers to cantonments, where they are r\\*ped. Rigorous ID system and “medical checks” only for girls, not for male soldiers. “Justification” is a deterrent to homosexuality.

Type 2, the Devadasi, is a female Hindu artist who is dedicated to the worship or service of a deity or a temple for the rest of her life. They were forced into s\\*xual slavery by the British after they defeated the patrons of the temple, the Kings. Even when the British passed the “Bombay Devadasi Protection Act, 1934, they didn't even enforce the law, “justifying” it with “confusion between Devadsai and non-religious street dancers.”.

Indian Members of the Imperial Legislative Council passed the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, fixing the age of marriage for girls at 14 years and boys at 18 years. The British were enraged... They did not enforce the law, “justifying” it by losing support from Hindus and Muslims.

**Prison Slavery**

![img](ytj39ndu87wc1)

Their only crime fighting for their freedom, men, women, and children are sent to horrific prisons, where not only are they subject to inhumane torture, dehumanization, unethical human experimentation (intentional exposure to malaria, typhoid, plague, dysentery, and testing “cures” that only made the subject worse AND brutal electrical shocks for “mad patients” AND being “drowned in food and milk”), a jail “diet” with literal kerosene inside, but also backbreaking slave labor, e.g., oil mills. They are expected to extract more oil than a literal bull! Or grinding coconuts , which literally drove some insane.

**Famine “Relief” Camps**

![img](e1gc4q3y87wc1)

From the late 19th century, continuing well into the 1930s and 1940s, these horrific camps existed. Basically, after waiting for a few hundred thousand or a few million deaths in famines (of their own exacerbation due to exporting food), the British would set up these Famine “Relief” Camps, thousands of miles away from famine-stricken villages. If the already starving Indians managed to reach the camp, they would be literally forced to perform excruciating slave labor for a ration lower than Buchenwald, with literally zero nutritional value. Couple that with the overcrowding, lack of sanitation and hygiene, and even unethical human experimentation (e.g., they forcibly divided families, one outside the camp and one inside the camp, and questioned, ""Hmm, in both cases, will they starve?"". (Not so fun fact, they did.)

So it’s no surprise that the mortality rates for some of the camps were as high as 94%! Only made the suffering of the starving Indians worse.

In 1935, a prominent British nutritionist stationed in India, W.R. Aykroyd, tried to put an end to this practice by giving rations of actually nutritious value, but he was flat-out ignored by his higher-ups.

Of course, in independent India, famines are extremely rare, so these camps were shut down and dismantled.

**Criminal Tribes Acts**

![img](5pt1vpb197wc1)

1871 onwards: One of the most draconian acts of the Raj, this categorized millions of people from various communities (mostly nomadic and semi-nomadic but also transgender people) as “criminals by birth.”. At first, they were subject to weekly reporting to the police, more discrimination than other Indians, awful police brutality, and surveillance.

However, in 1897 onwards, cultural genocide started through the legal kidnapping of children into so-called “reformatory” settlements.

From 1908 on, slavery was introduced in this act through forced resettlement to “special” settlements—slave labor camps. They were confined to essentially being enslaved for the rest of their lives.

In Independent India, while these communities still suffer to an extent from the pre-1897 actions, there are thankfully no more “reformatory” and “special” settlements.

**Land Revenue Systems (most notably and long-lastingly, the Zamindari System)**

![img](ssyjewta97wc1)

* **Zamindari System**. Although it existed before British rule, the British made it in its most infamous form, the Permanent Settlement of 1793. The Zamindari System involved the British granting large and fertile tracts of land to feudal lords known as ""Zamindars.”. They were responsible for collecting revenue for the millions of  peasants working on the land and then paying a fixed amount to their British higher-ups. Sometimes there were “sub zamindars” between the peasants and Zamindars with varying degrees of power. However, the Zamindars severely exploited the peasants, imposing extremely high taxes on them and trapping them in a cycle of debt and poverty. And the British were fully complicit with them, and of course they profited the most out of this slavery. Only abolished after Independence.
* **Ryotwari System**. Introduced in the 1820s. It was meant to eliminate the Zamindar middleman between the peasants and the British; however, it came with its own drawbacks, as the rates for taxes were guaranteed to be 50% in the dryland and 60% in the wetland, so if the farmer had a bad harvest, well, good luck. To try and avoid this, peasants took loans from moneylenders, who of course didn't give any sh\\*t about them being happy to exploit. So it was a lose-lose situation for the peasants. It was replaced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by similar systems to the Zamindari System!
* **The Mahalwari System** was introduced in 1822. The Mahalwari System was intended to protect village autonomy by making them the ones paying taxes directly to the state. However, since the British were absolute buffoons in their “assumptions” about the land area and crop yield in the system, this led to widespread corruption and exploitation. It had the same fate as the Ryotwari. “Out of the frying pan and into the fire.”

# MYTH #2: ""SURE, THE LAISSEZ-FAIRE POLICIES OF THE BRITISH LED TO GREAT FAMINES IN INDIA THROUGHOUT THE LATE 19TH CENTURY, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FAMINE CODES ERADICATED THIS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ""SPECIAL"" CASE OF BENGAL IN 1943.""

I won’t go over Bengal 1943, as that is the topic for another post. There are a plethora of myths perpetuated by apologists, but I will go over the main part of this myth.

Quick terminology: A famine is considered a “great famine” if it has 1,000,000+ deaths.

First of all, if the Famine Codes eradicated the Great Famines, then what was the need for the “Relief” Camps to continue well into the 1930s and 1940s? (the picture of a “relief” camp is from 1936, Bengal.)

Or why did Aykroyd (unsuccessfully) recommend making the rations humane? It makes you wonder.

Let us quickly go over Bengal during the 1930s.

Between 1931 and 1942 (pic below), there were a “string” of famines which culminated in minimum 1 Million deaths; essentially, there was the equivalent of a Great Famine happening each year in Bengal alone this timeframe. Dispels the myth completely.

From “THE DEMOGRAPHY OF INDIAN FAMINES: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE” BY

ARUP MAHARATNA

LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

A THESIS SUBMITTED FOR THE DEGREE OF PH.D. IN DEMOGRAPHY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON 1992”

From Bengal, we go to Madras.

Between 1922 and the beginning of World War II, famine visited parts of Madras five more times: in 1924, 1931–32, 1934–35, 1937–38, and 1938–39.

R. Suryanarayana Rao, a member of the SIS and Social Service League of Madras, pushed for more Indian contribution to relief than the horrible camps set up by the British. He was a vocal critic of the Madras Famine Code, and rightfully so.

In 1937, the Government of India Act 1935 commenced, which, although still retained British superiority and even had some  regressions (Churchill described the broad sweep of “emergency” powers given to Lord Linlithglow as “likely to rouse Mussolini’s envy”), it gave some concessions to Indians, i.e., more provincial autonomy.

This was good news for Rao:

*Rao joined the* ***Madras Famine Code Revision Committee in 1938***\\*, when parts of Madras were still in the midst of a famine. Alarmed by the\\* ***scale of the famine that affected several districts at once***\\*, the committee evaluated the current response and reached the conclusion that a “**bolder policy” was needed**. It offered\\* ***far-reaching recommendations for the reform of the provincial famine code***\\*, such as the\\* ***abolition of the grain equivalent and the increase of wages and rations***\\*. It noted that\\* ***women workers received an insufficient amount of calories*** *and that* ***children’s rations lacked fat***\\*. It also pointed out that the\\* ***allowances of vegetables were lower than in jail diets and thus generally insufficient***\\*.

China’s foreign policy strategy has evolved over different periods.

**From 1949 to the 1980s**, China’s primary foreign policy principle was ""defense through offense."" In essence, this meant:

- ""Don't attack my homeland or challenge my sovereignty, and don’t try to isolate me from the global system to strangle me. If I sense you’re trying to do any of these, I’ll attack you. I know my performance over the past century has been poor, and I’m aware that my foundation is still weak, but that doesn’t mean I’ll show weakness. On the contrary, I’ll act unpredictably and aggressively. I won’t wait for you to escalate step by step; I’ll take the initiative and do something big suddenly. You might find me overly aggressive and irrational, but I’ll eventually pull back— only after making you pay a heavy price and leaving you with long-term psychological trauma.""

- ""When I feel secure and no longer isolated from the global system, I’ll settle down. Then you’ll realize that I can be quite peaceful because my fundamental goal is defensive: to protect China’s core and ensure my access to global development opportunities. If you don’t understand me, we’ll just keep wearing each other down. I’ll pay a heavy price too, but this is the best choice I can make after weighing all the harms.""

- ""Whether it’s the Soviet Union or the U.S., the more powerful you are, the more I’ll dare to confront you, betting that you won't risk too much for another power’s gain. Middle powers shouldn’t think they can deal with me just because I’m facing the U.S. and the USSR. Apart from them, everyone else is much weaker than me, and I can handle you with a secondary force. Just look at India and Vietnam.""

During this period, the most striking impression of China in the West was its extreme aggressiveness.

Henry Kissinger was one of the first to understand China. He noted that the Chinese volunteer army’s sudden intervention in Korea to strike U.S. forces seemed like a highly conspiratorial offensive. China's shelling of Kinmen seemed like a deliberate provocation of war. Its global revolutionary export appeared aimed at promoting worldwide communism. The Sino-Soviet ideological debates seemed like a struggle for orthodoxy. But underlying all these actions was defense, albeit through aggressive means. Therefore, negotiating with China was entirely possible. With Kissinger and Nixon's efforts, the U.S. sorted out its security relationship with China before the USSR did. The Soviets never managed to rectify this until it was too late, which I discuss in another article. By the late 1980s, China had largely achieved its two major defensive goals: homeland security and integration into the global system.

**From the late 1980s to now**, China’s primary foreign policy principle has been ""winning through speed."" This can be explained as:

- ""My homeland is secure, and I have a place in the global development environment. Now I want to make money and develop. I’m willing to make concessions if they benefit these two goals. I don’t care much if you criticize me because making money is more important than saving face. I can tolerate minor losses because I believe that with development, the future will be mine. I can stay composed if you try to destabilize me because I’m growing rapidly. I’m not afraid of your threats because you won’t want to fight me to the death. If you push too hard, I might lash out briefly, but then I’ll get back to business. I might seem timid and lacking confidence, but I’m growing quickly, so I’ll still win.""

- ""When I’ve fully developed, I’ll be able to hold my head high. At that point, you’ll see that I’m quite capable of making waves. As for specific goals, I haven’t decided yet; I’ll let future generations figure that out. If you don’t understand my grand ambitions, just wait for my peaceful evolution. Even if you see through me, it won’t matter because most of you won’t realize it until I’ve achieved my goals. I know my actions might disappoint many of my people and cause confusion, but this is the choice that maximizes my benefits after careful consideration.""

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, China has rapidly realigned its grand strategy, securing a Sino-Russian security bloc. In the short term, this was defensive, but in the long term, it was a strong offensive against the U.S. (though the short-term goal might have been the initial intent). By the late 1990s, China had ambitious military plans. After joining the WTO in 2001, China launched an economic offensive to capture market share. Since 2008, China has mounted a complex political, geographical, and economic offensive against the U.S. In 2016, it escalated to a strong military standoff with the U.S.

During this period , the most striking impression of China in the West has been its incredible speed. The rapid growth of China’s military capabilities, its increasing economic integration, its global political influence, its strategic positioning in its surrounding regions, its adjustments to interest groups, and its handling of the pandemic—all have been remarkably swift. The U.S. often found itself either unable to react in time or forced into hasty, poorly coordinated responses. Simply comparing the raw power of the U.S. to China’s isn’t sufficient. Aside from any exaggerations, the mere fact that “plans can’t keep up with changes” has made it difficult for the U.S. to effectively leverage its strength.

From what I’ve seen online, it’s only in recent years that Western mainstream elites have begun to understand China’s high level of ambition. Some have realized that a new phase of Chinese assertiveness is imminent, and a few have even developed a kind of Lovecraftian fear about China’s goals. However, most have yet to find an effective strategy to counter this (I believe there’s only one clear path), and currently, they’re still in a state of frantic disarray. A few smart individuals might have figured it out, but no one with significant influence has dared to speak out. Whether there’s some deep state secretly pushing for action remains unknown.

The guiding principle of ""winning through speed"" is likely to continue until the 2030s. Beyond that, I speculate that it will evolve into ""exercising power to establish order.""

"Amit Shah is the main villain for 2024 BJP Poll results! Due to personal rivalry with Yogiji to become next PM after Modiji, the Motabhai took PM's affection as license to bulldoze all candidates, listed by UP CM Yogiji and fielded own candidates through BJP Prez.

N.B: Low voter turnout was also responsibility of the Home Ministry and yet they left Feb-Mar just after Ram Mandir when there was some wave in Govt's favour and asked EC for election on Apr-May (both in 2014 & 2019 election happened a month earlier) for votes when there was intense heat waves so that lowest ever turnout happen because in 5G age an issue doesn't remain relevant beyond 2 months unlike the 1980s or 1990s!",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4ZFRPbGE3T21ocTR3cnl2cnhwWmk3SDFDZ040bmo5d0xmUWFKWmp6TjEyem5kWFF6NWlmNlhiTVhKSk80ZDJUeDZNeHByTVJIcHI3RG5WX2Q4c1dSSFE9PQ==

They did these in most of rural areas and people had to vote in front of TMC goons by showing them where they voted, whereas BJP got the votes mostly from urban areas where EC, administration, observers, media, etc were present to thwart that.

After wholesale rigging the TMC goons then, themselves give 5-10% votes to BJP in lawless rural areas to show that opposition also got some votes and this is called in West Bengal as ""Scientific Rigging"" originally invented by CPM

Fake allegations of molestation by female TMC workers against CAPFs is another ploy to intimidate them

Even when EVM & VVPATs are thrown in ponds, the EC to hide their inefficiency say that they are reserve machines but Mamata & her nephew's goons & IPAC men supporting them along with state police are not fools

Instead of such farcical polls, the incompetent ECI should have declared TMC unanimous winners in all 42 MP seats and then atleast common people would not have suffered like these",r/indiarwresources,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJ4SUstVzFzWTlpSjgwTWxXWWNObkNJZC0xZzFjSm80TFo0WG9hVUFEOG1YanpWTmEwUWlIajNzZDN4REFjVV8yZVR4WTVyc012VWhzSnNPSHNTMmZUVlE9PQ==

I do not consider Khalistanis as Sikhs. They are not. They are colluding with Pakistan which has the reputation of massacring Sikhs during partition and driving them out to India. Muslim tyrants persecuted the Sikh gurus and these guys are aligning with Islamists. What a hypocrisy. They are into drug trafficking through Pakistan into Indian Punjab and generate money through it. Most are second and third generation bone heads born in Canada and UK. They do not have the courage to demand a homeland inside Pakistan where their major history and origin is. Guru Nanak's birthplace is in Pakistan. Lahore was the capital of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

"**Request from the mods:**

It's always disappointing when we come across a great comment on another sub, and try to find it again, only to find it's been removed by some butthurt mod. So aside from making this a hub for great arguments and knowledge, let's also make this an ARCHIVE too - a repository and backup of great informative/useful content, by yourself or others.

Our request is that we all try to avoid crossposting wherever possible - because if a user wipes their comment history, or a mod nukes a comment thread, or an entire post simply vanishes, or a whole sub gets banned, or a site is inaccessible, then we'll just have a lovely collection of dead links that lead to nowhere.

So let's NOT crosspost anymore. Although I will not disable crossposting for now, I would really like for all of us to avoid using it unless you're in a hurry and will repost it properly later. 

If possible, you can copy-paste the content as a comment below this.
