ML-4 90-100 outstanding

DETECT

Example: missing one check in ML-0 but passed all ML-1 checks still keep you at ML-0.

Suggestion:
Make interview questions subjective and not count towards a ML. This gives a better understanding of what the site needs to polish up on.

When conducting a cyber review. It's best to give the site a workbook on what's expected and what you will be looking at/for. This gives time for policies to be updated and no surprises.

"Most STEM internships are paid jobs in the $13-20/hr range (at least, that was the case for the job market when I was looking for an internship). Job hunting is hard, but if you put the time and effort in you should be able to find something. Just be careful that you don't overload yourself with all of the things you're planning.

"IP's change all the time.    
The vast majority of the world uses variable IP addresses.    
Which means that each time you disconnect your mobile phone for example from wifi and gsm networks, then reconnect between 10 minutes to 24 hours later (depending on some variables). You get a new ip address.    
    
The same goes for your home router.    
Disconnect it for the amount of time your ISP or network provider has set for your ip to release and then reconnect it, then you'll have a new ip address.    
    
The only cases where static ip addresses are widely used are when companies have either bought ip addresses or have leased them from the ISP or Network provider.    
    
So...    
IP addresses change, a lot... Which means that any ip addresses you have or any ip address you've collected might as well be used by someone else.    
But it might not be someone else's yet, it all depends how long the ISP lets a device hold the ip address, how long the device has had an uninterrupted internet connection and much much more.",r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI0eGRNS0U3MWdXYVNRc2NuRmNJUUozN3RIUnhkcDMwaXd3SThjNkVZdWFrWUxWRmZRQmoteGpRU0hBRkVJZ3c2Uzl1WFlhWHZJSldNZHFpLUdMSVFWRkE9PQ==

"You should do what you feel is right. It may limit your ability to rise in the ranks at your current job, but it's not going to impact your career negatively. 

What it will do it impact your integrity and your ability to sleep soundly at night if you compromise your internal values.

"As a professional, it is a moral and ethical decision. Your organization is trying to become framework certified. It is a worthy goal of any organization. However, a lie by omission on your part is still a lie.  You need to come to terms with whichever way you go.  It is a no win situation for you regardless of which decision you make - you lie and you need to live with it...you tell the truth and you jeopardize the organization's ability to get certified. 

If you do decide to tell the truth, for sake of transparency with the CIO, you should tell him either immediately before or after you tell the assessor.  That way he can begin to formulate how to fill the gap.  He is probably going to be pissed at you, but you will have a clean conscious. 

Document everything.",r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHZjFZdGRKcHRCYngwSGxmRWpVTDZScDQ3NGtHQUZ0S3MySEJlSkQxbmYxLXJjT0NINE9FMksyaWFOaEo3NVl1dUkzeTI4YThnQktadVliaW5tNU4wdFp4c0hUeHVOUDRDUF9sNXVXZjVrNzQ9
"The risk will go into our corporate risk register. Essentially we are so close to audit that when (I’m avoiding using “if” on purpose as it’s so obvious) the auditor discovers there’s no evidence that any of the processes have been followed it will most certainly result in a major non-conformity and failure. The only way of bringing it back is to say that we’ve discovered the issue in our latest internal audit and having done so, a risk has been raised, staff are beginning to work following the processes and if certified, we will be able to produce evidence in our annual audit next year. Outside of causing embarrassment, my theory is that transparency with a remediation plan might be our saving grace. Not reporting will surely result in failure.",r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNHUUt0S2VNLVNyeThaS04tWGotV0lROFJjTVlxazJzT2tfcERhNUJtNjBScDZFclppdklTOWV0a0pXU1c3ZlNMTWEtOXVhU1IzRWNEM0VuWFdBVWt1bzBSNUR6d3UzdmdxR1pra3F1VGVaVVE9

"Generally speaking, when hardware tokens are sent they are shipped without the seed files.  Upon arrival the recipient then requests their seed file using an online form, and after supplying their order details the seed file is sent to the email address that was confirmed during the initial order.

As the tokens cannot be used without the seed data this is pretty secure, but if additional security is needed you could consider using programmable tokens.  With programmable tokens you can generate random seeds yourself.",r/information_security,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNRTFIyWjRQZG04WlliRnZUTy1DNFcxRDV5Q0RUaGc3aWZzYzhFTi1rdzNhV19iTUoxSndLV2JodWFfaldYUzF3YVdibEpHRDVPZk03SXhGOUhuOW1Rd2c9PQ==
