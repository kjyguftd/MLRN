"What are you interested in?

Something fun or helpful?

1) There is a nanotube sponge material has been developed nearly a decade ago that could clean up oil spills, but a delivery system was never devised. I have a simple autonomous drone design for it that could clean up large or small oil spills.

2) large scale drip irrigation could solve the West water shortage problem. I have drafted a mobile 3D printing option that could make it much cheaper and easier to deploy. If it was adopted at even 80% of farms, it would save more water than all residential and commercial water usage in the Western US combined.

3) For fun, you could have an electronic embedded shirt that would have touch sensors for drums, a keyboard, or a guitar that could play notes when touched. You could have a full band with just the shirts people are wearing. It would be simple enough to make a functional mock up for the competition.

"Okay, so, lots to unpack here.

Firstly, separate logical thinking and problem solving. These are different mental skills. Problem solving usually involves discipline to stick to a problem definition approach, the intelligence to find the insights that render the problem solvable, the wisdom to separate the important insights from the noise, and the creativity & divergent thinking to evaluate multiple solutions.

Logical thinking, per the traditions of formal logic, are more about proper processing of evidence and assumptions while remaining cognizant of (and attempting to avoid) the logical fallacies that constantly lay in wait to trip humans up.

I am a deeply logical human and formally trained in analytical philosophy and this is not something that most people want and appreciate, practically, in the real world. The most logical person you know is either a terrible pedant or a misanthrope.

So, let’s stick with problem solving.

What you would want to do is identify how many meaningful questions a person could ask in response to a problem, how they might go about attempting to develop learning against those questions, and the quantity of possible solutions pathways they would consider.

You could pick a handful of thorny problems and write approaches to each.

And in ancient times, the first step in being a genius was to be independently wealthy. Otherwise, you were never educated — possibly illiterate — and toiled. When you were wealthy, you now had to decide whether to focus on the affairs of the day or on the theoretical learning. It is the theoretical learning that survives with a name attached. But know that some human devised and designed the Roman aqueducts. We don’t know who, but they were every bit the genius of the theoretical scholars.

"Hello ! i've asked gemini here's the framework that it gave to me   
Urban Farms: Cultivating Freshness in the City  
Problem:  
Growing populations and urban sprawl are putting pressure on traditional agricultural land, leading to:  
Increased food insecurity: Difficulty accessing fresh, healthy produce, especially in underserved communities.  
Environmental concerns: Long-distance transportation of food contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and fuel dependence.  
Disconnection from food sources: Lack of understanding about where food comes from and how it's grown.  
Solution:  
Urban Farms offer a innovative approach to food production by utilizing vacant land or underused spaces within city limits for growing fresh, sustainable produce. This concept encompasses various methods, including:  
Rooftop gardens: Utilizing rooftops of buildings for growing vegetables, fruits, and herbs.  
Vertical farming: Stacking growing layers to maximize space and resource efficiency.  
Community gardens: Creating shared spaces for residents to grow their own food and foster social connections.  
Aquaponics: Combining aquaculture (fish farming) with hydroponics (growing plants without soil) in a closed system.  
Benefits:  
Increased access to fresh, healthy food: Urban farms provide local communities with readily available, high-quality produce, addressing food insecurity concerns.  
Reduced environmental impact: Shorter transportation distances decrease carbon footprint and reliance on fossil fuels.  
Enhanced community development: Urban farms can become vibrant community hubs, promoting social interaction, education, and green spaces within cities.  
Improved public health: Increased access to fresh produce encourages healthier eating habits and combats diet-related illnesses.  
Target Market:  
Urban residents seeking access to fresh, local produce.  
Restaurants and businesses aiming for sustainable sourcing.  
Community organizations promoting healthy eating and social engagement.  
Individuals interested in learning about and participating in urban agriculture.  
Marketing Strategy:  
Partner with local businesses and restaurants to showcase the farm's produce.  
Organize educational workshops and tours to raise awareness about urban farming benefits.  
Utilize social media platforms to connect with the community and share the farm's story.  
Collaborate with schools and community centers to integrate urban farming into educational programs.  
By establishing Urban Farms, you can address critical issues related to food access, sustainability, and community development, while offering a unique and impactful business opportunity.  
Note: This is just a starting point, and you can further develop this concept by including details about:  
Specific type of urban farm you envision (rooftop, vertical, etc.)  
Target crops and production methods  
Business model and revenue streams  
Community engagement initiatives  
Potential challenges and mitigation strategies  
Remember, a strong business plan requires thorough research, competitor analysis, and financial projections.

"While I think this is true for the most part, I think Christensen is looking at a larger phenomenon through the keyhole of innovation.

There is a Champion-Challenger dynamic at play. The current Champion has the winning formula for the current market. To remain the Champion, they need to derive the winning formula for the future market. There are usually very few Champions and they are usually large and powerful in their domains.

Meanwhile, there is a much larger number of Challengers who are pursuing a variety of strategies. Where the Champions are uniform in their fitness to the current market, Challengers are diverse. As the environment shifts, pure dumb luck can make a Challenger into a Champion.

Sticking with Christensen’s obsession with the chip market, consider Intel and Nvidia. Nvidia was a bit player (pun intended) until first bitcoin mining and now generative AI have sent demand for their chips to the stratosphere.

It wasn’t brilliant innovation on Nvidia’s part or a failure to innovate on Intel’s part, but a change in the customer needs that is driving the differential performance.

While I am a professor innovator (it’s how I pay the rent), I often see the market forces more in terms of biology — natural selection and evolutionary forces, specifically the slow Lamarckian adaptation of existing firms and the periodic (often seemingly spontaneous) growth of nascent firms.

I then see the executives issue as less of an Innovators Dilemma and more of a Diversification Dilemma.

Innovation comes from a particularly mature mindset - think: top of Maslow’s hierarchy. Steve Jobs and Henry Ford were both examples. There are a few issues: Society values fitting in more than we value complex problem solving. We don’t naturally value those people. They don’t “fit in” with a lot of society because they think differently. Lots of them are women and PoC and they’re valued even less.

"I agree with you we need to promote entrepreneurship, but we need to address reality too. There is an overwhelming sense among Americans and especially younger people that ""If it was a good idea then the big companies would already be doing it and if no one else is doing it that means they already looked at it and decided it won't work."" Any time you are trying to promote entrepreneurship you have to make sure that you let people know that corporate America is extremely lazy and stupid, and it's run by sociopaths who don't invest in anything over the long term and are always looking for the quick buck. Just because something isn't being done doesn't mean it's not a good idea. It just means that people who have the same mentality as Donald Trump were too stupid to understand the concept.

Now this is no longer the case with PCs, and likely with smartphones. 

I used to want the best smartphone 7 years ago, this year I seriously considered an A54 (a second tier Samsung device) but decided to go with an S24 because of the guaranteed 7 years support. I am quite confident an A54 would have served me quite well. 

A mature product is one where it no longer makes sense to go for the best/latest gadget, and I think this is the greatest challenge for smartphone makers all around the world. 

I know that for any business, the ability to differentiate is critical. I expect a lot of hardware makers to embrace anything that would help them do this. So, yes, I can see a ton of AI in future devices. In a way it's unfortunate because a market leader costs out there for the sensible Toyota buyer -  ie. for a car that is reliable and doesn't cost a ton. Because AI is expensive and has a virtually zero cost per extra unit, I expect to see a ton of it.",r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTN0w1LXJveHlpZW40RHpjcjZrVnFlN3FCNkhkN2ltWkZ6QkJEZl95Nk0xMzhzdS0tTXNrUlI5c1FUWWxwWTVsanptVHBNSW9yN2pwWlEwVzdTVmlZM3c9PQ==

"simplest definition that I use
Innovation is applied invention.  
Slightly more complicated
Applied innovation that has some benefit to someone, it does not need to be net positive, but must provide some benefit to be considered innovation.",r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGJTSUpCX0p4bUlScm5DNFNkS2owaVZLVzdkSU0xY3R4TUU4TGhHNGJEeWRmei1DUVhEOS00Wl9FUXpDcXdocmlMZWdMbkZNOWFsUmFfTWRHOW9IMXFrMXc9PQ==

"the idea is interesting conceptually. I'd be interested in knowing how reliable it is over time and how balanced it is it different ""loaded"" configurations.

"Bit of advice: people don't really change. All of the great innovations in understanding human behavior happened before 1970.

"This seems like a great opportunity to practice it yourself.  Just start listing things around you and imagine what it would be like to combine two or more of them.  

A broom that functions like an electric toothbrush. 
A trash can + toilet paper holder.
A knife + metal file.
A spray bottle for your morning coffee.
A roll of tape made of hot glue with a heating element to melt the glue as you unroll it. 

I can do this all day, but I’ve had a lot of practice.  Try to come up with some yourself. :)",r/innovation,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGI2OUpqU1pCVXFlNGVXUXMtcXM2YVZObVhSNEwwZ2lZc0sxVWJvOTdxY3k0T2VLcG16LXQ4Z1JwMVpCMm9lQlc3UnNQVmRUMGlEX1JYbHR6c0lURlBUM2c9PQ==
