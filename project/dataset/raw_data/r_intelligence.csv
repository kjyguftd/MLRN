2) Just based on how you described not wanting to explain what *you think* should be obvious about being a police officer (and your other roles too, I'm guessing) strongly suggests a weak resume that doesn't communicate how *being a police officer and ex mil translates to a good hire for intel.*


3) Also, just stating the job description for a resume is not enough. You must communicate how you improved or decreased something for a meaningful impact (30% increase in arrests on your beat, contribute to ops that resulted in a 10% decrease in violent crime, etc.). Look up the XYZ format for better resume bullets.


4) Not sure what you did in the military but I'm guessing that as a cop you either used or researched or otherwise had access to closed LE databases, maybe you did some crime analysis, maybe you took insights from crime analysis (intel analysis really) and acted on them (intel ops?). 


If you see what I'm getting at with that last item, I think you'll start to realize that there is a lot of overlap with LE operations and intel operations particularly with methods for analyzing data and doing actual ops based on crime analysis.

"The resume is likely being run through a computer program that scans for key words and to weed out those who may not fit the requirements.

You probably need to add descriptions for the jobs you have done, it‚Äôs just dot points with say 10-25 words each. Pack these sentences with key words so that they get highlighted by the scanning software.

 Canada	1.37%

"IIRC by its very definition, US federally classified materials can‚Äôt be classified so that the president can‚Äôt access it, because all classified materials are classified under legal authority established by executive order. So, technically, the president can selectively declassify anything so that they can see it which means in practice, the president, by virtue of his presidential authority, has de facto access to everything classified.

Notice how none of that actually requires the president to have a security clearance. I think I heard somewhere that the president doesn‚Äôt go through the security clearance SSBI process as everyone else, because their ability to access information is inherent to their office, so they don‚Äôt actually hold a clearance while president.

"It makes perfect sense; there is no eligibility requirement in the Constitution that you be able to pass a security background check to be president or chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence or to be a federal judge overseeing a case where the Classified Information Procedures Act has been invoked. These positions are constitutional officers and the only requirements are spelled out in the Constitution.

The classification rules and system applies to *employees* of the federal government who are accessing classified information under rules and procedures created by the president. The president is the original and final classification authority; they are also the elected representative of the American people. The very idea of classification stems from the president's authority. E.g. the president's authority to classify information is vested in him as a person, and he is delegating it to the various entities in the federal bureaucracy.
