International law, especially Geneva Convention as well as jus cogens norms provide the legal framework which gives much stronger and more robust protections than any agreement between Palestinians and Israelis.

"This will definitely slow down the process. Prosecutor will probably respond to these submissions and depending on how much time Pre-Trial Chamber devotes to this issue we may have to wait for the decision for a couple of months. I certainly hope Pre-Trial Chamber will not reject the request on jurisdictional grounds.

As for their arguments, this was already repeated when the Pre-Trial Chamber was deciding on jurisdiction to open investigation. It seems that decision didn't entirely settle the point, but there are very good reasons to think UK is wrong about this.

They're essentially claiming that because Oslo Agreement stipulated Palestinians would not have jurisdiction over Israeli citizens, they do not have that authority and thus cannot delegate it to ICC.

As this article [points out](https://opiniojuris.org/2020/06/10/are-the-oslo-accords-still-valid-for-the-icc-and-palestine-it-should-not-matter/) (and even an Israeli scholar seems to agree), there is a distinction between prescriptive jurisdiction (to make law) and enforcement jurisdiction. Bilateral agreements affect enforcement jurisdiction. ICC's jurisdiction stems from prescriptive one.

Second problem is that this interpretation of Oslo is incompatible with provisions of Fourth Geneva Convention, which requires High Contracting Parties to prosecute grave breaches and provides that any agreements with occupying power cannot deprive protected persons of benefits of the Convention. Simply put, Palestinians cannot renounce the right to prosecute war crimes through an agreement with Israel.

It should be noted that the specified provision of Oslo, which places citizens of another state entirely outside of the criminal jurisdiction of Palestine is largely unheard of in any other modern context (this is much broader than SOFA agreements because it also applies to civilians). 

No state unless it has been coerced would ever agree to anything similar. It's entirely the product of force. It's absurd to argue it's a legal impediment to ICC.

Why? I can see the similarity between domestic jurisdiction and ICC's pooling of jurisdiction - lot of territorial and personal jurisdiction delegated to one institution.

">The ICC ruled in 2021 that they have yet to finalize whether or not Palestine is a state, as based on the Oslo Accords, it is not, and based on some international bodies it is.

That's not exactly correct. Court ruled that Palestine is a state party to the Statute. The reasoning is somewhat complicated, but ICC didn't decide whether Palestine was a state under general international law.

>The consequences of Palestine being a state without an agreement with Israel depends on how Israel responds. israel coould assume that since a major clause is being violated, the whole agreement is null.

Implicit assumption here is that Israel's agreement has a decisive role in determining if, legally, Palestine is a state, as if Israeli permission is required. It is not. Even theory of statehood that demands recognition as a requisite for statehood doesn't require recognition from any specific state and Palestine is recognized by 75% of UN members. A grand total of 8 UN states voted against the resolution saying Palestine should become a member (only open to states).

The only conceivable scenario where recognition by one particular state can be decisive is case of unilateral secession, but that's not what is going in this case because Israel has never claimed territory of State of Palestine belongs to Israel.

>Remember, Pre Oslo, PLO and the PA wasn't international recognized

That's false. Just by looking at the Wikipedia page you can see that before 1990, as many as 90 states had already recognized Palestine.

>The PA as a governing body is not self sufficient without money coming from Israel, water from Israel, and from Israel's export/import taxes and from international donors.

Without diving into a rabbit hole, the world recognizes israel's borders of jordan, egypt, syria and they encompass whatever land palestine would claim in the west bank.  Anyways its complicated.

"You are fundamentally misrepresenting the ratio decidendi of the PTC 19(2) decision.

Furthermore, I find your logic here fundamentally flawed. If the Oslo Accords do not recognize Palestine as a State, then it is not a treaty, and it does not bind it. It is at most an agreement imposed by an occupying force following the Geneva Conventions. The operative instrument to the PTC was the UN recognition of Palestine as an observer State, status which allowed it to participate to any open ratification treaty for whom the UNSG was registrar.

"The UK is not contesting that Palestine is member of the Rome Statute (the appropriate time for that was within 6  months of Palestine joining). It is contesting it can exercise jurisdiction against Israeli soldiers committing art. 5 crimes in Palestine.

Essentially, art.12 of the Rome Statute provides that crimes occuring on the territory or by the national of a member state fall under the Court’s jurisdiction. Israel has signed but not ratified the Statute, so the latter one is out. However, normally, crimes committed by Israelis on Palestinian territory would be under the jurisdiction. What the UK is arguing here is that under the Oslo accords, Palestine cannot exercise jurisdiction over Israelis. Therefore, it cannot delegate to the Court a power it doesn’t have itself.

As for internationally recognized borders, Israel’s are the 1967 ones, see ICJ Wall Advisory Opinion. The West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza are presently occupied by Israel in contravention to International law. This was also true before the Oslo Accords, as States cannot gain territory by invasion under PIL.

This makes sense because State *can* apply its law extraterritoriality to its citizens, and States are bound to comply with international treaties (like the Rome Statute) even if they contradict state's internal law. By ratifying Rome Statute state is effectively legislating - defining criminal offenses and setting up a court to prosecute them.

"I’ve left the ICC close to a year now, so things aren’t as fresh in my memory as they used to be - apologies.

But essentially, there is a shade of monism vs dualism in the debate. International crimes, whose prevention, prohibition and punishment are *jus cogens* obligations, do not technically need either prescriptive, adjudicative or enforcement jurisdiction to be delegated by the States: look for instance at the Tadic interlocutory appeal on jurisdiction, the fact they are universal jurisdiction, or the fact the principle of legality is purely on the substantive law and not procedural law whatsoever (Al Hassan, not sure which decision on the top of my head). 

Some like Kai Ambos and (especially) Carsten Stahn argue that the ICC is using a moderated form of this power, and that ratifying the Statute is accepting the competence of the ICC to exercise (complementarily) this personal jurisdiction which stems purely from International law. Therefore, what powers said State grants itself is only a self-limitation to its capacity to exercise jurisdiction on international crimes (for instance, look at most national laws regarding universal jurisdiction, which ask for a link which is not required in PIL). This limitation would not impact the ICC’s own powers.

For others of course, the ICC is not a ""true"" international tribunal (unlike the ICTY/ICTR I guess) and therefore, is only being delegated the domestic enforcement powers of the State. 

I’m too tired to search but I think Stahn has written an article on that subject in 2016 or 2017 in response to another author - worth checking out. It will be more legible than my tired second language can be.

Of course, to me, the latter reading would also mean that personal immunities could apply here like in the ICJ DRC immunity case, as the logic would be fundamentally similar to that of the Oslo Accords blocking enforcement.

No country (Israel included) claims West Bank is a part of Israel. They all maintain Israel's territory is within the Green Line. Jordan for example renounced territory west of river Jordan when it signed a peace treaty with Israel but that treaty doesn't say everything west of that river is Israel - just that it's Jordan's western border. 

Only difference is that Israel says occupied territories are ""disputed"" because they're disputing Palestine is a state, but it would a very awkward dispute where only one state is actually claiming territory.

Oslo Accords didn't actually resolve any status issues they were supposed to be an interim agreement before a final settlement was reached. The division of into zones is a technical security arrangement it does not grant any sovereignty.

This is a remarkably good point that is completely ignored by those who raise Oslo Accords as an obstacle to statehood.

International treaties can only be entered into between states and international organizations. For Oslo Accords to be a treaty, the other party would have to be a state.

A small detail, genocide and CAH are clearly jus cogens, but to what extent are IHL rules jus cogens? Draft articles say that basic rules are peremptory norms, but what exactly is considered basic rules?

>Therefore, what powers said State grants itself is only a self-limitation to its capacity to exercise jurisdiction on international crimes  
This limitation would not impact the ICC’s own powers.

This is a pretty neat argument. As long as prohibition and punishment are jus cogens, states are allowed and in some cases required to prosecute. Therefore the same applies to ICC. Though I think the extent of jus cogens obligation to prosecute is probably murky. Genocide Convention only imposes that obligation on territorial basis (no obligation to prosecute own citizens for crimes outside of state's territory), whereas Geneva Conventions appear to impose obligation to prosecute any violator that is found on contracting party's territory.

It would seem to me that personal immunity question should be viewed completely separately from jurisdictional issue. Even if states do have a right to prosecute anyone for a violation of IHL/CAH/genocide that took place anywhere personal immunity may still apply.",r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFTXVESngtVlpLWU14NVNRUXdRNGVuXzdjZFhiV3o3Z2ZNbU9hTHhTNjVJUnhhU1Vuak9DdnlLcFBrSGFKQ0dTdHZRLVhyM1FfNmdTLS1EUXo4MG5oWFE9PQ==
"Peremptory norms of international law and ius cogens are, as far as I’m aware, simply synonyms. The ICC has found the Geneva Conventions to be peremptory in at least Al Hassan (probably more), and most of both APs are as well (as is agreed by the Israeli SC in the targeted killings, as well). 

You raise very good points on the limits of ius cogens here, but to me there is a distinction between the obligation to prosecute a case and the possibility to do so. For an easy example, it’s not because grave violations of the GC are universal jurisdiction crimes that there is an obligation under the law of state responsibility to prosecute all war criminals, even on your territory. If a war criminal is on your territory and another state wants to prosecute, then it’s aut dedere aut judicare.

What I’m driving at is that States can give the ICC the authority to excercise a similar kind of international jurisdiction as was started with the IMT and continued with the ICTY/ICTR, this jurisdiction coming from the fact these norms are universal and erga omnes partes. This would not be because (or limited to cases where) the state has the obligation to prosecute a certain case under the laws of state responsibility.

Anyway I’m mainly incoherent at this point of the evening, but I found the [Stahn article](https://scholarship.law.vanderbilt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context=vjtl) I was talking about, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

"Thank you for sharing that article. It is excellent (unsurprising, given its author). 

The text of the Statute seems to favor a universalist reading. Article 12(1), for example, says that ""[a] State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court."" The use of the word ""accept"" implies that the Court's jurisdiction exists independently of a State's accession to the Statute. The State does not grant or vest the Court with jurisdiction that it otherwise would not have, it consents to the exercise of the jurisdiction that the Court inherently possesses. The title of article 12, ""Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction,"" suggests the same thing. State accession to the Rome Statute is necessary for the Court to exercise jurisdiction, but it is not related to the existence of that jurisdiction. Similarly, article 1 says that the Court's powers include exercising its jurisdiction (rather than possessing it) and that the Court's jurisdiction shall be governed (rather than created or granted) by the Rome Statute. This language seems to reflect a recognition that, as Stahn puts it, ""The act of accession to the Statute merely activates the power of the ICC to exercise a jurisdiction grounded in international law.""",r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNFb2FlRlMycWs3UWhmQ3F2bWJFUkgyVnlIRnkweFVkYUFFTzZJUnR0aDRFVTlVRExncHJuMmxXbmVNRXdHQ0ZObFFHNkVla1FST3lVdVdUVHZOUEQ0R1E9PQ==

"There is a litany of misapprehensions here that must be addressed. 

Let me start with the last point: 

>actual genocide doesn't need to occur but the inferred intent of indirect evidence of it occuring is enough to convict seems unreasonable

This is a **complete misunderstanding** of the law on genocide. If there is inferred genocidal intent, then the requirement contained in *chapeau* of Article II that there must be intent is met. 

**If there is inferred genocidal intent** ***plus*** **the commission of any one of the prohibited Article II acts, then** ***actual genocide*** **has taken place.**

That is the law.

>Spain is saying if there is no direct evidence of genocide, inferred intent should be considered genocide.

This is a mischaracterisation of the intent tests. This is not the rule Spain invented, but the one the ICJ has held to be applicable. There are two ways to prove genocidal intent:

1. Direct evidence, failing which
2. Indirect, inferred evidence based on the alleged perpetrator's pattern of conduct 

>Is there any method to counter such claims with the mountain of evidence pointing to contrary conclusions?

A misunderstanding of what the evidence is about. If there's an allegation that a government official said or did not say something, then that official either did or did not say it. If there's evidence of a pattern of conduct or behaviour, either the perpetrators did or did not commit those acts. 

The question is whether one *interprets* that evidence to demonstrate either direct or indirect evidence of genocidal intent. 

>Is the bar for genocide as low as these claims make it out to be ?

There is a bare majority among legal scholars that the bar for finding inferred genocide intent—""the only inference"" test—is too high, not too low. Others think that the bar is set just right.

">Basically Spain is saying if there is no direct evidence of genocide, inferred intent should be considered genocide 

That's not what Spain is saying. Inferring *dolus specialis* is not a new concept and isn't disputed by anyone. Making inferences is a basic judicial function that, at the ICJ, dates back to the Court's first case (Corfu Channel).

In *Croatia v. Serbia*, the Court explained that it can only infer *dolus specialis* if genocidal intent is the ""only reasonable inference"" to be drawn from the evidence. Spain's arguments develop on that statement of law. It makes two main points in para. 25 of its declaration. First, it says that the ""only reasonable inference"" analysis applies only between inferences that are reasonably supported by the evidence. In other words, the alternative inference must have some factual basis in the evidence before the Court. 

Second, it notes that the ""only reasonable inference"" analysis has been applied to patterns of conduct, but not to other evidence of *dolus specialis*, and says that the analysis should not be applied to other evidence.

>Is there any method to counter such claims with the mountain of evidence pointing to contrary conclusions?

The Court weighs the evidence before it. 

>actual genocide doesn't need to occur but the inferred intent of indirect evidence of it occuring is enough to convict seems unreasonable.

This statement seems to be confused. Genocide is an act prohibited by the Genocide Convention perpetrated with *dolus specialis*. These elements of genocide can be established through indirect evidence or through direct evidence. You are implying that without direct evidence there can be no ""actual genocide."" That is not correct because there is no inherent difference in credibility or reliability between direct and indirect evidence. Indirect evidence requires a factfinder to make an inference, which is why the ""only reasonable inference"" analysis is so important. But there is no legal reason that a finding of *dolus specialis* cannot be made on the basis of indirect evidence.

"The short answer is ""Yes."" The more the senior official, the more likely they can be seen as speaking on behalf of the State.

Alternatively, it also depends on which Article II acts one alleged have happened. The closer the nexus between a statement to the act, the more probative and consequential the official's statements. So, for example, if a government minister, who isn't part of the war cabinet, makes genocidal statements (assume for the sake of this example that this was the intent) and is involved behind the scenes in blocking aid trucks from entering Gaza, then there could be a sufficiently close nexus between such a statement and acts that may be genocidal.

Other statements may still constitute incitement, but that falls under Article III. Failure to prevent or punish incitement incurs state responsibility.

"So I, a practicing lawyer, have read the Genocide Convention and I'm very confused by how intent can be proven by indirect evidence. For example, here are the five enumerated acts:

(a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

  
I would argue that either 1 or 2 occurs in almost any conflict zone. 

But of course, they must be committed ""with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.""

I'm not clear what **indirect** evidence could turn Acts 1 and 2 from acts of war to acts of genocide.

The IDF responds with evidence that their strike successfully eliminated \\[X\\]% of militants in that city. Would that be indirect evidence of genocide? Or direct evidence of war?

Further, any indirect evidence of genocidal intent must be gleaned from a pattern of conduct such that the only reasonable inference can be that the perpetrator intended to destroy in whole or in part such a group.

"Brother, I did read those cases and neither are specific enough to indicate that the ICJ employs any consistency across these questions. The Bosnia case points out that finding specific intent requires ""great care"" and then just reiterates the elements required for intent and then goes into the specifications for ""ethnic cleansing,"" which is a lesser charge. but a finding of ethnic cleansing can be dispositive on the question of genocide. So if indirect evidence is found for ethnic cleansing, would that suffice as indirect evidence for genocide? The only instruction provided is that great care must be taken. 

As a defense lawyer, if I were representing Israel, how would I prepare for the inevitable finding of indirect intent to commit acts of genocide? For example, above you've indicated that any statements by any member of the Israeli government, whether they are involved in prosecuting the war or not, could be indirect evidence of genocide. Perhaps it's not enough for genocide at the outset but is sufficient for a finding of intent to commit ethnic cleansing. That is now used as indirect evidence of intent to commit an act of genocide.

"My sense of this is that South Africa and its supporters will need to lean heavily on direct evidence through public statements by Israeli officials because Israel has a plausible, difficult to rebut, response to the indirect evidence in the context of war. Many wars which no one has considered calling a genocide have had [comparable](https://press.un.org/en/2022/sc14904.doc.htm) civilian to military death ratios (even accepting the [worst case](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6004/Contrary-to-Israeli-claims,-9-out-of-10-of-those-killed-in-Gaza-are-civilians%E2%80%8B) numbers at face value). 

Of course, the response to this will likely be that Israel has intentionally limited its genocidal acts to avoid public censure. The ICTY appellate division in the Krstic appeal made a similar observation:

> In determining that genocide occurred at Srebrenica, the cardinal question is whether the intent to commit genocide existed. While this intent must be supported by the factual matrix, the offence of genocide does not require proof that the perpetrator chose the most efficient method to accomplish his objective of destroying the targeted part. Even where the method selected will not implement the perpetrator’s intent to the fullest, leaving that destruction incomplete, this
ineffectiveness alone does not preclude a finding of genocidal intent. The international attention focused on Srebrenica, combined with the presence of the UN troops in the area, prevented those members of the VRS Main Staff who devised the genocidal plan from putting it into action in the most direct and efficient way. Constrained by the circumstances, they adopted the method which would allow them to implement the genocidal design while minimizing the risk of retribution.

But it would be a strange genocide indeed where the perpetrator intended the annihilation of substantial numbers of the protected group, risked international condemnation to kill them from the air, but then stopped short of killing them on the ground. Those levying the genocide accusation against Israel can’t have it both ways: Israel can’t be both so bloodthirsty that it is willing to ignore international censure to carry out a campaign of genocide before the watching eyes of the world, but so restrained that it has declined to carry out systematic killings within its effective zone of control.

Ultimately, I think there is a another reasonable inference to draw from this set of facts: Israeli leaders intended the destruction of Hamas (a political, unprotected group) and recklessly disregarded the impact on civilians.

"That's two questions, each of which must be addressed in turn.

>if the age 18 is CIL

What widespread and consistent State practice that occurs out of a sense of legal obligation shows that the age of majority is eighteen-- no more, no less? The CRC does not, because article 1 sets a maximum age of majority but permits States to set a lower age under national law. So it becomes a matter of analyzing State practice. There is no shortcut here. You have to look at as many States as possible, what they do, and why they do it.

>if they juridically treat someone under 18 as an adult and don't provide them with addequate protections

It depends. If a person is a child, then (all but a few) States owe them the obligations laid out in the CRC. You would need to show that some or all of those obligations are also customary. In that case, trying a child as an adult could violate those obligations, but it would not necessarily do so.",r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNNbG5mYXNyYjVxQ2lFa2lFbTRueV82OXphSGkzNFZTRGNLQkRFSnFNcjJoUXpickRnRElBY095WmFDLWNEMzJNM0llT1o1cDY1Y2tkdEM0Z3FTS3lYSGc9PQ==
"For a customary rule to exist, there must be more than consistent practice. There needs to be opinio juris which basically means that states are acting out of the belief that international law requires them to act in that specific way.

In the case of the age of majority, you have the first element but you do not have the second.

""Deciding genocide isn't an issue"" is not a ground for termination or suspension under the Genocide Convention or the VCLT.

That is not an obligation owed to non-States parties under the Genocide Convention. The Convention obligates States Parties to prevent and punish genocide.

>1. The rights and obligations on other members of the international community when two people claim to be the legitimate president of a state. 
- probably Venezuela around 2019 when Maduro and Guaidó were both claiming to be president and recognized by different groups.

>2. The implication of immunity for government official accused of grave violations of human rights. 
- probably related to Russian invasion of Ukraine and/or Palestinian situation since October 7 (and before tbh), around who can be held liable for human rights abuses and by whom. There's an open question on whether developments in international law affect state immunity.

"The questions before the Court are: 

>(a) What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures?

> (b) How do the policies and practices of Israel referred to in paragraph 18 (a) above affect the legal status of the occupation, and what are the legal consequences that arise for all States and the United Nations from this status?

The questions you have asked are not relevant to the questions before the Court and are unlikely to be addressed in the advisory opinion. They also suggest misconceptions about how international law works.

1) It isn't relevant. The occupied Palestinian Territory has been occupied since at least 1967, as affirmed in the Wall Advisory Opinion.

2) Suing a State requires the existence of an obligation, the breach of that obligation, and standing to bring a claim before a court with jurisdiction over a dispute. That is significantly more difficult than it sounds, particularly in the context of occupation. It also doesn't get into issues on the merits, like attribution of conduct to a State.

3) This doesn't make sense. ""People"" cannot sue a State for breaches of its public international law obligations, nor is it possible (or, even if it were possible, useful) to sue for recognition. And, as above, suing for ""damages"" isn't really how it works. Articulating a claim as a matter of public international law is much more complex than in domestic law.

4) That would be an act of aggression, plainly illegal, and a crime, though-- again as above-- prosecuting the claim would be extraordinarily difficult.

""Losing a war but declaring victory on the international stage"" has no legal relevance to anything. The language seems to imply that war is a valid foreign policy tool, and that the law should recognize winners and losers in a way that affects their rights and obligations. This is simply not how it works and there is not space here to explain why it is not correct.

5) Annexation would be an act of aggression and legally invalid. ""Forcing people to leave"" would also be illegal as a matter of State responsibility and personal criminal liability.

"As always, it depends. The ICTY explained that ""it is difficult to articulate with any degree of precision the threshold level of suffering at which other forms of mistreatment become torture. However, the existence of such a grey area should not be seen as an invitation to create an exhaustive list of acts constituting torture, in order to neatly categorise the prohibition."" Kunarac AJ, para. 149.

It is a fact-dependent analysis rather than a rigid, bright line rule, and *it is that way on purpose*. Once there are lists of criteria or conduct, it becomes possible to argue that anything not included on those lists is not included in the relevant prohibition.  

International law, and particularly international human rights law, tends not to have many bright line rules because they cause more problems than they solve.

">But laws are supposed to be clearly framed to avoid legal uncertainty and chilling effects right.

Almost all laws have chilling effects on conduct. That's what laws do. Laws are typically interpreted to avoid having *unwanted* chilling effects, but that is, again, a heavily fact-dependent analysis. Bright line rules arguably have a greater chilling effect than flexible rules do because they are unable to accommodate edge cases in the way that a more flexible rule is.

As for uncertainty, creating a list of factors or criteria doesn't necessarily create certainty. Is a list of five factors (or ten, or twenty, or any number) for what makes pain or suffering severe clearer than what a reasonable person understands severe to mean? That requires breaking one term into several terms, each of which must then be interpreted on its own and related to the others in terms of weight and correlation. I'm not at all sure that makes anything easier with regard to any given instance of conduct, particularly for non-lawyers.

>Wouldn't states themselves want more clear provisions ?

There is a difference between clarity and what you're talking about. But, for practical reasons, no, most States do not want black and white, exhaustive provisions.

"The answer depends very much on the importance of that soldier in the context of the war efforts of their country. There is no black and white answer in my opinion. Also, it would be extremely unlikely that a state would target the average soldier of another belligerant state that is taking holidays in a third state.

"I don't know what you mean by ""protection under international law,"" so it's impossible to answer an ambiguous question precisely. ""Protection"" *from what*, exactly?

*Preface: I am not going to give you the definitions of the specific terms and phrases, you will have to do the work and look it up for yourself, because I'm only interested in addressing the specific issue of territorial scope.*

As a general rule, there are some **geographical limits** to applying IHL, and the specific reaches of IHL differ between international and non-international armed conflicts (IACs and NIACs). One must also keep in mind the **law of neutrality**, an entirely distinct area of international law that is nevertheless closely related to IHL, especially when defining the latter's geographical scope. However, such a general rule must also be reconciled with the principle of effectiveness, which when applied in armed conflicts means that IHL applies whenever and wherever an act of belligerency, crossing the threshold, occurs.

In IAC, the principle of unity of territory applies IHL to all territories under the belligerent parties' control. The same rule also applies to co-belligerents. This principle was stated by the ICTY in *Tadić* (Decision on Defence Motion for Interlocutory Appeal on Jurisdiction) IT-94-1-AR72 (2 October 1995), ¶68:

>at least some of the provisions of the Conventions apply to the entire territory of the Parties to conflict, not just to the actual vicinity of the hostilities. Certainly, some of the provisions are clearly bound up with the hostilities and the geographical scope of those provisions should be so limited. Others, particularly those relating to the prisoners of war and civilians, are not so limited.

Robert Kolb and Richard Hyde also pointed out in their book on the law of armed conflicts that, IHL also applies in areas with ""actual hostilities or \\[to\\] relationships between belligerents outside the territory of the belligerents.""

In other words, the territorial applicability of IHL depends on the contents of the specific provisions invoked. Hence, **my question, again,** is **protection** ***from what***?

In NIACs, the issue is a bit more complex. The general rule of territorial unity also applies. According to *Akayesu* (Judgment) ICTR 96-4-T (2 September 1998), ¶ 635, AP II applies

>irrespective of the exact location of the affected person in the territory of the State engaged in the conflict.

Similarly, Common Article 3 ""must be applied in the whole territory of the State engaged in the conflict."" *Akayesu* cites *Tadic* as an authority, so a reasonable reading of the *dictum* suggests that IHL applies only to territory under the belligerent parties' control.

Now, the question is **can IHL apply** ***extra-territorially*** **in NIACs?** That will depend in large part on the specific identities of the person in question because, as a general rule IHL as applicable in NIACs applies to persons and objects rather than places: see e.g. APII, article 2(1), *Kayishema and Ruzindana* (Judgment) ICTR-95-1-T (21 May 1999) ¶ 176. On leaders of non-state armed groups, the general consensus is that they are ""lawful targets due to their involvement in the hostilities,"" but other restrictions on IHL, such as the principle of proportionality, etc., remain applicable: Sandesh Sivakumaran, *The Law of Non-International Armed Conflict* (OUP 2012), p 251.

On the law of neutrality, without going too much into the weeds, IHL does not apply to neutral states that are not involved in IACs, and the same overwhelmingly applies to territories not involved in NIACs. If it does, then wherever and whenever an armed conflict begins, it creates a global battlefield simply by a combatant travelling out of the belligerent parties' territories and nothing more. Such an application of IHL is clearly absurd. The law of neutrality limits the geographical reach of IHL. Still, it is also contingent on states seeking to maintain a neutral status to take steps to do so, such as repelling the entry of belligerents.

TLDR: The answer is not straightforward.",r/internationallaw,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNaNW5lcm9KMEJLNC00bG0yeTZBazVUU1Fka3NKclJ2dTE4MVU5SlVYT2FCY1J1OEotWERkNVBtQmcyTGFMRmQxemkxaVpnSmt6eXZsckUwQ0tfTW5JeGxJSE9rSW9sYVFjQ2hUQVk4blcxb0E9
"There isn't a specific source because it's an application of international humanitarian law. There is nothing that specifically says that a combatant's location does not afford them special protections, but if an attack doesn't violate IHL, then it is lawful.
