And the fact that they made it so only jews have a right to self determination

https://www.timesofisrael.com/final-text-of-jewish-nation-state-bill-set-to-become-law/ 

Not all of the unequal laws only hurt Palestinians. That's the thing about racism it hurts everyone including the Israeli who are forced to serve in a genocidal war and ordered to conduct collective punishment on civilians.

""Unlike the beginning of the war, now about half of the Jewish public (51% compared to 37% in November) believes that the IDF uses firepower appropriately against Gaza, compared to 43% (58% in November) who believe that there is use of TOO LITTLE FIREPOWER. An absolute majority (88%) also justifies the scope of casualties on the Palestinian side when considering the goals of the war.""

43% think they haven't got far enough and 51% thinks they have gone the correct amount which means, ONLY 6% are undecided or think they have gone too far.  And while 88% think the war goals justify the civilian casualties a majority don't even believe the government has war goals. ""the majority (53%) of respondents still think that the government has no clear goals in the war.""

You do realize that the Israeli government and population have made it very clear they don't want more Palestinian citizens right?  That was a major sticking point of the 2000 Camp David Accords. Israel rejected a reduced right of return for Palestinians outright. Most Israeli politicians say adding Palestinians to the country as equal citizens would destroy Israel. 

Israel wants to be Democratic, Jewish, and control the Palestinian Territories. It can only pick two. Annexing the territories and their populations makes Israel majority Arab, which means the Jewish nature of the state is lost if they remain democratic. If they refuse to give Palestinians voting rights, they aren't democratic but they keep the Jewish state. Or they can remain Jewish and Democratic and leave the Occupied terrorities. The Israeli state has been stuck in desicion pararalysis over this paradox for over 50 years.

"Answer 1
This unsubstantiated claim by Israel, that Hamas uses civilians as human shields, has never been verified by any independent investigation. This claim consistently serves as cover, a deflection tactic, and an unbridled excuse used by Israel to indiscriminately and disproportionately target and kill Palestinian civilians.

Answer 2
Amnesty International (AI) has conducted several investigations into Israeli claims that Hamas uses civilians ‚Äúto shield military objectives from attacks.‚Äù In investigations following Israeli military attacks on Gaza in 2009 and 2014, AI found no evidence to back this claim, which Israel uses to indiscriminately and disproportionately target Palestinian civilians and civilian infrastructure.

Answer 3
There are hundreds of documented cases of Palestinians being used as human shields by the Israeli army. In fact, using Palestinians as human shields was so common that when the Israeli high court outlawed the practice in 2005, the Israeli army appealed to the court to have its decision reversed.

Answer 4
Israeli human rights group B‚ÄôTselem continues to document the Israeli army‚Äôs use of Palestinian civilians as human shields despite Israel‚Äôs high court‚Äôs ruling making this practice illegal in 2005. These incidents include Israeli armed forces using Palestinian civilians to check houses for booby traps or handle suspicious objects, in addition to tying Palestinians to Israeli military vehicles to deter Palestinians from throwing stones at these vehicles.

Answer 5
Rule 1 of the Principle of Distinction between Civilians and Combatants states: ‚ÄúThe parties to the conflict must always distinguish between civilians and combatants. Attacks are only permissible against combatants and must not target civilians.‚Äù

Answer 6
‚ÄúCivilians must be protected. They cannot legally be targets of violence, or disproportionately harmed by it. And those obligations apply to all parties involved in the fighting, even if the other side has violated them. ‚ÄòHuman shields‚Äô are still protected civilians.‚Äù New York Times, Oct 19, 2023)",r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNZU3Vhc2hmOS1QSzJPU1pQVTE2dUpaSG1uMXpEUHo5QWNfVnhWZmhBbVo5X0ZCX3Nvd2x5MUcxUEdRTmxtTnRQcy1QMUFBb0lEWHQyUmMyQzFkd0hLMWc9PQ==

"Answer 1
Despite this claim being promoted by Israel and parroted by the mainstream media, there is no proof of its veracity. In fact, every piece of evidence for this claim provided by Israel has been debunked or looked upon skeptically by serious journalists as well as international organizations.

Answer 2
In the absence of evidence for the use of hospitals as Hamas command centers, Israel‚Äôs systematic targeting of healthcare facilities in Gaza constitute war crimes.

Answer 3
On October 27, IOF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari, citing ‚Äúconcrete evidence‚Äù, claimed that Hamas was using five hospitals in the Gaza Strip as command centers and were adjacent to tunnels.

Not all of the unequal laws only hurt Palestinians. That's the thing about racism it hurts everyone including the Israeli who are forced to serve in a genocidal war and ordered to conduct collective punishment on civilians.

""Unlike the beginning of the war, now about half of the Jewish public (51% compared to 37% in November) believes that the IDF uses firepower appropriately against Gaza, compared to 43% (58% in November) who believe that there is use of TOO LITTLE FIREPOWER. An absolute majority (88%) also justifies the scope of casualties on the Palestinian side when considering the goals of the war.""

43% think they haven't got far enough and 51% thinks they have gone the correct amount which means, ONLY 6% are undecided or think they have gone too far.  And while 88% think the war goals justify the civilian casualties a majority don't even believe the government has war goals. ""the majority (53%) of respondents still think that the government has no clear goals in the war.""

You do realize that the Israeli government and population have made it very clear they don't want more Palestinian citizens right?  That was a major sticking point of the 2000 Camp David Accords. Israel rejected a reduced right of return for Palestinians outright. Most Israeli politicians say adding Palestinians to the country as equal citizens would destroy Israel. 

Israel wants to be Democratic, Jewish, and control the Palestinian Territories. It can only pick two. Annexing the territories and their populations makes Israel majority Arab, which means the Jewish nature of the state is lost if they remain democratic. If they refuse to give Palestinians voting rights, they aren't democratic but they keep the Jewish state. Or they can remain Jewish and Democratic and leave the Occupied terrorities. The Israeli state has been stuck in desicion pararalysis over this paradox for over 50 years.

"As far as I can tell, the objective was never to get the hostages back.  They were part of a larger Hannibal type directive.  Israel has leveled more than 70% of the buildings in Gaza, including all hospitals, schools, mosques, and churches.  Combine this with the lack of food, drinking water, medical supplies, and any other necessities of life, and the likelihood that many of the hostages are dead skyrockets. The IDF has it self shot multiple hostages, some waving white flags speaking Hebrew and some during the rescue operation where they posed as aid workers.  250 aid workers have already been targeted and killed by the IDF as well as over 100 journalists both inside and outside of Gaza. 

Saving the hostages was never the objective, it has always been about revenge.  That's why the families of the hostages are protesting in Israel.

"I keep hearing how Israel is conducting genocide against the Palestinians.  One of Israel‚Äôs characteristics is that militarily, they are very good at accomplishing their objectives.  They defeated the Arabs multiple times even though they were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. They took out the Iraqi nuclear reactor and have killed multiple terrorist leaders in pinpoint strikes.  They have a long history of doing the impossible. 

However, for some reason they have been completely incompetent at genocide.   When Israel was founded in 1947-48 there were about 700,000 Palestinians, today that number is around 7,000,000!  Now call me crazy but how a country known for its military capabilities can be this incompetent is beyond me.   Unless of course, they are not trying to carry out genocide after all.  

Hamas is doing what some Japanese troops did on Okinawa.  Rather than allow civilians to flee, they pulled them into the caves.  When US forces were forced to use explosives and flamethrowers to kill the Japanese troops they also found dead women and children.    Hamas uses hospitals, schools and mosque to serve as weapons caches, rocket firing platforms and fighting positions.  

If Hamas cared for the people of Gaza, they would not have spent millions on building tunnels and rockets.  They would not have trained to kill Israelis and would be working to make peace.  Egypt, Jordan and others who fought have made peace.  There are no rocket attacks from those places and no Israeli bombs falling on their cities.  Hamas knows that civilian deaths help their cause as it has done throughout the conflict.  They know useful Idiots will march and protest calling on Israel to stop.   Well it looks like this time, Hamas jumped the shark and Israel has decided it‚Äôs better to rip the band aid off, bleed and cauterize the would that continue to suffer a thousand small cuts.

"Answer 1: The claim that Hamas uses civilians as human shields is supported by multiple sources, including testimonies and reports from conflict zones. Independent investigations in conflict zones are challenging, and the lack of verification does not disprove the claim. The complexity of urban warfare often makes it difficult to gather concrete evidence.

Answer 2: While Amnesty International did not find conclusive evidence in their specific investigations, this does not fully negate the possibility of such practices. Conflicts in densely populated areas create situations where militants operate within civilian zones, complicating independent assessments.

Answer 3: The documented use of Palestinians as human shields by the Israeli army is condemned and has been ruled illegal by Israel‚Äôs high court. However, acknowledging this practice does not absolve Hamas of similar accusations. Both parties must adhere to international laws.

Answer 4: The continuous documentation by B‚ÄôTselem of the Israeli military‚Äôs use of human shields is critical and highlights serious violations. However, this does not mean Hamas does not engage in similar practices. Each party must be scrutinized and held accountable independently.

Answer 5: The Principle of Distinction between Civilians and Combatants is fundamental in international humanitarian law. Both sides must distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel‚Äôs actions are often a response to threats embedded within civilian areas, complicating the distinction.

Answer 6: International law protects civilians, even those allegedly used as human shields. Both parties in the conflict have obligations to minimize civilian harm. Violations by one side do not justify similar actions by the other, but the operational realities of urban conflict often make these protections challenging to uphold fully.

"The claim that Hamas uses civilians as human shields has been documented by several human rights organizations during the 2023-24 Gaza conflict.

Human rights watch In their latest reports, HRW has highlighted instances where Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have positioned military assets in densely populated civilian areas. This practice increases the risk to civilians 

 
The UN has noted that both parties in the conflict must adhere to international humanitarian laws, but has documented Hamas‚Äôs use of civilian areas for launching attacks, effectively using civilians as human shields.

"The 186,000 number was made by a UK medical journal that included deaths by disease, starvation, and infection.

Hamas wanted a prisoner exchange and immediately wanted to give the hostages back to Israel in exchange for some of the thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli military prisons without trial, but Israel refused and started indiscriminately dropping bombs instead. 

Dismantling Israel, an apartheid state, doesn‚Äôt mean killing all Jews. Palestine was a multi ethnic and religious area before the establishment of Israel which created a segregation system based on religion with the help of the British for colonial and antisemitic motives (meaning, Lord Balfour didn‚Äôt want Jews living in Europe so he supported Israel as a state where the British can rule via the Jewish people they ‚Äúpromised‚Äù the land to). Jewish people deserve safety and protection but indiscriminately killing civilians in the name of Judaism isn‚Äôt going to achieve that.

"Info for you how the peace talks are going thus far
Timeline: How Netanyahu thwarted every prisoner exchange deal

Quds News Network ‚Ä¢ Friday, July 12, 2024 

> Anyone following the news of the prisoner exchange deal talks can see that it has become clear that Israel‚Äôs Benjamin Netanyahu has been repeatedly thwarting efforts to secure prisoner exchange deals with the resistance. Despite various attempts to facilitate these exchanges and several approvals by the resistance movements led by Hamas, Netanyahu‚Äôs actions have consistently led to delays and complications.

The following timeline provides a look at how Netanyahu‚Äôs decisions and strategic leaks have derailed progress on multiple occasions, raising questions about the underlying personal motives, which have turned the lives of the Palestinian people and Israeli prisoners alike into a political game.

January 17, 2024: Netanyahu cancels the outcomes of the preparatory meetings for the first Paris meeting without coordinating with the Israeli War Council or the Israeli negotiating team, and tightens Israel‚Äôs stance.

January 24, 2024: Netanyahu delays granting authorization to the Israeli negotiating team and postpones the first Paris meeting.

The Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed Al-Ansari, publicly criticized him for the first time in a tweet.
‚ÄúIf the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúInstead of concerning himself with Qatar‚Äôs strategic relations with the United States, we hope Netanyahu decides to operate in good faith and concentrate on the release of the hostages.‚Äù

January 28-31, 2024: During the first Paris meeting, progress was made. However, upon his return to Israel, the head of Mossad was surprised by Netanyahu‚Äôs publication of five statements that widened the gaps, revealing confidential information during the negotiations.

February 6, 2024: Amidst efforts to reach a humanitarian truce before the month of Ramadan, Hamas announced it had responded positively to mediator initiatives. However, Netanyahu quickly leaked statements to Channel 13 under the name ‚Äúa senior Israeli political official‚Äù declaring that Hamas‚Äôs stance meant rejecting the deal.

February 13, 2024: At the Cairo meeting, Netanyahu delayed sending a delegation. When he did, he sent them without authorization and accompanied by his personal advisor to restrict the head of Mossad. He then refrained from sending a delegation to continue the talks despite the negotiating team‚Äôs support.

February 23, 2024: At the second Paris meeting, Netanyahu called the head of Mossad on his way to Paris to inform him of reducing his authorized powers, despite it being approved by the War Council.

March 16, 2024: Netanyahu refused to hold a War Council meeting to discuss the negotiating team‚Äôs authorization on the eve of proposed talks in Doha. A military representative on the negotiating team leaked to the media his frustration with Netanyahu‚Äôs actions.

April 8, 2024: Renewed negotiations aimed at a ‚Äúphased deal‚Äù to release 33 Israeli prisoners. The Israeli army announced its withdrawal from Khan Yunis. However, after threats from Israel‚Äôs finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu announced a military operation in Rafah, causing the negotiations to collapse.

April 25, 2024: Netanyahu leaked confidential information from the negotiations to Smotrich, who then leaked it to the media, causing the negotiations to collapse again.

April 26, 2024: Netanyahu contacted the Israeli negotiating team without the knowledge of the War Council to reduce their authorized powers.

May 4, 2024: Netanyahu preempted a response expected by mediators to Hamas on an Israeli exchange proposal by issuing a statement rejecting ending the war in any way.

May 6, 2024: Hamas officially accepted the Israeli proposal presented to them. However, Netanyahu hastened to reject Hamas‚Äôs response before any security consultations or high-level meetings.

June 3, 2024: After US President Biden announced his plan for a prisoner exchange deal and ending the war on June 1, Netanyahu leaked his opposition to Biden‚Äôs plan during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee in the Knesset.

June 23, 2024: Netanyahu announced in an interview with Channel 14 that he is only interested in a partial deal, which allows him to resume the war.

July 12, 2024: Israeli media reported that Netanyahu has introduced additional obstacles in the ceasefire negotiations.

They cited senior Israeli officials as stating that Netanyahu is currently controlling all the details and has decided to harden his stance on the negotiations.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is almost single-handedly managing the negotiations‚Äù, they stated.",r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNabEZEM2YtSVhFYW9JNk8tSGM4TzFEY1VtcWxrS04yNm1RSXZvdHJrUHZNV3FWbVNXZzhpdEpDb0NrRTNwWEsxLVpkUmxOOVU2bkZab2w4bFh1S1ZNU0E9PQ==

"Honestly, you are just embarrassing yourself at this point. We can all see in real time what is happening and your pathetic, desperate attempts to justify why Israel has to kill so many innocent civilians just doesn‚Äôt cut the mustard. Your Hasbara has so many holes in it that you just look even worse trying to explain why its ok for Israel to keep killing. 

Israel deliberately targets civilians. Ive included links for you 

ü§• Israel does not target civilians.
Answer 1
On December 16, 2023, Al-Jazeera Journalist Anas Al Sharif reported from Gaza‚Äôs Kamal Adwan Hospital, witnessing displaced Palestinians being buried alive as Israeli bulldozers crushed their tents. Despite this, Israel claims not to target civilians. Ironically, Anas, whose family home was bombed, had received threats from the Israeli military, with his father killed in an airstrike just five days prior.

Answer 2
On December 15, 2023, Israel shot dead its own hostages in Gaza. They were unarmed, shirtless young men who waved a makeshift white flag and pleaded for their lives in Hebrew. If this incident does not prove what Palestinians have decried for decades ‚Äì that the IOF habitually engages in indiscriminate slaughter ‚Äì then we‚Äôre not sure what more proof you require.

Answer 3
All evidence from over six months of Israeli aggression in Gaza suggests that Israel deliberately targets civilian areas and specific civilians (i.e. journalists, doctors, writers etc). This is backed up by a decades-long track record of disproportionate casualties among civilians at the hands of the Israeli military.

Answer 4
When the current war broke out in October of 2023, the IOF Spokesperson was quick to make clear that ‚Äúthe emphasis is on damage, not precision.‚Äù These statements clearly align with Israel‚Äôs actions since then: hundreds of tons of bombs have been dropped on the Gaza Strip so far, leading to a horrifying death amongst Palestinians (the majority of whom are women and children) in the Gaza Strip.

Answer 5
Despite its propaganda to the contrary, indiscriminate targeting has always been the ‚ÄúIsraeli way of war‚Äù. This time, however, Israel has a particular objective to make the Gaza Strip unfit for human habitation in the hope that it will facilitate Israeli plans for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza‚Äôs Palestinians. Even though they employ euphemisms such as ‚Äúhumanitarian migration‚Äù to obfuscate their intentions, Israeli officials have repeatedly made clear their goal to destroy Gaza to such a degree as to leave its inhabitants with no choice but to leave.

Answer 6
If Israel is not purposefully targeting civilians and the vast civilian casualties are all accidents then the Israeli military ‚Äì the biggest beneficiary of U.S. support ‚Äì is surely one of the most hopelessly inadequate and unprofessional armies in the world and should not be receiving aid from the U.S.

I am sure there are insurgencies against Hamas, but sadly they dont appear to have been successful in ousting them or help stop what happened before it did.

It would be ideal if the problem had resolved itself and there could be actual talks between palestinians and israel on implementing a solution.

"Bad image

your telling me that without artillery, or chemical or biological weaponry, europeans and their decedents killed more people then 5 first world wars back to back? remember the first 200 years of the fighting the Europeans were using shot and pike tactics like the 30s years war, and matchlock muskets were heavily used, and germ theory wouldnt see evidence until the 1800s 

bear in mind the global population estimate in 1600 was 500 million and 1 billion in 1900. That means that roughly between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people were somehow native american and killed by europeans in that time. 

and they got to a population that big while still being a bronze age society, except they didnt use bronze all that much and preferred copper or glass in most cultures. And this is all being painted as if it was just happening in america and not both north and south American continents done by multiple groups to multiple cultures

"No. You are incorrect. Here is a very similar situation where the US/ NATO intervened.

Examining America and the world‚Äôs reaction to the KLF fighters-Albanians and subsequent action to stop Serbians displacing and bombing Albanians as compared to our reaction to Israel /Hamas shows a clear bias.

In the beginning, KLF killed a similar number of Serbians as Hamas did. Serbians began ethnic cleansing and mass displacement which is an international war crime. America and NATO came in and bombed Serbia to stop them. You can debate whether that was the right thing to do but that is what America did.

And Serbia killed MUCH fewer Albanians than Israel has killed in Gaza in such a short time. The targeting of Gaza university professors, poets, and journalists, destroying hospitals, bombing refugee camps and schools is unprecedented. History will look at Israel and their supporters with disdain.

Hamas is doing the exact same thing Netanjahu is. Both are doing their best to sow strive among people who should really be friends.

It serves both Hamas and Netanjahu to keep the war going. Maybe a global anti terror coalition without israel could solve the issue, but i dont see which nations would be willing to sacrifice their own soldiers to defend another nations citiziens from their own terrorists.

Yes it was a coordinated military assault which Israel knew was coming. I disagree that hamas wants it to go on, I think they wanted to make a point and get back some of the 10,000s of Palestinian prisoners Israel tortures.

And to your previous point, how would I feel if someone broke into my house and attacked my family? I'd probably do what hamas has done.

"When is the last time u research the situation in palestine?

First:
Palestine consist of 3 territories, the west bank, golan heights and gaza. All 3 territories are under israel occupation.

This means:

   ‚óèThe west bank and golan heights:

 Nothing can be built, repair, import/export nothing without israel authorization. Palestinians live under countless military rules that keeps their living situation rudimentary, after all even the palestinian flag is ban. Add to that israel continuously demolishes school or other structures even tho this is a violation of the geneva convention, therefore war crimes:

 Article 53 
- Prohibited destruction
Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.

   ‚óèGaza:

Gaza is surrounded by a wall, fence. Israel controls borders import/export and rafah border import since 2005. Israel also has control of sea, land airspace since 1967.
In 2000 israel imposed a blockade of palestinian territories and never lifted gaza blockade, in 2007 it officially became permanent. Israel also control water and electicity even tho the PA pay for it.
Nothing comes in or out of gaza without israel approval for the last 24 years to the point NGOs nicknamed gaza an open air prison:

Second:

Free Heathcare in all 3 territories is provided by NGOs like UNRWA, MSF, Doctors of the world... all cost from buildings to supplies are provided by the UN, international donors funds NGOs such as the World Bank Emergency Services Support Program, the European Union (EU), United Nations agencies, NGO's, and the Islamic Bank for Development.

Since 1948 most palestinian are registered refugees, since 1969 all palestinians are considered a protected population under the geneva convention of occupied territories.

And even tho under geneva convention israel as an occupying power is responsible for the palestinians well-being, all they been doing is the opposite of well-being.
Collective punishment are also war crimes.

"According to who, bc so far israel can't prove its claims:

""Prior to their capture of Dar al-Shifa hospital, the¬†Israel¬†Defense Forces went to great lengths to depict the medical complex as a headquarters for Hamas, from where its attacks on Israel were planned.

The evidence produced so far falls well short of that. IDF videos have shown only modest collections of small arms, mostly assault rifles, recovered from the extensive medical complex.

That suggests an armed presence, but not the sort of elaborate nerve centre depicted in animated graphics presented to the media before al-Shifa was seized, portraying a network of well-equipped subterranean chambers.

Even the videos produced so far have raised questions under scrutiny. A BBC analysis found the footage of an IDF spokesperson showing the apparent discovery of a bag containing a gun behind an MRI scanning machine, had been taped hours before the arrival of the journalists to whom he was supposedly showing it.

In a video shown later, the number of guns in the bag had doubled. The IDF claimed its video of what it found at the hospital was unedited, filmed in a single take, but the BBC analysis found it had been edited.

Israeli forces say they are still carefully exploring the site. The video presentation of al-Shifa did show the main facilities lay deep underground, and it is quite possible the Israeli soldiers have not reached them yet, so there could be much more to come. But the attempt to present what has been found so far as significant is bound to fuel scepticism about whatever is presented later.

There are questions over how much of its graphic presentation of the¬†network under al-Shifa¬†was based on what Israel knew already; its own architect had built an extensive basement area there the last time Israel directly occupied Gaza, up to 2005.

All of this is significant under the Geneva conventions,¬†which forbid military operations against hospitals¬†unless ‚Äúthey are used to commit, outside their humanitarian duties, acts harmful to the enemy‚Äù. This exception, spelled out in article 19 of the fourth Geneva convention, states specifically: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the presence of small arms and ammunition taken from such combatants and not yet handed to the proper service, shall not be considered to be acts harmful to the enemy‚Äù.

Israel ratified the Geneva conventions in 1951 and claims to observe the principle of proportionality under international humanitarian law, in which the direct military advantage anticipated from a military operation outweighs the civilian harm that can reasonably be anticipated as a consequence. Its observance of those principles is what is in question....""

In a statement,¬†the Israeli military said¬†one of the people belonged to Hamas and was planning an imminent attack ""inspired by the events of October 7.""

The head of surgery at Ibn Sina Hospital, Dr. Tawfiq al-Shawbaky, told NPR that the man was a patient, paralyzed and using a wheelchair.

The hospital said that its CCTV footage showed armed Israeli gunmen dressed as hospital staff and Arab civilians, which the Israeli military confirmed to NPR.

""They raided one of the floors in the hospital and attacked the hospital staff,"" al-Shawbaky said. ""They raided one of the patients' rooms and killed him, and the people who were in the room with him, his brother and friend.""

The United Nations has reported a rise in Israeli raids in the West Bank since Oct. 7, and¬†expressed concern at the escalation. The U.N. says that over 360 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since Oct. 7, and that six Israelis have also been killed.""

"Lol, i guess u never heard of the hannibal directive, how they butcher their response and killed their own citizens on oct 7th:

UN investigation report of oct 7th:

F. Israeli response

The Commission found that ISF‚Äôs response to the attack was initially significantly delayed and, in many places, totally inadequate. Small teams of ISF ground forces appeared in several locations during the morning but they were slow to arrive, insufficient in numbers and lacked coordination with a centralized command and with each other. 

Several ISF tanks were active that day, at border locations and in the civilian villages, including one that provided protective cover for civilians in hiding and several ISF members defending a position at the Nova festival site. In many kibbutzim, local rapid deployment security teams fought against the attackers with very little or no external reinforcement.

The Commission is aware of allegations that ISF used the ‚ÄúHannibal Directive‚Äù to prevent the capture of Israeli civilians and their transfer to Gaza, even at the cost of killing them. Such allegations were made in relation to ISF actions in the Nova site, including reports of ISF attack helicopters shooting at Israeli civilian cars, resulting in the killing of Israelis. 

The Commission confirmed the presence of at least eight attack helicopters in various locations on 7 October, but it could not confirm that they shot at civilians or civilian cars, including in the area of the festival. The Commission documented one statement by an ISF tank crew, confirming that the crew had applied the Hannibal Directive by shooting at a vehicle which they suspected was transporting abducted ISF soldiers.

The Commission also verified information indicating that, in at least two other cases, ISF had likely applied the Hannibal Directive, resulting in the killing of up to 14 Israeli civilians. One woman was killed by ISF helicopter fire while being abducted from Nir Oz to Gaza by militants. In another case the Commission found that Israeli tank fire killed some or all of the 13 civilian hostages held in a house in Be‚Äôeri.

The Commission found that Israeli authorities prioritised identifying victims, notifying families and allowing for burial rather than forensic investigation, leading to evidence of crimes, especially sexual crimes, not being collected and preserved. The Commission also notes the loss of potential evidence due to inadequately trained first responders.

Buddy, you're talking about thousands of years ago. Who do you think Palestinians are? They are descendants of those Jewish people, who converted to Christianity and then to Islam. Even if they were different people, it doesn't matter. Motherfuckers have been living there for hundreds and hundreds of years. You can't come in and kick them out

>which i think is understandable given their terrible experience with sharing a country with others in europe during ww2

No. Completely irrelevant. You can't make Palestinians pay for the Europeans' sins of ww2.

Peaceful solution would've been possible if they didn't want to create an ethnostate. You can't create an ethnostate without genocide or ethnic cleansing.

Unfortunately, they don't get to have a say, just like how Palestinians didn't get a say in the 40s.

Hamas is a reaction to Israeli oppression. Hamas is an idea. You can't kill an idea by murdering people who believe it. Because it will just produce more people who believe it.

"Exactly, the fact that they are ultimately quite similar people due to shared heritage is the justification for why its not exactly the same as kicking them out. You can say its flawed reasoning and in essence it is but a freaking world war just ended and people were tired of fighting and the jews deserved a shot at a peaceful life on their own terms after all that.

If the war  (ww2)hadnt happened and the wish would have still been the same i could see how some nation wouldve just bought the land prior, but given the administration was already a sort of power relation over the area just like a landlord can decide which tennant he wants to live in his house,  they didnt have the resources or will to redistribute the land in a more coordinated and fair way which in retrospect was a big mistake but we need to adapt to it now. Just like colonial subjects these administrations have not exactly been treated as equals back then, those were crueler times and i am glad we changed since then.

An ethnostate could have also been established on peaceful terms, secession is a thing and can be handled via treaties.

Depriving the israelis of their say is just as bad and not a real solution to the problem just a recipe for more violence.

Its their desire to prove their (religions) superiority that fuels them, calling themselves fighters against oppression is just a cheap veil to hide their radicalism from the populace.

"I agree that its pretty immoral. But almost everything we used to do at some point is now considered immoral, you cant judge the past by todays standards. We can only learn from mistakes and try to do better. You cannot fix what has happened unless you have a time machine.

Then we will have to agree to disagree on what is possible peacefully.

I have to admit that i am not an expert in islam studies to fully grasp all the details, but to me Hamas'es proclamations speak for themselves and dont require israeli propaganda to be badly received by most of everyone else. They dont exactly talk of peaceful coexistence and reconciliation with the jews to build a prosperous future on their shared heritage.",r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnMF9PWlh2VWduSi1DYklxTWZPT2RDSC03UzVMWFpoNDRJNmNsdEF0V2E2S29uZnF2MXBIYU1UV053NkdBSmZEeExiNkxESFU1WHFZOE8tMTZQVTNJTWc9PQ==
"What fucking proclamation? 

>They dont exactly talk of peaceful coexistence and reconciliation with the jews

This is completely untrue though. They literally do. They revised their charter in 2017 to clarify that their fight is against Israel and Israel only, not against Jewish people.",r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnQ3UwUU5TLVI2ZUVYdDZhelpqSjhWdTZMeV9ORHNKVEttcXZqTDRVYUNaU2VZTDBsLXAza241VmhORERRUVpoRXl4WUVjeUJkYjluVGczWFM3VHdJOEE9PQ==

"Exactly.  Hamas is like a bogeyman kind of word at this point.  All rational thinking of how to deal with them is thrown out the window. This is what israel wants. To just say ""hamas"" and expect no further questions. 

And then they completely dodge their reason for existing + ignore their statements +  expect israel to be the sole spokeman of hamas.

Like really? Is this how you expect your courts to work as well? Allow only for prosecution without any defense?

Why do we trust an entity like israel so blindly, especially given the fact that objectively they are the starter of the whole conflict. You can't just take over a region and kick out people out of their homes without consequences, but israel constantly acts like they never did anything wrong.",r/internationalpolitics,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNnUUpxenlDTVVFSUFFalNXZUktU1NmMXNITDFhVjgzVUNSb3VfV0V6ZURPR3lxdkE2ZFBiV2tQLWVuNW9BQXpyMnl4QTVkSjMxdFRfa1RLd0J1WnRXU3c9PQ==
"They never retracted their founding document, which essentially declares jews as the source of all evil, having to be eradicated from arab palestine.

 Making it quite clear that those are still their desired goals and the facts on the ground (lack of own power and support by the former arab league) just forced them to put those off ""for now"" and strike a more concilliatory tone until they can take control in a state they can control due to forming a majority.
