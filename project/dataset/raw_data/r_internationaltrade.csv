"There is no **preferential duty treatment** when it comes to China. The only time you would need a Certificate of Origin from the exporter is to present it to CBP against a claim for preferential duty treatment-- not applicable for China really given that there is not a FTA in place.

**Marking requirements**. Again, claiming China is not a benefit. They will have to adhere to marking requirements regardless of what it is. This does not present a reason to need the original Country of Origin certificate from the exporter. 

**Duties.** The US Customs Agent should not need it for non-preferential treatment entries. If it is a ongoing issue, then you will need to onboard the risk of clearance yourself and get a repayment agreement in place/LoC/CAI
