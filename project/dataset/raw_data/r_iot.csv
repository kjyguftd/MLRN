"1nce is a spin-off from Deutsche Telekom…. They want to change the IOT market but their service offering only allows certain specific use cases in cellular connectivity with very low data consumption (LPWA) and therefore their offering cannot respond to the large majority of cellular IOT projects requiring greater data consumption.
They are dependent on roaming agreements from DT, or T-Mobile for the USA.

In addition, for a large-scale deployment, the basic investment for a company... example: if you want to deploy 1000 devices... you will have to pay a basic cost of €10,000 (not counting fixed costs... delivery costs... cost of the SIM... )

With this business model… the service is “low touch”…. Customer service ? Features of their management platform and services included?…)

"Thank You!

1) It wont be used much, looking for at least 1-2 weeks battery lasting

2) rarely... very rarely.... maybe once in 2 weeks if that

3) not worried about that, as long as the data is SENT within 1-2 seconds of when the button is pressed.  but >5 seconds would be nice

4) I would expect them to press it again.  So it could have a green light to show its on, then when it is pressed if GPS was sent successfully it would maybe show them a flashing green light for a minute or so and if not a red light, this will require them to press it again, something like this.

5) No, it will be used mostly indoors and sometimes outdoors.

6) Urban

7) It can flash red light showing failure....

8) **DGPS**: 1 to 3 meters would be nice, or **WAAS/EGNOS/LAAS**: 1 to 3 meters, but would be happy with **Consumer-Grade GPS**: 5 to 10 meters

"If you don't care about power consumption, you can have the device check it's location frequently and keep your cellular modem in a fully connected state. As soon as someone presses the button, you send a message to your server.

Of course people generally *do* care about power consumption, so you can go to the other extreme. Put the cellular modem into PSM mode and put your MCU into a low power state with an interrupt connected to your push-button. Once the button is pressed you wake up and attempt to get a fix. I'm not a GPS expert, but I believe that this can take significantly longer than a few seconds. Stuff that I'm seeing online is saying 3 minutes. Once you have the fix, you send your message to the server, get an ACK and then shutdown into your sleep state.

It may also be worth considering whether you could use non-GPS methods for determining the location. You could (for example) do a Wi-Fi scan and submit your results to a third party service that uses a database of WiFi SSIDs to estimate the location of the device.",r/iot,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYNzZjaGN4WWwzSzhXckg5SXdrWmFjcWlYVW52QUYwUE9xQlY3b0FtV1FSci1JbnFkT0JJcl9BcUNnc1A1NnlzZDU5ZWtfMWpWMDJsNTQ3RjdxbXlTSnc9PQ==

"Manufacturing or assembling IoT products in Africa presents a tremendous opportunity to contribute to the region's digital transformation and build a sustainable business. One promising area could be smart energy management systems, such as smart meters and energy monitoring solutions. These products can address the growing need for efficient energy use and management across various sectors, including residential, commercial, and industrial. Additionally, they can help reduce energy wastage, lower costs, and promote sustainable energy practices.

Smart agriculture solutions are another great option. IoT devices for monitoring soil health, weather conditions, and crop health can significantly boost agricultural productivity and sustainability, which is crucial for many African economies.
