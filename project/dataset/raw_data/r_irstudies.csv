"As is typical with articles on geopolitics, the author perpetrates some deliberately bad misreadings in order to slander classical geopolitics.

Right off the bat, grouping ""Axis of Evil"" alongside the Heartland is so tendentiously misleading it could only be deliberately malicious. Axis of Evil is not and never was a geographical concept, unlike the Heartland. The author doesn't bother to explain the Heartland, just said it's deterministic, which is incorrect at best.

The most laughable part of the meat of the article is that is almost no geography at all! The author abstracts everything into networks and connections and interstate power relations (which is just international relations, not geopolitics).

The final bit about peacemaking is the most ironic portion, given where the author started condemning the Heartland thesis. Mackinder's Heartland piece was advice to the League of Nations - the international organization charged with promoting and preserving international peace following WWI - on the need to provide security guarantees to Eastern Europe, where he thought another war might break out.  As we all recall, Nazi Germany and Communist Russia divided Eastern Europe between themselves and then WWII broke out when Hitler broke the pact to invade Poland, conquer Eastern Europe, and attempt to defeat the USSR. The League of Nations had not followed Mackinder's advice, the United States had backed out, and Poland was left defenseless. The Heartland thesis was for the League of Nations as a peacebuilding effort, but the author hasn't done the first thing to understand the texts he's slandering.",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXWk1DeUpDZE1HZFROLVNsT0d0SC1HTnBjSWNURzJRTW83S01GU0hHUFNHSDlVVGpobXUzNWxkUEtYdnYxazRfOUFGV1l6MTRIQk8xYktBWU1jQUU5bXVkYUJEdkdHMG5wUV9UYTd3dHliSzg9

"I was closely considering the Sciences Po Paris programme.

I'd definitely apply to Oxford. I know one person on the programme (at St Anthony's College, I believe), and it all looks extremely fascinating. I'm not sure if you're looking to specialise in a region but St Anthony's is also very good for anything to do with the Middle East (if you're interested in learning Arabic, Turkish or Persian) with the academic 'big names' to go alongside it and have very good archives too!

Those all look like amazing programmes; if you're considering Oxford, I would also visit a few colleges if you're able. Your college isn't the be-all and end-all but they can all be very different in terms of the type of people they attract (and academics too!). It's quite a rigorous programme, but they definitely seem to be looking for people from different backgrounds. I'm quite sure there are scholarships to assist with the immoderate price tag, so I would certainly apply!

Sciences Po Paris is also excellent, I know a guy who went there and has nothing but good things to say. Unfortunately for us Brits, we no longer pay EU fees, which was one of the deciding factors that made me stay in the UK! As for Lille, I'm not too sure, but it's a very liveable city and probably excellent to be a student in. The faculty also seems prestigious, but the smaller Sciences Pos across France (Grenoble, Strasbourg etc.) always seem to punch above their weight! My dissertation supervisor studied at Grenoble which led to him having quite a successful career in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then academia.

"Congrats on having two great options! I’m not an FSO, but I work with some and am considering it, so I’m familiar with the process. My impression is that spending time abroad and having language skills is valuable. It will give you opportunities to display the key skills (dimensions) that they’re looking for. 

I would consider CBYX if you don’t have much experience abroad or if this exchange fits your interests. For example, is your area of expertise Germany/EU? Can you get involved in projects or research that aligns with your goals? Then CBYX can probably strengthen your FSO or grad school prospects. 

That said, the fed government is hard to break into and it sounds like a sweet gig at Justice. Being a civil servant, or having a Master’s degree, doesn’t necessarily help you join the FS, everyone has to take the FSOT and is graded on the same skills, but you may also build professional experience (dimensions!) which will give you stuff to talk about in your PNs, OEP, etc. Alternatively, that job at DoJ, plus a Master’s if you so choose, could open doors to interesting IR jobs in the civil service.",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNXMWV0UzFrb2FrX0JEWk1oUmFYSm9Kc2RiQ0lDWlBzbjdXWEhKV2djdHNaOFZ6RDRPTTdhVTBHc3U3RE5yVWJ1TS13V0hCWG9yVXVSb1RZTVdWbk9VZ3c9PQ==
">But Russia is asking for hegemony over all of Eastern Europe in return.

Are they though?  Or are they simply asking that we don't build up a hostile alliance on every border we can?


>Asking the US to throw dozens of allies out of NATO

Again, I don't think this is what the Russians are requesting, but even if it were, NATO loses the Baltic states and some of the Balkan states?  These are not powerful allies anyway.  They are unlikely to swing the pendulum in any major conflict. All three Baltic states together have a population of 6 million, and that includes women, children, the disabled and the elderly.  Even in total war, they could contribute about 1.5 million and that would effectively be a fight to the death.

Please. Why the fuck do you think will happen when they no longer have any allies? Russia's stated policy is to take back their former territories. Putin has said this many times, he published a whole article about it a few months before the war. He says it in the Tucker Carlson interview too.

I'm not worried about it.  I think a lot gets discussed that is never seriously considered.  I think this is making a mountain out of a molehill.  And as far as power projection goes, Russia gains what exactly from an island 200 miles north of Kaliningrad? Anything they could hit from there, they can hit from Kaliningrad. 

Your second article is a joke.  It's a lot of words to convince you that he said something he didn't say.  They go all the way back to the 12th century and the etymology of the word Ukraine to make their point.  It's ridiculous.

"I'm an American and I feel like my International Studies Masters is basically an obsolete degree that was built for the mid to late 20th century in a Cold War context where the country was trying to build a more extensive foreign policy apparatus to counter Communism. The need for that exhausted itself and the field is now aged out, and by a country mile, it now seems to most effectively serve people now who already have a foot in the door who want to move ahead or sterling golden child type students who are very focused. I believe that it has little if any particular advantage with respect to entering public service or international-related careers these days vis a vis other academic displines and degrees.

The pipelines into public service that do exist for somebody without prior professional experience or status as a military veteran ect are totally saturated with brilliant people who went into it with a highly targeted approach who have clearly targeted sterling records and a clear trackrecord in service of a working in a specific area, or they have critical language fluency and specific in demand technical skillsets.

Internships are hit or miss insofar as getting a job and are in expensive places and you can't realistically do them unless you're willing to live in poverty or have wealthy parents. I know people who did State Department internships and intenrships in think tanks who bailed out because they still couldn't translate it into a career.

I went to an elite school for my Masters and I'm a few years out from graduating and I see lots of people in my cohort who are doing things unrelated or are serving at a much lower level than they thought they would (like local and state government and regional NGOs), people who went to law school, people who got unrelated additional degrees in things like Cybersecurity and Data Science. The people who did the economics track by far seem to have the most latitude.

I've found that the career services people for my alma matter are defensive with students and are failed international relations professionals themselves. Interacting with them was a frustrating and dissapointing experience.

I've found that I lose out to people with law degrees and Masters of Public Administration for policy jobs, I lose out majorly to people with secuirty clearances for intelligence work, I lose out to people who were more targeted for NGOs or people who did things like the American Peace Corps (something for which I applied and am waiting on).

I don't regret getting the degree in and of itself because it made me much smarter and more dynamic and allowed me to find strengths and talents I didn't know I had, but I completely exhausted myself trying to find a route in and I'm going to probably end up getting more specific credentials and education to supplement it and find a much more clear and direct career path.

"I don't regret it overall, because I knew going in the employment prospects were not great. 

What I do regret is:

- Not being more involved in extracurricular student life, particularly during my undergrad. Most of my friends were not in my program which meant missing out on having friends to share that particular interest with, plus a stronger network of people actually in the field after graduating. 

- Not sticking out a couple of undergrad econ courses. They were dry and difficult but I think they would have added a lot of value to my studies. 

- Not picking a region / topic and sticking to it. I kind of bounced between Middle Eastern counterinsurgency/counterterrorism studies, sub-Saharan African peacekeeping, and Sino-African relations and came out of my undergrad and masters feeling like I knew a decent amount about all of them but was not particularly strong in any of them. 

- Not taking the study of a second language more seriously. From everything I've seen speaking an additional language is a HUGE asset in the field (if not a borderline requirement, especially if you are going to be regionally focused which as others have mentioned is the majority of IR jobs). As a Canadian French is super important if you want to go into most government roles, and a third language would really set you apart after that. 

- Not giving a ton of meaningful thought or research into what I wanted to do until I was getting close to finishing my masters. 

- Not planning for a masters until my final year of undergrad and then not assessing my masters program choices based on any metric other than the country it was in and the ranking it had in that country. I really wanted to go to the UK and picked based on British rankings without any thought for how the program actually matched my career goals or interests. 

- Not considering how working eligibility would factor into my career options and how the country I am eligible to work in would affect those options. 



- Not taking networking more seriously until later. I hated the term until my latter university years, it was so vague and yet thrown around so often. I avoided it because I didn't want to make sense of it, yet ultimately all it is is getting to know people and talking to them about what they do (and usually they're pretty interesting anyways) 

All that being said I'm still glad I chose IR (and poli sci) as an academic career path because it lead me to where I am now and I am happy with what I am doing and where I am in life. If you had asked me in the first year after graduating from my MA when I was working in a shitty call center job and struggling to even get a reply to a job application I would have given you a very different answer, so don't lose hope and with some hard work and good luck you'll look back at this post in a few years and hopefully feel like you made the right choice after all!",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYc21UdWs0UGZ5cDBac2VUVGM2bnU1djZNdEljWXcwQ0JEazZ1Rm5XbVhNRlczSWhZV0I4TFFNTE1oVE5tSDlCOTB5ZUQ5NFFhSFJYNnFJaklSRXFZcXZKSHA0a3dZVGd0cDZQb0Z0bWV0Z1k9
"Not really. I think it depends more on the country. Here in Australia, IR is still considered a major field of study. There’s a massive academic base for it, and many government positions will accept an IR or PolSci degree as a tertiary qualification.

"Mearsheimer contradicts himself in one key area

He claims nato troops on the border of Russia ( in Ukraine and Georgia ) are perceived by Russia as an existential threat and understands why Russia invaded these two countries 

But Iran is open about destroying Israel ( and Iran is already shown to be willing to kill millions of people in Yemen, Iraq, Syria Lebanon ) to protect its interests 
And when Iran has allies in Hezbollah and Hamas directly on Israel’s border he blames Israel for wanting to conquer and destroy Hezbollah and Hamas

In this scenario Iran is the USA and its proxies in Hamas Hezbollah and the Houthis are nato forces on Israel’s border - of course Israel would want to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah

And Hamas Hezbollah Iran and the Houthis are much bigger existential threats to Israel then nato forces are to Russia

">I guess that is the reason why IR graduates first work in companies to then later join NGOs?

I think there’s just a major misunderstanding across the academic spectrum about what a degree does. Studying IR does not inherently mean that you are then qualified and capable of working at an NGO. It means you *generally* understand what an NGO does in the broader context of foreign affairs. Taking a class on international development doesn’t mean you’re suddenly prepared to be a project manager overseeing a PEPFAR program for CARE. 

It’s up to you to go get the experience necessary to be qualified for an NGO. Whether you want to work in programming, policy, or as HR, you can’t just apply and expect to get it because you studied IR.

"I don't know anyone personally but I've heard very good things. I think LinkedIn can be quite useful with this sort of thing as you can find people who work in positions you'd be interested in (and specific organisations you're interested in) and see where they went to University/Grad School and what they specialised in (but you've probably done this already!). It seems like the Grad Institute is definitely well-represented in many IGO jobs. The programme looks specialised (which is very good for a Master's degree in a competitive field!), the faculty seems excellent and Geneva's a very nice city (albeit expensive). 

  
I suppose the question is, what do you want to specialise in, and what would you like to get from what you study (other than good employment prospects)? If your interests are more along the lines of international history and the history of diplomacy, it seems like the first two programmes would suit you better than the second two. In terms of diplomacy (but more history-focused), the Vienna School of International Studies might be really good too, but I don't want to complicate your decision-making!

At the end of the day, I'd follow what you're really interested in, I'm sure the rest will follow. You've done very well to get to a stage where you're considering all of these extremely prestigious programmes and I think studying something that really fascinates you will help when you have to write your MA Dissertation or even further research if you find something you'd like to investigate at PhD level!

Best of luck and let us know how it goes!",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYZWJNMXdyYmk0dGRDenU2Mnp5Nm5Db215ZWwyQ0U0dGdLYXZmelN5bE9zQjh5dTRkTVB6Sk9JZmY3RklkdlZOTFBJUXZ4VlQtb3JXTFZmS1hoYmczaUE9PQ==

"I think it really depends on what interests you the most!

I studied Arabic as the faculty is very good where I was at university. I was able to study in three countries across the Middle East and loved it! Do I sometimes consider what it would be like if I went to Taiwan to study Mandarin or studied Russian instead... Or even Japanese or Finnish? Of course!

I think the other thing you could look at is choosing a more narrow field of study to specialise in (Conflict & conflict stabilisation, international political economy, political economy of development etc.)

At the end of the day, I think it's very difficult to go wrong if you specialise in either of these ways. Unfortunately, I think being a generalist is less celebrated by the education system and when getting a job. Those skills, however, will really help you once you're in your desired career field. 

Learning a language takes a lot of time, (as does studying conflicts and potential solutions, for example) so I'd take your time and don't worry too much about it. Once you find something that really interests you, the rest will follow.

In terms of languages, sometimes really niche is good (think maybe Vietnamese, Persian, Khmer, Swahili, Indonesian, Polish) but it really depends on what part of the world you'd like to specialize in (and probably live in for quite a while too) and which more-narrow field of study sparks your interest. If you factor in where you'd like to study and what languages they offer, I think it would give you a good idea of what's available to you. Maybe you can also look up some of the more interesting-looking professors, what they teach, and their research interests (see if both of these things align with what you would like to study). 

In summary: Don't worry about specialising too much at this stage. Many successful people in the IR field only did so down the line (Master's and sometimes PhD). Focus on your interests and play to your strengths in terms of skills. Above all choose somewhere you'd enjoy being!

Best of luck and I'm sure you'll make the right decisions for you.",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYM1ZhcC01cWUxVXRseklkS1lfZ2hwRGhmQ1BUUFo2ZXVkSkRsbm5OZVBXVC05c1pZR2ViQUJ6dGJ1ckdmSFlCR0FfSjZ4b0syMExlVTA4ZnQyNTVlTlE9PQ==
"Risk and due diligence consulting, it's not really within the field of IR but definitely relies on the research and writing skills IR grads develop, and occasionally deals with loosely IR-related subjects (sanctions, political exposure, country risk, etc). 95% of my co-workers have IR degrees or very similar.

I also struggled with the litigation reporting side of what I do, as I had no background in law so rapidly consuming and summarizing court documents was a steep learning curve, but that came with time and I have little issue doing it now.",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYTjJ4aHZNYnlCdmZBbTFIX3M1S0xVS1I4aENUaEV1T3BqMEJ5Qm5ZWU1WTklPbTZfNHYxR081WGJYUFZHVzVZY1VhQkpGeU4yWjEtSmtUcFRhMWRfUkhjT0JMY0djTkFkRDM5N1ZfM2prY3M9
"I feel like the problem with degrees like IR, history, sociology etc as that it doesn’t offer a clear cut path as some other social science degrees like economics do. 

While it’s all good to focus on orgs like government, the UN, NGOs etc I wouldn’t count on getting in at least right away.

You have to be creative in your job hunt and put energy towards places that might not relate to the degree.

Also, if it makes you feel any better the economy right now in most developed countries isn’t great at all.

"I got a sort of IR master (it was on international security), because I was interested and I wanted to know more. I think that should be the primary outset of getting an IR degree; you do it because it interests you. Always keep the expectations low on actual jobs, as long as you're doing what really interests you. I first wanted to do my thesis on counterinsurgency in Pakistan but ended up doing it on cyberwarfare (in 2012) because I wanted to know more about a field that felt very underexplored. The decision also come after meeting Pakistani people that made me realize I'll never really be able to make very in-depth analyses on a country I'll at most read about from 2nd and 3rd degree sources without learning Urdu. 

Many here have recommended specialisation and learning another language if you want to stay in IR and I can wholeheartedly confirm, but another avenue to take is also to up your digital skills and pursue an IR carreer on internet affairs. I did some cybersecurity MOOCs to level up my knowledge on the technical side, and ended up working on national cybersecurity for a few years, and later in European cyberdiplomacy. I've now (age 35) gone back to uni to do a PhD on international platform governance because it interests me, and who knows what i'll do after.

 I'm not saying there's jobs galore in cyber, but there's not that many people able to translate digital matters to the (international) policy level. I also did a small stint in the private sector and while it wasn't for me, I realized I could always fall back on it.",r/irstudies,Z0FBQUFBQm0yeGNYMm1rTUhXOHFYOFFFeTlxT0FSeHlvX1pOQWhhT28tcHBSV1lNeXVZR1cydF9EaFlQcXJRUlhqd0ZkeWxkbl9uQTdpZDd4eHdEcXZWbFV2VkRXY3gxTXc9PQ==

Make sure you have sterling recommendations and a clear research plan that matches department faculty interests. Full time UK phds should also provide funding. Otherwise here’s a loose list:
- Princeton, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Cal, UChicago, Columbia
- UCSD, UW Madison, GWU, Georgetown, JHU, Tufts, BU, UT-Austin, Duke
- LSE, Oxbridge, St Andrew’s, King’s, UCL, SOAS
